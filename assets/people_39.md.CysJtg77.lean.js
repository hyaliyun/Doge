Public law, private law, designation  Private Law 86-407 Public Law 86-90 (STATUTE-073-1-2), Page 212 In the United States, Acts of Congress are designated as either public laws, relating to the general public, or private laws, relating to specific institutions or individuals. Since 1957, all Acts of Congress have been designated as \\"Public Law X-Y\\" or \\"Private Law X-Y\\", where X is the number of the Congress and Y refers to the sequential order of the bill (when it was enacted). For example, P. L. 111-5 (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) was the fifth enacted public law of the 111th United States Congress. Public laws are also often abbreviated as Pub. L. No. X-Y. When the legislation of those two kinds is proposed, it is called public bill and private bill respectively. Usage The word \\"act\\", as used in the term \\"Act of Congress\\", is a common, not a proper noun. The capitalization of the word \\"act\\" (especially when used standing alone to refer to an act mentioned earlier by its full name) is deprecated by some dictionaries and usage authorities.Bartleby.com 2Infoplease.comCambridge.comMerriam- Webster.comEncyclop√¶dia Britannica However, the Bluebook requires \\"Act\\" to be capitalized when referring to a specific legislative act.The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, 20th ed., Rule R8(c)(ii) (Cambridge: The Harvard Law Review Association, 2015), 92. The United States Code capitalizes \\"Act\\". The term \\"Act of Congress\\" is sometimes used in informal speech to indicate something for which getting permission is burdensome. For example, \\"It takes an Act of Congress to get a building permit in this town.\\" Promulgation (United States) An act adopted by simple majorities in both houses of Congress is promulgated, or given the force of law, in one of the following ways: # Signature by the president of the United States, # Inaction by the president after ten days from reception (excluding Sundays) while the Congress is in session, or # Reconsideration by the Congress after a presidential veto during its session. (A bill must receive a majority vote in both houses to override a president's veto.) The president promulgates Acts of Congress made by the first two methods. If an act is made by the third method, the presiding officer of the house that last reconsidered the act promulgates it.See , \\"Promulgation of laws\\". Under the United States Constitution, if the president does not return a bill or resolution to Congress with objections before the time limit expires, then the bill automatically becomes an act; however, if the Congress is adjourned at the end of this period, then the bill dies and cannot be reconsidered (see pocket veto). In addition, if the President rejects a bill or resolution while the Congress is in session, a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Congress is needed for reconsideration to be successful. Promulgation in the sense of publishing and proclaiming the law is accomplished by the president, or the relevant presiding officer in the case of an overridden veto, delivering the act to the archivist of the United States., \\"Promulgation of laws\\". After the archivist receives the act, he or she provides for its publication as a slip law and in the United States Statutes at Large., Little and Brown's' edition of laws and treaties; slip laws; Treaties and Other International Acts Series; admissibility in evidence\\"., \\"Statutes at Large; contents; admissibility in evidence\\". Thereafter, the changes are published in the United States Code. Through the process of judicial review, an Act of Congress that violates the Constitution may be declared unconstitutional by the courts. The judicial declaration of an act's unconstitutionality does not remove the law from the statute books; rather, it prevents the law from being enforced. However, future publications of the act are generally annotated with warnings indicating that the statute is no longer valid law.

The Miller cycle was patented by Ralph Miller, an American engineer, US patent 2817322 dated Dec 24, 1957. The engine may be two- or four-stroke and may be run on diesel fuel, gases, or dual fuel. This type of engine was first used in ships and stationary power-generating plants, and is now used for some railway locomotives such as the GE PowerHaul. It was adapted by Mazda for their KJ-ZEM V6, used in the Millenia sedan, and in their Eunos 800 sedan (Australia) luxury cars. More recently, Subaru has combined a Miller-cycle flat-4 with a hybrid driveline for their concept \\"Turbo Parallel Hybrid\\" car, known as the Subaru B5-TPH, and Nissan has introduced a small three-cylinder engine with variable intake valve timing that claims to operate an Atkinson cycle at low load (thus the lower power density is not a handicap), or a Miller cycle when under light boost in the low-pressure, supercharged variant, returning to regular (and either suction or more strongly supercharged), more power-dense Otto cycle operation at higher loads. In the latter example, the particular nature of the Miller cycle permits the supercharged version to not only be moderately more powerful, but also claim better, almost diesel-like fuel economy with lower emissions than the (simpler, cheaper) suction-intake one - in contrast to the usual situation of supercharging causing significantly increased fuel consumption.  Overview  A traditional reciprocating internal combustion engine uses four strokes, of which two can be considered high-power: the compression stroke (high power flow from crankshaft to the charge) and power stroke (high power flow from the combustion gases to crankshaft). In the Miller cycle, the intake valve is left open longer than it would be in an Otto-cycle engine. In effect, the compression stroke is two discrete cycles: the initial portion when the intake valve is open and final portion when the intake valve is closed. This two- stage intake stroke creates the so-called \\"fifth\\" stroke that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger. The supercharger typically will need to be of the positive-displacement (Roots or screw) type due to its ability to produce boost at relatively low engine speeds. Otherwise, low-rpm power will suffer. Alternatively, a turbocharger can be used for greater efficiency, if low rpm operation is not required, or supplimented with electric motors. In the Miller-cycle engine, the piston begins to compress the fuel-air mixture only after the intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, and back into the intake manifold. =Charge temperature= The charge air is compressed using a supercharger (and cooled by an intercooler) to a pressure higher than that needed for the engine cycle, but filling of the cylinders is reduced by suitable timing of the inlet valve. Thus the expansion of the air and the consequent cooling take place in the cylinders and partially in the inlet. Reducing the temperature of the air/fuel charge allows the power of a given engine to be increased without making any major changes such as increasing the cylinder/piston compression relationship. When the temperature is lower at the beginning of the cycle, the air density is increased without a change in pressure (the mechanical limit of the engine is shifted to a higher power). At the same time, the thermal load limit shifts due to the lower mean temperatures of the cycle. Doug Woodyard \\"Pounder's Marine Diesel Engines and Gas Turbines\\" (Ninth Edition), 2009 This allows ignition timing to be advanced beyond what is normally allowed before the onset of detonation, thus increasing the overall efficiency still further. An additional advantage of the lower final charge temperature is that the emission of NOx in diesel engines is decreased, which is an important design parameter in large diesel engines on board ships and power plants. =Compression ratio= Efficiency is increased by having the same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded to almost atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary spark ignition engine at the end of the expansion stroke of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas. Delaying the closing of the intake valve in the Miller cycle in effect shortens the compression stroke compared to the expansion stroke. This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle. =Supercharger losses= The benefits of using positive-displacement superchargers come with a cost due to parasitic load. About 15 to 20% of the power generated by a supercharged engine is usually required to do the work of driving the supercharger, which compresses the intake charge (also known as boost). =Major advantage/drawback= The major advantage of the cycle is that the expansion ratio is greater than the compression ratio. By intercooling after the external supercharging, an opportunity exists to reduce NOx emissions for diesel, or knock for spark ignition engine. However, multiple tradeoffs on boosting system efficiency and friction (due to the larger displacement) need to be balanced for every application. Summary of the patent The overview given above may describe a modern version of the Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes \\"a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine\\". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It is clear from the context that \\"gas\\" means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional \\"compression control valve\\" (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This \\"will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads\\". Atkinson-cycle engine A similar delayed valve-closing method is used in some modern versions of Atkinson cycle engines, but without the supercharging. These engines are generally found on hybrid electric vehicles, where efficiency is the goal, and the power lost compared to the Miller cycle is made up through the use of electric motors.

He was a patrician Claudian on his birth father's side but his maternal grandmother was from a plebeian family. He was the son of Livia Drusilla and the legal stepson of her second husband, the Emperor Augustus. He was also brother of the Emperor Tiberius, father to both the Emperor Claudius and general Germanicus, paternal grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, and maternal great-grandfather of the Emperor Nero. He launched the first major Roman campaigns across the Rhine and began the conquest of Germania, becoming the first Roman general to reach the Weser and Elbe rivers. In 12 BC, Drusus led a successful campaign into Germania, subjugating the Sicambri. Later that year he led a naval expedition against Germanic tribes along the North Sea coast, conquering the Batavi and the Frisii, and defeating the Chauci near the mouth of the Weser. In 11 BC, he conquered the Usipetes and the Marsi, extending Roman control to the Upper Weser. In 10 BC, he launched a campaign against the Chatti and the resurgent Sicambri, subjugating both. The following year, while serving as consul, he conquered the Mattiaci and defeated the Marcomanni and the Cherusci, the latter near the Elbe. However, Drusus died later that year, depriving Rome of one of its best generals. Childhood Drusus was the youngest son of Livia Drusilla from her marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero, who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married Augustus on 17 January.Donna W. Hurley, Suetonius: Divus Claudius (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 106 Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of March 28 as his most likely birthday,At Divus Claudius 11.3, Suetonius says that Claudius as emperor commemorated the birthday (dies natalis) of his father Drusus on the same date as that of Mark Antony, his maternal grandfather, whose birthday on January 14, ca. 83 BC, had been decreed as a \\"defective\\" day (dies vitiosus) by Augustus (Cassius Dio 51.9.3). However, since Drusus's birth is also recorded as occurring within the third month after Livia's marriage to Augustus on January 17, Radke proposes that Claudius used the astronomical discrepancies between the pre-Julian calendar under which Antony was born and the Julian calendar in effect at the time of Drusus' birth, to show that had the two been born under the same calendar, they would have shared a birthday. Gilbert Radke (1978), \\"Der Geburtstag des √§lteren Drusus,\\" Wurzburger Jahrbucher fur die Altertumswissenschaft 4 (1978), pp. 211‚Äì213. Reviewing these theories, Anthony A. Barrett still considers January 14 the most probable birthdate, explaining the apparent three-month discrepancy as referring to Livia's betrothal, not her marriage . while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid's Fasti as indicating a date of 13 January. Rumors arose that Augustus was the child's real father, although this has never been authoritatively proven. Claudius, however, encouraged the rumor during his reign as emperor to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus. According to Suetonius, Drusus was originally given Decimus as his praenomen, the first of a Roman male's conventional three names in Roman naming practice at the time. Nero was a traditional cognomen (third name) of the Claudii, whereas Drusus was given to a branch of the gens Livia. Using a cognomen such as Nero as a first name was unusual, as was the prominence given to his maternal lineage in adopting Drusus as his cognomen. Drusus was raised in Claudius Nero's house with his brother, the future emperor Tiberius, until his legal father's death. The two brothers developed a famously close relationship that would last the rest of their lives. Tiberius named his eldest son after his brother, and Drusus did likewise, although eldest sons were usually named after their father or grandfather.  Marriage  The Juno Ludovisi, a 1st-century CE depiction of Drusus' wife Antonia Minor as Juno Drusus married Antonia Minor, the daughter of Mark Antony and Augustus' sister, Octavia Minor, and gained a reputation of being completely faithful to her.Valerius Maximus, Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX IV.3.3 (Latin text). Cited in . Their children were Germanicus, Claudius, a daughter named Livilla ('little Livia'), and at least two others who did not survive infancy. After Drusus' death, Antonia never remarried, though she outlived him by nearly five decades. Three emperors were direct descendants of Drusus: his son Claudius, his grandson Caligula, and his great-grandson Nero. Career Augustus bestowed many honors on his stepsons. In 19 BC, Drusus was granted the ability to hold all public offices five years before the minimum age. When Tiberius left Italy during his term as praetor in 16 BC, Drusus legislated in his place. He became quaestor the following year, fighting against Raetian bandits in the Alps. Drusus repelled them, gaining honors, but was unable to smash their forces, and required reinforcement from Tiberius. The brothers easily defeated the local Alpine tribes. Drusus arrived in Gaul in late 15 BC to serve as legatus Augusti pro praetore (governor on Augustus' behalf with the authority of a praetor) of the three Gaulish provinces. His contribution to the ongoing building and urban development in Gaul can be seen in the establishment of the pes Drusianus, or ‚ÄòDrusian foot‚Äô, of about , which was in use in Samarobriva (modern Amiens) and among the Tungri. From 14 to 13 BC, Augustus himself was also active in Gaul, whether in Lugdunum (modern Lyon) or along the Rhine frontier. As governor of Gaul, Drusus made his headquarters at Lugdunum, where he decided to establish the concilium Galliarum or ‚Äòcouncil of the Gaulish provinces‚Äô sometime between 14 and 12 BC. This council would elect from its members a priest to celebrate games and venerate Rome and Augustus as deities every 1 August at the altar of the three Gauls that Drusus established at Condate in 10 BC. Drusus' son Tiberius‚Äîthe future emperor Claudius‚Äîwas born in Lugdunum on the same day that this altar was inaugurated. =Germanic campaigns= Germanic tribes, 12-9 BC Starting in 14 BC, Drusus built a string of military bases along the Rhine‚Äîfifty according to Florus‚Äîand established an alliance with the Batavi in preparation for military action in Germania Libera. He is likely to have had seven legions under his command.These were, according to , Legiones I Germanica, V Alaudae, XIII Gemina, XIV Gemina, XVI Gallica, XVII, XVIII, and XIX (the last three being the legions that would later be destroyed while under the command of Varus). In spring of 12 BC, he embarked an expeditionary force, perhaps consisting of the Legiones I Germanica and V Alaudae, by ship from the vicinity of modern Nijmegen, making use of one or more canals he had built for the purpose. Drusus sailed to the mouth of the Ems and penetrated into the territory of the Chauci in present-day Lower Saxony. The Chauci concluded a treaty acknowledging Roman supremacy, and would remain allies of Rome for years to come. As they continued to ascend the Ems, the Romans were attacked by the Bructeri in boats. Drusus' forces defeated the Bructeri, but, as it was now late in the campaign season, turned back for their winter quarters in Gaul, taking advantage of their new alliance with the Frisii to navigate through the difficult conditions on the North Sea. As a reward for the successes of his campaign in 12 BC, Drusus was made praetor urbanus for 11 BC when he returned to Rome for the winter. News of Drusus' achievements‚Äînavigating the North Sea, carrying the Roman eagles into new territory, and fixing new peoples into treaty relations with Rome‚Äîcaused considerable excitement in Rome and were commemorated on coins. Drusus did not have it in him to stay in Rome. In the spring of his term as praetor urbanus, he set out for the German border once more. This time, he assembled a force consisting of all or part of five legions in addition to auxiliaries and, setting out from Vetera on the Rhine, ascended the River Lippe. Here he encountered the Tencteri and Usipetes, whom he defeated in two separate engagements.. The legions in question this time were the I Germanica, the V Alaudae, the XVII, the XVIII, and the XIX. He reached the Werra Valley before deciding to turn back for the season, as winter was coming on, supplies were dwindling, and the omens were unfavorable. While his forces were making their way back through the territory of the Cherusci, the latter tribe laid an ambush for them at Arbalo. The Cherusci failed to capitalize on their initial advantage, whereupon the Romans broke through their lines, defeated the Germanic attackers, and acclaimed Drusus as imperator. To show his continued mastery of the ground, Drusus garrisoned a number of positions within Germania during the winter of 11‚Äì10 BC, including one somewhere in Hesse and one in Cheruscan territory, probably either the camp at Haltern or that at Bergkamen- Oberaden, both in present-day North Rhine‚ÄìWestphalia. He rejoined his wife Antonia and two children for a time in Lugdunum before the family returned to Rome, where Drusus reported to Augustus. Drusus was given the honor of an ovation, and for the second time, Augustus closed the doors of the Temple of Janus, signifying that the whole Roman world was then at peace. Drusus was granted the office of proconsul for the following year. In 10 BC, the Chatti joined with the Sicambri and attacked Drusus' camp, but they were driven back. Drusus pursued them, proceeding from the sites of present-day Mainz and R√∂dgen, where he set up a base of supply, to Hedem√ºnden, where a strong new camp was established. Around this time, the canny Marcomannic king Maroboduus responded to the Roman incursion by relocating his people en masse to Bohemia. In summer of 10 BC, Drusus left the field in order to return to Lugdunum, where he inaugurated the sanctuary of the Three Gaulish provinces at Condate on 1 August. Augustus and Tiberius were in Lugdunum for this occasion (when Drusus' youngest son Claudius was born), and afterwards Drusus accompanied them back to Rome. Drusus easily won election as consul for the year 9 BC. Once more he left the city before assuming office. His consulship conferred the chance for Drusus to attain Rome's highest and rarest military honor, the spolia opima, or spoils of an enemy chieftain slain personally by an opposing Roman general who was fighting (as consuls did) under his own auspices. He quickly returned to the field, stopping to confer with his staff at Lugdunum and to dedicate a temple to Caesar Augustus at Andemantunnum, before rejoining his command at Mainz, from which the year's expedition departed in early spring. Drusus led the army via R√∂dgen through the territories of the Marsi and Cherusci until he even crossed the river Elbe. Here he is said to have seen an apparition of a Germanic woman who warned him against proceeding farther and that his death was near. Drusus turned back, erecting a trophy to commemorate his reaching the Elbe, perhaps on the site of Dresden or Magdeburg. Drusus had sought out multiple Germanic (at least three) chieftains during his campaigns in Germany (12 BC‚Äì9 BC), engaging them in \\"dazzling displays of single combat\\". The sources are ambiguous, but suggest that he could have potentially taken the spolia opima from a Germanic king, thus becoming the fourth and final Roman to gain this honor. and note 155 on p. 199, citing Suetonius Claudius I.4. Regardless of whether he was actually able to take them in combat, however, Drusus' untimely death would prevent him from ever going through with the official ceremony. Notably, after Drusus' death, Augustus deposited the laurels from his fasces not in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus as he had done in the past, but in the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. J.W. Rich suggests that this action was done as an affirmation to Drusus' memory; had the young commander lived, he would have placed spolia opima in the temple himself.Rich, J. W. ‚ÄúDrusus and the Spolia Opima.‚Äù The Classical Quarterly, vol. 49, no. 2, 1999, pp. 544‚Äì555. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/639878. Accessed 10 Aug. 2020. Death and legacy Drusus was returning from his advance to the Elbe when he fell from his horse,Barbara Levick, Claudius (Yale University Press, Sep. 10, 1993), p. 11. lingering on for a month after the accident, by which point Tiberius had joined him. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter to Tiberius complaining about the style in which Augustus ruled. Suetonius reports that he had refused to return to Rome just before his death. Drusus' body was brought back to the city, and his ashes were deposited in the Mausoleum of Augustus. He remained extremely popular with the legionaries, who erected a monument (the Drususstein) in Mogontiacum (modern Mainz) on his behalf. Remnants of this are still standing. The Senate raised an arch on the Appian Way in his memorySuetonius, Claudius I.1.3 (unrelated to the Arch of Drusus) which read \\"DE GERM\\" and depicted his Elbe trophy as well as him fighting on horseback, a testament to his personal bravery. They also posthumously granted him the hereditary honorific title \\"Germanicus\\", which was given to his eldest son before passing to his youngest. It would be used by many members of the Julio- Claudian dynasty, including its last three emperors: his grandson Caligula, his son Claudius, and his great-grandson Nero. Augustus later wrote a biography of him which does not survive. By Augustus' decree, festivals were held in Mogontiacum at Drusus' death day and probably also on his birthday.Suetonius, Claudius I.1.3 Drusus' mother Livia, much affected by the death of her second son, took the advice of the philosopher Areus to put up many statues and images of Drusus and speak often about him. The surviving Latin work Consolatio ad Liviam is framed as an Ovidian message of consolation to Livia on this occasion, though it is generally considered a literary exercise \\"composed between the death of Livia [29 CE] and that of Tiberius [37 CE]\\". Augustus noted the successes of Drusus' campaigns‚Äîfor which, as Drusus' superior, he took credit‚Äîin his Res Gestae Divi Augusti, written in 14 AD: Upon Claudius' accession to the principate in 41 AD, his late father Drusus received new public honors, including annual games in the Circus Maximus on January 14 for Drusus' birthday, coin issues depicting Drusus' likeness and his commemorative arch, and the restoration of a monument near the Ara Pacis Augustae that featured a statue of Drusus. Claudius also completed a road from Italy into Raetia that followed the route Drusus had taken and whose road- markers commemorated Drusus' achievements in the Alpine war. Such Claudian commemorations of Drusus' memory are thought to have become less prominent once Claudius had his own British triumph to celebrate. Family tree In popular culture He is a minor character in Robert Graves' historical novel I, Claudius, as well as the BBC's adaptation of the same title in which he was played by Ian Ogilvy. The annual festival celebrating Drusus' death is a main plot element in the second volume of the Romanike series by Codex Regius (2006-2014). He is a prominent character in the Hrabam Chronicles by Alaric Longward (2016). See also *Arch of Drusus Notes References   Rich, J.

She may have had a brother named Gaius Livius Drusus who had a daughter named Livia Pulchra. Her father also adopted Marcus Livius Drusus Libo. She was married around 43 BC.Livia, First pLady of Imperial Rome by Anthony A Barrett, Yale University Press. Her father married her to Tiberius Claudius Nero, her cousin of patrician status who was fighting with him on the side of Julius Caesar's assassins against Octavian. Her father committed suicide in the Battle of Philippi, along with Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, but her husband continued fighting against Octavian, now on behalf of Mark Antony and his brother Lucius Antonius. Her first child, the future Emperor Tiberius, was born in 42 BC. In 40 BC, the family was forced to flee Italy in order to avoid the proscriptions issued by the Triumvirate of Octavian (later Augustus), Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Mark Antony. As did many of those proscribed, they joined with Sextus Pompeius, a son of Pompey Magnus, who opposed the triumvirate from his base in Sicily. Later, Livia, her husband Tiberius Nero and their two-year-old son, Tiberius, moved on to Greece.Fraschetti, A. Roman Women pp. 100‚Äì101. Linda Lappin (tr.) University of Chicago Press. Wife to Augustus After peace was established between the Triumvirate and the followers of Sextus Pompeius, a general amnesty was announced, and Livia returned to Rome, where she was personally introduced to Octavian in 39 BC. At this time, Livia already had a son, the future emperor Tiberius, and was pregnant with the second, Nero Claudius Drusus (also known as Drusus the Elder). Legend said that Octavian fell immediately in love with her, despite the fact that he was still married to Scribonia.Hurley, D.

Harvard University Press. Translation by Earnest Cary) Seemingly around that time, when Livia was six months pregnant, Tiberius Claudius Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. On 14 January, the child was born. Augustus and Livia married on 17 January, waiving the traditional waiting period. Tiberius Claudius Nero was present at the wedding, giving her in marriage \\"just as a father would.\\"Cassius Dio 48.44.1‚Äì3 The importance of the patrician Claudii to Octavian's cause, and the political survival of the Claudii Nerones are probably more rational explanations for the tempestuous union. Nevertheless, Livia and Augustus remained married for the next 51 years, despite the fact that they had no children apart from a single miscarriage. She always enjoyed the status of privileged counselor to her husband, petitioning him on the behalf of others and influencing his policies, an unusual role for a Roman wife in a culture dominated by the pater familias. After Mark Antony's suicide following the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian returned to Rome triumphant; on 16 January 27 BC, the Senate bestowed upon him the honorary title of Augustus (\\"honorable\\" or \\"revered one\\"). Augustus rejected monarchical titles, instead choosing to refer to himself as Princeps Civitatis (\\"First Citizen of the State\\") or Princeps Senatus (\\"First among the Senate\\"). He and Livia formed the role model for Roman households. Despite their wealth and power, Augustus' family continued to live modestly in their house on the Palatine Hill. Livia would set the pattern for the noble Roman matrona. She wore neither excessive jewelry nor pretentious costumes; she took care of the household and her husband (often making his clothes herself), always faithful and dedicated. In 35 BC, Octavian gave Livia the unprecedented honour of ruling her own finances and dedicated a public statue to her. She owned and effectively administered copper miness in Gaul, entire estates of palm groves in Judea, and dozens of papyrus marshes in Egypt. She had her own circle of clients and pushed many prot√©g√©s into political offices, including the grandfathers of the later Emperors Galba and Otho. With Augustus being the father of only one daughter (Julia by Scribonia), Livia revealed herself to be an ambitious mother and soon started to push her own sons Tiberius and Drusus into power. Drusus was a trusted general and married Augustus' favorite niece, Antonia Minor, having three children: the popular general Germanicus, Livilla, and the future emperor Claudius. Tiberius married Augustus' daughter Julia in 11 BC and was ultimately adopted as Augustus' heir in AD 4. Rumor had it that Livia was behind the death of Augustus' nephew Marcellus in 23 BC.Cassius Dio 55.33.4 After Julia's two elder sons by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and successors, had died, the one remaining son, Agrippa Postumus, was adopted at the same time as Tiberius, but later Agrippa Postumus was sent into exile and finally killed. Tacitus charges that Livia was not altogether innocent of these deathsTacitus Annals. 1.3; 1.6. (The Works of Tacitus tr. by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb 1864‚Äì1877), and Cassius Dio also mentions such rumours.Cassius Dio 53.33.4, 55.10A, 55.32; 57.3.6 There are also rumors mentioned by Tacitus and Cassius Dio that Livia brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs.Tacitus Annals 1.5Cassius Dio 55.22.2; 56.30 Augustus' granddaughter was Julia the Younger. Sometime between 1 and 14 AD, her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt.Suetonius, The Lives of Caesars, Life of Augustus 19 Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt.Norwood, Frances, \\"The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio\\" Classical Philology (1963) p. 154 Livia Drusilla plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them. This led to open compassion for the fallen family. Julia died in 29 AD on the same island where she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.Tacitus, Ann. IV, 71 Life after Augustus, death, and aftermath Sardonyx cameo of Livia with the bust of the Divus Augustus (Vienna) Augustus died on August 19, 14 AD, being deified by the Senate shortly afterwards. In his will, he left one third of his property to Livia, and the other two thirds to Tiberius. In the will, he also adopted her into the Julian family and granted her the honorific title of Augusta. These dispositions permitted Livia to maintain her status and power after her husband's death, under the new name of Julia Augusta. Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that rumours persisted that Augustus was poisoned by Livia, but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty. The most famous of these rumors was that Livia, unable to poison his food in the kitchens because Augustus insisted on only eating figs picked fresh from his garden, smeared each fruit with poison while still on the tree to pre-empt him. In Imperial times, a variety of fig cultivated in Roman gardens was called the Liviana, perhaps because of her reputed horticultural abilities, or as a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rumor. Livia and her son Tiberius, AD 14‚Äì19, from Paestum, National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid For some time, Livia and her son Tiberius, the new Emperor, appeared to get along with each other. Speaking against her became treason in AD 20, and in AD 24 he granted his mother a theater seat among the Vestal Virgins. Livia exercised unofficial but very real power in Rome. Eventually, Tiberius became resentful of his mother's political status, particularly against the idea that it was she who had given him the throne. At the beginning of his reign Tiberius vetoed the unprecedented title Mater Patriae (\\"Mother of the Fatherland\\") that the Senate wished to bestow upon her, in the same manner in which Augustus had been named Pater Patriae (\\"Father of the Fatherland\\") (Tiberius also consistently refused the title of Pater Patriae for himself). Livia Drusilla statue, from Paestum The historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio depict an overweening, even domineering dowager, ready to interfere in Tiberius‚Äô decisions. The most notable instances were the case of Urgulania (grandmother of Claudius's first wife Plautia Urgulanilla), a woman who correctly assumed that her friendship with the empress placed her above the law;Cassius Dio, 57.12Tacitus, 2.34 and Munatia Plancina, suspected of murdering Germanicus and saved at Livia's entreaty.Tacitus, 3.17 (Plancina committed suicide in AD 33 after being accused again of murder after Livia's death.) A notice from AD 22 records that Julia Augusta (Livia) dedicated a statue to Augustus in the center of Rome, placing her own name even before that of Tiberius. Ancient historians give as a reason for Tiberius' retirement to Capri: his inability to endure his mother any longer.Tacitus, 4.57 Until AD 22 there had, according to Tacitus, been \\"a genuine harmony between mother and son, or a hatred well concealed;\\"Tacitus, 3.6eirca4 Dio tells us that at the time of his accession already Tiberius heartily loathed her.Cassius Dio, 57.3.3 In AD 22 she had fallen ill, and Tiberius hastened back to Rome in order to be with her. But in AD 29 when she finally fell ill and died, he remained on Capri, pleading pressure of work and sending Caligula to deliver the funeral oration.Tacitus, 5.1Cassius Dio, 58.2Suetonius. Vita Tiberii. (The Life of Tiberius) 51. Suetonius adds the macabre detail that \\"when she died... after a delay of several days, during which he held out hope of his coming, [she was at last] buried because the condition of the corpse made it necessary...\\". Divine honors he also vetoed, stating that this was in accord with her own instructions. Later he vetoed all the honors the Senate had granted her after her death and cancelled the fulfillment of her will. It was not until 13 years later, in AD 42 during the reign of her grandson Claudius, that all her honors were restored and her deification finally completed. She was named Diva Augusta (The Divine Augusta), and an elephant-drawn chariot conveyed her image to all public games. A statue of her was set up in the Temple of Augustus along with her husband's, races were held in her honor, and women were to invoke her name in their sacred oaths. In AD 410, during the Sack of Rome, her ashes were scattered when Augustus' tomb was sacked. Her Villa ad Gallinas Albas north of Rome is currently being excavated; its famous frescoes of imaginary garden views may be seen at the National Museum of Rome. One of the most famous statues of Augustus (the Augustus of Prima Porta) came from the grounds of the villa. Personality While reporting various unsavory hearsay, the ancient sources generally portray Livia as a woman of proud and queenly attributes, faithful to her imperial husband, for whom she was a worthy consort, forever poised and dignified. With consummate skill she acted out the roles of consort, mother, widow and dowager. Dio records two of her utterances: \\"Once, when some naked men met her and were to be put to death in consequence, she saved their lives by saying that to a chaste woman such men are in no way different from statues. When someone asked her how she had obtained such a commanding influence over Augustus, she answered that it was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending neither to hear nor to notice the favourites of his passion.\\"Cassius Dio, 58.2.5 With time, however some thought that widowhood, a haughtiness and an overt craving for power and the outward trappings of status came increasingly to the fore. Livia had always been a principal beneficiary of the climate of adulation that Augustus had done so much to create, and which Tiberius despised (\\"a strong contempt for honours\\", Tacitus, Annals 4.37). In AD 24, typically, whenever she attended the theatre, a seat among the Vestals was reserved for her (Annals 4.16), and this may have been intended more as an honor for the Vestals than for her (cf. Ovid, Tristia, 4.2.13f, Epist. Ex Ponto 4.13.29f). Livia played a vital role in the formation of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. It would be interesting to know her role in this, as well as in Tiberius' divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus' insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes. The first divorce left Tiberius a foster child at the house of Octavian; the second left Tiberius with a lasting emotional scar, since he had been forced to abandon the woman he loved for dynastic considerations. In literature and popular culture =In ancient literature= In Tacitus' Annals, Livia is depicted as having great influence, to the extent where she \\"had the aged Augustus firmly under control‚Äîso much so that he exiled his only surviving grandson to the island of Planasia\\". Dupondius depicting Livia as Pietas. Livia's image appears in ancient visual media such as coins and portraits. She was the first woman to appear on provincial coins in 16 BC and her portrait images can be chronologically identified partially from the progression of her hair designs, which represented more than keeping up with the fashions of the time as her depiction with such contemporary details translated into a political statement of representing the ideal Roman woman. Livia's image evolves with different styles of portraiture that trace her effect on imperial propaganda that helped bridge the gap between her role as wife to the emperor Augustus, to mother of the emperor Tiberius. Becoming more than the \\"beautiful woman\\" she is described as in ancient texts, Livia serves as a public image for the idealization of Roman feminine qualities, a motherly figure, and eventually a goddesslike representation that alludes to her virtue. Livia's power in symbolizing the renewal of the Republic with the female virtues Pietas and Concordia in public displays had a dramatic effect on the visual representation of future imperial women as ideal, honorable mothers and wives of Rome.I Claudia II: Women in Roman art and society. Edited by Diana E. E. Kleiner and Susan B. Matheson Yale University Art Gallery. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2000. Livia is mentioned by Pliny the Elder, who describes the vines of the Pulcino wine (\\"Vinum Pucinum\\" - today at best \\"Prosecco\\"). This then special and rare wine from the sunny slopes northeast of Barcola in the direction of the place Prosecco or Duino (- near the historic place Castellum Pucinum) was according to Pliny the favorite wine of the Empress Livia. Pliny \\"The natural history of Caius Plinius Secundus\\" (approx. 77 AD), third volume, 14th book.Zeno Saracino, ‚ÄûPompei in miniatura‚Äú: la storia di ‚ÄûVallicula‚Äú o Barcola\\", In: Trieste All News, 2018-09-29. =In modern literature= In the popular fictional work I, Claudius by Robert Graves‚Äîbased on Tacitus' innuendo‚ÄîLivia is portrayed as a thoroughly Machiavellian, scheming political mastermind. Determined never to allow republican governance to flower again, as she felt they led to corruption and civil war, and devoted to bringing Tiberius to power and then maintaining him there, she is involved in nearly every death or disgrace in the Julio-Claudian family up to the time of her death. On her deathbed she only fears divine punishment for all she had done, and secures the promise of future deification by her grandson Claudius, an act which, she believes, will guarantee her a blissful afterlife. However, this portrait of her is balanced by her intense devotion to the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and her machinations are justified as a necessarily cruel means to what she firmly considers a noble aspiration: the common good of the Romans, achievable only under strict imperial rule. In the 1976 BBC television series based on the book, Livia was played by Si√¢n Phillips. Phillips won a BAFTA for her portrayal of the role. In the ITV television series The Caesars, Livia was played by Sonia Dresdel. Livia was dramatized in the HBO/BBC series Rome. Introduced in the 2007 episode \\"A Necessary Fiction\\", Livia (Alice Henley) soon catches the eye of young Octavian. Rome does acknowledge the existence of Livia's child, Tiberius, by her first husband, but not that she was pregnant with Nero Claudius Drusus when she met Octavian. Livia is portrayed as deceptively submissive in public, while in private she possesses an iron will, and a gift for political scheming that matches Atia's. In John Maddox Roberts's short story \\"The King of Sacrifices,\\" set in his SPQR series, Livia hires Decius Metellus to investigate the murder of one of Julia the Elder's lovers. In Antony and Cleopatra by Colleen McCullough, Livia is portrayed as a cunning and effective advisor to her husband, whom she loves passionately. Livia plays an important role in two Marcus Corvinus mysteries by David Wishart, Ovid (1995) and Germanicus (1997). She is mentioned posthumously in Sejanus (1998). Luke Devenish's \\"Empress of Rome\\" novels, Den of Wolves (2008) and Nest of Vipers (2010), have Livia as a central character in a fictionalized account of her life and times. Descendants Although her marriage with Augustus produced only one pregnancy, which miscarried, through her sons by her first husband, Tiberius and Drusus, she is a direct ancestor of all of the Julio-Claudian emperors as well as most of the extended Julio- Claudian imperial family. The line possibly continued for at least another century after the dynasty's downfall through the son and grandson of Livia's great-great-granddaughter Rubellia Bassa (see below); however, it is unknown whether or not this line was continued or if it became extinct. :1.

The problem is even more complex: an even older Antonia was born to a previous wife of Antony, who married Pythodorus of Tralles, Dio 44.5.3, 46.38.52 App. BC 5.10.93. That daughter is properly Antonia Major (the Elder), and the subject of the article Antonia Tertia. She was a niece of the Emperor Augustus, sister of Cleopatra Selene II, sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and both maternal great-grandmother and paternal great-aunt of the Emperor Nero. She was additionally the maternal great-aunt of the Empress Valeria Messalina and Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, the paternal grandmother of Claudia Antonia, Claudia Octavia, and Britannicus and the maternal grandmother of Julia Livia and Tiberius Gemellus. Birth and early life She was born in Athens, Greece and after 36 BC was brought to Rome by her mother and her siblings. Antonia never had the chance to know her father, Mark Antony, who divorced her mother in 32 BC and committed suicide in 30 BC. She was raised by her mother, her uncle and her aunt, Livia Drusilla. Due to inheritances, she owned properties in Italy, Greece and Egypt. She was a wealthy and influential woman who often received people who were visiting Rome. Antonia had many male friends and they included wealthy Jew Alexander the Alabarch and Lucius Vitellius, a consul and father of future Emperor Aulus Vitellius. Marriage to Drusus In 16 BC, she married the Roman general and future consul (9 BC) Nero Claudius Drusus. Drusus was the stepson of her uncle Augustus, second son of Livia Drusilla and brother of future Emperor Tiberius. They had many children, but only three survived: the famous general Germanicus, Livilla and the Roman Emperor Claudius. Antonia was the grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, the Empress Agrippina the Younger and through Agrippina, great-grandmother and great-aunt of the Emperor Nero. Drusus died in June 9 BC in Germany, due to complications from injuries he sustained after falling from a horse. After his death, although pressured by her uncle to remarry, she never did. Antonia raised her children in Rome. Tiberius adopted Germanicus in AD 4 (Suetonius Tiberius 15, Gai. 1., Div. Claudius 2). Germanicus died in 19 AD, allegedly poisoned through the handiwork of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso and Munatia Plancina. On the orders of Tiberius and Livia Drusilla, Antonia was forbidden to go to his funeral (suggested, but not stated by Tacitus Annals 3.3). When Livia Drusilla died in June 29 AD, Antonia took care of Caligula, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, Julia Livilla and later Claudia Antonia, Claudius's daughter through his second wife Aelia Paetina, her younger grandchildren. She outlived her husband, her oldest son, her daughter and several of her grandchildren. =Conflict with Livilla= In 31 AD, a plot by her daughter Livilla and Tiberius‚Äô notorious Praetorian prefect, Sejanus, was exposed by Apicata, the estranged ex-wife of Sejanus, to murder the Emperor Tiberius and Caligula and to seize the throne for themselves. Livilla allegedly poisoned her husband, Tiberius' son, Drusus Julius Caesar (nicknamed \\"Castor\\"), in 23 AD to remove him as a rival. Sejanus was executed before Livilla was implicated in the crime. After Apicata's accusation, which came in the form of a letter to the emperor, several co-conspirators were executed while Livilla was handed over to her formidable mother for punishment. Cassius Dio states that Antonia imprisoned Livilla in her room until she starved to death.Cassius Dio Histories 58.11.7 Succession of Caligula and death When Tiberius died, Caligula became emperor in March 37 AD. Caligula awarded her a senatorial decree, granting her all the honors that Livia Drusilla had received in her lifetime. She was also offered the title of Augusta, previously only given to Augustus's wife Livia, but rejected it. Six months into his reign, Caligula became seriously ill. Antonia would often offer Caligula advice, but he once told her, \\"I can treat anyone exactly as I please!\\" Caligula was rumored to have had his young cousin Gemellus beheaded, to remove him as a rival to the throne. This act was said to have outraged Antonia, who was grandmother to Gemellus as well as to Caligula. Having had enough of Caligula's anger at her criticisms and of his behavior, she committed suicide. Suetonius Caligula 23, relates how he might have poisoned her. > When his grandmother Antonia asked for a private interview, he refused it > except in the presence of the prefect Macro, and by such indignities and > annoyances he caused her death; although some think that he also gave her > poison. After she was dead, he paid her no honour, but viewed her burning > pyre from his dining-room. Antonia died on 1 May 37.Barrett, A. A., 1989, Caligula. The Corruption of Power, 62. The date is derived from the Fasti Ostienses which states that Antonia died on the Kalends of May, 'K. Mais Antonia diem suum obit', supplied by Smallwood, E., 1967, Documents Illustrating The Principates of Gaius, Claudius and Nero, Cambridge University Press, no. 31, p. 28. When Claudius became emperor after his nephew's assassination in 41 AD, he gave his mother the title of Augusta. Her birthday became a public holiday, which had yearly games and public sacrifices held. An image of her was paraded in a carriage.

It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. Antonia is one of the main characters in the novel I, Claudius. In the television adaptation of the book she is portrayed by Margaret Tyzack. She is a loyal wife deeply in love with her husband Nero Claudius Drusus. However, she is unloving towards her son Claudius, whom she regards as a fool. Furthermore, after finding evidence that Livilla murdered her husband Drusus Julius Caesar and rightfully believing she was also poisoning her daughter for the same reason, she kills Livilla by locking her in her room until she starves to death. During the reign of Caligula she is so disgusted by the state of Rome that she commits suicide. She is a leading character in the novel by Lindsey Davis, The Course of Honour (1997), where she guides and advises Claudius and his supporters. In the 1968 ITV historical drama The Caesars, Antonia was indirectly mentioned by Tiberius (played by Andr√© Morell), who noted that Germanicus was a blood relative of Augustus on his mother's [Antonia] side. Colleen Dewhurst portrayed Antonia opposite Susan Sarandon as Livilla in the 1985 miniseries A.D.

The Society manages, promotes and protects the performance rights of theatrical, audiovisual or photographic works for their creators by collecting royalties and authorising performances. It's also one of the main lobbies against \\"droit d'auteur\\" (copyright) changes and to protect the activities of collective rights management societies. History The SACD was founded in 1829 by French dramatist and miscellaneous writer Charles-Guillaume √âtienne. The idea of society protecting the rights of the authors dates back to Beaumarchais, who founded his own organization in 1777. Current activities In 2006 the Society represented about 44,000 members in the performing arts and audiovisual sectors. The entire SACD repertoire currently comprises about 500,000 works, from the performing arts and the audiovisual sector. The SACD lobbies in favor of governmental action meant to discourage unauthorized use of copyrighted works over the Internet (DADVSI, HADOPI) and against proposals to establish a \\"global license\\", authorizing French Internet users to copy copyrighted works in exchange for a flat fee on the Internet subscription. In 2009, the SACD hosted a petition in favor of Roman Polanski, following his arrest for failure to appear in a California court for sentencing after pleading guilty to one count of statutory rape of a 13-year- old girl. The SACD gives a prize to one of the feature films competing at the Critics' Week sidebar of the Cannes Film Festival.

A torus with aspect ratio 3 as the product of a smaller (red) and a bigger (magenta) circle. In geometry, a torus (plural tori) is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution. If the axis of revolution is tangent to the circle, the surface is a horn torus. If the axis of revolution passes twice through the circle, the surface is a spindle torus. If the axis of revolution passes through the center of the circle, the surface is a degenerate torus, a sphere. If the revolved curve is not a circle, the surface is a related shape, a toroid. Real-world objects that approximate a torus of revolution include swim rings and inner tubes. Eyeglass lenses that combine spherical and cylindrical correction are toric lenses. A torus should not be confused with a solid torus, which is formed by rotating a disk, rather than a circle, around an axis. A solid torus is a torus plus the volume inside the torus. Real-world objects that approximate a solid torus include O-rings, non- inflatable lifebuoys, ring doughnuts, and bagels. In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of two circles: S1 √ó S1, and the latter is taken to be the definition in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus is one way to embed this space into Euclidean space, but another way to do this is the Cartesian product of the embedding of S1 in the plane with itself. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space. In the field of topology, a torus is any topological space that is topologically equivalent to a torus. A coffee cup and a doughnut are both topological tori. An example of a torus can be constructed by taking a rectangular strip of flexible material, for example, a rubber sheet, and joining the top edge to the bottom edge, and the left edge to the right edge, without any half-twists (compare M√∂bius strip). Geometry A torus can be defined parametrically by: :\\\\begin{align} x(\\\\theta, \\\\varphi) &= (R + r \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\cos{\\\\varphi}\\\\\\\\\\\\ y(\\\\theta, \\\\varphi) &= (R + r \\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\sin{\\\\varphi}\\\\\\\\\\\\ z(\\\\theta, \\\\varphi) &= r \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\end{align} where :, are angles which make a full circle, so that their values start and end at the same point, : is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, : is the radius of the tube. is known as the \\"major radius\\" and is known as the \\"minor radius\\". The ratio divided by is known as the \\"aspect ratio\\". The typical doughnut confectionery has an aspect ratio of about 3 to 2. An implicit equation in Cartesian coordinates for a torus radially symmetric about the -axis is :\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} -R\\\\right)^2 + z^2 = r^2, or the solution of , where :f(x,y,z) = \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}-R\\\\right)^2 + z^2 - r^2. Algebraically eliminating the square root gives a quartic equation, :\\\\left(x^2+y^2+z^2 + R^2 - r^2\\\\right)^2 = 4R^2\\\\left(x^2+y^2\\\\right). The three classes of standard tori correspond to the three possible aspect ratios between and : *When , the surface will be the familiar ring torus or anchor ring. * corresponds to the horn torus, which in effect is a torus with no \\"hole\\". * describes the self-intersecting spindle torus. *When , the torus degenerates to the sphere. When , the interior :\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}-R\\\\right)^2 + z^2 < r^2 of this torus is diffeomorphic (and, hence, homeomorphic) to a product of a Euclidean open disk and a circle. The volume of this solid torus and the surface area of its torus are easily computed using Pappus's centroid theorem, giving: :\\\\begin{align} A &= \\\\left( 2\\\\pi r \\\\right) \\\\left(2 \\\\pi R \\\\right) = 4 \\\\pi^2 R r \\\\\\\\\\\\ V &= \\\\left ( \\\\pi r ^2 \\\\right ) \\\\left( 2 \\\\pi R \\\\right) = 2 \\\\pi^2 R r^2. \\\\end{align} These formulas are the same as for a cylinder of length and radius , obtained from cutting the tube along the plane of a small circle, and unrolling it by straightening out (rectifying) the line running around the center of the tube. The losses in surface area and volume on the inner side of the tube exactly cancel out the gains on the outer side. Expressing the surface area and the volume by the distance of an outermost point on the surface of the torus to the center, and the distance of an innermost point (so that and ), yields :\\\\begin{align} A &= 4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{p+q}{2}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{p-q}{2}\\\\right) = \\\\pi^2 (p+q) (p-q) \\\\\\\\\\\\ V &= 2 \\\\pi^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{p+q}{2}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{p-q}{2}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\pi^2 (p+q) (p-q)^2 \\\\end{align} Poloidal direction (red arrow) and Toroidal direction (blue arrow) As a torus is the product of two circles, a modified version of the spherical coordinate system is sometimes used. In traditional spherical coordinates there are three measures, , the distance from the center of the coordinate system, and and , angles measured from the center point. As a torus has, effectively, two center points, the centerpoints of the angles are moved; measures the same angle as it does in the spherical system, but is known as the \\"toroidal\\" direction. The center point of is moved to the center of , and is known as the \\"poloidal\\" direction. These terms were first used in a discussion of the Earth's magnetic field, where \\"poloidal\\" was used to denote \\"the direction toward the poles\\". In modern use, toroidal and poloidal are more commonly used to discuss magnetic confinement fusion devices. Topology Topologically, a torus is a closed surface defined as the product of two circles: S1 √ó S1. This can be viewed as lying in C2 and is a subset of the 3-sphere S3 of radius . This topological torus is also often called the Clifford torus. In fact, S3 is filled out by a family of nested tori in this manner (with two degenerate circles), a fact which is important in the study of S3 as a fiber bundle over S2 (the Hopf bundle). The surface described above, given the relative topology from R3, is homeomorphic to a topological torus as long as it does not intersect its own axis. A particular homeomorphism is given by stereographically projecting the topological torus into R3 from the north pole of S3. The torus can also be described as a quotient of the Cartesian plane under the identifications :(x,y) \\\\sim (x+1,y) \\\\sim (x,y+1), \\\\, or, equivalently, as the quotient of the unit square by pasting the opposite edges together, described as a fundamental polygon ABA‚àí1B‚àí1. Turning a punctured torus inside-out The fundamental group of the torus is just the direct product of the fundamental group of the circle with itself: :\\\\pi_1(\\\\mathbf{T}^2) = \\\\pi_1(S^1) \\\\times \\\\pi_1(S^1) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{Z}. Intuitively speaking, this means that a closed path that circles the torus' \\"hole\\" (say, a circle that traces out a particular latitude) and then circles the torus' \\"body\\" (say, a circle that traces out a particular longitude) can be deformed to a path that circles the body and then the hole. So, strictly 'latitudinal' and strictly 'longitudinal' paths commute. An equivalent statement may be imagined as two shoelaces passing through each other, then unwinding, then rewinding. If a torus is punctured and turned inside out then another torus results, with lines of latitude and longitude interchanged. This is equivalent to building a torus from a cylinder, by joining the circular ends together, in two ways: around the outside like joining two ends of a garden hose, or through the inside like rolling a sock (with the toe cut off). Additionally, if the cylinder was made by gluing two opposite sides of a rectangle together, choosing the other two sides instead will cause the same reversal of orientation. The first homology group of the torus is isomorphic to the fundamental group (this follows from Hurewicz theorem since the fundamental group is abelian). Two-sheeted cover The 2-torus double-covers the 2-sphere, with four ramification points. Every conformal structure on the 2-torus can be represented as a two-sheeted cover of the 2-sphere. The points on the torus corresponding to the ramification points are the Weierstrass points. In fact, the conformal type of the torus is determined by the cross-ratio of the four points. n-dimensional torus A stereographic projection of a Clifford torus in four dimensions performing a simple rotation through the xz-plane The torus has a generalization to higher dimensions, the n-dimensional torus, often called the n-torus or hypertorus for short. (This is one of two meanings of the term \\"n-torus\\".) Recalling that the torus is the product space of two circles, the n-dimensional torus is the product of n circles. That is: :\\\\mathbf{T}^n = \\\\underbrace{S^1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times S^1}_n. The 1-torus is just the circle: T1 = S1. The torus discussed above is the 2-torus, T2. And similar to the 2-torus, the n-torus, Tn can be described as a quotient of Rn under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the n-torus is Rn modulo the action of the integer lattice Zn (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the n-torus is obtained from the n-dimensional hypercube by gluing the opposite faces together. An n-torus in this sense is an example of an n-dimensional compact manifold. It is also an example of a compact abelian Lie group. This follows from the fact that the unit circle is a compact abelian Lie group (when identified with the unit complex numbers with multiplication). Group multiplication on the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication. Toroidal groups play an important part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This is due in part to the fact that in any compact Lie group G one can always find a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori T have a controlling role to play in theory of connected G. Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds. Automorphisms of T are easily constructed from automorphisms of the lattice Zn, which are classified by invertible integral matrices of size n with an integral inverse; these are just the integral matrices with determinant ¬±1. Making them act on Rn in the usual way, one has the typical toral automorphism on the quotient. The fundamental group of an n-torus is a free abelian group of rank n. The k-th homology group of an n-torus is a free abelian group of rank n choose k. It follows that the Euler characteristic of the n-torus is 0 for all n. The cohomology ring H‚Ä¢(Tn, Z) can be identified with the exterior algebra over the Z-module Zn whose generators are the duals of the n nontrivial cycles. =Configuration space= The configuration space of 2 not necessarily distinct points on the circle is the orbifold quotient of the 2-torus, T2/S2, which is the M√∂bius strip. The Tonnetz is an example of a torus in music theory. The Tonnetz is only truly a torus if enharmonic equivalence is assumed, so that the segment of the right edge of the repeated parallelogram is identified with the segment of the left edge. As the n-torus is the n-fold product of the circle, the n-torus is the configuration space of n ordered, not necessarily distinct points on the circle. Symbolically, Tn = (S1)n. The configuration space of unordered, not necessarily distinct points is accordingly the orbifold Tn/Sn, which is the quotient of the torus by the symmetric group on n letters (by permuting the coordinates). For n = 2, the quotient is the M√∂bius strip, the edge corresponding to the orbifold points where the two coordinates coincide. For n = 3 this quotient may be described as a solid torus with cross-section an equilateral triangle, with a twist; equivalently, as a triangular prism whose top and bottom faces are connected with a 1/3 twist (120¬∞): the 3-dimensional interior corresponds to the points on the 3-torus where all 3 coordinates are distinct, the 2-dimensional face corresponds to points with 2 coordinates equal and the 3rd different, while the 1-dimensional edge corresponds to points with all 3 coordinates identical. These orbifolds have found significant applications to music theory in the work of Dmitri Tymoczko and collaborators (Felipe Posada, Michael Kolinas, et al.), being used to model musical triads.Tony Phillips, Tony Phillips' Take on Math in the Media , American Mathematical Society, October 2006 Flat torus { class=wikitable align=right width=480 240px In three dimensions, one can bend a rectangle into a torus, but doing this typically stretches the surface, as seen by the distortion of the checkered pattern. 240px Seen in stereographic projection, a 4D flat torus can be projected into 3-dimensions and rotated on a fixed axis. } {4,4}1,0, constructed on the surface of a duocylinder with 1 vertex, 2 orthogonal edges, and one square face. It is seen here stereographically projected into 3-space as a torus. The flat torus is a torus with the metric inherited from its representation as the quotient, R2/L, where L is a discrete subgroup of R2 isomorphic to Z2. This gives the quotient the structure of a Riemannian manifold. Perhaps the simplest example of this is when : R2/Z2, which can also be described as the Cartesian plane under the identifications . This particular flat torus (and any uniformly scaled version of it) is known as the \\"square\\" flat torus. This metric of the square flat torus can also be realised by specific embeddings of the familiar 2-torus into Euclidean 4-space or higher dimensions. Its surface has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. Its surface is \\"flat\\" in the same sense that the surface of a cylinder is \\"flat\\". In 3 dimensions one can bend a flat sheet of paper into a cylinder without stretching the paper, but you cannot then bend this cylinder into a torus without stretching the paper (unless you give up some regularity and differentiability conditions, see below). A simple 4-dimensional Euclidean embedding of a rectangular flat torus (more general than the square one) is as follows: :(x,y,z,w) = (R\\\\cos u, R\\\\sin u, P\\\\cos v, P\\\\sin v) where R and P are constants determining the aspect ratio. It is diffeomorphic to a regular torus but not isometric. It can not be analytically embedded (smooth of class ) into Euclidean 3-space. Mapping it into 3-space requires you to stretch it, in which case it looks like a regular torus, for example, the following map :(x,y,z) = ((R+P\\\\sin v)\\\\cos u, (R+P\\\\sin v)\\\\sin u, P\\\\cos v). If R and P in the above flat torus form a unit vector then u, v, and Œ∑ can be used to parameterize the unit 3-sphere in a parameterization associated with the Hopf map. In particular, for certain very specific choices of a square flat torus in the 3-sphere S3, where above, the torus will partition the 3-sphere into two congruent solid tori subsets with the aforesaid flat torus surface as their common boundary. One example is the torus T defined by :T = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x,y,z,w) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{S}^3 \\\\mid x^2+y^2 = \\\\frac 1 2, \\\\ z^2+w^2 = \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Other tori in S3 having this partitioning property include the square tori of the form Q‚ãÖT, where Q is a rotation of 4-dimensional space R4, or in other words Q is a member of the Lie group SO(4). It is known that there exists no C2 (twice continuously differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-space. (The idea of the proof is to take a large sphere containing such a flat torus in its interior, and shrink the radius of the sphere until it just touches the torus for the first time. Such a point of contact must be a tangency. But that would imply that part of the torus, since it has zero curvature everywhere, must lie strictly outside the sphere, which is a contradiction.) On the other hand, according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, proven in the 1950s, an isometric C1 embedding exists. This is solely an existence proof, and does not provide explicit equations for such an embedding. In April 2012, an explicit C1 (continuously differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3 was found. It is similar in structure to a fractal as it is constructed by repeatedly corrugating an ordinary torus. Like fractals, it has no defined Gaussian curvature. However, unlike fractals, it does have defined surface normals. It \\"is\\" a flat torus in the sense that as metric spaces, it is isometric to a flat square torus. (These infinitely recursive corrugations are used only for embedding into three dimensions; they are not an intrinsic feature of the flat torus.) This is the first time that any such embedding was defined by explicit equations, or depicted by computer graphics. Genus g surface In the theory of surfaces there is another object, the \\"genus\\" g surface. Instead of the product of n circles, a genus g surface is the connected sum of g two-tori. To form a connected sum of two surfaces, remove from each the interior of a disk and \\"glue\\" the surfaces together along the boundary circles. To form the connected sum of more than two surfaces, sum two of them at a time until they are all connected. In this sense, a genus g surface resembles the surface of g doughnuts stuck together side by side, or a 2-sphere with g handles attached. As examples, a genus zero surface (without boundary) is the two-sphere while a genus one surface (without boundary) is the ordinary torus. The surfaces of higher genus are sometimes called n-holed tori (or, rarely, n-fold tori). The terms double torus and triple torus are also occasionally used. The classification theorem for surfaces states that every compact connected surface is topologically equivalent to either the sphere or the connect sum of some number of tori, disks, and real projective planes. { class=wikitable - align=center 160px genus two 240px genus three } Toroidal polyhedra A toroidal polyhedron with 6 √ó 4 = 24 quadrilateral faces Polyhedra with the topological type of a torus are called toroidal polyhedra, and have Euler characteristic V ‚àí E + F = 0. For any number of holes, the formula generalizes to V ‚àí E + F = 2 ‚àí 2N, where N is the number of holes. The term \\"toroidal polyhedron\\" is also used for higher-genus polyhedra and for immersions of toroidal polyhedra. Automorphisms The homeomorphism group (or the subgroup of diffeomorphisms) of the torus is studied in geometric topology. Its mapping class group ( the connected components of the homeomorphism group) is isomorphic to the group GL(n, Z) of invertible integer matrices, and can be realized as linear maps on the universal covering space Rn that preserve the standard lattice Zn (this corresponds to integer coefficients) and thus descend to the quotient. At the level of homotopy and homology, the mapping class group can be identified as the action on the first homology (or equivalently, first cohomology, or on the fundamental group, as these are all naturally isomorphic; also the first cohomology group generates the cohomology algebra: :\\\\operatorname{MCG}(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) = \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\pi_1(X)) = \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\mathbf{Z}^n) = \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbf{Z}). Since the torus is an Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space K(G, 1), its homotopy equivalences, up to homotopy, can be identified with automorphisms of the fundamental group); that this agrees with the mapping class group reflects that all homotopy equivalences can be realized by homeomorphisms ‚Äì every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a homeomorphism ‚Äì and that homotopic homeomorphisms are in fact isotopic (connected through homeomorphisms, not just through homotopy equivalences). More tersely, the map Homeo(Tn) ‚Üí SHE(Tn) is 1-connected (isomorphic on path-components, onto fundamental group). This is a \\"homeomorphism reduces to homotopy reduces to algebra\\" result. Thus the short exact sequence of the mapping class group splits (an identification of the torus as the quotient of Rn gives a splitting, via the linear maps, as above): :1 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Homeo}_0(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Homeo}(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{MCG}(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) \\\\to 1, so the homeomorphism group of the torus is a semidirect product, :\\\\operatorname{Homeo}(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Homeo}_0(\\\\mathbf{T}^n) \\\\rtimes \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbf{Z}). The mapping class group of higher genus surfaces is much more complicated, and an area of active research. Coloring a torus The torus's Heawood number is seven, meaning every graph that can be embedded on the torus has a chromatic number of at most seven. (Since the complete graph \\\\mathsf{K_7} can be embedded on the torus, and \\\\chi (\\\\mathsf{K_7}) = 7, the upper bound is tight.) Equivalently, in a torus divided into regions, it is always possible to color the regions using no more than seven colors so that no neighboring regions are the same color. (Contrast with the four color theorem for the plane.) This construction shows the torus divided into seven regions, every one of which touches every other, meaning each must be assigned a unique color. Cutting a torus A solid torus of revolution can be cut by n (> 0) planes into maximally :\\\\begin{pmatrix}n+2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ n-1\\\\end{pmatrix} +\\\\begin{pmatrix}n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n-1\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\tfrac{1}{6}(n^3 + 3n^2 + 8n) parts. The first 11 numbers of parts, for 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10 (including the case of n = 0, not covered by the above formulas), are as follows: :1, 2, 6, 13, 24, 40, 62, 91, 128, 174, 230, ... .

The doughnut is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of shapes without a hole, and often filled, but can also be ball-shaped (\\"doughnut holes\\"). Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors. The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or fruit. Other shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen type doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee purchased at doughnut shops, convenience stores, petrol stations, cafes or fast food restaurants, but can also be paired with milk. Shapes =Rings= Ring doughnuts are formed by one of two methods: by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring, or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (from the dough removed from the center). This smaller piece of dough can be cooked and served as a \\"doughnut hole\\" or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts. A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole. Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer. There are two types of ring doughnuts, those made from a yeast-based dough for raised doughnuts, or those made from a special type of cake batter. Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25% oil by weight, whereas cake doughnuts' oil content is around 20%, but they have extra fat included in the batter before frying. Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately , turning once. Yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry, about 150 seconds, at . Cake doughnuts typically weigh between , whereas yeast- raised doughnuts average and are generally larger, and taller (due to rising) when finished. Topping The process of glazing doughnuts After frying, ring doughnuts are often topped. Raised doughnuts are generally covered with a glaze (icing). Cake doughnuts can also be glazed, or powdered with confectioner's sugar, or covered with cinnamon and granulated sugar. They are also often topped with cake frosting (top-side only) and sometimes sprinkled with coconut, chopped peanuts, or sprinkles (also called jimmies). =Holes= Tim Hortons \\"Timbits\\" doughnut holes Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts. Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market \\"holes\\" as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as \\"Munchkins\\" from Dunkin' Donuts and \\"Timbits\\" from Tim Hortons. Traditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut. Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical. Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar. Originally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts. However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter. This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, fritters and Dutchies. =Filled= Filled doughnuts are flattened spheres injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings, and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting. Common varieties include the Boston cream, coconut, key lime, and jelly. =Other shapes= Others include the fritter and the Dutchie, which are usually glazed. These have been available on Tim Hortons' doughnut menu since the chain's inception in 1964, and a 1991 Toronto Star report found these two were the chain's most popular type of fried dough in Canada. There are many other specialized doughnut shapes such as old- fashioned, bars or Long Johns (a rectangular shape), or with the dough twisted around itself before cooking. In the northeast United States, bars and twists are usually referred to as crullers. Another is the beignet, a square-shaped doughnut covered with powdered sugar, commonly associated with New Orleans. History =Origins= Glazed doughnuts rolling on a conveyor belt at a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop Pink Christmas doughnuts The earliest origins to the modern doughnuts are generally traced back to the olykoek (\\"oil(y) cake\\") Dutch settlers brought with them to early New York (or New Amsterdam). These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current ring shape.The History of Doughnuts, The Spruce One of the earliest mentions of \\"doughnut\\" was in Washington Irving's 1809 book A History of New York, from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty:Doughnut Or Donut?

The name oly koeks was almost certainly related to the oliekoek: a Dutch delicacy of \\"sweetened cake fried in fat.\\"See entries for oliebol and oliekoek in According to anthropologist Paul R. Mullins, the first cookbook mentioning doughnuts was an 1803 English volume which included doughnuts in an appendix of American recipes. He also traces its origins to the oliekoek that arrived in America with the Dutch settlers in the early 18th century. By the mid-19th century, the doughnut looked and tasted like today's doughnut, and was viewed as a thoroughly American food. Hanson Gregory, an American, claimed to have invented the ring-shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime-trading ship when he was 16 years old. Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts. He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship's tin pepper box, and to have later taught the technique to his mother.\\"'Old Salt' Doughnut hole inventor tells just how discovery was made and stomachs of earth saved.\\" Special to The Washington Post; The Washington Post (1877‚Äì1954), Washington, D.C; March 26, 1916; p. ES9 Smithsonian Magazine states that his mother, Elizabeth Gregory, \\"made a deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son's spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind,\\" and \\"put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through\\", and called the food 'doughnuts'. Another theory on their origin came to light in 2013, when a recipe for \\"dow nuts\\" was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written around 1800 by the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale, the recipe being given to the dowager Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the cooking instructions for a \\"dow nut\\". =Etymology= \\"Dough nut\\" The earliest known recorded usage of the term dates to an 1808 short storyOriginals, Selections, &C.; for the Times.

Washington Irving's reference to \\"doughnuts\\" in 1809 in his History of New York is more commonly cited as the first written recording of the term. Irving described \\"balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called doughnuts, or olykoeks.\\" These \\"nuts\\" of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes (see holes section). The word nut is here used in the earlier sense of \\"small rounded cake or cookie\\", also seen in ginger nut.doughnut in the American Heritage Dictionary Doughnut is the traditional spelling and still dominates even in the United States though donut is often used.Norbert Schmitt and Richard Marsden (2006) Why is English like that?: historical answers to hard ELT questions, University of Michigan Press, , p. 166: \\"... and British English in the spelling of individual words include ax/axe (though the British form is also frequently used in America), check/ cheque (a money order), donut/doughnut, draft/draught (an air current), mold/mould,...\\"Richard Ellis (2003) Communication skills: stepladders to success for the professional, Intellect Books, , p. 113 \\"... US spelling is influencing users to spell programme as program, center for centre and donut for doughnut.\\" At present, doughnut and the shortened form donut are both pervasive in American English.Janet Sue Terry (2005) A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying Collection of Breakfast Recipes, Just My Best Publishing Company, , p. 233 \\"At present, \\"donut\\" and \\"doughnut\\" are both pervasive in American English, but only \\"doughnut\\" is listed in Thorndike and Lorge's (1942) The Teacher's Word Book of 30,000 Words. There are sparse instances of the \\"donut\\" spelling variation prior to WWII. For instance, it is mentioned in an LA Times article dated August 10, 1929. There, Bailey Millard complains about the decline of spelling, and that he \\"can't swallow the 'wel-dun donut' nor the everso'gud bred'.\\" \\" \\"Donut\\" The first known printed use of donut was in Peck's Bad Boy and his Pa by George W. Peck, published in 1900, in which a character is quoted as saying, \\"Pa said he guessed he hadn't got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.\\" According to John T. Edge (Donuts, an American passion 2006) the alternative spelling \\"donut\\" was invented when the New York‚Äìbased Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment.John T. Edge (2006) Donuts: an American passion, Penguin Group US, : \\"Donuts\\" came to the fore in the 1920s, when the New York-based Doughnut Machine Corporation set its eyes upon foreign markets. \\"In order to obviate difficulty in pronouncing 'doughnuts' in foreign languages,\\" a press release announced ..\\"Michael Klebeck, Scott Pitts (2011) Top Pot Hand-Forged Doughnuts: Secrets and Recipes for the Home Baker, Chronicle Books, , p. 16: \\"According to Edge, the alternative spelling \\"donut\\" was invented when the New York‚Äìbased Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment.\\" The donut spelling also showed up in a Los Angeles Times article dated August 10, 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about the decline of spelling, and that he \\"can't swallow the 'wel-dun donut' nor the ever so 'gud bred'.\\" The interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of \\"National Donut Week\\" articles in The New York Times that covered the 1939 World's Fair. In four articles beginning October 9, two mention the donut spelling. Dunkin' Donuts, which was so-named in 1950, following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle (Quincy, Massachusetts), is the oldest surviving company to use the donut variation; other chains, such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation (1931), did not use that spelling.Sally L.

According to the Oxford Dictionaries while \\"doughnut\\" is used internationally, the spelling \\"donut\\" is American. doughnut. Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) \\"The beginning of doughnut is spelled dough- (the spelling donut is American).\\" The spelling \\"donut\\" remained rare until the 1950s, and has since grown significantly in popularity;\\"donut, doughnut\\", Google Ngram viewer this growth in use has possibly been influenced by the spread of Dunkin' Donuts.The Language Time Machine: Google's Ngram Viewer gave us a new way to explore history, but has it led to any real discoveries?, by Elizabeth Weingarten, Slate, September 9, 2013 =National Doughnut Day= National Doughnut Day, also known as National Donut Day, celebrated in the United States of America, is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by The Salvation Army in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France. Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an \\"instant hit\\", and \\"soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts\\". Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: \\"Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee.\\" Soon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as \\"Doughnut Dollies\\". =Pink boxes= In the US, especially in Southern California, fresh doughnuts sold by the dozen at local doughnut shops are typically packaged in generic pink boxes. This phenomenon can be attributed to Ted Ngoy and Ning Yen, refugees of the Cambodian genocide who transformed the local doughnut shop industry. They proved so adept at the business and in training fellow Chinese Cambodian refugees to follow suit that these local doughnut shops soon dominated native franchises such as Winchell's Donuts. Initially desiring boxes of a lucky red color rather than the standard white, Ngoy and Yen settled on a cheaper, leftover pink stock. Owing to the success of their business, the color soon became a recognizable standard. Due to the locality of Hollywood, the pink boxes frequently appeared as film and television props and were thus transmitted into popular culture.  Science  = Cake vs yeast style = Yeast doughnuts and cake doughnuts contain most of the same ingredients, however, their structural differences arise from the type of flour and leavening agent used. In cake doughnuts, cake flour is used, and the resulting doughnut is denser because cake flour has a relatively low gluten content of about 7 to 8 percent.Masibay, Kimberly Y. \\"Taking Control of Gluten.\\" Fine Cooking. N.p., 2016. Web. 30 Nov. 2016. In yeast doughnuts, a flour with a higher protein content of about 9 to 12 percent is used, resulting in a doughnut that is lighter and more airy. In addition, yeast doughnuts utilize yeast as a leavening agent. Specifically, \\"Yeast cells are thoroughly distributed throughout the dough and begin to feed on the sugar that is present ... carbon dioxide gas is generated, which raises the dough, making it light and porous.\\" Whereas this process is biological, the leavening process in cake doughnuts is chemical. In cake doughnuts, the most common leavening agent is baking powder. Baking powder is essentially \\"baking soda with acid added. This neutralizes the base and produces more CO2 according to the following equation: NaHCO3 \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí Na+ \\\\+ H2O + CO2.\\" = Physical structure = The physical structure of the doughnut is created by the combination of flour, leavening agent, sugar, eggs, salt, water, shortening, milk solids, and additional components. The most important ingredients for creating the dough network are the flour and eggs. The main protein in flour is gluten, which is overall responsible for creating elastic dough because this protein acts as \\"coiled springs.\\"Pyler, E. J. Baking Science and Technology. Chicago: Siebel, 1952. Print. The gluten network is composed of two separate molecules named glutenin and gliadin. Specifically, \\"the backbone of the gluten network likely consists of the largest glutenin molecules, or subunits, aligned and tightly linked to one another. These tightly linked glutenin subunits associate more loosely, along with gliadin, into larger gluten aggregates.\\"Figoni, Paula. How Baking Works. 2nd ed. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2008. Print. The gluten strands than tangle and interact with other strands and other molecules, resulting in networks that provide the elasticity of the dough. In mixing, the gluten is developed when the force of the mixer draws the gluten from the wheat endosperm, allowing the gluten matrix to trap the gas cells. = Molecular composition = A diagram of a phospholipid molecule, which is responsible for the emulsifying properties of lecithin in egg yolk. Eggs function as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough. The egg white proteins, mainly ovalbumin, \\"function as structure formers. Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids combined with the moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.\\" The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. \\"The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.\\" The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute to the structure of the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas. An animated sucrose molecule, which is a disaccharide, responsible for the sweetness of a doughnut. Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, \\"a typical shortening that appears solid [at room temperature] contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil ... this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).\\" This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins. If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the gluten network. Water is a necessary ingredient in the production of doughnuts because it activates the other ingredients, allowing them to perform their functions in building the doughnut's structure. For example, sugar and salt crystals must be dissolved in order for them to act in the dough, whereas larger molecules, such as the starches or proteins, must be hydrated in order for them to absorb moisture. Another important consideration of water is its degree of hardness, which measures the amount of impurities in the water source. Pure water consists of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, but water used in baking often is not pure. Baker's salt (NaCl) is usually used as an ingredient due to its high purity, whereas the salts in water are derived from varying minerals. As an ingredient, \\"salt is added to enhance the flavour of cakes and breads and to ‚Äòtoughen up‚Äô the soft mixture of fat and sugar.\\" If relatively soft water is being used, more salt should be added in order to strengthen the gluten network of the dough, but if not enough salt is added during the baking process, the flavor of the bread will not be appealing to consumers. =Health effects= Doughnuts are unhealthy,Maffetone, Philip.The Big Book of Health and Fitness: A Practical Guide to Diet, Exercise, Healthy Aging, Illness Prevention, and Sexual Well- Being, p. 187 (Skyhorse Publishing, 2012). though some are less so than others. According to Prevention Magazine, doughnuts made from enriched flour provide some thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin, along with some fiber, but they are high in sugar and calories.Bricklin, Mark. Prevention Magazine's Nutrition Advisor: The Ultimate Guide to the Health-Boosting and Health-Harming Factors in Your Diet, p. 169 (Rodale, 1994). Steps to improve the healthiness of doughnuts include removing trans fats. = Dough rheology = An important property of the dough that affects the final product is the dough's rheology. This property measures the ability of the dough to flow. It can be represented by the power law equation: œÑ=k.D^n where œÑ is the tangentic stress, k is the viscosity coefficient, D is the shear rate, and n is the flow index. Many factors affect dough rheology including the type of ingredients, the amount of the ingredients, or the force applied during mixing. Dough is usually described as a viscoelastic material, meaning that its rheology depends on both the viscosity and the elasticity. The viscosity coefficient and the flow index are unique to the type of dough being analyzed, while the tangentic stress and the shear rate are measurements obtained depending on the type force being applied to the dough. Regional variations =Africa= South Africa In South Africa, an Afrikaans variation known as the koeksister is popular. Another variation, similar in name, is the Cape Malay koesister being soaked in a spiced syrup and coated in coconut. It has a texture similar to more traditional doughnuts as opposed to the Afrikaans variety. A further variation is the vetkoek, which is also dough deep fried in oil. It is served with mince, syrup, honey or jam. Tunisia In Tunisia, traditional pastries similar to doughnuts are yo-yos. They come in different versions both as balls and in shape of doughnuts. They are deep-fried and covered in a honey syrup or a kind of frosting. Sesame seeds are also used for flavor and decoration along with orange juice and vanilla. Morocco In Morocco, Sfenj is a similar pastry eaten sprinkled with sugar or soaked in honey. =Asia= China A few sweet, doughnut-style pastries are regional in nature. Cantonese cuisine features an oval-shaped pastry called ng√†uhleis≈çu (ÁâõËÑ∑ÈÖ•, lit. \\"ox-tongue pastry\\", due to its tongue-like shape). A spherical food called saa1 jung (Ê≤ôÁøÅ), which is also similar to a cream puff but denser with a doughnut-like texture and usually prepared with sugar sprinkled on top, is normally available in dim sum Cantonese restaurants. An oilier Beijing variant of this called È´òÂäõË±ÜÊ≤ô, gaoli dousha, is filled with red bean paste; originally, it was made with egg white instead of dough. Many Chinese cultures make a chewy doughnut known as shuangbaotai (ÈõôÂåÖËÉé), which consists of two conjoined balls of dough. Chinese restaurants in the United States sometimes serve small fried pastries similar to doughnut holes with condensed milk as a sauce. Chinese cuisine features long, deep-fried doughnut sticks that are often quite oily, hence their name in Mandarin, y√≥uti√°o (Ê≤πÊ¢ù, \\"oil strips\\"); in Cantonese, this doughnut-style pastry is called y√†uhjagw√°i (Ê≤πÁÇ∏È¨º, \\"ghosts fried in oil\\"). These pastries are not sweet and are often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge or soy milk. India In India, an old-fashioned sweet called gulgula is made of sweetened, deep-fried flour balls. A leavening agent may or may not be used. Balushahi from India. In India, there are a couple of unrelated doughnut-shaped food items. A savory, fried, ring-shaped snack called a vada is often referred to as the Indian doughnut. The vada is made from dal, lentil or potato flours rather than wheat flour. In North India, it is in the form of a bulging disc called dahi-vada, and is soaked in curd, sprinkled with spices and sliced vegetables, and topped with a sweet and sour chutney. In South India, a vada is eaten with sambar and a coconut chutney. Sweet pastries similar to old-fashioned doughnuts called badushahi and jalebi are also popular. Balushahi, also called badushah, is made from flour, deep fried in clarified butter, and dipped in sugar syrup. Unlike a doughnut, balushahi is dense. A balushahi is ring- shaped, but the well in the center does not go all the way through to form a hole typical of a doughnut. Jalebi, which is typically pretzel-shaped, is made by deep frying batter in oil and soaking it in sugar syrup. A variant of jalebi, called imarti, is shaped with a small ring in the center around which a geometric pattern is arranged. Along with these Indian variants, typical varieties of doughnuts are also available from U.S. chains such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts retail outlets, as well as local brands such as Mad Over Donuts and the Donut Baker. Indonesia The Indonesian, donat kentang is a potato doughnut, a ring-shaped fritter made from flour and mashed potatoes, coated in powder sugar or icing sugar. Iran Zoolbia and bamiyeh The Persian zoolbia and bamiyeh are fritters of various shapes and sizes coated in a sugar syrup. Doughnuts are also made in the home in Iran, referred to as doughnut, even in the plural. Israel sufganiyot in a wide variety of toppings at a bakery in Tel Aviv, Israel Jelly doughnuts, known as sufganiyah (◊°◊ï◊§◊í◊†◊ô◊î, pl. sufganiyot ◊°◊ï◊§◊í◊†◊ô◊ï◊™) in Israel, have become a traditional Hanukkah food in the recent era, as they are cooked in oil, associated with the holiday account of the miracle of the oil. Traditional sufganiyot are filled with red jelly and topped with icing sugar. However, many other varieties exist, with some being filled with dulce de leche (particularly common after the South American aliyah early in the 21st century). Japan An-doughnut filled with red bean paste from Japan In Japan, an-doughnut („ÅÇ„Çì„Éâ„Éº„Éä„ÉÉ„ÉÑ, \\"bean paste doughnut\\") is widely available at bakeries. An-doughnut is similar to Germany's Berliner, except it contains red azuki bean paste. Mister Donut is one of the most popular doughnut chains in Japan. Native to Okinawa is a spheroid pastry similar to doughnuts called sata andagi. Malaysia Kuih keria is a hole doughnut made from boiled sweet potato that is mashed. The sweet potato mash is shaped into rings and fried. The hot doughnut is then rolled in granulated sugar. The result is a doughnut with a sugar-crusted skin. Nepal Sel roti is a Nepali homemade, ring- shaped, rice doughnut prepared during Tihar, the widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. A semiliquid dough is usually prepared by adding milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, and mashed banana to rice flour, which is often left to ferment for up to 24 hours. A sel roti is traditionally fried in ghee. Pakistan Doughnuts are available at most bakeries across Pakistan. The Navaz Sharif variety, available mainly in the city of Karachi, is covered in chocolate and filled with cream, similar to a Boston cream. Doughnuts can readily be found at the many Dunkin' Donuts branches spread across Pakistan. Philippines Bu√±uelos with ube filling from the Philippines The distinctively-shaped shakoy (also known as lubid-lubid), a doughnut variant from the Visayas, Philippines Local varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner's) sugar. Round versions of this doughnut are known as bu√±uelos (also spelled bunwelos, and sometimes confusingly known as \\"bicho-bicho\\"), similar to the doughnuts in Spain and former Spanish colonies. Indigenous versions of the doughnut also exist, like the cascaron, which is prepared similarly, but uses ground glutinous rice and coconut milk in place of wheat flour and milk. Other native doughnut recipes include the shakoy, kumukunsi, and binangkal. Shakoy or siyakoy from the Visayas islands (also known as lubid-lubid in the northern Philippines) uses a length of dough twisted into a distinctive rope-like shape before being fried. The preparation is almost exactly the same as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour. The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy (in the latter case, they are known as pilipit). They are sprinkled with white sugar, but can also be topped with sesame seeds or caramelized sugar. Kumukunsi is a jalebi-like native doughnut from the Maguindanao people. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. It has the taste and consistency of a creamy pancake. Binangkal are simple fried dough balls covered in sesame seeds. Other fried dough desserts include the mesh-like lokot-lokot, the fried rice cake panyalam, and the banana fritter maruya, among others.> Taiwan In Taiwan, shuƒÅngbƒÅotƒÅi (ÈõôËÉûËÉé, lit. \\"twins\\") is two pieces of dough wrapped together before frying. Thailand In Thailand, a popular breakfast food is pa thong ko, also known as Thai donuts, a version of the Chinese yiu ja guoy/youtiao. Often sold from food stalls in markets or by the side of the road, these doughnuts are small, sometimes X-shaped, and sold by the bag full. They are often eaten in the morning with hot Thai tea. Vietnam Vietnamese varieties of doughnuts include b√°nh ti√™u, b√°nh cam, and b√°nh r√°n. B√°nh ti√™u is a sesame- topped, deep-fried pastry that is hallow. It can be eaten alone or cut in half and served with b√°nh b√≤, a gelatinous cake, placed inside the pastry. B√°nh cam is from Southern Vietnam and is a ball-shaped, deep-fried pastry coated entirely in sesame seeds and containing a mung bean paste filling. B√°nh r√°n is from Northern Vietnam and is similar to b√°nh cam; however, the difference is that b√°nh r√°n is covered with a sugar glaze after being deep-fried and its mung bean paste filling includes a jasmine essence. =Europe= Austria In Austria, doughnut equivalents are called Krapfen. They are especially popular during Carneval season (Fasching), and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid and usually filled with apricot jam (traditional) or vanilla cream (Vanillekrapfen). A second variant, called Bauernkrapfen, probably more similar to doughnuts, are made of yeast dough, and have a thick outside ring, but are very thin in the middle. Belgium In Belgium, the smoutebollen in Dutch, or croustillons in French, are similar to the Dutch kind of oliebollen, but they usually do not contain any fruit, except for apple chunks sometimes. They are typical carnival and fair snacks and are coated with powdered sugar. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia Czech koblihy Doughnuts similar to the Berliner are prepared in the northern Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia (pokladnice or krofne). They are also called krofna, krafna or krafne, a name derived from the Austrian Krapfen for this pastry. In Croatia, they are especially popular during Carneval season and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid. Traditionally, they are filled with jam (apricot or plum). However, they can be filled with vanilla or chocolate cream. Other types of doughnuts are u≈°tipci and fritule. Czech Republic U.S.-style doughnuts are available in the Czech Republic, but before they were solid shape and filled with jelly (strawberry or peach). The shape is similar to doughnuts in Germany or Poland. They are called Kobliha (Koblihy in plural). They may be filled with nougat or with vanilla custard. There are now many fillings; cut in half or non-filled knots with sugar and cinnamon on top. Denmark In Denmark, U.S.-style doughnuts may be found at various stores, e.g. McDonald's and most gas stations. The Berliner, however, is also available in bakeries. Finland A Finnish meat doughnut in Finland, a sweet doughnut is called a munkki (the word also means monk) and are commonly eaten in caf√©s and cafeteria restaurants. It is sold cold and sometimes filled with jam (like U.S. jelly donuts) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as donitsi. A savory form of doughnut is the meat doughnut (in Finnish lihapiirakka, or literally meat pie). Made from a doughnut mixture and deep fried, the end product is more akin to a savory doughnut than any pie known in the English-speaking world. France The French beignet, literally \\"bump\\", is the French and New Orleans equivalent of a doughnut: a pastry made from deep-fried choux pastry.Alan Davidson (1999) Oxford Companion to Food, Oxford University Press Germany German Berliner In parts of Germany, the doughnut equivalents are called Berliner (sg. and pl.), but not in the capital city of Berlin itself and neighboring areas, where they are called Pfannkuchen (which is often found misleading by people in the rest of Germany, who use the word Pfannkuchen to describe a pancake, which is also the literal translation of it). In middle Germany, doughnuts are called Kreppel or Pfannkuchen. In southern Germany, they are also called Krapfen and are especially popular during Carnival season (Karneval/Fasching) in southern and middle Germany and on New Year's Eve in northern Germany. A Berliner does not have the typical ring shape of a doughnut, but instead is solid and usually filled with jam, while a ring-shaped variant called Kameruner is common in Berlin and eastern Germany. Bismarcks and Berlin doughnuts are also found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and the United States. Today, U.S.-style doughnuts are also available in Germany, but are less popular than their native counterparts. Greece In Greece, a doughnut-like snack called loukoumas (ŒªŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒ¨œÇ), which is spherical and soaked in honey syrup, is available. It is often served with sprinkled cinnamon and grated walnuts or sesame seeds. Hungary F√°nk is a sweet traditional Hungarian cake. The most commonly used ingredients are flour, yeast, butter, egg yolk, rum, salt, milk and oil for frying. The dough is allowed to rise for approximately 30 minutes, resulting in an extremely light pastry. F√°nk is usually served with powdered sugar and lekvar. It is supposed that F√°nk pastry is of the same origin as German Berliner, Dutch oliebol, and Polish pƒÖczki. Italy An Italian Zeppole Italian doughnuts include ciambelle, krapfen, zippuli and zeppole from Calabria, maritozzi and bomboloni from Tuscany, and frittelle from Veneto. Lithuania In Lithuania, a kind of doughnut called spurgos is widely known. Some spurgos are similar to Polish pƒÖczki, but some specific recipes, such as cottage cheese doughnuts (var≈°kƒós spurgos), were invented independently. Netherlands Oliebollen: Dutch doughnuts In the Netherlands, oliebollen, referred to in cookbooks as \\"Dutch doughnuts\\", are a type of fritter, with or without raisins or currants, and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar. Variations of the recipe contain slices of apple or other fruits. They are traditionally eaten as part of New Year celebrations. Norway In Norway, smultring is the prevailing type of doughnut traditionally sold in bakeries, shops, and stalls. However, U.S.-style doughnuts are widely available in larger supermarkets, McDonald's restaurants, 7-elevens and bakeries. The Berliner is more common than U.S.-style doughnut, and sold in most supermarkets and bakeries alongside smultring doughnuts. Poland Polish pƒÖczki In Poland and parts of the U.S. with a large Polish community, like Chicago and Detroit, the round, jam-filled doughnuts eaten especially‚Äîthough not exclusively‚Äîduring the Carnival are called pƒÖczki (). PƒÖczki have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. Jƒôdrzej Kitowicz has described that during the reign of the Augustus III under influence of French cooks who came to Poland at that time, pƒÖczki dough fried in Poland has been improved, so that pƒÖczki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient. Portugal Romania The Romanian dessert gogo»ôi are fried dough balls similar to filled doughnuts. They are stuffed with chocolate, jam, cheese and other combinations and may be dusted with icing sugar. Russia Ukrainian pampushky filled with sour cherries In Russia and the other Post-Soviet countries, ponchiki (, plural form of –ø–æ–Ω—á–∏–∫, ponchik) or (, especially in St. Petersburg) are a very popular sweet doughnut, with many fast and simple recipes available in Russian cookbooks for making them at home as a breakfast or coffee pastry.Recipes for Russian and other ponchiki . Slovenia In Slovenia, a jam-filled doughnut known as krofi, is very popular. It is the typical sweet during Carnival time, but is to be found in most bakeries during the whole year. The most famous krofi come from the village of Trojane in central Slovenia, and are originally filled with apricot jam filling.Trojane doughnuts. Slovenia.info. Retrieved on August 22, 2013. Spain Fried \\"Rosquillas\\" from Asturias, Spain In Spain, there are two different types of doughnuts. The first one, simply called donuts, or more traditionally berlinesas, is a U.S.-style doughnut, i.e., a deep-fried, sweet, soft, ring of flour dough. The second type of doughnut is a traditional pastry called rosquilla, made of fermented dough and fried or baked in an oven. Rosaquillas were purportedly introduced in Spain by the Romans. In Spain, there are several variants of them depending on the region where they are prepared and the time of the year they are sold. In some regions they are considered a special pastry prepared only for Easter. Although overall they are more tightly textured and less sweet than U.S.-style doughnuts, they differ greatly in shape, size and taste from one region to another. The churro is a sweet pastry of deep-fried dough similar to a doughnut but shaped as a long, thin, ribbed cylinder rather than a ring or sphere. Churros are commonly served dusted in sugar as a snack or with a cup of hot chocolate. Switzerland In Switzerland, there are Zigerkrapfen, Berliner and tortelli di San Giuseppe. Sweden Similar to the Finnish munkki, the Swedish munk is a sweet doughnut commonly eaten as fika along with coffee. It is sold cold and is sometimes filled with jam (U.S. jelly) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as simply munk. Ukraine In Ukraine doughnuts are called pampushky (). Pampushky are made of yeast dough containing wheat, rye or buckwheat flour. Traditionally they are baked, but may also be fried. According to William Pokhlyobkin, the technology of making pampushky points to German cuisine, and these buns were possibly created by German colonists in Ukraine. United Kingdom Two shop-bought lightly glazed Yum Yums on a plate. On average they are in length. In some parts of Scotland, ring doughnuts are referred to as doughrings, with the 'doughnut' name being reserved exclusively for the nut-shaped variety. Glazed, twisted rope-shaped doughnuts are known as yum-yums. It is also possible to buy fudge doughnuts in certain regions of Scotland. Fillings include jam, custard, cream, sweet mincemeat, chocolate and apple. Common ring toppings are sprinkle-iced and chocolate. In Northern Ireland, ring doughnuts are known as gravy rings, gravy being an archaic term for hot cooking oil. =North America= Puntarenas' cream-filled doughnuts Caribbean region A kurma is a small, sweet, fried cube-shaped or rectangular doughnut which originated in Eastern India but is sold in Trinidad and Tobago. Costa Rica A traditional Puntarenas cream-filled doughnut is round and robust, managing to keep the cream inside liquified. They are popular in Costa Rica. Mexico The Mexican donas are similar to doughnuts, including the name; the dona is a fried-dough pastry-based snack, commonly covered with powdered brown sugar and cinnamon, white sugar or chocolate. United States and Canada Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts Powdered, glazed and chocolate doughnuts from a variety pack sold at supermarkets Donuts being sold Frosted, glazed, powdered, Boston cream, coconut, sour cream, cinnamon, chocolate, and jelly are some of the varieties eaten in the United States and Canada. Sweetening, filling, and fancy toppings are now so common that plain doughnuts are now commonly labeled and sold as \\"old fashioned\\". There are also potato doughnuts (sometimes referred to as spudnuts). Elegant doughnut served at a wedding breakfast in Miami Beach Doughnuts are ubiquitous in the United States and can be found in most grocery stores, as well as in specialty doughnut shops. A popular doughnut in Hawaii is the malasada. Malasadas were brought to the Hawaiian Islands by early Portuguese settlers, and are a variation on Portugal's filh√≥s. They are small eggy balls of yeast dough deep-fried and coated in sugar. Immigrants have brought various doughnut varieties to the United States. To celebrate Fat Tuesday in eastern Pennsylvania, churches sell a potato starch doughnut called a Fastnacht (or Fasnacht). The treats are so popular there that Fat Tuesday is often called Fastnacht Day. The Polish doughnut, the pƒÖczki, is popular in U.S. cities with large Polish communities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and Detroit. In regions of the country where apples are widely grown, especially the Northeast and Midwest states, cider doughnuts are a harvest season specialty, especially at orchards open to tourists, where they can be served fresh. Cider doughnuts are a cake doughnut with apple cider in the batter. The use of cider affects both the texture and flavor, resulting in a denser, moister product. They are often coated with either granulated or powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar. In Southern Louisiana, a popular variety of the doughnut is the beignet, a fried, square doughnut served traditionally with powdered sugar. Perhaps the most famous purveyor of beignets is New Orleans restaurant Cafe Du Monde. In Quebec, homemade doughnuts called beignes de No√´l are traditional Christmas desserts. Chocolate-frosted doughnut =Oceania= Australia Custard-filled doughnut served by Il Fornaio, St Kilda, Victoria, Australia In Australia, the doughnut is a popular snack food. Jam doughnuts are particularly popular and a unique aspect of Australian culture, especially in Melbourne, Victoria and the Queen Victoria Market, where they are a tradition.A hot piece of history. theage.com.au. February 5, 2004 Jam doughnuts are similar to a Berliner, but are served hot: red jam (raspberry or strawberry) is injected into the bun before it is deep-fried, and then it is coated with either sugar or sugar mixed with cinnamon as soon as it has been cooked. Jam doughnuts are sometimes also bought frozen. In South Australia, they are known as Berliner or Kitchener and often served in cafes. Popular variants include custard-filled doughnuts, and more recently Nutella-filled doughnuts. Mobile vans that serve doughnuts, traditional or jam, are often seen at spectator events, markets, carnivals and fetes, and by the roadside near high-traffic areas like airports and the carparks of large shopping centres. Traditional cinnamon doughnuts are readily available in Australia from specialised retailers and convenience stores. Doughnuts are a popular choice for schools and other not-for-profit groups to cook and sell as a fundraiser. New Zealand In New Zealand, the doughnut is a popular food snack available in corner dairies. They are in the form of a long sweet bread roll with a deep cut down its long axis. In this cut is placed a long dollop of sweetened clotted cream and on top of this is a spot of strawberry jam. Doughnuts are of two varieties: fresh cream or mock cream. The rounded variety is widely available as well. =South America= Brazil In Brazil, bakeries, grocery stores and pastry shops sell ball-shaped doughnuts popularly known as \\"sonhos\\" (lit. dreams). The dessert was brought to Brazil by Portuguese colonizers that had contact with Dutch and German traders. They are the equivalent of nowadays \\"bolas de Berlim\\" (lit. balls of Berlin) in Portugal, but the traditional Portuguese yellow cream was substituted by local dairy and fruit products. They are made of a special type of bread filled with \\"goiabada\\" (guava jelly) or milk cream, and covered by white sugar. Chile Berlin (plural Berlines) doughnut is popular in Chile because of the large German community. It may be filled with jam or with manjar, the Chilean version of dulce de leche.

National Doughnut Day celebrates the doughnut's history and role in popular culture. There is a race in Staunton, Illinois, featuring doughnuts, called Tour de Donut. In film, the doughnut has inspired Dora's Dunking Doughnuts (1933), The Doughnuts (1963) and Tour de Donut: Gluttons for Punishment. In video games, the doughnut has appeared in games like The Simpsons Game and Donut Dilemma. In the cartoon Mucha Lucha, there are four things that make up the code of mask wrestling: honor, family, tradition, and doughnuts. Also, in the television sitcom The Simpsons, Homer Simpson's love affair with doughnuts is a prominent ongoing joke as well as the focal point of more than a few episodes. There is also a children's book Arnie the Doughnut and music albums The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse and Desert Doughnuts on a plate in Brooklyn New York City, USA In movies, TV shows, and video games, police officers are depicted as enjoying doughnuts during their coffee break. This clich√© has been parodied in the film Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol, where Officer Zed is instructing new recruits how to \\"properly\\" consume their doughnuts with coffee. It is also parodied in the television series Twin Peaks, where the police station is always in large supply.On the B movie matinee show Mystery Science Theater 3000, cop/donut jokes were used so prevalently by the host Joel during the viewing of the sci-fi cop drama Indestructible Man that his robot co-hosts insisted upon him signing a legal document forbidding any further usage of such jokes in the future. See one of the most spectacular \\"donut scenes\\" in the still on the \\"Welcome to Twin Peaks\\" website and read about it in the article \\"Twin Peaks Donut Shop Was Called Wagon Wheel Do-Nuts\\". In the video game Neuromancer, there is a Donut World shop, where only policemen are allowed. During a citywide \\"lockdown\\" after the Boston Marathon bombing, a handful of selected Dunkin' Donuts locations were ordered to remain open to serve police and first responders despite the closing of the vast majority of city businesses.

Owned by the parent Atlanta club and colloquially referred to as the R-Braves, they played their home games at a stadium called The Diamond on Richmond's Northside built for them in 1985, and before then Parker Field on the same site. The franchise moved to Gwinnett County, Georgia in 2009 to play in the newly built Coolray Field as the Gwinnett Braves. The R-Braves came to Richmond in 1966; the Milwaukee Braves' move to Atlanta that year displaced their Triple-A club, the Atlanta Crackers, and Richmond's Parker Field had been left open by the previous year's move of the Richmond Virginians, a New York Yankees affiliate that moved in 1965. At the time of the R-Braves' departure to Gwinnett, only the Baltimore Orioles and their Appalachian League affiliate, the Bluefield Orioles, had held a longer affiliation agreement in a single city than Atlanta/Richmond's 43 seasons. The Braves played their final game on September 1, 2008, against their long-time intrastate rivals, the Norfolk Tides. Richmond won, 9‚Äì3, in front of a sellout crowd of 12,167.

(1981), p. 663. Retrieved 2010-7-15. As a character, she appeared in a song, the first stanza of which often functions now as a nursery rhyme.See, for instance, item 364 in Peter and Iona Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, 1997. This, however, was dependent on a Christmas pantomime, a successor to which is still performed in the United Kingdom. The term's appearance in English dates back to the early 18th century, when Charles Perrault‚Äôs fairy tale collection, Contes de ma M√®re l'Oye, was first translated into English as Tales of My Mother Goose. Later a compilation of English nursery rhymes, titled Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle, helped perpetuate the name both in Britain and the United States. The character Mother Goose's name was identified with English collections of stories and nursery rhymes popularised in the 17th century. English readers would already have been familiar with Mother Hubbard, a stock figure when Edmund Spenser published the satire Mother Hubberd's Tale in 1590, as well as with similar fairy tales told by \\"Mother Bunch\\" (the pseudonym of Madame d'Aulnoy) in the 1690s.Ryoji Tsurumi, \\"The Development of Mother Goose in Britain in the Nineteenth Century\\" Folklore 101.1 (1990:28‚Äì35) p. 330 instances these, as well as the \\"Mother Carey\\" of sailor lore‚Äî\\"Mother Carey's chicken\\" being the European storm-petrel‚Äîand the Tudor period prophetess \\"Mother Shipton\\". An early mention appears in an aside in a versified French chronicle of weekly events, Jean Loret's La Muse Historique, collected in 1650. His remark, comme un conte de la M√®re Oye (\\"like a Mother Goose story\\") shows that the term was readily understood. Additional 17th- century Mother Goose/Mere l'Oye references appear in French literature in the 1620s and 1630s. =Speculation about origins= In the 20th century, Katherine Elwes-Thomas theorised that the image and name \\"Mother Goose\\" or \\"M√®re l'Oye\\" might be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, known as \\"Berthe la fileuse\\" (\\"Bertha the Spinner\\") or Berthe pied d'oie (\\"Goose-Footed Bertha\\" ), often described as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.The Real Personages of Mother Goose, Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co., 1930, p.28 Other scholars have pointed out that Charlemagne's mother, Bertrada of Laon, came to be known as the goose-foot queen (regina pede aucae). There are even sources that trace Mother Goose's origin back to the biblical Queen of Sheba. Mary Goose's gravestone in Granary Burying Ground is shown to tourists in Boston, Massachusetts. Despite evidence to the contrary, it has been stated in the United States that the original Mother Goose was the Bostonian wife of Isaac Goose, either named Elizabeth Foster Goose (1665‚Äì1758) or Mary Goose (d. 1690, age 42). She was reportedly the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six children of her own to add to Isaac's ten.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 23. After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, \\"Mother Goose\\" used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, it was said, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them. No evidence of such printing has been found, and historians believe this story was concocted by Fleet's great-grandson John Fleet Eliot in 1860. Iona and Peter Opie, leading authorities on nursery lore, give no credence to either the Elwes-Thomas or the Boston suppositions. It is generally accepted that the term does not refer to any particular person.The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, Oxford University Press 1997; see the section \\"Mother Goose in America\\", pp. 36‚Äì39 Nursery tales and rhymes Frontispiece from the only known copy of the first English translation, 1729 Charles Perrault, one of the initiators of the literary fairy tale genre, published a collection of such tales in 1695 called Histoires ou contes du temps pass√©s, avec des moralit√©s under the name of his son, which became better known under its subtitle of Contes de ma m√®re l'Oye or Tales of My Mother Goose. Perrault's publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories. An English translation of Perrault's collection, Robert Samber's Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose, appeared in 1729 and was reprinted in America in 1786.Charles Francis Potter, \\"Mother Goose\\", Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legends II (1950), p. 751f. Associated rhymes were once believed to have been published in John Newbery's compilation , or, Sonnets for the cradle some time in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, Newbery's stepson and successor. Although this edition was registered with the Stationers' Company in 1780, no copy has been traced, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784.Nigel Tattersfield in Mother Goose's melody ... (a facsimile of an edition of c. 1795, Oxford: Bodleian Library, 2003). The name \\"Mother Goose\\" has been associated in the English-speaking world with children's poetry ever since. Pantomime In addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character in one recorded by the Opies, only the first verse of which figures in later editions of their book.The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, pp. 373‚Äì4] Titled \\"Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg\\", this verse prefaced a 15-stanza poem that rambled through a variety of adventures involving not only the egg but also Mother Goose's son Jack. There exists an illustrated chapbook omitting their opening stanza that dates from the 1820sAvailable as a PDF from Toronto Public Library and another version was recorded by J. O. Halliwell in his The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842).Google Books, pp.32-4 Other shorter versions were also recorded later. All of them, however, were dependent on a very successful pantomime first performed in 1806, and it is only by reference to its script that the unexplained gaps in the poem's narration are made clear.Jeri Studebaker, Breaking the Mother Goose Code, Moon Books 2015, Chapter 6 The pantomime was the work of Thomas John Dibdin and its title, Harlequin and Mother Goose, or The Golden Egg, signals how it combines the Commedia dell'arte tradition and other folk elements with fable ‚Äì in this case \\"The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\\". The stage version became a vehicle for the clown Joseph Grimaldi, who played the part of Avaro, but there was also a shorter script for shadow pantomime which allowed special effects of a different kind. Dan Leno as Mother Goose Special effects were needed since the folk elements in the story made a witch-figure of Mother Goose. In reference to this, and especially the opening stanza, illustrations of Mother Goose began depicting her as an old lady with a strong chin who wears a tall pointed hat and flies astride a goose. Ryoji Tsurumi has commented on the folk aspects of this figure in his monograph on the play.Ryoji Tsurumi (1990) \\"The Development of Mother Goose in Britain in the Nineteenth Century\\", Folklore 101:1, pp.28-35 In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the very first time onstage, flying a gander ‚Äì and she later raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene. These elements contrast with others from the harlequinade tradition in which the old miser Avaro transforms into Pantaloon, while the young lovers Colin and Colinette become Harlequin and Columbine. A new Mother Goose pantomime was written for the comedian Dan Leno by J. Hickory Wood in 1902. This had a different story line in which the poor but happy Mother Goose is tempted with wealth by the Devil.Caroline Radcliffe, p. 127‚Äì9 \\"Dan Leno, Dame of Drury Lane\\" in Victorian Pantomime: A Collection of Critical Essays, Palgrave Macmillan 2010 This was the ancestor of all the pantomimes of that title that followed, adaptations of which continue to appear.Michael Billington‚Äôs Mother Goose review, The Guardian, 12 Dec. 2016 Because nursery rhymes are usually referred to as Mother Goose songs in the US,The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, p. 1 however, children's entertainments in which a medley of nursery characters are introduced to sing their rhymes often introduced her name into American titles. Early 20th century examples of these include A dream of Mother Goose and other entertainments by J. C. Marchant and S. J. Mayhew (Boston, 1908); Miss Muffet Lost and Found : a Mother Goose play by Katharine C. Baker (Chicago, 1915); The Modern Mother Goose: a play in three acts by Helen Hamilton (Chicago, 1916); and the up-to-the-moment The Strike Mother Goose Settled by Evelyn Hoxie (Franklin Ohio and Denver Colorado, 1922).

Along with Willem Frederik Hermans and Gerard Reve, Mulisch is considered one of the \\"Great Three\\" (De Grote Drie) of Dutch postwar literature. His novel The Assault (1982) was adapted into a film that won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Mulisch's work is also popular among the country's public: a 2007 poll of NRC Handelsblad readers voted his novel The Discovery of Heaven (1992) the greatest Dutch book ever written. He was regularly mentioned as a possible future Nobel laureate. Life Harry Mulisch and Sjoerdje Woudenberg on their wedding day in 1971 Harry Mulisch portrayed by Paul Levitton in 2010 Harry Kurt Victor Mulisch was born on 29 July 1927 in Haarlem in the Netherlands. Mulisch's father was from Austria- Hungary and emigrated to the Netherlands after the First World War. During the German occupation in World War II his father worked for a German bank, which also dealt with confiscated Jewish assets. His mother, Alice Schwarz, was Jewish. Mulisch and his mother escaped transportation to a concentration camp thanks to Mulisch's father's collaboration with the Nazis, but his maternal grandmother died in a gas chamber. Mulisch was raised largely by his parents' housemaid, Frieda Falk. Mulisch said of himself, he did not just write about World War II, he was WWII.\\"VIP Lounge - Harry Mulisch\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, October 26, 1987 Mulisch lived in Amsterdam from 1958 until his death in 2010.

His death occurred at his Amsterdam home and his family was with him at the time. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte described his death as \\"a loss for Dutch literature and the Netherlands\\". Culture minister Halbe Zijlstra bemoaned the demise of the \\"Big Three\\" as Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans had already died. Marlise Simons of The New York Times said his \\"gift for writing with clarity about moral and philosophical themes made him an enormously influential figure in the Netherlands and earned him recognition abroad\\".

Works Mulisch gained international recognition with the film The Assault (1986), based on his book of the same title (1982). It received an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best foreign movie and has been translated into more than twenty languages.

Themes in his work A frequent theme in his work is the Second World War. His father had worked for the Germans during the war and went to prison for three years afterwards. As the war spanned most of Mulisch's formative phase, it had a defining influence on his life and work. In 1963, he wrote a non-fiction work about the Eichmann case: Criminal Case 40/61. Major works set against the backdrop of the Second World War are De Aanslag (The Assault), Het stenen bruidsbed, and Siegfried. Mulisch often incorporated ancient legends or myths in his writings, drawing on Greek mythology (e.g. in De Elementen), Jewish mysticism (in De ontdekking van de Hemel and De Procedure), well known urban legends and politics (Mulisch was politically left-wing, once signing a book \\"dedicated in admiration\\" to Fidel Castro). Mulisch's works are widely read. In 1984 he delivered the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden, The Netherlands, under the title: Het Ene (the unifying principle).

It was separated from the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and was the first newly created Imperial State after the original German stem duchies. Carinthia remained a State of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806, though from 1335 it was ruled within the Austrian dominions of the Habsburg dynasty. A constituent part of the Habsburg Monarchy and of the Austrian Empire, it remained a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria- Hungary until 1918. By the Carinthian Plebiscite in October 1920, the main area of the duchy formed the Austrian state of Carinthia. History In the seventh century the area was part of the Slavic principality of Carantania, which fell under the suzerainty of Duke Odilo of Bavaria in about 743. The Bavarian stem duchy was incorporated into the Carolingian Empire when Charlemagne deposed Odilo's son Duke Tassilo III in 788. In the 843 partition by the Treaty of Verdun, Carinthia became part of East Francia under King Louis the German. From 889 to 976 it was the Carinthian March of the renewed Bavarian duchy, though in 927 the local Count Berthold of the Luitpolding dynasty was vested with ducal rights by the German king Henry the Fowler. After Berthold became Duke of Bavaria in 938, both territories were ruled by him. Upon his death in 948 the Luitpoldings, though heirs of the royal Ottonian dynasty, were not able to retain their possessions, as King Otto I bought the loyalty of his younger brother Henry I with the Bavarian lands. =Establishment= The Duchy of Carinthia with Styrian, Carniolan and Istrian marches (blue) Duke Henry's son Henry II \\"the Quarreller\\" from 974 onwards, revolted against his cousin Emperor Otto II, whereupon he was deposed as Duke of Bavaria in favour of Otto's nephew Duke Otto I of Swabia. At the same time Emperor Otto II created a sixth duchy in addition to the original stem duchies, the new Duchy of Carinthia. He reverted the possession of the territories to the Luitpoldings, when he split Carinthia from the Bavarian lands and installed the former Duke Berthold's son Henry the Younger as duke in 976. Over the centuries, the name 'Carinthia' (K√§rnten) gradually replaced former 'Carantania'. The realm of the Carinthian dukes initially comprised a vast territory including the marches of Styria (marchia Carantana), Carniola and Istria, they also ruled over the Italian March of Verona in the south. Nevertheless, Henry the Younger was the first and also the last Luitpolding duke; as he chose to join the unsuccessful War of the Three Henries against Emperor Otto II, he lost Carinthia two years later and was succeeded by the Emperor's nephew Otto I, a scion of the Salian dynasty. Though Henry once again managed to regain the ducal title in 985, Carinthia upon his death in 989 fell back to the Imperial Ottonian dynasty in Bavaria. =Eppensteins and Sponheims= The Duchy of Carinthia at its maximum expansion Carinthia however remained a separate entity, and in 1012 Count Adalbero I of Eppenstein, Margrave of the Carinthian March (later Styria) since about 1000, was vested with the duchy by the last Ottonian emperor Henry II, while the Istrian march was separated and given to Count Poppo of Weimar. Adalbero was removed from office in 1035 after he had fallen out of favour with the Salian Emperor Conrad II. In 1039 Carinthia was inherited by Emperor Henry III himself, who split off the Carniolan march the following year and granted it to Margrave Poppo of Istria. In 1077, the duchy was given to Luitpold, again a member of the Eppensteiner family, which, however, became extinct with the death of Luitpold's younger brother Henry III of Carinthia in 1122. Upon his death the duchy was further reduced in area: a large part of the Eppenstein lands in what is today Upper Styria passed to Margrave Ottokar II of Styria. The remainder of Carinthia passed from Duke Henry III to his godchild Henry from the House of Sponheim, who ruled as Henry IV, from 1122 to his early death the following year.Mediaeval Genealogy The most outstanding of the Spanheim dukes was Bernhard, the first Carinthian duke who was actually described and honoured in documents as \\"prince of the land\\". The last Spanheim duke was Ulrich III; he signed an inheritance treaty with his brother Archbishop Philip of Salzburg, who however could not prevail against the Bohemian king Ottokar II P≈ôemysl. In spite of being supported by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany, who defeated Ottokar II at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, Philip never gained actual power. The duchy was seized by Rudolph and Philip died a year later in 1279. =Habsburgs= Rudolf, after being elected King of the Romans and defeating King Ottokar II, at first gave Carinthia to Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol. In 1335, after the death of Henry, the last male of this line, Emperor Louis the Bavarian gave Carinthia and the southern part of the Tyrol as an imperial fief to the Habsburg family on 2 May in Linz. The Habsburgs would continue to rule Carinthia until 1918. As with the other component parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, Carinthia remained a semi-autonomous state with its own constitutional structure for a long time. The Habsburgs divided up their territories within the family twice, according to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg and again in 1564. Each time, the Duchy of Carinthia became part of Inner Austria and was ruled jointly with the adjacent duchies of Styria and Carniola. Early 18th century map of Carinthia showing fiefs owned by Salzburg and Bamberg Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II attempted to create a more unitary Habsburg state, and in 1804 Carinthia was integrated into the newly established Austrian Empire under Francis II/I. According to the 1809 Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, the Upper Carinthian territories around Villach formed part of the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces; Carinthia as a whole remained a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Illyria until its dissolution in 1849. In 1867, the duchy became a crown land of Cisleithania, the western part of Austria-Hungary (see History of Austria). The Cisleithanian crown land of Carinthia within Austria-Hungary Over the centuries, the German language, which carried more prestige, expanded at the expense of Slovene, but the fact that in the 16th century the Estates of Carinthia could still point out that Carinthia was \\"a Windic Archduchy\\", i.e. a sovereign Slovene principality, shows that the Carinthian people were aware of their ancient and pre-German roots. =World War I and Carinthian Plebiscite= During World War I, Carinthia experienced a relatively high number of war deaths: thirty-seven for every 1,000 inhabitants. This was higher than in most other German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (except German South Moravia).Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 218. Following the end of the war and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated the Carinthian Canal Valley stretching from Tarvisio as far as Pontafel (172 square miles)‚ÄùK√§rnten.‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago 2010. go to Italy and that the Slovene-speaking areas of the Me≈æa Valley, the Drava Valley area around Unterdrauburg, which was afterwards renamed Dravograd, and the Jezersko area (128 square miles of territory) be ceded to the new SHS State. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, however, was not satisfied with these parts of the former duchy and also occupied land north of the Karawanks mountain range, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. The Entente powers decided on a two-stage referendum, of which the first stage, the Carinthian Plebiscite was held on 10 October 1920 to determine the fate of Carinthia. The outcome in favour of Austria did not change the borders as decided upon in the Treaty of Saint- Germain. Klagenfurt Landhaus Prince's Stone (Kne≈æji kamen) Duke's Chair (Vojvodski prestol) The Austrian part of the former duchy today forms the federal state of Carinthia (), while the area that was ceded to Italy as a part of the claimed \\"Julian March\\" belongs to the autonomous region of Friuli‚ÄìVenezia Giulia. Most of the area awarded to Yugoslavia (cf. Slovenian Carinthia) now forms part of the larger Carinthia Statistical Region in Slovenia.

It was the predecessor of the March of Carinthia, created within the Carolingian Empire in 889. Origin of the name The name Carantania is of proto-Slavic origin. Paul the Deacon mentions Slavs in Carnuntum, which is erroneously called Carantanum (Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum).Simoniti, Vasko & Peter ≈†tih (1996): Slovenska zgodovina do razsvetljenstva. Klagenfurt: Mohorjeva dru≈æba and Korotan. A possible etymological explanation is that it may have been formed from a toponymic base carant- which ultimately derives from pre-Indo-European root *karra meaning 'rock', or that it is of Celtic origin and derived from *karant- meaning 'friend, ally'. Its Slavic name ' was adopted from the Latin *carantanum. The toponym Carinthia (Slovene: < Proto- Slavic *kor«´t‚Äô—åsko) is also claimed to be etymologically related, deriving from pre-Slavic *carantia.France Bezlaj, Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskega jezika (Slovenian Etymological Dictionary). Vol. 2: K-O / edited by Bogomil Gerlanc. - 1982. p. 68. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1976‚Äì2005. The name, like most toponyms beginning with *Kar(n)- in this area of Europe, are in turn most likely linked to the pre-Roman tribe of the Carni that once populated the eastern Alps. Territory Carantania's capital was most likely Karnburg () in the Zollfeld Field (), north of modern-day town of Klagenfurt (). The principality was centered in the area of modern Carinthia, and included territories of modern Styria, most of today's East Tyrol and of the Puster Valley, the Lungau and Ennspongau regions of Salzburg, and parts of southern Upper Austria and Lower Austria. It most probably also included the territory of the modern Slovenian province of Carinthia. The few existing historical sources distinguish between two separate Slavic principalities in the Eastern Alpine area: Carantania and Carniola. The latter, which appears in historical records dating from the late 8th century, was situated in the central part of modern Slovenia. It was (at least by name) the predecessor of the later Duchy of Carniola. The borders of the later Carantania state, which was under the feudal overlordship of the Carolingians, and its successor (the March of Carinthia, 826‚Äì976), as well as of the later Duchy of Carinthia (from 976), extended beyond historical Carantania. History Frankish Empire (AD 788‚Äì843) In the 4th century Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north to the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one AsinioReligious life in the Alps, Switzerland Historical Dictionary in AD 451. In the 6th century, the Alpine Slavs, who are ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the eastern areas of the Friulia region. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli, known as the Friulian Slavia, as well as the Karst Plateau and the area north and south from Gorizia. After the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in 553, the Germanic tribe of the Lombards invaded Italy via Friuli and founded the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, which no longer included all of Tyrol, only its southern part. The northern part of Tyrol came under the influence of the Bavarii, while the west probably was part of Alamannia. In 568, the Langobards receded into northern Italy. Subsequently, in the last decades of the 6th century, Slavs settled in the depopulated territory with the help of their Avar overlords. In 588 they reached the area of the Upper Sava River and in 591 they arrived in the Upper Drava region, where they soon fought the Bavarians under Duke Tassilo I. In 592 the Bavarians won, but three years later in 595 the Slavic-Avar army gained victory and thus consolidated the boundary between the Frankish and the Avar territories.Peter ≈†tih, Ozemlje Slovenije v zgodnjem srednjem veku: osnovne poteze zgodovinskega razvoja od zaƒçetka 6. stoletja do konca 9. stoletja [The territory of Slovenia during early Middle Ages: a basic outline of historical development from early 6th century to late 9th century], Ljubljana, 2001. By that time, today's East Tyrol and Carinthia came to be referred to in historical sources as Provincia Sclaborum (the Country of Slavs).Oto Luthar, ed., \\"The Land Between: A History of Slovenia\\". Frankurt am Main [etc.]: Peter Lang, cop. 2008. .Paulus Diaconus, \\"Historia Langobardorum\\". In the 6th century, the Alpine Slavs, who are reckoned to be among the ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the eastern areas of the Friuli region. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli, known as the Friulian Slavia, as well as the Kras Plateau and the area north and south from Gorizia. In the 6th century Chur was also conquered by the Franks.Franks, page at Switzerland Historical Dictionary Slavic settlement in the Eastern Alps region is assumed to be connected to the collapse of local dioceses in the late 6th century, a change in population and material culture, and most importantly, in the establishment of a Slavic language group in the area. The territory settled by Slavs, however, was also inhabited by the remains of the indigenous Romanized population, which preserved Christianity. Slavs in both the Eastern Alps and the Pannonian region are assumed to be originally subject to Avar rulers (kagans). After Avar rule weakened around 610, a relatively independent March of the Slavs (marca Vinedorum), governed by a duke, emerged in southern Carinthia in the early 7th century. Historical sources mention Valuk as the duke of Slavs (Wallux dux Winedorum). In 623 Slavs of the Eastern Alps probably joined Samo's Tribal Union, a Slavic tribal alliance governed by the Frankish merchant Samo. The year 626 brought an end to Avar dominance over Slavs, as the Avars were defeated at Constantinople.Peter ≈†tih. \\"Slovenska zgodovina: Od prazgodovinskih kultur do konca srednjega veka\\". [Slovenian history: From prehistoric cultures to late Middle Ages] In 658 Samo died and his Tribal Union disintegrated. A smaller part of the original March of the Slavs, centred north of modern Klagenfurt, preserved independence and came to be known as Carantania. The name Carantania itself begins to appear in historical sources soon after 660. The first clear indication of a specific ethnic identity and political organisation may be recognised in the geographical term Carantanum which Paul the Deacon used in reference to the year 664, and in connection to which he also mentioned a specific Slavic people (gens Sclavorum) living there. When about 740 Prince Boruth asked the Bavarian duke Odilo for help against the pressing danger posed by Avar tribes from the east, Carantania lost its independence. Boruth's successors had to accept the overlordship of Bavaria and the semifeudal Frankish kingdom, ruled by Charlemagne from 771 to 814. Charlemagne also put an end to the invasions undertaken by the Avars, who had regained eastern parts of Carantania between 745 and 795. In 828, Carantania finally became a margraviate of the Carolingian Empire. The local princes were deposed for following the anti- Frankish rebellion of the Lower Pannonian prince Ljudevit Posavski and replaced by a Germanic (primarily Bavarian) ascendancy. By the 843 Treaty of Verdun, it passed into the hands of Louis the German (804‚Äì876) who, according to the Annales Fuldenses (863), gave the title of a \\"prefect of the Carantanians\\" (praelatus Carantanis) to his eldest son Carloman.Goldberg, Eric Joseph (2006). Struggle for Empire: Kingship and Conflict Under Louis the German, 817‚Äì876. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. In 887 Arnulf of Carinthia (850‚Äì899), a grandson of Louis the German, assumed his title of King of the East Franks and became the first Duke of Carinthia. The city of Chur suffered several invasions by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed. The Ducal Inauguration Church of Maria Saal (Gospa Sveta) The principality of Carantania is particularly notable for the ancient ritual of installing Carantanian dukes (or princes, both an approximate translation of Knez/Knyaz/F√ºrst), a practice that continued after Carantania was incorporated into the later Duchy of Carinthia. It was last performed in 1414, when the Habsburg Ernest the Iron was enthroned as Duke of Carinthia. The ritual took place on the Prince's Stone (Slovene Kne≈æji kamen, German F√ºrstenstein), an ancient Roman column capital near Krnski grad (now Karnburg) and was performed in Slovene by a free peasant who, selected by his peers, in the name of the people of the land questioned the new Prince about his integrity and reminded him of his duties. Later, when the Duchy of Carinthia had fallen to the Habsburgs, the idea that it was actually the people from whom the Duke of Carinthia received his legitimation was the basis of the Habsburgs' claim to the unique title of Archduke. The coronation of Carinthian Dukes consisted of three parts: first, a ritual in Slovene was performed at the Prince's Stone; then a mass was held at the cathedral of Maria Saal (); and subsequently, a ceremony took place at the Duke's Chair (, German: ), where the new Duke swore an oath in German and where he also received the homage of the estates. The Duke's Chair is located at Zollfeld valley, north of Klagenfurt in modern Carinthia, Austria. The ceremony was first described by the chronicler John of Viktring on the occasion of the coronation of Meinhard II of Tyrol in 1286. It is also mentioned in Jean Bodin's book Six livres de la R√©publique in 1576. Mentions in late medieval literature Chronicle of Fredegar mentions Carantania as Sclauvinia, Dante Alighieri (1265‚Äì1321) mentions Carantania as Chiarentana. The same name was also used by Florentines, such as the poet Fazio degli Uberti (circa 1309‚Äì1367), the famous chronicler Giovanni Villani (c. 1275‚Äì1348), and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313‚Äì1375), who wrote that the Brenta River rises from the mountains of Carantania, a land in the Alps dividing Italy from Germany. Ethnic and social structure The population of ancient Carantania had a polyethnic structure. The core stratum was represented by two groups of Slavs who had settled in the Eastern Alps region in 6th century and are the ancestors of the present-day Slovenes and partially also Austrians. Other ethnic strong element included the descendants of the Romanised aboriginal peoples (Noricans), which is attestable on the basis of a recent DNA analysis and a number of place names. It is also possible that traces of Dulebes, Avars, Bulgars, Croats and the Germanic peoples were present among Carantanians. The people of Carantania are considered to have been among the precursors and ancestors of modern Slovenes and Austrians (mainly southern). Language The installation of the Dukes of Carinthia according to a Medieval chronicle In its early stages, the language of Carantanian Slavs was essentially Proto-Slavic. In Slovenian linguistic literature and reference books it is sometimes provisionally termed Alpine Slavic (alpska slovan≈°ƒçina). Its Proto-Slavic character can be deduced from language contacts of Alpine Slavs with the remainders of the Romanised aboriginal population, later also with Bavarians. The adopted Pre-Slavic placenames and rivernames and their subsequent phonetic development in Alpine Slavic, as well as Bavarian records of Alpine Slavic names, shed light on the characteristics of the Alpine Slavic language. From the 9th century onwards, Alpine Slavic underwent a series of gradual changes and innovations which were characteristic of South Slavic languages. By roughly the 13th century, these developments gave rise to the Slovene language.Tine Logar, \\"Pregled zgodovine slovenskega jezika\\" (An Outline of the History of Slovene Language).

(1990) Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. The term ‚Äúpupil‚Äù was created by Gerard of Cremona. In humans, the pupil is round, but its shape varies between species; some cats, reptiles, and foxes have vertical slit pupils, goats have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop. The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil, which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea. On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil.  Structure  The pupil is a hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. Function The iris is a contractile structure, consisting mainly of smooth muscle, surrounding the pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil, and the iris regulates the amount of light by controlling the size of the pupil. This is known as the pupillary light reflex. The iris contains two groups of smooth muscles; a circular group called the sphincter pupillae, and a radial group called the dilator pupillae. When the sphincter pupillae contract, the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil. The dilator pupillae, innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, cause the pupil to dilate when they contract. These muscles are sometimes referred to as intrinsic eye muscles. The sensory pathway (rod or cone, bipolar, ganglion) is linked with its counterpart in the other eye by a partial crossover of each eye's fibers. This causes the effect in one eye to carry over to the other. =Effect of light= The pupil gets wider in the dark and narrower in light. When narrow, the diameter is 2 to 4 millimeters. In the dark it will be the same at first, but will approach the maximum distance for a wide pupil 3 to 8 mm. However, in any human age group there is considerable variation in maximal pupil size. For example, at the peak age of 15, the dark- adapted pupil can vary from 4 mm to 9 mm with different individuals. After 25 years of age, the average pupil size decreases, though not at a steady rate. At this stage the pupils do not remain completely still, therefore may lead to oscillation, which may intensify and become known as hippus. The constriction of the pupil and near vision are closely tied. In bright light, the pupils constrict to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain their expected acuity; in the dark, this is not necessary, so it is chiefly concerned with admitting sufficient light into the eye.\\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and Function of the Eye\\" Encyclop√¶dia Brtiannicam Chicago, 1987 When bright light is shone on the eye, light-sensitive cells in the retina, including rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells, will send signals to the oculomotor nerve, specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces the size of the pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex, which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest. Clinical significance =Effect of drugs= Pupil dilated for retina examination If the drug pilocarpine is administered, the pupils will constrict and accommodation is increased due to the parasympathetic action on the circular muscle fibers, conversely, atropine will cause paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) and dilation of the pupil. Certain drugs cause constriction of the pupils, such as opioids. Other drugs, such as atropine, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine and amphetamines may cause pupil dilation. The sphincter muscle has a parasympathetic innervation, and the dilator has a sympathetic innervation. In pupillary constriction induced by pilocarpine, not only is the sphincter nerve supply activated but that of the dilator is inhibited. The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle. Another term for the constriction of the pupil is miosis. Substances that cause miosis are described as miotic. Dilation of the pupil is mydriasis. Dilation can be caused by mydriatic substances such as an eye drop solution containing tropicamide. = Diseases = A condition called bene dilitatism occurs when the optic nerves are partially damaged. This condition is typified by chronically widened pupils due to the decreased ability of the optic nerves to respond to light. In normal lighting, people afflicted with this condition normally have dilated pupils, and bright lighting can cause pain. At the other end of the spectrum, people with this condition have trouble seeing in darkness. It is necessary for these people to be especially careful when driving at night due to their inability to see objects in their full perspective. This condition is not otherwise dangerous. = Size = The size of the pupil (often measured as diameter) can be a symptom of an underlying disease. Dilation of the pupil is known as mydriasis and contraction as miosis. Not all variations in size are indicative of disease however. In addition to dilation and contraction caused by light and darkness, it has been shown that solving simple multiplication problems affects the size of the pupil. The simple act of recollection can dilate the size of the pupil, however when the brain is required to process at a rate above its maximum capacity, the pupils contract. There is also evidence that pupil size is related to the extent of positive or negative emotional arousal experienced by a person. Other animals The W-shaped pupil of the cuttlefish expanding when the lights are turned off. Not all animals have circular pupils. Some have slits or ovals which may be oriented vertically, as in crocodiles, vipers, cats and foxes, or horizontally as in some rays, flying frogs, mongooses and artiodactyls such as sheep, elk, red deer, reindeer and hippopotamus, as well as the domestic horse. Goats, toads and octopus pupils tend to be horizontal and rectangular with rounded corners. Some skates and rays have crescent shaped pupils, gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes, and the cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W shape. Although human pupils are normally circular, abnormalities like colobomas can result in unusual pupil shapes, such as teardrop, keyhole or oval pupil shapes. There may be differences in pupil shape even between closely related animals. In felids, there are differences between small- and large eyed species. The domestic cat (Felis sylvestris domesticus) has vertical slit pupils, its large relative the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) has circular pupils and the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is intermediate between those of the domestic cat and the Siberian tiger. A similar difference between small and large species may be present in canines. The small red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has vertical slit pupils whereas their large relatives, the gray wolf (Canis lupus lupus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have round pupils. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they can exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil. This would explain why slit pupils tend to be found in the eyes of animals with a crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle that need to protect their eyes during daylight. Constriction of a circular pupil (by a ring-shaped muscle) is less complete than closure of a slit pupil, which uses two additional muscles that laterally compress the pupil. For example, the cat's slit pupil can change the light intensity on the retina 135-fold compared to 10-fold in humans. However, this explanation does not account for circular pupils that can be closed to a very small size (e.g., 0.5 mm in the tarsier) and the rectangular pupils of many ungulates which do not close to a narrow slit in bright light. An alternative explanation is that a partially constricted circular pupil shades the peripheral zones of the lens which would lead to poorly focused images at relevant wavelengths. The vertical slit pupil allows for use of all wavelengths across the full diameter of the lens, even in bright light. It has also been suggested that in ambush predators such as some snakes, vertical slit pupils may aid in camouflage, breaking up the circular outline of the eye. In a study of Australian snakes, pupil shapes correlated both with diel activity times and with foraging behaviour. Most snake species with vertical pupils were nocturnal and also ambush foragers, and most snakes with circular pupils were diurnal and active foragers. Overall, foraging behaviour predicted pupil shape accurately in more cases than did diel time of activity, because many active-foraging snakes with circular pupils were not diurnal. It has been suggested that there may be a similar link between foraging behaviour and pupil shape amongst the felidae and canidae discussed above. A 2015 study confirmed the hypothesis that elongated pupils have increased dynamic range, and furthered the correlations with diel activity. However it noted that other hypotheses could not explain the orientation of the pupils. They showed that vertical pupils enable ambush predators to optimise their depth perception, and horizontal pupils to optimise the field of view and image quality of horizontal contours. They further explained why elongated pupils are correlated with the animal's height.

This is true, for example, of the word pupil itself: this comes into English from Latin p≈´pilla, which means \\"doll, girl\\", and is a diminutive form of pupa, \\"girl\\". (The double meaning in Latin is preserved in English, where pupil means both \\"schoolchild\\" and \\"dark central portion of the eye within the iris\\".)\\"pupil, n.2.\\", Oxford English Dictionary Online, 3rd. edn (Oxford University Press, 2007). This may be because the reflection of one's image in the pupil is a minuscule version of one's self.Human Universals and Human Culture, p4. In the Old Babylonian period (c. 1800-1600 BC) in ancient Mesopotamia, the expression \\"protective spirit of the eye\\" is attested, perhaps arising from the same phenomenon. The English phrase apple of my eye arises from an Old English usage, in which the word apple meant not only the fruit but also the pupil or eyeball.apple, n.\\", Oxford English Dictionary Online, 3rd ed.

The film was produced by Thomas H. Ince, directed by Reginald Barker, and co-written by C. Gardner Sullivan and Ince. The film stars stage actor George Beban in the title role as the Italian immigrant, Pietro \\"Beppo\\" Donnetti. In 1991, this film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot The film tells the story of Pietro \\"Beppo\\" Donnetti. Donnetti is a poor, but happy, gondolier in Venice, Italy. Beppo falls in love with Annette Ancello, but her father, Trudo, wants her to marry another suitor, one who is a successful businessman. If Beppo can prove himself within a year, Trudo agrees to allow him to marry Annette. Beppo sails for America to make his fortune, making a living working as a shoeshiner on a street corner in New York City. He borrows money from an Irish ward boss, Bill Corrigan, and sends for Annette to join him. In exchange, Beppo agrees to help Corrigan's candidate win the Italian vote in the ward. When Annette arrives in New York, she and Beppo are married, and the following year they have a son, Tony. Beppo, Annette and Tony live a happy life in their Lower East Side tenement. The happiness is interrupted when the baby contracts a fever during a heatwave. The doctor instructs them to feed pasteurized milk to the baby. Beppo works hard to earn the money to purchase the expensive milk. While walking to the store to buy the milk, Beppo is robbed. He attacks the men who robbed him and is arrested. Beppo asks Corrigan to help his baby while he is in jail: \\"I must get-a-de- milk or my babee is die.\\" Corrigan rebuffs Beppo, and Beppo's baby dies during Beppo's five days in jail. When Beppo is released from jail, he learns that Corrigan's young daughter is ill and vows to avenge his son's death by killing Corrigan's daughter. Beppo sneaks into Corrigan's house, but when he sees Corrigan's daughter lying in her crib, he cannot act on his plan, and he leaves the child unharmed. In the final scene of the narrative, Beppo is shown placing flowers and sobbing over his son's grave. Prologue and epilogue The film employs a prologue and epilogue to frame the narrative story. In the prologue, a stage curtain rises and shows the lead actor, George Beban, in an upper class apartment wearing a smoking jacket. He sits on a couch and opens a book titled \\"The Italian\\" by Thomas H. Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan. As he begins reading, the film fades into the narrative story. In the epilogue, the film shifts from the image of Beppo kneeling at his son's grave to Beban turning to the last page of the book, closing the book and looking thoughtful. The stage curtain is then drawn closed. Some critics have suggested the prologue and epilogue were intended to demonstrate the care with which Beban, a noted stage actor, had selected a story worthy of his talents. Production Screenwriter C. Gardner Sullivan (pictured) wrote the story with Thomas H. Ince. Historical accounts indicate that Thomas Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan had originally titled their project Dago, but agreed to change the title at the request of the film's star, George Beban. The Italian marked the first motion picture role for Beban, who had gained acclaim as a Broadway actor and vaudevillian specializing in ethnic caricatures. (\\"'The Italian,' featuring the celebrated artist, George Beban, extensively known as a performer of superior merit ... Mr. Beban is famed far and wide for his very fine dramatic work in many roles, notably in his repertoire, being, 'The Sign of the Rose.' This is Mr. Beban's first appearance in screen work and from 'The Italian' we may expect unusually fine productions in which he takes the leading part.\\") Beban only agreed to join the project for a salary of $7000 and a percentage of the films profits. Ince and Sullivan are credited with writing the film's story, but film historian Kevin Brownlow has shown that the plot was essentially lifted from the earlier Independent Moving Pictures (Ince's former employer) film The Wop (1913). Though set on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the New York scenes for The Italian were shot in the immigrant quarter of San Francisco. While most accounts indicate that the scenes of Beppo as a gondolier were shot in the Venice district of Los Angeles, an account published by the Los Angeles Times in November 1914 reported that \\"Ince sent Beban to Italy to get special canal scenes for the eight-reel play.\\" One of the vivid scenes in The Italian is the fight scene between Beppo and his muggers. The scene lasts five minutes on the screen, and a newspaper story reported that, for realism, \\"a number of the biggest men at Inceville were used in the scene.\\" In a story on the production of The Italian, a newspaper reported that a hundred pounds of rice were bought for the film's wedding scene. An initial order of fifty pounds of rice was left uncovered overnight by a \\"property man\\" at the Inceville studio. A \\"heavy rain caused each grain to swell to enormous proportions,\\" requiring the purchase of another fifty pounds of rice. Cast * George Beban ... Pietro \\"Beppo\\" Donnetti * Clara Williams ...

Its simplicity and utter humanness have an appeal that reaches straight to the heart of the onlooker.\\" Another review in the same paper also commended the \\"simple beauty of the story itself\\" and also praised Beban's performance: > \\"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece > of character work that is truly marvelous.

Ince's masterpiece and is said to be greater than his 'Wrath of the Gods,' 'The Typhoon' and 'The Bargain.'\\" =Modern assessments= In 2008, The Italian was released on DVD as part of a two-disc compilation titled, \\"Perils of the New Land: Films of the Immigrant Experience (1910-1915).\\" At the time of the DVD release, The New York Times praised the film for Reginald Barker's strong direction, including his use of a mobile camera and \\"liberal use of close-up\\" which give the film a subjective, personal feel. The Times also praised Beban's \\"powerful lead performance\\" which it described as follows: > \\"The audience is drawn to identify with Beppo, even though he remains in > many respects an appalling ethnic caricature: dark, brooding, vengeful. That > Barker and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for Beppo, despite > their own, occasionally quite obvious condescension to the character, is a > mark of emerging maturity in the movie business; no longer are films dealing > in one-dimensional 'types.'\\" The Los Angeles Times in 2008 described The Italian as \\"a shameless melodrama that, despite unfortunate stereotypes, musters considerable sympathy for its titular immigrant.\\" The Times also noted that \\"Beban, the silent-era star known for his ethnic impersonations, hams up a storm as Beppo, a jaunty Venetian.\\" The film publication Cineaste published a review of The Italian in March 2009, focusing on the film's depiction of the Italian-American immigrant experience as a Darwinian jungle rather than a promised land paved with gold: > \\"Against Horatio Alger expectations, The Italian is a story of failure > suffused with a soft-focused, dappled nostalgia for the old country ... > 'From sunny Italy to the New York ghetto,' read the taglines on Paramount's > original one-sheet, contrasting scenes of 'carefree Beppo at home' in the > serene canals of Old Italy with the mean streets of New York where 'to live > your baby must have Pasteurized milk.' America is not a promised land paved > with gold but a Darwinian jungle, where dreams meet dead ends.\\" Cineaste also credited Beban for his intense performance, commenting on the fight sequence in which Beban's character \\"seethes with murderous determination\\" as the camera focuses on his face in an extreme close-up: \\"Beban's sudden transformation from amiability to wrath recalls the first glimpse of Spencer Tracy after nearly being lynched in Fritz Lang's Fury.\\" A reviewer for the publication Bright Sights wrote that the film had a powerfully downbeat conclusion with a social message: > \\"Projecting overwhelming grief, Beban reveals some hefty acting chops, and > The Italian certainly gets its liberal point across, a model of how American > movies dress social consciousness in the garb of melodrama. Even here, in > its infancy, feature film was eager to pick up the call for social reform > that sounded out in urban America before the First World War.\\" In his 2004 historical book on the depiction of Italians in Hollywood movies, Peter Bondanella praised the film: > \\"A number of elements sets The Italian apart from the other films treating > the Italian immigrant experience. ... Its melodramatic plot reflects a > serious sense of artistic construction, aimed at milking the last bit of > emotion out of the audience. George Beban's outstanding performance shows > his roots in the dramatic theater. ... Finally, the depiction of the tragic > story of Beppo shows a certain sympathy for the character of the poor > Italian bootblack but also includes a callous disregard for depicting > Italian immigrants in a stereotypical manner, an attitude that no doubt > reflected the opinions of the majority of Americans at the time. Its plot is > simple and compelling.\\"Bondanella, Hollywood Italians, p. 23 Director Reginald Barker has been credited for his innovations in filming The Italian. Despite its occasional use of patronizing stereotypes, Bondanella concludes that Beppo \\"is represented with great dignity and even comic twists, making Beppo a far more lovable figure than one might expect.\\"Bondanella, Hollywood Italians, p. 27 He concludes his chapter on the film with the following comment: \\"In short, what emerges from The Italian is an unusually complex view of tenement life and multiethnic immigration in America, and the film consequently retains its value not only as social history but also as a work of art.\\"Bondanella, Hollywood Italians, p. 28 In his book about the history of film editing, Don Fairservice credits The Italian's director, Reginald Barker, for his early use of editing to maintain story continuity and for his use of multidirectional camera positioning and variable framing to emphasize character development and psychological motivation rather than plot. A review in DVD Talk concluded that Beban's performance was able to overcome the film's melodramatic premise: > \\"Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another > standout moment. The camera does a very tight closeup, one of the closest I > can recall for a film from 1915, and his anger and fear are almost > palatable. ...

Biography Melik was born in the village of ƒårna Vas in Carniola, part of Austria-Hungary. Before and during World War I, he studied at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1916 in history and geography. Later he was employed as a secondary school teacher. In 1926‚Äì1927 he became a senior university teacher at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana, in 1932 a senior lecturer, and then in 1938 a professor. In 1927 he received his PhD from the Faculty of Arts with his dissertation on the settlement of the Ljubljana Marshes. Between 1938 and 1966, he was a professor of geomorphology at the Department of Geography at the University of Ljubljana, succeeding professor Artur Gavazzi in 1938. With his work in this field he established his well-known geomorphological school. In 1935‚Äì1936, the publishing house Slovenska matica published his monumental work Geografija Slovenije (The Geography of Slovenia) in two volumes with a general regional part, later extended with four additional books between 1954 and 1960, with a detailed regional description of particular areas of Slovenia: the Alps, Styria with Prekmurje and the Me≈æica Valley, the Sava Valley, and the Slovenian Littoral. Between 1947 and 1960, Melik was head of the Department of Geography at the Faculty of Arts. Between 1948 and 1966, he was head of the Geographical Institute of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Between 1946/1947 and 1949/1950, he was chancellor of the University of Ljubljana, and he served twice as dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1940/1941 and 1945/1946. He retired in 1966. He died in Ljubljana. In 1976, the Geographical Institute of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, founded in 1946, was renamed the Anton Melik Geographical Institute in his honor. Family His two brothers Franc Melik (born 1885), and Ivan Melik (born 1894) were killed in a grove known as Kosler's Thicket (, named after its former owner Peter Kosler), on November 25, 1943 together with 12 other victims by a unit of the collaborationist Slovenian Home Guard militia under the command of Franc Frakelj. For his work on the geography of Slovenia and Yugoslavia, Melik received the Pre≈°eren Award in 1947, 1949, and 1951. His son, Vasilij Melik, was a historian; his two other sons, Anton (1918) and Andrej (1927‚Äì1930), died as children.

He participated in the conquest of Cuba, in Juan de Grijalva's exploration of the coasts of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico, and in the conquest of Mexico led by Hern√°n Cort√©s. He is considered the conquistador of much of Central America, including Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Although renowned for his skill as a soldier, Alvarado is known also for the cruelty of his treatment of native populations, and mass murders committed in the subjugation of the native peoples of Mexico.Le√≥n Portilla 2006, pp. 131‚Äì132. Character and appearance Pedro de Alvarado was flamboyant and charismatic,Myers 2004, pp. 19, 182. and was both a brilliant military commanderRecinos 1986, pp. 205, 207. and a cruel, hardened man. His hair and beard were red, which reminded them of their sun-god (often painted red) T≈çnatiuh. He was handsome,Le√≥n Portilla 2006, p. 132. and presented an affable appearance, but was volatile and quick to anger.Burland 1973, p. 216. He was ruthless in his dealings with the indigenous peoples he set out to conquer. Historians judge that his greed drove him to excessive cruelty,Recinos 1986, p. 205. and his Spanish contemporaries denounced his extreme brutality during his lifetime. He was a poor governor of territories he had conquered, and restlessly sought out new adventures.Recinos 1998, p. 17. His tactical brutality, such as the massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, often undermined strategic considerations.Recinos 1998, p. 18. He was also accused of cruelty against fellow Spaniards.Recinos 1986, p. 206. Alvarado was little suited to govern; when he held governing positions, he did little to establish stable foundations for colonial rule. His letters show no interest in civil matters, and he only discussed exploration and war. Alvarado stubbornly resisted attempts by the Spanish Crown to establish ordered taxation in Guatemala, and refused to acknowledge such attempts. As governor of Guatemala, Alvarado has been described by W. George Lovell et al. as \\"an insatiable despot who recognized no authority but his own and who regarded Guatemala as little more than his personal estate.\\" American historian William H. Prescott described Alvarado's character in the following terms: Spanish chronicler Antonio de Remesal commented that \\"Alvarado desired more to be feared than loved by his subjects, whether they were Indians or Spaniards.\\"Recinos 1986, p. 208. In his easy recourse to violence, Alvarado was a product of his time, and Alvarado was not the only conquistador to have resorted to such actions. Hern√°n Cort√©s and Francisco Pizarro carried out deeds of similar cruelty, but have not attracted as much criticism as Alvarado.Recinos 1986, p. 209. Early life and family Pedro de Alvarado was born in 1485 in the town of Badajoz, Extremadura.Recinos 1986, p. 9. His father was G√≥mez de Alvarado, and his mother was Leonor de Contreras, G√≥mez's second wife. Pedro de Alvarado had a twin sister, Sarra, and four full-blood brothers, Jorge, Gonzalo, G√≥mez, and Juan.Recinos 1986, p. 10. Pedro had an illegitimate half brother, also named Juan, referred to in contemporary sources as Juan el Bastardo.Recinos 1986, pp. 10, 21. Very little is known of Pedro de Alvarado's early life before his arrival in the Americas. During the conquest of the Americas, tales of his youthful exploits in Spain became popular legends, but their veracity is doubtful.Recinos 1986, pp. 10-11. An example is the tale then current that when he was a youth awaiting passage to the Americas, he climbed the church tower in Seville with some friends. A banner pole extended some from an upper window. One of his companions walked out to the end of the pole after removing his cloak and sword, and returned to the tower backwards. Alvarado, afraid of being mocked, walked out onto the pole with both sword and cloak, and turned around at the end to return to the tower facing it.Recinos 1986, pp. 11-12. Alvarado's paternal grandfather was Juan Alvarado \\"el Viejo\\" (\\"the elder\\"), who was comendador of Hornachos, and his paternal grandmother was Catalina Mess√≠a. Pedro de Alvarado's uncle on his father's side was Diego de Alvarado y Mess√≠a,Recinos 1986, pp. 9-10. who was the comendador of Lob√≥n, Puebla, and Montijo, alcalde of Mont√°nchez, and lord of Castellanos and of Cubillana. Diego was a veteran of the campaigns against the Moors. First campaigns in the Americas Alvarado and his brothers crossed the Atlantic Ocean before 1511, possibly in 1510.Gall 1967, p. 38. By 1511 a system of licenses had been established in Spain to control the flow of colonists to the New World. The only one of the Alvarado brothers that appears in the registers is Juan de Alvarado, in 1511, leading to the assumption that the rest were already in the Americas by the time the licensing system was established.Recinos 1986, p. 14. The Alvarado brothers stopped off at Hispaniola, but there are few mentions of their stay there in historical documents.Recinos 1986, pp. 14-15. Soon after arriving in Santo Domingo, on Hispaniola, Pedro de Alvarado established a friendship with Hern√°n Cort√©s, who at the time was serving as public scribe. Alvarado joined Cort√©s to participate in the conquest of Cuba, under the command of Diego de Vel√°zquez. The conquest of Cuba was launched in 1511, and Pedro de Alvarado was accompanied by his brothers.Recinos 1986, p. 17. Soon after the invasion, Alvarado was managing a prosperous hacienda in the new colony.Recinos 1986, p. 16. It is around this time that Pedro de Alvarado emerges into the historical record as a prosperous and influential hacienda- owner, already well connected with Vel√°zquez, who was now governor of Cuba. =Grijalva expedition, 1518= Diego Vel√°zquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba's report of gold in the newly discovered Yucat√°n Peninsula.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. He organised an expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Clendinnen 2003, p. 14. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in overall command;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Recinos 1986, p. 18. Pedro de Alvarado captained one of the ships.Recinos 1986, p. 18. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 14‚Äì15. The fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucat√°n. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish; the fleet then sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760. Clendinnen 2003, p. 15. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast. On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bah√≠a de la Ascensi√≥n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760. Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north to loop around the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. The Maya remained hidden in the forest, so the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.Clendinnen 2003, p. 15. At Champot√≥n, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 15‚Äì16. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold- rich empire,Clendinnen 2003, p. 16. sailing as far north as P√°nuco River. At the Papaloapan River, Alvarado ordered his ship upriver, leaving the rest of the small fleet behind to wait for him at the river mouth. This action greatly angered Grijalva, who feared that a lone ship could be lost. After this, the Spanish referred to the river as the R√≠o de Alvarado (\\"Alvarado's River\\").Recinos 1986, p. 19. A little further along the coast, the fleet encountered settlements under Aztec dominion, and was met by Aztec emissaries with gifts of gold and jewels sent by the Emperor Moctezuma II.Recinos 1986, pp. 19-20. As punishment for entering the Papaloapan River without orders, Grijalva sent Alvarado with the ship San Sebasti√°n to relay news of the discoveries back to Cuba. Alvarado made a triumphal entry to Santiago de Cuba, with a great display of the wealth that had been gained from the expedition. His early arrival in Cuba allowed him to ingratiate himself with the Governor Vel√°zquez before Grijalva's return.Recinos 1986, p. 20. The rest of the fleet put into the port of Havana five months after it had left. Grijalva was coldly received by the governor, who Alvarado had turned against him, claiming much of the glory of the expedition for himself.Recinos 1986, p. 21. Expedition to Mexico, 1519 alt=Old painting of a bearded young man facing slightly to the right. He is wearing a dark jacket with a high collar topped by a white ruff, with ornate buttons down the front. The painting is dark and set in an oval with the letters \\"HERNAN CORTES\\" in a rectangle underneath. Grijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hern√°n Cort√©s was placed in command; Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers Jorge, G√≥mez and Juan \\"El Bastardo\\" joined the expedition. Cort√©s charged Pedro de Alvarado with gathering recruits from the inland estates of Cuba. The crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Crist√≥bal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition. Alvarado once again commanded the San Sabasti√°n, with 60 men under his orders.Garc√≠a A√±overos 1987, p. 245. The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761. In Tabasco, the fleet anchored at Potonch√°n,Townsend 1995, p. 16. a Chontal Maya town.Hern√°ndez et al 2010, p. 26. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. From Potonch√°n, the fleet continued to San Juan de Ulua.Levy, Buddy. \\"Conquistador.\\" Bantam Books, 2008, p. 29. The crew stayed only a short time before relocating to a promontory near QuiahuiztlanLevy, Buddy. \\"Conquistador.\\" Bantam Books, 2008, p. 42. and Cempoala, a subject city of the Aztec Empire,. Some of the Spaniards stayed near the coast when Cort√©s journeyed inland but Alvarado accompanied Cort√©s on the inland march.Thomas, Hugh. COnquest: Montezuma, Cortes, and the Fall of Old Mexico. Simon and Schuster, 1993, p. 233 While marching toward Tenochtitlan, the expedition made a slight detour to travel through Tlaxcalteca lands. The Tlaxcalteca attacked the Spanish force numerous times but they were unable to rout the Spanish forces. After making an alliance with the Tlaxcalteca, the Spanish went on to conquer the Aztecs.Townsend 1995, pp. 16ff. The remains of the \\"Castillo de Alvarado\\", Chamela, Jalisco. Alvarado commanded one of the eleven vessels in the fleet and also acted as Cort√©s' second in command during the expedition's first stay in the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitl√°n. Relations between the Spaniards and their hosts were uneasy, especially given Cort√©s' repeated insistence that the Aztecs desist from idol worship and human sacrifice; in order to ensure their own safety, the Spaniards took the Aztec king Moctezuma hostage. When Cort√©s returned to the Gulf coast to deal with the newly arrived hostile expedition of P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez, Alvarado remained in Tenochtitlan as commander of the Spanish enclave, with strict orders to make sure that Moctezuma not be permitted to escape.\\"Conquered Conquistadors\\", Florine G.L. Asselbergs, First Edition, published 2004 During Cort√©s' absence, relations between the Spaniards and their hosts went from bad to worse, and Alvarado led a massacre of Aztec nobles and priests observing a religious festival. Alvarado claims he did so because he feared the Aztecs were plotting against him but there is no physical evidence to support this claim and the alleged warnings he received came from tortured captives that very likely would have said anything to make the torture stop.Levy, Buddy. Conquistador. Bantam Books, 2009, p.166 When Cort√©s returned to Tenochtitlan, he found the Spanish force under siege. After Moctezuma was killed in the attempt to negotiate with his own people, the Spaniards determined to escape by fighting their way across one of the causeways that led from the city across the lake and to the mainland. In a bloody nocturnal action of 10 July 1520, known as La Noche Triste, Alvarado led the rear-guard and was badly wounded. According to satirical verses by Gonzalo Ocampo, in reference to Alvarado crossing a causeway gap during the escape, Alvarado's escape became known as Salto de Alvarado (\\"Alvarado's Leap\\"). Pedro then participated in the Siege of Tenochtitlan, commanding one of four forces under Cort√©s. Alvarado was wounded when Guatemoc attacked all three Spanish camps on the feast day of St. John. Alvarado's company was the first to make it to the Tlateloco marketplace, setting fire to the Aztec shrines. Cort√©s' and Sandoval's companies joined him there after four more days of fighting. Conquest of Soconusco and Guatemala Cort√©s despatched Pedro de Alvarado to invade Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78-79. Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523, en route to conquer Guatemala.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery;Recinos 1986, p. 62. there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco.Recinos 1986, p. 64. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to Hern√°n Cort√©s describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado.Recinos 1986, p. 63. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces.Gasco 1997, pp. 55‚Äì56. A page from the Lienzo de Tlaxcala showing the conquest of Quetzaltenango. Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samal√° River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K'iche' kingdom, and a K'iche' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K'iche'.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitl√°n by his Mexican allies (modern San Francisco Zapotitl√°n). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K'iche' archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.Recinos 1986, p. 65. Gall 1967, pp. 40‚Äì41. Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K'iche' heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K'iche' warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K'iche', who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K'iche' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764. Gall 1967, p. 41. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524,Gall 1967, p. 41. a K'iche' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K'iche' nobles were among the dead. This battle exhausted the K'iche' militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q'umarkaj, which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K'iche' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q'umarkaj with his army.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 765. alt=Grass- and scrub-covered ruins set against a backdrop of low pine forest.

In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q'umarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K'iche' after their catastrophic defeat,Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. Recinos 1986, pp. 68, 74. fearing that he was entering a trap.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside.Recinos 1986, p. 74. Fearing the great number of K'iche' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q'umarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the king elect) to visit him in his camp.Recinos 1986, p. 75. Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers.Recinos 1986, p. 75. At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city.Recinos 1986, pp. 74‚Äì5. Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 764‚Äì765. After the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance. =Kaqchikel alliance and conquest of the Tz'utujil= On 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K'iche', the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillem√≠n 1965, p. 9.Recinos places all these dates two days earlier (e.g. the Spanish arrival at Iximche on 12 April rather than 14 April) based on vague dating in Spanish primary records. Schele and Fahsen calculated all dates on the more securely dated Kaqchikel annals, where equivalent dates are often given in both the Kaqchikel and Spanish calendars. The Schele and Fahsen dates are used in this section. Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 386. n. 15. The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K'iche' resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz'utuhil kingdom.Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297. The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitl√°n, Escuintla and Cuscatl√°n. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July, Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (\\"St. James of the Knights of Guatemala\\").Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 297. Recinos 1998, p. 101. Guillem√≠n 1965, p. 10. The Tz'utujil kingdom had its capital on the shore of alt=View across hills to a broad lake bathed in a light mist. The mountainous lake shore curves from the left foreground backwards and to the right, with several volcanoes rising from the far shore, framed by a clear blue sky above. The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 765. Recinos 1986, p. 82. When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies. Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled.Recinos 1986, p. 82. The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. This battle took place on 18 April.Recinos 1986, p. 83. The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 765‚Äì766. Recinos 1986, p. 84. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain.Recinos 1986, p. 84. =Kaqchikel rebellion= Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.Schele & Mathews 1999, p. 298. He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 pesos.Guillemin 1967 p. 25.A peso was a Spanish coin. One peso was worth eight reales (the source of the term \\"pieces of eight\\") or two tostones. During the conquest, a peso contained of gold. Lovell 2005, p. 223. Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 52. n. 25. The Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524. Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel. Two years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the Ahpo Xahil, sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.Schele & Mathews 1999, pp. 298, 310, 386n19.Recinos 1998, p. 19. gives sixty deserters. The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years. On 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops,Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 92. the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. =Pacific lowlands of Guatemala= A page from the Lienzo de Tlaxcala depicting the conquest of Izcuintepeque. On 8 May 1524, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000,Most of these were native allies. where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque near Izcuintepeque on 9 May.Fowler 1985, p. 41. Recinos 1998, p. 29. Matthew 2012, p. 81. Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day. Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands. According to Alvarado's letter to Cort√©s, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord.Batres 2009, p. 65. The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days.Polo Sifontes 1981, p. 117. A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.Batres 2009, p. 66. The Pacific slope of Jutiapa was the scene of a number of battles with the Xinca. In Guazacap√°n, Pedro de Alvarado described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 5. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec.Letona Zuleta et al., p. 6. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.Recinos 1986, p. 87. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army.Recinos 1986, pp. 87‚Äì88. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa,Mendoza Asencio 2011, pp. 34-35. offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets. From Pazaco, Alvarado crossed the R√≠o Paz and entered what is now El Salvador.Recinos 1986, p. 88. Cuzcatlan (El Salvador) Alvarado led the first effort by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatlan (in modern El Salvador), in June 1524. These efforts established many towns such as San Jos√© Acatempa in 1525 and Esquipulas in 1560. Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people known as the Pipil and their Mayan speaking neighbors. Despite Alvarado's initial success in the Battle of Acajutla, the indigenous people of Cuzcatl√°n, who according to tradition were led by a warlord called Atlacatl, defeated the Spaniards and their auxiliaries, and forced them to withdraw to Guatemala. Alvarado was wounded on his left thigh, remaining handicapped for the rest of his life. He abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions were required (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) to bring the Pipil under Spanish control. In 1528 the conquest of Cuzcatl√°n was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. Titles and first marriage On 18 December 1527, the king of Spain named Alvarado as governor of Guatemala; two days later he granted him the coveted military title of Adelantado. Alvarado's close friendship with Cort√©s was broken in the same year; Alvarado had promised Cort√©s that he would marry Cecilia V√°zquez, Cortes' cousin. Alvarado broke his promise and instead married Francisca de la Cueva.Garc√≠a A√±overos 1987, p. 247. Technically, this was not his first marriage as he married an indigenous woman, daughter to Xicotencatl the Younger, who was referred to as Dona Luisa by Spanish speakers and Tlecuiluatzin by Nahuatl speakers. Francisca de la Cueva was well connected at the royal court, being the niece of Francisco de los Cobos, the king's secretary, and a member of the powerful noble house of Albuquerque. This marriage gave Alvarado extra leverage at court and was far more useful to his long term interests; Alvarado thereafter maintained a friendship with Francisco de los Cobos that allowed him access to the king's favour. In 1528, by coincidence both Alvarado and Cort√©s were in Seville at the same time, but Cort√©s ignored him. Francisca de la Cueva died shortly after their arrival in America. Alvarado remained governor of Guatemala until his death. He was made Knight of Santiago in 1527. Peru By 1532, Alvarado's friendship with Hern√°n Cort√©s had soured, and he no longer trusted him. At this time Alvarado requested permission from the king for an expedition south along the Pacific coast, to conquer any lands there that had not already been claimed for the Crown, and specifically rejected that Cort√©s should accompany him.Garc√≠a A√±overos 1987, p. 248. In 1534, Alvarado heard tales of the riches of Peru, headed south to the Andes and attempted to bring the province of Quito under his rule. When he arrived, he found the land already held by Francisco Pizarro's lieutenant Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar. The two forces of Conquistadors almost came to battle; however, Alvarado bartered to Pizarro's group most of his ships, horses, and ammunition, plus most of his men, for a comparatively modest sum of money, and returned to Guatemala. Governor of Honduras In 1532, Alvarado received a Royal Cedula naming him Governor of the Province of Honduras. At that time, Honduras consisted of a single settlement of Spaniards in Trujillo, but he declined to act on it. In 1533 or 1534 he began to send his own work gangs of enslaved Africans and Native Americans into the parts of Honduras adjacent to Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits. In 1536, ostensibly in response to a letter asking for aid from Andr√©s de Cereceda, then acting Governor of the Province of Honduras, Alvarado and his army of Indian allies arrived in Honduras, just as the Spanish colonists were preparing to abandon the country and go look for gold in Peru. In June, 1536, Alvarado engaged the indigenous resistance led by Cicumba in the lower Ulua river valley, and won. He divided up the Indian labor in repartimiento grants to his soldiers and some of the colonists, and returned to Guatemala. During a visit to Spain, in 1537, Alvarado had the governorship of Honduras reconfirmed in addition to that of Guatemala for the next seven years. His governorship of Honduras was not uncontested. Francisco de Montejo had a rival claim, and was installed by the Spanish king as Governor of Honduras in 1540. Ten years after being widowed, Alvarado married one of his first wife's sisters, Beatriz de la Cueva, who outlived him. After the death of Alvarado, de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times. She drowned a few days after taking office in the destruction of the capital city Ciudad Vieja by a sudden flow from the Volc√°n de Agua in 1541. Death in the Mixt√≥n War, 1541 Alvarado's death, depicted in the indigenous Codex Telleriano-Remensis. The glyph to the right of his head represents his Nahuatl name, Tonatiuh (\\"Sun\\"). Antigua cathedral, marking Pedro de Alvarado's tomb Alvarado developed a plan to outfit an armada that would sail from the western coast of Mexico to China and the Spice Islands. At great cost, he assembled and equipped 13 ships and approximately 550 soldiers for the expedition. The fleet was about to set sail in 1541 when Alvarado received a letter from Crist√≥bal de O√±ate, pleading for help against hostile Indians who were besieging him at Nochistl√°n.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, The siege was part of a major revolt by the Mixt√≥n natives of the Nueva Galicia region of Mexico. Alvarado gathered his troops and went to help O√±ate. In a freak accident, he was crushed by a horse that was spooked and ran amok. He died a few days later, on July 4, 1541, and was buried in the church at Tiripet√≠o, a village between P√°tzcuaro and Morelia (in present-day Michoac√°n). Four decades after Alvarado's death, his mestiza daughter Leonor de Alvarado Xicot√©ncatl paid to transport his remains to Guatemala for reburial in the cathedral of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, now Antigua Guatemala. Family After the death of her husband, Beatriz de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times. Alvarado had no children from either of his legal marriages. His life companion was his concubine Luisa de Tlaxcala (also called Xicot√©ncatl or Tecubalsi, her original names after Catholic baptism). She was a Nahua noblewoman, daughter of the Tlaxcallan King Xicotencatl the Elder. Luisa was given by her father in 1519 to Hern√°n Cort√©s as a proof of respect and friendship. In turn Cort√©s gave her in guard to Pedro de Alvarado, who quickly and unremarkably became her lover. Luisa followed Alvarado in his pursuit of conquests beyond central Mexico. Despite never being his legitimate wife, Luisa de Tlaxcala had numerous possessions and was respected as a Do√±a, both for her relationship with Alvarado and for her noble origin. She died in 1535 and was buried at the Guatemala Cathedral. With Luisa de Tlaxcala Pedro de Alvarado had three children: * Leonor de Alvarado y Xicotenga Tecubalsi, born in the newly founded Spanish city of Santiago de los Caballeros, who married Pedro de Portocarrero, a conqueror trusted by his father-in-law, whom he accompanied during the conquests of Mexico and Guatemala. Portocarrero participated in numerous battles against the Indians. : Leonor married a second time,According to the illustrious 17th- century historian father Domingo Juarros in his Compendio de la historia de la cuidad de guatemala, pagina 347. to Francisco de la Cueva y Guzman. The Alvarado fortune remained with their descendants for generations to come, in the family of Villacreces de la Cueva y Guzm√°n, governors of this part of Guatemala. * Pedro de Alvarado, named for his father, who disappeared at sea when traveling to Spain * Diego de Alvarardo, El Mestizo, who died in 1554 in the civil wars of Peru.

The son of a freedman and a freedwoman , Accius was born at Pisaurum in Umbria, in 170 BC. The year of his death is unknown, but he must have lived to a great age, since CiceroCicero, Brutus, 72-73 (born 106 BC, hence 64 years younger) writes of having conversed with him on literary matters. Literary works Accius was a prolific writer and enjoyed a very high reputation.Horace, Epistles, ii.i, 56; Cicero, Pro Plancio, 24 The titles and considerable fragments (about 700 lines) of some fifty plays have been preserved. Judging from the titles and fragments, scholars have surmised that most, if not all, of these poems were tragic in nature, although Pliny the Younger ranks him among the erotic poets.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae 5.6 His career as a poet can be traced over the course of 36 years from B.C. 140, to B.C. 104. Most of his poetical works were imitations or free translations of the Greek, especially Aeschylus. The earliest of these was most likely the Atreus, which was performed in 140, but is now lost.Cicero, Brutus 229 He also wrote on some Roman subjects, one of which, an examination of the tyranny of L. Tarquinius Superbus and his expulsion by Lucius Junius Brutus, was titled Brutus, and was probably written in honor of his patron D. Brutus.Cicero De Legibus. ii.21, Pro Archia Poeta. 11 His favorite subjects were the legends of the Trojan War and the house of Pelops. While only fragments remain, the most important of which were preserved by Cicero, they seem sufficient to justify the terms of admiration in which Accius is spoken of by the ancient writers. He is particularly praised for the strength and vigor of his language, and the sublimity of his thoughts.Cicero pro Plancio 24, pro Sestio 56, &c.; Horace Epodes ii.1.56; Quintilian x.1. ¬ß 97; Aulus Gellius xiii. 2 Although the grandiloquence of his literary style was on occasion mocked by some of his peers,Porph. Hor. Serm. 1.10.53 he continued to be cited by other writers long after his death. Accius wrote other works of a literary character: Libri Didascalicon, a treatise in verse on the history of Greek and Roman poetry, and dramatic art in particular; also Libri Pragmaticon, Parerga, and Praxidica, of which no fragments remain; and a hexameter Annales containing the history of Rome, like that of Ennius. As a grammarian Accius also attempted to introduce innovations in Latin orthography and grammar, most of which were attempts to change written Latin to more faithfully reproduce its actual pronunciation. Few of these caught on, although his preference against giving Greek names Latin endings had quite a few supporters, particularly Varro, who dedicated his De antiquitate litterarum to Accius.Varro, De lingua Latina 10.70 A spelling convention of writing long vowels double (such as aa for long ƒÅ) is also associated with him and is found in texts concurrent with his lifetime. Politics and temperament Accius was politically conservative, and generally noted for his dignity and reserve. He did, however, believe that one with literary gifts, such as himself, ought to be accorded more respect than someone who, through no effort of their own, was merely born into the nobility. He was, by some accounts, a self-important man,Rhetorica ad Herennium 1.24 and some writers expressed a wry amusement at the larger-than-life statues of himself that he had erected in the temple of the Muses.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 34.19 A fragment of Accius' play Atreus features the line oderint dum metuant (\\"let them hate, so long as they fear\\"), later an infamous motto of Caligula.

Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking. Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; Photochromatic glasses are clear or lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in they come in contact with ultraviolet light. Most over the counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made. People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary symptom ( like certain migraine disorders or Irlen syndrome often wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even indoors and at night. Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example 3D glasses for 3D films (stereoscopy). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials. People are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 wearing corrective lenses.  Types  Glasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification. = Corrective = Seattle skyline as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of refraction Corrective lenses are used to correct refractive errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which is caused by the eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a \\"stronger\\" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other. Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting. The most common type of corrective lens is \\"single vision\\", which has a uniform refractive index. For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, and so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For the total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. People who need glasses to see often have corrective lens restrictions on their driver's licenses that require them to wear their glasses every time they drive or risk fines or jail time. Some militaries issue prescription glasses to servicemen and women. These are typically GI glasses Many state prisons in the United States issue glasses to inmates, often in the form of clear plastic aviators. Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom- manufactured for every person). Pinhole glasses are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a diffraction limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small aperture in photography. This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a DIY fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms. = Safety = Safety glasses with side shields Safety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in various situations. They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full-sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called \\"flash goggles\\" because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protective eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes. = Sunglasses = Woman wearing sunglasses Sunglasses provide more comfort and protection against bright light and often against ultraviolet (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger. Photochromic lenses, which are photosensitive, darken when struck by UV light. The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens. Light polarization is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed. Liquid-crystal displays often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include tea shades and mirrorshades. Many blind people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons. Many people with light sensitivity conditions wear sunglasses or other tinted glasses to make the light more tolerable. Sunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription. Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses. Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses. Otherwise, many people opt to wear contact lenses to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used. = Mixed doubleframe = Doubleframe eyewear with one set of lenses on the moving frame and another pair of lenses on a fixed frame (optional). The double frame uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by four-bar linkage. For example, sun lenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with myopia lenses that always stay on. Presbyopia lenses could be also combined and easily removed from the field of view if needed without taking off glasses. = 3D glasses = The illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes. The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for. Anaglyph 3D glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A polarized 3D system on the other hand uses polarized filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An active shutter 3D system uses electronic shutters. Head-mounted displays can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewer's eyes. Anaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at 3D movies. Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters. Head- mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units. = Magnification (bioptics) = Glasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands. An example would be bioptics or bioptic telescopes which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble goggles or binoculars, or may be attached to existing glasses. = Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses = Yellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing eyestrain due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses. Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra- violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames. Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration. = Anti- glare protection glasses = Anti-glare protection glasses, or blue-light glasses, can reduce the reflection of light that enters our eyes. Blue-light blocking glasses are designed to filter or block blue light and reduce the eye strain from it, likely coming from electronic LED screens. The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By reducing the amount of glare on your eyes, vision can be improved. The anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.  Frames  Glasses, , with springy cable temples The ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses that is designed to hold the lenses in the proper position. Ophthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors. = Parts = * pair of eye wires or rims surrounding and holding the lenses in place * bridge which connects the two eye wires * chassis, the combination of the eye wires and the bridge * top bar or brow bar, a bar just above the bridge providing structural support and/or style enhancement (country/Grandpa style). The addition of a top bar makes a pair of glasses aviator eyeglasses * pair of brows or caps, plastic or metal caps which fit over the top of the eye wires for style enhancement and to provide additional support for the lenses. The addition of brows makes a pair of glasses browline glasses * pair of nose pads that allows a comfortable resting of the eye wires on the nose * pair of pad arms connect the nose pads to the eye wires * pair of temples (earpieces) on either side of the skull * pair of temple tips at the ends of the temples * pair of end pieces connect the eye wires via the hinges to the temples * pair of frame-front end pieces * pair of hinges connect the end pieces to the temples, allowing a swivel movement. Spring-loaded flex hinges are a variant that is equipped with a small spring that affords the temples a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90-degree angle. = Temple types = * Skull temples: bend down behind the ears, follow the contour of the skull and rest evenly against the skull * Library temples: generally straight and do not bend down behind the ears. Hold the glasses primarily through light pressure against the side of the skull * Convertible temples: used either as library or skull temples depending on the bent * Riding bow temples: curve around the ear and extend down to the level of the ear lobe. Used mostly on athletic, children's, and industrial safety frames; * Comfort cable temples: similar to the riding bow, but made from a springy cable of coiled metal, sometimes inside a plastic or silicone sleeve. The tightness of the curl can be adjusted along its whole length, allowing the frame to fit the wearer's ear curve perfectly. Used for physically active wearers, children, and people with high prescriptions (heavy lenses). See the image of 1920s frames above. = Materials =  Plastic and polymer  * Cellulose acetate * Optyl, a type of hypoallergenic material made especially for eyeglass frames. It features a type of elasticity that returns the material to its original shape. * Cellulose propionate, a molded, durable plastic * 3D-printed plastic using super-fine polyamide powder and Selective Laser Sintering processes ‚Äì see Mykita Mylon (The frames can be 3-D printed by fused filament fabrication for pennies of ABS, PLA or nylon) * Nylon  Metal  Various metals and alloys may be used to make glasses such as gold, silver, aluminum, beryllium, stainless steel, titanium, monel and nickel titanium.  Natural material  Also natural materials may be used such as wood, bone, ivory, leather and semi-precious or precious stones.  Corrective lens shape  Modern glasses with a rectangular lens shape Corrective lenses can be produced in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank. Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them. Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes. For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allow for many trendy and fashionable shapes. Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used. However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced. Bifocal, trifocal, and progressive lenses generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, rectangular or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.  History  = Precursors = Dominican Cardinal and renowned biblical scholar Hugh of Saint-Cher painted by Tommaso da Modena in 1352 Portrait of cardinal Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara by El Greco circa 1600 shows glasses with temples passing over and beyond the ears Scattered evidence exists for use of visual aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.The Natural History, Book 37, Chpt.16. Pliny the Elder. John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S. H.T. Riley, Esq., B.A. London. Taylor and Francis, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. 1855 The use of a convex lens to form an enlarged/magnified image was most likely described in Ptolemy's Optics (which however only survives in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by Ibn Sahl (10th century) and most notably by Alhazen (Book of Optics, ca. 1021). Latin translations of Ptolemy's Optics and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of \\"reading stones\\". Robert Grosseteste's treatise De iride (\\"On the Rainbow\\"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to \\"read the smallest letters at incredible distances\\". From Grant's English translation of Robert Grosseteste's De Iride (On the rainbow) in Latin, p. 389: \\"This part [viz, from Aristotle's supposed treatise on optics] of perspective, if perfectly understood, shows us how to make nearby objects appear very small, and how to make a small object placed at a distance appear as large as we wish, so that it would be possible to read minute letters from incredible distances or count sand, seeds, blades of grass, or any minute objects.\\" A few years later in 1262, Roger Bacon is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.Bacon, Roger; Burke, Robert Belle, trans. (1962) The Opus Majus of Roger Bacon (New York, New York, USA: Russell & Russell, Inc.) vol. 2. Part 5, Ch. IV, p. 582. From p. 582: \\"For we can so shape transparent bodies, and arrange them in such a way with respect to our sight and objects of vision, that the rays will be refracted and bent in any direction we desire, and under any angle, we wish we shall see the object near or at a distance. Thus from an incredible distance we might read the smallest letters and number grains of dust and sand ‚Ä¶ \\" The development of the first eyeglasses took place in Northern Italy in the second half of the 13th century. Independently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed \\"sunglasses\\" for eye protection, without any corrective properties. Thus, flat panes of smoky quartz, were used in 12th- century China. Similarly, the Inuit have used snow goggles for eye protection. = Invention = The Glasses Apostle by Conrad von Soest (1403) The first eyeglasses were made in Northern Italy, most likely in Pisa, by about 1290: In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar Giordano da Pisa (ca. 1255‚Äì1311) wrote \\"It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered. ... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him.\\" Giordano's colleague Friar Alessandro della Spina of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa records: \\"Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart.\\" By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses. In the fourteenth century they were very common objects: Francesco Petrarca says in one of his letters that, until he was 60, he didn't need glasses,Petrarch (Franciscus Petrarca) mentions eyeglasses in his Epistola ad Posteros (Letter to Posterity): * \\" ‚Ä¶ colore vivido inter candidum et subnigrum, vivacibus oculis et visu per longum tempus acerrimo, qui preter spem supra sexagesimum etatis annum me destituit, ut indignanti michi ad ocularium confugiendum esset auxilium.\\" * English translation: \\"I was possessed of a clear complexion, between light and dark, lively eyes, and for long years a keen vision, which however deserted me, contrary to my hopes, after I reached my sixtieth birthday, and forced me, to my great annoyance, to resort to glasses.\\" and Franco Sacchetti mentions them often in his Trecentonovelle. Seated apostle holding lenses in position for reading. Detail from Death of the Virgin, by the Master of Heiligenkreuz, ca. 1400‚Äì30 (Getty Center). scissors glasses (with one lens missing), The earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is Tommaso da Modena's 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had convex lenses that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the presbyopia that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. It was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and myopia. Early frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses riveted together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as \\"rivet spectacles\\". The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at Kloster Wienhausen, a convent near Celle in Germany; they have been dated to circa 1400. The world's first spectacle specialist shop opened in Strasbourg (then Holy Roman Empire, now France) in 1466.  Other claims  The 17th century claim, by Francesco Redi, that Salvino degli Armati of Florence invented eyeglasses, in the 13th century, has been exposed as erroneous. Marco Polo is sometimes claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such statement appears in his accounts. Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported. In 1907 Professor Berthold Laufer speculated, in his history of glasses, that for glasses to be mentioned in the literature of China and Europe at approximately the same time it was probably that they were not invented independently, and after ruling out the Turks, proposed India as a location.Laufer, Berthold (1907) \\"Geschichte der Brille\\" (History of eyeglasses), Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften (Communications on the History of Medicine and the Sciences), 6 (4) : 379-385. However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the Chinese manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty. In 1971 Rishi Agarwal, in an article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, states that Vyasatirtha was observed in possession a pair of glasses in the 1520s, he argues that it: \\"...is, therefore, most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Sushruta\\",Agarwal, R. K. (1971) \\"Origin of spectacles in India,\\" British Journal of Ophthalmology, 55 (2) : 128-129. Available online at: National Center for Biotechnology Information but all dates are given well after the existence of eyeglasses in Italy was established, and there had been significant shipments of eyeglasses from Italy to the Middle East, with one shipment as large as 24,000 glasses.Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes, Vincent Ilardi, American Philosophical Society 2007 pages 118 - 125 = Later developments = A portrait of Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas, 1580‚Äì1645 Harry S. Truman, 33rd President of the United States, was known to have poor vision. The American scientist Benjamin Franklin, who suffered from both myopia and presbyopia, invented bifocals. Historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825. Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (pince-nez). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as \\"scissors-glasses\\" and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century. In the early 20th century, Moritz von Rohr and Zeiss (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, Joshua Silver designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism. Despite the increasing popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offer dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times. =In fashion= In the 1930s, \\"spectacles\\" were described as \\"medical appliances.\\" Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. In the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and governments also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear. Graham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible. In the past, design for disability has \\"been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all.\\" Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for \\"patients\\", and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory. Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer. It is becoming more common for consumers to purchase eyewear with clear, non-prescription lenses, illustrating that glasses are no longer a social stigma, but a fashionable accessory that \\"frames your face.\\" Society and culture =Market= The market for spectacles has been characterized as having highly inelastic demand, and advertising restrictions in the USA have correlated with higher prices, suggesting that adverts make the spectacles market more price- competitive. It may also be monopolistically competitive. There are claims that insufficiently free market competition inflates the prices of frames, which cost an average of $25-$50 US to make, to an average retail price of $300 in the United States. This claim is disputed by some in the industry. = Redistribution = Some organizations like Lions Clubs International, Unite For Sight, ReSpectacle, and New Eyes for the Needy provide a way to donate glasses and sunglasses to people on low incomes or no income. Unite For Sight has redistributed more than 200,000 Pairs. = Fashion = Glasses - Decoration, Presi HQ, Budapest Many people require glasses for the reasons listed above. There are many shapes, colors, and materials that can be used when designing frames and lenses that can be utilized in various combinations. Oftentimes, the selection of a frame is made based on how it will affect the appearance of the wearer. Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory. In Japan, some companies ban women from wearing glasses.  Personal image  For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses), elderly, or physically weak and passive. The stigma began to fall away in the United States of America in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd began wearing a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the \\"Glasses\\" character in his films. In the United Kingdom, wearing glasses was characterised in the nineteenth century, as \\"a sure sign of the weakling and the mollycoddle\\", according to Neville Cardus, writing in 1928.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/07/tim-killick-bespectacled- rogue-clattered-34-in-an-over-the-spin-cricket \\"Tim\\" Killick was the first professional cricketer to play while wearing glasses \\"continuously\\", after his vision deteriorated in 1897. \\"With their aid he placed himself in the forefront among English professionals of all-round abilities.‚Äù Former United States senator Barry Goldwater in horn-rimmed glasses Since eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals' personal image. Musicians Buddy Holly and John Lennon became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called \\"Buddy Holly glasses\\" and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called \\"John Lennon (or Harry Potter) Glasses.\\" British comedic actor Eric Sykes was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were, in fact, a sophisticated hearing aid that alleviated his deafness by allowing him to \\"hear\\" vibrations. Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking alternate measures against vision problems: United States Senator Barry Goldwater and comedian Drew Carey continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for contacts and getting laser eye surgery, respectively. Other celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses with thick plastic frames like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to actor Jaleel White's infamous styling as TV character Steve Urkel. In superhero fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero personae: Superman is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear glasses are intelligent. This belief can have positive consequences for people who wear glasses, for example in elections. Studies show that wearing glasses increases politicians‚Äô electoral success, at least in Western cultures.

Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic devices used by over 150 million people worldwide, and they can be worn to correct vision or for cosmetic or therapeutic reasons. In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at $2.1 billion.Nichols, Jason J., et al \\"ANNUAL REPORT: Contact Lenses 2010\\".

Contact Lens Spectrum. October 2011. People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons.Agarwal, R. K. (1969), Contact Lens Notes, Some factors concerning patients' motivation, The Optician, 10 January, pages 32-33 (published in London, England). Aesthetics and cosmetics are the main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.  History  = Origins and first functional prototypes = Artist's impression of da Vinci's method for neutralizing the refractive power of the cornea Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses in his 1508 Codex of the eye, Manual D, wherein he described a method of directly altering corneal power by either submerging the head in a bowl of water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically implementable in da Vinci's time. He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision; he was more interested in exploring mechanisms of accommodation.Heitz, RF and Enoch, J. M. (1987) \\"Leonardo da Vinci: An assessment on his discourses on image formation in the eye.\\" Advances in Diagnostic Visual Optics 19‚Äî26, Springer-Verlag. Descartes proposed a device for correcting vision consisting of a liquid-filled glass tube capped with a lens. However, the idea was impracticable, since the device was to be placed in direct contact with the cornea and thus would have made blinking impossible. In 1801, Thomas Young fashioned a pair of basic contact lenses based on Descartes' model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses to his eyes, neutralizing their refractive power, which he corrected with another pair of lenses. However his device was not intended to correct refraction errors. Sir John Herschel, in a footnote to the 1845 edition of the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first \\"a spherical capsule of glass filled with animal jelly\\", the second \\"a mould of the cornea\\" that could be impressed on \\"some sort of transparent medium\\".\\"The History of Contact Lenses.\\" eyeTopics.com. Accessed 18 October 2006. Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were later advanced by independent inventors, including Hungarian physician Joseph Dallos, who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes. This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye. In 1888, Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick was the first to successfully fit contact lenses, which were made from blown glass Although Louis J. Girard invented a scleral contact lens in 1887, it was German ophthalmologist Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick who in 1888 fabricated the first successful afocal scleral contact lens. Approximately in diameter, the heavy blown-glass shells rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue surrounding the cornea and floated on a dextrose solution. He experimented with fitting the lenses initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers, publishing his work, \\"Contactbrille\\", in the March 1888 edition of Archiv f√ºr Augenheilkunde. Large and unwieldy, Fick's lens could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time. August M√ºller of Kiel, Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888. The development of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in the 1930s paved the way for the manufacture of plastic scleral lenses. In 1936, optometrist William Feinbloom introduced a hybrid lens composed of glass and plastic,Robert B. Mandell. Contact Lens Practice, 4th Edition. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL, 1988. while in 1939, Hungarian optometrist Dr Istv√°n Gy√∂rffy produced the first fully plastic contact lens. The following year, German optometrist Heinrich W√∂hlk produced his own version of plastic lenses based on experiments performed during the 1930s.Contact Lens History: How Contact Lenses Have Developed Through the Years. EyeHealth Central. Retrieved from https://www.contactlenses.co.uk/education/history.htm = Corneal and rigid lenses (1949‚Äì1960s) = In 1949, the first \\"corneal\\" lenses were developed.U.S. Patent No. 2,510,438, filed 28 February 1948.\\"The Corneal Lens\\", The Optician, 2 September 1949, pp. 141‚Äì144.\\"Corneal Contact Lenses\\", The Optician, 9 September 1949, p. 185.\\"New Contact Lens Fits Pupil Only\\", The New York Times, 11 February 1952, p. 27. These were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface, and could be worn up to 16 hours a day. PMMA corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with improving manufacturing technology. On October 18, 1964, in a television studio in Washington, D.C., Lyndon Baines Johnson became the first President in the history of the United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Isen, who developed the first commercially viable soft-contact lenses in the United States. Early corneal lenses of the 1950s and 1960s were relatively expensive and fragile, resulting in the development of a market for contact lens insurance. Replacement Lens Insurance, Inc. (now known as RLI Corp.) phased out its original flagship product in 1994 after contact lenses became more affordable and easier to replace. = Gas permeable and soft lenses (1959-current) = One major disadvantage of PMMA lenses is that they allow no oxygen to get through to the conjunctiva and cornea, causing a number of adverse and potentially serious clinical effects. By the end of the 1970s and through the 1980s and 1990s, a range of oxygen-permeable but rigid materials were developed to overcome this problem. Chemist Norman Gaylord played a prominent role in the development of these new oxygen-permeable contact lenses. Collectively, these polymers are referred to as rigid gas permeable or RGP materials or lenses. Though all the above contact lens types‚Äîsclerals, PMMAs and RGPs‚Äîcould be correctly referred to as \\"rigid\\" or \\"hard\\", the latter term is now used to the original PMMAs, which are still occasionally fitted and worn, whereas \\"rigid\\" is a generic term for all these lens types; thus hard lenses (PMMAs) are a subset of rigid contact lenses. Occasionally, the term \\"gas permeable\\" is used to describe RGPs, which is somewhat misleading as soft contact lenses are also gas permeable in that they allow oxygen to get through to the ocular surface. Otto Wichterle (pictured) and Drahoslav L√≠m introduced modern soft hydrogel lenses in 1959. The principal breakthrough in soft lenses was made by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav L√≠m, who published their work \\"Hydrophilic gels for biological use\\" in the journal Nature in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to the launch of the first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses. In 1998, the first silicone hydrogel contact lenses were released by Ciba Vision in Mexico. These new materials encapsulated the benefits of silicone‚Äîwhich has extremely high oxygen permeability‚Äîwith the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels that had been used for the previous 30 years. These contact lenses were initially advocated primarily for extended (overnight) wear, although more recently, daily (no overnight) wear silicone hydrogels have been launched. In a slightly modified molecule, a polar group is added without changing the structure of the silicone hydrogel. This is referred to as the Tanaka monomer because it was invented and patented by Kyoichi Tanaka of Menicon Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal wetting agent. Comfilcon A (Biofinity, CooperVision) was the first third-generation polymer. Its patent claims that the material uses two siloxy macromers of different sizes that, when used in combination, produce very high oxygen permeability (for a given water content). Enfilcon A (Avaira, CooperVision) is another third-generation material that is naturally wettable; its water content is 46%.  Types  Contact lenses are classified in many different ways: by their primary function, material, wear schedule (how long a lens can be worn), and replacement schedule (how long before a lens needs to be discarded). = Functions =  Correction of refractive error  Corrective contact lenses are designed to improve vision, most commonly by correcting refractive error. This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper power for clear vision. A spherical contact lens bends light evenly in every direction (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia. There are two ways that contact lenses can correct astigmatism. One way is with toric soft lenses that work essentially the same way as eyeglasses with cylindrical correction; a toric lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, and as a result can correct for astigmatism. Another way is by using a rigid gas permeable lens; since most astigmatism is caused by the shape of the cornea, rigid lenses can improve vision because the front surface of the optical system is the perfectly spherical lens. Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Toric lenses must have the proper orientation to correct for astigmatism, so such lenses must have additional design characteristics to prevent them from rotating out of alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position, but these mechanisms rarely work perfectly, so some misalignment is common and results in somewhat imperfect correction, and blurring of sight after blinking rotates the lens. Toric soft lenses have all the advantages of soft lenses in general, which are low initial cost, ease of fitting, and minimal adjustment period. Rigid gas permeable lenses usually provide superior optical correction, but have become less popular relative to soft lenses due to higher initial costs, longer initial adjustment period, and more involved fitting.  Correction of presbyopia  Correction of presbyopia (a need for a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision. Multifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses). Monovision is the use of single-vision lenses (one focal point per lens) to focus an eye (typically the dominant one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses.  Other types of vision correction  For those with certain color deficiencies, a red-tinted \\"X-Chrom\\" contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal color vision, it allows some color-blind people to distinguish colors better. Red-filtering contact lenses can also be an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as achromatopsia.http://www.achromatopsia.info/red-contact-lenses/ Red contact lenses for achromats ChromaGen contact lenses have been used and shown to have some limitations with vision at night although otherwise producing significant improvements in color vision. An earlier study showed very significant improvements in color vision and patient satisfaction.Harris D \\"Colouring Sight: A study of CL fittings with colour enhancing lenses\\" 'Optician' 8 June 1997 Later work that used these ChromaGen lenses with dyslexics in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed highly significant improvements in reading ability over reading without the lenses.Harris DA, MacRow-Hill SJ \\"Application of ChromaGen haploscopic lenses to patients with dyslexia: a double masked placebo controlled trial\\" Journal of the American Optometric Association 25/10/99. This system has been granted FDA approval for use in the United States. Magnification is another area being researched for future contact lens applications. Embedding of telescopic lenses and electronic components suggests that future uses of contact lenses may become extremely diverse.  Cosmetic contact lenses  Woman wearing a cosmetic type of contact lens; enlarged detail shows the grain produced during the manufacturing process. Curving of the lines of printed dots suggests these lenses were manufactured by printing onto a flat sheet then shaping it. A cosmetic contact lens is designed to change the appearance of the eye. These lenses may also correct refractive error. Although many brands of contact lenses are lightly tinted to make them easier to handle, cosmetic lenses worn to change eye color are far less common, accounting for only 3% of contact lens fits in 2004.Morgan PB et al.\\"International Contact Lens Prescribing in 2004: An analysis of more than 17,000 contact lens fits from 14 countries in 2004 reveals the diversity of contact lens practice worldwide.\\" Contact Lens Spectrum. January 2005. In the United States, the FDA labels non-corrective cosmetic contact lenses as decorative contact lenses. Like any contact lens, cosmetic lenses carry risks of mild to serious complications, including ocular redness, irritation and infection.Vanderbilt University Medical Center ‚Äì Vanderbilt Eye Doctors Warn of the Dangers of Cosmetic Contact Lenses. Mc.vanderbilt.edu (19 April 2010). Retrieved on 2013-07-21. Due to their medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to purchase in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but they still need their eyes to be measured for a \\"plano\\" prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.\\"Color Contacts\\". colorfuleyes.org. February 2016. Some colored contact lenses completely cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting its natural colour. A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend the appearance of the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes. One of the drawbacks of cosmetic lenses is not knowing how they will look before physically trying them on. This has led to an industry where lens retailers are heavily influenced by digital fashion technology, specifically the Virtual Dressing Room technology. This technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how they will look before committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes. Cosmetic lenses can have more direct medical applications. For example, some contact lenses can restore the appearance and, to some extent the function, of a damaged or missing iris.  Therapeutic scleral lenses  Scleral lens, with visible outer edge resting on the sclera of a patient with severe dry eye syndrome A scleral lens is a large, firm, transparent, oxygen-permeable contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (anesthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.  Therapeutic soft lenses  Soft lenses are often used in the treatment and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens allows the patient to see while protecting an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids, thereby allowing it to heal. They are used in the treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasia, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed. = Materials = Contact lenses, other than the cosmetic variety, become almost invisible once inserted in the eye. Most corrective contact lenses come with a light \\"handling tint\\" that renders the lens slightly more visible on the eye. Soft contact lenses extend beyond the cornea, their rim sometimes visible against the sclera.  Rigid lenses  Glass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as \\"hard\\" lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'. A rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the cornea with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with keratoconus or post surgical ectasias. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through glasses. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments than soft lenses.  Soft lenses  Soft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses, and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort. Hydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea. As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea. In 1998, silicone hydrogel, or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.FDA Premarket Notification for \\"new silicone hydrogel lens for daily wear\\" 'July 2008. Disadvantages of silicone hydrogels are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less \\"wettable\\" ‚Äì factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface's hydrophobic nature. Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic. A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents. Current brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel. Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses.  Hybrid  A small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft \\"skirt\\". A similar technique is the \\"piggybacking\\" of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens. = Wear schedule = A \\"daily wear\\" (DW) contact lens is designed to be worn for one day and removed before sleeping. An \\"extended wear\\" (EW) contact lens is designed for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as \\"continuous wear\\" (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid. A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5‚Äì6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids. Wearing lenses designed for daily wear overnight has an increased risk for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and corneal neovascularization‚Äîthis latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens. = Replacement schedule = Contact lenses are often categorized by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because they do not have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance. Other disposable contact lenses are designed for replacement every two or four weeks. Quarterly or annual lenses, which used to be very common, are now much less so. Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and may last for several years without the need for replacement. PMMA hards were very durable and were commonly worn for 5 to 10 years, but had several drawbacks. Lenses with different replacement schedules can be made of the same material. Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a \\"daily disposable\\" or one recommended for two or four week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them with different labels.  Manufacturing  Typically, soft contact lenses are mass-produced, while rigids are custom-made to exact specifications for the individual patient. *Spin-cast lenses ‚Äì A soft lens manufactured by whirling liquid silicone in a revolving mold at high speed.Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990. *Diamond turning ‚Äì This type is cut and polished on a CNC lathe. The lens starts out as a cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material from the inside of the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut and polished by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced. *Molded ‚Äì Molding is used to manufacture some brands of soft contact lenses. Rotating molds are used and the molten material is added and shaped by centripetal forces. Injection molding and computer control are also used to create nearly perfect lenses.Manufacture of soft contact lenses. \\"Manufacture of soft contact lenses\\". The lens is kept moist throughout the entire molding process and is never dried and rehydrated. Many companies make contact lenses. In the United States, there are five major manufacturers:Federal Trade Commission. \\"The Strength of Competition in the Sale of Rx Contact Lenses: An FTC Study\\". February 2005. *Johnson & Johnson; maker of Acuvue lenses *The Cooper Companies: through its CooperVision *Alcon *Bausch Health: through its Bausch & Lomb subsidiary *X-Cel Specialty Contacts; maker of Westcon lenses.  Prescriptions  Diameter and base curve radius The parameters specified in a contact lens prescription may include: *Material / Brand name *Base curve radius (BC, BCR) *Diameter (D, OAD) *Power in diopters *Center thickness (CT) Prescriptions for contact lenses and glasses may be similar, but are not interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually restricted to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination is needed to determine an individual's suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye's anterior segment. Many eye diseases prohibits contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye.Agarwal, R.K. (1970), Some reasons for not fitting contact lenses, The Optician, 4 December, page 623 (published in London, England). Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses. = United States = Contact lenses are prescribed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, or specially licensed opticians under the supervision of an eye doctor. Contact lenses can typically be ordered at the office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act\\"Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act\\". 15 October 2003. gives consumers the right to obtain a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to fill it at the lens provider of their choice.  Complications  CLARE (contact lens associated red eye) is a group of inflammatory complications from lens wear Contact lenses are generally safe as long as they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly.John Stamler. \\"Contact Lens Complications.\\" eMedicine.com. 1 September 2004. Factors leading to eye damage varies, and improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, and, most of all, the whole structure of the cornea. Poor lens care can lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and Acanthamoeba (Acanthamoeba keratitis). Many complications arise when contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear is a common cause of complications. Many people go too long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save on the cost of lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight. One of the major factors that causes complications is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long- term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens. Mishandling of contact lenses can also cause problems. Corneal abrasions can increase the chances of infection. When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased corneal sensitivity after extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss some of the earliest symptoms of such complications. The way contact lenses interact with the natural tear layer is a major factor in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects. Long-term wear (over five years) of contact lenses may \\"decrease the entire corneal thickness and increase the corneal curvature and surface irregularity.\\" Long-term wear of rigid contacts is associated with decreased corneal keratocyte density and increased number of epithelial Langerhans cells. All contact lenses sold in the United States are studied and approved as safe by the FDA when specific handling and care procedures, wear schedules, and replacement schedules are followed.  Usage  Before touching the contact lens or the eye, it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation. Drying of hands using towels or tissues before handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, before handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, before opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion. Care should be taken to ensure the soft lens is not inserted inside-out. The edge of a lens turned inside out has a different appearance, especially when the lens is slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens for a brief time (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens apart from the back. = Insertion = Inserting a contact lens Contact lenses are typically inserted into the eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may be placed on the sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye. When the lens first contacts the eye, it should be comfortable. A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, taking a break from lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications. = Removal = Young woman removing contact lenses from her eyes in front of a mirror Removing contact lenses incorrectly can result in damage to the lens and injury to the eye, so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins against the edge of lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable. A soft contact lens may be removed by pinching the edge between the thumb and index finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball to get it to fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea. There are also small tools specifically for removing lenses. Usually made of flexible plastic, they resemble small tweezers, or plungers that suction onto the front of the lens. Typically, these tools are used only with rigid lenses. Extreme care must be exercised when using mechanical tools or fingernails to insert or remove contact lenses. = Care = Lens case to store contacts Contact lenses soaking in a hydrogen peroxide-based solution. The case is part of a \\"one-step\\" system and includes a catalytic disc at the base to neutralise the peroxide over time. Lens care varies depending on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and disinfecting to prevent surface coating and infections. There are many ways to clean and care for contact lenses, typically called care systems or lens solutions: *Multipurpose solutions ::Multipurpose solutions are the most common method for rinsing, disinfecting, cleaning, and storing soft lenses. In 2002, concerns were raised that multipurpose solutions are not effective at disinfecting Acanthamoeba from the lens. In May 2007, one brand of multipurpose solution was recalled due to a cluster of Acanthamoeba infections.Early Report of Serious Eye Infections Associated with Soft Contact Lens Solution . CDC health advisory. 25 May 2007. CDCHAN-00260-2007-05-25-ADV-NAcanthamoeba Keratitis - Multiple States, 2005‚Äì2007. Center for Disease Control MMWR dispatch. 26 May 2007 / 56(Dispatch);1‚Äì3 Since then, studies showed that multipurpose solutions are ineffective against Acanthamoebae. The latest multipurpose solutions also contain ingredients that improve the surface wettability and comfort of silicone hydrogel lenses.Fejzaj, Klaudio Modern Silicone-Hydrogel Contact Lenses *Hydrogen peroxide systems ::Hydrogen peroxide can be used to disinfect contact lenses. Care should be taken not to get hydrogen peroxide in the eye because it is very painful and irritating. With \\"two-step\\" products, the hydrogen peroxide must be rinsed away with saline before the lenses may be worn. \\"One-step\\" systems allow the hydrogen peroxide to react completely, becoming pure water. Thus \\"one-step\\" hydrogen peroxide systems do not require the lenses to be rinsed before insertion, provided the solution has been given enough time to react. An exposure time of 2-3 hours to 3% (non neutralized solution) is sufficient to kill bacteria, HIV, fungi, and Acanthamoeba. This can be achieved by using a \\"two-step\\" product or a \\"one-step\\" tablet system if the catalytic tablet isn't added before 2-3 hours. However, the \\"one-step\\" catalytic disk systems are not effective against Acanthamoeba. *Enzymatic cleaner ‚Äì Used for cleaning protein deposits off lenses, usually weekly, if the daily cleaner is not sufficient. Typically, this cleaner is in tablet form. *Ultraviolet, vibration, or ultrasonic devices ‚Äì Used to both disinfect and clean CLs. The lenses are inserted inside the portable device (running on batteries and/or plug-in) for 2 to 6 minutes during which both the microorganisms and protein build-up are thoroughly cleaned. These devices are not usually available in optic retailers but are in other stores. *Saline solution ::Sterile saline is used for rinsing the lens after cleaning and preparing it for insertion. Saline solutions do not disinfect, so it must be used in conjunction with some type of disinfection system. One advantage to saline is that it cannot cause an allergic response, so it is well suited for individuals with sensitive eyes or strong allergies. *Daily cleaner ::Used to clean lenses on a daily basis. A few drops of cleaner are applied to the lens while it rests in the palm of the hand; the lens is rubbed for about 20 seconds with a clean fingertip (depending on the product) on each side. Lens must then be rinsed. This system is commonly used to care for rigid lenses. Aside from cleaning the contact lenses, it is highly advised to also clean the cases to avoid any possible infection. Replacing the case monthly, and storing it in a clean and safe environment is also recommended. Contact lenses can be mechanically cleaned of more substantial protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and the palm of a hand, using a small amount of cleaning fluid as a lubricant. However, this method does not sterilize the lenses and so should be performed only before a full sterilization cycle (e.g. when putting the contact lens away at night). Some products must be used only with certain types of contact lenses. Water alone will not at all disinfect the lens, and can lead to lens contamination causing potentially irreparable harm to the eye. Contact lens solutions often contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol. Preservative- free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are better suited for individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal was used as a preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.  Current research  Contact lens sensors to monitor the ocular temperature were recently demonstrated. A large segment of current contact lens research is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend to agree that the most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial keratitis and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Robertson, DM, Petroll, WM, Jester, JV & Cavanagh, HD: Current concepts: contact lens related Pseudomonas keratitis. Cont Lens Anterior Eye, 30: 94‚Äì107, 2007. Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial keratitis associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the Staphylococcus species (aureus and epidermidis) and the Streptococcus species, among others.Sharma, S, Kunimoto, D, Rao, N, Garg, P & Rao, G: Trends in antibiotic resistance of corneal pathogens: Part II. An analysis of leading bacterial keratitis isolates, 1999. Microbial keratitis is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.Burd EM, Ogawa GSH, Hyndiuk RA. Bacterial keratitis and conjunctivitis. In: Smolin G, Thoft RA, editors. The Cornea. Scientific Foundations and Clinical Practice. 3rd ed. Boston: Little, Brown, & Co, 1994. p 115‚Äì67. One specific research topic of interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility,Sweeney DF, Keay L, Jalbert I. Clinical performance of silicone hydrogel lenses. In Sweeney DF, ed. Silicone Hydrogels: The Rebirth of Continuous Wear Contact Lenses. Woburn, Ma: Butterworth Heinemann; 2000. they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft contact lenses. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel contact lenses showed that worn silicone contact lenses were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses. Besides bacterial adhesion and cleaning, micro and nano pollutants (biological and manmade) is an area of contact lens research that is growing. Small physical pollutants ranging from nanoplastics to fungi spores to plant pollen adhere to contact lens surfaces in high concentrations. It has been found that multipurpose solution and rubbing with fingers does not significantly clean the lenses. A group of researchers have suggested an alternative cleaning solution, PoPPR (polymer on polymer pollution removal). This cleaning technique takes advantage of a soft and porous polymer to physically peal pollutants off of contact lenses. Another important area of contact lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue pertaining to the use of contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both. However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of \\"compliance\\" or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating microbial contamination are currently being developed. A silver-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case. Additionally, a number of antimicrobial agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached selenium molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye and octyl glucoside used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion. These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization. A recent area of research is in the field of bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light- emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer's eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers. Drug administration through contact lenses is also becoming an area of research. One application is a lens that releases anesthesia to the eye for post-surgery pain relief, especially after PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) in which the healing process takes several days. One experiment shows that silicone contact lenses that contain vitamin E deliver pain medication for up to seven days compared with less than two hours in usual lenses. Another study of the usage of contact lens is aimed to address the issue of macular degeneration (AMD or age-related macular degeneration). An international collaboration of researchers was able to develop a contact lens that can shift between magnified and normal vision. Previous solutions to AMD included bulky glasses or surgical implants. But the development this new contact lens, which is made of polymethyl methacrylate, could offer an unobtrusive solution.  In popular culture  Christopher Lee as the title character in Dracula (1958) in one of the first uses of contact lens with makeup in films =Films= One of the earliest known motion pictures to introduce the use of contact lenses as a make-up artist's device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor Lon Chaney in the 1926 film The Road to Mandalay to create the effect of a character who had a blind eye. Dr. Rueben Greenspoon applied them to Orson Welles for the film Citizen Kane in 1940. In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor Christopher Lee as the Dracula character in the 1958 color horror film Dracula, which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black pupils and red bloodshot eyes. Tony Curtis wore them in the 1968 film The Boston Strangler. Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968's Rosemary's Baby and 1973's The Exorcist. Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.  See also   References   Further reading  * Efron, Nathan (2002). Contact Lens Practice.

The Greek prefix \\"geo\\" means \\"earth\\" and the Greek suffix, \\"graphy,\\" meaning \\"description,\\" so a geographer is someone who studies the earth. The word \\"geography\\" is a Middle French word that is believed to have been first used in 1540. Although geographers are historically known as people who make maps, map making is actually the field of study of cartography, a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to human society and how human society affects the natural environment. In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society. Modern geographers are the primary practitioners of the GIS (geographic information system), who are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms. The paintings by Johannes Vermeer titled The Geographer and The Astronomer are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668‚Äì69.  Areas of study  There are three major fields of study, which are further subdivided: * Physical geography: including geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, biogeography, climatology, meteorology, pedology, oceanography, geodesy, and environmental geography. * Human geography: including Urban geography, cultural geography, economic geography, political geography, historical geography, marketing geography, health geography, and social geography. * Regional geography: including atmosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere The National Geographic Society identifies five broad key themes for geographers: * location * place * human-environment interaction * movement *regions  See also  *Geography *Human geography *List of geographers *Outline of geography *Physical geography *Geographers on Film  References   Further reading  * Steven Seegel.

Shot primarily in 1972 and 1973, it was originally submitted by Burnett to the UCLA School of Film in 1977 as his Master of Fine Arts thesis. It features Henry G. Sanders, Kaycee Moore, and Charles Bracy, among others, in acting roles. The film depicts the culture of urban African-Americans in Los Angeles' Watts district in a style often likened to Italian neorealism. Critic Dana Stevens described its plot as \\"a collection of brief vignettes which are so loosely connected that it feels at times like you're watching a non-narrative film.\\"\\"Black Sheep: A legendary film from 1977 gets its due.\\" by Dana Stevens, Slate.com, March 30, 2007 There are no acts, plot arcs or character development, as conventionally defined. Killer of Sheep premiered at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York on November 14, 1978. It did not receive a general release because Burnett had not secured rights to the music used in its production. The music rights were purchased in 2007 for US $150,000 and the film was restored and transferred from a 16mm to a 35mm print. Killer of Sheep received a limited release 30 years after it was completed, with a DVD release in late 2007. The film was restored by the UCLA preservationist Ross Lipman and produced on DVD by Steven Soderbergh and Milestone Films. In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Stan works long hours at a slaughterhouse in Watts, Los Angeles. The monotonous slaughter affects his home life with his unnamed wife and his two children, Stan Jr. and Angela. Through a series of confusing episodic events‚Äîsome friends try to involve Stan in a criminal plot, a white woman propositions Stan to work in her store, Stan and his friend Bracy attempt to buy a car engine‚Äîa mosaic of an austere working-class life emerges in which Stan feels unable to affect the course of his life. Cast *Henry G. Sanders as Stan *Kaycee Moore as Stan's wife *Charles Bracy as Bracy *Angela Burnett as Stan's daughter *Eugene Cherry as Eugene *Jack Drummond as Stan's son Production Directed by Charles Burnett, Killer of Sheep was shot in Watts on a budget of less than US$10,000 ($38,000 in 2016 dollars) over roughly a year's worth of weekends in 1972 and 1973, with additional shooting in 1975. In 1977, Burnett submitted the film as his Master of Fine Arts thesis at the School of Film at the University of California, Los Angeles. Burnett said he also intended to make the film a history of African-American music and filled it with music from a variety of genres and different eras.'Killer of Sheep' by Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times, April 6, 2007 Burnett also kept a stable job while Killer of Sheep was being shot, spending his time working at an agency reading scripts and synopsis.  Roof jumping scene  One scene contains a low-angle shot of children leaping from rooftop to rooftop. Juliet Clark, a journalist writing for the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, said the scene shows how children in the film \\"seem to achieve a mobility that eludes their elders\\". In 2009, a still from the scene, showing one of the boys mid-jump, was reproduced in red tint and used as the cover of rapper Mos Def's album The Ecstatic. According to Complex magazine's Dale Eisinger, the \\"subtle and still-moving\\" cover has a \\"hazy, dream-like movement, appearing as a non- narrative, loose collection of vignettes that are tangentially fascinating and incredibly powerful\\", while reflecting the ideas of cultural justice and global inequality present throughout Mos Def's work. Critical reception Though the film won the Critics' Award at the Berlin International Film Festival and was acclaimed at the Toronto International Film Festival, it never saw wide release due to complications in securing the music rights for the 22 songs on the soundtrack, which included such big names as Dinah Washington, Paul Robeson, Louis Armstrong, and Earth, Wind and Fire. It remained in obscurity for nearly 30 years, garnering much critical and academic praise and earning a reputation as a lost classic. The film did not win an award until four years after it came out, after having to wait four years for it to be released. Killer of Sheep holds a 97% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: \\"By turns funny, sad, and profound, Killer of Sheep offers a sympathetic and humane glimpse into inner-city life.\\" Retrieved February 11, 2014 Critics and scholars have likened the film to the work of Italian neorealist directors, particularly Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini, for its documentary aesthetic and use of mostly non- professional, on-location actors. Burnett has also been compared to Yasujir≈ç Ozu for his strong sense of composition, Stanley Kubrick for his sharp ear for juxtaposing popular music with images, John Cassavetes for his knack for coaxing natural performances from amateur actors, and Robert Altman for his interest in the minutiae of human interaction. Burnett's self-professed influences are Jean Renoir, Basil Wright, and Federico Fellini, all of whom exemplify the tender, humane and compassionate qualities for which Burnett has been praised, qualities intensely present in Killer of Sheep. Critic Andrew O'Hehir, noting the strong influences of Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, and Satyajit Ray, said, \\"It's hard to overemphasize how strange and ambitious and completely out of context it was for a black urban filmmaker with no money and no reputation to make that kind of movie in 1977.\\"\\"Killer of Sheep\\" by Andrew O'Hehir, Salon.com, March 30, 2007 In 2008, the film was ranked by Empire magazine No. 398 of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.Empire's The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

In 1997, this film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry. Plot Lars Knutson Rockne, a carriage builder, moves his family from Norway in 1892, settling in Chicago. His son, Knute, saves up his money and enrolls in college at the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana, where he plays football. Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais star in Notre Dame's historic 35-13 upset over Army at West Point in 1913. The game was historically significant as Notre Dame employed the seldom-used forward pass to great effect. The publicity from the Fighting Irish's surprise win created Notre Dame football fans around the country. After graduation, Rockne marries sweetheart Bonnie Skiles and stays on at Notre Dame to teach chemistry, work on synthetic rubber in the chemistry lab (under Father Julius Nieuwland) and in his spare time, serve as an assistant coach of the Fighting Irish football team under Coach Jesse Harper. An outstanding freshman halfback, George Gipp, leads the Irish to greater gridiron glory. Gipp is stricken with a fatal illness after the final game of the 1920 season, however, and, on his death bed, encourages Rockne at some future date to tell the team to go out and \\"win one for the Gipper.\\" Notre Dame continues its football success with a backfield of stars dubbed \\"the Four Horsemen.\\" Rockne, tragically, is killed in a 1931 plane crash on a trip to California, but his legend makes him a campus immortal.

The Gipper sequence was subsequently cut for later television showings by United Artists when they had the rights for many years. After its initial release to home video, MGM/UA restored this sequence as part of the original uncut version, and this is the version that has been shown on all home video, television, and theatrical reissues since. The phrase \\"Win one for the Gipper\\" was later used as a political slogan by Ronald Reagan, who was often referred to as \\"The Gipper\\" due to playing the role in the movie. A famous use of it was at the 1988 Republican National Convention when Reagan told his Vice President George H. W. Bush, \\"George, go out there and win one for the Gipper.\\" It was also used at the 1996 Republican National Convention by Bob Dole, as the 1996 Republican National Convention was held in Reagan's home state of California. It was used again in the 2004 Republican National Convention by President George W. Bush in his acceptance speech when he stated \\"we can now truly win one for the Gipper,\\" shortly after Reagan's death. The line is spoken by the dying pilot Al Ross in the 1964 film Flight to Fury. The speech is parodied in the movie Airplane!, which was released when Reagan was running for the presidency in 1980. Historical errors Neither Notre Dame nor the NCAA recognizes Knute Rockne as a (first team) All American. In the 1928 Notre Dame-Army game at Yankee Stadium, where Rockne implores his team at halftime to \\"Win one for the Gipper,\\" the final score is shown as a 7-6 victory for Notre Dame. The actual final score of the game was 12-6.

He was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but Aristarchus identified the \\"central fire\\" with the Sun, and he put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. Like Anaxagoras before him, he suspected that the stars were just other bodies like the Sun, albeit farther away from Earth. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Nicolaus Copernicus attributed the heliocentric theory to Aristarchus.  Heliocentrism  The original text has been lost, but a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner (Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli) describes a work in which he advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis to geocentrism: Aristarchus suspected the stars were other suns that are very far away, and that in consequence there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moves around the Sun. Since stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes, his accurate speculation was unprovable at the time. It is a common misconception that the heliocentric view was held as sacrilegious by the contemporaries of Aristarchus. Lucio Russo traces this to Gilles M√©nage's printing of a passage from Plutarch's On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon, in which Aristarchus jokes with Cleanthes, who is head of the Stoics, a sun worshipper, and opposed to heliocentrism.; In the manuscript of Plutarch's text, Aristarchus says Cleanthes should be charged with impiety. M√©nage's version, published shortly after the trials of Galileo and Giordano Bruno, transposes an accusative and nominative so that it is Aristarchus who is purported to be impious. The resulting misconception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still transmitted today. According to Plutarch, while Aristarchus postulated heliocentrism only as a hypothesis, Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus, maintained it as a definite opinion and gave a demonstration of itPlutarch, Platonicae quaestiones, VIII, i but no full record has been found. In his Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder later wondered whether errors in the predictions about the heavens could be attributed to a displacement of the Earth from its central position. PlinyNaturalis historia, II, 70 and SenecaNaturales quaestiones, VII, xxv, 6‚Äì7 referred to the retrograde motion of some planets as an apparent (and not real) phenomenon, which is an implication of heliocentrism rather than geocentrism. Still, no stellar parallax was observed, and Plato, Aristotle, and Ptolemy preferred the geocentric model, which was held as true throughout the Middle Ages. The heliocentric theory was revived by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler described planetary motions with greater accuracy with his three laws. Isaac Newton later gave a theoretical explanation based on laws of gravitational attraction and dynamics. After realizing that the sun was much larger than the earth and the other planets, Aristarchus concluded that planets revolved around the sun. But this brilliant insight, it turned out, \\"was too much for the philosophers of the time to swallow and astronomy had to wait 2000 years more to find the right path.\\"  Distance to the Sun (lunar dichotomy)  Aristarchus's 3rd-century BC calculations on the relative sizes of (from left) the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy The only known surviving work usually attributed to Aristarchus, On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, is based on a geocentric world view. It has historically been read as stating that the angle subtended by the Sun's diameter is two degrees, but Archimedes states in The Sand Reckoner that Aristarchus had a value of ¬Ω degree, which is much closer to the actual average value of 32' or 0.53 degrees. The discrepancy may come from a misinterpretation of what unit of measure was meant by a certain Greek term in the text of Aristarchus.http://www.dioi.org/vols/we0.pdf Aristarchus claimed that at half moon (first or last quarter moon), the angle between the Sun and Moon was 87¬∞.Greek Mathematical Works, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard University, 1939‚Äì1941, edited by Ivor Thomas, volume 2 (1941), pp. 6‚Äì7 He might have proposed 87¬∞ as a lower bound, since gauging the lunar terminator's deviation from linearity to one degree of accuracy is beyond the unaided human ocular limit (with that limit being about three arcminutes of accuracy). Aristarchus is known to have also studied light and vision.Heath, 1913, pp. 299‚Äì300; Thomas, 1942, pp. 2‚Äì3. Using correct geometry, but the insufficiently accurate 87¬∞ datum, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was between 18 and 20 times farther away than the Moon.A video on reconstruction of Aristarchus' method, in Turkish without subtitles. (The true value of this angle is close to 89¬∞ 50', and the Sun's distance is actually about 400 times that of the Moon.) The implicit false solar parallax of slightly under three degrees was used by astronomers up to and including Tycho Brahe, c. AD 1600\\\\. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth; thus, the diameter of the Sun was calculated to be between 18 and 20 times the diameter of the Moon.

Along with her equally larcenous father, \\"Colonel\\" Harrington, and his partner Gerald, she is out to fleece rich, naive Charles Pike, the heir to the Pike Ale fortune, \\"The Ale That Won for Yale\\". Charles is a woman-shy snake expert Ophiologist, just returning from a year-long expedition up the Amazon. Though surrounded by ladies desperate for his attention, Charles is putty in Jean's hands. But even the best laid plans can go astray. First, Jean falls hard for Charles and shields him from her card sharp father. Then, when Charles' suspicious minder/valet Muggsy discovers the truth about her and her father, he dumps her. Furious at being scorned, she re-enters his life masquerading as the posh \\"Lady Eve Sidwich\\", niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith, another con man who's been swindling the rich folk of Connecticut. Jean is determined to torment Charles mercilessly, as she explains, \\"I've got some unfinished business with him‚ÄîI need him like the axe needs the turkey.\\" When Charles meets \\"Eve\\", he is so bewildered he constantly trips and falls over himself. Although Muggsy tries to convince him \\"she's the same dame\\", Charles reasons that Jean would never come close to his home without at least disguising herself, so he concludes the resemblance is only a coincidence. After a brief courtship, they marry, and on the train to their honeymoon, \\"Eve\\" begins to confess her past, dropping name after name after name of old boyfriends and lovers. Charles finally gets fed up and jumps off the train. Now separated, Jean's con team urges her to close the deal, saying she's got him over a barrel and can make a killing in a settlement.

Sturges was assigned to write a script based on Hoffe's story in 1938, with Claudette Colbert expected to be the star. Sturges and Paramount producer Albert Lewin had some written disagreement in 1939 about the development of the script, with Lewin writing to Sturges, \\"the first two- thirds of the script, in spite of the high quality of your jokes, will require an almost one hundred percent rewrite.\\" Sturges objected, and eventually Lewin gave in, writing, \\"Follow your witty nose, my boy; it will lead you and me and Paramount to the Elysian pastures of popular entertainment.\\"Miller, Frank and Jeff Stafford. \\"Articles: The Lady Eve.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

The casting of the lead roles for The Lady Eve went through some changes. At some point, the studio wanted Brian Aherne for the male lead, and Joel McCrea, Madeleine Carroll and Paulette Goddard were under consideration as of July 1940, but in August 1940, Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll were announced as co-stars. In September, Darryl Zanuck lent Henry Fonda to co-star with Paulette Goddard, who was then replaced by Barbara Stanwyck.

Jean Harrington is clearly in control of the situation for the majority of the film, until her feelings get in the way of her previous, dubious intentions. Until she realizes that she loves him, there is little sense of the struggle between equals that typifies most romantic comedies. The film has been lauded for a unique blend of slapstick and satire.Coursodon 1983, p. 322. We see the \\"fall of man\\" implied by the title of the film in many ways. First is \\"fall\\" in the literal sense, with Pike continuously falling down in various situations, and his \\"fall from innocence\\" as he is sucked into the deceptive plots laid out by Jean.Faith 1995, p. 162. Sturges also uses deceptiveness in appearance profusely throughout the film. Things as small as the distinction, or lack thereof, between beer and ale, as well as the various disguises of Jean Harrington, add depth to the plot line. Even most of the characters have two names (Charles=Hopsie, Jean=Eugenia/Eve Sidwich). This lack of recognition sets the stage for the storyline. Sturges repeatedly suggests that the \\"lowliest boob could rise to the top with the right degree of luck, bluff and fraud.\\"Sarris 1995, p. 113.

Production The night that they arrived in New York after their first tour of England with their vaudeville routines, George Burns and Gracie Allen attended a party where they were approached by their agent Arthur Lyons, who asked if they'd be interested in filming a short for Warner Brothers the following morning. Comedian Fred Allen was slated to film one of his comedy routines but had come down with the flu, leaving the studio in the lurch. Burns was told that the job paid $1,700, so he said yes on the spot. \\"I'd never heard of $1,700 in my life, especially for nine minutes' work,\\" Burns quipped. When they arrived on the set of the Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn the next morning, Burns was shocked to see his childhood buddy Murray Roth, who was directing. Burns didn't believe Roth was in showbiz, let alone a film director, so Roth shouted \\"Lights!\\" and the set lights come on. \\"Off!\\" he shouted, and the stage went black. This glimpse of the living room set that they'd be shooting on perplexed Burns due to his familiarity with theatre and street performance. His toup√©e was still in his luggage, which he hadn't had time to pick up from the loading dock following their trip. To explain why he was wearing a hat, he quickly rewrote the comedy duo's \\"Lambchops\\" routine to begin with himself and Gracie coming into the room and looking for the audience. Reception According to George Burns, Warner Bros. was not impressed with the short, which he himself described as, \\"not the greatest\\", so they were not asked to shoot any more for the studio. Burns, however was so enamored by the paycheck that he actively sought out more film work and was quickly embraced by Paramount Pictures, with whom Burns and Allen subsequently released a whole series of short subjects.

The film was directed by Fred M. Wilcox from a screenplay by Hugo Butler based upon the 1940 novel Lassie Come-Home by Eric Knight. The film was the first in a series of seven MGM films starring \\"Lassie.\\" The original film saw a sequel, Son of Lassie in 1945 with five other films following at intervals through the 1940s. A British remake of the 1943 movie was released in 2005 as Lassie to moderate success. The film has been released to VHS and DVD. Plot Set in Depression-era Yorkshire, England, Mr and Mrs Carraclough are hit by hard times and forced to sell their collie, Lassie, to the rich Duke of Rudling, who has always admired her. Young Joe Carraclough grows despondent at the loss of his companion. Lassie will have nothing to do with the Duke, however, and finds ways to escape her kennels and return to Joe. The Duke finally carries Lassie to his home hundreds of miles distant in Scotland. There, his granddaughter Priscilla senses the dog's unhappiness and arranges her escape. Lassie then sets off for a long trek to her Yorkshire home. She faces many perils along the way, dog catchers and a violent storm, but also meets kind people who offer her aid and comfort. At the end, when Joe has given up hope of ever seeing his dog again, the weary Lassie returns to her favorite resting place in the schoolyard at home. There, Lassie is joyfully reunited with the boy she loves. Main cast Production The film was shot in Washington state and Monterey, California, while the rapids scene was shot on the San Joaquin River. It also features scenes from the former Janss Conejo Ranch in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. Additional photography occurred in Big Bear Lake. During the film's production, MGM executives previewing the dailies were said to be so moved that they ordered more scenes to be added to \\"this wonderful motion picture.\\" Some sources say that, initially, a female collie was selected for the title role, but was replaced when the dog began to shed excessively during shooting of the film in the summer.\\"Lassie a 'Lass-he'\\", Parade magazine, 18 October 1992, p. 22. The trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, then substituted the male collie, Pal, in the role of \\"Lassie\\". Pal had been hired to perform the rapids stunt and, being male, looked more impressive in the part. Still other accounts, such as a 1943 New York Times article written while the film was in production, say that Pal was cast by director Fred Wilcox after first being rejected, because no other dog performed satisfactorily with the \\"near human attributes\\" he sought for the canine title role. Weatherwax would later receive all rights to the Lassie name and trademark in lieu of back pay owed him by MGM.Collins, Ace. Lassie: A Dog's Life. Penguin Books.

Plot The Last of the Mohicans complete film In 1757, in the midst of the French and Indian War, three French divisions and their Huron Indian allies are advancing on Fort William Henry, a British stronghold south of Lake George in the colony of New York. Chingachgook (Theodore Lorch) sends his son Uncas (Roscoe), the last living warrior of the Mohican tribe, to warn the fort's commander, Colonel Munro (James Gordon), of the imminent danger. Uncas is admired by Munro's daughter Cora (Barbara Bedford), much to the displeasure of her suitor, Captain Randolph (George Hackathorne). Upon receiving Munro's plea for assistance, General Webb (Sydney Deane) dispatches a relief force of 3000 men to Fort William Henry with the Munro sisters, but with the aid of an Indian runner named Magua (Beery), the sisters and Major Heyward (Henry Woodward) take a shortcut through the wilderness. Magua, who is a Huron sympathizer, then pretends to lose his way. In the forest they encounter Uncas, Chingachgook and the hunter and scout Hawkeye (Harry Lorraine), accompanied by an eccentric preacher named David Gamut (Nelson McDowell). When Heyward asks for directions to Fort Edward, the men become suspicious of Magua who, like all Indians in the area, should have an intimate knowledge of the terrain. Their fears of treachery are confirmed when they discover that Magua has disappeared. Uncas and Hawkeye conceal Heyward and the women in a cave, but Magua and his men find the hiding place, and after a fierce firefight the women are captured. Magua offers to spare \\"Golden Hair\\" (Alice) if Cora will become his squaw; but Uncas, Chingachgook and Hawkeye counterattack and rescue the hostages. Although they leave Magua for dead, he is actually uninjured. The hostages and their rescuers arrive at Fort William Henry at the same time as the column of troops, but the situation is still dire. The only thing keeping the besiegers at bay is a formidable gun emplacement on the left rampart. The cowardly Captain Randolph informs Montcalm, the French commander, that the rampart guns are nonfunctional, leaving Munro no choice but to surrender the fort. Though promised safe passage for the women and children, the Hurons, under the influence of French-supplied whiskey, slaughter the civilians and torch the fort. Magua kidnaps the Munro sisters for a second time and flees. Uncas and Hawkeye pursue him, but Magua reaches a neutral Delaware village. The dispute is taken before a Delaware council of three; their judgment is that Cora be released to Uncas, and that Alice remain with Magua. To save her sister, Cora offers to take her place. Uncas vows that Magua will not leave with his true love; but by Delaware law, Magua is protected until sundown. That night, Cora escapes and is pursued by Magua to the edge of a precipice. She threatens to jump if he approaches, so Magua waits patiently for her to fall asleep. When she does, he grabs her arm. She flings herself off the cliff, but Magua still has hold of her arms. When Uncas appears, the situation is reversed: Cora tries to save herself, but Magua uses his knife to pry her fingers loose, and she falls to her death. In the ensuing fight, Magua stabs Uncas, whose body rolls down the embankment to rest near Cora's. With his final, dying strength, Uncas reaches forth and takes Cora's hand in his. Magua flees when Chingachgook and Hawkeye arrive, but Hawkeye shoots him dead. At Cora and Uncas's burial ceremony, Munro laments the passing of his daughter and Chingachgook mourns for his son, the last of the Mohicans.

She had become his platonic friend and steady companion, and he used his considerable fame, influence, and connections to advance her career. McPherson also questions Laura's parasitic playboy fianc√©, Shelby Carpenter, a \\"kept man\\" and companion to her wealthy socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell. Treadwell is tolerant of her niece's infatuation with Carpenter, apparently out of her practical acceptance of Carpenter's need for the affection of a woman closer to his own age. All the while, Treadwell is carrying on with Carpenter and giving him money. Detective McPherson finally questions Laura's loyal housekeeper, Bessie Clary. Through the testimony of Laura's friends and reading through her letters and diary, McPherson becomes obsessed with her ‚Äì so much so that Lydecker finally accuses him of falling in love with the dead woman. He also learns that Lydecker was jealous of Laura's suitors, using his newspaper column and influence to keep them at bay. One night, the detective falls asleep in Laura's apartment in front of her portrait. He is awakened by a woman entering the apartment, and is shocked that it is Laura. She finds a dress in her closet that had belonged to one of her models, Diane Redfern. McPherson concludes that the body assumed to have been Laura was in fact Redfern, brought there by Carpenter while Laura was away in the country. Now, unmasking the killer becomes even more urgent. At a party celebrating Laura's return, McPherson arrests Laura for the murder of Diane Redfern. Upon questioning her, he is convinced that she is innocent and that she does not love Shelby. He goes to search Lydecker's apartment, where he becomes suspicious of a clock that is identical to the one in Laura's apartment. On closer examination, he finds it has a secret compartment. McPherson returns to Laura's apartment. Lydecker is there and notices a growing bond between Laura and the detective. Lydecker insults McPherson and is sent away by Laura, but pauses on the stairwell outside. McPherson examines Laura's clock and finds the shotgun that killed Diane. Laura is confronted with the truth: Lydecker is the murderer. McPherson locks Laura into her apartment, warning her to admit no one. After he leaves, Lydecker emerges from another room and attempts to kill Laura, saying that if he cannot have her, no one can. He is shot down by McPherson's sergeant, who had told McPherson that Lydecker had never left the building, causing McPherson and two other policeman to return to the apartment. Lydecker's last words are: \\"Goodbye, Laura. Goodbye, my love.\\" Cast * Gene Tierney as Laura Hunt * Dana Andrews as Mark McPherson * Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker * Vincent Price as Shelby Carpenter * Judith Anderson as Ann Treadwell * Dorothy Adams as Bessie Clary (uncredited) * Larry Steers as Man Dining with Laura (uncredited) * Eric Wilton as Restaurant Patron (uncredited) Production Otto Preminger was looking for a theatrical project to direct and first became aware of Vera Caspary's story when her agent offered him the first draft of a play called Ring Twice for Laura. Preminger liked the high-society setting and the unusual plot twist, but he felt the work needed a major revision and offered to rewrite it with its author. Caspary and he disagreed about the direction they should take it, and she opted to collaborate with writer George Sklar, instead. Marlene Dietrich expressed interest in portraying the title character, but without the attachment of Dietrich or another major star, Caspary was unable to find a producer willing to finance a national tour or a Broadway run, and she abandoned the project. Caspary eventually adapted the play for both a novel with the same title, and a sequel, which she titled simply Laura, both of which eventually were purchased by 20th Century Fox for $30,000. George Sanders and Laird Cregar were announced as the leads. Interim studio head William Goetz, serving in that capacity while Darryl F. Zanuck was fulfilling his military duty, assigned Preminger the task of developing the books for the screen. Preminger began working with Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt. Recalling the differences of opinion Caspary and he had, Preminger opted not to involve her until the first draft was completed. He sensed the more interesting character was not Laura, but Waldo Lydecker, and expanded his role accordingly. Caspary was unhappy with the changes to her plot, though. Zanuck, with whom Preminger previously had clashed, returned to the studio and was angered to discover Goetz had rehired his nemesis. In retaliation, he announced that Preminger could produce Laura, but not direct it, and assigned him to helm In the Meantime, Darling, instead. Several directors, including Lewis Milestone, were offered and rejected Laura until Rouben Mamoulian finally agreed to direct. Mamoulian immediately ignored all of Preminger's directives as producer and began to rewrite the script. To Preminger's dismay, he cast Laird Cregar, known for his portrayal of Jack the Ripper in The Lodger, in the key role of Lydecker. The producer felt casting an actor with a reputation for playing sinister roles would lead the audience to become suspicious of Lydecker earlier than necessary. He favored Clifton Webb, a noted Broadway actor, who had not appeared before the cameras since 1930, and who at that time was performing in the No√´l Coward play Blithe Spirit in Los Angeles. Fox casting director Rufus LeMaire and Zanuck both objected to Webb because of his effeminate mannerisms, which were exactly what Preminger felt suited the character. Preminger filmed the actor delivering a monologue from the Coward play, and Zanuck agreed that Webb was perfect for the role. Zanuck was similarly campaigning for actor Reginald Gardiner to play the role of Shelby, though Fox contractee Vincent Price finally got the role. Filming began on April 27, 1944, and from the start, Mamoulian had problems with his cast. He offered relative newcomers Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews little support, allowed theatrically trained Judith Anderson to play to the balcony instead of reining in her performance, and virtually ignored Webb, who had learned that the director was unhappy with his casting. After viewing the early rushes, Zanuck called a meeting with Mamoulian and Preminger, each of whom blamed the other for the problems on the set. Preminger finally convinced Zanuck that the material needed a more subtle approach than Mamoulian was willing to give it, and the defeated studio head, in frustration, reluctantly allowed Preminger to dismiss Mamoulian and direct the film himself. Preminger immediately hired a new cinematographer and scenic designer and replaced the portrait of Laura ‚Äì a crucial element of the film; Mamoulian's wife Azadia had painted the original portrait, but Preminger replaced that with an enlarged photograph (taken by Fox photographer Frank Polony) of Tierney, lightly dabbed with oils to give it the ethereal effect he wanted.Tierney Autobiography ‚Äì 'Self Portrait', pp. 121‚Äì122 Preminger initially experienced resistance from his cast, who had been led to believe Preminger was unhappy with their work by the departing Mamoulian. \\"Once we got used to Otto, we had a pretty easy time\\", Vincent Price recalled in a July 1989 interview. Filming was completed on June 29, slightly over budget, but within the projected timetable. Zanuck was unhappy with Preminger's first cut of the film and insisted it be given a new ending, in which it was revealed Lydecker had imagined the entire story, but following a screening of the Zanuck version, columnist Walter Winchell approached the studio head and told him, \\"I didn't get [the ending]. You've got to change it.\\" Having lost again, Zanuck relented and allowed Preminger to reinstate his original finale, telling him, \\"This is your success. I concede.\\" =Music= Once the principal photography had been completed, Preminger hired David Raksin to score the film. The director wanted to use \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" by Duke Ellington for the main theme, but Raksin objected to the choice. Alfred Newman, music director for Fox, convinced Preminger to give Raksin a weekend to compose an original tune. Furious, Preminger gave Raksin that weekend, but threatened him with dismissal in case he failed. Inspired by a \\"Dear John\\" letter he received from his wife over the course of that weekend, Raksin composed the haunting theme, also entitled \\"Laura\\", for which Johnny Mercer later wrote lyrics. It eventually became a jazz standard recorded by more than 400 artists, including Stan Kenton, Dick Haymes, Woody Herman, Nat King Cole, The Four Freshmen, Charlie Parker, Billy Eckstine, and Frank Sinatra.[ David Raksin at AllMusic.com] Even Spike Jones did a parody version of the song. Preminger was so pleased with Raksin's score that he not only did not dismiss Raksin, but also collaborated with him on four additional films. =Soundtrack= In 1993, Fox Records released a 27-minute suite of Raksin's score on an album paired with Bernard Herrmann's score for Jane Eyre. In 2013, Kritzerland released the complete Raksin score, along with test demos and the suite from the original album as bonus tracks.

Four of the Five radio adaptations were included as extras on the disc (with the 1950 episode of The Screen Guild Theater omitted). Adaptations =Radio= Laura was adapted as a radio play for two different episodes of Lux Radio Theater, the first starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Vincent Price (February 5, 1945), and the second starring Gene Tierney and Victor Mature (February 1, 1954). It was also adapted for the May 30, 1948, broadcast of Ford Theatre with Virginia Gilmore and John Larkin. In addition, Laura was presented twice on The Screen Guild Theater (August 20, 1945, and February 23, 1950), both episodes starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Clifton Webb. =Television= In 1955, the movie was remade as a presentation of the drama anthology series The 20th Century Fox Hour, starring Dana Wynter in the title role. Robert Stack played McPherson and George Sanders played Lydecker. The director was John Brahm. The script was written by Mel Dinelli. Laura was also adapted for a television production produced by David Susskind, aired on January 24, 1968, starring Lee Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in Gene Tierney's part. Sanders returned in Clifton Webb's role, and Stack in Dana Andrews's. The show was taped in London and the teleplay was written by Truman Capote. It met with unanimous negative reactions, which was attributed to Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's poor acting. An episode of Magnum, P.I. titled \\"Skin Deep\\", written by joint series creator Donald P. Bellisario, used a similar premise. Ian McShane guested as the Lydecker type, an insanely jealous film producer, and Cathie Shirriff guest-starred as the episode's version of Laura Hunt, the prominent actress Erin Wolfe, whose apparent suicide series main character Thomas Sullivan \\"Tom\\" Magnum IV (series lead Tom Selleck) is investigating. As McPherson does in Laura, Magnum learns that, in reality, his investigation subject is not dead. =Film= In 2005, a Bollywood remake entitled Rog was released, directed by Himanshu Brahmbhatt and starring Irrfan Khan and Ilene Hamann.

It depicts the life of Newt Winger, a teenager growing up in Cherokee Flats, Kansas in the 1920s, and chronicles his journey into manhood marked with tragic events. Based on Parks' 1963 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, The Learning Tree was the first film directed by an African-American person for a major American film studio, in this case Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. In 1989, The Learning Tree was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Summary Newt Winger, Marcus Savage, and several of their friends steal apples from Jake Kiner's orchard, and when Kiner confronts the boys, he is beaten and left for dead by Marcus, who is later sent to jail for his actions. While Marcus is in jail, Newt begins to work for Kiner to make up for his actions and those of his friends, and also begins a relationship with the new girl in town Arcella Jefferson, but his relationship with her is ultimately destroyed when Chauncey Cavanaugh, a white man and son of the local judge, rapes and impregnates Arcella, who ultimately moves away out of shame. Another scene also shows Newt forced into a brutal boxing match at the County fair. One day when Newt is eating his lunch in the loft of Kiner's barn, he witnesses the brutal attack and murder of Kiner by Booker Savage, Marcus' father. Newt initially keeps quiet about what he has seen, but appears to be bothered that Silas Newhall, who was at the scene of the crime for another reason, is being accused for a murder he did not commit. Encouraged by his mother Sarah, Newt reveals to Judge Cavanaugh that Booker committed the murder, and also testifies in court, but rather than doing the good he intended it to do, Newt's testimony leads to the suicide of Booker and almost being killed by Marcus. Through all this, the film is able to capture \\"an adolescent boy's initiation in sex, love, death, justice and injustice, and, because he is black, a fair measure of racial hatred\\" in \\"a profoundly nostalgic way\\", according to New York Times movie reviewer Roger Greenspun. Cast * Kyle Johnson as Newt Winger * Alex Clarke as Marcus Savage * Estelle Evans as Sarah Winger * Mira Waters as Arcella Jefferson * George Mitchell as Jake Kiner * Richard Ward as Booker Savage * Malcolm Attenbury as Silas Newhall * Russell Thorson as Judge Cavanaugh * Zooey Hall as Chauncey Cavanaugh * Dana Elcar as Sheriff Kirky * Felix Nelson as Jack Winger * Joel Fluellen as Uncle Rob Background The film The Learning Tree is based on Gordon Parks' 1963 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. Parks also wrote the screenplay, and as a result, the script for the movie did not deviate much from the book, except for featuring fewer characters for the sake of time. In addition to being the screenwriter, he was also the director, producer, and music composer. Assisting him with directing were Jack Aldworth and Fred Giles. Also working with Parks was James Lydon as associate producer and Burnett Guffey as cinematographer. These men tried to include as many black technicians as possible for the film. Parks personally chose Kyle Johnson to play the character of Newt, after a brief meeting with him in a Beverly Hills hotel. However, during the meeting, he gave no inclination that he wanted to cast Johnson, but Johnson kept getting called in from screen tests. After the fourth screen test, he found out that he had already been hired and the screen tests were meant to gauge the abilities of the other actors, not him. Not surprisingly, Johnson characterized the audition process as \\"not normal\\". According to Turner Classic Movies, the original name of the film was Learn, Baby, Learn before it was changed to its current name. The current title appears to be taken from a line in the film, one that Sarah Winger tells her son Newt: \\"Let Cherokee Flats be your learning tree.\\" In context, the title of the film appears to signify that no matter where Newt lives in life, the lessons he learned in Cherokee Flats would guide his actions.  Film production  The Learning Tree was shot on location in Fort Scott, Kansas in the fall of 1968, and the production process was scheduled to take three months. Fort Scott had been where Parks grew up, and it was also the basis for the fictional town of Cherokee Flats. Kyle Johnson remembers that when production began there was a circus in town. As a result, the circus scene in the film features an actual circus rather than a staged one. Moreover, the circus scene included citizens of Fort Scott, who were there for the circus in town anyway. Additionally, Johnson recalls that his ‚Äúmost enjoyable work as an actor‚Äù was done under Gordon Parks. Specifically, Johnson says, ‚ÄúI really enjoyed The Learning Tree; for me it was like being part of a tight-run ship, a well-oiled machine. You do your part and you recognize its importance and relationship to all the other parts, cast, crew, director and so forth.‚Äù Parks is remembered for following his instincts while filming, and for also encouraging the actors to follow their own instincts while acting. This ease while filming probably contributed to the fact that scenes were shot in very few takes. During the film production, ‚Äúsuits‚Äù from Warner Bros. often visited the set. Since Parks was an African-American director, Warner sent representatives over to check up on Parks and to make sure that production was running smoothly.  Exodusters  In 1879, many African Africans migrated to Kansas and they became known as the \\"Exodusters\\". Among those who traveled were the ancestors of Gordon Parks. His father, Andrew Jackson Parks, was a tenant farmer in Kansas. Given that Gordon Parks was born in Fort Scott, Kansas in 1912, he was the \\"issue of the second generation of exodusters\\". His ancestral background played a role in choosing Fort Scott as the filming location for The Learning Tree. The Exodusters earned their name after nearly 6,000 African Americans migrated to Kansas after the Emancipation. Their exodus was prompted by the 1879 Windom Resolution that encouraged African Americans to leave the southern states where they were still met with much hatred, even though the American Civil War had ended a little more than a decade earlier. Kansas promised a fresh start for the Exodusters, who wanted to begin a new life, in a new land, away from the southerners who had once enslaved them.  Depictions of black manhood  The Learning Tree juxtaposes the lives of Newt Winger and Marcus Savage, two former friends that are trying to find themselves in a white-dominated Midwestern society. Though these two young men have different personalities and different goals in life, both characters represent two examples of black manhood. Newt is a young man who tries to adhere to morals, although upset by the racial injustice of the day. When adversity occurs, he always acts with dignity. When he and his friends steal from Jake Kiner, he attempts to make amends by working for him pro bono. When Chauncey Cavanaugh takes a liking to Newt's girlfriend Arcella, he does his best to protect her and ultimately he comes to term with his loss without showing aggression. He tells the truth in the Kiner murder trial, even though it exposes Booker Savage as the killer and African Americans are subsequently shown in an unfavorable light. Newt's determination to act morally shows that he is trying to feel empowered by doing the right thing. His desire to pursue a college education is, according to scholar Aza Nedhari, a healthy way in which black males may feel empowered. On the contrary, Marcus is a young man who is also upset by the racial injustice of the day, but retaliates with violence. His rocky relationship with his father, Booker, does not help his psyche and predisposes him to violence. Nedhari suggests that \\"boys who are victims of patriarchy often become the world views of patriarchy, unconsciously embodying the abusiveness that they recognized as evil.\\" In the case of Marcus, he begins to embody violence, specifically when he beats Kiner and attempts to murder Newt for sending both him and his father to jail. According to Nedhari, violence is one way that underprivileged black males find themselves.  Soundtrack  Gordon Parks composed and wrote the following selections of score music in The Learning Tree: # The Learning Tree ‚Äì Main Title, sung by Avery Brooks # The Storm To Calm # Bluebird # The Swimming Hole # Concerto (Arcella's Theme) # Birthday Present # Chorale (The Learning Tree) # Poor Tuck # Questions & Answers # My Baby's Gone (feat. Jimmy Rushing) # The Fight # Confrontation (feat. Kyle Johnson & Joel Fluellen) # Hymn ‚Äì End Title New York Times reviewer Roger Greenspun praised the film's score in his review, saying that the music \\"telegraphs and then drains each crisis\\".  Reception  When The Learning Tree premiered at the Trans-Lux Theater in New York City on August 6, 1969, it was well-received by critics. Greenspun commented in his review that the scenes in the film took on a \\"kind of ceremonial vitality and lifelikeness\\". Parks and Guffey's strong attention to detail helped to make this film beloved and well-remembered to the American public. The Learning Tree was one of the first 25 films to be listed on National Film Registry when the registry was created in 1989.

Content  The film consists of six shots. The most recognizable of these depicts four animated food items (from left to right: candy bar or box of chewing gum, popcorn, candy, and a soft drink) singing and walking leftwards. In the foreground before these characters are silhouettes of audience members, creating an illusion of depth, a standard technique of the medium. In a later shot, a group of four consumers are depicted enjoying their purchased food items. The eponymous song of the film is set to the same tune as \\"We Won't Be Home Until Morning\\", \\"The Bear Went Over the Mountain\\", \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\", and \\"Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre\\" (). The tune is of unknown origin and probably predates these songs. It was well enough known in the early 19th century to be used for a passage in Wellington's Victory (1813) by Ludwig van Beethoven. Daniel Eagan argues that \\"[w]ith its simple, repetitive lyrics and streamlined animation, Let's All Go to the Lobby has a hypnotic pull that is as compelling today as it was fifty years ago.\\" He also notes that by choosing not to simply photograph the offered items, the creators of the film avoided using brand names for the products for sale. Background and history The Chicago-based Filmack Studios, originally known as Filmack Trailer Company, was founded in 1919 by Irving Mack. The company specialized in the production of newsreels and promotional material for theaters. The film is technically known as a snipe, which is defined as material displayed on a projection screen without being part of the featured presentation. This includes advertising material, previews of coming attractions, courtesy requests for the audience, and notices concerning the concession stand of the movie theater. By the 1950s, the sales of the concession stands represented a significant portion of movie theaters' revenue. Filmack commissioned a series of Technicolor trailers aimed at informing audiences about a theater's newly installed concession stand. Let's All Go to the Lobby was one of these films. The trailer was animated by Dave Fleischer and produced by Filmack Studios. Fleischer was identified as the creator of this short film in a list of Filmack's releases which reported that \\"Both trailers were produced exclusively for Filmack by Dave Fleischer...\\". Specific details for his involvement are lacking, and the rest of the production crew remains unknown. Production may have started by 1953,Inspiration - Filmack Catalog. February, 1954. Volume 15, Issue 2. Page 10. but Robbie Mack (a later owner of Filmack) estimates it was completed . The release date is typically estimated to 1957. The original production records are considered lost. Filmack sold to various theater owners the right to use the film, which it still owns. The lyrics were written by Jack Tillar. Legacy Filmack has continued selling copies in the decades since its production. The company estimates that 80% of independent theaters have screened the film at various points, and it is likely the most viewed snipe. In 2000, Let's All Go to the Lobby was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". = In popular culture = In 2013, the film was re-used in a pre-movie GEICO commercial in which the characters leave the set after that performance and talk on their cell phones to talk about their schedules and their performances. The Gecko appears and talks to them about not using their cell phones while the movie is playing. The food items apologize to the viewers and go back in the scene in the opposite direction where they sing \\"Let's All Silence Our Cell Phones\\". In 2019, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part made a parody reference to this short film. The clip of the singing concessions has frequently been parodied in advertisements of the 2000s. These include a 2006 spot for Chipotle Mexican Grill where a burrito attempts to join the characters, a 2011 spot for the Tribeca Film Festival where the characters are mobsters voiced by the cast of The Sopranos, and a 2013 GEICO commercial where the characters are chided for speaking on their cell phones. It has also been spoofed in popular entertainment including Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, and appears in fictional depictions of theaters. Lionsgate produced a quarantine-themed version of the snipe to accompany special presentations of films streamed online during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Published in 1922, it tells the story of an author who, while reading a letter written by a woman he does not remember, gets glimpses into her life story. Plot A rich and well-known writer (R.), returning home to Vienna from one of many holidays, finds a long letter from an unknown woman (Fr√§ulein). As a teenager the woman had lived with her poor widowed mother in the same building and had fallen totally in love with both the opulent cultured lifestyle of her neighbour and the handsome charming man himself. Her passion for the writer was not lessened by the flow of attractive women spending the night with him nor when she had to leave Vienna and moved to Innsbruck when her mother remarried. At age 18 she returned to Vienna, took a job and tried to meet the writer again. He did not recognise her and, without revealing her name, she succeeded in spending three nights with him before he disappeared on a long holiday. Pregnant, she lost her job and had to give birth in a refuge for the indigent. Resolved that their child should have a good life, she spent nights with or became mistress of various rich men but would never marry because her heart belonged always to the writer. Out one night with a current lover, she saw the writer in a night club and went home with him instead. To him, she was just an agreeable companion for that night, as he again did not recognise her.

Connie Field got the idea for the film from a California Rosie the Riveter reunion, and, with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other charitable sources, conducted interviews with many hundreds of women who had gone into war work. Out of these she chose five representatives‚Äîthree black, two white‚Äîall marvelously lively, intelligent, and articulate women who recall their experiences with a mixture of pleasant nostalgia and detached bitterness. The reminiscences are intercut with the realities of the period ‚Äì old news, films, recruiting trailers, March of Time clips, and pop songs such as \\"Rosie the Riveter.\\" These often serve to highlight the disparities between how women were portrayed in wartime media and the actual experiences of these five women. Reception The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter premiered at the New York Film Festival in 1980, which at that time was one of the most important film festivals in America, and went on to be screened at over 50 film festivals around the world. The film was released in movie theaters in the United States, England and Australia to rave reviews. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"warm, engaging and poignant\\" and went on to say \\"the film has that Studs Terkel-like ability to discover the extraordinary in seemingly ordinary people. Terrific.\\" Of the Rosies themselves The London Times said \\"the resilience, spirit and humour of Connie Field's indomitable heroines sends you out elated and loving them.\\" The film earned fifteen international awards for Best Documentary, was named \\"One of the Ten Best Films of the Year\\" by a number of publications, including the Village Voice and Film Comment, and was voted \\"Best Independent Feature of the Year\\" in American Film Magazine.

The film stars Richie Andrusco in the title role of Joey Norton and Richard Brewster as his brother Lennie. Little Fugitive influenced the French New Wave and is considered by modern-day critics to be a landmark film because of its naturalistic style and groundbreaking use of nonprofessional actors in lead roles. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story and screened at Venice film festival where it was awarded the silver lion. In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". It was the first and best known of Engel's three feature films. It was followed by Lovers and Lollipops in 1956 and Weddings and Babies, filmed in 1957 and released in 1960. All three films were similar stylistically and were filmed with hand-held 35 mm. cameras. The cameras used in the first two movies did not record sound, and dialogue was dubbed subsequent to filming. Weddings and Babies was the first fiction feature filmed with a portable camera that allowed synchronized sound. Plot Joey Norton, seven years old, lives with his older brother Lennie in a lower- middle-class neighborhood of Brooklyn. Joey is too small to be taken seriously by Lennie and Lennie's friends. Richie Andrusco in Little Fugitive One day, while their mother is away visiting her sick mother, Lennie and his friends play a joke on Joey. They stage an incident using catsup and a toy gun, so that Joey thinks he has shot and killed his brother. Joey, who is told the police will catch and imprison him, runs to the nearest elevated train station and flees to Coney Island. He seems to forget his predicament and spends the day wandering around the arcades, pony rides, beach‚Äîa little boy's paradise. He gets money for snacks by cashing in deposit bottles and spends the night sleeping under the boardwalk. Meanwhile, Lennie is frantically trying to find him as their mother is due home soon. Joey loves horses, and he begins hanging around a pony ride. The proprietor of the ride becomes suspicious that Joey is a runaway. He tricks Joey into giving him his address. He calls home and alerts Lennie. Lennie comes to Coney Island, and after a frantic search, finds little Joey. Their mother returns just after the two brothers arrive home. She is unaware of what happened, and pleased that her two sons behaved so well during her absence, says they will have a treat that weekend: a trip to Coney Island! Cast *Richie Andrusco as Joey Norton *Richard Brewster as Lennie Norton *Winifred Cushing as Mother *Jay Williams as Jay the Pony Ride Man *Will Lee as Photographer *Charlie Moss as Harry *Tommy DeCanio as Charley =Cast notes= The lead character of Joey was played by Richie Andrusco, a nonprofessional actor who never appeared in any other film. The other actors in the film were also largely nonprofessionals. Actor Will Lee (who later played Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street) made a cameo appearance as a Coney Island photographer. Writer/director Raymond Abrashkin and actor Jay Williams later co-wrote the \\"Danny Dunn\\" series of juvenile science fiction novels. Production notes The film was filmed on location at Coney Island and Brooklyn, United States, using a unique, concealed strap-on camera, which made it possible for Engel to work without a tripod and large crew. It allowed him to have thousands of beach-going New Yorkers as extras without their knowing it.Brooklyn College Web Site. Last accessed: November 18, 2009 The device could be seen as a prototype for the Steadicam and was designed by him and the inventor Charlie Woodruff, a friend and fellow combat photographer he met during World War II, whom Engel called a \\"\\"mechanical and engineering genius.\\" This innovation proved to be \\"the heart and soul of why Little Fugitive was possible.\\" Over the years, filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick and Jean-Luc Godard were eager to borrow this unique camera. Reception =Critical response= The film was greeted by critical acclaim at the time, and was a major influence on the French New Wave. Fran√ßois Truffaut was inspired by Little Fugitives spontaneous production style when he created The 400 Blows (1959), saying long afterwards: \\"Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way to independent production with [this] fine movie.\\" Modern critics have also praised the film. Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote \\"A remarkable indy classic, made on a shoestring budget by a group of still photographers. It's an affecting lyrical comedy-drama that fully captures the flavor of urban childhood innocence of the 1950s. It's written and directed by the team of Morris Engel and Ray Ashley and Ruth Orkin... The dialogue was sparse, the story was unambitious, the film lacked drama, the children were very ordinary and their problem was only a minor one, nevertheless this beautifully realized film caught the world through the innocent eyes of a curious and scared child and left an impression that was hard to shake. It was uplifting to watch because the effort was so genuine.\\" When the film was screened in New York in 2005, film critic Joshua Land wrote \\"Little Fugitive shines as a beautifully shot document of a bygone Brooklyn‚Äîany drama here resides in the grainy black- and-white cinematography, with its careful attention to the changes in light brought on by the inexorably advancing sun... Filled with 'Aw, fellas!' period ambience and the mythic imagery of cowboys and horses, comics and baseball, it's a key proto-v√©rit√© slice of urban America.\\" Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 15 reviews.Little Fugitive at Rotten Tomatoes.

It was written by William R. Lipman, Sam Hellman, and Gladys Lehman after a 1932 short story of the same name by Damon Runyon. It stars Shirley Temple, Adolphe Menjou and Dorothy Dell in a story about a young girl held as collateral by gangsters. It was Temple's first starring role in a major motion picture and was crucial to establishing her as a major film star. It was named to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1998 and has been remade several times. Plot The film tells the story of \\"Marky\\" (Shirley Temple), whose father gives her to a gangster-run gambling operation as a \\"marker\\" (collateral) for a bet. When he loses his bet and commits suicide, the gangsters are left with her on their hands. They decide to keep her temporarily and use her to help pull off one of their fixed races, naming her the owner of the horse to be used in the race. Marky is sent to live with bookie Sorrowful Jones (Adolphe Menjou). Initially upset about being forced to look after her, he eventually begins to develop a father‚Äìdaughter relationship with her. His fellow gangsters become fond of her and begin to fill the roles of her extended family. Bangles (Dorothy Dell) ‚Äì girlfriend of gang kingpin Big Steve (Charles Bickford), who has gone to Chicago to place bets on the horse ‚Äì also begins to care for Marky, and to fall in love with Sorrowful, whose own concern for Marky shows he has a warm heart beneath his hard-man persona. Encouraged by Bangles and Marky, Sorrowful gets a bigger apartment, buys Marky new clothes and himself a better cut of suit, reads her bedtime stories, and shows her how to pray. However, being around the gang has a somewhat bad influence on Marky, and she begins to develop a cynical nature and a wide vocabulary of gambling terminology and slang. Worried that her acquired bad-girl attitude means she will not get adopted by a \\"good family\\", Bangles and Sorrowful put on a party with gangsters dressed up as knights-of- the-round-table, to rekindle her former sweetness. She is unimpressed until they bring in the horse and parade her around on its back. Returning to New York, Big Steve frightens the horse, which throws her, and she is taken to the hospital. Big Steve goes there to pay back Sorrowful for trying to steal Bangles but is roped into giving Marky the direct blood transfusion she needs for her life-saving operation. Praying for her survival, Sorrowful destroys the drug which, administered to the horse, would have helped it win the race but killed it soon after. Informed that he has \\"good blood\\" and pleased to have given life for a change, Big Steve forgives Bangles and Sorrowful. They plan to marry and adopt Marky.

Her mother, recognizing the potential of the role, arranged for a secret meeting and second audition with the director Alexander Hall. This second audition was successful and Shirley Temple was loaned out to Paramount for $1,000 a week. Temple and Dell struck up a close friendship while filming the movie. The scene in which Temple is refusing her food and using rude language (\\"I don't want no mush\\" and \\"I used to be a sissy\\") had to be redone as Dell could not contain her laughter in the first take. This would be Dell's last completed film of her short career. Temple took Dell's death very hard.Shirley Temple Black, Child Star: An Autobiography (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 42-43. Reception The film was very popular at the box office. As a result of the film's success, Paramount offered Fox $50,000 for Temple's contract, which was declined. Recognition In 1998, Little Miss Marker was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

The film was written by James Algar, Winston Hibler, Jack Moffitt (uncredited) and Ted Sears. It was directed by Algar, with Hibler as the narrator and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. The film won the 1953 Oscar for Best Documentary. It is featured in the 2006 DVD Walt Disney Legacy Collection Volume 2: Lands of Exploration. Production The Living Desert was the first feature-length film in Disney's True-Life Adventures series of documentaries focusing on zoological studies; the previous films in the series, including the Oscar- winning Seal Island, were short subjects. The documentary was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. Most of the wildlife shown in the film was donated to what would soon become the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The film was inspired by 10 minutes of footage shot by N. Paul Kenworthy, a doctoral student at the University of California at Los Angeles. Kenworthy's footage of a battle between a tarantula and a wasp intrigued Disney, who funded a feature-length production following the lives of diverse desert species. Disney was highly supportive of Kenworthy's work and its impact on nonfiction filmmaking, stating, ‚ÄúThis is where we can tell a real, sustained story for the first time in these nature pictures.‚Äù Release Prior to the production of The Living Desert, Disney was releasing his films through RKO Radio Pictures. But due to a long-frayed relation with the studio, which had little enthusiasm for the producer's documentary releases, Disney opted to sever his relation with RKO and create his own distribution subsidiary ‚Äì Buena Vista Distribution, which he named after the street where his office was located. The Living Desert received some criticism for bringing unsubtle humor to its scenes of desert life ‚Äì Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called Disney to task for adding jokey musical effects to several of the film's scenes, including hoedown music for a sequence involving a scorpion mating dance. Nonetheless, the film was a commercial success: the US$300,000 production grossed US$4,000,000 at the box office. The film was very popular in Japan surpassing Gone With the Wind as the highest-grossing film of all time with a gross of over $800,000. Honors The Academy Award that Disney earned for The Living Desert helped the producer make history as the individual with the most Oscar wins in a single year. At the 26th Academy Awards, in addition to winning the Best Documentary Feature Oscar, Disney also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) for The Alaskan Eskimo and the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) for Bear Country. In addition to its Oscar, the film also won the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival, an award at the Berlin Film Festival and a special achievement award from the Golden Globe Awards. In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

Flaherty. Although the events and characters depicted are fictional and the film was commissioned by the Standard Oil Company to promote its drilling ventures in the Louisiana bayous, it is often misidentified as a documentary film when in fact it is a docufiction. Its script was written by Frances H. Flaherty and Robert J. Flaherty. Plot The film deals with the adventures of a young Cajun boy and his pet raccoon, who live a somewhat idyllic existence playing in the bayous of Louisiana. A sub-plot involves his elderly father's allowing an oil company to drill for oil in the inlet that runs behind their house. A completely assembled miniature oil rig on a slender barge is towed into the inlet from connecting narrow waterways. Although there is a moment of crisis when the rig strikes a gas pocket, most of this is dealt with swiftly and off-camera, and the barge, rig, and friendly drillers depart expeditiously, leaving behind a phenomenally clean environment and a wealthy Cajun family. Conflict and action for the plot is provided by the presence of a giant alligator in the area, which is believed to have eaten the pet raccoon and which is hunted in revenge. There is no individual or organized resistance to the incursion of the oil seekers, even after the (brief, offscreen) disaster, who are unequivocally portrayed as friendly, progressive humanitarians. The boy, named in the film as Alexander Napoleon Ulysses Le Tour, but in the credits just identified as \\"the boy\\", was played by Joseph Boudreaux. The film was photographed by Richard Leacock and edited by Helen van Dongen, who were also the associate producers. Its original release was through independent film distributor Lopert Films. Production The film was shot on location in the Louisiana bayou country, using local residents for actors. However, none of the members of the Cajun family (boy, father and mother) were related, and the film does not deal with Cajun culture, the reality of the hard lives of the Cajun people, or with the mechanics of drilling for oil. The story is completely fictional. In 1952, it was reissued by an exploitation film outfit with a new title, Cajun, on the bottom half of a double-bill with another film titled Watusi. Reception and awards The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story in 1948. In 1949, Virgil Thomson won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his score to the film (which is based on a famous field tape of indigenous Cajun musicians and was performed by the Philadelphia Symphony). Through 2016, this has remained the only Pulitzer Prize awarded for a film score.Wikipedia list of Pulitzer Prizes for Music In 1994, Louisiana Story was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".

The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. 'History of the Masque Genre' Development The masque tradition developed from the elaborate pageants and courtly shows of ducal Burgundy in the late Middle Ages. Masques were typically a complimentary offering to the prince among his guests and might combine pastoral settings, mythological fable, and the dramatic elements of ethical debate. There would invariably be some political and social application of the allegory. Such pageants often celebrated a birth, marriage, change of ruler or a Royal Entry and invariably ended with a tableau of bliss and concord. Masque imagery tended to be drawn from Classical rather than Christian sources, and the artifice was part of the Grand dance. Masque thus lent itself to Mannerist treatment in the hands of master designers like Giulio Romano or Inigo Jones. The New Historians, in works like the essays of Bevington and Holbrook's The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque (1998),David Bevington and Peter Holbrook, editors, The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque 1998 ). have pointed out the political subtext of masques. At times, the political subtext was not far to seek: The Triumph of Peace, put on with a large amount of parliament-raised money by Charles I, caused great offence to the Puritans. Catherine de' Medici's court festivals, often even more overtly political, were among the most spectacular entertainments of her day, although the \\"intermezzi\\" of the Medici court in Florence could rival them. =Dumbshow= In English theatre tradition, a dumbshow is a masque-like interlude of silent mime usually with allegorical content that refers to the occasion of a play or its theme, the most famous being the dumbshow played out in Hamlet (III.ii). Dumbshows might be a moving spectacle, like a procession, as in Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (1580s), or they might form a pictorial tableau, as one in the Shakespeare collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre (III.i)‚Äîa tableau that is immediately explicated at some length by the poet-narrator, Gower. Dumbshows were a Medieval element that continued to be popular in early Elizabethan drama, but by the time Pericles (c. 1607‚Äì08) or Hamlet (c. 1600‚Äì02) were staged, they were perhaps quaintly old-fashioned: ‚ÄúWhat means this, my lord?‚Äù is Ophelia's reaction. In English masques, purely musical interludes might be accompanied by a dumbshow. Origins The masque has its origins in a folk tradition where masked players would unexpectedly call on a nobleman in his hall, dancing and bringing gifts on certain nights of the year, or celebrating dynastic occasions. The rustic presentation of \\"Pyramus and Thisbe\\" as a wedding entertainment in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream offers a familiar example. Spectators were invited to join in the dancing. At the end, the players would take off their masks to reveal their identities. =England= In England, Tudor court masques developed from earlier guisings, where a masked allegorical figure would appear and address the assembled company‚Äîproviding a theme for the occasion‚Äîwith musical accompaniment; masques at Elizabeth's court emphasized the concord and unity between Queen and Kingdom. A descriptive narrative of a processional masque is the masque of the Seven Deadly Sins in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene (Book i, Canto IV). A particularly elaborate masque, performed over the course of two weeks for Queen Elizabeth, is described in the 1821 novel Kenilworth, by Sir Walter Scott. Queen Elizabeth was entertained at country houses during her progresses with performances like the Harefield Entertainment.Gabriel Heaton, 'Elizabethan Entertainments in Manuscript: The Harefield Festivities and the Dynamics of Exchange', in Jayne Elisabeth Archer, Elizabeth Goldring, Sarah Knight, Progresses, Pageants, and Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth (Oxford, 2007), pp. 227-244. In Scotland, masques were performed at court, particularly at wedding celebrations, and the royal wardrobe provided costumes.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) pp. 146, 148-9 After the Union of the Crowns, at the court of James I and Anne of Denmark, narrative elements of the masque became more significant. Plots were often on classical or allegorical themes, glorifying the royal or noble sponsor. At the end, the audience would join with the actors in a final dance. Ben Jonson wrote a number of masques with stage design by Inigo Jones. Their works are usually thought of as the most significant in the form. Samuel Daniel and Sir Philip Sidney also wrote masques. William Shakespeare included a masque-like interlude in The Tempest, understood by modern scholars to have been heavily influenced by the masques of Ben Jonson and the stagecraft of Inigo Jones. There is also a masque sequence in his Romeo and Juliet and Henry VIII. John Milton's Comus (with music by Henry Lawes) is described as a masque, though it is generally reckoned a pastoral play. Reconstructions of Stuart masques have been few and far between. Part of the problem is that only texts survive complete; there is no complete music, only fragments, so no authoritative performance can be made without interpretive invention. There is a detailed, humorous and malicious account by Sir John Harington of a 1606 masque of Solomon and Sheba at Theobalds. Harington was not so much concerned with the masque itself as with the notoriously heavy drinking at the Court of King James I; \\"the entertainment went forward, and most of the presenters went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers\\". As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque, the Queen of Sheba was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace. Unfortunately, as Harington reported, the actress playing the Queen tripped over the steps of the throne, sending her gifts flying; Hope and Faith were too drunk to speak a word, while Peace, annoyed at finding her way to the throne blocked, made good use of her symbolic olive branches to slap anyone who was in her way.Henry Harington, Nugae Antiquae, vol. 1 (London, 1804), pp. 348-351 By the time of the English Restoration (1660), the masque was pass√©, but the English semi-opera which developed in the latter part of the 17th century, a form in which John Dryden and Henry Purcell collaborated, borrows some elements from the masque and further elements from the contemporary courtly French opera of Jean-Baptiste Lully. In the 18th-century, masques were even less frequently staged. \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" started out as part of Alfred, a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by James Thomson and David Mallet with music by Thomas Arne which was first performed at Cliveden, country house of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Performed to celebrate the third birthday of Frederick's daughter Augusta, it remains among the best-known British patriotic songs up to the present, while the masque of which it was originally part is only remembered by specialist historians. Legacy The most outstanding humanists, poets and artists of the day, in the full intensity of their creative powers, devoted themselves to producing masques; and until the Puritans closed the English theatres in 1642, the masque was the highest artform in England. But because of its ephemeral nature, not a lot of documentation related to masques remains, and much of what is said about the production and enjoyment of masques is still part speculation. 17th- and 18th-century masques While the masque was no longer as popular as it was at its height in the 17th Century, there are many later examples of the masque. During the late 17th century, English semi-operas by composers such as Henry Purcell had masque scenes inset between the acts of the play proper. In the 18th century, William Boyce and Thomas Arne, among other composers, continued to utilize the masque genre mostly as an occasional piece, and the genre became increasingly associated with patriotic topics. There are isolated examples throughout the first half of the 19th century. Later masques With the renaissance of English musical composition during the late 19th and early 20th century (the so-called English Musical Renaissance), English composers turned to the masque as a way of connecting to a genuinely English musical-dramatic form in their attempts to build a historically-informed national musical style for England. Examples include those by Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren, and even Edward Elgar, whose imperialistic Crown of India was the central feature at the London Coliseum in 2005. Masques also became common as scenes in operettas and musical theatre works set during the Elizabethan period. In the 20th century, Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote several masques, including his masterpiece in the genre, Job, a masque for dancing which premiered in 1930, although the work is closer to a ballet than a masque as it was originally understood. His designating it a masque was to indicate that the modern choreography typical when he wrote the piece would not be suitable. Constant Lambert also wrote a piece he called a masque, Summer's Last Will and Testament, for orchestra, chorus and baritone. His title he took from Thomas Nash, whose masqueIt was a \\"comedy\\" when it was printed, in 1600 as A Pleasant Comedie, call'd Summers Last will and Testament, but, as a character announces, \\"nay, 'tis no Play neither, but a show.\\" With Nash's stage direction \\"Enter Summer, leaning on Autumn's and Winter's shoulders, and attended on with a train of Satyrs and wood-Nymphs, singing: Vertumnus also following him\\" we are recognizably in the world of Masque. was probably first presented before the Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps at his London seat, Lambeth Palace, in 1592.

German 16th Century, a masquerade from Freydal, the tournament book of Maximilian I, c. 1515, pen and brown ink with watercolor on laid paper. One in a series at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, Rosenwald Collection. A masquerade ball (or bal masqu√©) is an event in which many participants attend in costume wearing a mask. (Compare the word \\"masque\\"‚Äîa formal written and sung court pageant.) Less formal \\"costume parties\\" may be a descendant of this tradition. A masquerade ball usually encompasses music and dancing. These nighttime events are used for entertainment and celebrations.  History  Masquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. The \\"Bal des Ardents\\" (\\"Burning Men's Ball\\") was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a Bal des sauvages (\\"Wild Men's Ball\\"), a form of costumed ball (morisco). It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France's queen in Paris on January 28, 1393. The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods (woodwoses), with costumes of flax and pitch. If they came too close to a torch, the dancers would catch fire. (This episode may have influenced Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"Hop-Frog\\".) Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the Ducal Court of Burgundy. Masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian, maschera). They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice. They have been associated with the tradition of the Venetian Carnival. With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether. Masquerade ball at Ch√¢teau de Hattonch√¢tel, France. They became popular throughout mainland Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes with fatal results. In 1792 Gustav III of Sweden was assassinated at a masquerade ball by the disgruntled nobleman Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m, an event which Eug√®ne Scribe and Daniel Auber turned into the opera Gustave III. The same event was the basis of Giuseppe Verdi's opera A Masked Ball, although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in Boston. Most masks came from countries like Switzerland and Italy. A Swiss count who arrived in Italy in 1708, is credited with introducing to London the Venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball, to which one might subscribe, with the first being held at Haymarket Opera House.Aileen Ribeiro, \\"The exotic diversion: the dress worn at masquerades in eighteenth-century London\\", The Connoisseur 197 (January 1978:3-13. London's public gardens, like Vauxhall Gardens, refurbished in 1732, and Ranelagh Gardens, provided optimal outdoor settings, where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds. The reputation for unseemly behavior, unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name, to the Venetian ridotto, but as \\"The Man of Taste\\" observed in 1733; > In Lent, if masquerades displease the town, > Call 'em Ridottos and they still go down.\\" A standard item of masquerade dress was a \\"Vandyke\\", improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of Van Dyck: Gainsborough's Blue Boy is the most familiar example, and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in England for portraits in fancy dress. Throughout the century, masquerade dances became popular in Colonial America. Its prominence did not go unchallenged; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves. The anti-masquerade writers (among them such notables as Samuel Richardson) held that the events encouraged immorality and \\"foreign influence.\\" While they were sometimes able to persuade authorities to their views, particularly after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, enforcement of measures designed to end masquerades was at best desultory, and the masquerades went on as semi-private \\"subscriptions.\\"Ribeiro 1978:3. In the 1770s, fashionable Londoners went to the masquerades organized by Teresa Cornelys at Carlisle House in Soho Square, and later to the Pantheon. Masquerade balls were sometimes set as a game among the guests. The masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable. This would create a type of game to see if a guest could determine each other's identities. This added a humorous effect to many masquerades and enabled a more enjoyable version of typical balls. One of the most noted masquerade balls of the 20th century was that held at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by Carlos de Beistegui. It was dubbed \\"the party of the century.\\" Another famous ball was The Black and White Ball. It held on November 28, 1966 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham.Davis, Deborah (2006). Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and His Black and White Ball. John Wiley & Sons. .  Masquerade masks  Masquerade masks were worn delicately by the prosperous class at balls. Masquerade masks had many uses including hiding one's identity, and using different colour to express one's freedom of speech and voice one's emotions and opinions without judgement. There were two types of base masquerade masks; black masks and white masks. Designs and patterns were created over the base that was chosen. The main types of masks included masks with a stick (which one could hold to keep the mask in front of their face), the head mask, the full-face mask, and the half face mask. From classics like The Phantom of the Opera and Romeo and Juliet to The Lone Ranger and Gossip Girl, masquerade masks have been, and are still used in many types of media today.  Contemporary revival  = In French Guiana = Touloulous in the Cayenne streets in 2007. Today, in French Guiana, throughout the Carnival period, masked balls (known as masked balls) take place every weekend. It is about Touloulous balls, where the Touloulous (women) is completely disguised and unrecognizable, where, recently this is the Tololos (men) who is disguised. = In the New World = A new resurgence of masquerade balls began in the late 1990s in North America. More recently, the party atmosphere is emphasized and the formal dancing usually less prominent. In present times, masquerade masks are used for costumes during Halloween. Masquerade masks are sold in a wide range of stores in different designs, and colors.  Cultural references  The picturesque quality of the masquerade ball has made it a favorite topic or setting in literature. Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" is based at a masquerade ball in which a central figure turns out to be his costume. A ball in Z√ºrich is featured in the novel Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse. A masquerade ball is central to the plot of Mikhail Lermontov's 1835 play Masquerade. The play was censored and never staged during Lermontov's lifetime, partly because of the implied criticism of the masquerade balls staged by the aristocratic Engelhardt family. The book, musical and most film adaptations of The Phantom of the Opera have a scene at a masked ball. The Phantom's (Erik's) costume is that of the Red Death from the aforementioned Edgar Allan Poe story The Masque of the Red Death. In the play Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, Romeo meets Juliet at a masquerade ball. The video game \\"Dishonored\\" has a mission called Lady Boyle's Last Party, taking place at a masquerade where the primary objective is discerning the identity of Lady Boyle, a masked party-goer. The video game \\"Assassin's Creed II\\" has a series of missions called Carnevale set during \\"Venetian Carnival\\" where the primary objective is to gain access to one of the more prestigious masquerade balls ending in the mission called Having a Blast which primarily takes place in the masquerade ball.

It stars Mickey Rooney, Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Cecilia Parker, Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Ann Rutherford, Mary Howard and Gene Reynolds. The screenplay was written by William Ludwig, from stories by Vivien R. Bretherton, and based upon characters created by Aurania Rouverol. It was directed by George B. Seitz. In 2000, Love Finds Andy Hardy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". This was the first film in which Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer recorded at least part of the soundtrack in stereophonic sound, a practice which was used for a number of MGM musical comedies beginning the late 1930s. The film was presented in standard monaural sound. Plot Judy Garland in the trailer for the film. It is December 1938 in the town of Carvel. Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) is putting a down payment on a used car, desperate to take his girlfriend Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) to the Christmas Eve dance in his own car. When Polly tells Andy she will be visiting her grandmother for the next three weeks and will not be able to attend the Christmas Eve dance with him, Andy vows to attend the dance alone. Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone), Andy‚Äôs father, later encounters his son, who broaches the subject of car ownership, but Judge Hardy tells Andy that he cannot have his own car. Returning home for the evening, Judge Hardy runs into 12-year-old Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), who is staying with her grandparents for the Christmas holiday. Betsy‚Äôs grandmother has been effusive about Andy Hardy and Betsy is thrilled to learn he will be her next door neighbor during her stay. Judge Hardy‚Äôs wife, Emily (Fay Holden), receives a telegram that evening informing her that her mother has had a stroke. Emily and her sister leave immediately for rural Canada to care for their mother. Andy meets Betsy while delivering some of his mother‚Äôs freshly canned preserves. Betsy is obviously taken with Andy but he does not reciprocate her admiration; he leaves as quickly as possible. Beezy (George P. Breakston), Andy‚Äôs friend, asks Andy to date Cynthia (Lana Turner), Beezy‚Äôs girlfriend, while Beezy is out of town over the Christmas holiday period, so that she will avoid other men. Beezy promises to pay Andy $8 plus 50 cents a week for expenses for his efforts. Andy needs the money to purchase his car, so he agrees. Andy starts going out with Cynthia, but she is bored by sports activities, and they find they only get along when they are busy kissing; after walking Cynthia home Andy stops in to visit Betsy Booth‚Äîonly he‚Äôs covered in Cynthia‚Äôs lipstick. Betsy gives Andy a handsome new radiator cap for his anticipated car, and, after he leaves, she sadly sings ‚ÄúIn-Between.‚Äù One morning, Andy receives a telegram from Polly saying she will be home for the Christmas Eve dance after all. Andy telephones her saying he can‚Äôt take her to the dance because of a previous engagement. He thereafter opens a letter from Beezy. Beezy wrote saying he found a new girlfriend so he will not pay Andy for dating Cynthia. Betsy, from a moneyed family, offers to help Andy pay for his car, but he refuses her aid. That evening, he tells his father about the mess he made. Judge Hardy explains his point of view about spending money on a car versus putting it aside as savings‚Äîand then discloses his deep concern for Andy‚Äôs mother. Judge Hardy would like to convey a message to his wife, but there is no telephone at her mother‚Äôs home and Emily finds telegrams unnerving. Lewis Stone, Mickey Rooney, and Fay Holden Andy suggests a message be sent to their mother via ham radio in lieu of sending her a telegram. Andy brings Judge Hardy to the home of twelve-year-old ham radio operator James McMann Jr. (Gene Reynolds) and he sends a message to Mrs. Hardy. Judge Hardy is so impressed with James‚Äôs help and his son‚Äôs ingenuity that he pays the last $8 for Andy‚Äôs car. Betsy deceives Cynthia into thinking that Andy‚Äôs car is an absolute wreck; Cynthia haughtily refuses to go to the Christmas Eve dance with Andy. Andy feels relieved to be able to date Polly again. Andy tries to clear things up with Polly but, having learned of his fling with Cynthia, she angrily tells Andy that she won‚Äôt go to the dance with him because she has a date with a college boy. Christmas Eve finds Andy wholly dejected at the prospect of not having a date for the dance‚Äîbut when Betsy comes over in her evening gown he decides to take her to the dance. At the dance, Polly‚Äôs date recognizes Betsy as an accomplished singer and asks her to perform; Andy is scared that she will embarrass him, but she proves to be a fantastic singer and quickly wins over the crowd with ‚ÄúIt Never Rains But it Pours‚Äù and encores with ‚ÄúMeet the Beat of My Heart.‚Äù Betsy and Andy lead the dance in a grand march after Polly leaves in tears. Late that evening at home after the dance, Betsy Booth and the Hardy family are gathered together around the Christmas tree when Mrs. Hardy unexpectedly returns home‚Äîher mother is getting better.

It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family. The film is an adaptation by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young of the play Le Tailleur au ch√¢teau (\\"The tailor at the castle\\") by Paul Armont and L√©opold Marchand. It features the classic Rodgers and Hart songs \\"Love Me Tonight\\", \\"Isn't it Romantic?\\", \\"Mimi\\", and \\"Lover\\". \\"Lover\\" is sung not romantically, as it often is in nightclubs, but comically, as MacDonald's character tries to control an unruly horse. The staging of \\"Isn't It Romantic?\\" was revolutionary for its time, combining both singing and film editing, as the song is passed from one singer (or group of singers) to another, all of whom are at different locales. In his book Hollywood in the Thirties, John Baxter declared ‚ÄúIf there is a better musical of the Thirties, one wonders what it can be.‚ÄùThe Films and Career of Maurice Chevalier (Gene Ringgold, Dewitt Bodeen, The Citadel Press, 1973), . P.110. In 1990, Love Me Tonight was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot The story describes an encounter between a Parisian tailor named Maurice Courtelin (Chevalier) and a family of local aristocrats. These include Vicomte Gilbert de Var√®ze (Ruggles), who owes Maurice a large amount of money for tailoring work; Gilbert's uncle the Duc d'Artelines (C. Aubrey Smith), the family patriarch; d'Artelines' man-hungry niece Valentine (Loy); and his other 22-year-old niece, Princesse Jeanette (MacDonald), who has been a widow for three years. D'Artelines has been unable to find Jeanette a new husband of suitable age and rank. The household also includes three aunts and an ineffectual suitor the Comte de Savignac (Butterworth). Maurice custom-tailors clothing for de Var√®ze on credit, but the Vicomte's unpaid tailoring bills become intolerable, so Maurice travels to de Savignac's castle to collect the money owed to him. On the way, he has a confrontation with Princesse Jeanette. He immediately professes his love for her, but she haughtily rejects him. Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier When Maurice arrives at the castle, Gilbert introduces him as \\"Baron Courtelin\\" in order to hide the truth from the Comte. Maurice is fearful of this scheme at first, but changes his mind when he sees Jeanette. While staying at the castle, he arouses Valentine's desire, charms the rest of the family except for Jeanette, saves a deer's life during a hunt, and continues to woo Jeanette. The Comte de Savignac discovers that Maurice is a fake, but the Vicomte then claims that Maurice is a royal who is traveling incognito for security reasons. Finally, Jeanette succumbs to Maurice's charms, telling him \\"Whoever you are, whatever you are, wherever you are, I love you.\\" When Maurice criticizes Jeanette's tailor, the family confronts him for his rudeness, only to catch him and Jeanette alone with Jeanette partially undressed. Maurice explains that he is redesigning Jeanette's riding outfit, and he proves this by successfully altering it, but in the process he is forced to reveal his true identity. Despite her earlier promise, Jeanette recoils from him and runs to her room on hearing that he is a commoner. The entire household is outraged, and Maurice leaves.

It features the Great Poochini (played by Butch Dog), a canine opera singer who spurns a magician. The magician is able to replace Poochini's normal conductor prior to the show through disguise. In 1993, Magical Maestro was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" making it the only Tex Avery cartoon so far to be inducted. Plot Mysto the Magician appeals to a snobbish opera singer, the Great Poochini (a pun on opera composer Giacomo Puccini), to let him perform an opening act at the show that night. Mysto's tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. After Mysto dances and asks him if he gets the job, Poochini emphatically says \\"NO!\\" as he kicks Mysto out the door into the alley. While on the ground, upsetter Mysto plays with his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass it off as a conductor's baton, being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Poochini. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair, then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Great Poochini, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him. During the performance, in which Poochini (performed by the Colombian baritone Carlos Julio Ram√≠rez) sings Largo al factotum from Gioacchino Rossini's 1816 opera The Barber of Seville, Mysto unleashes a variety of tricks with his wand. He begins tamely by summoning rabbits and flowers, then turning Poochini into a ballet dancer, Indian, tennis player, prisoner rock-breaker and football player. Mysto's revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Poochini's head, turning him Chinese (see below), then transforming him into a country singer and sings, Oh My Darling, Clementine. After levitating Poochini to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Poochini actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the \\"hair gag\\". Poochini is then transformed into a Shirley Temple-esque child (who sings \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\\" before the balloon blows up and pops), then a Carmen Miranda-type singer, singing \\"Mam√£e Eu Quero\\" (with two rabbits accompanying him on guitar) after an irritated audience member hurls an armload of fruit onto Poochini's head where it piles up like Miranda's headdress. The same man later sprays black ink on Poochini from a fountain pen, turning him into Bill Kenny from the Ink Spots, then drops an anvil on top of him, crushing him into a shorter height and deepening his voice to that of the Ink Spots' bass, \\"Hoppy\\" Jones (parodying the Ink Spots' famous \\"Top & Bottom\\" format). After a rabbit hoses off Poochini's face and another rabbit works his arm like an automobile jack to get him back up to full height, the fun continues as he is transformed into a Hawaiian singer with two rabbits for harmony. Reaching the end of the number, Mysto's plan is finally revealed to Poochini as his wig falls off. Mysto quickly puts the wig back on, but it's too late. Now set for revenge of his own, Poochini furiously grabs the hairpiece and puts it on while Mysto tries to flee, but Poochini, having also grabbed the magic wand, stops the magician by using the wand on him as placing Mysto to the stage and unleashes the same gimmicks on the hapless magician at high speed. A red curtain with the words \\"The End\\" then falls on the magician and the rabbits (at the end of the Hawaiian singer shtick) thus ending the cartoon. History The concept of cartoons with insinuating situations is hardly newTex Avery especially featured a few quick jokes of this nature in his cartoons. Magical Maestro, for example, shows Poochini with a male and female rabbit on each arm. He lowers his arms behind his back and when he raises them again, he now has an additional dozen baby rabbits on them, six on each arm. This cartoon features a gimmick only seen in Tex Avery films, the \\"hair gag\\". Because cartoons were shown originally in movie theatres, the film strip, if loaded incorrectly, would rub against the gate mechanism, shaving off tiny \\"hairs\\" of celluloid. These hairs would get caught in the 'gate' of the projector. Sometimes it would skitter across the projection light, resulting in a gigantic hair appearing on the movie screen. In this cartoon, the opera singer pauses mid-song to pluck the offending hair from the film and tosses it aside , one of Avery's many ways of his characters breaking the fourth wall. It wasn't the first time Avery used this gag. It was also used in Aviation Vacation (1941). The role of Poochini is portrayed by Butch the Irish dog, a frequent star of Avery's cartoons of that era (often alongside Droopy). Censorship Since its debut on television, Magical Maestro has frequently been shown with two gags missing, that were edited out due to their reliance on racial stereotypes. * Poochini is transformed into a Chinese stereotype when a cymbal is thrown on his head by the conductor, simulating the coolie hat which is wide and flat, with a point in the top. A repeat of this gag near the end of the cartoon (as Mysto is forced to sing and turns into the characters that Poochini was turned to thanks to the magic wand) was also cut. * An irritated audience member in a box seat right above the stage shows his distaste for the performance by spraying ink from a pen into Poochini's face, leaving him looking like a blackface singer singing in the style of The Ink Spots' Bill Kenny. When this does not shut him up, the audience member drops an anvil on Poochini's head, squashing him down and giving him a deeper voice reminiscent of The Ink Spots' Orville \\"Hoppy\\" Jones. The edited version shows the audience member about to drop the anvil on Poochini, then, disrupting the continuity, immediately cuts to the rabbits jacking him back up to normal height, having already washed the ink off his face. Magical Maestro was broadcast throughout the 1970s and 1980s in various formats, depending on censoring rules at the particular television station. New York‚Äìbased WPIX, for instance, edited out the audience member segment, but left the Chinese stereotype in place. Chicago-based WFLD (now FOX-32) as well as Atlanta-based WTBS (the future parent of Cartoon Network), aired the film uncut. The current edited version that has aired on Cartoon Network since the late 1990s is missing both gags. Influence The \\"hair gag\\" would later be used by English comedian Benny Hill in the closing chase sequence of his April 25, 1984 show. As he is being chased by medical staff and an ambulance in and around a hospital area, he notices a hair moving around the bottom right corner of the screen, and at a certain point stops his pursuers long enough for him to pluck the hair out before the chase resumes. Tom and Jerry Tales episode \\"Way-Off Broadway\\" features a gag similar to Poochini's transformations, in that Tom is forced to adapt to various pieces music when Jerry changes them on a radio.

The Apostolic Faith Mission of Portland was founded in 1906 by Florence L. Crawford, who was affiliated with William J. Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival of Los Angeles, California. By 1908 Crawford had independently founded what would become the Apostolic Faith Church. Since July 2000, the Superintendent General of the Apostolic Faith Church has been Darrel Lee. The Apostolic Faith Church has a presence in the United States, Canada and across Africa, Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and Australia. In 1997, the AFC had 2,013 members in 115 churches served by 188 clergy in the United States.The Association of Religious Data Archives profile on the Apostolic Faith Mission There are ten churches in Canada, several hundred in Africa (six-hundred in Nigeria alone), twenty throughout the Philippines and Korea, nine in Europe (Romania and Norway), and over sixty in the West Indies.Retrieved April 23, 2012. Apostolic Faith Church Church-affiliated groups also regularly assemble in other parts of the world and recently include India. In some locations, member churches carry the name Trinity Apostolic Faith Church in order to differentiate themselves from non- affiliated churches in the same area. History Atlanta, Georgia The founder of the Apostolic Faith Church was Florence L. Crawford. Crawford was a participant in the Azusa Street Revival. This revival began in 1906 at the Apostolic Faith Mission in Los Angeles. The Azusa Street Mission, as it was called, quickly became the center of the Apostolic Faith movement mainly through the publication of The Apostolic Faith newspaper. Seymour appointed Crawford as the state director of the Pacific Coast Apostolic Faith movement where she would help other missions and churches join the movement. Crawford's break with Seymour was complete by 1911. She began an independent work in Portland, Oregon, with the same name as Seymour's mission and most of the churches under her supervision followed her. This considerably weakened Seymour's undisputed leadership of the Apostolic Faith movement as most of the churches which had fed the movement chose alignment with Crawford. According to Crawford, the separation was necessitated by rumors that Seymour had abandoned the Wesleyan position that entire sanctification was a second work of grace after conversion. Crawford's mission gained further influence when Clara Lum, editor of The Apostolic Faith, transferred the paper, under controversial circumstances, to the Portland mission in mid-1908. The Apostolic Faith would become the Higher Way at a later date and is still published.http://www.apostolicfaith.org/aboutus/publishinghistory.asp , Retrieved August 10, 2008.

The company stated it would allow them to retain an unstated number of jobs. Doctrine Through the years, the Apostolic Faith Church's leaders have maintained the doctrines outlined in Seymour's editions of the Apostolic Faith papers printed in 1906 through 1908. As a Trinitarian and fundamental church, their doctrinal position centers on a born-again experience, supports the Wesleyan teaching of holiness (Christian perfection), and stresses the need of sanctified believers to receive the Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Their teachings are in direct conflict with Calvinistic beliefs regarding sin, predestination, and eternal security.

Production background Manhatta documents the look of early 20th-century Manhattan. With the city as subject, the film consists of 65 shots sequenced in a loose non-narrative structure, beginning with the Staten Island ferry approaching Manhattan and ending with a sunset view from a skyscraper. It is considered by some to be the first American avant-garde film. The primary objective of the film is to explore the relationship between photography and film; camera movement is kept to a minimum, as is incidental motion within each shot. Each frame provides a view of the city that has been carefully arranged into abstract compositions. Manhatta was a collaboration between painter/photographer Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. The intertitles include excerpts from the writings of Walt Whitman. Preservation status In 1995 the film was deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the Library of Congress, selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, and was restored for the DVD set Unseen Cinema in October 2005. The film was completely restored in January 2009 by archivist Bruce Posner, working with film restoration company Lowry Digital. Posner spent close to four years returning the film to its original glory. The Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives also commissioned a new score from New York composer Donald Sosin.

Joffe. The screenplay was written by Allen and Marshall Brickman. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl (Mariel Hemingway) but falls in love with his best friend (Michael Murphy)'s mistress (Diane Keaton). Meryl Streep and Anne Byrne also star. Manhattan was filmed in black-and-white and 2.35:1 widescreen. It features music by George Gershwin, including Rhapsody in Blue, which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of Annie Hall and Interiors. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Hemingway and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (adjusted for inflation). Often considered one of his best films, it ranks 46th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list and number 63 on Bravo's \\"100 Funniest Movies\\".Woody Allen ‚Äì Biography by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in The New York TimesArticle in New York by Bilge Ebiri on AFI Top 100 In 2001 the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot The film opens with a montage of images of Manhattan and other parts of New York City accompanied by George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, with Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a 17-year-old girl attending the Dalton School. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack (Michael Murphy), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah (Wallace Shawn), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis (Meryl Streep) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since come out as a lesbian and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig). When Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an Equal Rights Amendment fund-raising event at the Museum of Modern Art hosted by Bella Abzug (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through Central Park. After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a m√©nage √† trois Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds stoically and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him. In the d√©nouement, Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \\"life worth living\\". When he finds himself saying \\"Tracy's face\\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \\"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \\"not everybody gets corrupted\\" before saying \\"you have to have a little faith in people\\". He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of Rhapsody in Blue playing again. An instrumental version of \\"Embraceable You\\" plays over the credits. Cast Production =Development= According to Allen, the idea for Manhattan originated from his love of Gershwin's music. He was listening to one of the composer's albums of overtures and thought, \\"this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie\\". Allen has said that Manhattan was \\"like a mixture of what I was trying to do with Annie Hall and Interiors\\" and that it deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essentially junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of his \\"possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances,\\" adding that he has \\"rationalized [his] way out of it so far, but [he] could conceive of doing it.\\" =Filming= Allen talked to cinematographer Gordon Willis about how fun it would be to shoot the film in black and white, Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1) because it would give \\"a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film\\". Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white because that was how he remembered it from when he was small. \\"Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York.\\" He always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In Manhattan he really thinks that he and Willis succeeded in showing the city. \\"When seeing it there on that big screen, it's really decadent\\". The picture was shot on location with the exception of some of the scenes in the planetarium which were filmed on a set. The bridge shot The famous bridge shot was done at five in the morning. The production had to bring their own bench as there were no park benches at the location. The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and that he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterward, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take. After finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it. He offered to make a film for no fee instead. He later said, \\"I just thought to myself, 'At this point in my life, if this is the best I can do, they shouldn't give me money to make movies.'\\" =Music= All titles of the soundtrack were compositions by George Gershwin. They were performed by the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas. * New York Philharmonic  Rhapsody in Blue  \\"Love is Sweeping the Country\\"  \\"Land of the Gay Caballero\\"  \\"Sweet and Low Down\\"  \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\"  \\"Do-Do-Do\\"  \\"'S Wonderful\\"  \\"Oh, Lady Be Good!\\"  \\"Strike Up the Band\\"  \\"Embraceable You\\" * Buffalo Philharmonic  \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\"  \\"He Loves and She Loves\\"  \\"But Not for Me\\" A part of the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is heard in a concert scene.

It opened in 27 theaters in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto on April 25, then expanded to an additional 256 theaters nationwide on May 4, before adding a further 117 screens a week later. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival in May. Reception =Box office= The film grossed $485,734 ($16,749 per screen) in its opening weekend and after expanding nationwide, it had grossed $3.5 million after 13 days. It grossed $39.9 million in its entire run in the United States and Canada, making the film the 17th highest-grossing picture of the year. Adjusted for ticket price inflation (as of 2017), Manhattan grossed $141,484,800, making it Allen's second biggest box-office hit, following 1977's Annie Hall. =Critical response= The film received largely positive reviews and currently holds a rating of 95% \\"Certified Fresh\\" on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 65 critics. Gary Arnold, in The Washington Post, wrote: \\"Manhattan has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes at the expense of his own parochialism. There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sell-outs decorating the Hollywood landscape. The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness.\\" In his review for Newsweek magazine, Jack Kroll wrote: \\"Allen's growth in every department is lovely to behold. He gets excellent performances from his cast. The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen's yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental ‚Äì a balance also expressed in his best screen play [sic] yet.\\" In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote, \\"Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual. And Mariel Hemingway deserves some kind of special award for what's in some ways the most difficult role in the film.\\" Ebert included the film in his list of The Great Movies. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded a full four out of four stars, calling it \\"a remarkable motion picture.

More than that, he cast this shining city in the form of those movies that he might have seen as a child in Coney Island‚Äîfreeing the visions that he sensed to be locked up in the silver screen.\\" In October 2013, readers of The Guardian newspaper voted it the best film directed by Woody Allen. =Accolades= New York Film Critics Circle named Allen best director for Manhattan. The National Society of Film Critics also named Allen best director along with Robert Benton, who directed Kramer vs. Kramer. The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Best Original Screenplay (Allen and Marshall Brickman). It also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the C√©sar Award for Best Foreign Film. In Empire magazine's 2008 poll of the 500 greatest movies ever made, Manhattan was ranked number 76.

As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were letterboxed, originally with a gray border. Manhattan was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen's 1977 film Annie Hall. Both releases included the films' original theatrical trailer.

She performed a wide range of music, from classical music to spirituals. She performed with renowned orchestras in major concert and recital venues throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Anderson was an important figure in the struggle for African-American artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. The incident placed Anderson in the spotlight of the international community on a level unusual for a classical musician. With the aid of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in the capital. She sang before an integrated crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson was the first African-American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 7, 1955. In addition, she worked as a delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United States Department of State, giving concerts all over the world. She participated in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, singing at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Anderson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, the Congressional Gold Medal in 1977, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1978, the National Medal of Arts in 1986, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1991. Early life and education Marian Anderson was born on February 27, 1897, in Philadelphia, to John Berkley Anderson (c. 1872‚Äì1910) and Annie Delilah Rucker (1874‚Äì1964). Her father sold ice and coal at the Reading Terminal in downtown Philadelphia and eventually opened a small liquor business as well. Prior to her marriage, Anderson's mother had briefly attended the Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg and had worked as a schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and not white ones. She therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alyse (1899‚Äì1965) and Ethel (1902‚Äì90), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their son James Anderson DePreist was a noted conductor.Allan Keiler, Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey ‚Äì Chapter One, The New York Times, 2000 (subscription access) Anderson in 1920 Anderson's parents were both devout Christians and the whole family was active in the Union Baptist Church in South Philadelphia. Marian's aunt Mary, her father's sister, was particularly active in the church's musical life and convinced her niece to join the junior church choir at the age of six. In that role she got to perform solos and duets, often with her aunt Mary. Aunt Mary took Marian to concerts at local churches, the YMCA, benefit concerts, and other community music events throughout the city. Anderson credited her aunt's influence as the reason she pursued her singing career. Beginning as young as six, her aunt arranged for Marian to sing for local functions where she was often paid 25 or 50 cents for singing a few songs. As she got into her early teens, Marian began to make as much as four or five dollars for singing; a considerable amount of money for the early 20th century. At the age of 10, Marian joined the People's Chorus of Philadelphia under the direction of singer Emma Azalia Hackley, where she was often a soloist. When Anderson was 12, her father was accidentally struck on the head while working at the Reading Terminal before Christmas 1909. He died of heart failure a month later at age 34. Marian and her family moved into the home of her father's parents, Grandpa Benjamin and Grandma Isabella Anderson. Her grandfather had been born a slave and had experienced emancipation in the 1860s. He was the first of the Anderson family to settle in South Philadelphia, and when Anderson moved into his home the two became very close. He died just a year after the family moved in. Anderson attended Stanton Grammar School, graduating in the summer of 1912. Her family, however, could neither afford to send her to high school, nor could they pay for any music lessons. Still, Anderson continued to perform wherever she could and learn from anyone who was willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the Camp Fire Girls which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually, the directors of the People's Chorus of Philadelphia and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend South Philadelphia High School, from which she graduated in 1921. After high school, Anderson applied to an all-white music school, the Philadelphia Music Academy (now University of the Arts), but was turned away because she was black. The woman working the admissions counter replied, \\"We don't take colored\\" when she tried to apply. Undaunted, Anderson pursued studies privately in her native city through the continued support of the Philadelphia black community, first with Agnes Reifsnyder, then Giuseppe Boghetti. She met Boghetti through the principal of her high school. Anderson auditioned for him singing \\"Deep River\\" and he was immediately brought to tears. Boghetti scheduled a recital of English, Russian, Italian and German music at The Town Hall in New York City in April 1924 which took place in an almost empty hall and received poor reviews. Early career In 1925 Anderson got her first big break when she won first prize in a singing competition sponsored by the New York Philharmonic. As the winner she got to perform in concert with the orchestra on August 26, 1925, a performance that scored immediate success with both audience and music critics. Anderson remained in New York to pursue further studies with Frank La Forge. During this time Arthur Judson became her manager. They met through the New York Philharmonic. Over the next several years, she made a number of concert appearances in the United States, but racial prejudice prevented her career from gaining momentum. In 1928, she sang for the first time at Carnegie Hall. =Rosenwald fund= During her fall 1929 concert schedule, Anderson sang at Orchestra Hall in Chicago. The performance was greeted with measured praise. Critic Herman Devries from the Chicago Evening American wrote, \\"[Anderson] reached near perfection in every requirement of vocal art‚Äîthe tone was of superb timbre, the phrasing of utmost refinement, the style pure, discreet, musicianly. But after this there was a letdown, and we took away the impression of a talent still unripe, but certainly a talent of potential growth.\\" In the audience were two representatives from Julius Rosenwald's philanthropic organization, Rosenwald Fund. The organization's representatives Ray Field and George Arthur encouraged Anderson to apply for a Rosenwald Fellowship, through which she received fifteen-hundred dollars to study in Berlin. =European tours= Anderson went to Europe where she spent a number of months studying with Sara Charles-Cahier before launching a highly successful European singing tour. In the summer of 1930, she went to Scandinavia, where she met the Finnish pianist Kosti Vehanen who became her regular accompanist and her vocal coach for many years. She also met Jean Sibelius through Vehanen after he had heard her in a concert in Helsinki. Moved by her performance, Sibelius invited them to his home and asked his wife to bring champagne in place of the traditional coffee. Sibelius commented to Anderson of her performance that he felt that she had been able to penetrate the Nordic soul. The two struck up an immediate friendship, which further blossomed into a professional partnership, and for many years Sibelius altered and composed songs for Anderson to perform. He created a new arrangement of the song \\"Solitude\\" and dedicated it to Anderson in 1939. Originally The Jewish Girl's Song from his 1906 incidental music to Belshazzar's Feast, it later became the \\"Solitude\\" section of the orchestral suite derived from the incidental music. In 1933, Anderson made her European debut in a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, where she was received enthusiastically. She spent the early 1930s touring throughout Europe where she did not encounter the racial prejudices she had experienced in America. Anderson, accompanied by Vehanen, continued to tour throughout Europe during the mid-1930s. She visited Eastern European capitals and Russia and returned again to Scandinavia, where \\"Marian fever\\" had spread to small towns and villages where she had thousands of fans. She quickly became a favorite of many conductors and composers of major European orchestras.Max de Schauensee/Alan Blyth: \\"Marian Anderson\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy, accessed February 9, 2009 During a 1935 tour in Salzburg, the conductor Arturo Toscanini told her she had a voice \\"heard once in a hundred years.\\" = American tours = In 1934, impresario Sol Hurok offered Anderson a better contract than she previously had with Arthur Judson. He became her manager for the rest of her performing career and through his persuasion she came back to perform in America. In 1935, Anderson made her second recital appearance at The Town Hall in New York City, which received highly favorable reviews by music critics. She spent the next four years touring throughout the United States and Europe. She was offered opera roles by several European houses but, due to her lack of acting experience, Anderson declined all of those offers. She did, however, record a number of opera arias in the studio, which became bestsellers. Anderson's accomplishments as a singer did not make her immune to Jim Crow laws in the 1930s. While she gave about 70 recitals a year in the United States, Anderson was still denied rooms in certain American hotels and was not allowed to eat in certain American restaurants. Because of this discrimination, Albert Einstein, a champion of racial tolerance, hosted Anderson on many occasions, the first being in 1937 when she was denied a hotel before performing at Princeton University. She last stayed with him months before he died in 1955.Walter Isaacson, Einstein: His Life and Universe, Simon & Schuster, 2007, p. 445., Arte, documentary, Germany 2015 =1939 Lincoln Memorial concert= Anderson in her 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) denied permission to Anderson for a concert on April 9 at Constitution Hall under a \\"white performers-only\\" policy in effect at the time. In addition to the policy on performers, Washington, D.C., was a segregated city, and black patrons were upset that they would have to sit at the back of Constitution Hall. Furthermore, Constitution Hall did not have the segregated public bathrooms required by DC law at the time for such events. Other DC venues were not an option; the District of Columbia Board of Education declined a request to use the auditorium of a white public high school. Charles Edward Russell, a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and chair of the DC citywide Inter- Racial Committee, convened a meeting on the following day that formed the Marian Anderson Citizens Committee (MACC) composed of several dozen organizations, church leaders and individual activists in the city, including the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the Washington Industrial Council- CIO, American Federation of Labor, and the National Negro Congress. MACC elected Charles Hamilton Houston as its chairman and on February 20, the group picketed the board of education, collected signatures on petitions, and planned a mass protest at the next board of education meeting. Mitchell Jamieson's 1943 mural An Incident in Contemporary American Life, at the United States Department of the Interior Building, depicts the scene of Anderson's concert at the Lincoln Memorial As a result of the ensuing furor, thousands of DAR members, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, resigned from the organization.Mark Leibovich, \\"Rights vs. Rights: An Improbable Collision Course\\", The New York Times, January 13, 2008.Allan Kozinn, \\"Marian Anderson Is Dead at 96; Singer Shattered Racial Barriers\\", The New York Times, April 9, 1993. In her letter to the DAR, Roosevelt wrote, \\"I am in complete disagreement with the attitude taken in refusing Constitution Hall to a great artist... You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me that your organization has failed.\\"\\"Biography: Marian Anderson\\", American Experience, PBS Author Zora Neale Hurston criticized Eleanor Roosevelt's public silence about the similar decision by the District of Columbia Board of Education.Zora Neale Hurston, \\"A Negro Voter Sizes Up Taft\\", The Saturday Evening Post, December 8, 1951, pp. 151‚Äì52. As the controversy grew, the American press overwhelmingly backed Anderson's right to sing. The Philadelphia Tribune wrote, \\"A group of tottering old ladies, who don't know the difference between patriotism and putridism, have compelled the gracious First Lady to apologize for their national rudeness.\\" The Richmond Times- Dispatch wrote, \\"In these days of racial intolerance so crudely expressed in the Third Reich, an action such as the D.A.R.‚Äôs ban. . . seems all the more deplorable.\\" Marian Anderson greeting members of the audience at the ceremony held in the auditorium of the U.S. Department of the Interior, 1943At Eleanor Roosevelt's behest,Eleanor Roosevelt and Marian Anderson, Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum President Roosevelt and Walter White, then-executive secretary of the NAACP, and Anderson's manager, impresario Sol Hurok, persuaded Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes to arrange an open-air concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The concert was performed on Easter Sunday, April 9, and Anderson was accompanied, as usual, by Vehanen. They began the performance with a dignified and stirring rendition of \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\\" The event attracted a crowd of more than 75,000 in addition to a national radio audience of millions. Two months later, in conjunction with the 30th NAACP conference in Richmond, Virginia, Eleanor Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio (NBC and CBS) and presented Anderson with the 1939 Spingarn Medal for distinguished achievement. In 2001, a subsequent documentary film of the event has been selected for the National Film Registry, and NBC radio coverage of the event has been selected for the National Recording Registry. Mid-career Anderson at the Department of the Interior in 1943, commemorating her 1939 concert Anderson christens Liberty ship SS Booker T. Washington, 1942 During World War II and the Korean War, Anderson entertained troops in hospitals and bases. In 1943, she sang at the Constitution Hall at the invitation of the DAR to an integrated audience as part of a benefit for the American Red Cross. She said of the event, \\"When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall, I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there.\\" By contrast, the District of Columbia Board of Education continued to bar her from using the high school auditorium in the District of Columbia. = Ford 50th Anniversary Show = On June 15, 1953, Anderson headlined The Ford 50th Anniversary Show that was broadcast live from New York City on both NBC and CBS. Midway through the program, she sang \\"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\\". She returned to close the program with her rendition of the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\". The program attracted an audience of 60 million viewers. Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled the broadcast as both \\"a landmark in television\\" and \\"a milestone in the cultural life of the '50s\\". = The Metropolitan Opera = On January 7, 1955, Anderson became the first African-American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. At the invitation of director Rudolf Bing, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (opposite Zinka Milanov and Herva Nelli, as Amelia). Anderson said later about the evening, \\"The curtain rose on the second scene and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot.\\" Although she never appeared with the company again after this production, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning, which became a bestseller. = Presidential inaugurations and goodwill ambassador tours = In 1957, she sang for President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration, toured India and the Far East as a goodwill ambassador through the U.S. State Department and the American National Theater and Academy. She traveled in 12 weeks, giving 24 concerts. After that, President Eisenhower appointed her as a delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The same year, she was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1958 she was officially designated delegate to the United Nations, a formalization of her role as \\"goodwill ambassadress\\" of the U.S. which she had played earlier. On January 20, 1961 she sang for President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, and in 1962 she performed for President Kennedy and other dignitaries in the East Room of the White House, and also toured Australia.\\"Marian Anderson Calls on Kennedy at White House\\", The New York Times, March 23, 1962. She was active in supporting the civil rights movement during the 1960s, giving benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. In 1963, she sang at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. That same year she received one of the newly reinstituted Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is awarded for \\"especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interest of the United States, World Peace or cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\\" She also released her album, Snoopycat: The Adventures of Marian Anderson's Cat Snoopy, which included short stories and songs about her beloved black cat.Snoopycat Album Details at Smithsonian Folkways That same year Anderson concluded her farewell tour, after which she retired from public performance. The international tour began at Constitution Hall on Saturday October 24, 1964, and ended at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. In 1965, she christened the nuclear-powered ballistic- missile submarine, . Later life Painting by Betsy Graves Reyneau Although Anderson retired from singing in 1965, she continued to appear publicly. She often narrated Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait with her nephew James DePriest conducting. In 1976, Copland conducted a performance with the Philadelphia Orchestra at Saratoga. Her achievements were recognized and honored with many prizes, including the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit in 1973; the United Nations Peace Prize, New York City's Handel Medallion, and the Congressional Gold Medal, all in 1977; Kennedy Center Honors in 1978; the George Peabody Medal in 1981; the National Medal of Arts in 1986; and a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1991. A half-ounce gold commemorative medal was embossed with her portrait by the United States Treasury Department in 1980; and in 1984, she was the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. She has been awarded twenty-four honorary doctoral degrees from Howard University, Temple University, Smith College, and many others. Personal life On July 17, 1943, in Bethel, Connecticut, Anderson married architect Orpheus H. Fisher (1900‚Äì86), known as King. Fisher had asked her to marry him when they were teenagers. The wedding was a private ceremony performed by United Methodist pastor Rev. Jack Grenfell and was the subject of a short story titled \\"The 'Inside' Story\\" written by Rev. Grenfell's wife, Dr. Clarine Coffin Grenfell, in her book Women My Husband Married, including Marian Anderson.Clarine Coffin Grenfell, Lornagrace Grenfell Stuart, Women My Husband Married, including Marian Anderson , Grenfell Reading Center, 2000, . WACs on the stage of the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium, 1945. According to Dr. Grenfell, the wedding was originally supposed to take place in the parsonage, but because of a bake sale on the lawn of the Bethel United Methodist Church, the ceremony was moved at the last minute to the Elmwood Chapel, on the site of the Elmwood Cemetery in Bethel, in order to allow the event to remain private. By this marriage she had a stepson, James Fisher, from her husband's previous marriage to Ida Gould. The couple purchased a farm in Danbury, Connecticut, three years earlier in 1940 after an exhaustive search throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Through the years Fisher built many structures on the property, including an acoustic rehearsal studio he designed for his wife. The property remained Anderson's home for almost 50 years.William H. Honan, \\"For a Legend, A Fitting Encore\\", The New York Times, March 9, 2003. From 1940 she resided at a 50-acre farm, having sold half of the original 100 acres that she named Marianna Farm.Colebrook, Jessica, Travel Stories: Marian Anderson Studio , Connecticut Office of Tourism (2013). The farm was on Joe's Hill Road, in the Mill Plain section of Danbury in western Danbury. She constructed a three- bedroom ranch house as a residence, and she used a separate one-room structure as her studio. In 1996, the farm was named one of 60 sites on the Connecticut Freedom Trail. The studio was moved to downtown Danbury as the Marian Anderson studio.Jay Axelbank, \\"Rare Voice, Gracious Neighbor\\", The New York Times, November 23, 1997I-84, NY Croads. As a town resident Anderson wished to live as normally as possible, declining offers to be treated in restaurants and stores as a celebrity. She was known to visit the Danbury State Fair. She sang at the city hall on the occasion of the lighting of Christmas ornaments. She gave a concert at the Danbury High School. She served on the boards of the Danbury Music Center and supported the Charles Ives Center for the Arts and the Danbury Chapter of the NAACP. In 1986, Anderson's husband, Orpheus Fisher, died after 43 years of marriage. Anderson remained in residence at Marianna Farm until 1992, one year before her death. Although the property was sold to developers, various preservationists as well as the City of Danbury fought to protect Anderson's studio. Their efforts proved successful and the Danbury Museum and Historical Society received a grant from the State of Connecticut, relocated the structure, restored it, and opened it to the public in 2004. In addition to seeing the studio, visitors can see photographs and memorabilia from milestones in Anderson's career.Alice DuBois, \\"Travel Advisory; A Place to Remember Marian Anderson\\", The New York Times, September 26, 2004.

Marian Anderson Award The Marian Anderson Award was originally established in 1943 by Anderson after she was awarded the $10,000 Bok Prize that year by the city of Philadelphia. Anderson used the award money to establish a singing competition to help support young singers. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money and disbanded in 1976. In 1990, the award was re-established and has dispensed $25,000 annually. In 1998, the Marian Anderson Award prize money was restructured to be given to an established artist, not necessarily a singer, who exhibits leadership in a humanitarian area.About the Award , MarianAndersonaward.org  See also  *List of African-American firsts *List of rallies and protest marches in Washington, D.C.

Divided into a series of seasonal vignettes, starting with Summer 1903, it relates the story of a year in the life of the Smith family in St. Louis, leading up to the opening of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (more commonly referred to as the World's Fair) in the spring of 1904.Variety film review; November 1, 1944, page 10.Harrison's Reports film review; November 4, 1944, page 178. The film stars Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Tom Drake, Leon Ames, Marjorie Main, June Lockhart, and Joan Carroll. The film was adapted by Irving Brecher and Fred F. Finklehoffe from a series of short stories by Sally Benson, originally published in The New Yorker magazine under the title \\"5135 Kensington\\", and later in novel form as Meet Me in St. Louis. The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, who met Garland on the set and later married her. A major success with both critics and audiences, Meet Me in St. Louis was the second-highest grossing picture of 1944, only behind Going My Way, and was also MGM's most successful musical of the 1940s. In 1994, the film was deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Garland debuted the standards \\"The Trolley Song\\", \\"The Boy Next Door\\", and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", all of which became hits after the film was released. Arthur Freed, the producer of the film, also wrote and performed one of the songs. Plot Margaret O'Brien and Judy Garland perform the song \\"Under the Bamboo Tree\\" in Meet Me in St. Louis Margaret O'Brien and Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis The backdrop for the film is St. Louis, Missouri in the year leading up to the 1904 World's Fair. It is summer 1903. The Smith family leads a comfortable upper-middle class life. Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames) and his wife Anna (Mary Astor) have four daughters: Rose (Lucille Bremer), Esther (Judy Garland), Agnes (Joan Carroll), and Tootie (Margaret O'Brien); and a son, Lon Jr. (Henry H. Daniels, Jr.). Esther, the second eldest daughter, is in love with the boy next door, John Truitt (Tom Drake), although he does not notice her at first. Tootie was with Mr Neely and disputing that St Louis was the best city. Rose is expecting a phone call during which she hopes to be proposed to by Warren Sheffield (Robert Sully), and is embarrassed when not only does Warren fail to propose, but the entire family is present as she takes the call during dinner. Esther finally gets to meet John properly when he is a guest at the Smiths' house party, although her chances of romancing him don't go as planned when, after all the guests are gone and he is helping her turn off the gas lamps throughout the house, he tells her she uses the same perfume as his grandmother and that she has \\"a mighty strong grip for a girl.\\" Esther hopes to meet John again the following Friday on a trolley ride from the city to the construction site of the World's Fair. Esther is sad when the trolley sets off without any sign of him, but cheers up when she sees him running to catch the trolley mid-journey. On Halloween, Tootie and Agnes were getting ready to go out for the night, Tootie was suggesting that she will help and was forced to make Mr Braukoff uncomfortable and she runs away declaring that she was the bravest of them all. When Rose sees Esther and discusses what happened and both of them were heading back inside, all of a sudden Tootie returns home injured, claiming that John Truitt attacked her. Without bothering to investigate, Esther confronts John, physically attacking him and scolding him for being a \\"bully.\\" When Esther returns home, Tootie confesses that what really happened was that John was trying to protect Tootie and Agnes from the police after a dangerous prank they pulled went wrong. Upon learning the truth, Esther immediately dashes to John's house next door to apologize, and they share their first kiss. Mr. Smith announces to the family that he is to be sent to New York City on business and they will all move after Christmas. The family is devastated and upset at the news of the move, especially Rose and Esther whose romances, friendships, and educational plans are threatened. Esther is also aghast because they will miss the World's Fair. An elegant ball takes place on Christmas Eve. Esther is devastated when John cannot take her as his date, due to his leaving his tuxedo at the tailor's and being unable to get it back. She is relieved, however, when her grandfather (Harry Davenport) offers to take her to the ball instead. At the ball, Esther and Rose plot to ruin the evening of Warren's date and Rose's rival Lucille Ballard (June Lockhart) by filling up her dance card with losers. But when Lucille turns out to be interested in Lon, leaving Rose and Warren together, Esther switches her dance card with Lucille's and instead dances in Lucille's place with the clumsy and awkward partners. After being rescued by Grandpa, Esther is overjoyed when John unexpectedly turns up after somehow managing to obtain a tuxedo, and the pair dance together for the rest of the evening. Later on, John proposes to Esther and she accepts, but their future is uncertain because she must still move to New York. Esther returns home to an upset Tootie. She is soothed by the poignant \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" Tootie, however, becomes more upset at the prospect of the family's move and runs downstairs, out into the cold to destroy the snowmen they have made as she was not looking forward to living in New York. Mr. Smith sees his daughter's upsetting outburst from an upstairs window. Mr. Smith later announces that the family will not leave St. Louis after all when he realizes how much the move will affect his family. Warren boldly declares his love for Rose, stating that they will marry at the first possible opportunity. On or after April 30, 1904, the family take two horse-drawn buggies to the World's Fair. The film ends that night with the entire family (including John, Lucille, and Warren) overlooking the Grand Lagoon at the center of the World's Fair just as thousands of lights illuminate the grand pavilions.

The lyrics for \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" were originally different. The lyricist, Hugh Martin, wrote opening lyrics which were deemed too depressing by Judy Garland, Tom Drake, and Vincente Minnelli (they were: \\"Have yourself a merry little Christmas / It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past\\"), so Martin changed the lyrics. :(Years after the movie's release, additional lyric changes were made for Frank Sinatra, who objected to the song's generally downbeat tone. The most notable changes included \\"Next year\\" becoming \\"From now on\\", \\"Once again, as in olden days / Happy golden days of yore / Faithful friends that were dear to us / Will be near to us once more\\" becoming \\"Here we are, as in olden days / Happy golden days of yore / Faithful friends that are dear to us / Gather near to us once more\\", and \\"Someday soon we all will be together / If the fates allow / Until then we'll just have to muddle through somehow\\" becoming \\"Through the years we all will be together / If the fates allow / Hang a shining star upon the highest bough\\". This revised version is the one now most commonly performed.) =Deleted song= Garland's pre-recording of \\"Boys and Girls Like You and Me\\" survives today, but the cut film footage has been lost. This song was originally composed by Rodgers & Hammerstein for their Broadway musical Oklahoma! but cut prior to its opening.\\"Great Songs Cut From Broadway Shows\\" at vulture.com Reception The film's trailer Upon its 1944 release, Meet Me in St. Louis was a massive critical and commercial success. During its initial theatrical release, it earned a then-massive $5,016,000 in the US and Canada and $1,550,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $2,359,000. The film was a New York Times Critics' Pick: after seeing it at the Astor Theatre, Bosley Crowther called it \\"a warm and beguiling picturization based on Sally Benson's memoirs of her folks ... The Smiths and their home, in Technicolor, are eyefuls of scenic delight, and the bursting vitality of their living inspires you like vitamin A. Miss Garland is full of gay exuberance as the second sister of the lot and sings, as we said, with a rich voice that grows riper and more expressive in each new film. Her chortling of \\"The Trolley Song\\" puts fresh zip into that inescapable tune, and her romantic singing of a sweet one, \\"The Boy Next Door,\\" is good for mooning folks.\\" Crowther concludes: \\"As a comparable screen companion to Life With Father, we would confidently predict that Meet Me in St. Louis has a future that is equally bright. In the words of one of the gentlemen, it is a ginger-peachy show.\\" Time called it \\"one of the year's prettiest pictures\\"; \\"Technicolor has seldom been more affectionately used than in its registrations of the sober mahoganies and tender muslins and benign gaslights of the period. Now & then, too, the film gets well beyond the charm of mere tableau for short flights in the empyrean of genuine domestic poetry. These triumphs are creditable mainly to the intensity and grace of Margaret O'Brien and to the ability of director Minnelli & Co. to get the best out of her.\\" O'Brien drew further praise from Time; \\" [her] song and her cakewalk done in a nightgown at a grown-up party, are entrancing acts. Her self-terrified Halloween adventures richly set against firelight, dark streets, and the rusty confabulations of fallen leaves, bring this section of the film very near the first-rate.\\" Writing in The New Yorker, Wolcott Gibbs praised the film as \\"extremely attractive\\" and called the dialogue \\"funny in a sense rather rare in the movies,\\" although he thought it was too long. In 2005, Richard Schickel included the film on Time.com's ALL-TIME 100 best films, saying \\"It had wonderful songs [and] a sweetly unneurotic performance by Judy Garland....Despite its nostalgic charm, Minnelli infused the piece with a dreamy, occasionally surreal, darkness and it remains, for some of us, the greatest of American movie musicals.\\" Arthur Freed: \\"Meet Me in St. Louis is my personal favourite. I got along wonderfully with Judy, but the only time we were ever on the outs was when we did this film. She didn't want to do the picture. Even her mother came to me about it. We bumped into some trouble with some opinions ‚Äì Eddie Mannix, the studio manager, thought the Halloween sequence was wrong, but it was left in. There was a song that Rodgers and Hammerstein had written, called Boys and Girls Like You and Me, that Judy did wonderfully, but it slowed up the picture and it was cut out. After the preview of the completed film, Judy came over to me and said, \\"Arthur remind me not to tell you what kind of pictures to make.\\" [It] was the biggest grosser Metro had up to that time, except for Gone With the Wind.\\"Films of Judy Garland, Joe Morella & Edward Epstein Cadillac Publishing, 1969 The film currently holds a 100% \\"Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews with an average score of 8.69/10. The site's critics consensus for the film reads, \\"A disarmingly sweet musical led by outstanding performances from Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien, Meet Me in St. Louis offers a holiday treat for all ages.\\" Accolades \\"The Trolley Song\\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. Margaret O'Brien won an Academy Juvenile Award for her screen work in 1944. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, and Best Music, Song (Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin for \\"The Trolley Song\\"). Margaret O'Brien received an Academy Juvenile Award for her work that year, in which she appeared in several movies along with Meet Me in St. Louis. In 1994, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked the film 10th on AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals; two songs from the film made AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs (\\"The Trolley Song\\" at #26 and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" at #76). Gerald Kaufman wrote a study of the film, with the same title, which was published by the British Film Institute in 1994. Adaptations * Meet Me in St. Louis was remade in 1959 for television, starring Jane Powell, Jeanne Crain, Patty Duke, Walter Pidgeon, Ed Wynn, Tab Hunter and Myrna Loy. It was directed by George Schaefer from the original Brecher and Finklehoffe screenplay. * Meet Me in St. Louis was remade again for television in 1966. This was a non-musical version starring Shelley Fabares, Celeste Holm, Larry Merrill, Judy Land, Reta Shaw, Tammy Locke and Morgan Brittany. It was directed by Alan D. Courtney from a script written by Sally Benson herself. This was to be a pilot for a TV series, but no network picked it up. It was later included as a special feature on the 2 disc DVD set released in 2004. * A Broadway musical based on the film was produced in 1989, with additional songs. The late-19th century vintage carousel in this movie could be found at the Boblo Island Amusement Park in Amherstburg, Ontario until the park closed in September 1993. It was dismantled and sold to private collectors.

The film's narrative is circular and repeats several motifs, including a flower on a long driveway, a key falling, a door unlocked, a knife in a loaf of bread, a mysterious Grim Reaper‚Äìlike cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, a phone off the hook and an ocean. Through creative editing, distinct camera angles, and slow motion, the surrealist film depicts a world in which it is more and more difficult to catch reality. In 1990, Meshes of the Afternoon was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\", going into the registry in the second year of voting. In 2015 the BBC named the film the 40th greatest American movie ever made.\\"The 100 Greatest American Films\\", BBC Culture, July 20, 2015. Plot Meshes of the Afternoon A woman (Maya Deren) sees someone on the street as she is walking back to her home. She goes to her room and sleeps on a chair. As soon as she is asleep, she experiences a dream in which she repeatedly tries to chase a mysterious hooded figure with a mirror for a face but is unable to catch it. With each failure, she re-enters her house and sees numerous household objects including a key, a bread knife, a flower, a telephone and a phonograph. The woman follows the hooded figure to her bedroom where she sees the figure hide the knife under a pillow. Throughout the story, she sees multiple instances of herself, all bits of her dream that she has already experienced. The woman tries to kill her sleeping body with a knife but is awakened by a man (Alexander Hammid). The man leads her to the bedroom and she realizes that everything she saw in the dream was actually happening. She notices that the man's posture is similar to that of the hooded figure when it hid the knife under the pillow. She attempts to injure him and fails. Towards the end of the film the man walks into the house and sees a broken mirror being dropped onto wet ground. He then sees the woman in the chair, who was previously sleeping, but is now dead. Background and production The film was the product of Deren's and Hammid's desire to create an avant garde personal film that dealt with devastating psychological problems, like the French surrealist films of the 1920s such as Salvador Dal√≠ and Luis Bu√±uel's Un Chien Andalou (1929) and L'Age d'Or (1930). Deren and Hammid wrote, directed and performed in the film. Although Deren is usually credited as its principal artistic creator, filmmaker Stan Brakhage, who knew the couple, has claimed in his book Film at Wit's End that Meshes was in fact largely Hammid's creation, and that their marriage began to suffer when Deren received more credit. Other sources claim that Alexander Hammid's role in the creation of Meshes of the Afternoon is mainly as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are mostly attributable to Deren. Hammid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of Meshes of the Afternoon. The original print had no score. However, a musical score influenced by classical Japanese music was added in 1959 by Deren's third husband, Teiji Ito. Analysis In the early 1970s, J. Hoberman claimed that Meshes of the Afternoon was \\"less related to European surrealism\\" and more related to \\"Hollywood wartime film noir\\". Deren explained that Meshes \\"...is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.\\" =Lewis Jacobs's discussion= Writing about Meshes of the Afternoon, Lewis Jacobs credits Maya Deren with being the first film maker since the end of the war to \\"inject a fresh note into experimental film production\\". Further in his discussion of experimental cinema in postwar America, Jacobs says the film \\"attempted to show the way in which an apparently simple and casual occurrence develops subconsciously into a critical and emotional experience. A girl comes home one afternoon and falls asleep. In a dream she sees herself returning home, tortured by loneliness and frustration and impulsively committing suicide. The story has a double climax, in which it appears that the imagined, the dream, has become real.‚Äù Deren uses specific cinematic devices in this film to convey deeper meaning. In a particular scene, Deren is walking up a normal set of stairs, and each time she pushes against the wall, it triggers the camera to move in that direction, almost as if the camera is part of her body. As she pulls herself up the last stair, the top of the stairs leads her to a window in her bedroom, which completely breaks the expectations of the viewer. In doing so, Deren completely destroys normal sense of time and space. There is no longer a sense of what the space is that she is in, nor for how long she was there. Deren constantly asks the viewer to pay attention and remember certain things by repeating the same actions over and over with only very subtle changes. In Meshes of the Afternoon, repeated images are of the knife in the bread, the phone off the hook, the key, and the record player as Deren goes about performing the same actions. Deren uses familiar images to trigger memory. A recognizable trait of Deren's work is her use of the subjective and objective camera. For instance, shots in Meshes of the Afternoon cut from Deren looking at an object, to Deren's point of view, looking at herself perform the same actions that she has been making throughout the film. This conveys the meaning of Deren's dual personality or ambivalent feelings towards the possibility of suicide. It is Lewis Jacobs' opinion that \\"the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing.\\" An example of Jacobs' comment would be when Deren cuts to her point of view, which normally is an objective shot, but in this POV shot she is watching herself, which is subjective. The viewer cannot expect Deren's POV shot to contain herself. =Joseph Brinton's discussion= In Joseph Brinton‚Äôs 1947 essay \\"Subjective Camera or Subjective Audience\\", he states that \\"the symbolic picturization of man‚Äôs subconscious in Maya Deren‚Äôs experimental films suggest that the subjective camera can explore subtleties hitherto unimaginable as film content. As the new technique can clearly express almost any facet of everyday human experience, its development should presage a new type of psychological film in which the camera will reveal the human mind, not superficially, but honestly in terms of image and sound.\\" Jacobs' critique that \\"the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing\\", represents one point of view. However, others take the film's approach to be a direct representation on the character's thought patterns in a time of crisis: \\"Such a film should indeed endow the cinema with a wholly new dimension of subjective experience, permitting the audience to see a human being both as others see him and as he sees himself.\\" =Museum of Modern Art= In the Museum of Modern Art retrospective (2010), it was suggested that the pieces of the mirror falling into the ocean waves set up At Land (1944) as a direct sequel, while Deren's last scene in the latter film (running with her hands up with a chess piece in one of them) is then echoed by a scene in Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946) with that character still running. Influence A cloaked, mirror-faced figure appears in John Coney's 1974 Sun Ra vehicle, Space Is the Place, Yeasayer's video for \\"Ambling Alp\\", and Janelle Mon√°e's video for \\"Tightrope\\". The dreamlike (or nightmarish) atmosphere of Meshes has influenced many subsequent films, notably David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997). Wendy Haslem of the University of Melbourne's Cinema Studies department wrote about the parallels between the two: > Maya Deren was a key figure in the development of the New American Cinema. > Her influence extends to contemporary filmmakers like David Lynch, whose > film Lost Highway (1997) pays homage to Meshes of the Afternoon in his > experimentation with narration. Lynch adopts a similar spiraling narrative > pattern, sets his film within an analogous location and establishes a mood > of dread and paranoia, the result of constant surveillance. Both films focus > on the nightmare as it is expressed in the elusive doubling of characters > and in the incorporation of the ‚Äúpsychogenic fugue,‚Äù the evacuation and > replacement of identities, something that was also central to the voodoo > ritual. Jim Emerson, the editor of RogerEbert.com, has also noted the influence of Meshes within David Lynch's film Inland Empire. Meshes also had a clear influence on Lynch's film Mulholland Drive, with dual roles, a mysterious figure, winding Hollywood road, a dream within a dream, a woman viewing her own body in a dream, and iconic objects such as a key and a telephone. In 2010, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) opened an exhibition that dealt with Deren's influence on three experimental filmmakers, Barbara Hammer, Su Friedrich and Carolee Schneemann, as part of a year-long retrospective there on representation of women. Su Friedrich conceived her short film Cool Hands, Warm Heart (1979) in direct homage to Meshes of the Afternoon, and used the flower and knife motifs similarly in that film. Kristin Hersh's song \\"Your Ghost\\" is inspired by the film, and the song's music video uses several motifs from the film, including a spinning record, a telephone, and a key on a woman's tongue. Likewise, Milla Jovovich's video for \\"Gentleman Who Fell\\" reproduces other motifs such as the mirror-faced figure, the reappearing key, the knife, and the shifting staircase effect. Industrial metal pioneers Godflesh used a still from the film for the cover of their 1994 EP Merciless, as did alternative rock band Primal Scream for their 1986 single \\"Crystal Crescent\\". Experimental electronic artist Sd Laika used samples from the film's soundtrack for the track \\"Meshes\\" on his debut album.\\"Meshes\\". Who Sampled. Retrieved on 2017-06-22. = Jean Cocteau = Meshes of the Afternoon resembles a French film called Blood of a Poet (1930) by Jean Cocteau. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. Meshes of the Afternoon and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances; however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film, and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing Blood of a Poet for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau. In the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had now seen the film multiple times, and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written. = Dali and Bu√±uel = The surrealist background of Dali and Bunuel is a question of influence, because of the surreal nature of Meshes of the Afternoon. Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou (1928) is one of the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious. Deren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. Also, the form of Meshes of the Afternoon does not compare to that of Un Chien Andalou. =Freud and Jung = Psychoanalysis of Meshes of the Afternoon from a Freudian viewer or Jungian viewer attempted to decode the symbolism in the film to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected to her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism; for her, the objects in the film were just that, objects \\"whose value and meaning is defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole\\". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value, and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.

Spike is a vampire and played various roles on the shows, including villain, anti-hero, trickster and romantic interest. For Marsters, the role as Spike began a career in science fiction television, becoming \\"the obvious go-to guy for US cult [television].\\" For creator Whedon, Spike is the \\"most fully developed\\" of his characters. The character was intended to be a brief villain, with Whedon originally adamant to not have another major \\"romantic vampire\\" character like Angel. Marsters says \\"Spike was supposed to be dirty and evil, punk rock, and then dead.\\" However, the character ended up staying for the second season, and then returning in the fourth to replace Cordelia as \\"the character who told Buffy she was stupid and about to die.\\"411mania Interviews: James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), March 10, 2012 Within the series' narrative, William was an unsuccessful aspiring poet in the Victorian era who was mocked and called \\"William the Bloody\\" because of his \\"bloody awful\\" poetry. Sired by the vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau), William became an unusually passionate and romantic vampire, being very violent and ready to battle, but not as cruel as his companions. Alongside Drusilla, Darla (Julie Benz) and Angelus (David Boreanaz), Giles thinks William acquired the nickname Spike for his preferred method of torturing people with railroad spikes, but it is revealed it is because his poetry was \\"so bad you could stick a railroad spike through your head.\\" He was noted for killing two vampire Slayers; one in China at the end of the 1800s during the Boxer Rebellion, the other was Nicki Wood in 1977 New York, where Spike acquired his trademark leather duster. During the second season of the series, Spike comes to Sunnydale hoping to kill a third Slayer, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), with whom he later forges an uneasy alliance. Over the course of Buffy, Spike falls in love with the Slayer, reacquires his soul to prove himself to Buffy and dies a hero in the show's series finale. He is subsequently resurrected in the first episode of the fifth season of the spin-off series Angel. Considered a 'breakout character', Spike proved immensely popular with fans of Buffy.August 3, 2005; Movie File: Jon Heder, Ryan Reynolds, Alyson Hannigan, Mike Judge & More ; MTV Movie News; text refers to Spike as a breakout character. The character appears substantially in Expanded Universe materials such as comic books and tie-in novels. Following the cancellation of Angel in 2004, Whedon considered creating a Spike film spin-off. Canonically, the character appears in issues of the comic books Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight (2007‚Äì11), Angel: After the Fall (2007‚Äì09), Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine, Angel & Faith (both 2011‚Äì2013) and several Spike limited series, spinning off from both Buffy and Angel. Currently the character is in the canonical comic Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven (2016‚Äì2017) and in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve (2018). Appearances =Television= Early history Spike's story before he appears in Sunnydale unfolds in flashbacks scattered, out of sequence, among numerous episodes of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. The first flashback occurs in Buffy Season Five's \\"Fool for Love\\", and reveals William as in fact a meek, effete young man of aristocratic backgroundhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/foolforlove/trivia.shtml (and an aspiring poet) who lived in London with his mother, Anne. Anne would often sing the folksong \\"Early One Morning\\" to her son, right up until the time he was turned into a vampire. William's surname is given as \\"Pratt\\" in the non-canon comic Old Times and is written on the label of his jar of blood in the comic Spike: Asylum #002. This surname became official with the publication of the canon comic Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 11 #7, in which Buffy calls him by it. The name William Pratt may allude to horror actor Boris Karloff, whose birth name was William Henry Pratt, and can also be understood as the British slang term \\"prat\\", describing a person of arrogant stupidity. Spike is one of the youngest recurring vampires on the show, though the evidence of his age is contradictory, as the concept of the character evolved over time. When he was introduced in \\"School Hard\\" (season 2), Giles read that he was \\"barely two hundred,\\" implying that he was either born or sired in 1797 or slightly earlier. In \\"The Initiative\\" (season 4) he said he was 126, thus born or sired in 1874. Flashbacks in \\"Fool for Love\\" (season 5) show that Spike was sired as an adult in 1880. Assuming he was in his early to mid 20s when he was sired, Spike would be in his 140s during the series. In the comic Spike: Asylum #002, Spike's jar of blood has a label giving his assumed human birth date in 1853, about 27 years before he was sired. William, before becoming a vampire In 1880, William was a struggling poet, often mocked by his peers who called him \\"William the Bloody\\" behind his back because his poetry was so \\"bloody awful.\\" The true origins of this nickname were not revealed until three years after it was first mentioned in Season Two, when it was believed to have purely violent connotations. William showed a strong capacity for loyalty and devoted love, which remained after his siring. After his romantic overtures were rejected by the aristocratic Cecily, William wandered the streets despondently and bumped into Drusilla. She consoled him, drained him of blood and made him drink of her blood, thus transforming him into a vampire ‚Äì \\"siring\\" him, in the jargon of the series. Spike's grand-sire Angelus became his mentor (leading Spike occasionally to describe him loosely as his sire): \\"Drusilla sired me, but you, you made me a monster.\\" Whereas new vampires in the Buffyverse often delight in killing their families once they become evil, William was a notable exception. Having always been very close to his mother, he turned her into a vampire to save her from tuberculosis. But his mother, as a vampire, taunted William and insinuated he had always had a sexual fascination with her. William chose to stake her because he found he could not bear to see his mother behaving like the soulless vampire he had made of her. She, like most vampires, lacked his unusual capacity for some of the softer human emotions, like love and compassion. After staking his mother, William began a new life with Drusilla, to whom he was utterly devoted. Euphoric with his newfound vampiric abilities, he adopted the poses and trappings of a cultural rebel, affecting a working class East London accent and embracing impulsiveness and extreme violence. He adopted the nom de guerre \\"Spike\\" based on his habit of torturing people with railroad spikes ‚Äì possibly prompted by criticism of his poetry: \\"I'd rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff.\\" In \\"The Weight of the World\\" Spike mentions having spent \\"the better part of a century\\" in delinquency, suggesting criminal activities other than killing for blood. In the company of Drusilla, Angelus and Darla, Spike terrorized Europe and Asia for almost two decades. He had a strained relationship with Drusilla's sire Angelus, who continued a sexual relationship with her despite Spike's strong disapproval. Although Angelus did enjoy the company of another male vampire in their travels, he found Spike's recklessness and lust for battle to be unnecessary risks. Angelus regarded killing as an art, not a sport, and killed for the sheer act of evil; Spike did it for amusement and the rush. In 1894, Spike and Angelus developed a rivalry with the enigmatic Immortal, who later had Spike sent to prison for tax evasion. In 1900, Spike killed Xin_Rong, a Chinese Slayer while in China during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1943, he was captured by Nazis for experimentation and taken aboard a submarine, where he was briefly reunited with Angel. By the 1950s, Spike had reunited with Drusilla, and they traveled to Italy. At some point, Spike also became rivals with the famous vampire Dracula. The enmity between Spike and Dracula was explored in the comic series Spike vs. Dracula, in which their mutual hatred is caused when Spike, along with Darla and Drusilla, slaughtered the Romani (gypsy) tribe who had cursed their patriarch, Angelus, with a soul, although it is unclear if either Spike or Drusilla knew precisely why Darla was so angry with the tribe. That clan (unknown to Spike) was favored by Dracula and he sought revenge for their deaths. Spike later mentions in a conversation with Riley Finn, \\"Dracula? Poncy bugger owes me ¬£11, for one thing,\\" because Dracula tossed Spike's signed copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula in a fire in 1898. Spike also notes that Dracula's fame has done more damage to vampires than any Slayer, since it made their weaknesses more widely known. Spike attended Woodstock in 1969, whereupon he accidentally became high after ingesting the blood of a hippie, he claims to have spent the next six hours following the incident \\"watching my hand move\\". In 1977 he fought and killed a second Slayer, Nikki Wood, aboard a subway train in New York City, taking from her a black leather duster which he wears throughout his appearances on Buffy and Angel until it is destroyed in an explosion in Season Five of Angel, whereupon he gets a new one that looks exactly like the old one (\\"The Girl in Question\\"). At some point post-1977, Billy Idol allegedly \\"stole\\" Spike's look and made it famous as his own (as revealed in Season Seven's \\"Sleeper\\"; see \\"Appearance\\" below); Spike's thoughts on this are unrecorded. Inasmuch as Buffy knew of the \\"theft\\" as of \\"Sleeper,\\" Spike presumably shared the detail with her in an undepicted moment. Spike's flashback appearances, in chronological order, include: *Lies My Parents Told Me 2nd flashback: In 1880 England, William, pre-Spike, tends to his ailing mother Anne. *Fool for Love 1st flashback / Darla 3rd flashback: In 1880, William is rejected by Cecily and sired by Drusilla, with whom he immediately falls in love. *Lies My Parents Told Me 3rd and 4th flashbacks: In 1880, William sires his mother Anne, who, as a vampire, turns against him, forcing him to destroy her. *Destiny series of flashbacks: In 1880, Drusilla introduces William to her sire Angelus. Although the two become fast friends, they later clash when William discovers Angelus making love with Drusilla. Angelus, informing William that when one is a vampire \\"you can take what you want, have what you want, but nothing is yours,\\" fights William for the first time. * \\"Fool for Love\\" 2nd flashback: Months after being sired, William, now called Spike, has through acts of public mayhem forced Angelus' vampire group (himself, Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus' sire/paramour Darla) to flee London; Spike first learns of the existence of the Vampire Slayer. *The Girl in Question 1st flashback: In 1894, Spike and Angelus are imprisoned by the mysterious Immortal, who seduces Drusilla and Darla in their absence. *Darla 4th flashback: In 1898 Romania, Spike and Drusilla, under Darla's orders, attack the Kalderash tribe who ensouled Angelus, later called Angel. Following this incident, Angel parts company with the group, and the other three vampires resume their travels without him. * \\"Fool for Love\\" 3rd flashback / Darla 5th flashback: In 1900 China, Spike kills the Chinese Vampire Slayer. Angel, still ensouled, briefly reunites with the group; when Spike and Drusilla, neither of whom seem aware that Angel is ensouled, boast of Spike's deed, Angel pretends to be impressed but is actually disgusted. Darla ultimately rejects Angel because he can no longer bring himself to kill innocents, and Angel again leaves the group. Precisely what Spike and Drusilla make of these developments between their \\"elders\\" is unrevealed. At some point over the next few decades, Spike and Drusilla part company with Darla, and Spike's reputation for bloodshed and chaos eventually rivals even that of Angelus. *Why We Fight series of flashbacks: In 1943, Spike, temporarily adventuring without Drusilla, and two other vampires are abducted by Nazi agents onto a Nazi sub. Angel, working for the US government, helps Spike seize control of the sub, and the two escape and then part ways. As far as is known, this is Spike and Angel's last meeting prior to the events of School Hard in 1998. *The Girl in Question 2nd flashback: Spike and Drusilla visit Italy. *Lies My Parents Told Me 1st flashback: In 1977 New York, Spike fights Vampire Slayer Nikki Wood while her young son Robin watches from a hiding place. * \\"Fool for Love\\" 4th flashback: In 1977 New York, Spike again fights Nikki Wood, killing her. These are Spike's last depicted activities preceding his arrival in Sunnydale, California. Sunnydale Spike first arrives in Sunnydale in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in the episode \\"School Hard\\", accompanied by Drusilla. Spike and Dru were modeled on Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen; punk, \\"badass\\" vampires to contrast sharply with the more ceremonial tradition of the Master and the Order of Aurelius from Season One.\\"A Buffy Bestiary\\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 2 DVD featurette Spike is in fact a fan of Sid Vicious' band The Sex Pistols and punk band The Ramones. In the final scene of the episode \\"Lovers Walk\\", he can be seen singing to a cover of \\"My Way\\" by Gary Oldman, who portrayed Vicious in the film Sid and Nancy. Spike's first act in Sunnydale is to attack Buffy and a large group of people at her school, making his first appearance the deadliest of any of Buffys \\"Big Bads\\", as he very nearly kills Buffy, but Buffy's mother distracts Spike long enough for Buffy to recover. Throughout Season Two, Spike and Dru are the canon's most prominent example of affection between vampires, displaying the humanity and intricacies of vampire relationships. Spike was initially conceived as a disposable villain to be killed off, but proved so popular with fans that Joss Whedon decided to merely injure him instead, in the episode \\"What's My Line, Part Two\\", in which Spike is crushed by a collapsing pipe organ and left paralyzed. (Later it is revealed that he has healed but chosen to stay in the wheelchair to deceive Angel whom he intended to betray.) Spike's first appearance in the episode \\"School Hard\\" (1997). Spike and Drusilla are major enemies of Buffy for much of the second season. They arrive shortly after Drusilla is seriously weakened by an angry mob in Prague, as recounted in the canon comic book The Problem with Vampires. Spike is a devoted caretaker to Drusilla in her weakened condition, and initially hopes the Hellmouth's energy can help restore her strength. He reunites with Angel and seems genuinely pleased to see him, but is disgusted to find that Angel has a soul (whether or not Spike in fact knew that Angel's acquisition of a soul is why he left the group nearly a century before has never been made clear) and is in love with the current Slayer, Buffy Summers. When Angel loses his soul and rejoins Spike and Dru, Spike's initial celebration soon turns to resentment when Angelus starts pursuing Drusilla as a lover and taunting him. Spike decides to ally himself with Buffy against Angelus; as he explains to Buffy, in addition to wanting Drusilla back, he also wants to \\"save the world\\": Spike reappears in the Season Three episode \\"Lovers Walk\\", in a drunken depression after Drusilla, offended by his alliance with Buffy, dumps him for a Chaos demon. He kidnaps Willow and Xander, and forces Willow to conduct a love spell for him to make Drusilla love him again, even coercing Buffy and Angel to help him in exchange for the safe return of their friends. The excitement of a brawl with the Mayor's vampires helps him see that Drusilla left him because he had begun to go soft; he resolves to win her back by torturing her until she likes him again, and tells Buffy where to find Willow and Xander. He also tells Buffy and Angel that they can never be 'just friends' because of their love for one another. This insight foreshadows Spike's later role as the \\"truth-seer\\" of the group. Spike returns to Sunnydale alone in Season Four, in the episode \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\", briefly living with Harmony Kendall, a shallow former classmate of Buffy, now a vampire. He is in Sunnydale to look for the Gem of Amarra, a ring which makes a vampire effectively invulnerable. He finds it and attacks Buffy in daylight, but she wrests the ring from his finger and sends it to Angel. Spike goes to Los Angeles, and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel in order to get the ring, but Marcus takes the ring himself and Angel finally destroys it. After being captured by The Initiative and implanted with a cerebral microchip which punishes him with debilitating pain whenever he harms or attempts to harm any non-demon life forms (he initially assumes it works the same with anything living), Spike turns to the Scooby Gang for protection, bartering his knowledge of the Initiative. (Though he still spars with Buffy, provided he has no real intent on harming her) His inability to bite is comically compared to impotence, much to Spike's constant humiliation; in \\"Doomed\\", he attempts to commit suicide by staking himself at Xander's house, but is stopped by Willow and Xander. Eventually, he inadvertently discovers that he can harm demons and enthusiastically joins a fight with this knowledge, showing that he's less concerned about what side he's fighting on than fighting for the thrill of it. Occasionally helping the Scooby Gang by providing them with information and/or combat assistance in exchange for cash or for the joy of fighting, but having no qualms about betraying them to such enemies as Faith and Adam. In Season Four, Spike was introduced to fill the antagonistic role that Cordelia had in seasons One to Three; as Joss Whedon explains on the DVD featurette, \\"All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?\\"\\"Introducing Spike\\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 4 DVD featurette Spike appeared in every episode thereafter with the exception of \\"The Body\\". In Season Five, after some erotic dreams, Spike becomes aware to his horror that he has fallen in love with Buffy. He becomes a more active participant in the Scooby Gang, jumping into several of Buffy's fights to provide assistance, whether she wants it or not. When Buffy rejects his advances, Spike attempts to prove his love by kidnapping her so that she can witness him killing Drusilla for her, to little avail; in her disgust, Buffy un-invites him from her house (something she had not bothered to do in almost three years since their alliance against Angelus) and alienates him from the group. Spike then has Warren Mears make a robot in Buffy's likeness, programmed to love and obey him. Though Buffy is disgusted by this, her hostility towards him fades considerably when she learns that Spike refused, even under intense torture, to reveal the identity of The Key to Glory, nearly laying down his life to protect Buffy's sister Dawn. Buffy is moved by this unexpected loyalty and kisses him, saying she will not forget what he has done. In the days and hours leading up to the final showdown with Glory, Spike fights by Buffy's side, earning her trust and a re-invitation to her house. Spike displays unabashed grief after Buffy dies in the showdown with Glory, Spike honors her memory by remaining loyal to the Scoobies, fighting at their side and serving the role of baby-sitter / older brother / protector to Dawn, helping Willow and Tara to raise her in Buffy's absence. After Buffy is resurrected at the beginning of Season Six, she is despondent and detached from her friends. During this time, her relationship to Spike deepens and she is able to talk to him about things she feels she cannot share with the Scooby Gang. She gets drunk with Spike, and calls him \\"a neutered vampire who cheats at kitten poker.\\" After a demon's spell makes them express their emotions in song, and Buffy sings \\"I want the fire back\\", Buffy and Spike begin a physical relationship, consummated two episodes later. The relationship is frequently violent, with Buffy most often initiating both the violence and the sex between them; the violence is made all the easier when Spike finds that (as a side effect of Willow's resurrection spell) his chip now does not stop him from harming Buffy. Buffy threatens to kill Spike if he ever tells anyone about their relationship. Both are unsatisfied; Buffy is ashamed of her dark desires, while Spike obsessively craves the love, trust, and affection that she is unwilling to give. In \\"As You Were\\", Buffy tells Spike she is using him and ends their relationship. Believing he still has a chance with Buffy after seeing her reactions of jealousy and hurt when he has a drunk sexual encounter with Anya, Spike corners her and makes aggressive sexual advances. When she refuses him, he grows desperate and unsuccessfully tries to rape her. He is at once horrified by his own actions and intentions, while also somewhat remiss that he did not go through with the rape, since he is still essentially a demon and has had no problem committing such acts in the past. This is seen in his reactions to reliving the memory of the event while discussing his subsequent mood with Clem, who has come by with hot wings to hang out. Spike heads to a remote area of Africa, where he seeks out a legendary demon shaman and undergoes the Demon Trials, a series of grueling physical challenges. Proving his worthiness by surviving the trials, Spike earns his soul back. In Season Seven, a re- ensouled Spike must cope with the guilt of his past actions and try to win back Buffy's trust. But under influence of the First Evil's hypnotic trigger, Spike unknowingly starts killing again. Upon discovering what he has done, he begs Buffy to stake him, but she refuses and takes him into her house, telling him she has seen him change. Buffy guards and cares for Spike throughout his recovery, telling Spike she believes in him, a statement which later sustains him throughout his imprisonment and torture at the hands of the First. When Spike's chip begins to malfunction, causing him intense pain and threatening to kill him, Buffy trusts him enough to order the Initiative operatives to remove it from his head. When Nikki Wood's son Robin tries to kill Spike, he unwittingly frees Spike from his hypnotic trigger: the song \\"Early One Morning\\", a favorite of his mother, which evokes Spike's traumatic memories of his mother's abusive behavior toward him after she turned; after Spike is able to address these issues, he realizes his mother had always loved him, knowledge which frees him from the First's control. Later in the season, Spike and Buffy achieve an emotional closeness; he alone stays loyal to her when the Scoobies and Potentials mutiny against her, and his words and encouragement give a depressed Buffy the strength to continue fighting. They spend three nights together, one of which Spike describes as the best night of his life, just holding her. It is unclear whether they resume their sexual intimacy during the third night; creator Joss Whedon says on the DVD commentary for \\"Chosen\\" that he intentionally left it to the viewers to decide how they felt the relationship progressed, though Whedon had earlier stated on the commentary he personally felt having them resume a sexual relationship would send the wrong message. In the final battle inside the Hellmouth, Spike, wearing a mystical amulet, sacrifices himself to destroy the Turok-Han and close the Hellmouth. He is slowly incinerated in the process, but not before Buffy tells him \\"I love you.\\" He replies, \\"No, you don't; but thanks for saying it.\\" Even as he burns and crumbles to dust, Spike laughs and revels in the destruction around him and the burning presence of his soul, glad to be able to see the fight to its end. In dying to save the world, he becomes a Champion. Los Angeles Spike had previously appeared in the season 1 episode of Angel \\"In the Dark\\", Spike goes to Los Angeles at the same time as Oz arrives to give Angel the Gem of Amarra, Spike's objective was to get the ring and kill Angel. Oz gives Angel the ring who then hides it in the sewer, just as he is about to leave for another case he is ambushed by Spike who hits him with a wooden plank, Angel defeats Spike but Spike warns him that he will get the ring one way or another. Angel takes precaution and goes on a manhunt for Spike, Angel finally finds him, chases him through the alley, and corners him only to fall into Spike's trap. Spike captures Angel and hires a vampire named Marcus to torture Angel until he tells him where the ring is. After a while Spike gets bored with waiting so he goes to Angel's apartment to find the ring and leaving Marcus to torture Angel, he gets to the apartment only to find Cordelia and Doyle aiming at him with weapons and demanding to know where Angel is. Spike reveals Angel's location and tells them that the only way he will release Angel is if they find him the ring. Cordelia and Doyle find the ring in the sewer and head straight to Spike. When they arrive at the location they find out that Spike had lied about releasing Angel. Taking precautions however, they then throw the ring away and just as Spike was about to retrieve it, Oz bursts through the wall in his van and rescues Angel. Spike looks for the ring but finds out that Marcus took it. Spike begins smashing Marcus's things and shouting about how he is going to work alone from now on until a hole that was in the ceiling lets sunlight in and sets the back of his hair on fire. Despite his apparent death at the end of Buffy final season, Spike returns in the fifth and final season of the spin-off series Angel. Resurrected by the amulet in the Los Angeles branch of supernatural law firm Wolfram & Hart, he spends seven episodes as an incorporeal being akin to a ghost; he starts to understand being one when he battles \\"the Reaper\\" Matthias Pavayne. During this time he realizes he is being slowly pulled into hell. Later he becomes corporeal, due to a mysterious gift that arrives at the office of Wolfram and Hart. After this, Spike takes on Angel to prove which one of them is the Champion spoken of in the Shanshu Prophecy. Spike defeats Angel, but the prophecy remains ambiguous (the Cup of Torment is revealed as a fake containing Mountain Dew). Manipulated by Lindsey McDonald into \\"helping the helpless\\", Spike becomes a sort of rival to Angel; resembling the heroic Champion Angel was in earlier seasons before becoming disillusioned and corrupted by the bureaucracy of Wolfram & Hart. Soon afterward he is kidnapped by the psychotic Slayer Dana, who believes he was responsible for kidnapping and torturing her as a child. Cordelia comments on this strange turn of events after coming out of her coma in \\"You're Welcome\\", exclaiming to Angel, \\"Okay, Spike's a hero, and you're CEO of Hell, Incorporated. What freaking bizarro world did I wake up in?\\" When Fred is killed by Illyria, Spike mourns her death and decides to join Team Angel in her honor. Upon learning that Buffy is now dating The Immortal, Spike and Angel travel to Rome on the pretext of business but spend most of the time there trying to find Buffy. In the end, they fail to catch up with her. (The blonde glimpsed in Rome is later revealed to be a decoy Buffy, set up by Andrew Wells, who had researched the history between Angel, Spike and The Immortal, and thought the idea would be \\"hilarious\\".) During the final episodes of Angel, Spike is the first to vote for Angel's plan to wound the Senior Partners by massacring the Circle of the Black Thorn. He then spends what might be his last hours on Earth returning to his mortal roots as a frustrated poet, triumphantly knocking them dead (figuratively) in an open mic poetry slam at a bar. After single-handedly (literally, he held the baby in one hand and a sword in the other) rescuing an infant and destroying the Fell Brethren, Spike joins Angel, Illyria, and a badly wounded Charles Gunn in the alley behind the Hyperion as the series draws to an end, preparing to incur the apocalyptic wrath of the Senior Partners, as a way of going out in a blaze of glory that will probably cost their lives. =Literature= Spike appears significantly in a number of canonical Expanded Universe literature concurrent with and subsequent to the television series, including both Buffy and Angel comic books. Many of these novels and comic books concern Spike's backstory in the periods between the events shown in flashbacks in the television series. From 2007, both Dark Horse Comics and IDW Publishing began telling canonical continuations of Buffy and Angel, respectively. Marsters himself wrote for the miniseries Spike & Dru in 2000. The collection also featured the Christopher Golden stories \\"The Queen of Hearts\\", \\"All's Fair\\", \\"Paint the Town Red\\" and \\"Who Made Who?\\", set in or around episodes of Buffy in Seasons Two and Four; \\"Who Made Who\\" is set during the Buffy episode \\"Lovers Walk\\" and depicts the disintegration of his relationship with Drusilla when they were together in Brazil. After Buffy finished in 2003, Spike appeared in a comic story from the canonical Tales of the Vampires series. Written by series writer Drew Goddard, \\"The Problem with Vampires\\" establishes his adventures in Prague prior to his introduction Buffy episode \\"School Hard\\". Christopher Golden's 2000 novel Spike and Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row depicts Spike killing a Slayer named Sophie in the 1940s, contradicting the two Slayers whom Spike is later established to have killed; the second Slayer Spike killed was established as New Yorker Nikki Wood. The short story \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" from the collection Tales of the Slayer is a sequel to this novel. Golden's 2006 novel, Blackout, is truer to the series' chronology by depicting Spike's fatal encounter with Slayer Nikki Wood in 1977. Diana G. Gallagher's 2005 novel Spark and Burn depicts the struggling early-Season Seven Spike remembering an account of his life, amounting to a chronological character history of Spike's life from the 19th century to the time of the framing device. This promotional poster for Brian Lynch's IDW Spike series was drawn by artist Franco Urru in response to the spoiler leak controversy for the Dark Horse Comics series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight. The image is reflective of Spike's role in both franchises. Note that as the series' central character, Spike receives his own stylised logo. Most Spike-centric stories, however, have been published subsequent to Angels finale episode. The 2005 IDW comic book Spike: Old Times, by Peter David, depicts Spike's encounter with the vengeance demon Halfrek, explaining his recognition of her in Buffy episode \\"Older and Far Away\\", and clarifying that she was in fact his beloved Cecily. Mutant Enemy approved the story, even though IDW did not have rights to a Buffy-only character like Halfrek, because of her importance to Spike's backstory, on the condition that the story's timing was deliberately ambiguous. Following Angels cancellation, Spike immediately appeared in the Angel miniseries Spike vs. Dracula by Peter David, a sequel to the Buffy episode \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\" and expanding on the characters' century-old rivalry established in that episode. Scott Tipton's 2006 comic Spike: Old Wounds is detective fiction set during Season Five, and also features allusions to Spike's activities in the late 1940s. Tipton's Spike: Lost and Found in 2006 is a Season Five story that acts as a sequel to the 1999 Buffy/Angel crossover episodes \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\" and \\"In the Dark\\", featuring the immortality-bestowing Gem of Amarra in 2005 Los Angeles. Lastly, writer Brian Lynch teamed up with Franco Urru to produce the story arc Spike: Asylum (2006‚Äì07), depicting Spike's stay in a supernatural medical facility. Although originally of the same ambiguous relationship to canon, the characters it introduced would reappear in the canonical Angel comic books to come later. Whedon appreciated Lynch's writing of Spike in Asylum so much that he commissioned him to co-write the canonical continuation of the series, Angel: After the Fall, in 2007. Lynch and Urru also penned Spike: Shadow Puppets, featuring Spike and Lorne doing battle with the muppet demons of Angel episode \\"Smile Time\\" in Japan. In the explicitly canonical Whedon stories of 2007, Spike and Angel first appear in a joint cameo in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight (Dark Horse) as part of Buffy's sexual fantasies.Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #3, \\"The Long Way Home, Part Three\\"DiLullo, Tara, \\"Pieces of Eight\\", from The Official Buffy & Angel Magazine #93 (UK, April/May 2007), page 23-24. In the Dark Horse Presents #24 Season Eight tie-in, \\"Always Darkest\\", Spike and Angel appear (again in a dream sequence) at Buffy's side when she is fighting Caleb, but to her dismay the two start flirting with and kissing one another. Spike appears in Season Eight properly at the conclusion of the \\"Twilight\\" story arc. Lynch's Spike series features some collaboration with Whedon to connect the IDW and Dark Horse series' continuities. IDW had planned to launch the series as a bona fide ongoing series, and as such it establishes a support cast for Spike suited to his position headlining the title. The transfer of Angel rights from IDW to Dark Horse necessitated that it end instead as an 8-issue miniseries. In IDW's Angel: After the Fall, Spike does not appear until the second issue, written by Brian Lynch with art by Franco Urru (the creative team of Spike: Asylum and Spike: Shadow Puppets) with plotting and \\"executive production\\" by Whedon himself. In Angel: After the Fall, Spike has adjusted to Los Angeles' new status as a literal hell on Earth; he and Illyria both serve together as the Demon Lords of Beverly Hills, living in the Playboy Mansion after the death of Hugh Hefner and served by a harem of human and demon females known collectively as the \\"Spikettes.\\" How Spike and Illyria got to be Lords of Los Angeles is detailed in the Spike: After the Fall (2008) miniseries, which also introduces a human friend for Spike in Jeremy Johns. In their new capacity, Spike and Illyria secretly rescue humans and benevolent demons, evacuating them into the care of Connor, Nina Ash, and Gwen Raiden. Spike rallies alongside Angel against the other demon Lords. When vampire Gunn causes Illyria to revert to her monster form, memories of Fred from Spike and Wesley are transplanted into her to restore her humanity. After the Senior Partners revert time to before the Fall, Spike begins a loosely affiliated relationship with the reformed Angel Investigations company, collaborating with Angel and his associates while maintaining independence. Spike continues to appear in the ongoing Angel spin-off series by IDW, under the pens of Kelley Armstrong, Bill Willingham and others. As part of its After the Fall franchise, IDW also published Bill Williams' miniseries, Spike: The Devil You Know (2010), which follows Spike's journey from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where he acquires a spaceship and a crew of alien bugs after learning from Wolfram & Hart of a prophecy concerning the impending apocalypse (featured in Buffy) which has driven them to abandon this dimension. Spike's IDW series feeds into the \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Last Gleaming\\" arcs of Buffy Season Eight, concluding that series in 2011. In Season Eight, Spike and his crew come to Buffy's aid to help prevent the end of the universe. Due to his own research into the prophecies concerning this apocalypse, Spike is able to lead Buffy and friends to the site of the final showdown with Twilight. When Buffy's decision sees the world lose its magic, Spike is the only one to be emphatically supportive of the decision she had to make. In the follow-up series Season Nine (2011-2013), Spike bases his ship in San Francisco to be near Buffy, but eventually leaves due to the complicatedness of their relationship, setting up the miniseries Spike: A Dark Place (2012), which follows Spike and his insectoid crew aboard his spaceship. Dark Horse also gives the Spike title a new stylised logo, distinct from the Angel-typeface logo used prior. The arc serves to divest Spike of the ship and crew, and sets up his 2013 crossover stint in Angel & Faith ahead of an eventual return to the main Buffy series. In issues of Angel & Faith, Spike helps Angel defeat a demon in possession of Giles' soul, but leaves London where they are based without hesitation when he learns that Dawn is gravely unwell back in San Francisco. He returns to San Francisco to provide comfort to Dawn who is rapidly fading away without magic in the world to sustain her form. However, his memories of her start to quickly fade and recordings he makes of himself talking about her turn to static. Spike appears unconcerned he missed the chance to talk to Buffy who, along with Willow and Xander, has gone to find magic to save Dawn at the Deeper Well in England. When nobody can remember the name of Buffy's sister, he phones her boyfriend Xander, and also warns him that the rogue Slayer Simone Doffler has been seeking a way to become the ultimate vampire. When the others return and Dawn is restored Buffy thanks him for staying with her sister, Spike says all that matters to him is that Dawn is safe again. Spike continues to appear in Season Ten, in which he and Buffy finally resume their relationship, tell each other they love each other and kiss. Characterization =Personality= Spike is seen as something of a paradox amongst vampires in the series, and frequently challenges vampire conventions and limitations. As a soulless vampire, he exhibits quite a few human traits such as love, loyalty, and aesthetic appreciation. As an ensouled vampire, Spike's need for violence remains unapologetically intact. Spike's actions are motivated by love in all of its incarnations (love of objects, love of life, love of a specific person). Drusilla does, however, make it seem that all vampires are capable of exhibiting human emotions (such as love) when she says to Buffy, \\"We can love quite well. Though not always wisely.\\" Throughout the Buffy series, Spike's character changes and develops the most out of them all. He begins as \\"evil\\" and obsessed with Drusilla, then becomes a depressed drunk after Drusilla leaves him for a Chaos demon because he is not \\"demon enough\\" for her anymore. He then heard about the \\"Gem of Amara,\\" a gemstone that is rumored to give vampires the ability to walk in the sun; it was called a kind of holy grail for the vampires because it was only assumed to be real. Spike set his sights on finding it and ended up locating it in Sunnydale. It was taken away from him by an angry Buffy who subsequently gave it to Angel in Los Angeles. Spike was then captured by The Initiative and was going to be used as a government science experiment. His next character development and change was after he escaped the Initiative, realized he could not harm any human being because of the chip they put in his brain, and saw his only option as going to Buffy and the Scooby Gang for help. Their relationship then grew slowly from a hostile tolerance to a confusing romantic relationship to a mutual respect and understanding. Spike had setbacks along the way; there were times when he reverted to his former \\"evil\\" self and tried to hurt Buffy or the Scoobies. But there were also times when he showed astounding amounts of human emotion and responsibility for a supposedly \\"evil,\\" soulless creature. Spike is also rare among vampires because he does not fear Slayers; he seeks them out and has killed two by the time he arrives in Sunnydale. He is proud of this accomplishment despite the fact that his victories had more to do with the Slayers' state of mind than a special prowess on his part (or \\"luck,\\" as he reveals in Buffy episode Fool for Love). Spike admits this to an inquiring Buffy in the season 5 episode Fool for Love, and the impact of his revelation has probably not been completely felt as of the completion of season 7. Spike is intelligent, insightful and a skilled analyst. His sense of humor is dry and sarcastic, and he carries himself with swagger. However, in the episode ‚ÄòBecoming: Part 2‚Äô he reveals himself to be a fan of Manchester United Football Club. Spike has a habit of pithy remarks and glib insults, even toward the few he does not view as antagonists. Among his favorite targets are Angel, Xander, Giles, and (to a lesser extent) Buffy - in Season 5's episode The Gift as he and Giles are leaving to fight Glory, he wryly paraphrases Giles' quotation of Shakespeare's Henry V 'we band of brothers' speech to 'we band of buggered'. Joss Whedon credits this antipathy as what convinced him in the episode \\"Lovers Walk\\" to bring Spike back as a cast regular. As James Marsters put it, \\"I was supposed to be the one who stood at the side and said, 'Buffy, you're stupid, and we're all gonna die'.\\" Spike often nicknames people, both as insults and as terms of endearment; for example, he calls Dawn \\"Little Bit\\" or \\"the Niblet\\". Spike also retains something of his literary intellect from his human side, routinely referencing poetry, songs, and literature; on occasion he even waxes poetic on the nature of love, life, and unlife as being driven by blood, reasoning that blood is more powerful than any supernatural force because it is what separates the living from the dead. Spike often treats his vulnerability to the sun as simply an annoying inconvenience. He drives in broad daylight in vehicles with blacked-out windows, and on several occasions travels outside during the day using a blanket for cover. Indeed, he has a remarkably stronger resistance to sunlight than most all other vampires seen in the series except Angel; their elevated ability to endure the sun should not be confused with total immunity, however. =Appearance= The character's look has been compared with rock musician Billy Idol (pictured) Spike has a punk look which strongly resembles English rock musician Billy Idol; humorously, Buffy claims that Billy Idol in fact stole his look from Spike. His hair is peroxide blond for the duration of his time on Buffy and Angel, although in flashbacks it can be seen in its natural medium brown state as well as dyed black. His nails are often painted black. A Y-shaped scar on Marsters's left eyebrow, received during a mugging, was worked into the show; make-up artist Todd McIntosh decided to shave out his eyebrow in order to make it more prominent. He also included the scar on Spike's \\"vamp face\\" prosthesis, albeit slightly altered as though the skin has stretched.\\"Beauty and the Beasts\\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 2 DVD featurette In Spike's first appearances the wound still looks fresh, but it gradually fades until, in Angel season 5, it is barely visible. A flashback in \\"Fool for Love\\" reveals that Spike received the scar from the sword of the first Slayer he killed in 1900. Spike usually wears long black leather coats, including one that he took from a Nazi officer and another that he took as a trophy from Nikki Wood, the second Slayer he killed. He wore the Slayer's black duster for over twenty-five years. When the coat was destroyed by a bomb from the Immortal in Italy, Spike heartbrokenly declared it to be irreplaceable; but the Italian branch of Wolfram & Hart quickly supplied him with a whole wardrobe of new ones, nearly identical, which he happily began wearing. His trademark look includes the leather duster, a black T-shirt or v-neck shirt and black denim pants, usually with heavy boots or Doc Martens. He also wore a red long-sleeved shirt fairly often, particularly during the earlier seasons of Buffy, and a bright blue shirt early in Season 6 & 7\\\\. He explained that the shirt was supposed to show Buffy that he had changed and give him confidence (because the First was messing with his head and he did not want Buffy to think he was still evil or crazy). But later, he returned to his trademark look, commenting that he was back. Powers and abilities In addition to possessing the common powers and weaknesses of vampires, Spike's age and experience makes him a highly effective, skilled, and versatile fighter in both armed and unarmed combat. For example, he is able to briefly overcome Illyria during a testing of her abilities prior to her powers being greatly reduced by Wesley. Illyria criticizes his (and others') ability to adapt, calling it \\"compromise.\\" He is able to withstand excessive amounts of pain for extended periods of time, particularly when properly motivated, as seen in the episodes \\"Intervention\\" and \\"Showtime\\". While not as skilled or as sadistic as Angelus, Spike also proves himself to be effective at torture, noting he had gained \\"screams, various fluids, and a name\\" from Doctor Sparrow. Much like Angel, he is highly proficient in various forms of martial arts, and his typical fighting style blends karate, kung fu, and others. Spike often displays insight and skills in perception and observation, especially with regard to relationships and personalities, so long as the relationship in question does not concern him personally. This ability allows him to wield powerful psychological weapons as easily and effectively as physical ones. For example, when he wants to create disharmony among the Scoobies, Spike divides- and-conquers with \\"The Yoko Factor\\", exploiting tensions that exist under the surface to alienate Buffy and her friends against each other. Spike's skills of analysis allowed him to realize Willow was barely holding it together after Oz's departure even though Giles and Buffy thought she was doing better, to be the first to see through Tara's abusive and controlling family, forced Buffy and Angel to admit that they were more than \\"just friends\\" and identify when and why some relationships, such as between Buffy and Riley, are not meant to last, masterfully feeding Riley's insecurities in an effort to sabotage his relationship with Buffy, so Spike can pursue her. He also predicted that Willow would go fighting against Glory after what she did to Tara even though Buffy believed that she had talked Willow out of the suicidal attempt because he would do so if Glory hurt the people he loved. His analytical skills and intuitive insight also help him in battle from time to time, helping him to defeat, or hold his own against, very formidable adversaries. For example, he explains to Buffy he was able to defeat two Slayers because he sensed and exploited their secret desires to be free of their burden. In \\"Time Bomb\\", he identifies Illyria's fighting style as a Tae Kwon Do/Brazilian Capoeira / Ninjitsu hybrid. While many vampires cling to the mannerisms and speech patterns prevalent at the time they were sired, Spike has been shown to easily adjust to changing fashions and styles over the decades and displays an impressive knowledge of both British and American popular culture, demonstrating another aspect of his potential for analysis and adaptability. Although capable of developing sound battle strategies, Spike (particularly in the days before receiving his chip and being re-ensouled) often loses patience with anything more complicated than outright attack, as mentioned in the episode \\"In the Dark\\". He is also impatient to fight the Slayer upon his initial arrival in Sunnydale; the attack is supposed to coincide with the Night of St. Vigeous (when a vampire's natural abilities are enhanced), but he \\"couldn't wait\\" to go after the Slayer and recklessly leads a mass assault against Buffy at Sunnydale High, which fails and results in the deaths of many Aurelian vampires. However, Spike did exercise patience throughout the later half of Buffy Season Two, when he used a wheelchair for several months after a brutal battle with the Scoobies in the episode What's My Line left him paraplegic. Feigning weakness, he endured torturous weeks watching Angelus sexually pursue Dru as he waited for the right time to strike against his enemy. Spike's \\"vampire constitution\\" provides him with an extremely high tolerance for alcohol (which he regularly consumes in copious quantities). His experience in crime gives him skill at picking locks, hotwiring cars and picking pockets. He is also capable of easily operating various vehicles, such as various cars, a Honda CB400T motorcycle (\\"Bargaining part 2\\"), and a Winnebago (\\"Spiral\\"). He has also been shown using video game systems and a computer, treating injuries, and playing poker and pool. Spike is also seen speaking/understanding Latin, Luganda (a language of Uganda, where he meets the demon shaman), and the language of Fyarl demons, two of whom he once employed as muscle during his pre-Sunnydale days. He is also shown to be capable of recognizing literature; in the last episode of season five, he paraphrases a line from the St. Crispin's Day Speech while in conversation with Giles after Buffy tells them her plan of attack on Glory. When Spike was transformed into a ghost-like intangible state following the destruction of Sunnydale and the Hellmouth and his subsequent materialization at Wolfram & Hart, he was capable of walking through solid objects. He was initially unable to make contact with objects around him until he learned how to focus his abilities through desire, allowing him to make brief contact with people and things if he concentrated enough. This ability was relatively useless in a fight; he was unable to pick up a wooden bar to hit the demon Tezcatcatl in \\"The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco\\", and required a few moments to properly punch a cyborg strangling Gunn in \\"Lineage\\". Naturally, he lost these capabilities when he was recorporealized by Lindsey. Unproduced spin-off movie In 2004, Joss Whedon set plans for a Spike movie. The film, if ever greenlit, would star James Marsters, Alyson Hannigan and Amy Acker. At a 2006 convention, Acker stated the film was not going ahead due to money issues. Reception Spike was placed first in SFX magazine's \\"Top 50 Vampires\\" on television and movies list. The same list featured rival Angel in the third place. Spike was described as an \\"antihero in the true sense of the word, Spike is morally ambiguous and ready to fight pretty much anyone, for fun. But underneath it all, he loves deeply and earnestly in a way that remains achingly human. Although, ironically, his personality remains pretty much the same, whether he has a soul or not ‚Äì in stark (and more entertaining) contrast to Angel.\\" Other Buffyverse vampires to appear on the list included Drusilla (at 10th place), Darla (at 25th place), Vampire Willow (at 32nd place), Harmony Kendall (at 31st place), and the Master (at 39th place). Spike is also featured in Forbes magazine's \\"Hollywood's Most Powerful Vampires\\" list along with Angel. For this role James Marsters won Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor in a TV Series (in 2000, 2003) and was nominated for this award in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004. In 1999, Spike won a TV Guide Award for \\"Scariest Villain\\". In 2017 Spike made into the list of \\"25 Villains We Love to Hate from the last 25 years\\" for the 25th anniversary of Syfy.

Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprise their roles from Sturges' 1940 film The Great McGinty. The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, which was filmed in 1942 and early 1943, but not released until 1944, was nominated for a 1945 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and in 2001, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" The film ranks #54 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top 100 funniest films in movie history. The 1958 film Rock-A-Bye Baby, starring Jerry Lewis, was loosely based on The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. Sturges received a credit for that film, but did not actually participate in the project. The Miracle of Morgan's Creek is one of the few Paramount sound films produced before 1950 that do not belong to EMKA, Ltd., along with Sorry, Wrong Number and The Buccaneer. Plot Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) is the daughter of the police chief (William Demarest) of the small fictional Midwestern town of Morgan's Creek. Against her father's orders, she attends a wild farewell party for a group of soldiers at which she hits her head on a chandelier while dancing. The next morning, Trudy is in a daze and slowly begins to recall the previous night's events. She had married a soldier but cannot t remember his name, except that \\"it had a z in it. Like Ratzkywatzky [...] or was it Zitzkywitzky?\\" She believes that she and the groom had used fake names, so she doesn't know how to get in touch with him and cannot remember what he looks like. She also does not have the marriage license. The matter is complicated when Trudy learns that she became pregnant that night as well. Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), a local 4-F boy who has been in love with Trudy for years, steps in to help out, but Trudy's overprotective father becomes involved and complicates matters. Norval and Trudy devise a plan: he will wear a uniform and they will get married secretly under false names, which will provide her a marriage certificate with the fake name of Ratzkywatzky and help her avoid the scandal that would be involved with having a child out of wedlock. Later, Trudy will get a divorce, and she and Norval will get married legitimately. At the rushed wedding ceremony, a frazzled Norval mistakenly signs his real name, and the minister calls the police. Norval is brought to the Kockenlocker house where military, state and federal officers fight with Constable Kockenlocker over jurisdiction. Norval is accused of abducting Trudy, impersonating a soldier, impairing the morals of a minor, resisting arrest and perjury. Trudy's father arrests Norval and locks him in the town jail. Trudy then tells her father the truth about the marriage, her pregnancy and Norval's attempt to pose as her groom, and he agrees to let Norval escape so that Norval can find Trudy's real husband. Needing money to begin his quest but with the bank where he works closed for the night, Norval sneaks into the bank with the constable's assistance to take $900 while leaving his bonds there that are worth the same amount. While trying to open a safe, Norval trips the burglar alarm, so Trudy and her sister Emmy tie up their father at the police station to make it look as if he had been incapacitated by a burglar. After months in hiding, Norval appears at his attorney's office, where he learns that the constable was fired after his ruse was not believed and that the Kockenlockers have moved out of town. Norval's attorney urges him to disappear, but Norval is determined to find Trudy. However, he is spotted in town by the bank manager, who alerts the police. Near the end of her pregnancy at Christmas time, the constable approaches the city council to tell them that Trudy wants to tell the real story and exonerate Norval. But before she can do so, Trudy goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to sextuplets, all boys. After receiving the news, Governor McGinty (Brian Donlevy) and The Boss (Akim Tamiroff) demand that Norval be set free, with the charges dropped.Meek, James Plot summary (IMDb)Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)TCM Full synopsis News of Trudy's multiple birth flashes around the world, enraging both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. A newspaper states that Canada is \\"highly dubious\\" (a clear reference to the Dionne quintuplets). When Norval discovers that Trudy has given birth to six boys, he faints, and the film ends with this epilogue on a title card: Cast Half-height 1944 poster Cast notes: *Both Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprised their roles from Sturges' 1940 comedy The Great McGinty. *This was the first time that Preston Sturges and Eddie Bracken worked together on a feature film, although Bracken had appeared in Safeguarding Military Information, a 1942 propaganda short that Sturges wrote. Bracken would go on to appear in Sturges' next film, Hail the Conquering Hero. *Many members of Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors appear in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, among them Al Bridge, Georgia Caine, Chester Conklin, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest, Robert Dudley, Byron Foulger, Esther Howard, Arthur Hoyt, J.

In September 1942, Paramount sold a number of films, such as I Married a Witch, to United Artists, which needed to keep its distribution pipeline filled,TCM \\"I Married a Witch\\" Notes but Paramount held on to The Miracle of Morgan's Creek because it was directed by Sturges, waiting for an opportunity to release it.TCM Notes Problems arose with Hays Office censors because of the film's subject matter. In October 1942, after a story conference, the office sent Paramount a seven-page letter outlining their concerns, including those about lines spoken by the 14-year-old character Emmy and the Trudy character having been drunk and then pregnant. The office wanted the filmmakers to be \\"extremely careful in handling a subject of this kind because of the delicate nature of the high point of the story,\\" and to refrain from reiterating the basic facts of the story after they have been presented. In December 1942, they also warned about making any comparisons between Trudy's situation and the virgin birth of Jesus. There were so many objections from the censors that Sturges began production with only ten approved script pages.Nixon, Rob & Tatara, Paul \\"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\\" (TCM article) The War Department had concerns with the film's portrayal of the departing soldiers, demanding that the film \\"should result in giving the audience the feeling that these boys are normal, thoroughly fit American soldiers who have had an evening of clean fun.\\" Sturges' intent was to \\"show what happens to young girls who disregard their parents' advice and who confuse patriotism with promiscuity,\\" and had included in his script a sermon for the pastor to deliver, expressing Sturges' opinions, but the scene was cut by the studio because the pastor was depicted in too comic a manner. The Miracle of Morgan's Creek was in production from October 21 to December 23, 1942, with additional scenes shot on February 25, 1943.TCM Overview Outdoor scenes were shot at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, California.IMDb Filming locations The film premiered at New York's Paramount Theatre on January 19, 1944. To promote the film, Paramount aired a 20-minute preview on the some 400 television sets then in use in New York City on March 21, 1944, with stills from the film, narration by Eddie Bracken and an interview with Diana Lynn. Paramount asked reviewers not to reveal the ending to avoid spoiling it for those who had not yet seen the film. It is believed that Sturges also withheld the ending from the Hays Office. The film was released on DVD and VHS on September 6, 2005.TCM Misc. notes Reception The Miracle of Morgan's Creek received critical praise. Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times: \\"a more audacious picture a more delightfully irreverent onethan this new lot of nonsense at the Paramount has never come slithering madly down the path. Mr. Sturges ... has hauled off this time and tossed a satire which is more cheeky than all the rest. ... It's hard to imagine how he ever got away with such a thing, how he ever persuaded the Hays boys that he wasn't trying to undermine all morals. ... Maybe the humor is forced a little, and it may be slightly difficult at times to understand precisely what in heck is going on. But that doesn't make any difference. At those times, you can catch your breath.\\" Writing in the Los Angeles Times, reviewer Edwin Schallert wrote: \\"It is a feature that is intensely, even stridently, a departure from the normal Hollywood output. ... you can have all the fun you wish out of this picture if you won't try to take it too seriously at any time. It belongs essentially to the screwball comedy school, and goes to most outlandish lengths in its climax, which has the misfortune to show up the whole thing.\\" Critic James Agee noted that \\"the Hays office has either been hypnotized into a liberality for which it should be thanked, or has been raped in its sleep\\" to allow the film to be released. In a second review, Agee described the film as \\"a little like taking a nun on a roller coaster.\\" Although the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of its subject matter, the film was Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1944, taking in nine million dollars in box-office receipts while playing to standing-room-only audiences in some theaters. Awards and honors Sturges was nominated for a 1945 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, the same year in which he was nominated for the same award for Hail the Conquering Hero. The National Board of Review nominated the film for Best Picture of 1944, and awarded Betty Hutton the award for Best Acting for her performance in the film. The New York Times named it as one of the 10 Best Films of 1942‚Äì1944.Allmovie Awards In 2001, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" The film also holds position #54 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top 100 funniest films in movie history, and in 2006 was voted by Premiere one of \\"The 50 Greatest Comedies of All Time.\\" The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists: * 1998: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies ‚Äì Nominated * 2000: AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs ‚Äì #54 * 2007: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) ‚Äì Nominated See also  The Dionne quintuplets ‚Äì headline \\"Canada Protests\\" (finale) References External links   Category:1944 films Category:1940s romantic comedy films Category:1940s screwball comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American satirical films Category:American screwball comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Preston Sturges Category:Films set on the home front during World War II Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:Films with screenplays by Preston Sturges Category:1944 comedy films ","title":"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"},{"id":"74959","text":"Conjunction may refer to: * Conjunction (astronomy), in which two astronomical bodies appear close together in the sky * Conjunction (astrology), astrological aspect in horoscopic astrology * Conjunction (grammar), a part of speech * Logical conjunction, a mathematical operator * Conjunction introduction, a rule of inference of propositional logic * Conjunctions, an American literary journal ","title":"Conjunction"},{"id":"74960","text":"Miss Lulu Bett is a 1920 novel by American writer Zona Gale, later adapted for the stage. It was a bestseller at the time of its initial publication, but gradually fell out of favor through changing tastes and social conditions.  Plot summary The story concerns a woman, Lulu, who lives with her sister's family, essentially acting as a servant. She does not complain about her position, but is not happy. When her brother-in-law's brother, Ninian, comes to visit, there is a certain attraction between them. While joking around one evening they find themselves accidentally married, due to the laws of the state requiring little more than wedding vows to be recited while a magistrate is in the room for a marriage to count as legal. On learning this, Ninian and Lulu decide they like the idea of being married, and choose to remain together. However, within a month, Lulu is back home, having discovered that Ninian was already legally married: 18 years prior he had wed a girl who left him after 2 years, but he had forgotten about it. Lulu considers this a reasonable story, but her brother-in-law, Dwight, insists that it would be a humiliation to the family to reveal such a thing, and insists that she tell everyone instead that Ninian grew bored with her and left her. Lulu is unable to see why this should be a less humiliating story, and begins to complain about her circumstances for the first time. She also notices that her teenage niece, Di, is unhappy, and also seems to be trying to use marriage as a way to escape her circumstance. Lulu eventually has to prevent Di from eloping, and is finally inspired to move out of her sister's home and live independently. Adaptations Gale first adapted the novel for a play that opened on Broadway on December 27, 1920 starring Carroll McComas. Two endings were written for the play, the original as seen in December 1920 (and the ending that won Gale the Pulitzer Prize from Drama; the first woman ever to do so) has Lulu starting a life on her own and undertaking adventures of her own as we hear in her final lines, \\"Good-by. Good-by, all of you. I'm going I don't know where-to work at I don't know what. But I'm going from choice!\\" The revised ending is more typical and would have been a bit more commercially acceptable and far less challenging to the audiences of the day. In this ending, Ninian appears just as Lulu decides to go off on her own life to work and live elsewhere. He asks her forgiveness and she agrees saying \\"I forgave you in Savannah, Georgia.\\" In 1921 the work was adapted for a silent film of the same name by Clara Beranger, directed by William C. deMille, starring Lois Wilson, Milton Sills, Theodore Roberts, Helen Ferguson, Mabel Van Buren, Ethel Wales and May Giraci.

The film is a comment on the desperate employment and financial conditions many people faced during the Great Depression ‚Äî conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization. The movie stars Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin. It is notable for being the last time that Chaplin portrayed the iconic Little Tramp character. In 1989, Modern Times was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Fourteen years later, it was screened \\"out of competition\\" at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The Tramp working on the giant machine in the film's most famous scene Charlie Chaplin as The Tramp Modern Times portrays Chaplin in his Tramp persona as a factory worker employed on an assembly line. There, he is subjected to such indignities as being force-fed by a malfunctioning \\"feeding machine\\" and an accelerating assembly line where he screws nuts at an ever- increasing rate onto pieces of machinery. He finally suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok; getting stuck within a machine and throwing the factory into chaos. He is sent to a hospital. Following his recovery, the now unemployed factory worker is mistakenly arrested as an instigator in a Communist demonstration. In jail, he accidentally ingests smuggled cocaine, mistaking it for salt. In his subsequent delirium, he avoids being put back in his cell. When he returns, he stumbles upon a jailbreak and knocks the convicts unconscious. He is hailed as a hero and given special treatment. When he is informed that he will soon be released due to his heroic actions, he argues unsuccessfully that he prefers life in jail. Outside of jail, he applies for a new job but leaves after causing an accident. He runs into a recently orphaned barefoot girl, Ellen, also called \\"The Gamin\\" (Paulette Goddard), who is fleeing the police after stealing a loaf of bread. Determined to go back to jail and to save the girl, he tells police that he is the thief and ought to be arrested. A witness reveals his deception and he is freed. To get arrested again, he eats an enormous amount of food at a cafeteria without paying. He meets up with Ellen in a paddy wagon, which crashes, and she convinces him to escape with her. Dreaming of a better life, he gets a job as a night watchman at a department store, sneaks Ellen into the store, and encounters three burglars: one of whom is \\"Big Bill\\", a fellow worker from the factory at the beginning of the film, who explains that they are hungry and desperate. After sharing drinks with them, he wakes up the next morning during opening hours and is arrested one more time for failing to call the police on the burglars and for sleeping in store's clothes on a desk, thus shocking a customer and the storekeeper. Ten days later, Ellen takes him to a new home ‚Äì a run-down shack that she admits is \\"no Buckingham Palace\\" but will do. The next morning, the factory worker reads about an old factory re-opening and lands a job there as a mechanic's assistant. His boss accidentally falls into the machinery, but the worker manages to extricate him. The other workers suddenly decide to go on strike. Outside, the worker accidentally launches a brick at a policeman and is arrested again. Two weeks later, he is released and learns that Ellen is a caf√© dancer. She gets him a job as a singer and waiter, where he goes about his duties rather clumsily. During his floor show, he loses his cuffs, which bear the lyrics to his song, but he rescues the act by improvising the lyrics using gibberish from multiple languages, plus some pantomiming. His act proves a hit. When police arrive to arrest Ellen for her earlier escape, the two flee again. Ellen despairs that there's no point to their struggling, but the factory worker assures her that they'll make it somehow. At a bright dawn, they walk down the road towards an uncertain but hopeful future. Cast Production Paulette Goddard, the heroine of Modern Times During a European tour promoting City Lights, Chaplin got the inspiration for Modern Times from both the lamentable conditions of the continent through the Great Depression, along with a conversation with Mahatma Gandhi in which they discussed modern technology. Chaplin did not understand why Gandhi generally opposed it, though he granted that \\"machinery with only consideration of profit\\" had put people out of work and ruined lives. Chaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first \\"talkie\\", and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects and sparse dialogue. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of his \\"Little Tramp\\" character would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen. Most of the film was shot at \\"silent speed\\", 18 frames per second, which when projected at \\"sound speed\\", 24 frames per second, made the slapstick action appear even more frenetic. The duration of filming was long for the time, beginning on October 11, 1934, and ending on August 30, 1935.As said in Chaplin Today: Modern Times, a 2003 French documentary. The reference to drugs seen in the prison sequence is somewhat daring for the time (since the production code, established in 1930, forbade the depiction of illegal drug use in films); Chaplin had made drug references before in one of his most famous short films, Easy Street, released in 1917. Music According to the official documents, the music score was composed by Chaplin himself, and arranged with the assistance of Alfred Newman, who had collaborated with Chaplin on the music score of his previous film City Lights. Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the Modern Times soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman's angry departure. The romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard \\"Smile\\", first recorded by Nat King Cole. Modern Times was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard as he performs L√©o Daniderff's comical song \\"Je cherche apr√®s Titine\\". Chaplin's version is also known as \\"The Nonsense Song\\", as his character sings it in gibberish. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel's speeches in The Great Dictator. According to film composer David Raksin, he wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. Chaplin would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to \\"take this down\\". Raksin's job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Along with Edward B. Powell, Raksin did receive screen credit for the music arrangements. Raksin later created scores for films including Laura and The Day After. Reception World premiere of Modern Times (1936), New York Modern Times is often hailed as one of Chaplin's greatest achievements, and it remains one of his most popular films. It holds an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.02/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A slapstick skewering of industrialized America, Modern Times is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.\\" Metacritic reports an aggregated score of 96/100 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Contemporary reviews were very positive. Frank Nugent of The New York Times wrote, \\"'Modern Times' has still the same old Charlie, the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet and prankish eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audience's funnybone or hold it still, taut beneath the spell of human tragedy ... Time has not changed his genius.\\" Variety called it \\"grand fun and sound entertainment.\\" Film Daily wrote, \\"Charlie Chaplin has scored one of his greatest triumphs.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that Chaplin \\"manufactures some superb laughs ... In all, it's a rambling sketch, a little at loose ends at times, sometimes rather slight in effect, and now and then secure in its rich, old-fashioned funniness.\\" Burns Mantle called the film \\"another hilariously rowdy success.\\" Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene strongly praised the film, noting that although there had always been a bit of a dated feel to his previous works, Chaplin \\"has at last definitely entered the contemporary scene\\". Greene noted that whereas prior Chaplin films had featured \\"fair and featureless\\" heroines, the casting of Paulette Goddard suggested that his female characters might be presented with more personality than previously. He also voiced concern that the film would be considered to be a Communist film when in reality Chaplin's message was predominantly apolitical. As Greene explains, \\"[Chaplin] presents, he doesn't offer political solutions.\\" (reprinted in: ) French philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merlau-Ponty named their journal, Les Temps modernes, after it. The film did not perform as well commercially at the US box office, but returns in other countries meant it was profitable. It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1935‚Äì36. The iconic depiction of Chaplin working frantically to keep up with an assembly line inspired later comedy routines including Disney's Der Fuehrer's Face (Donald Duck alternately assembling artillery shells and saluting portraits of Adolf Hitler) and an episode of I Love Lucy titled \\"Job Switching\\" (Lucy and Ethel trying to keep up with an ever-increasing volume of chocolate candies, eventually stuffing them in their mouths, hats, and blouses). The opening of a fantasy sequence in the film, in which the unemployed factory worker trips over a footstool upon entering the living room of his \\"dream home\\" with the Gamin, inspired a similar opening to The Dick Van Dyke Show. This was Chaplin's first overtly political-themed film, and its unflattering portrayal of industrial society generated controversy in some quarters upon its initial release. Writing in The Liberal News, the official magazine of the British Liberal Party, in October 1936, Willoughby Dewar observed \\"[Modern Times] should be seen by every Young Liberal. It is, among other things, a piece of first-class Liberal propaganda.\\" Nazi Germany propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned the film from being shown in the regime because of its alleged advocacy of communism. The film exhibits slight similarities to a lesser known 1931 French film directed by Ren√© Clair entitled √Ä nous la libert√© (Liberty for Us) ‚Äì the assembly line sequence is an instance in that both films depict it, but in different ways. The German film company Tobis Film, hungry for cash, sued Chaplin following the film's release to no avail. They sued again after World War II (considered revenge for Chaplin's anti-Nazi statements in The Great Dictator). This time, they settled with Chaplin out of court. Clair, a huge admirer of Chaplin who was flattered that the film icon would depict similar subject, but was deeply embarrassed that Tobis Film would sue Chaplin, was never part of the case. The film did attract criticism for being almost completely silent, despite the movie industry having long since embraced the talking picture. Chaplin famously feared that the mystery and romanticism of the Tramp character would be ruined if he spoke, and feared it would alienate his fans in non-English speaking territories. His future films, however, would be fully fledged \\"talkies\\" ‚Äì although without the character of the Little Tramp. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has written of the reception and legacy of this classic comedy, > Modern Times is perhaps more meaningful now than at any time since its first > release. The twentieth-century theme of the film, farsighted for its > time‚Äîthe struggle to eschew alienation and preserve humanity in a modern, > mechanized world‚Äîprofoundly reflects issues facing the twenty-first century. > The Tramp's travails in Modern Times and the comedic mayhem that ensues > should provide strength and comfort to all who feel like helpless cogs in a > world beyond control. Through its universal themes and comic inventiveness, > Modern Times remains one of Chaplin's greatest and most enduring works. > Perhaps more important, it is the Tramp's finale, a tribute to Chaplin's > most beloved character and the silent-film era he commanded for a > generation.

Hoberman-NYR Daily-The New York Review of Books The film is recognized as a landmark work in American experimental cinema, particularly as an early example of found footage. A Movie was inducted into the National Film Registry in 1994. Content A Movie has multiple false endings announced in its intertitles. A Movie opens with its longest shot, an extended production credit with Bruce Conner's name. After the opening credits, the countdown leader is interrupted by a shot of an undressed woman removing her stockings. Once the countdown completes, an intertitle falsely announces \\"The End\\" of the film. The film moves into a montage of cavalry, tanks, race cars, and a charging elephant.Sterritt 2013, pp. 95‚Äì96. Another false ending precedes footage of zeppelins and tightrope walkers. In one well-known sequence, a man in a submarine looks through a periscope to see a woman posing in a bikini, leading to the launch of a torpedo and a mushroom cloud. This leads to water sporting accidents and racing mishaps. As the musical score swells, a succession of violent scenes ensues, including aerial bombings, the Hindenburg disaster, and firing squads. The film closes with a scuba diver exploring a shipwreck.Sterritt 2013, pp. 96‚Äì98. Background Bruce Conner developed the concept for A Movie many years before he began working on it. He was inspired early on by a battle scene in the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup that builds a montage from stock footage. He envisioned a film combining images and sounds from many different movies and, when watching movies, often imagined possible sequences that could be created from them.Conner 2010, p. 93. Conner and Larry Jordan began the Camera Obscura Film Society during the late 1950s. Conner was interested in the film leader used by projectionists that went unseen by the audience. He had a filmstrip given to him by writer Lee Streiff which showed a nude woman, and he thought about inserting the strip in the countdown leader at a Camera Obscura screening of Triumph of the Will. When Jordan found out about the plan, he threatened to quit the society. Conner decided that the only way for him to carry out this vision would be to insert such a sequence in a film of his own. Production Jordan showed Conner how to edit film and offered him the use of a Griswold film splicer.Wees 1993, p. 81. Describing cinema as \\"a rich man's art form\\", Conner looked to store-bought footage as an economical alternative to shooting original material.Sterritt 2013, p. 93. He purchased a condensed Hopalong Cassidy western, a short novelty film called Thrills and Spills, a Castle home movie containing German propaganda, and a newsreel compilation titled Headlines of 1953.Piranio 1999, p. 188.Zimmermann and MacDonald 2017, p. 172. Conner primarily worked in assemblage at the time, and he originally planned to use the film as part of an installation piece. The installation would fill a cube into which people could walk. The film would have no soundtrack; instead, the installation would play the film as a loop with sound coming from tape players, radio, and television. However, Conner was not able to fulfill his original vision. The cost of a rear projection machine for the installation was prohibitively expensive.Aitken 2006, p. 93. He decided to make the film a stand-alone work and edited the segments together using a radio to time them. During one editing session, Respighi's Pines of Rome came on the radio and synced well with the ending. Pines of Rome had been used ten years earlier by Kenneth Anger for his avant- garde short film Fireworks.Piranio 1999, p. 189.SHINE A LIGHT: THE ART OF BRUCE CONNER-Artfourm International Conner made a recording from the first, second, and fourth movements and added the music to the completed image track. He was unsure how to clear the rights to the music and used the recording without authorization. He completed the film on a budget of $350 (). Release A Movie premiered June 10, 1958, at the East and West Gallery in San Francisco. It was part of a reception for Conner's first solo art show. Shortly after, the film was acquired for distribution by Cinema 16 in New York. When local distributor Canyon Cinema emerged in the early 1960s, A Movie was one of its more well-known offerings.MacDonald 2008, p. 249. Legacy At its 1960 Creative Film Awards Presentation, the Creative Film Foundation gave A Movie an Award of Distinction, with Michael McClure describing its comedy \\"not [as] a free laugh but the reconstruction of human depth, achievement and emotion\\".Vogel 2002, p. 385. It has gone on to be recognized as a landmark piece of avant-garde cinema.Frieling and Garrels 2016, p. 9. In 1994, A Movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Filmmaker Peter Hutton has cited A Movie as an influence on his work.MacDonald 1998, p. 250. Artist Christian Marclay first saw the film as a student, and it influenced his own practice of appropriating materials and establishing new connections between them.Frieling and Garrels 2016, p. 202.

The angry lady tells a policeman (Sam Lufkin) on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\"). Meanwhile, the piano has rolled down the steps again. The two doggedly persist in carrying the piano up the stairs for a third time. Halfway up, they encounter the short-tempered and pompous Professor Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen (Billy Gilbert), M.D., A.D., D.D.S., F.L.D., F-F-F-and-F. He impatiently tells them to take the piano out of his way; he should like to pass. Ollie very reasonably and sensibly suggests he walk around, which sets off the Professor in a fit of Teutonic rage. He screams at Stan and Ollie to get the piano out of his way, and Stan knocks the Professor's top hat down the stairs and into the street, where it is crushed by a passing vehicle. The outraged professor leaves, loudly threatening to have the two arrested. Finally, Stan and Ollie get the piano to the top, where Ollie falls into a fountain. As they ring the bell of 1127 Walnut Avenue, the piano rolls back down to the street again. They wearily drag it back up the stairs, and meet the postman by the house, who informs them they did not have to lift the piano up the stairs; they could have driven up the hill and stopped in front of the house. Stan and Ollie promptly carry the piano back down the stairs, put it back in their wagon and drive it up the hill to the house. Finding no one home, they finally succeed in getting the piano in the house, after dropping it into the fountain and falling in themselves. They make a shambles of the living room while unpacking it. Meanwhile, the owner of 1127 Walnut Avenue is revealed to be Professor von Schwartzenhoffen, who returns and is outraged at what he finds, as he hates pianos. He attacks the piano with an axe, destroying it, but regrets his actions when his wife returns home and tearfully tells her husband it had been a surprise birthday present. To apologize for his actions, the Professor signs the delivery receipt, but the pen Stan and Ollie give him squirts ink over his face. Furious, Schwartzenhoffen blows his temper again and makes the duo run away.

(1925), during a scene in which Chase is trying to sell fountain pens to Fay Wray. The steps are also used, for a gag similar to Hats Off and The Music Box, in Ice Cold Cocos (1926), a Billy Bevan comedy short directed by Del Lord.SilentEra entry for Ice Cold Cocos. silentera.com The steps are also referenced in The Laurel and Hardy Love Affair, a short story by Ray Bradbury, as the meeting place of the couple in the story, who call each other Ollie and Stan in homage to the comedic duo. Although similar in appearance, the staircase is not the same one used by The Three Stooges in their 1941 film An Ache in Every Stake. Those stairs (147 steps in length) are approximately two miles northeast, located at 2212 Edendale Place in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Reception The short was popular with audiences in 1932 and generally well received by critics. After previewing The Music Box in late February that year, the New York trade paper The Film Daily assured theater owners that the comedy \\"is up to the Laurel-Hardy standard, and should score easily.\\"\\"Laurel and Hardy in 'The Music Box'\\", review, The Film Daily (New York, N.Y.), February 28, 1932, p. 12. Internet Archive. Retrieved May 12, 2019. Motion Picture Herald, after previewing the film in March, described it as \\"great fun\\" and noted, \\"Unusually long for a comedy [short], it is well worth the extra length.\\"\\"SHORTS / The Music Box / (MGM)\\", review, Motion Picture Herald (New York, N.Y.), March 12, 1932, p. 57. Internet Archive. Retrieved May 12, 2019. The Chicago-based movie magazine Motion Picture is even more enthusiastic about the comedy in its June 1932 issue: Not all contemporary reviews, however, were positive. Variety, the entertainment industry's leading paper in 1932, did not publish its review of The Music Box until November 22, over seven months after MGM officially released the short to theaters. That publication date is also four days after Laurel and Hardy's film received an Academy Award for being the best comedy short released between August 1, 1931, and July 31, 1932. Despite that recognition of excellence and the public's favorable response to the film, the reviewer for Variety, New York critic Alfred Greason, found the short's overall script lacking. He expressed disappointment too with Stan and Ollie's performances and with the film's ending and pacing: One odd, seemingly inexplicable aspect of Greason's unfavorable review is his description of the Academy Award winner being a 15-minute short, only half the film's actual length. A single reference to such a drastically reduced running time could be construed as a possible editing or typographical error, but the time is cited twice by the veteran critic: once in his review's heading and again at the end of the review, where Greason notes, \\"Finish is only so-so and the subject doesn't hold up pace for its 15 minutes.\\" Remakes *The film is a partial remake of their silent short Hats Off (1927), which was filmed at the same location and is today considered a lost film.Brennan, John V.; Larrabee, John (2012). \\"The Silents: Hats Off\\", Laurel and Hardy Central.

In a literary work, film, story or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of events linked by the connector \\"and so\\". Plots can vary from the simple‚Äîsuch as in a traditional ballad‚Äîto forming complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot or imbroglio. In common usage (for example, a \\"movie plot\\"), however, it can mean a narrative summary or story synopsis, rather than a specific cause-and-effect sequence. Plot is similar in meaning to the term storyline.Random House Dictionary. \\"plot.\\"Oxford Dictionaries. \\"storyline.\\" In the narrative sense, the term highlights important points which have consequences within the story, according to Ansen Dibell. The term plot can also serve as a verb, referring to the writer's crafting of a plot (devising and ordering story events) or to a character's planning future actions in the story.  Definition  English novelist E. M. Forster described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, \\"The king died, and then the queen died, is a story, while The king died, and then the queen died of grief, is a plot.\\"Forster, E.M. Aspects of the Novel. Mariner Books. (1956) Teri Shaffer Yamada agrees that a plot does not include memorable scenes within a story which do not relate directly to other events but only \\"major events that move the action in a narrative.\\" For example, in the 1997 film Titanic, when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she's flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene which is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite. = Cinderella = Consider the following: ::#The prince searches for Cinderella with the glass shoe ::#Cinderella's sisters tried the shoe on but it does not fit ::#The shoe fits Cinderella's foot so the prince finds her The first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Dibell, the plot can be described numerically as 1‚Üí3 while the story can be described as 1‚Üí2‚Üí3. A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence. =The Wizard of Oz= Steve Alcorn, a fiction-writing coach, says that the main plot elements of The Wizard of Oz are easy to find, and include: = Fabula and syuzhet = The literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the fabula (—Ñ–∞ÃÅ–±—É–ª–∞) and the syuzhet (—Å—é–∂–µÃÅ—Ç). A fabula is the events in the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster's definition. The fabula (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the syuzhet (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non- chronological order; for example, fabula is 1, a2, a3, a4, a5, ..., an>, syuzhet is 5, a1, a3>. The Russian formalist, Viktor Shklovsky, viewed the syuzhet as the fabula defamiliarized. Defamiliarization or ‚Äúmaking strange,‚Äù a term Shklovsky coined and popularized, upends familiar ways of presenting a story, slows down the reader's perception, and makes the story appear unfamiliar.Victor Shklovsky, ‚ÄúArt as Technique,‚Äù in Russian Formalist Criticism: Four Essays, 2nd ed., trans. Lee T. Lemon and Marion J. Reis (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 2012), 3-24. Shklovsky cites Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy as an example of a fabula that has been defamiliarized.Shklovsky, \\"Sterne's Tristram Shandy: Stylistic Commentary\\" in Russian Formalist Criticism, 25-57. Sterne uses temporal displacements, digressions, and causal disruptions (for example, placing the effects before their causes) to slow down the reader's ability to reassemble the (familiar) story. As a result, the syuzhet ‚Äúmakes strange‚Äù the fabula.  Structure  Today screenwriters generally combine plot with plot structure into what is called a treatment, sometimes referred to as the three-act structure, in which a film is divided into three acts: the set-up, the confrontation and the resolution. Acts are connected by two plot points or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter Syd Field who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.  Aristotle  The Greek philosopher Aristotle, writing in the fourth century BC in his classic book The Poetics, considered plot or mythos as the most important element of drama, even more important than character. Aristotle wrote that a tragedy, a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. He also believed that the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable. Of the utmost importance is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the psyche of the audience, he thought. In tragedy, the appropriate emotions are fear and pity, emotions which he considers in his Rhetoric. (Aristotle's work on comedy has not survived.) Aristotle goes on to consider whether the tragic character suffers (pathos), and whether the tragic character commits the error with knowledge of what he is doing. He illustrates this with the question of a tragic character who is about to kill someone in his family. ::The worst situation [artistically] is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances, for example, Haemon and Creon in Antigone. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the discovery will serve to astound us. But the best of all is the last; what we have in Cresphontes, for example, where Merope, on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time; in Iphigenia, where sister and brother are in a like position; and in Helle, where the son recognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her enemy.(Poetics book 14)  Freytag  Freytag's pyramid In 1863, Gustav Freytag, a German writer, advocated a model based upon Aristotle's theory of tragedy. This is now called \\"Freytag's pyramid,\\" which divides a drama into five parts, and provides function to each part. These parts are: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and denouement (catastrophe). = Exposition = The first phase in Freytag's pyramid is the exposition, which introduces the characters, especially the main character, also known as the protagonist. It shows how the characters relate to one another, their goals and motivations, as well as their moral character. During the exposition, the protagonist learns their main goal and what is at stake. = Rising action = Rising action is the second phase in Freytag's five-phase structure. It starts with a conflict, for example, the death of a character. The inciting incident is the point of the plot that begins the conflict. It is the event that catalyzes the protagonist to go into motion and to take action. Rising action involves the buildup of events until the climax. In this phase, the protagonist understands his or her goal and begins to work toward it. Smaller problems thwart their initial success and their progress is directed primarily against these secondary obstacles. This phase demonstrates how the protagonist overcomes these obstacles. = Climax = The climax is the turning point or highest point of the story. The protagonist makes the single big decision that defines not only the outcome of the story, but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as the third of the five dramatic phases which occupies the middle of the story. At the beginning of this phase, the protagonist finally clears away the preliminary barriers and engages with the adversary. Usually, both the protagonist and the antagonist have a plan to win against the other as they enter this phase. For the first time, the audience sees the pair going against one another in direct or nearly direct conflict. This struggle usually results in neither character completely winning or losing. In most cases, each character's plan is both partially successful and partially foiled by their adversary. The central struggle between the two characters is unique in that the protagonist makes a decision which shows their moral quality, and ultimately decides their fate. In a tragedy, the protagonist here makes a poor decision or a miscalculation that demonstrates their tragic flaw. = Falling action = According to Freytag, the falling action phase consists of events that lead to the ending. Character's actions resolve the problem. In the beginning of this phase, the antagonist often has the upper hand. The protagonist has never been further from accomplishing their goal. The outcome depends on which side the protagonist has put themselves on. = Denouement = In this phase the protagonist and antagonist have solved their problems and either the protagonist or antagonist wins the conflict. The conflict officially ends. Some stories show what happens to the characters after the conflict ends and/or they show what happens to the characters in the future.  Northrop Frye  The influential Canadian literary critic and literary theorist Northrop Frye offers two dramatic structures to analyze narratives: (1) a U-shaped pattern, which is the shape of a comedy, and (2) an inverted U-shaped pattern, which is the shape of a tragedy.Northrop Frye, The Great Code: The Bible and Literature (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982), 169-71. = A U-shaped pattern = ‚ÄúThis U-shaped pattern‚Ä¶recurs in literature as the standard shape of comedy, where a series of misfortunes and misunderstandings brings the action to a threateningly low point, after which some fortunate twist in the plot sends the conclusion up to a happy ending.‚ÄùFrye, 169. A U-shaped plot begins at the top of the U with a state of equilibrium, a state of prosperity or happiness, which is disrupted by disequilibrium or disaster. At the bottom of the U, the direction is reversed by a fortunate twist, divine deliverance, an awakening of the protagonist to his or her tragic circumstances, or some other action or event that results in an upward turn of the plot. Aristotle referred to the reversal of direction as peripeteia or peripety, which depends frequently on a recognition or discovery by the protagonist. Aristotle called this discovery an anagnorisis‚Äîa change from ‚Äúignorance to knowledge‚Äù involving ‚Äúmatters which bear on prosperity or adversity‚Äù. The protagonist recognizes something of great importance that was previously hidden or unrecognized. The reversal occurs at the bottom of the U and moves the plot upward to a new stable condition marked by prosperity, success, or happiness. At the top of the U, equilibrium is restored. = An inverted U-shaped structure = The inverted U begins with the protagonist‚Äôs rise to a position of prominence and well-being. At the top of the inverted U, the character enjoys good fortune and well- being. But a crisis or a turning point occurs, which marks the reversal of the protagonist‚Äôs fortunes and begins the descent to disaster. Sometimes a recognition scene occurs where the protagonist sees something of great importance that was previously unrecognized. The final state is disaster and adversity, the bottom of the inverted U.  Plot devices  A plot device is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique. Familiar types of plot devices include the deus ex machina, the MacGuffin, the red herring, and Chekhov's gun.  Plot outline  A plot outline is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a \\"one page\\" because of its length. It is generally longer and more detailed than a standard synopsis, which is usually only one or two paragraphs, but shorter and less detailed than a treatment or a step outline. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the nemu (pronounced like the English word \\"name\\"). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are to: * lay out the flow of panels across a page * ensure the story successfully builds suspense * work out points of view, camera angles, and character positions within panels * serve as a basis for the next stage of development, the \\"pencil\\" stage, where detailed drawings are produced in a more polished layout which will, in turn, serve as the basis for the inked drawings. In fiction writing, a plot outline is a laundry list of scenes with each line being a separate plot point, and the outline helps give a story a \\"solid backbone and structure\\".  A-Plot  An A-Plot is a cinema and television term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.  Plot summary  A plot summary is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to and it is usually no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story.

Category:Narrative techniques ","title":"Plot (narrative)"},{"id":"74978","text":"My Darling Clementine is a 1946 American Western film directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp during the period leading up to the gunfight at the OK Corral. The ensemble cast also features Victor Mature (as Doc Holliday), Linda Darnell, Walter Brennan, Tim Holt, Cathy Downs and Ward Bond. The title of the movie is borrowed from the theme song \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\\", sung in parts over the opening and closing credits. The screenplay is based on the fictionalized biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal by Stuart Lake, as were two earlier movies, both named Frontier Marshal (released in 1934 and 1939, respectively). My Darling Clementine is regarded by many film critics as one of the best Westerns ever made. In 1991, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry; it was among the first 75 films entered into the registry.  Plot  In 1882 (a year after the actual gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881), Wyatt, Morgan, Virgil, and James Earp are driving cattle to California when they encounter Old Man Clanton and his sons. He offers to buy their herd, but they curtly refuse to sell. When the Earps learn about the nearby boom town of Tombstone, the older brothers ride in, leaving the youngest, James, as watchman. The threesome soon learns that Tombstone is a lawless town without a marshal. Wyatt proves the only man in the town willing to face a drunken Indian shooting at the townspeople. When the brothers return to their camp, they find their cattle rustled and James murdered. Wyatt returns to Tombstone. Seeking to avenge James' murder, he takes the open position of town marshal and encounters the hot-tempered Doc Holliday and scurrilous Clanton gang several times. During this time, Clementine Carter, Doc's former love interest from his hometown of Boston, arrives after a long search for her beau. She is given a room at the same hotel where both Wyatt and Doc Holliday reside. Chihuahua, a hot-tempered Latina love interest of Doc's, sings in the local saloon. She runs afoul of Wyatt trying to tip a professional gambler off to his poker hand, resulting in Wyatt dunking her in a horse trough. Doc, who is suffering badly from tuberculosis and fled from Clementine previously, is unhappy with her arrival; he tells her to return to Boston or he will leave Tombstone. Clementine stays, so Doc leaves for Tucson. Wyatt, who has been taken by Clementine since her arrival, begins to awkwardly court her. Angry over Doc's hasty flight Chihuahua starts an argument with Clementine. Wyatt walks in on their spat and breaks it up. He notices Chihuahua is wearing a silver cross that had been taken from his brother James the night he'd been killed. She claims Doc gave it to her. Wyatt chases down Doc, with whom he has had a testy relationship. Doc forces a shoot-out, ending with Wyatt shooting a pistol out of Doc's hand. The two return to Tombstone, where after being questioned, Chihuahua reveals the silver cross was actually given to her by Billy Clanton. During the interrogation Billy shoots Chihuahua through a window and takes off on horseback, but is wounded by Wyatt. Wyatt directs his brother Virgil to pursue him. The chase leads to the Clanton homestead, where Billy dies of his wounds. Old Man Clanton then shoots Virgil in the back in cold blood. In town, a reluctant Doc is persuaded to operate on Chihuahua. Hope swells for her successful recovery. The Clantons then arrive, toss Virgil's body on the street and announce they will be waiting for the rest of the Earps at the O.K. Corral. Chihuahua dies and Doc decides to join the Earps, walking alongside Wyatt and Morgan to the corral at sunup. A gunfight ensues in which most of the Clantons are killed, as is Doc. Wyatt and Morgan resign as law enforcers. Morgan heads West in a horse and buggy. Wyatt bids Clementine farewell at the school house, wistfully promising that if he ever returns he will look her up. Mounting his horse, muses aloud, \\"Ma'am, I sure like that name...Clementine,\\" and rides off to join his brother.

Lake retold the story in the 1946 book My Darling Clementine, for which Ford acquired the film rights. The two books have since been determined to be largely fictionalized stories about the Earp brothers and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and their conflict with the outlaw Cowboys: Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury and his brother Frank McLaury. The gunfight was relatively unknown to the American public until Lake published the two books and after the movie was made. Director John Ford said that when he was a prop boy in the early days of silent pictures, Earp would visit pals he knew from his Tombstone days on the sets. \\"I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been.\\" Ford did not want to make the movie, but his contract required him to make one more movie for 20th Century Fox. In their later years, Wyatt and Josephine Earp worked hard to eliminate any mention of Josephine's previous relationship with Johnny Behan or Wyatt's previous common law marriage to Matty Blaylock. They successfully kept Josephine's name out of Lake's biography of Wyatt and after he died, Josephine threatened to sue the movie producers to keep it that way. Lake corresponded with Josephine, and he claimed she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers. Josephine insisted she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp's legacy. After the movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (in which John Ireland portrayed another real-life figure of the time, Johnny Ringo) was released in 1957, the shootout came to be known by that name. =Writing= The final script of the movie varies considerably from historical fact to create additional dramatic conflict and character. Clementine Carter is not a historical person, and in this script appears to be an amalgam of Big Nose Kate and Josephine Earp. Unlike the movie characters, the Earps were never cowboys, drovers, or cattle owners. Important plot devices in the film and personal details about the main characters were all liberally adapted for the movie. Old Man Clanton actually died prior to the gunfight and probably never met any of the Earps. Doc was a dentist, not a surgeon, and survived the shootout. James Earp, who was portrayed as the youngest brother and the first to die in the story, actually was the eldest brother and lived until 1926. The key women in Wyatt's and Doc's lives‚ÄîWyatt's common law wife Josephine and Doc's common-law wife Big Nose Kate‚Äîwere not present in Lake's original story and were kept out of the movie as well. The film gives the date of the gunfight as 1882 when it actually occurred in 1881. Upon leaving Tombstone, the itinerant actor, Granville Thorndyke (Alan Mowbray), bids farewell to the old soldier, \\"Dad\\" (Francis Ford (actor), John Ford's elder brother), with lines from Joseph Addison's poem, \\"The Campaign\\": \\"Great Souls by Instinct to each other turn,/Demand Alliance (\\"allegiance\\" in the film), and in Friendship burn...\\" =Filming= Much of the film was shot in Monument Valley, a scenic desert region straddling the Arizona-Utah border used in other John Ford movies. It is 500 miles (800 km) away from the town of Tombstone in southern Arizona. After seeing a preview screening of the film, 20th Century Fox studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck felt Ford's original cut was too long and had some weak spots, so he had Lloyd Bacon shoot new footage and heavily edit the film. Zanuck had Bacon cut 30 minutes from the film. While Ford's original cut of the film has not survived, a \\"pre-release\\" cut‚Äîdating from a few months after the preview screening‚Äîwas discovered in the UCLA film archives; this version preserves some additional footage as well as alternative scoring and editing. UCLA film preservationist Robert Gitt edited a version of the film that incorporates some of the earlier version. Perhaps the most significant change is the film's ending; in Ford's original version, Earp awkwardly shakes hands with Clementine Carter. In the version released in 1946, Earp kisses her on the cheek.  Critical reception  The film is generally regarded as one of the best Westerns made by John Ford and one of his best films overall. At the time of its release, Bosley Crowther lauded the film and wrote, \\"The eminent director, John Ford, is a man who has a way with a Western like nobody in the picture trade. Seven years ago his classic Stagecoach snuggled very close to fine art in this genre. And now, by George, he's almost matched it with My Darling Clementine ... But even with standard Western fiction‚Äîand that's what the script has enjoined‚ÄîMr. Ford can evoke fine sensations and curiously-captivating moods. From the moment that Wyatt and his brothers are discovered on the wide and dusty range, trailing a herd of cattle to a far-off promised land, a tone of pictorial authority is struck‚Äîand it is held. Every scene, every shot is the product of a keen and sensitive eye‚Äîan eye which has deep comprehension of the beauty of rugged people and a rugged world.\\" Director Sam Peckinpah considered My Darling Clementine his favorite Western, and paid homage to it in several of his Westerns, including Major Dundee (1965) and The Wild Bunch (1969). The Variety reviewer wrote, \\"Trademark of John Ford's direction is clearly stamped on the film with its shadowy lights, softly contrasted moods and measured pace, but a tendency is discernible towards stylization for the sake of stylization. At several points, the pic comes to a dead stop to let Ford go gunning for some arty effect\\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating with an average score of 8.79/10, based on 30 reviews. Fifty years after its release, Roger Ebert reviewed the film and included it in his list of The Great Movies. In 2004, Matt Bailey summarized its significance: \\"If there is one film that deserves every word of praise ever uttered or written about it, it is John Ford's My Darling Clementine. Perhaps the greatest film in a career full of great films, arguably the finest achievement in a rich and magnificent genre, and undoubtedly the best version of one of America's most enduring myths, the film is an undeniable and genuine classic.\\" In the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound polls, seven critics and five directors named it one of their 10 favorite films. It was also President Harry Truman's favorite film.

On 31 January 2000, Shipman was found guilty of the murder of 15 patients under his care; his total number of victims was approximately 250. Shipman was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released. He committed suicide by hanging on 13 January 2004, a day before his 58th birthday, in his cell at Wakefield Prison. The Shipman Inquiry, was a two- year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which Dame Janet Smith chaired, examined Shipman's crimes. The inquiry identified 215 victims and estimated his total victim count at 250, about 80 percent of whom were elderly women. Shipman's youngest confirmed victim was a 41-year-old man, although suspicion arose that he had killed patients as young as four. He is the only British doctor known to be guilty of murdering his patients, although other doctors have been acquitted of similar crimes or convicted on lesser charges. Early life and career Harold Frederick Shipman was born on 14 January 1946 on the Bestwood council estate in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England, the second of the three children of Harold Frederick Shipman (12 May 1914 ‚Äì 5 January 1985), a truck driver, and Vera Brittan (23 December 1919 ‚Äì 21 June 1963). His working-class parents were devout Methodists. When growing up, Shipman was an accomplished rugby player in youth leagues. Shipman passed his eleven-plus in 1957, moving to High Pavement Grammar School, Nottingham, which he left in 1964. He excelled as a distance runner, and in his final year at school served as vice-captain of the athletics team. Shipman was particularly close to his mother, who died of lung cancer when he was aged 17.Born to Kill?, Channel 5, 2 August 2012 Her death came in a manner similar to what later became Shipman's own modus operandi: in the later stages of her disease, she had morphine administered at home by a doctor. Shipman witnessed his mother's pain subside, despite her terminal condition, until her death on 21 June 1963. The Early Life of Harold Shipman On 5 November 1966, Shipman married Primrose May Oxtoby; the couple had four children. Shipman studied medicine at Leeds School of Medicine, University of Leeds, graduating in 1970. He began working at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 took his first position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden. In the following year, he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine (Demerol) for his own use. Shipman was fined ¬£600, and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde near Manchester, in 1977. Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s, and established his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993, becoming a respected member of the community. In 1983, he was interviewed in an edition of the Granada Television documentary World in Action on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community. A year after his conviction, the interview was re-broadcast on Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Detection In March 1998, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Sons funeral parlour, Dr Linda Reynolds of the Brooke Surgery in Hyde expressed concerns to John Pollard, the coroner for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of cremation forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. Police were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges, and closed the investigation on 17 April. The Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. After the investigation was closed, Shipman killed three more people. In August, taxi driver John Shaw told the police that he suspected Shipman of murdering 21 patients. Shaw became suspicious as many of the elderly customers he took to the hospital, who seemed to be in good health, died in Shipman's care. Shipman's last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. Shipman was the last person to see her alive; he later signed her death certificate, recording the cause of death as old age. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother, with doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left ¬£386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and found to contain traces of diamorphine (heroin), often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed that Grundy had been an addict, and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, examination of his computer showed that they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a Brother typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will. The police investigated other deaths Shipman had certified and investigated 15 specimen cases. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health. Prescription For Murder, a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, suggested that Shipman forged the will either because he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or because he planned to retire at 55 and leave the UK.Whittle, B and Richie, J. Prescription for Murder: The True Story of Dr. Harold Frederick Shipman. Little Brown (2000), pp. 348‚Äì9. . In 2003, David Spiegelhalter et al. suggested that \\"statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998.\\"Spiegelhalter, D. et al. Risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio tests: application to Bristol, Shipman and adult cardiac surgery. Int J Qual Health Care, vol. 15, pp. 7‚Äì13 (2003). Trial and imprisonment Shipman's trial began at Preston Crown Court on 5 October 1999. He was charged with the murders of 15 women by lethal injections of diamorphine, all between 1995 and 1998: * Marie West * Irene Turner * Lizzie Adams * Jean Lilley * Ivy Lomas * Muriel Grimshaw * Marie Quinn * Kathleen Wagstaff * Bianka Pomfret * Norah Nuttall * Pamela Hillier * Maureen Ward * Winifred Mellor * Joan Melia * Kathleen Grundy His legal representatives tried unsuccessfully to have the Grundy case tried separately from the others, as a motive was shown by the alleged forgery of Grundy‚Äôs will. On 31 January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen counts of murder and one count of forgery. Mr Justice Forbes subsequently sentenced Shipman to life imprisonment on all fifteen counts of murder, with a recommendation that he never be released, to be served concurrently with a sentence of four years for forging Grundy's will. On 11 February, ten days after his conviction, Shipman was struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC). Two years later, Home Secretary David Blunkett confirmed the judge's whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers lost their power to set minimum terms for prisoners. While authorities could have brought many additional charges, they concluded that a fair hearing would be impossible in view of the enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Furthermore, the fifteen life sentences already handed down rendered further litigation unnecessary. Shipman consistently denied his guilt, disputing the scientific evidence against him. He never made any public statements about his actions. Shipman's wife, Primrose, steadfastly maintained her husband's innocence, even after his conviction. Shipman is the only doctor in the history of British medicine found guilty of murdering his patients.Strangerinblood.co.uk Nigel Cox was convicted of attempted murder in 1992, in the death of Lillian Boyes. John Bodkin Adams was charged in 1957 with murdering a patient, amid rumours he had killed dozens more over a 10-year period and \\"possibly provided the role model for Shipman\\". However, he was acquitted. Historian Pamela Cullen has argued that because of Adams' acquittal, there was no impetus to examine the flaws in the British legal system until the Shipman case. Death Shipman hanged himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison at 6:20 am on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 8:10 am. A statement from Her Majesty's Prison Service indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets. After Shipman's death, his body was taken to the mortuary at the Medico Legal Centre for a post-mortem examination. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff eventually released the body to the family after an inquest was opened and adjourned shortly after. Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as Shipman's suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of his confession, nor answers as to why he committed his crimes. Home Secretary David Blunkett said celebration was tempting: \\"You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\\" Shipman's death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a \\"cold coward\\" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. However, The Sun ran a celebratory front-page headline; \\"Ship Ship hooray!\\" The Independent called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by General Sir David Ramsbotham, who had formerly served as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing, for this would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials. Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, though he reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his NHS pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension; she would not have been entitled to it if Shipman had lived past 60. Additionally, there was evidence that Primrose, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman refused to take part in courses which would have encouraged acknowledgement of his crimes, leading to a temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to, \\"Tell me everything, no matter what.\\" A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman's suicide \\"could not have been predicted or prevented,\\" but that procedures should nonetheless be re- examined. After Shipman's body was released to the family, it remained in Sheffield for more than a year despite multiple false reports about his funeral. His widow was advised by police against burying her husband in case the grave was attacked. Shipman was eventually cremated on 19 March 2005 at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium. The cremation took place outside normal hours to maintain secrecy and was attended only by his widow Primrose and their four children. Aftermath In January 2001, Chris Gregg, a senior West Yorkshire detective, was selected to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths. Following this, the Shipman Inquiry, submitted in July 2002, concluded that he had killed at least 215 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practiced in Todmorden (1974‚Äì1975) and Hyde (1977‚Äì1998). Dame Janet Smith, the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more deaths of a suspicious nature could not be definitively ascribed to Shipman. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health. In her sixth and final report, issued on 24 January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at Pontefract General Infirmary. In total, 459 people died while under his care between 1971 and 1998, but it is uncertain how many of those were murder victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death. Smith's estimate of Shipman's total victim count over that 27-year period was 250. The GMC charged six doctors, who signed cremation forms for Shipman's victims, with misconduct, claiming they should have noticed the pattern between Shipman's home visits and his patients' deaths. All these doctors were found not guilty. In October 2005, a similar hearing was held against two doctors who worked at Tameside General Hospital in 1994, who failed to detect that Shipman had deliberately administered a \\"grossly excessive\\" dose of morphine. The Shipman Inquiry recommended changes to the structure of the GMC. In 2005, it came to light that Shipman may have stolen jewellery from his victims. In 1998, police had seized over ¬£10,000 worth of jewellery they found in his garage. In March 2005, when Primrose Shipman asked for its return, police wrote to the families of Shipman's victims asking them to identify the jewellery. Unidentified items were handed to the Assets Recovery Agency in May. The investigation ended in August. Authorities returned 66 pieces to Primrose Shipman and auctioned 33 pieces that she confirmed were not hers. Proceeds of the auction went to Tameside Victim Support. The only piece returned to a murdered patient's family was a platinum diamond ring, for which the family provided a photograph as proof of ownership. A memorial garden to Shipman's victims, called the Garden of Tranquillity, opened in Hyde Park, Hyde on 30 July 2005. As of early 2009, families of over 200 of the victims of Shipman were still seeking compensation for the loss of their relatives. In September 2009, authorities announced that letters Shipman wrote in prison would be sold at auction, but following complaints from victims' relatives and the media, they withdrew the letters from the sale. =Shipman effect= The Shipman case, and a series of recommendations in the Shipman Inquiry report, led to changes to standard medical procedures in Britain (now referred to as the \\"Shipman effect\\"). Many doctors reported changes in their dispensing practices, and a reluctance to risk over-prescribing pain medication may have led to under-prescribing. Death certification practices were altered as well. Perhaps the largest change was the movement from single-doctor general practices to multiple-doctor general practices. This was not a direct recommendation, but rather because the report stated that there was not enough safeguarding and monitoring of doctors' decisions. The forms needed for a cremation in England and Wales have had their questions altered as a direct result of the Shipman case. For example, the person(s) organising the funeral must answer, \\"Do you know or suspect that the death of the person who has died was violent or unnatural? Do you consider that there should be any further examination of the remains of the person who has died?\\" In media Harold and Fred (They Make Ladies Dead) was a cartoon strip in a 2001 issue of Viz, also featuring serial killer Fred West. Some relatives of Shipman's victims voiced anger at the cartoon. Harold Shipman: Doctor Death, an ITV television dramatisation of the case, was broadcast in 2002; it starred James Bolam in the title role. A documentary also titled Harold Shipman: Doctor Death, with new witness testimony about the serial killer, was shown by ITV as part of its Crime & Punishment strand on 26 April 2018. The programme was criticised as offering \\"little new insight\\". A play titled Beyond Belief ‚Äì Scenes From the Shipman Inquiry, written by Dennis Woolf and directed by Chris Honer was performed at the Library Theatre, Manchester, from 20 October to 22 November 2004. The script of the play comprised edited verbatim extracts from The Shipman Inquiry, spoken by actors playing the witnesses and lawyers at the inquiry. This provided a \\"stark narrative\\" that focused on personal tragedies. The satirical artist Cold War Steve regularly features Harold Shipman in his work. The Shipman Files: A Very British Crime Story a 3 part documentary by Chris Wilson was broadcast on BBC Two, focussed on the victims and how he went undetected for so long.

It also features Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce, Dame May Whitty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel, and Leo G. Carroll. Suspicion is based on Francis Iles's novel Before the Fact (1932). For her role as Lina, Joan Fontaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1941. This is the only Oscar-winning performance in a Hitchcock film. In the film, a shy spinster runs off with a charming playboy, who turns out to be penniless, a gambler, and dishonest in the extreme. She comes to suspect that he is also a murderer, and that he is attempting to kill her. Plot In 1938, handsome, irresponsible playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) meets dowdy Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) on a train in England and charms her into eloping despite the strong disapproval of her wealthy father, General McLaidlaw (Sir Cedric Hardwicke). After a lavish honeymoon and returning to an extravagant house, Lina discovers that Johnnie has no job and no income, habitually lives on borrowed money, and was intending to try to sponge off her father. She talks him into getting a job, and he goes to work for his cousin, estate agent Captain Melbeck (Leo G. Carroll). Gradually, Lina learns that Johnnie has continued to gamble wildly, despite promising to quit, and that to pay a gambling debt, he sold two antique chairs (family heirlooms) that her father had given her as a wedding present. Beaky (Nigel Bruce), Johnnie's good- natured but naive friend, tries to reassure Lina that her husband is a lot of fun and a highly entertaining liar. She repeatedly catches Johnnie in ever more significant lies, discovering that he was fired weeks before for embezzling from Melbeck, who says he will not prosecute if the money is repaid. Lina writes a letter to Johnnie that she is leaving him, but then tears it up. After this, Johnnie enters the room and shows her a telegram announcing her father's death. Johnnie is severely disappointed to discover that Lina has inherited no money, only her father's portrait. He convinces Beaky to finance a hugely speculative land development scheme. Lina is afraid this is a confidence trick or worse, and futilely tries to talk Beaky out of it. Johnnie overhears and angrily warns his wife to stay out of his affairs, but later he calls the whole thing off. When Beaky leaves for Paris, Johnnie accompanies him partway. Later, news reaches Lina that Beaky died in Paris. Johnnie lies to her and an investigating police inspector, saying that he (Johnnie) stayed in London. This and other details lead Lina to suspect he was responsible for Beaky's death. Lina then begins to fear that her husband is plotting to kill her for her life insurance. He has been questioning her friend Isobel Sedbusk (Auriol Lee), a writer of mystery novels, about untraceable poisons. Johnnie brings Lina a glass of milk before bed, but she is too afraid to drink it. Needing to get away for a while, she says she will stay with her mother for a few days. Johnnie insists on driving her there. He speeds recklessly in a powerful convertible on a dangerous road beside a cliff. Lina's door unexpectedly swings open. Johnnie reaches over, his intent unclear to the terrified woman. When she shrinks from him, he stops the car. In the subsequent confrontation, Johnnie asserts that he was actually intending to commit suicide after taking Lina to her mother's. At this time he stated that he has decided that suicide is the coward's way out, and is resolved to face his responsibilities, even to the point of going to prison for the embezzlement. He stated he was in Liverpool at the time of Beaky's death, trying to borrow on Lina's life insurance policy to repay Melbeck. Her suspicions allayed, Lina tells him that they will face the future together. Cast Joan Fontaine and Gary Cooper holding their Oscars at Academy Awards, 1942.

In Suspicion, he can be seen approximately 47 minutes into the film mailing a letter at the village postbox. The West-Ingster screenplay In November 1939, Nathanael West was hired as a screenwriter by RKO Radio Pictures, where he collaborated with Boris Ingster on a film adaptation of the novel. The two men wrote the screenplay in seven weeks, with West focusing on characterization and dialogue as Ingster worked on the narrative structure. When RKO assigned Before the Fact to Hitchcock, he already had his own, substantially different, screenplay, credited to Samson Raphaelson, Joan Harrison, and Alma Reville. (Harrison was Hitchcock's personal assistant, and Reville was Hitchcock's wife.) West and Ingster's screenplay was abandoned and never produced. The text of this screenplay can be found in the Library of America's edition of West's collected works.  Production  =Development= Johnnie and Lina in the film. Suspicion illustrates how a novel's plot can be so much altered in the transition to film as to reverse the author's original intention. As William L. De Andrea states in his Encyclopedia Mysteriosa (1994) that Suspicion > was supposed to be the study of a murder as seen through the eyes of the > eventual victim. However, because Cary Grant was to be the killer and Joan > Fontaine the person killed, the studio ‚Äî RKO ‚Äî decreed a different ending, > which Hitchcock supplied and then spent the rest of his life complaining > about. Hitchcock was quoted as saying that he was forced to alter the ending of the movie. He wanted an ending similar to the climax of the novel, but the studio, more concerned with Cary Grant's \\"heroic\\" image, insisted that it be changed. In his biography of Hitchcock, The Dark Side of Genius, Donald Spoto disputes Hitchcock's claim to have been overruled on the film's ending. Spoto claims that the first RKO treatment and memos between Hitchcock and the studio show that Hitchcock emphatically desired to make a film about a woman's fantasy life. As in the novel, General McLaidlaw opposes his daughter's marriage to Johnnie Aysgarth. In both versions, Johnnie freely admits that he would not mind the general's death because he expects Lina to inherit a substantial fortune, which would solve their financial problems. The book, however, is much darker, with Johnnie egging on the general to exert himself to the point where he collapses and dies. In the film, General McLaidlaw's death is only reported, and Johnnie is not involved at all. Again, Johnnie's criminal record remains incomplete. Several scenes in the film create suspense and sow doubt as to Johnnie's intentions: Beaky's death in Paris is due to an allergy to brandy, which Johnnie knew about. A waiter who barely speaks English tells the police that Beaky addressed his companion that night as \\"Old Bean\\", the way Beaky addressed Johnnie. At the end of the film, Johnnie is driving his wife at breakneck speed to her mother's house. This scene, which takes place after her final illness, is not in the book. The biggest difference is the ending. In Iles' novel, Johnnie serves his sick wife a drink which she knows to be poisoned, and she voluntarily gulps it down. In the film, the drink may or may not be poisoned and can be seen untouched the following morning. Another ending was considered but not used, in which Lina is writing a letter to her mother stating that she fears Johnnie is going to poison her, at which point he walks in with the milk. She finishes the letter, seals and stamps an envelope, asks Johnnie to mail the letter, then drinks the milk. The final shot would have shown him leaving the house and dropping into a mailbox the letter which incriminates him. Hitchcock's recollection of this original ending‚Äîin his book-length interview with Fran√ßois Truffaut, published in English as Hitchcock/Truffaut in 1967‚Äîis that Lina's letter tells her mother she knows that Johnnie is killing her, but that she loves him too much to care. A musical leitmotif is introduced in Suspicion. Whenever Lina is happy with Johnny ‚Äî starting with a ball organised by General McLaidlaw ‚Äî Johann Strauss's waltz \\"Wiener Blut\\" is played in its original, light-hearted version. At one point, when she is suspicious of her husband, a threatening, minor-key version of the waltz is employed, metamorphosing into the full and happy version after the suspense has been lifted. At another, Johnny is whistling the waltz. At yet another, while Johnny is serving the drink of milk, a sad version of \\"Wiener Blut\\" is played again. By placing a lightbulb in the milk, the filmmakers made the contents appear to glow as the glass is carried upstairs by Johnnie, further enhancing the audience's fear that it is poisoned. A visual threat is inserted when Lina suspects her husband of preparing to kill Beaky: On the night before, at the Aysgarths' home, they play Anagrams, and suddenly, by exchanging a letter, Lina has changed \\"mudder\\" into \\"murder\\" and then \\"murderer\\". Seeing the word, Lina imagines the cliffs Johnny and Beaky told her they will inspect for a real estate venture the next morning, and faints. If the viewer accepts Johnnie's statements in the final scene and decides that he is, for all his faults, no murderer, the film becomes a cautionary tale about the dangers of suspicion based only on assumed, incomplete, and circumstantial evidence. However, given his behaviour up to this point, it is not clear why Johnnie's assertions should be readily believed; in effect, the film leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of suspense as to what the truth is and what might happen next. =Casting= Originally, the story was intended as a B picture to star George Sanders and Anne Shirley. Then when Alfred Hitchcock became involved, the budget increased and Laurence Olivier and Frances Dee were to star. Eventually, it was decided to cast Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Fontaine had to be borrowed from David O. Selznick for an expensive fee, because she had been dropped from RKO's contract list a number of years before. Grant and Fontaine had previously worked together in Gunga Din. =Filming= The film was shot entirely on sound stages between February 10 and July 24, 1941. Reception =Box office= According to Variety, the film made $1.8 million at the box office in 1942.\\"101 Pix Gross in Millions\\" Variety 6 Jan 1943 p 58 Suspicion earned a profit of $440,000.Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story.

Scheuer stated in 1941 that the ending being \\"abrupt\\" resulted in it being \\"effective\\". The 2016 article stated that \\"Even today, most aficionados place the film well into the teens when ranking Hitchcock‚Äôs 50-plus films.\\" =Accolades= The film was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as Best Original Score, and Joan Fontaine won for Best Actress. She also won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. The film later won the 1948 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Adaptations During this time, it was common for films to be adapted into radio plays. This film was adapted six times, from 1942 through 1949, starring the original stars and others: Once on Academy Award Theater, twice on Lux Radio Theatre and three times on Screen Guild Theater. Lux Radio Theater presented the initial adaptation on May 4, 1942, with Joan Fontaine, Nigel Bruce, and Brian Aherne in Grant's part. Screen Guild Theater adapted the film on January 4, 1943, with Joan Fontaine and Nigel Bruce reprising their roles while Basil Rathbone assumed Cary Grant's part. Lux aired a remake on October 18, 1944, starring Olivia de Havilland, William Powell and Charles W. Irwin. A few years later, on January 21, 1946, Screen Guild Theater remade it with Cary Grant and Nigel Bruce reprising their parts with Loretta Young. CBS Radio aired an adaptation on October 30, 1946, with Cary Grant and Ann Todd on Academy Award Theater. On November 24, 1949, Screen Guild Theater remade it a third time, featuring all three of the original film stars, Grant, Fontaine and Bruce. The 1988 American Playhouse remake stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Curtin.

Although they were not marketed under this title until the August‚ÄìSeptember 1971 issues of New Gods and Forever People, the terms Fourth World and Jack Kirby's Fourth World have gained usage in the years since. Publication history =Initial 1970s comics= As the newsstand distribution system for comics began to break down, Jack Kirby foresaw a day when comics would need to find alternate venues for sale. Toward this end, Kirby envisioned a finite series that would be serialized and collected in one tome after the series had concluded. He began the \\"Fourth World\\" in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133 (Oct. 1970). DC Comics had planned to introduce the \\"Fourth World\\" titles in the November 1970, issue of their preview omnibus title, Showcase. Kirby reportedly objected to this, and Showcase was cancelled. This delayed the introduction of the \\"Fourth World\\" titles until the following year. The three original titles constituting the \\"Fourth World\\" were The Forever People, Mister Miracle, and The New Gods. Unhappy with Marvel Comics at the time, as he had created or co-created a plethora of characters without having copyright or creative custody of them, he turned to rival publisher DC Comics, with his sketches and designs for a new group of heroes and villains. As author Marc Flores, who writes under the pen name Ronin Ro, described: Mister Miracle #1 (April 1971). Cover art by Jack Kirby and Vince Colletta. \\"The Fourth World\\" dealt with the battle between good and evil as represented by the worlds of New Genesis and Apokolips. Darkseid, the evil lord of Apokolips, seeks the Anti-Life Equation which will allow him to control the thoughts of all living beings. Opposing him is Orion, his son raised by Highfather and his enemies on New Genesis. Other characters caught in the deadly battle included the Forever People, an extension of the kid gang concept from the 1940s with a group of adolescents adventuring without an adult supervisor; Mister Miracle, a native of New Genesis raised on Apokolips who triumphed over a torturous childhood to become the world's greatest escape artist; and Lightray, the heroic warrior of New Genesis. Their adventures would take them to Earth where the war continued. Comics historian Les Daniels observed in 1995 that \\"Kirby's mix of slang and myth, science fiction and the Bible, made for a heady brew, but the scope of his vision has endured.\\" In 2007, comics writer Grant Morrison commented, \\"Kirby's dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm... The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirby's boundless imagination let loose onto paper.\\" The Fourth World characters reappeared in various titles. In 1976, the New Gods were featured in the last issue of 1st Issue Special. The New Gods series relaunched in July 1977, and with 1st Issue Special still a relatively recent publication, it picked up where the storyline of that issue left off. Although the title remained \\"The New Gods\\" in the indicia and retained its original numbering, launching with #12, the covers used the title \\"The Return of the New Gods\\". Gerry Conway wrote the series and Don Newton drew it.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 173: \\"The New Gods series and its original numbering were revived after a five-year break, with a story written by Gerry Conway and drawn by Don Newton.\\" Mister Miracle teamed-up with Batman three times in The Brave and the Bold and the Mister Miracle series was revived in September 1977 by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 175: \\"Writer Steve Englehart and artist Marshall Rogers, having garnered acclaim for Detective Comics, picked up Mister Miracle where the series had ended three years before.\\" Steve Gerber and Michael Golden produced three issues ending with #25 (Sept. 1978) with several storylines unresolved. Mister Miracle teamed with Superman in DC Comics Presents #12 (Aug. 1979) and the New Gods met the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America in Justice League of America #183‚Äì185 (Oct‚ÄìDec 1980). \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\" storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2 featured that team battling Darkseid a thousand years in the future.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan p. 198 \\"When [Paul Levitz] wrote 'The Great Darkness Saga', a five- issue epic that pitted the Legion against one of the most notorious villains of DC's long history, he and artist Keith Giffen crafted the most famous Legion story of all time and became fast fan favorites.\\" =1984 reprint series= In 1984, DC Comics reprinted Jack Kirby's original 11 issues of The New Gods in a six-issue limited series. The first five issues each reprinted two consecutive issues of the original series. The mini-series' final issue was originally intended to include a reprint of New Gods vol. 1 #11 and a new 24-page story which would conclude the series and end with both Darkseid and Orion dead. DC editors prevented Kirby from using his original intended ending. Kirby instead turned in a one-off story called \\"On the Road to Armagetto\\" which was rejected as well, due to the fact that it did not contain a definitive ending to the series. A 48-page new story called \\"Even Gods Must Die\\" was published instead, in the sixth issue of the reprint series, which in turn served as a prologue for the upcoming The Hunger Dogs graphic novel, which DC editors greenlighted in order to conclude the series. The Hunger Dogs was designed to give an ending to the story of the New Gods, while fulfilling editorial mandates that the New Gods be kept alive in order to ensure future use of the characters by later writers. It incorporated several pages from the unpublished \\"On the Road to Armagetto\\" story and brought Kirby's New Gods series to a close as the final battle between Orion and Darkseid is averted when the \\"hunger dogs\\", the tortured citizens of Apokolips, finally overthrow Darkseid and his regime, forcing Darkseid and his allies into exile. =Later revivals= Concurrent with DC's New Gods reprint series in 1984, Kirby worked on two Super Powers comic book limited series for DC Comics in which he continued the Fourth World characters and mythology. A Forever People miniseries was published in 1988. Mister Miracle was featured in Justice League International by J. M. DeMatteis and Keith Giffen and a series of his own written by DeMatteis. The Fourth World characters were prominently featured in Cosmic Odyssey,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 235: \\"Writer Jim Starlin and artist Mike Mignola teamed up for a sci-fi miniseries that spanned the [DC Universe].\\" which led to a third New Gods series (February 1989 ‚Äì August 1991), written by Mark Evanier, which fleshed out details about the history of many New Gods, most notably introducing Darkseid's father Yuga Khan. A fourth New Gods series was launched in October 1995, and a third Mister Miracle series in April 1996. Both of these were replaced in March 1997 by the Jack Kirby's Fourth World series, written and drawn by John Byrne. Walt Simonson wrote and drew an Orion solo series from June 2000 to June 2002.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 296: \\"Comic book legend Walt Simonson brought his unique vision to one of Jack Kirby's greatest heroes on Orion, the first ongoing series to feature the most prominent of the New Gods.\\" Writer Grant Morrison used some of the Fourth World mythology in various titles he worked on, including his run on JLA, with Orion and Big Barda becoming members, and more recently in the Seven Soldiers metaseries, in which the New Gods, especially Mister Miracle, played a major role. They are seen creating Aurakles, the first superhero. The Death of the New Gods limited series (October 2007 ‚Äì April 2008) was written and drawn by Jim Starlin.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 331: \\"Writer and artist Jim Starlin helmed this eight- part series as a mysterious force brought destruction to the inhabitants of the Fourth World.\\" Final Crisis brought about the end of the Fourth World and the dawn of the Fifth as Darkseid was forevermore destroyed and the heroic New Gods (sans Scott Free and Orion) are reborn and made guardians of Earth-51, home of Kamandi and the Great Disaster. With the reboot of the DC Universe following Flashpoint, the deaths of the New Gods and Darkseid have been removed from canon and the characters are still active. In particular, Darkseid and his uncle Steppenwolf and their attacks on the main DC Universe and Earth 2 play a major role in the rise of the superheroes: the Earth 2 versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman die fighting Steppenwolf while the Earth 1 Justice League forms specifically to fight Darkseid and thwart his invasion of Earth. A New 52 version of the Forever People debuted in the Infinity Man and the Forever People series. Serifan is now Serafina, Vykin's sister, and Beautiful Dreamer has been renamed Dreamer Beautiful. Fifth World In December 2007, DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio was discussing the aftermath of Death of the New Gods and pointed to the creation of Fifth World; they said, \\"It's the advent of the Fifth World... I think we've telegraphed so much that the New Gods are coming upon a rebirth, and the story that we‚Äôre telling with them now is a continuation of the story that was established when Kirby first conceived the concept. Talk about death‚ÄîKirby blew up worlds at the start of the series. The story started with, 'The Old Gods Died!' which made room for the New Gods‚Äîwe‚Äôre picking up that thread and launching the DCU into the future.\\" That series led into Final Crisis. DiDio clarified things further, saying \\"the Fourth World is over. The battle between the forces of Darkseid and those of Highfather is over, and a new direction is in place for the characters in what will be deemed the Fifth World.\\" The series' writer, Grant Morrison, added, \\"In Jack Kirby's Fourth World books... it's pretty clear that the New Gods have known about Earth for a long time and in JLA ten years ago, I suggested that part of their interest in us was rooted in the fact that Earth was destined to become the cradle of a new race of 'Fifth World' super-divinities‚Äîan eventuality Darkseid is eager to prevent from occurring.\\" It was during that run on JLA that Morrison had Metron deliver a speech outlining the general principles: Later, in the JLA storyline \\"World War III\\", Metron's dialog is more specific: \\"As New Genesis is to the Fourth World, Earth shall be to the Fifth that is to come.\\" Collected editions =Trade paperbacks= The Kirby-produced \\"Fourth World\\" titles were reprinted by DC in trade paperback format in the early 2000s in black-and-white rather than in color, although the Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen preludes were reprinted in color. *Jack Kirby's New Gods, collects The New Gods #1‚Äì11; 304 pages, December 1997, *Mister Miracle: Jack Kirby's Mister Miracle: Super Escape Artist collects Mr Miracle #1‚Äì10, 256 pages, September 1998, Jack Kirby's Fourth World: Featuring Mister Miracle collects Mister Miracle #11‚Äì18, 187 pages, July 2001, *Jack Kirby's The Forever People collects The Forever People #1‚Äì11, 288 pages, October 1999, *Jimmy Olsen: Adventures by Jack Kirby  Volume 1 collects Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133‚Äì141, 183 pages, July 2003,  Volume 2 collects Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #142‚Äì150, 192 pages, October 2004, =Omnibus= DC reprinted the entire Fourth World saga in publishing order in a four book hardcover collection entitled Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus in 2007‚Äì2008.

In some animals, it is lined with mesothelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated. In the past, and for practical purposes, coelom characteristics have been used to classify bilaterian animal phyla into informal groups.  Etymology  The term \\"coelom\\" derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \\"cavity\\".  Structure  = Development = Coelom is the mesodermally lined cavity between the gut and the outer body wall. During the development of the embryo, coelom formation begins in the gastrulation stage. The developing digestive tube of an embryo forms as a blind pouch called the archenteron. In Protostomes, the coelom forms by a process known as schizocoely. The archenteron initially forms, and the mesoderm splits into two layers: the first attaches to the body wall or ectoderm, forming the parietal layer and the second surrounds the endoderm or alimentary canal forming the visceral layer. The space between the parietal layer and the visceral layer is known as the coelom or body cavity. In Deuterostomes, the coelom forms by enterocoely. The archenteron wall produces buds of mesoderm, and these mesodermal diverticula hollow to become the coelomic cavities. Deuterostomes are therefore known as enterocoelomates. Examples of deuterostome coelomates belong to three major clades: chordates (vertebrates, tunicates, and lancelets), echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers), and hemichordates (acorn worms and graptolites). = Origins = The evolutionary origin of the coelom is uncertain. The oldest known animal to have had a body cavity was the Vernanimalcula. Current hypothesis include: * The acoelomate theory, which states that coelom evolved from an acoelomate ancestor. * The enterocoel theory, which states that coelom evolved from gastric pouches of cnidarian ancestors. This is supported by research on flatworms and small worms recently discovered in marine fauna (\\"coelom\\").  Functions  A coelom can absorb shock or provide a hydrostatic skeleton. It can also support an immune system in the form of coelomocytes that may either be attached to the wall of the coelom or may float about in it freely. The coelom allows muscles to grow independently of the body wall ‚Äî this feature can be seen in the digestive tract of tardigrades (water bears) which is suspended within the body in the mesentery derived from a mesoderm-lined coelom.  Coelomic fluid  The fluid inside the coelom is known as coelomic fluid. This is circulated by mesothelial cilia or by contraction of muscles in the body wall which are themselves of mesin. The coelomic fluid serves several functions: it acts as a hydroskeleton; it allows free movement and growth of internal organs; it serves for transport of gases, nutrients and waste products around the body; it allows storage of sperm and eggs during maturation; and it acts as a reservoir for waste.  Classification in zoology  In the past, some zoologists grouped bilaterian animal phyla based on characteristics related to the coelom for practical purposes, knowing, and explicitly stating, that these groups were not phylogenetically related. Animals were classified in three informal groups according to the type of body cavity they possess, in a non-taxonomic, utilitarian way, as the Acoelomata, Pseudocoelomata, and Coelomata. These groups were never intended to represent related animals, or a sequence of evolutionary traits. However, although this scheme was followed by a number of college textbooks and some general classifications, it is now almost totally abandoned as a formal classification. Indeed, as late as 2010, one author of a molecular phylogeny study mistakenly called this classification scheme the \\"traditional, morphology-based phylogeny\\".Nielsen, C. (2010). \\"The 'new phylogeny'. What is new about it?\\" Palaeodiversity 3, 149‚Äì150. Classification of tripoblasts based on body cavities Coelomate animals or Coelomata (also known as eucoelomates ‚Äì \\"true coelom\\") have a body cavity called a coelom with a complete lining called peritoneum derived from mesoderm (one of the three primary tissue layers). The complete mesoderm lining allows organs to be attached to each other so that they can be suspended in a particular order while still being able to move freely within the cavity. Most bilateral animals, including all the vertebrates, are coelomates. Pseudocoelomate animals have a pseudocoelom (literally \\"false cavity\\"), which is a fluid filled body cavity. Tissue derived from mesoderm partly lines the fluid filled body cavity of these animals. Thus, although organs are held in place loosely, they are not as well organized as in a coelomate. All pseudocoelomates are protostomes; however, not all protostomes are pseudocoelomates. An example of a Pseudocoelomate is the roundworm. Pseudocoelomate animals are also referred to as Blastocoelomate. Acoelomate animals, like flatworms, have no body cavity at all. Semi-solid mesodermal tissues between the gut and body wall hold their organs in place.  Coelomates  Coeloms developed in triploblasts but were subsequently lost in several lineages. The lack of a coelom is correlated with a reduction in body size. Coelom is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to any developed digestive tract. Some organisms may not possess a coelom or may have a false coelom (pseudocoelom). Animals having coeloms are called coelomates, and those without are called acoelomates. There are also subtypes of coelom: * schizocoelom: develops from split in mesoderm found in annelids, arthropods and molluscs * haemocoelom: true coelom reduced and cavity filled with blood found from arthropoda to mollusca * enterocoelom: develops from wall of embryonic gut found from echinodermata to chordata = Coelomate phyla = According to Brusca and Brusca,R. C. Brusca, G. J. Brusca. Invertebrates. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, 2003 (2nd ed.), p. 47, . the following bilaterian phyla possess a coelom: * Nemertea, traditionally viewed as acoelomates * Priapulida * Annelida * Onychophora * Tardigrada * Arthropoda * Mollusca * Phoronida * Ectoprocta * Brachiopoda * Echinodermata * Chaetognatha * Hemichordata * Chordata For others, the coelomate phyla excludes Nemertea but also comprises Entoprocta, Pentastoma, Pogonophora (i.e., from tiny sessile aquatic animals to great whales and everything in between).  Pseudocoelomates  In some protostomes, the embryonic blastocoele persists as a body cavity. These protostomes have a fluid filled main body cavity unlined or partially lined with tissue derived from mesoderm. This fluid-filled space surrounding the internal organs serves several functions like distribution of nutrients and removal of waste or supporting the body as a hydrostatic skeleton. A pseudocoelomate or blastocoelomate is any invertebrate animal with a three-layered body and a pseudocoel. The coelom was apparently lost or reduced as a result of mutations in certain types of genes that affected early development. Thus, pseudocoelomates evolved from coelomates.Evers, Christine A., Lisa Starr. Biology:Concepts and Applications. 6th ed. United States:Thomson, 2006. . \\"Pseudocoelomate\\" is no longer considered a valid taxonomic group, since it is not monophyletic. However, it is still used as a descriptive term. Important characteristics: * lack a vascular blood system  diffusion and osmosis circulate nutrients and waste products throughout the body. * lack a skeleton  hydrostatic pressure gives the body a supportive framework that acts as a skeleton. * no segmentation * body wall  epidermis and muscle  often syncytial  usually covered by a secreted cuticle * most are microscopic * parasites of almost every form of life (although some are free living) * eutely in some * loss of larval stage in some * possibly pedomorphism = Pseudocoelomate phyla = According to Brusca and Brusca, bilaterian pseudocoelomate phyla include: * Rotifera * Kinorhyncha * Nematoda * Nematomorpha * Acanthocephala * Loricifera Some authors list the following phyla as pseudocoelomates: Ecdysozoans pseudocoelomates * Nematoda (roundworms) * Nematomorpha (nematomorphs or horsehair worms) * Loricifera * Priapulida * Kinorhyncha Lophotrochozoans pseudocoelomates * Gastrotricha * Entoprocta * Rotifera (rotifers) * Acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms)  Acoelomates  Acoelomates lack a fluid-filled body cavity between the body wall and digestive tract. This can cause some serious disadvantages. Fluid compression is negligible, while the tissue surrounding the organs of these animals will compress. Therefore, acoelomate organs are not protected from crushing forces applied to the animal‚Äôs outer surface. The coelom can be used for diffusion of gases and metabolites etc. These creatures do not have this need, as the surface area to volume ratio is large enough to allow absorption of nutrients and gas exchange by diffusion alone, due to dorso-ventral flattening. * Platyhelminthes * Gastrotricha, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates * Entoprocta, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates * Gnathostomulida, traditionally viewed as blastocoelomates * CycliophoraR.C.Brusca, G.J.Brusca 2003, p. 379. According to others, acoelomates include the cnidarians (jellyfish and allies), and the ctenophores (comb jellies), platyhelminthes (flatworms including tapeworms, etc.), Nemertea, and Gastrotricha.

The \\"Duchy of Z√§hringen\\" () by definition consisted of the territories and fiefs held by the Z√§hringer, and it was not seen as a duchy in equal standing with the old stem duchies. The Z√§hringer attempted to expand their territories in Swabia and Burgundy into a fully recognized duchy, but their expansion was halted in the 1130s due to their feud with the Welfs. They were granted the special title of Rector of Burgundy in 1127, and they continued to use both titles until their extinction in 1218. Pursuing their territorial ambitions, they founded numerous cities and monasteries, on either side of the Black Forest as well as in the western Swiss plateau. After their extinction, parts of their territories reverted to the crown (attained imperial immediacy), other parts were divided between the houses of Kyburg, Urach and F√ºrstenberg. The title of \\"Duke of Z√§hringen\\" was revived in the 19th century by the House of Baden, which shares descent from Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia with the House of Z√§hringen. History Z√§hringen castle, c. 1500 The earliest known ancestor of the family was one Berthold, Count in the Breisgau (d. 982), who was first mentioned in 962. In view of his name, he may have been related to the Alemannic Ahalolfing dynasty. Berthold's great-grandson, the later Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia (posthumously known as Berthold I of Z√§hringen, c. 1000‚Äì1078), held several lordships (Herrschaften) in the Breisgau, in Thurgau, Ortenau, and Baar. By his mother, he was related to the rising Hohenstaufen family. Emperor Henry III had promised his vassal Berthold the Duchy of Swabia, but this was not fulfilled, as upon Henry's death, his widow Agnes of Poitou appointed Count Rudolf of Rheinfelden to the position of Duke of Swabia in 1057. In compensation, Berthold was made Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona in 1061. However, this dignity was only a titular one, and Berthold subsequently lost it when, in the course of the Investiture Controversy, he joined the rising of his former rival Rudolf of Rheinfelden against German king Henry IV in 1073. Berthold's son Berthold II (c. 1050-1111), who like his father fought against Henry IV, inherited a lot of the lands of Rudolf's son Count Berthold of Rheinfelden in 1090 (though not his comital title, which stayed with the family von Wetter-Rheinfelden). Berthold II is so named both as Duke of Swabia (following Berthold of Rheinfelden, the first duke of Swabia of this name) and as head of the House of Z√§hringen (following his father, who is counted as Berthold I of Z√§hringer in spite of not historically having used the name Z√§hringen). Berthold II did use the \\"Z√§hringen\\" name, although he moved his main residence from Z√§hringen Castle to the newly built Freiburg Castle in 1091. In 1092, Berthold II was elected Duke of Swabia against Frederick I of Hohenstaufen. In 1098, he reconciled with Frederick, renounced all claims to Swabia and instead concentrated on his possessions in the Breisgau region, assuming the title of Duke of Z√§hringen. He was succeeded in turn by his sons, Berthold III (d. 1122) and Conrad (d. 1152). In 1127, upon the assassination of his nephew Count William III, Conrad claimed the inheritance of the County of Burgundy against Count Renaud III of M√¢con. Renaud prevailed, though he had to cede large parts of the eastern Transjuranian lands to Conrad, who thereupon was appointed by Emperor Lothair III as a \\"rector\\" of the Imperial Kingdom of Arles or Burgundy. This office was confirmed in 1152 and held by the Z√§hringen dukes until 1218, hence they are sometimes called \\"Dukes of Burgundy\\", although the existing Duchy of Burgundy was not an Imperial but a French fief. Duke Berthold IV (d. 1186), who followed his father Conrad and founded the Swiss city of Fryburg (today's Fribourg-Freiburg) in 1157, spent much of his time in Italy in the train of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. His son and successor, Berthold V, showed his prowess by reducing the Burgundian nobles to order. This latter duke was the founder of the city of Bern (1191), and when he died in February 1218, the ducal line of the Z√§hringen family became extinct. Among other titles, the Z√§hringen family acted as Reichsvogt of the Z√ºrichgau area. After the extinction of the ducal line in 1218, much of their extensive territory in the Breisgau and modern-day Switzerland returned to the crown, except for their allodial titles, which were divided between the counts of Urach (who subsequent called themselves the Counts of Freiburg) and the counts of Kyburg, both descended from the sisters of Berthold V. Less than fifty years later, the Kyburgs died out and large portions of their domains were inherited by the House of Habsburg. Bern achieved the status of a free imperial city, whereas other cities such as Fribourg-Freiburg only obtained the same status later in history. Possessions and territories Territories of the dominant noble houses in Swabia and Upper Burgundy around 1200; Z√§hringen possessions shown in green Berthold I (ancestor of both the House of Z√§hringen and the House of Baden) held the comital titles of Breisgau, Thurgau, as well as being reeve in Stein am Rhein (owned by the bishop of Bamberg). The county of Thurgau was lost in c. 1077. Berthold II, founder of the House of Z√§hringen proper, in 1098 received Z√§hringen castle and the jurisdiction over Z√ºrich (alongside the Counts of Lenzburg until 1173). Ownership of the county of Rheinfelden and of Burgdorf also dates to c. 1198. The \\"rectorate\\" of the county of Burgundy was granted in 1127 (inheritance of Otto-William, Count of Burgundy). Ownership of Burgundy was contested, and Z√§hringer de facto rule was limited to the parts of Upper Burgundy east of the Jura and north of Lake Geneva. The territories south of Lake Geneva were conceded to the Savoy and Provence in 1156. In compensation, Berthold IV received the investiture right for the bishops of Geneva, Sion and Lausanne, de facto realised only in the case of Lausanne. The extinction of the counts of Lenzburg in 1173 strengthened the Z√§hringer position south of the Rhine, but their territorial expansion was halted following their support of the Welfs in the unsuccessful feud against Conrad III of Germany during 1138‚Äì1152, and frustrated their ambitions to carve out a contiguous territorial duchy wedged between Swabia and Burgundy, in spite of late attempts on the part of Berthold V to increase his territorial sway (who as late as 1210 aimed at receiving the jurisdiction over St. Gallen). Instead of territorial expansion, the dukes of Z√§hringen from the 1150s focussed on attaining more immediate feudal control over the territories they already had. This included their policy of expanding settlements into fortified towns or cities and the construction of new castles, mostly in their territories north of the rhine, while their encroachment on the rights of the comital nobility south of the Rhine seems to have been resisted, mostly passively but in the case of the lords of Gl√¢ne and Thun in an open revolt in 1191. The fragmentation of the Z√§hringer possessions after 1218 was an important factor in the communal movements of the late medieval period in the region, including the imperial immediacy of Bern and Z√ºrich, and the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century. =Cities= Berthold V, shown on the Z√§hringer monument in Bern, Switzerland Among the cities founded or expanded by the Z√§hringer dukes () are: *in Swabia, west of the Black Forest (Baden): Freiburg im Breisgau (1120), Offenburg (before 1148), Neuenburg am Rhein (1175); *in Swabia, east of the Black Forest (W√ºrttemberg): Sankt Peter (1093), Villingen (1119), Br√§unlingen (c. 1200), Weilheim an der Teck (Limburg castle c. 1060); *in Burgundy (western Swiss plateau): on the Rhine: Rheinfelden (c. 1150); Aare basin: Fribourg (Freiburg im √úechtland, 1157) Bern (1191), Burgdorf (castle before 1175), Murten (c. 1180), Thun (c. 1190). Other towns owned by or under the jurisdiction (Reichsvogtei) of the Z√§hringer include: Solothurn (acquired 1127), Z√ºrich (acquired 1173), Schaffhausen (acquired 1198), Stein am Rhein. The city of Morges on Lake Geneva is not a Z√§hringer foundation (having been founded in 1286 by Louis I of Vaud) but shared the characteristic layout of the Z√§hringer cities. Genealogy Z√§hringen attributed arms in a stained glass window by Hans Reichle (c. 1570-1642) in Freiburg town hall. There are two traditions of attributed arms, either or an eagle displayed gules (shown here) or gules a lion rampant or, based on the respective coats of arms used in the later medieval period by the counts of Freiburg who claimed the Z√§hringer inheritance (the houses of F√ºrstenberg and Sch√∂nborn).August Freiherr von Berstett, M√ºnzgeschichte des Z√§hringen-Badischen F√ºrstenhauses (1846), p. 3. =House of Z√§hringen= Equestrian seal of Berthold V, dated 1187.The shield with heraldic eagle visible in this seal (from a document at Fraum√ºnster, Z√ºrich, dated 1187) is the only contemporary attestation of a Z√§hringer coat of arms. Franz Zell, Geschichte und Beschreibung des Badischen Wappens von seiner Entstehung bis auf seine heutige Form (1858), p. 7 and plate I. Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia, Margrave of Verona (c. 1000‚Äì1078, r. 1061-1077) is also known as \\"Berthold I of Z√§hringen\\", and therefore the succession of dukes of Z√§hringen begins with his son as Berthold II: Dukes of Z√§hringen: *Berthold II (c. 1050‚Äì1111), Duke of Swabia from 1092 to 1098 (against Frederick I of Hohenstaufen), then Duke of Z√§hringen from about 1100. The numeral II carried by Berthold refers to both the House of Z√§hringen (succeeding his father Berthold I) and the Duchy of Swabia (succeeding Berthold I, Duke of Swabia of the House of Rheinfelden). *Berthold III (c. 1085‚Äì1122), son, Duke of Z√§hringen from 1111 *Conrad I (c. 1090‚Äì1152), brother, Duke of Z√§hringen from 1122, rector of Burgundy from 1127 *Berthold IV (c. 1125‚Äì1186), son, Duke of Z√§hringen from 1152, rector of Burgundy *Berthold V (1160‚Äì1218), son, Duke of Z√§hringen from 1186, rector of Burgundy Other notable Z√§hringer: *Gebhard of Z√§hringen (d. 1110), son of Berthold I, became Bishop of Constance *Clementia of Z√§hringen (d. 1175), daughter of Conrad I, married Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony in 1147 *Rudolf of Z√§hringen (d. 1191), son of Conrad I, became Archbishop of Mainz and Bishop of Li√®ge = House of Baden = The Veronese margravial title was used by Herman I of Baden, the eldest son of Berthold I of Z√§hringen. Herman's son, Herman II, was the first to use the title of Margrave of Baden in 1112. Now more commonly known as the House of Baden, Herman's descendants ruled successively as margraves until the Final Recess of 1803, as Electors of the Electorate of Baden until 1806, then as Grand Dukes of Baden until the end of the German monarchy in 1918. The current holder of the title of \\"Margrave of Baden, Duke of Z√§hringen\\" is Maximilian, Margrave of Baden (b. 1933), a grandson of the last chancellor of the German Empire (Prince Max von Baden), who seems to have revived the Z√§hringen title after it apparently had not been in official usage since the death of Berthold V(1160-1218). Another branch was that of the Dukes of Teck, descendants of Duke Conrad's son Adalbert, whose line became extinct in 1439. = Dukes of Teck = Seal of Adalbert I, Duke of Teck (c. 1190) Adalbert I (d. 1195) was a son of Duke Conrad I of Z√§hringen, and upon the death of his brother Berthold IV in 1186, he inherited the family estates around Teck Castle and, from 1187, adopted the title of Duke of Teck. His descendant Conrad II of Teck (1235‚Äì1292) allegedly was designated King of the Romans shortly before his assassination. The line became extinct in 1439 with the death of Louis of Teck, Patriarch of Aquileia. This ducal title was later granted to Count Francis of Hohenstein (1837‚Äì1900), a morganatic son of Duke Alexander of W√ºrttemberg, in 1871. Francis' daughter Mary of Teck (1867‚Äì1953), as the wife of King George V, was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Empress of India.

Life  =Early years= Tapio Rautavaara was born in the municipality of Pirkkala (now Nokia), a suburb of the industrial city of Tampere, as the son of Henrik Kerttula and Hilda Rautavaara. Just three weeks later, his mother moved to the Helsinki suburb of Oulunkyl√§, where she had lived before. Rautavaara's father was rarely at home, and soon left the family permanently. In 1921, Tapio and his mother moved to Tampere. Rautavaara used to have conflicts with his conservative teachers due to his working-class background. Tapio earned pocket money by selling socialist papers for local workers of the Finlayson textile factory. Four years later, the family returned Oulunkyl√§, where Rautavaara lived the rest of his life. In the late 1920s, Rautavaara joined the local working-class sports club Oulunkyl√§n T√§hti (‚Ä≥Oulunkyl√§ Star‚Ä≥) for practicing athletics. Rautavaara's formal education ended at the elementary level. By the outbreak of the Finnish Winter War in 1939, he had worked as a newspaper boy, roadworker, lumberjack and as a storeman at a co-operative mill. His national military service was with the Finnish Navy in the mid 1930s. =War time= When the Winter War broke out the Navy was not very active in the war and Rautavaara was allowed to continue working at the Osuustukkukauppa (OTK) mill. However, when the Continuation War broke out he was called to the army and he was ordered to be the first year of the war in the front line. In the summer of 1942, Rautavaara was transferred to the war entertainment troops and worked for two years as a radio journalist on the frontier based Aunus Radio. During this time he became known to the troops. In the summer of 1944 the Finns had to pull out from East Karelia and Rautavaara's radio career ended. =Sports career= Kuuno Honkonen, Tapio Rautavaara, Pentti Siltaloppi and Salomon K√∂n√∂nen at the 1948 Olympics Rautavaara in 1949 Rautavaara was a talented javelin thrower and archer. In 1937, he represented the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation at the Workers' Olympiads in Antwerp, finishing second in the javelin throw after his countrymen Erkki Autonen. After the World War II, Rautavaara won a European bronze medal in 1946, an Olympic gold medal in 1948, and five national titles in 1944‚Äì45, and 1947‚Äì49. He placed fifth at the 1950 European Championships. In archery Rautavaara won a team gold medal at the 1958 World Championships and a national title in 1955. =Music and acting career= After the war Rautavaara met Reino Helismaa, who composed and made the lyrics to Reissumies ja kissa (The Traveler and the Cat), which became Rautavaara's first hit. Composer Toivo K√§rki joined this team, which produced over the next ten years many popular songs. In addition, Rautavaara composed and wrote the lyrics for many of his records. Rautavaara received gold records for the songs Isois√§n olkihattu (Grandpa's Strawhat), Vain merimies voi tiet√§√§ (Only a Sailor Could Know) and H√§√§valssi (The Wedding Waltz). The first song was written and composed by Rautavaara, the second one was composed by him and the lyrics were written by Heikki Saari. Rautavaara, Helismaa and Esa Pakarinen toured Finland together at the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. The touring stopped due to personal problems, but Rautavaara continued to record songs with Helismaa's lyrics until Helismaa's death in 1965. By the time of his death in 1979 Rautavaara had recorded about 300 songs. Rautavaara became one of the most beloved singers in Finland. Some of his famous songs include Isois√§n olkihattu (Grandfather's Straw Hat), Reppu ja reissumies (The Backpack and the Traveler), Korttipakka (The Deck of Cards), Lapin jenkka (The Lappland Schottische), Juokse sin√§ humma (Run, Horse, Run), Kulkuri ja joutsen (The Tramp and the Swan), Tuopin j√§ljet (Marks of the Tankard), Sininen uni (Blue Dream) and Anttilan kev√§thuumaus (Anttila's Spring Fever). Rautavaara was cast as the protagonist in numerous Finnish films, and was also supposedly a candidate for the part of Tarzan after Johnny Weissmuller had quit his career. = Later years = The peak of Rautavaara's popularity was in the 1950s, stretching into the early years of the 1960s. After that, his music was left in the shadow of rautalanka and tango music and the popularity of the television. He continued to perform regularly, however, right up until his death, even though his gigs in the 1970s were for smaller audiences, such as in department stores and topping out ceremonies. Death and tributes On September 25, 1979 Tapio Rautavaara had been at the Tikkurila Swimming Center in Vantaa taking photographs for the book Kultaa, kunniaa, kyyneleit√§ (Finnish for \\"Gold, glory, tears\\") along with photographer Pentti Pekkala. After he had gone to the sauna, Rautavaara slipped and hit his head on the floor. He was taken to a nearby health center, where his injuries were not taken seriously, as staff believed him to be drunk. His head was bandaged and he was sent home. His wife and daughters laid him on a mattress on the floor of his office room at his home in Oulunkyl√§ to sleep. The next night, he died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. His wife told their daughter that he had gone. When the daughter asked where to, her mother replied \\"No, he's dead.\\"Hopi, Anna: Iskelm√§legenda Tapio Rautavaaran tyt√§r muistelee is√§ns√§ traagista kuolemaa: \\"Laitoimme h√§net nukkumaan ty√∂huoneen lattialle\\", Iltalehti 20 June 2020. Accessed on 20 June 2020. Rautavaara was buried in Malmi, Helsinki. =Memorial= A memorial by Veikko Myller entitled Kulkurin uni (\\"A Vagabond's Dream\\") to the memory of Rautavaara is located in the market square in central Oulunkyl√§, the district of Helsinki, where Rautavaara lived most of his life. =TV documentary and film= Peter von Bagh created a TV documentary on Rautavaara entitled Tapsa at the time of Rautavaara's death in 1979. Timo Koivusalo used Rautavaara's and Helismaa's tours as the basis for his film Kulkuri ja joutsen in 1999. =Play= In spring 2007 the Nokia Workers' theatre presented a play entitled Sininen uni (The Blue Dream), which was based on his life. Rautavaara's influence on later groups Ville Valo, the frontman of the Finnish rock band HIM, regards Rautavaara as his greatest idol in Finnish music.

An expansion bus is a computer bus which moves information between the internal hardware of a computer system (including the CPU and RAM) and peripheral devices. It is a collection of wires, connectors, form factors and protocols that allows for the expansion of a computer. In the simplest example, an expansion bus can be as simple as a ribbon cable that hangs out of the system unit which imposes no form factor constraints on the circuitry added, other than a maximum wire length for a given frequency of intended operation. Note that the function of a wire is either power delivery or signalling, both of which can become exceedingly complex in the frequency domain. Below around 8 MHz wires can often be treated as DC elements, above 30 MHz wires on this length scale must be treated as transmission lines; in between a designer might get away with treating wires as DC elements if the ground plane is handled carefully and the wires are short. Hobby electronics rarely exceeds a 10 MHz signalling rate on parallel interconnects. Once the signalling frequency passes into the transmission line regime, form factor constraints become arduous and expansion cards will typically feature standardized connectors with tight manufacturing tolerances, and the expansion card itself will likely interface to the bus through a dedicated interface chip designed to respect the narrow bus tolerances for timing and signal integrity. It will no longer be possible to prototype with breadboards or wire-wrapping, and the design must go straight to PCB, which are costly to fabricate in small volumes. In this regime, the expansion bus and the expansion card become largely synonymous. Additionally, with high- speed electronics the electrical enclosure becomes important to shield the expansion card from electromagnetic interference and to comply with regulations on radiated emissions. Electrical enclosures, such as computer cases, are typically designed to accept expansion cards of predetermined dimensions, with standardized interconnects. Usually the chassis will provide an edge connector socket, and the expansion card PCB with expose a row of conductive fingers (typically double-sided) that seats securely into the connector. Most enclosures specify power consumption and cooling limits on the expansion card design. In modern computers, expansion cards are complex system elements constrained by a wide variety of complex design factors. For compatibility reasons, expansion cards will often have a keying system which prevents cards from being inserted into inappropriate sockets (such as the wrong voltage of operation, which could damage one or both sides). For this reason, it often takes close inspection of a socket to determine what form factors are compatible. In some cases, a socket can accept a card with less than the exposed connection points, usually to operate at lower performance than the socket otherwise supports; it's not uncommon in this scenario that the socket is divided into a pair of two (rarely more than two) colinear sockets, where a short card will connect with the first socket only, but a long card will connect with both. In personal computing, notable expansion buses and expansion card standards include the S-100 bus from 1974 associated with the CP/M operating system, the 50-pin expansion slots of the original Apple II computer from 1977 (unique to Apple), IBM's Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) introduced with the IBM PC in 1981, Acorn's tube expansion bus on the BBC Micro also from 1981, IBM's patented and proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) from 1987 that never won favour in the clone market, the vastly improved Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) that displaced ISA in 1992, and PCI Express from 2003 which abstracts the interconnect into high-speed communication \\"lanes\\" and relegates all other functions into software protocol. From the perspective of electrical design, in the early years of the microprocessor revolution, chip packaging costs were high. The Motorola 68000 from 1979 innovated a 64-pin DIP in plastic when 40-pin DIPs were still the norm, which became nicknamed the \\"Texas cockroach\\" by those involved because every possible deformity and defect was observed in early efforts (at that time, a 64-pin DIP in a proven ceramic package might cost USD $25 for the package alone). Under these constraints, a direct and cost effective way to implement a performant expansion bus was to bridge the CPU's existing memory interface to handle peripheral devices. The S-100, Apple II, ISA, and Acorn Tube were all developed within this model. The would usually open the entire contents of system memory to any expansion card present. There was usually no security model or access constraints. This ethos continued into the design of interface standards such as IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire) which remain subject to what is now known as a DMA attack. Unless the expansion card was dedicated to output only, the card would need a mechanism to alert the main CPU of an asynchronous event to be processed. If the time constraints were mild, this might be implemented on the cheap by having the main CPU perform periodic polling (generally considered inefficient), but otherwise the expansion card would implement an interrupt line dedicated to signalling an asynchronous event. However, it was common bus design practice to share a small number of distinct interrupt lines over a larger number of expansion slots (in particular the ISA bus) and this created many resource conflicts. Sometimes this could be resolved by manually tying the expansion card to a desired IRQ line. This could be accomplished with jumper blocks, DIP switches, or in later generations, by electrically programming an on-board configuration EEPROM. Because expansion cards are typically mapped onto the main system bus, cards are commonly memory mapped. It is possible to design expansion slots so that each slot has a dedicated block of memory addresses for communication with the main processor. But for cost reasons, expansion buses were usually designed so that every slot was identical, and it was left to the user to select/configure devices which presently themselves in unique address blocks. This proved especially prone to conflict when a user wished to expand a system with multiple instances of the same expansion card, such as a large number of serial ports to implement a bulletin board system. In the home setting, unsophisticated users invariably demanded auto-detection of newly inserted hardware cards, lacking the technical knowledge to take detailed configuration into their own hands. Many operating systems conduct a series of probes during the boot process to detect known devices by some observable electronic signature (e.g. responding to an I/O address where such a device is traditionally addressed). Microsoft's plug and play standard from 1995 was an extreme example of this practice (widely derided as \\"plug and pray\\" during its long teething stage where it seemed to actively interfere with manual efforts to correct its many mistakes). From the earliest era, expansion cards often contained an option ROM where the expansion card would supply its own initialization firmware and sometimes its own device driver as well. This tended to simplify device enumeration. Especially disk controller expansion cards tended to implement complex options ROMs, because until the disk controller functioned, the host computer would not be able to connect to disk storage to complete its own boot function. If for some reason the option ROM proved incompatible with the BIOS of the host system, such a problem was generally impossible to resolve without a firmware upgrade on one side or the other; a failed firmware upgrade could turn the target device into a brick in short order, so firmware upgrades were generally regarded as a last resort. History Even vacuum-tube based computers had modular construction, but individual functions for peripheral devices filled a cabinet, not just a printed circuit board. Processor, memory and I/O cards became feasible with the development of integrated circuits. Expansion cards allowed a processor system to be adapted to the needs of the user, allowing variations in the type of devices connected, additions to memory, or optional features to the central processor (such as a floating point unit). Minicomputers, starting with the PDP-8, were made of multiple cards, all powered by and communicating through a passive backplane. The first commercial microcomputer to feature expansion slots was the Micral N, in 1973. The first company to establish a de facto standard was Altair with the Altair 8800, developed 1974‚Äì1975, which later became a multi-manufacturer standard, the S-100 bus. Many of these computers were also passive backplane designs, where all elements of the computer, (processor, memory, and I/O) plugged into a card cage which passively distributed signals and power between the cards. Proprietary bus implementations for systems such as the Apple II co-existed with multi-manufacturer standards. =IBM PC and descendants= IBM introduced what would retroactively be called the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus with the IBM PC in 1981. At that time, the technology was called the PC bus. The IBM XT, introduced in 1983, used the same bus (with slight exception). The 8-bit PC and XT bus was extended with the introduction of the IBM AT in 1984. This used a second connector for extending the address and data bus over the XT, but was backward compatible; 8-bit cards were still usable in the AT 16-bit slots. Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) became the designation for the IBM AT bus after other types were developed. Users of the ISA bus had to have in-depth knowledge of the hardware they were adding to properly connect the devices, since memory addresses, I/O port addresses, and DMA channels had to be configured by switches or jumpers on the card to match the settings in driver software. IBM's MCA bus, developed for the PS/2 in 1987, was a competitor to ISA, also their design, but fell out of favor due to the ISA's industry-wide acceptance and IBM's licensing of MCA. EISA, the 32-bit extended version of ISA championed by Compaq, was used on some PC motherboards until 1997, when Microsoft declared it a \\"legacy\\" subsystem in the PC 97 industry white-paper. Proprietary local buses (q.v. Compaq) and then the VESA Local Bus Standard, were late 1980s expansion buses that were tied but not exclusive to the 80386 and 80486 CPU bus. The PC/104 bus is an embedded bus that copies the ISA bus. Intel launched their PCI bus chipsets along with the P5-based Pentium CPUs in 1993. The PCI bus was introduced in 1991 as a replacement for ISA. The standard (now at version 3.0) is found on PC motherboards to this day. The PCI standard supports bus bridging: as many as ten daisy chained PCI buses have been tested. Cardbus, using the PCMCIA connector, is a PCI format that attaches peripherals to the Host PCI Bus via PCI to PCI Bridge. Cardbus is being supplanted by ExpressCard format. Intel introduced the AGP bus in 1997 as a dedicated video acceleration solution. AGP devices are logically attached to the PCI bus over a PCI-to-PCI bridge. Though termed a bus, AGP usually supports only a single card at a time (Legacy BIOS support issues). From 2005 PCI-Express has been replacing both PCI and AGP. This standard, approved in 2004, implements the logical PCI protocol over a serial communication interface. PC/104(-Plus) or Mini PCI are often added for expansion on small form factor boards such as Mini-ITX. For their 1000 EX and 1000 HX models, Tandy Computer designed the PLUS expansion interface, an adaptation of the XT-bus supporting cards of a smaller form factor. Because it is electrically compatible with the XT bus (a.k.a. 8-bit ISA or XT-ISA), a passive adapter can be made to connect XT cards to a PLUS expansion connector. Another feature of PLUS cards is that they are stackable. Another bus that offered stackable expansion modules was the \\"sidecar\\" bus used by the IBM PCjr. This may have been electrically comparable to the XT bus; it most certainly had some similarities since both essentially exposed the 8088 CPU's address and data buses, with some buffering and latching, the addition of interrupts and DMA provided by Intel add-on chips, and a few system fault detection lines (Power Good, Memory Check, I/O Channel Check). Again, PCjr sidecars are not technically expansion cards, but expansion modules, with the only difference being that the sidecar is an expansion card enclosed in a plastic box (with holes exposing the connectors). =Other families= Most other computer lines, including those from Apple Inc. (Apple II, Macintosh), Tandy, Commodore, Amiga, and Atari, offered their own expansion buses. The Amiga used Zorro II. Apple used a proprietary system with seven 50-pin-slots for Apple II peripheral cards, then later used the NuBus for its Macintosh series until 1995, when they switched to a PCI Bus. Generally, PCI expansion cards will function on any CPU platform if there is a software driver for that type. PCI video cards and other cards that contain a BIOS are problematic, although video cards conforming to VESA Standards may be used for secondary monitors. DEC Alpha, IBM PowerPC, and NEC MIPS workstations used PCI bus connectors. Both Zorro II and NuBus were plug and play, requiring no hardware configuration by the user. Even many video game consoles, such as the Sega Genesis, included expansion buses; at least in the case of the Genesis, the expansion bus was proprietary, and in fact the cartridge slots of many cartridge based consoles (not including the Atari 2600) would qualify as expansion buses, as they exposed both read and write capabilities of the system's internal bus. However, the expansion modules attached to these interfaces, though functionally the same as expansion cards, are not technically expansion cards, due to their physical form. Other computer buses were used for industrial control, instruments, and scientific systems. Some of these standards were VMEbus, STD Bus, and others. =External expansion buses= Laptops generally are unable to accept most expansion cards. Several compact expansion standards were developed. The original PC Card expansion card standard is essentially a compact version of the ISA bus. The CardBus expansion card standard is an evolution of the PC card standard to make it into a compact version of the PCI bus. The original ExpressCard standard acts like it is either a USB 2.0 peripheral or a PCI Express 1.x x1 device. ExpressCard 2.0 adds SuperSpeed USB as another type of interface the card can use. Unfortunately, CardBus and ExpressCard are vulnerable to DMA attack unless the laptop has an IOMMU that is configured to thwart these attacks. Applications The primary purpose of an expansion card is to provide or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. For example, the original IBM PC did not have on-board graphics or hard drive capability. In that case, a graphics card and an ST-506 hard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface respectively. Some single-board computers made no provision for expansion cards, and may only have provided IC sockets on the board for limited changes or customization. Since reliable multi-pin connectors are relatively costly, some mass-market systems such as home computers had no expansion slots and instead used a card-edge connector at the edge of the main board, putting the costly matching socket into the cost of the peripheral device. In the case of expansion of on-board capability, a motherboard may provide a single serial RS232 port or Ethernet port. An expansion card can be installed to offer multiple RS232 ports or multiple and higher bandwidth Ethernet ports. In this case, the motherboard provides basic functionality but the expansion card offers additional or enhanced ports. Physical construction One edge of the expansion card holds the contacts (the edge connector or pin header) that fit into the slot. They establish the electrical contact between the electronics on the card and on the motherboard. Peripheral expansion cards generally have connectors for external cables. In the PC-compatible personal computer, these connectors were located in the support bracket at the back of the cabinet. Industrial backplane systems had connectors mounted on the top edge of the card, opposite to the backplane pins. Depending on the form factor of the motherboard and case, around one to seven expansion cards can be added to a computer system. 19 or more expansion cards can be installed in backplane systems. When many expansion cards are added to a system, total power consumption and heat dissipation become limiting factors. Some expansion cards take up more than one slot space. For example, many graphics cards on the market as of 2010 are dual slot graphics cards, using the second slot as a place to put an active heat sink with a fan. Some cards are \\"low-profile\\" cards, meaning that they are shorter than standard cards and will fit in a lower height computer chassis. (There is a \\"low profile PCI card\\" standard that specifies a much smaller bracket and board area). The group of expansion cards that are used for external connectivity, such as network, SAN or modem cards, are commonly referred to as input/output cards (or I/O cards). Daughterboard A sound card with a MIDI daughterboard attachedA daughterboard for Inventec server platform that acts as a RAID controller based on LSI 1078 chipset A daughterboard, daughtercard, mezzanine board or piggyback board is an expansion card that attaches to a system directly. IEEE Std. 100 Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition, IEEE, 2000,, page 284 Daughterboards often have plugs, sockets, pins or other attachments for other boards. Daughterboards often have only internal connections within a computer or other electronic devices, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a computer bus. Daughterboards are sometimes used in computers in order to allow for expansion cards to fit parallel to the motherboard, usually to maintain a small form factor. This form are also called riser cards, or risers. Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device, such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model. Rather than redesigning the first model completely, a daughterboard may be added to a special connector on the main board. These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board, separated by spacers or standoffs, and are sometimes called mezzanine cards due to being stacked like the mezzanine of a theatre. Wavetable cards (sample-based synthesis cards) are often mounted on sound cards in this manner. Some mezzanine card interface standards include the 400 pin FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC); the 172 pin High Speed Mezzanine Card (HSMC); Jens Kr√∂ger. \\"Data Transmission at High Rates via Kapton Flexprints for the Mu3e Experiment\\". 2014\\\\. p. 43 to 44.

He is the nephew of Hanna-Barbera cartoon star Scooby- Doo.https://archive.org/details/artofhannabarber00teds/page/162/mode/2up?q=Scrappy Scrappy has appeared in a number of the various incarnations of the Scooby-Doo cartoon series. Lennie Weinrib provided his voice for one season in 1979, and from 1980 on it was performed by Don Messick (who also voiced Scooby). In the first live-action theatrical film, video games, and commercials, he was voiced by Scott Innes. He was created to save the show's ratings which by 1979 had begun to sink to the point of cancellation threats from ABC, who were considering choosing between Scooby-Doo and an unnamed pilot from Ruby-Spears Enterprises which Mark Evanier had also written. Download mp3  Behind the scenes  = Hanna-Barbera =  Creation  = Precursors = Though Scrappy officially debuted in the fall of 1979, there may have been hints of his existence in 1969, as he \\"...bore a resemblance to Spears's and Ruby's initial idea for a feisty little dog\\", which was one of the early ideas for the Scooby-Doo character himself, along with the \\"big cowardly dog\\" ultimately chosen. {{cite webauthor = John Latchemurl = http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=11404title = Scooby-Doo Still Going Strong on DVDarchive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201055716/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=11404quote = Joe Ruby and Ken Spears admit that one of their first ideas for a sidekick was a ‚Äòsmall feisty dog‚Äô but ultimately preferred Scooby‚Äôs design. Additionally, hints of Scrappy can also be seen in the fact that there were originally six members of mystery inc planned-Mike Andrews, Linda Blake, Kelly Summers, Geoff Jones, W.W. (Linda's younger brother), and Too Much. It is unknown if one of the personalities was analogous to Scrappy, or which one it would have been. Like Geoff, Mike, and W.W., (and possibly Kelly) Scrappy is male, and like W.W. he was a younger relative of another gang member. Scrappy also bears a significant resemblance to his creator, Joe Barbera, in certain respects: New York City is the hometown of both(\\"Ransom of Scooby Chief\\") Scrappy's father never appears in any series, even for his son's birth, and Joe Barbera's father abandoned the family when Barbera was fifteen. Scrappy's relationship with his Uncle Scooby took far more precedence than the absent father, as did Joe Barbera's maternal uncle Jim fill in as a father. After hearing Joe Barbera's description of the character, writer Mark Evanier, was significantly reminded of the Looney Tunes character Henery Hawk, and incorporated what he knew of said character into the script. = Development = Scrappy's creation officially began in the year of 1978, when Scooby's ratings were sinking to the point of cancellation threats from ABC. ABC's schedule had only one remaining show slot left, which would either go to Scooby or a pilot from Ruby-Spears Enterprises. Joe Barbera created Scrappy as a ‚Äúnew element‚Äù to restore the network's interest in the show. After various staff members, including Joe Barbera, took some shots at writing the character, which the network found unsatisfactory, Joe Barbera went to Mark Evanier, who wrote for the rival pilot to give a shot at writing Scrappy's. Evanier agreed, and Joe Barbera and the executives were satisfied with the results, and, by extension, Scrappy, and chose Scooby over the rival pilot, irritating executive producer Joe Ruby. Scrappy was possibly referenced by Bill Hanna, in February of 1979, when he mentioned work on a \\"little dog character\\"; At around the time Scrappy, a little dog, would have been worked on. Duane Poole, a story editor for the first series Scrappy appeared in, recalled it as a lively time, with lots of new ideas and some new blood being hired with the desperation to revive Scooby, which had been a cash-cow in its glory days. Mel Blanc was the first choice to voice Scrappy, given his connection to Henery Hawk, but wanted too much money to voice the part. Frank Welker, the voice of Fred Jones, auditioned to voice Scrappy as a dual role during the character's development (one of several voice actors considered for the role) and coined the catchphrase \\"Puppy Power\\" during his audition. He would later change this to \\"Monkey Muscle\\" for the similar Donkey Kong Jr. character he would voice for TV's Saturday Supercade. The next choice was Messick, who was seen as giving the best audition, but still deemed \\"the wrong voice\\". Afterwards, other well-known cartoon voice artists were considered or suggested: Daws Butler, Paul Winchell, Marilyn Schreffler, Howard Morris, Dick Beals and Marshall Efron. Ultimately, Lennie Weinrib was chosen. = Appearances in Media =  1979 ‚Äì 1980  Some of the censors took issue with Scrappy's character, citing him as \\"too independent\\" which did result in \\"Scrappy losing a little of his Scrappiness\\"https://www.newsfromme.com/articles-such/scrappy-days/5/, though Scrappy's strong attitude and fighting skills still shown. Scrappy debuted in 1979 on Saturday Morning, getting the 11:30-11:55 slot officially.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/79-OCR/BC-1979-04-16-OCR-Page-0064.pdf After the first season, Messick became the final voice for the rest of the series' run after Weinrib asked for a higher salary.T his was also as a dual role, as Messick also voiced Scooby at the time.  1980 ‚Äì 1982  After his addition to the show proved to be a rating success, the show was moved back a few hours the following year.https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/80-OCR/1980-11-17-BC-OCR-Page-0062.pdf Hanna-Barbera also restructured the show as a means of rebooting the franchise, focusing more on Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. Fred, Velma, and Daphne had struggled to compete with Scrappy's stronger characterization, though writers did try to save them once the new character's presence shed light on it. However, they ultimately were removed by the next season.  1983 ‚Äì 1984  Scrappy continued to appear alongside Shaggy and Scooby in The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show / The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries The threesome were now joined by Daphne, returning after a three-year absence. Scrappy now deferred to Daphne, and the mysteries came back (though there were still real monsters) Howell also speculated, that, at least in Fred's case, he simply didn't return because the writers didn't know what to do with him, despite having Frank Welker on hand.https://scoobydoocast.com/a-night-louse- at-the-white-house-isolated-episode-commentary-with-charles-howell  1985 - 1986  Scrappy remained in the newest incarnation, the 13 ghosts of Scooby-Doo, alongside Shaggy, Scooby, and Daphne, as well as newcomers Vincent Van Ghoul and Flim-Flam. Scrappy also appeared in the Scary Scooby Funnies, a series of repackaged shorts and materials featuring him, Scooby, and Shaggy, and also aired from 1985 to 1986. https://archive.org/details/saturdaymorningt00cain/page/224/mode/2up?q=%22Scary+Scooby+Funnies%22  1987 - 1988  Scrappy remained an integral part of the Scooby-Doo franchise, on both TV and in Scooby-related licensed products and merchandising, through the end of the 1980s. Scrappy's involvement in new Scooby-Doo TV media quietly ended in 1988 the same year that A Pup Named Scooby-Doo aired. His shows went into syndication (as the Scooby shows before his involvement had done when he first entered). He starred in a video game in 1991 and continued to be in reruns. = Cartoon Network = Cartoon Network gained the rights to Scooby around 1994 and promptly set about making it its most shown franchise via reruns of various series. Scooby, which had been dormant for the last few years aside from comics, soon became quite heavily rerun over the place. Cartoon Network's goal was to appeal to the nostalgia of the older fans, as it was documented that a third of their audience was 'old enough to vote'. They opted to appeal to both baby boomers and young children in the 8-11 slot, as, according to the then Vice President at the time, Betty Cohen, \\"[They] felt they were showing kids these cartoons for the first time.\\" Before Cartoon Network gained the rights to Scooby, Scooby's priority target audience had been children: Not just one generation of children, but the general age group, which people entered and exited as years passed. Scooby-Doo was considered a source of massive commercial television time watched by children, as well as something that children imitated. After Turner Broad Casting obtained the rights to Scooby, in the early days of ownership, they too followed this pattern with A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. Chuck Gelman stated in 1994: \\"Scooby-Doo is a popular character with our [12-and-under] demographic and a nice fit with Halloween.\\" Despite this, every demographic was carefully tailored to throughout various day parts. In the campaign to revive Scooby's public consciousness, Scrappy was originally included as part of the burger king promotion in 1996. The flagship of the Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, aired without portraying or commenting on Scrappy on either way, and was a resounding success, causing the live-action movie (which didn't have Scrappy in a major role yet) to be fast-tracked, and three successful DTVs in the way. Between July 1999 (the release of the cartoon network website) and October 1999https://web.archive.org/web/19991005030905/http://cartoonnetwork.com:80/games/index.html (the earliest time present) Cartoon Network released Scrappy Stinks, a game where the sole objective was to pelt Scrappy with a substance referred to as \\"smelly goo\\", but avoid hitting Shaggy and Scooby in the process. At midnight, of October 31, 1999, Cartoon Network aired several promos over the gang's disappearance. One was a promo involving the gang being frightened of Scrappy. In an interview, the writers mention adding that bit because Scrappy's part in the marathon was coming up and they felt the need to work him in. Around 2001, Cartoon Network aired a bumper titled \\"Scrappy Loses It\\" where Scrappy rants about how the newer Cartoon Cartoons were becoming more popular than him despite him being around longer as the Cartoon Cartoons enter the studio in the same order that their schedule aired on prime-time. The bumper ends with Scrappy saying \\"Not for me, not for me, man!\\" in reference to Cartoon Network's then-current slogan, \\"The Best Place for Cartoons\\". =Warner Brothers=  Scooby-Doo Live Action Movie (2002)  Scrappy was first included in the story in an earlier draft around March 2000. He did not physically appear, however, and was only mentioned by Shaggy and Scooby offhand and was heavily implied to have been put to sleep for undisclosed reasons. James Gunn first acknowledged his involvement in April 2000. Other original ideas for the villain included the Old Man Smithers, the villain from the beginning of the film. According to the DVD commentary, choosing the villain of the movie was a problematic part of the production, as the makers did not feel comfortable simply giving the role to an \\"anonymous monster\\", and that the ending was in \\"bits and pieces\\" and the \\"confinements forced them to be creative.\\" \\"There is a Scrappy because he exists in the cartoon, so we have to acknowledge him.\\" Stated screenwriter James Gunn in an interview shortly before the release of Scooby-Doo. Despite previously stating that he felt that \\"kids didn't care\\" he did later note with some dismay on two separate occasions that kids reacted poorly to the development, admitting he didn't understand how popular Scrappy was with five and six-year-olds. \\"I still think it was funny that Scrappy was the villain\\", Gunn explained in an interview with Cinefantastique, \\"But there are kids out there who were really upset.\\"  Character biography  =Pre Series= According to Shaggy, Scrappy was born to Ruby-Doo in St. Bernard's hospital with both Shaggy and Scooby in attendance. Scooby and Shaggy are pacing the waiting room at St. Bernard's Memorial Hospital, as Ruby is being rolled by on a gurney. Ruby is fairly mellow and tells her brother and Shaggy to not worry. Shaggy says they won't, but as she enters the delivery room, they both faint. When they wake up, they are delighted to know that it's a boy. The doctor delivering him comments that he's a \\"scrappy little tyke\\", after trying to play coochie-coo with him, which Scrappy thought was to close, and got angry. Ruby decided to name him Scrappy. When Scooby and Shaggy look through the windowed doors from hearing the commotion, they get knocked into the wall, as Scrappy runs around the hospital, seeking action. Trying to catch up with him, Shaggy and Scooby run into a hospital orderly who gets angry and chases them. Scrappy soon sees them, and join the case. They disguise themselves as parents with a baby. and Scrappy hits the orderly with his rattle, splatting his bubble gum cigar. The orderly chases them (except Scrappy) into the next room where crashing is heard, and Scrappy witnessed the whole thing. Scrappy's mother gives him permission to join Shaggy and Scooby in their journeys, and he gleefully runs and tells them, by now themselves bandaged patients, though he would go on to grow up in New York before officially joining them. Scrappy idolizes his uncle Scooby and would often assist Scooby and his friends in solving mysteries (Scrappy saves Scooby several times from monsters when they were looking for the rest of the gang). =Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979)= Originally as shown in the introduction of the series, Scrappy only met his Uncle Scooby as a puppy. As revealed in the vignette accompanying the series theme-tune, Scooby was waiting for his nephew's train to arrive one stormy night. Scrappy popped out of a box-car in a cardboard box, surprising Scooby. They went on to encounter a bedsheet caught no a tree branch, which Scrappy thought was a ghost and wanted to fight. Scooby rushed the two back to the train station and encountered a mummy. Scrappy stayed back and unraveled the mummy. Scooby encountered and was scared by a scarecrow, at which Scrappy caught up and knocked over the scare-crow. Scooby passed out from all the excitement (Scrappy accidentally moving the scarecrow's jack-o-lantern head as he emerged from its remains being the last straw) and Scrappy carried him the rest of the way to the station. as shown in the Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo opening In The Scarab Lives, Scrappy is the only gang member to wholeheartedly believe that the Scarab has come to life. After, along with Shaggy and Scooby, being quite disturbed along with Shaggy and Scooby also seem disturbed that the comic superhero is now committing crimes, Scrappy is quite eager to capture the Scarab. His first try results in him capturing the scarab and dragging him back by the leg,Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo in The Scarab Lives! but the Scarab is out of costume, causing everybody, Scrappy included, to dismiss this suspect and let him go. After the incident, he's left outside while everyone else investigates the museum. He wanders off to set a trap for the scarab but accidentally catches Scooby (who was covered by a bedsheet at the time. Finally, in the newspaper factory, the Scarab manages to send him, Shaggy, and Scooby on a conveyor belt to the newspaper chopper! Scooby finds a rope for the three to hang onto. Scrappy then swings it down towards where the Scarab is menacing Fred, Velma, and Daphne, dropping down onto his shoulders and covering the man's eyes with his paws. Shaggy and Scooby, meanwhile, crash into a stack f newspaper rolls, paving the way for the Scarab's incapacitation. Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo in The Scarab Lives! In The Night Ghoul of Wonderworld, Scrappy accompanies the other five to Wonderworld, a clear Expy of Westworld, where Velma is going to fulfill her dream of solving a mystery with Sherlock Holmes (represented by a robot) Scrappy doesn't seem to quite grasp that it's not real and needs a gentle, but a firm reminder from Fred to let Velma have the center stage. After the titular night ghoul begins menacing the group for real, Scrappy runs where the Night Ghoul ran, and knocks over a suspect but not the Night Ghoul.Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo in The Night Ghoul of Wonderworld He, Scooby, and Shaggy investigate up in a clock tower intended to replicate Big Ben. The night ghoul is there and chases Shaggy and Scooby and Scooby out to the landing. Scrappy sees, and grabs the night ghoul by his cape, tussling with him like this while Shaggy and Scooby scramble back inside. Scrappy then lands on a clock hand, terrifying Shaggy and Scooby for his safety (Scrappy is having a jolly good time and oblivious to their fear for him) they manage to get him back into big-ben, where Scrappy sees the night ghoul on one of the clock's gear and spins the gear, capturing the night ghoul and allowing the others to wrap up the mystery.Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo in The Night Ghoul of Wonderworld Close Encounters of The Scooby Kind!: Scrappy is quite excited at the idea of an actual alien around, quite literally rushing Scooby out in the middle of the older Doo packing to make a hasty exit. He gets a suspect‚Äôs boot and sets a trap for the alien if it enters the barricaded cabin. But he caught Fred, Velma, and Daphne instead. Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo in Close Encounters of The Scooby Kind! After that's dealt with and Fred, Velma, and Daphne are released, the six resume hunting for clues, Scrappy, with Shaggy and Scooby, gets trapped in the alien‚Äôs prop spaceship. Mistakenly believing themselves to be in ‚ÄòPlanet X‚Äô, the three cook up a plan using Italian restaurant disguises (with Scrappy hiding in Scooby‚Äôs chef‚Äôs hat) After they get back with the others, he, Shaggy, and Scooby learned that they never left actually departed earth. Shiver and Shake, That Demon's A Snake! Scrappy is with the rest of the gang while they vacation in Haiti. He doesn't really care much about curses, treating it as another adversary to fight. He catches the monster twice (the first time didn't stick because his current companions were too terrified to think straight and whisked him away from where it was in his secure clutches) the second time sticks, allowing for Velma to explain the clues before pulling the monster's mask off. The Scary Sky Skeleton! Scrappy accompanies Shaggy, Fred, Velma, Scooby, and Daphne to visit Daphne's stunt pilot friend. The Demon of the Dugout Scrappy, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, Scooby, and Daphne go to Japan to watch a baseball championship. However, upon learning that the demon f the dugout is on the loose, Scrappy is more than eager to investigate. Hairy Scare of the Devil Bear: Scrappy is present with the gang on vacation to the grand canyon, who meets the devil bear. Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea Scrappy is with the gang is in Acapulco to watch the cliff diving show. However, they encounter the Sea Beast of the Aztecs which scares the divers off and haunts a bay. Scrappy makes an impressive replica of the monster (and is indignant when pulled away from his creation). At the end of the episode, he uses Scoby as a model and shows it off to Velma.

Scrappy and Yabba are excited, and Dusty is nervous. When claim jumpers steal the map, Yabba and Scrappy are determined to find it. The two canines use the old touchdown trick to tag team man in a bear costume, and though the gold it turns out to be fool's gold, they still laugh about it. Tragic Magic Scrappy, Yabba, and Dusty are guarding a gold shipment in the Tumbleweed Bank. As they pace around the bank entrance, a traveling magician named Mysto comes to town to put on a magic show.

Mysto performs a disappearing trick with Yabba and Dusty as his volunteers, while Grimes loads the safe into the van. Scrappy gets trapped in Mysto's hat while the crooks escape with the gold, with the trio in pursuit. Yabba disguise himself as Mysto, and distracts Grimes by pretending to practice magic tricks, while Scrappy disguised as a bunny ties up Grimes. Mysto however, shows up, and uses his own trick to tie up the dogs, while he and Grimes drive off. After Dusty unties them, they hopped on the chopper and followed the crooks to the airstrip. They arrived just in time when the crooks were starting to fly away with the safe. Yabba attempts to stop the plane with the same trick Mysto used on them earlier, but it failed. Refusing to give up, Yabba tries one last magic trick. Putting his hat on the ground, he calls for the plane to come to him, and to Scrappy and Dusty's amazement, the plane breaks apart and is pulled into the hat along with the crooks. Yabba then says some magic words, and the broken plane and the crooks emerged from the hat. Dusty asks how Yabba did that, but all he said was a magician never reveals his secrets.

Dusty scolds Scrappy for flattening his hat, hurting his feelings. He turned on the TV when a reporter announces that a train carrying a shipment of silver will be passing Tumbleweed in the morning. Scrappy suggests that they protect the silver, in case thieves try to steal it. Dusty dismisses him saying that's a job for the Federal Martials, and sends him to bed. Scrappy quietly acquiesces, believing that this means that he doesn't know anything about crime-fighting. Dusty and Yabba try to get rid of the mosquito from before, talking about it angrily. Scrappy overhears them and thinks they're talking about him. Feeling unloved, he decides to run away. The robbers arrive at their destination, but, Shorty's nowhere to be seen. Without him, they can't rob the train, since he's the only one small enough to climb through the air vent. They spot Scrappy moping and decides to use him instead. They claim to be Martials sent to take back stolen silver from the train, and offer him to help, which Scrappy accepts. Meanwhile, Yabba and Dusty discovered that Scrappy's run away because he believed that they wanted him to leave. Dusty feels guilty about how he treated Scrappy, so he and Yabba went out to bring him home. The robbers put a boulder on the tracks to stop the train and instruct Scrappy to take the silver. Yabba and Dusty follow the tracks looking for Scrappy and recognizes the robbers. Yabba digs a tunnel to sneak up on them but ended up in front of them instead. The robbers tied up and gagged them, when Scrappy returned with the silver, not noticing Yabba and Dusty. He leaves with the robbers, while Yabba and Dusty free themselves. The robbers no longer need Scrappy, and leave him on his own again, crying. Yabba and Dusty spot the robbers after they ditched Scrappy. They disguise themselves as females, waiting to catch them off guard. But, they were discovered and put in the ghost town jail. Dusty gives Yabba chili snacks to create smoke signals. Scrappy sees them and frees Yabba and Dusty. Scrappy apologizes for being tricked, but he's forgiven. With no time to lose, they headed off to stop the robbers. Yabba tried lassoing them, but, ended up being pulled away. Scrappy puts a tumbleweed in the robbers' path. Thinking they can just run over it, they refuse to stop. However, the tumbleweed had an anvil hidden inside, which knocked the robbers in a billboard, trapping them. Scrappy doesn't think Yabba and Dusty would need him anymore. But Dusty says they couldn't get along without him, and Yabba agrees, saying that they're like the three musketeers. Slippery Dan The Escape Man Scrappy, Yabba, and Dusty are on their way to the warden at the state pen by train, to turn over the world's sneakiest escape artist, Slippery Dan. However, when they pass a tunnel, Slippery Dan escapes and puts the lawmen in his chains. Fortunately, Yabba uses Dusty's badge as a chainsaw, freeing them (at the loss of all their hair, which they then simply put back on). They chase Dan, and keep failing, until they bring a small house of mirrors with the repaired chopper, with a sign that says \\"International Border\\". Slippery Dan enters it, thinking he's escaped the law. But, he soon finds out that he's been tricked, and that they trap him in the one place he could never escape from, and they won't let him out until they turn him in. Yabba says that someday outlaws will learn to never mess with him. Scrappy wishes to be just like Yabba when he grows up, which unnerves Dusty. Low-Down Show-Down Dusty is terrified of being hounded by an outlaw he imprisoned. It's now up to Scrappy and Yabba to pull some strings to scare off Bucko without letting the town find out that the Sherriff is a coward.

Scrappy displays little concern for his own safety - he'll think nothing of charging into a confrontation with anything up to and including an elephant stampede - yet he is also very protective of his uncle and their teenage owners, sticking up for them relentlessly. Scrappy's greatest weakness - unrecognized by himself - is a lack of discretion, which tends to counteract his valor. Being more zealous than clever, he'll often rush ahead of his Mystery Inc. associates to apprehend the first suspect he encounters - who seldom turns out to be the one they're looking for. (Once, in San Francisco, Scrappy mistakenly picked up and brought back Daphne - his own mistress - thinking she was a vampire they'd been hunting!) More than anything else, Scrappy requires guidance in much the same way that Shaggy and Scooby require motivation. If his courageous and energetic personality wasn't enough to make him stand out, Scrappy could be identified by a handful of catchphrases; two of the better-known were, \\"Lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em! I'll splat 'em! I'll rock 'em and sock 'em!\\" and, \\"Ta dadada ta daaa! Puppy power!\\". Scrappy also possessed strength which belied his diminutive stature; he was capable of smashing down solid rock walls, and of carrying bulky loads over his head with no apparent effort. In some incarnations which retain the mystery genre but don't feature the entire gang, such as Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers and The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show Scrappy's sense of recklessness is downplayed, and he often helps find and interpret clues or getting the gang out of danger in the place of Fred and Velma. As befitting the light-hearted tone of the series, Scrappy was upbeat by nature and rarely sad, but not without a sensitive side which he shared with the Mystery Incorporated gang. In later episodes, Scrappy became more reserved and better at finding clues...opting to ask questions first and shoot later, as it were. However, his feisty and adventurous streak continued to shine through - especially in the proverbial crunch. (After all, he wouldn't be Scrappy-Doo if he didn't push the envelope - or, rather, chew it up - every once in a while.) Reception Scrappy was initially seen as a \\"good idea\\" by Saturday Morning Review. Viewership also seemed to react positively to Scrappy, as Scooby's ratings went up with Scrappy's arrival, and continued to be a success for the next decade.In Memory of Joseph Barbera Stu's Show. Retrieved 03-18-2013. With Scrappy's addition the show remained a perennial ratings leader. Story Editor Duane Poole noted, ‚ÄúScrappy solved a lot of story problems. Before you had to get Shaggy and Scooby into dangerous situations-and there was no real easy way to get them there-with Scrappy, he, uh, picked them up and carried them there. He just charged in. He was just such the antithesis of what Scooby and Shaggy were. The dynamic was great fun to play.‚Äù Joe Ruby and Ken Spears seemed to have a less than positive view on the character. The co-founder of Ruby-Spears enterprises said, \\"Everyone was upset\\", though was unclear about whether this concerned business reasons (they had started their own company two years earlier) or personal creative reasons (considering that if Scooby'd been canceled, then the last slot would have hit their show instead) , starting when, in 1979, it looked a pilot of theirs would be renewed over Scooby's. Mark Evanier, who wrote said pilot, was hired impromptu to write Scrappy-Doo into a new pilot to renew interest in Scooby. As a result, Scooby was renewed over theirs, which was upsetting for them. \\"Scrappy would charge in and solve things, so he was useful, in that way. A lot of people made derogatory comments about it at the studio and you know you don't want to be saddled with something based on, you know, network [...] but I think I liked working with it most of those cartoons.\\"https://scoobydoocast.com/apnsd- episode-21-interview-with-charles-m-howell-part-two Said Charles M. Howell, a writer who originally joined the franchise back on The New Scooby and Scrappy- Doo Show and continued to work on various iterations of the show until finally ending his tenure in the late '80s after penning the pilot episode for A Pup Named Scooby-Doo.https://scoobydoocast.com/apnsd-podcast-episode-20-interview- with-charles-m-howell-part-one Tom Ruegger, stated, \\"It's a lot easier to love Scooby than it is to love Scrappy. But I don't have the problem with Scrappy that I have heard expressed by others. I suspect this is because I wasn't watching Scooby from the beginning, but rather, I came in and started catching up quite a while (a couple of years) after Scrappy had made his debut. Hey, they'd been messing with Scooby's cast for years! Scooby Dum. All those nasty celebrity cameo Scooby movies. I dislike those things more than I dislike Scrappy. And, for what it's worth, at least Scrappy brings some energy to the table. He actually does have a personality, even though many find it obnoxious. [...] So, since I tend to love the characters with whom I work, I can say that I learned to love Scrappy, despite all his limitations.\\" Casper Kelly, one of the writers of The Scooby-Doo Project also admitted to having Scrappy as being in his first memory of Scooby, as well as enjoying when the monsters were real over the traditional fake monster format. When Archie gained the rights to Hanna-Barbera in 1995, both Bill Vallely and Mike Kirschenbaum, two writers for the series, both acknowledged that Scrappy was hated, and even attempted to remake his personality in response to that, according to Kirschenbaum, but \\"the animosity was too great\\" and Scrappy got the boot from the series midway.< After Archie Comics concluded as a series, DC Comics picked up rights and produced Scooby-Doo for some time after that, and, possibly taking their cue from Archie, continued with Scrappy being gone. In 1998, Jon Hein published his Jump the Shark website, a site dedicated to complaining about unwelcome changes to beloved shows. Each show had a page (and some spin-offs got pages of their own)-patrons to the site could read the page of the show they chose, then go to the voting page, choose a show or enter one that wasn't listed to vote on, choose a topic (or enter one that wasn't listed) and then submit and repeat as many times as they so wished. The site staff received these submissions and then posted them on the appropriate pages. These were added as choices to a poll, that, if one thought Scrappy ruined the show, they could add their vote. Scrappy was entered in on the Scooby-Doo section and received approximately 1500 votes. Although names had to be provided along with comments, the comments published were completely anonymous. In September, celebrating his uncle's thirtieth anniversary, several newspapers printed articles, some of which mentioned Scrappy.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12398229/scooby-doo-30th-anniversary- article/https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=12398262&fcfToken;=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjEwNzIwOTM1OSwiaWF0IjoxNjAwMzE4OTU5LCJleHAiOjE2MDA0MDUzNTl9.cxJ87Z2XgP49YIAZqaNc7XhuBC39z6Q2HqMJFkogiCchttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/12398105/scooby- doo-still-solving- mysteries/https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=12376187&fcfToken;=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjEyNDQ2OTkwNiwiaWF0IjoxNjAwMzE4OTc4LCJleHAiOjE2MDA0MDUzNzh9.20A3bCa6coYjol_eAjeT-3F-kcUrN6VkwTvVJ-5xjFM Hein's unique complaint website gained newspaper coverage by Maureen Dowd, in 2001, who published an opinion article entitled \\"Scrappy-Doo Spoiled Scooby- Doo\\", though Scrappy actually featured very little in the article and said article was written with a political punchline in mind, word picked up and Jump the Shark (and Scrappy's presence in it) were soon republished from across the country under various titles, some of which included Scrappy and some of which did not. In 2020, it has come out from Casper Kelly that many writers who worked with Scrappy's character did not actually hate him.

While in a bar reminiscing, Velma tells another patron that the gang kicked Scrappy out of their ranks because he peed on Daphne and demanded to be the new leader. Velma also claims that Scrappy was not really a puppy but rather had a glandular disorder. (Although the movie's understanding of canine endocrinology is extremely simplified; Scrappy only displays dwarfism and is otherwise completely free of the myriad of other degenerative conditions any glandular disorder would entail) In the course of the film, it is revealed that he is seeking to summon a demon army that he can use to rule the world, with the ritual requiring him to absorb a purely good soul to unleash the full power of his army, with Scrappy selecting Scooby as the final sacrifice. However, his ego causes him to call in the rest of the Mystery Inc. crew to witness his triumph despite them having gone their separate ways two years ago, with the gang rallying to defeat Scrappy's plan and save Scooby by disrupting the ritual. At the conclusion of the film, Velma says that Scrappy's full name is Scrappy Cornelius Doo. * In An Evening with the Scooby Gang, a bonus feature on the Aloha, Scooby-Doo!

The terms Internet telephony, broadband telephony, and broadband phone service specifically refer to the provisioning of communications services (voice, fax, SMS, voice-messaging) over the public Internet, rather than via the public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as plain old telephone service (POTS). Overview The steps and principles involved in originating VoIP telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling, channel setup, digitization of the analog voice signals, and encoding. Instead of being transmitted over a circuit-switched network, the digital information is packetized and transmission occurs as IP packets over a packet-switched network. They transport media streams using special media delivery protocols that encode audio and video with audio codecs and video codecs. Various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth; some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech, while others support high-fidelity stereo codecs. The most widely speech coding standards in VoIP are based on the linear predictive coding (LPC) and modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) compression methods. Popular codecs include the MDCT-based AAC-LD (used in FaceTime), the LPC/MDCT-based Opus (used in WhatsApp), the LPC-based SILK (used in Skype), Œº-law and A-law versions of G.711, G.722, and an open source voice codec known as iLBC, a codec that uses only 8 kbit/s each way called G.729. Early providers of voice-over-IP services used business models and offered technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network. Second-generation providers, such as Skype, built closed networks for private user bases, offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks, such as the PSTN. This limited the freedom of users to mix-and-match third-party hardware and software. Third-generation providers, such as Google Talk, adopted the concept of federated VoIP. These solutions typically allow dynamic interconnection between users in any two domains of the Internet, when a user wishes to place a call. In addition to VoIP phones, VoIP is also available on many personal computers and other Internet access devices. Calls and SMS text messages may be sent via Wi-Fi or the carrier's mobile data network. VoIP provides a framework for consolidation of all modern communications technologies using a single unified communications system. Pronunciation VoIP is variously pronounced as an initialism, V-O-I-P, or as an acronym /Ààv…î…™p/ (voyp), as in voice. Full words, voice over Internet Protocol, or voice over IP, are sometimes used. Protocols Voice over IP has been implemented with proprietary protocols and protocols based on open standards in applications such as VoIP phones, mobile applications, and web- based communications. A variety of functions are needed to implement VoIP communication. Some protocols perform multiple functions, while others perform only a few and must be used in concert. These functions include: * Network and transport ‚Äì Creating reliable transmission over unreliable protocols, which may involve acknowledging receipt of data and retransmitting data that wasn't received. * Session management ‚Äì Creating and managing a session (sometimes glossed as simply a \\"call\\"), which is a connection between two or more peers that provides a context for further communication. * Signaling ‚Äì Performing registration (advertising one's presence and contact information) and discovery (locating someone and obtaining their contact information), dialing (including reporting call progress), negotiating capabilities, and call control (such as hold, mute, transfer/forwarding, dialing DTMF keys during a call [e.g. to interact with an automated attendant or IVR], etc.). * Media description ‚Äì Determining what type of media to send (audio, video, etc.), how to encode/decode it, and how to send/receive it (IP addresses, ports, etc.). * Media ‚Äì Transferring the actual media in the call, such as audio, video, text messages, files, etc. * Quality of service ‚Äì Providing out-of-band content or feedback about the media such as synchronization, statistics, etc. * Security ‚Äì Implementing access control, verifying the identity of other participants (computers or people), and encrypting data to protect the privacy and integrity of the media contents and/or the control messages. VoIP protocols include: * Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), connection management protocol developed by the IETF * H.323, one of the first VoIP call signaling and control protocols that found widespread implementation. Since the development of newer, less complex protocols such as MGCP and SIP, H.323 deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long-haul network traffic. * Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), connection management for media gateways * H.248, control protocol for media gateways across a converged internetwork consisting of the traditional PSTN and modern packet networks * Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), transport protocol for real-time audio and video data * Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), sister protocol for RTP providing stream statistics and status information * Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), encrypted version of RTP * Session Description Protocol (SDP), a syntax for session initiation and announcement for multi- media communications and WebSocket transports. * Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX), protocol used between Asterisk PBX instances * Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), instant messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance * Jingle, for peer-to-peer session control in XMPP * Skype protocol, proprietary Internet telephony protocol suite based on peer-to-peer architecture Adoption =Consumer market= Example of residential network including VoIP Mass-market VoIP services use existing broadband Internet access, by which subscribers place and receive telephone calls in much the same manner as they would via the PSTN. Full-service VoIP phone companies provide inbound and outbound service with direct inbound dialing. Many offer unlimited domestic calling and sometimes international calls for a flat monthly subscription fee. Phone calls between subscribers of the same provider are usually free when flat-fee service is not available. A VoIP phone is necessary to connect to a VoIP service provider. This can be implemented in several ways: * Dedicated VoIP phones connect directly to the IP network using technologies such as wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These are typically designed in the style of traditional digital business telephones. * An analog telephone adapter connects to the network and implements the electronics and firmware to operate a conventional analog telephone attached through a modular phone jack. Some residential Internet gateways and cablemodems have this function built in. * Softphone application software installed on a networked computer that is equipped with a microphone and speaker, or headset. The application typically presents a dial pad and display field to the user to operate the application by mouse clicks or keyboard input. =PSTN and mobile network providers= It is increasingly common for telecommunications providers to use VoIP telephony over dedicated and public IP networks as a backhaul to connect switching centers and to interconnect with other telephony network providers; this is often referred to as IP backhaul. Smartphones may have SIP clients built into the firmware or available as an application download. =Corporate use= Because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs that VoIP technology can provide, businesses are migrating from traditional copper-wire telephone systems to VoIP systems to reduce their monthly phone costs. In 2008, 80% of all new Private branch exchange (PBX) lines installed internationally were VoIP. For example, in the United States, the Social Security Administration is converting its field offices of 63,000 workers from traditional phone installations to a VoIP infrastructure carried over its existing data network. VoIP allows both voice and data communications to be run over a single network, which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs. The prices of extensions on VoIP are lower than for PBX and key systems. VoIP switches may run on commodity hardware, such as personal computers. Rather than closed architectures, these devices rely on standard interfaces. VoIP devices have simple, intuitive user interfaces, so users can often make simple system configuration changes. Dual-mode phones enable users to continue their conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal Wi-Fi network, so that it is no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cell phone. Maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee. VoIP solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into unified communications services that treat all communications‚Äîphone calls, faxes, voice mail, e-mail, web conferences, and more‚Äîas discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset, including cellphones. Two kinds of service providers are operating in this space: one set is focused on VoIP for medium to large enterprises, while another is targeting the small-to- medium business (SMB) market. Skype, which originally marketed itself as a service among friends, has begun to cater to businesses, providing free-of- charge connections between any users on the Skype network and connecting to and from ordinary PSTN telephones for a charge.  Delivery Mechanisms  In general, the provision of VoIP telephony systems to organisational or individual users can be divided into two primary delivery methods: private or on-premises solutions, or externally hosted solutions delivered by third-party providers. On-premises delivery methods are more akin to the classic PBX deployment model for connecting an office to local PSTN networks. While many use cases still remain for private or on-premises VoIP systems, the wider market has been gradually shifting toward 'Cloud' or Hosted' VoIP solutions. Hosted systems are also generally better suited to smaller or personal use VoIP deployments, where a private system may not be viable for these scenarios. = Hosted VoIP Systems = As with any other SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, 'Hosted' or 'Cloud' VoIP solutions involve a service provider or telecommunications carrier hosting the prerequisite telephone system as a software solution within their own infrastructure. Typically this will be one or more datacentres, with geographic relevance to the end user(s) of the system. This infrastructure is external to the user of the system, and is deployed and maintained by the service provider. Endpoints, such as VoIP telephones or softphone applications (apps running on a computer or mobile device), will therefore connect to the VoIP service remotely. These connections typically take place over public internet links, such as local fixed WAN breakout or mobile carrier service (such as 4G). = Private VoIP Systems = In the case of a private VoIP system, the primary telephony system itself is located within the private infrastructure of the end user organisation. Usually, the system will be deployed on-premises at a site within the direct control of the organisation. This can provide numerous benefits in terms of QoS control (see below), cost scalability, and ensuring privacy and security of communications traffic. However, the responsibility for ensuring that the VoIP system remains performant and resilient is predominantly vested in the end user organisation. This is not the case with a Hosted VoIP solution. Private VoIP systems can be physical hardware PBX appliances, converged with other infrastructure, or they can be deployed as software applications. Generally the latter two options will be in the form of a separate virtualised appliance. However in some scenarios, these systems are deployed on bare metal infrastructure or IoT devices. With some solutions, such as 3CX, companies can attempt to blend the benefits of hosted and private on-premises systems by implementing their own private solution but within an external environment. Examples can include datacentre collocation services, public cloud, or private cloud locations. For on-premises systems, local endpoints within the same location typically connect directly over the LAN. For remote and external endpoints, available connectivity options mirror those of Hosted or Cloud VoIP solutions. However, VoIP traffic to and from the on- premises systems can often also be sent over secure private links. Examples include personal VPN, site-to-site VPN, private networks such as MPLS and SD- WAN, or via private SBCs (Session Border Controllers). While exceptions and private peering options do exist, it is generally uncommon for those private connectivity methods to be provided by Hosted or Cloud VoIP providers. Quality of service Communication on the IP network is perceived as less reliable in contrast to the circuit-switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network-based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost, and are delivered in sequential order. It is a best-effort network without fundamental Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Voice, and all other data, travels in packets over IP networks with fixed maximum capacity. This system may be more prone to data loss in the presence of congestion than traditional circuit switched systems; a circuit switched system of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment, while the quality of real-time data such as telephone conversations on packet-switched networks degrades dramatically. Therefore, VoIP implementations may face problems with latency, packet loss, and jitter. By default, network routers handle traffic on a first-come, first-served basis. Fixed delays cannot be controlled as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel. They are especially problematic when satellite circuits are involved because of the long distance to a geostationary satellite and back; delays of 400‚Äì600 ms are typical. Latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay-sensitive with QoS methods such as DiffServ. Network routers on high volume traffic links may introduce latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for VoIP. Excessive load on a link can cause congestion and associated queueing delays and packet loss. This signals a transport protocol like TCP to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion. But VoIP usually uses UDP not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency. So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link, even when the link is congested by bulk traffic. VoIP endpoints usually have to wait for completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent. Although it is possible to preempt (abort) a less important packet in mid- transmission, this is not commonly done, especially on high-speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum-sized packets. An alternative to preemption on slower links, such as dialup and digital subscriber line (DSL), is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the maximum transmission unit. But since every packet must contain protocol headers, this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed. The receiver must resequence IP packets that arrive out of order and recover gracefully when packets arrive too late or not at all. Packet delay variation results from changes in queuing delay along a given network path due to competition from other users for the same transmission links. VoIP receivers accommodate this variation by storing incoming packets briefly in a playout buffer, deliberately increasing latency to improve the chance that each packet will be on hand when it is time for the voice engine to play it. The added delay is thus a compromise between excessive latency and excessive dropout, i.e. momentary audio interruptions. Although jitter is a random variable, it is the sum of several other random variables which are at least somewhat independent: the individual queuing delays of the routers along the Internet path in question. Motivated by the central limit theorem, jitter can be modeled as a gaussian random variable. This suggests continually estimating the mean delay and its standard deviation and setting the playout delay so that only packets delayed more than several standard deviations above the mean will arrive too late to be useful. In practice, the variance in latency of many Internet paths is dominated by a small number (often one) of relatively slow and congested bottleneck links. Most Internet backbone links are now so fast (e.g. 10 Gbit/s) that their delays are dominated by the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber) and the routers driving them do not have enough buffering for queuing delays to be significant. A number of protocols have been defined to support the reporting of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for VoIP calls. These include RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) extended reports, SIP RTCP summary reports, H.460.9 Annex B (for H.323), H.248.30 and MGCP extensions. The RTCP extended report VoIP metrics block specified by is generated by an IP phone or gateway during a live call and contains information on packet loss rate, packet discard rate (because of jitter), packet loss/discard burst metrics (burst length/density, gap length/density), network delay, end system delay, signal/noise/echo level, mean opinion scores (MOS) and R factors and configuration information related to the jitter buffer. VoIP metrics reports are exchanged between IP endpoints on an occasional basis during a call, and an end of call message sent via SIP RTCP summary report or one of the other signaling protocol extensions. VoIP metrics reports are intended to support real-time feedback related to QoS problems, the exchange of information between the endpoints for improved call quality calculation and a variety of other applications. =DSL and ATM= DSL modems typically provide Ethernet connections to local equipment, but inside they may actually be Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) modems. They use ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) to segment each Ethernet packet into a series of 53-byte ATM cells for transmission, reassembling them back into Ethernet frames at the receiving end. Using a separate virtual circuit identifier (VCI) for audio over IP has the potential to reduce latency on shared connections. ATM's potential for latency reduction is greatest on slow links, because worst-case latency decreases with increasing link speed. A full-size (1500 byte) Ethernet frame takes 94 ms to transmit at 128 kbit/s but only 8 ms at 1.5 Mbit/s. If this is the bottleneck link, this latency is probably small enough to ensure good VoIP performance without MTU reductions or multiple ATM VCs. The latest generations of DSL, VDSL and VDSL2, carry Ethernet without intermediate ATM/AAL5 layers, and they generally support IEEE 802.1p priority tagging so that VoIP can be queued ahead of less time-critical traffic. ATM has substantial header overhead: 5/53 = 9.4%, roughly twice the total header overhead of a 1500 byte Ethernet frame. This \\"ATM tax\\" is incurred by every DSL user whether or not they take advantage of multiple virtual circuits ‚Äì and few can. =Layer 2= Several protocols are used in the data link layer and physical layer for quality-of-service mechanisms that help VoIP applications work well even in the presence of network congestion. Some examples include: * IEEE 802.11e is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that defines a set of quality-of-service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modifications to the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical importance for delay-sensitive applications, such as voice over wireless IP. * IEEE 802.1p defines 8 different classes of service (including one dedicated to voice) for traffic on layer-2 wired Ethernet. * The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit per second) Local area network (LAN) using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). G.hn provides QoS by means of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) which are allocated to flows (such as a VoIP call) which require QoS and which have negotiated a contract with the network controllers. Performance metrics The quality of voice transmission is characterized by several metrics that may be monitored by network elements and by the user agent hardware or software. Such metrics include network packet loss, packet jitter, packet latency (delay), post-dial delay, and echo. The metrics are determined by VoIP performance testing and monitoring.CableLabs, PacketCable Residential SIP Telephony Feature Definition, Technical Report, PKT-TR-RST-V03-071106 (2007) PSTN integration A VoIP media gateway controller (aka Class 5 Softswitch) works in cooperation with a media gateway (aka IP Business Gateway) and connects the digital media stream, so as to complete the path for voice and data. Gateways include interfaces for connecting to standard PSTN networks. Ethernet interfaces are also included in the modern systems which are specially designed to link calls that are passed via VoIP. E.164 is a global numbering standard for both the PSTN and public land mobile network (PLMN). Most VoIP implementations support E.164 to allow calls to be routed to and from VoIP subscribers and the PSTN/PLMN. VoIP implementations can also allow other identification techniques to be used. For example, Skype allows subscribers to choose Skype names (usernames) whereas SIP implementations can use Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) similar to email addresses. Often VoIP implementations employ methods of translating non-E.164 identifiers to E.164 numbers and vice versa, such as the Skype-In service provided by Skype and the E.164 number to URI mapping (ENUM) service in IMS and SIP. Echo can also be an issue for PSTN integration. Common causes of echo include impedance mismatches in analog circuitry and acoustic coupling of the transmit and receive signal at the receiving end. =Number portability= Local number portability (LNP) and mobile number portability (MNP) also impact VoIP business. In November 2007, the Federal Communications Commission in the United States released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers. Number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued. Typically, it is the responsibility of the former carrier to \\"map\\" the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier. This is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers. A dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier. Multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier. The FCC mandates carrier compliance with these consumer-protection stipulations. A voice call originating in the VoIP environment also faces challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier. VoIP has been identified in the past as a Least Cost Routing (LCR) system, which is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made, and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least. This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability. With GSM number portability now in place, LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call. Instead, they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call. Therefore, VoIP solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database, like the UK, it might be necessary to query the GSM network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to. As the popularity of VoIP increases in the enterprise markets because of least cost routing options, it needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls. =Emergency calls= A telephone connected to a land line has a direct relationship between a telephone number and a physical location, which is maintained by the telephone company and available to emergency responders via the national emergency response service centers in form of emergency subscriber lists. When an emergency call is received by a center the location is automatically determined from its databases and displayed on the operator console. In IP telephony, no such direct link between location and communications end point exists. Even a provider having hardware infrastructure, such as a DSL provider, may know only the approximate location of the device, based on the IP address allocated to the network router and the known service address. Some ISPs do not track the automatic assignment of IP addresses to customer equipment. IP communication provides for device mobility. For example, a residential broadband connection may be used as a link to a virtual private network of a corporate entity, in which case the IP address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise, not being the IP address of the residential ISP. Such off-premises extensions may appear as part of an upstream IP PBX. On mobile devices, e.g., a 3G handset or USB wireless broadband adapter, the IP address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider, since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage, even roaming via another cellular company. At the VoIP level, a phone or gateway may identify itself with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registrar by its account credentials. In such cases, the Internet telephony service provider (ITSP) knows only that a particular user's equipment is active. Service providers often provide emergency response services by agreement with the user who registers a physical location and agrees that emergency services are provided to that address only if an emergency number is called from the IP device. Such emergency services are provided by VoIP vendors in the United States by a system called Enhanced 911 (E911), based on the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999. The VoIP E911 emergency-calling system associates a physical address with the calling party's telephone number. All VoIP providers that provide access to the public switched telephone network are required to implement E911, a service for which the subscriber may be charged. \\"VoIP providers may not allow customers to \\"opt-out\\" of 911 service.\\" The VoIP E911 system is based on a static table lookup. Unlike in cellular phones, where the location of an E911 call can be traced using assisted GPS or other methods, the VoIP E911 information is accurate only if subscribers, who have the legal responsibility, keep their emergency address information current. Fax support Sending faxes over VoIP networks is sometimes referred to as Fax over IP (FoIP). Transmission of fax documents was problematic in early VoIP implementations, as most voice digitization and compression codecs are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet-based, connection-less network. A standards-based solution for reliably delivering fax-over-IP is the T.38 protocol. The T.38 protocol is designed to compensate for the differences between traditional packet-less communications over analog lines and packet-based transmissions which are the basis for IP communications. The fax machine may be a standard device connected to an analog telephone adapter (ATA), or it may be a software application or dedicated network device operating via an Ethernet interface.Soft-Switch.org, Faxing over IP networks Originally, T.38 was designed to use UDP or TCP transmission methods across an IP network. UDP provides near real-time characteristics due to the \\"no recovery rule\\" when a UDP packet is lost or an error occurs during transmission. Some newer high end fax machines have built-in T.38 capabilities which are connected directly to a network switch or router. In T.38 each packet contains a portion of the data stream sent in the previous packet. Two successive packets have to be lost to actually lose data integrity. Power requirements Telephones for traditional residential analog service are usually connected directly to telephone company phone lines which provide direct current to power most basic analog handsets independently of locally available electrical power. IP Phones and VoIP telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power. Some VoIP service providers use customer premises equipment (e.g., cablemodems) with battery-backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures. Such battery- backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets. Some VoIP service providers implement services to route calls to other telephone services of the subscriber, such a cellular phone, in the event that the customer's network device is inaccessible to terminate the call. The susceptibility of phone service to power failures is a common problem even with traditional analog service in areas where many customers purchase modern telephone units that operate with wireless handsets to a base station, or that have other modern phone features, such as built-in voicemail or phone book features. Security The security concerns of VoIP telephone systems are similar to those of other Internet-connected devices. This means that hackers with knowledge of VoIP vulnerabilities can perform denial-of-service attacks, harvest customer data, record conversations, and compromise voicemail messages. Compromised VoIP user account or session credentials may enable an attacker to incur substantial charges from third-party services, such as long- distance or international calling. The technical details of many VoIP protocols create challenges in routing VoIP traffic through firewalls and network address translators, used to interconnect to transit networks or the Internet. Private session border controllers are often employed to enable VoIP calls to and from protected networks. Other methods to traverse NAT devices involve assistive protocols such as STUN and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). Though many consumer VoIP solutions do not support encryption of the signaling path or the media, securing a VoIP phone is conceptually easier to implement than on traditional telephone circuits. A result of the lack of encryption is that it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on VoIP calls when access to the data network is possible. Free open-source solutions, such as Wireshark, facilitate capturing VoIP conversations. Standards for securing VoIP are available in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and the ZRTP protocol for analog telephony adapters, as well as for some softphones. IPsec is available to secure point-to-point VoIP at the transport level by using opportunistic encryption. Government and military organizations use various security measures to protect VoIP traffic, such as voice over secure IP (VoSIP), secure voice over IP (SVoIP), and secure voice over secure IP (SVoSIP).Disa.mil, Internet Protocol Telephony & Voice over Internet Protocol Security Technical Implementation Guide The distinction lies in whether encryption is applied in the telephone endpoint or in the network.Secure Voice over IP (SVoIP) vs. Voice over Secure IP (VoSIP) Installations General Dynamics C4 Systems Secure voice over secure IP may be implemented by encrypting the media with protocols such as SRTP and ZRTP. Secure voice over IP uses Type 1 encryption on a classified network, such as SIPRNet.Sans.org, SANS Institute InfoSec Reading Room Public Secure VoIP is also available with free GNU software and in many popular commercial VoIP programs via libraries, such as ZRTP. Caller ID Voice over IP protocols and equipment provide caller ID support that is compatible the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Many VoIP service providers also allow callers to configure custom caller ID information.VOIPSA.org, Blog: \\"Hello Mom, I'm a Fake!\\" (Telespoof and Fakecaller). Hearing aid compatibility Wireline telephones which are manufactured in, imported to, or intended to be used in the US with Voice over IP service, on or after February 28, 2020, are required to meet the hearing aid compatibility requirements set forth by the Federal Communications Commission. Operational cost VoIP has drastically reduced the cost of communication by sharing network infrastructure between data and voice.FCC.gov, What are some advantages of VoIP? A single broad-band connection has the ability to transmit more than one telephone call. Secure calls using standardized protocols, such as Secure Real-time Transport Protocol, as most of the facilities of creating a secure telephone connection over traditional phone lines, such as digitizing and digital transmission, are already in place with VoIP. It is necessary only to encrypt and authenticate the existing data stream. Automated software, such as a virtual PBX, may eliminate the need of personnel to greet and switch incoming calls. Regulatory and legal issues As the popularity of VoIP grows, governments are becoming more interested in regulating VoIP in a manner similar to PSTN services. Throughout the developing world, particularly in countries where regulation is weak or captured by the dominant operator, restrictions on the use of VoIP are often imposed, including in Panama where VoIP is taxed, Guyana where VoIP is prohibited. In Ethiopia, where the government is nationalising telecommunication service, it is a criminal offence to offer services using VoIP. The country has installed firewalls to prevent international calls being made using VoIP. These measures were taken after the popularity of VoIP reduced the income generated by the state owned telecommunication company. = Canada = In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulates telephone service, including VoIP telephony service. VoIP services operating in Canada are required to provide 9-1-1 emergency service. =European Union= In the European Union, the treatment of VoIP service providers is a decision for each national telecommunications regulator, which must use competition law to define relevant national markets and then determine whether any service provider on those national markets has \\"significant market power\\" (and so should be subject to certain obligations). A general distinction is usually made between VoIP services that function over managed networks (via broadband connections) and VoIP services that function over unmanaged networks (essentially, the Internet). The relevant EU Directive is not clearly drafted concerning obligations which can exist independently of market power (e.g., the obligation to offer access to emergency calls), and it is impossible to say definitively whether VoIP service providers of either type are bound by them. A review of the EU Directive is under way and should be complete by 2007. =Arab states of the GCC= Oman In Oman, it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services, to the extent that web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked. Violations may be punished with fines of 50,000 Omani Rial (about 130,317 US dollars), a two year prison sentence or both. In 2009, police raided 121 Internet cafes throughout the country and arrested 212 people for using or providing VoIP services. Saudi Arabia In September 2017, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on VoIPs, in an attempt to reduce operational costs and spur digital entrepreneurship. United Arab Emirates In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it is illegal to provide or use unauthorized VoIP services, to the extent that web sites of unlicensed VoIP providers have been blocked. However, some VoIPs such as Skype were allowed. In January 2018, internet service providers in UAE blocked all VoIP apps, including Skype, but permitting only 2 \\"government-approved\\" VoIP apps (C‚ÄôME and BOTIM) for a fixed rate of Dh52.50 a month for use on mobile devices, and Dh105 a month to use over a computer connected.\\" In opposition, a petition on Change.org garnered over 5000 signatures, in response to which the website was blocked in UAE. On 24 March 2020, the United Arab Emirates loosened restriction on VoIP services earlier prohibited in the country, to ease communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, popular instant messaging applications like WhatsApp, Skype, and FaceTime remained blocked from being used for voice and video calls, constricting residents to use paid services from the country‚Äôs state-owned telecom providers. =India= In India, it is legal to use VoIP, but it is illegal to have VoIP gateways inside India. This effectively means that people who have PCs can use them to make a VoIP call to any number, but if the remote side is a normal phone, the gateway that converts the VoIP call to a POTS call is not permitted by law to be inside India. Foreign based VoIP server services are illegal to use in India. In the interest of the Access Service Providers and International Long Distance Operators the Internet telephony was permitted to the ISP with restrictions. Internet Telephony is considered to be different service in its scope, nature and kind from real time voice as offered by other Access Service Providers and Long Distance Carriers. Hence the following type of Internet Telephony are permitted in India:Harish Kumar Gangwar Technical Note on Illegal International Long Distance telephone Exchange in India :(a) PC to PC; within or outside India (b) PC / a device / Adapter conforming to standard of any international agencies like- ITU or IETF etc. in India to PSTN/PLMN abroad. (c) Any device / Adapter conforming to standards of International agencies like ITU, IETF etc. connected to ISP node with static IP address to similar device / Adapter; within or outside India. (d) Except whatever is described in , no other form of Internet Telephony is permitted. (e) In India no Separate Numbering Scheme is provided to the Internet Telephony. Presently the 10 digit Numbering allocation based on E.164 is permitted to the Fixed Telephony, GSM, CDMA wireless service. For Internet Telephony the numbering scheme shall only conform to IP addressing Scheme of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Translation of E.164 number / private number to IP address allotted to any device and vice versa, by ISP to show compliance with IANA numbering scheme is not permitted. (f) The Internet Service Licensee is not permitted to have PSTN/PLMN connectivity. Voice communication to and from a telephone connected to PSTN/PLMN and following E.164 numbering is prohibited in India. =South Korea= In South Korea, only providers registered with the government are authorized to offer VoIP services. Unlike many VoIP providers, most of whom offer flat rates, Korean VoIP services are generally metered and charged at rates similar to terrestrial calling. Foreign VoIP providers encounter high barriers to government registration. This issue came to a head in 2006 when Internet service providers providing personal Internet services by contract to United States Forces Korea members residing on USFK bases threatened to block off access to VoIP services used by USFK members as an economical way to keep in contact with their families in the United States, on the grounds that the service members' VoIP providers were not registered. A compromise was reached between USFK and Korean telecommunications officials in January 2007, wherein USFK service members arriving in Korea before June 1, 2007, and subscribing to the ISP services provided on base may continue to use their US-based VoIP subscription, but later arrivals must use a Korean-based VoIP provider, which by contract will offer pricing similar to the flat rates offered by US VoIP providers.Stripes.com, Stars and Stripes: USFK deal keeps VoIP access for troops =United States= In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission requires all interconnected VoIP service providers to comply with requirements comparable to those for traditional telecommunications service providers. VoIP operators in the US are required to support local number portability; make service accessible to people with disabilities; pay regulatory fees, universal service contributions, and other mandated payments; and enable law enforcement authorities to conduct surveillance pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). Operators of \\"Interconnected\\" VoIP (fully connected to the PSTN) are mandated to provide Enhanced 911 service without special request, provide for customer location updates, clearly disclose any limitations on their E-911 functionality to their consumers, obtain affirmative acknowledgements of these disclosures from all consumers,GPO.gov, 47 C.F.R. pt. 9 (2007) and 'may not allow their customers to ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù of 911 service.' VoIP operators also receive the benefit of certain US telecommunications regulations, including an entitlement to interconnection and exchange of traffic with incumbent local exchange carriers via wholesale carriers. Providers of \\"nomadic\\" VoIP service‚Äîthose who are unable to determine the location of their users‚Äîare exempt from state telecommunications regulation. Another legal issue that the US Congress is debating concerns changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The issue in question is calls between Americans and foreigners. The National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized to tap Americans' conversations without a warrant‚Äîbut the Internet, and specifically VoIP does not draw as clear a line to the location of a caller or a call's recipient as the traditional phone system does. As VoIP's low cost and flexibility convinces more and more organizations to adopt the technology, the surveillance for law enforcement agencies becomes more difficult. VoIP technology has also increased Federal security concerns because VoIP and similar technologies have made it more difficult for the government to determine where a target is physically located when communications are being intercepted, and that creates a whole set of new legal challenges. History The early developments of packet network designs by Paul Baran and other researchers were motivated by a desire for a higher degree of circuit redundancy and network availability in the face of infrastructure failures than was possible in the circuit-switched networks in telecommunications of the mid-twentieth century. Danny Cohen first demonstrated a form of packet voice in 1973 as part of a flight simulator application, which operated across the early ARPANET. On the early ARPANET, real-time voice communication was not possible with uncompressed pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital speech packets, which had a bit rate of 64kbps, much greater than the 2.4kbps bandwidth of early modems. The solution to this problem was linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech coding data compression algorithm that was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. LPC was capable of speech compression down to 2.4kbps, leading to the first successful real- time conversation over ARPANET in 1974, between Culler-Harrison Incorporated in Goleta, California, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. LPC has since been the most widely used speech coding method. Code-excited linear prediction (CELP), a type of LPC algorithm, was developed by Manfred R. Schroeder and Bishnu S. Atal in 1985.M. R. Schroeder and B. S. Atal, \\"Code- excited linear prediction (CELP): high-quality speech at very low bit rates,\\" in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), vol. 10, pp. 937‚Äì940, 1985. LPC algorithms remain an audio coding standard in modern VoIP technology. In the following time span of about two decades, various forms of packet telephony were developed and industry interest groups formed to support the new technologies. Following the termination of the ARPANET project, and expansion of the Internet for commercial traffic, IP telephony was tested and deemed infeasible for commercial use until the introduction of VocalChat in the early 1990s and then in Feb 1995 the official release of Internet Phone (or iPhone for short) commercial software by VocalTec , based on the Audio Transceiver patent by Lior Haramaty and Alon Cohen, and followed by other VoIP infrastructure components such as telephony gateways and switching servers. Soon after it became an established area of interest in commercial labs of the major IT concerns. By the late 1990s, the first softswitches became available, and new protocols, such as H.323, MGCP and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gained widespread attention. In the early 2000s, the proliferation of high- bandwidth always-on Internet connections to residential dwellings and businesses, spawned an industry of Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs). The development of open-source telephony software, such as Asterisk PBX, fueled widespread interest and entrepreneurship in voice-over-IP services, applying new Internet technology paradigms, such as cloud services to telephony. In 1999, a discrete cosine transform (DCT) audio data compression algorithm called the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) was adopted for the Siren codec, used in the G.722.1 wideband audio coding standard. The same year, the MDCT was adapted into the LD-MDCT speech coding algorithm, used for the AAC-LD format and intended for significantly improved audio quality in VoIP applications. MDCT has since been widely used in VoIP applications, such as the G.729.1 wideband codec introduced in 2006, Apple's Facetime (using AAC-LD) introduced in 2010, the CELT codec introduced in 2011,Presentation of the CELT codec by Timothy B. Terriberry (65 minutes of video, see also presentation slides in PDF) the Opus codec introduced in 2012, and WhatsApp's voice calling feature introduced in 2015. =Milestones= * 1966: Linear predictive coding (LPC) proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). * 1973: Packet voice application by Danny Cohen. * 1974: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) publishes a paper entitled \\"A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection\\". * 1974: Network Voice Protocol (NVP) tested over ARPANET in August 1974, carrying barely audible 16kpbs CVSD encoded voice. * 1974: The first successful real-time conversation over ARPANET achieved using 2.4kpbs LPC, between Culler-Harrison Incorporated in Goleta, California, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. * 1977: Danny Cohen and Jon Postel of the USC Information Sciences Institute, and Vint Cerf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), agree to separate IP from TCP, and create UDP for carrying real-time traffic. * 1981: IPv4 is described in RFC 791. * 1985: The National Science Foundation commissions the creation of NSFNET. * 1985: Code-excited linear prediction (CELP), a type of LPC algorithm, developed by Manfred R.

The significance of direct connection to the CPU is avoiding the bottleneck created by the expansion bus, thus providing fast throughput. There are several local buses built into various types of computers to increase the speed of data transfer (i.e. bandwidth). Local buses for expanded memory and video boards are the most common. VESA Local Bus is an example of a local bus design. Although VL-Bus was later succeeded by AGP, it is not correct to categorize AGP as a local bus. Whereas VL-Bus operated on the CPU's memory bus at the CPU's clock speed, an AGP peripheral runs at specified clock speeds that run independently of the CPU clock (usually using a divider of the CPU clock). The concept of Local Bus was pioneered by Dado Banatao.

Clean- room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent creation. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean-room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. The term implies that the design team works in an environment that is \\"clean\\" or demonstrably uncontaminated by any knowledge of the proprietary techniques used by the competitor. Typically, a clean-room design is done by having someone examine the system to be reimplemented and having this person write a specification. This specification is then reviewed by a lawyer to ensure that no copyrighted material is included. The specification is then implemented by a team with no connection to the original examiners.  Examples  Phoenix Technologies sold its clean-room implementation of the IBM-compatible BIOS to various PC clone manufacturers. Several other PC clone companies, including Corona Data Systems, Eagle Computer, and Handwell Corporation, were successfully sued by IBM for copyright infringement in 1984, and were forced to re-implement their BIOS in a way which did not infringe IBM's copyrights. These three settlements happened before Phoenix announced in July of that year that they were licensing their own BIOS code, expressly emphasizing the clean-room process through which Phoenix's BIOS code had been written by a programmer who did not even have prior exposure to Intel microprocessors, himself having been a TMS9900 programmer beforehand. As late as the early 1990s, IBM was winning millions of dollars from settling BIOS copyright infringement lawsuits against some other PC clone manufacturers like Matsushita/Panasonic (1987) and Kyocera (1993‚Äì1994), although the latter suit was for infringements between 1985 and 1990. Another clean-room design example is VTech's successful clones of the Apple II ROMs for the Laser 128, the only computer model among dozens of Apple II compatibles which survived litigation brought by Apple Computer. Other examples include ReactOS, an open source operating system made from clean-room reverse-engineered components of Windows, and Coherent operating system, a clean room re-implementation of version 7 Unix. In the early years of its existence, Coherent's developer Mark Williams Company received a visit from an AT&T; delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&T; Unix property. It has been released as open source.  Case law  Clean room design is usually employed as best practice, but not strictly required by law. In NEC Corp. v Intel Corp. (1990), NEC sought declaratory judgment against Intel's charges that NEC's engineers simply copied the microcode of the 8086 processor in their NEC V20 clone. A US judge ruled that while the early, internal revisions of NEC's microcode were indeed a copyright violation, the later one, which actually went into NEC's product, although derived from the former, were sufficiently different from the Intel microcode it could be considered free of copyright violations. While NEC themselves did not follow a strict clean room approach in the development of their clone's microcode, during the trial, they hired an independent contractor who was only given access to specifications but ended up writing code that had certain similarities to both NEC's and Intel's code. From this evidence, the judge concluded that similarity in certain routines was a matter of functional constraints resulting from the compatibility requirements, and thus were likely free of a creative element.Jorge Contreras, Laura Handley, and Terrence Yang, \\"NEC v. Intel : Breaking New Ground in the Law of Copyright, Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, Volume 3, Spring Issue, 1990, pp. 209‚Äì222 (particularly p. 213) Although the clean room approach had been used as preventative measure in view of possible litigation before (e.g. in the Phoenix BIOS case), the NEC v. Intel case was the first time that the clean room argument was accepted in a US court trial. A related aspect worth mentioning here is that NEC did have a license for Intel's patents governing the 8086 processor.David S. Elkins, ‚ÄúNEC v. Intel: A Guide to Using \\"Clean Room\\" Procedures as Evidence‚Äù, Computer Law Journal, vol. 4, issue 10, (Winter 1990) pp. 453‚Äì481 Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation was a 1999 lawsuit which established an important precedent in regard to reverse engineering.Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation, 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000). Web Archive.org copy, Feb 28, 2007. Sony sought damages for copyright infringement over Connectix's Virtual Game Station emulator, alleging that its proprietary BIOS code had been copied into Connectix's product without permission. Sony won the initial judgment, but the ruling was overturned on appeal. Sony eventually purchased the rights to Virtual Game Station to prevent its further sale and development. This established a precedent addressing the legal implications of commercial reverse engineering efforts. During production, Connectix unsuccessfully attempted a Chinese wall approach to reverse engineer the BIOS, so its engineers disassembled the object code directly. Connectix's successful appeal maintained that the direct disassembly and observation of proprietary code was necessary because there was no other way to determine its behavior. From the ruling: > Some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than > others. Sony's BIOS lay at a distance from the core because it contains > unprotected aspects that cannot be examined without copying. The court of > appeal therefore accorded it a lower degree of protection than more > traditional literary works.  In popular culture  * In the 2014 TV show Halt and Catch Fire a key plot point from the second episode of the first season is how the fictional Cardiff Electric computer company placed an engineer, and primary character, in a clean room to reverse engineer a BIOS for their PC clone, to provide cover and protection from IBM lawsuits for a previous probably-illegal hacking of the BIOS code others at the company had performed.

Life He was born on the Danish island of Bornholm, south of Sweden. He was educated at the classical school of Frederiksborg and the University of Copenhagen, at least partially on the cost of Marie Kofoed.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon In 1828 he became reader, and in 1829 professor of Latin language and literature at Copenhagen, and in 1832 was appointed university librarian. In 1848 Madvig entered parliament as a member of the \\"Eider-Danish\\" part‚Äîthose who desired the Eider to be the boundary of the country. When this party came into power Madvig became Kultus Minister in the Cabinet of Moltke II and III, but left the cabinet on 7 December 1851 as a protest against the government's unity state program. In 1852 be became director of public instruction. Some years later, from 1856 to 1863, Madvig was president of the Danish parliament and leader of the National Liberal Party. With these brief interruptions the greater part of his life was devoted to the study and teaching of Latin and the improvement of the classical schools, of which he was chief inspector. As a critic of classical texts he was distinguished for learning and acumen. He devoted much attention to Cicero, and revolutionized the study of his philosophical writings by an edition of De Finibus (1839). Other major contributions to classical scholarship are his Emendationes Livianae (1860; 2d ed. 1877) and the papers collected in his Opuscula Academica ('Minor Academic Works') (1838) and Adversaria Critica (3 vols., 1871‚Äì84). Perhaps his most widely known works are those on Latin grammar and Greek syntax, especially his Latin grammar for schools (Eng. trans. by G Woods). In 1874 his vision began to fail, and he was forced to give up much of his work. He continued to lecture, and in 1879 he was chosen rector of the university for the sixth time. In 1880 he resigned his professorship, but went on with his work on the Roman constitution, which was completed and published before his death. In this book Madvig takes a strongly conservative standpoint and attacks Theodor Mommsen's views on Caesar's programme of reforms. It is a clear exposition, though rather too dogmatic and without sufficient regard for the views of other scholars. His last work was his autobiography, Livserindringer (published 1887). One of his textbooks, on Latin syntax, was re-issued as recently as 2001. References Further reading * Hauger, B. (1994) Johan Nicolai Madvig.

Lepidus had previously been a close ally of Julius Caesar. He was also the last Pontifex Maximus before the Roman Empire. Though he was an able military commander and proved a useful partisan of Caesar, Lepidus has always been portrayed as the least influential member of the Triumvirate. He typically appears as a marginalised figure in depictions of the events of the era, most notably in Shakespeare's plays. While some scholars have endorsed this view, others argue that the evidence is insufficient to discount the distorting effects of propaganda by his opponents, principally Cicero and, later, Augustus. Family Lepidus was the son of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul in 78), his mother may have been a daughter of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. His brother was Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (consul in 50). His father was the first leader of the revived populares faction after the death of Sulla, and led an unsuccessful rebellion against the optimates in 78-77 (he was defeated just outside of Rome and fled to Sardinia where he died in 77). Lepidus married Junia Secunda, half-sister of Marcus Junius Brutus and sister of Marcus Junius Silanus, Junia Prima and Junia Tertia, Cassius Longinus's wife. Lepidus and Junia Secunda had at least one child, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger. Biography =Ally of Caesar= One of the coins minted by Lepidus, celebrating his family's achievements. This depicts the Basilica Aemilia. Lepidus joined the College of Pontiffs as a child. He started his cursus honorum as triumvir monetalis, overseeing the minting of coins, from c. 62 to 58 BC. Lepidus soon became one of Julius Caesar's greatest supporters. He was appointed as a praetor in 49 BC, being placed in charge of Rome while Caesar defeated Pompey in Greece.Holland, Tom, Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic, Abacus, 2004, , 316. He secured Caesar's appointment as dictator, a position Caesar used to get himself elected as consul, resigning the dictatorship after eleven days. Lepidus was rewarded with the position of proconsul in the Spanish province of Hispania Citerior. While in Spain Lepidus was called upon to act to quell a rebellion against Quintus Cassius Longinus, governor of neighbouring Hispania Ulterior. Lepidus refused to support Cassius, who had created opposition to Caesar's regime by his corruption and avarice. He negotiated a deal with the rebel leader, the quaestor Marcellus, and helped defeat an attack by the Mauretanian king Bogud. Cassius and his supporters were allowed to leave and order was restored. Caesar and the Senate were sufficiently impressed by Lepidus' judicial mixture of negotiation and surgical military action that they granted him a triumph. Lepidus was rewarded with the consulship in 46 after the defeat of the Pompeians in the East. Caesar also made Lepidus magister equitum (\\"Master of the Horse\\"), effectively his deputy.Holland, Rubicon, 346. Caesar appears to have had greater confidence in Lepidus than in Mark Antony to keep order in Rome, after Antony's inflammatory actions led to disturbances in 47. Lepidus appears to have been genuinely shocked when Antony provocatively offered Caesar a crown at the Lupercalia festival, an act that helped to precipitate the conspiracy to kill Caesar.Lepidus was probably sitting next to Caesar at the time. According to Cicero, he groaned, turned away and had tears in his eyes. See Weigel, Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir, p. 40. When in February 44 Caesar was elected dictator for life by the Senate, he made Lepidus magister equitum for the second time. The brief alliance in power of Caesar and Lepidus came to a sudden end when Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 (the Ides of March). Caesar had dined at Lepidus' house the night before his murder. One of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, Gaius Cassius Longinus, had argued for the killing of Lepidus and Mark Antony as well, but Marcus Junius Brutus had overruled him, saying the action was an execution and not a political coup.Holland, Rubicon, 347. =Aftermath of Caesar's death= Narbonese Gaul (\\"Narbonensis\\") and Cisalpine Gaul (\\"Gallia Cisalpina\\"). After Munda, Antony retreated towards Lepidus's territory to join up with him. As soon as Lepidus learned of Caesar's murder, he acted decisively to maintain order by moving troops to the Campus Martius.Weigel Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir p.43 He proposed using his army to punish Caesar's killers, but was dissuaded by Antony and Aulus Hirtius.John Hazel, Who's Who in the Roman World, Routledge, London, 2001, p.165. Lepidus and Antony both spoke in the Senate the following day, accepting an amnesty for the assassins in return for preservation of their offices and Caesar's reforms. Lepidus also obtained the post of Pontifex Maximus. At this point Pompey's surviving son Sextus Pompey tried to take advantage of the turmoil to threaten Spain. Lepidus was sent to negotiate with him. Lepidus successfully negotiated an agreement with Sextus that maintained the peace. The senate voted him a public thanksgiving festival.Weigel Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir p.50 Lepidus thereafter administered both Hispania and Narbonese Gaul. When Antony attempted to take control of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) by force and displace Decimus Brutus, the Senate, led by Cicero, called on Lepidus to support Brutus ‚Äì one of Caesar's killers. Lepidus prevaricated, recommending negotiation with Antony. After Antony's defeat at the Battle of Mutina, the Senate sent word that Lepidus' troops were no longer needed. Antony, however, marched towards Lepidus's province with his remaining forces. Lepidus continued to assure the Senate of his loyalty, but engaged in negotiations with Antony. When the two armies met, large portions of Lepidus's forces joined up with Antony. Lepidus negotiated an agreement with him, while claiming to the Senate that he had no choice. It is unclear whether Lepidus' troops forced him to join with Antony, whether that was always Lepidus's plan, or whether he arranged matters to gauge the situation and make the best deal.Weigel Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir pp. 59‚Äì62. =Second Triumvirate= Antony and Lepidus now had to deal with Octavian Caesar, Caesar's great-nephew and who had been adopted by Caesar in Caesar's will. Octavian was the only surviving commander of the forces that had defeated Antony at Mutina (modern Modena). The Senate instructed Octavian to hand over control of the troops to Decimus Brutus, but he refused. Antony and Lepidus met with Octavian on an island in a river, possibly near Mutina but more likely near Bologna, their armies lined along opposite banks.Holland, Rubicon, 360. They formed the Second Triumvirate, legalized with the name of Triumvirs for Confirming the Republic with Consular Power (Triumviri Rei Publicae Constituendae Consulari Potestate) by the Lex Titia of 43. With the triumvirs in possession of overwhelming numerical superiority, Decimus Brutus' remaining forces melted away, leaving the triumvirs in complete control of the western provinces. Unlike the First Triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, this one was formally constituted. In effect, it sidelined the consuls and the Senate and signalled the death of the Republic. The triumvirate's legal lifespan was for five years. At the beginning Lepidus was confirmed in possession of both the provinces of Hispania, along with Narbonese Gaul, but also agreed to hand over seven of his legions to Octavian and Antony to continue the struggle against Brutus and Cassius, who controlled the eastern part of Roman territory. In the event of a defeat, Lepidus' territories would provide a fall-back position. Lepidus was to become consul and was confirmed as Pontifex Maximus. He would assume control of Rome while they were away. According to Lepidus's biographer Richard D. Weigel, Lepidus' willingness to give up his legions inevitably consigned him to a subsidiary role in the triumvirate. Lepidus also agreed to the proscriptions that led to the death of Cicero and other die-hard opponents of Caesar's faction. Later historians were particularly critical of him for agreeing to the death of his brother Lucius Paullus, a supporter of Cicero. However, Cassius Dio hints that Lepidus helped Paullus to escape. =After Philippi= Aureus of Lepidus, c. 42 BC After the pacification of the east and the defeat of the assassins' faction in the Battle of Philippi, during which he remained in Rome, Antony and Octavian took over most of Lepidus' territories, but granted him rights in the provinces of Numidia and Africa. For a while he managed to distance himself from the frequent quarrels between his colleagues Antony and Octavian. When the Perusine War broke out in 41, Octavian tasked Lepidus with the defence of Rome against Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's brother. Lucius, with superior forces, easily took the city. Lepidus was forced to flee to Octavian's camp. Lucius soon withdrew from Rome and Octavian retook the city. After this Lepidus was given six of Antony's legions to govern Africa. In 37 BC the treaty of Tarentum formally renewed the Triumvirate for another five years. During Lepidus' governorship of Africa he promoted the distribution of land to veterans, possibly in order to build up a network of clients. He appears to have encouraged the Romanisation of Thibilis in Numidia and to have demolished illicit extensions to Carthage so that the formally cursed area of the old city, destroyed after the Third Punic War, was not built upon. =Fall from power= In 36, during the Sicilian revolt, Lepidus raised a large army of 14 legions to help subdue Sextus Pompey. However, this was to lead to an ill- judged political move that gave Octavian the excuse he needed to remove Lepidus from power. After the defeat of Sextus Pompey, Lepidus had stationed his legions in Sicily and a dispute arose over whether he or Octavian had authority on the island. Lepidus had been the first to land troops in Sicily and had captured several of the main towns. However, he felt that Octavian was treating him as a subordinate rather than an equal.Weigel, Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir, pp. 88‚Äì9 He asserted that Sicily should be absorbed into his sphere of influence. After negotiation, he suggested an alternative: Octavian could have Sicily and Africa, if he agreed to give Lepidus back his old territories in Spain and Gaul, which should legally have been his according to the Lex Titia. Octavian accused Lepidus of attempting to usurp power and fomenting rebellion. Humiliatingly, Lepidus' legions in Sicily defected to Octavian and Lepidus himself was forced to submit to him. On 22 September 36, Lepidus was stripped of all his offices except that of Pontifex Maximus; Octavian then sent him into exile in Circeii. After the defeat of Antony in 31 BC, Lepidus' son Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor became involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Octavian, but the plot was discovered by Gaius Maecenas. The younger Lepidus was executed, but the former triumvir himself was left unmolested. His wife Junia was, however, implicated. Lepidus had to plead with his former enemy Lucius Saenius Balbinus to grant her bail.Weigel, Lepidus: The Tarnished Triumvir, p.97. Spending the rest of his life in obscurity, Lepidus was apparently allowed to return to Rome periodically to participate in Senatorial business. Octavian, now known as \\"Augustus\\", is said to have belittled him by always asking for his vote last. Lepidus died peacefully in late 13 or early 12, upon which Augustus assumed the position of Pontifex Maximus for himself; afterwards, the chief priest‚Äôs office was moved from the Regia to Augustus' palace, located on the Palatine Hill in Rome. Reputation Lepidus (right) browbeaten by Antony and Octavian. Illustration to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar by H. C. Selous. Lepidus's biographer Richard D. Weigel says that he has been typically caricatured by both ancient and modern historians as \\"weak, indecisive, fickle, disloyal and incompetent\\". Cicero condemned Lepidus for \\"wickedness and sheer folly\\" after Lepidus allowed his forces to join with Mark Antony's after Antony's initial defeat at the Battle of Mutina. Cicero also privately suggested that Lepidus' wife, Junia, had been unfaithful to him. Decimus Brutus called him a \\"weathercock\\", and Velleius Paterculus called him \\"the most fickle of mankind\\" and incapable of command.Weigel, Richard D., Lepidus: the Tarnished Triumvir, Routledge, 2002, preface. According to Cassius Dio, while Mark Antony and Octavian were away from Rome fighting Brutus and Cassius, Lepidus was nominally in control of the city, but Mark Antony's wife, Fulvia, was the real power. Dio wrote, \\"She, the mother-in‚Äëlaw of Octavian and wife of Antony, had no respect for Lepidus because of his slothfulness, and managed affairs herself, so that neither the senate nor the people transacted any business contrary to her pleasure\\".Cassius Dio.48.4.1. Such views are reflected in Shakespeare's portrayal of Lepidus in Julius Caesar in which Antony describes him as \\"a slight, unmeritable man, meant to be sent on errands\\", comparable to a donkey required to bear burdens. In Antony and Cleopatra he is portrayed as extremely gullible, asking Antony silly questions about Egypt while very drunk. Antony taunts him with an elaborately nonsensical description of a Nile crocodile. After Lepidus's fall from power, he is referred to as the \\"poor third\\" and \\"fool Lepidius\\".Shakespeare, Wiliam, Antony and Cleopatra, Cambridge university Press, 2008, Act III, scene 5. Modern writers have often been equally dismissive. Ronald Syme called him \\"a flimsy character...perfidious and despised\\". Weigel argues that these views are coloured by evidence that was in large part politically motivated, and that Lepidus's career was no more perfidious or inconsistent than that of the other major players in the power struggles at the time. L√©onie Hayne says that he acted \\"skillfully and consistently in support of Antony and (indirectly) of the Caesarian faction\\". She also argues that his power bid over Sicily was logical and justifiable.Hayne, L√©onie, \\"Lepidus' Role after the Ides of March\\", Acta Classica, 14, 1971, pp. 116‚Äì17; \\"The Defeat of Lepidus in 36 B.C.\\", Acta Classica 17, 1974, pp. 59‚Äì65. Alain Gowing has also argued that his actions in Sicily, though \\"futile\\", were no more than an \\"attempt to regain a position from which he had been unfairly thrust\\".Quoted, Weigel, p. 135. Fictional depictions Despite his role as \\"a slight, unmeritable man\\" in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and as a rambling drunk in Antony and Cleopatra, other Renaissance-era writers portrayed Lepidus in a more positive way. Caspar Br√ºlow's Latin play Caius Julius Caesar depicts Lepidus as Caesar's loyal ally, warning him against conspiracies and later planning revenge on his killers. Georges de Scud√©ry's La Mort de C√©sar portrays him in a similar light, warning Caesar, and later working closely with Antony, who refers to him as \\"sage et prudent L√©pide\\". In Pierre Corneille's Mort de Pomp√©e his is a non-speaking role, simply presented as one of Caesar's entourage of officers.Weigel, Lepidus: the Tarnished Triumvir, p.112. Lepidus appears in several 18th century French plays, such as Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon's Le Triumvirat, ou la mort de Cic√©ron, in which he attempts to save Cicero's life, and is portrayed as a conflicted figure, who respects traditional Roman values, but is unable to resist the will of his colleagues. Cicero rejects compromise, but Lepidus is too weak to do so. Voltaire's Le Triumvirat refers to Lepidus as a pawn, merely used by Antony and Octavian. Lepidus appears in a number of novels. He is the principal character of Alfred Duggan's 1958 historical novel Three's Company. As the novel's title implies, it is centered on the second triumvirate, but relates the period through the lens of Lepidus' life and experiences. According to Weigel, he becomes a kind of \\"a Don Quixote in a toga\\". The novel follows the standard portrayal of him as \\"cowardly, stupid, shying away from combat, dominated by women, and longing for someone to give him orders\\". A reviewer at the time of publication referred to Duggan's Lepidus as \\"the eternal conservative stuffed shirt without the moral strength to live by the traditional virtues he admires and pretends to possess.\\"Orville Prescott, New York Times, 13 August 13, 1958, p.25. He's portrayed as a more competent figure in W. G. Hardy's The Scarlet Mantle and The Bloodied Toga. In Allan Massie's Let the Emperor Speak, he is a weasely politician.Weigel, Lepidus: the Tarnished Triumvir, p.133. He is also mentioned in Robert Harris' Dictator, told from the perspective of Cicero's secretary Tiro. In the BBC/HBO TV series Rome, Lepidus (Ronan Vibert) is portrayed in the familiar way, as an inadequate rival for the powerhouses of Octavian and Antony. Much of his involvement in the second Triumvirate is barely mentioned in the series. No mention is made of his alliance with Antony and Caesar before the assassination. He is depicted as a general sent to defeat the weakened Antony after Mutina. His whole army immediately defects to his enemy. He appears sporadically as a barely-noticed participant in later discussions about future plans.

Circumnavigation is the complete navigation around an entire island, continent, or astronomical body (e.g. a planet or moon). This article focuses on the circumnavigation of Earth. The first recorded circumnavigation of the Earth was the Magellan-Elcano expedition, which sailed from Seville, Spain in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Since the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century, circumnavigating Earth is straightforward, usually taking days instead of years. Today, the challenge of circumnavigating Earth has shifted towards human and technological endurance, speed, and less conventional methods. Etymology The word circumnavigation is a noun formed from the verb circumnavigate, from the past participle of the Latin verb circumnavigare, from circum \\"around\\" + navigare \\"to sail\\" (see further Navigation ¬ß Etymology). Definition A person walking completely around either pole will cross all meridians, but this is not generally considered a \\"circumnavigation\\". The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a continuous loop on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a great circle, and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points antipodal to each other. In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is quasispheroidal, a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are practical difficulties in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by Ranulph Fiennes. History The first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship Victoria, between 1519 and 1522, known as the Magellan‚ÄìElcano expedition. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery, led initially by the Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan between 1519 and 1521, and then by the Spanish Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano from 1521 to 1522. The voyage started in Seville, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition discovered the Strait of Magellan, named after the fleet's captain. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way, including Guam, before arriving in the Philippines. After Magellan's death in the Philippines in 1521, Elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the Indian Ocean, round the Cape of Good Hope, north along the Atlantic Ocean, and back to Spain in 1522. Elcano and a small group of 18 men were the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation. It is not generally accepted that Magellan and some crew members (possibly some other Portuguese and the Malay-Sumatrese Enrique of Malacca, who survived to the Philippines and Borneo) previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages, since Sumatra and Malacca (where Magellan had been twice before, in 1509 and in 1511‚Äì1512) lie southwest of Cebu (Philippines). If he had also been in the Moluccas islands (located southeast of Cebu) in early 1512 (dubious and controversial), he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of Earth in longitude‚Äîthough one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point. However, traveling west from Europe, in 1521, Magellan reached a region of Southeast Asia (in the Malay Archipelago), which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east. Magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history. Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800, Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay In 1577, Elizabeth I sent Francis Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard Pelican, which he renamed Golden Hind mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed south of Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip of South America, through Drake Passage or Sea of Hoces as it is known today. Wagner, Henry R., Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain's northernmost claim in Alta California, which is known as Drakes Bay, California. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in September 1580, becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation. For the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by Ulysses S. Grant, became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan‚ÄìElcano expedition, quicker and safer. Nautical The nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran IDEC 3. The record was established by six sailors: Francis Joyon, Alex Pella, Cl√©ment Surtel, Gw√©nol√© Gahinet, S√©bastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm; who wrote themselves into history books on 26 January 2017, by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds. The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction. =Wind powered= The route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation, via the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow. The map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a sailing circumnavigation of the world by the trade winds and the Suez and Panama canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a great circle, and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many cruising sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds. The route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow. In yacht racing, a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600 nautical miles (40,000 km) in length which crosses the equator, crosses every meridian and finishes in the same port as it starts. The second map on the right shows the route of the Vend√©e Globe round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for square-rig vessels due to the square rig's dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern Bermuda rig. For around the world sailing records, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600 nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63¬∞S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track. The equator must be crossed. The solo wind powered circumnavigation record of 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds was established by Fran√ßois Gabart on the maxi-multihull sailing yacht MACIF and completed on 7 December 2017.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42383438 The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction. =Mechanically powered= Since the advent of world cruises in 1922, by Cunard's Laconia, thousands of people have completed circumnavigations of the globe at a more leisurely pace. Typically, these voyages begin in New York City or Southampton, and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around Cape Horn. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around Cape of Good Hope and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began. The current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minuteshttps://www.uimpowerboating.com/Records1.aspx was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran Earthrace which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction. Aviation The first aerial circumnavigation of the planet was flown in 1924 by aviators of the U.S. Army Air Service in a quartet of Douglas World Cruiser biplanes. Since the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as Pan American Flight One (and later United Airlines Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple. The first lighter-than-air aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the rigid airship LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, which did so in 1929. Aviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the jet streams, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record. Thus, for example, Steve Fossett's global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere. For powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least long (which is approximately the length of the Tropic of Cancer). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the Arctic and Antarctic circles. In ballooning, which is totally at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed. The course must cross all meridians, and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles, chosen by the pilot, having radii of and enclosing the poles (though not necessarily centred on them). Astronautics The first person to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, also became the first person to complete an orbital spaceflight in the Vostok 1 spaceship within 2 hours in 1961.NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive Flight started at 63¬∞ E and ended 45¬∞ E longitude; thus Gagarin did not circumnavigate Earth completely. Gherman Titov in the Vostok 2 was the first human to circumnavigate Earth in spaceflight and made 17.5 orbits. Human- powered According to adjudicating bodies Guinness World Records and Explorersweb, Jason Lewis completed the first human-powered circumnavigation of the globe on 6 October 2007. This was part of a thirteen-year journey entitled Expedition 360. In 2012, Turkish-born American adventurer Erden Eru√ß completed the first entirely solo human-powered circumnavigation, travelling by rowboat, sea kayak, foot and bicycle from 10 July 2007 to 21 July 2012, crossing the equator twice, passing over 12 antipodal points, and logging in 1,026 days of travel time, excluding breaks. National Geographic lists Colin Angus as being the first to complete a global circumnavigation. However, his journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of Guinness World Records and AdventureStats by Explorersweb. People have both bicycled and run around the world, but the oceans have had to be covered by air or sea travel, making the distance shorter than the Guinness guidelines. To go from North America to Asia on foot is theoretically possible but very difficult. It involves crossing the Bering Strait on the ice, and around of roadless swamped or freezing cold areas in Alaska and eastern Russia. No one has so far travelled all of this route by foot. David Kunst was the first verified person to walk around the world between 20 June 1970 and 5 October 1974.

A buildup of static electricity can be caused by tribocharging or by electrostatic induction. The ESD occurs when differently- charged objects are brought close together or when the dielectric between them breaks down, often creating a visible spark. ESD can create spectacular electric sparks (lightning, with the accompanying sound of thunder, is a large-scale ESD event), but also less dramatic forms which may be neither seen nor heard, yet still be large enough to cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. Electric sparks require a field strength above approximately 40 kV/cm in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Other forms of ESD include corona discharge from sharp electrodes and brush discharge from blunt electrodes. ESD can cause harmful effects of importance in industry, including explosions in gas, fuel vapor and coal dust, as well as failure of solid state electronics components such as integrated circuits. These can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages. Electronics manufacturers therefore establish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to prevent charging, such as avoiding highly charging materials and measures to remove static such as grounding human workers, providing antistatic devices, and controlling humidity. ESD simulators may be used to test electronic devices, for example with a human body model or a charged device model.  Causes  One of the causes of ESD events is static electricity. Static electricity is often generated through tribocharging, the separation of electric charges that occurs when two materials are brought into contact and then separated. Examples of tribocharging include walking on a rug, rubbing a plastic comb against dry hair, rubbing a balloon against a sweater, ascending from a fabric car seat, or removing some types of plastic packaging. In all these cases, the breaking of contact between two materials results in tribocharging, thus creating a difference of electrical potential that can lead to an ESD event. Another cause of ESD damage is through electrostatic induction. This occurs when an electrically charged object is placed near a conductive object isolated from the ground. The presence of the charged object creates an electrostatic field that causes electrical charges on the surface of the other object to redistribute. Even though the net electrostatic charge of the object has not changed, it now has regions of excess positive and negative charges. An ESD event may occur when the object comes into contact with a conductive path. For example, charged regions on the surfaces of styrofoam cups or bags can induce potential on nearby ESD sensitive components via electrostatic induction and an ESD event may occur if the component is touched with a metallic tool. ESD can also be caused by energetic charged particles impinging on an object. This causes increasing surface and deep charging. This is a known hazard for most spacecraft.Henry B. Garrett and Albert C. Whittlesey: Spacecraft charging, an update; IEEE Trans. Plasma Science, 28(6), 2000.  Types  The most spectacular form of ESD is the spark, which occurs when a heavy electric field creates an ionized conductive channel in air. This can cause minor discomfort to people, severe damage to electronic equipment, and fires and explosions if the air contains combustible gases or particles. However, many ESD events occur without a visible or audible spark. A person carrying a relatively small electric charge may not feel a discharge that is sufficient to damage sensitive electronic components. Some devices may be damaged by discharges as small as 30 V. These invisible forms of ESD can cause outright device failures, or less obvious forms of degradation that may affect the long term reliability and performance of electronic devices. The degradation in some devices may not become evident until well into their service life. = Sparks = A spark is triggered when the electric field strength exceeds approximately 4‚Äì30 kV/cmCRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (PDF) ‚Äî the dielectric field strength of air. This may cause a very rapid increase in the number of free electrons and ions in the air, temporarily causing the air to abruptly become an electrical conductor in a process called dielectric breakdown. Lightning over Ryma≈Ñ. Northern Poland. Perhaps the best known example of a natural spark is lightning. In this case the electric potential between a cloud and ground, or between two clouds, is typically hundreds of millions of volts. The resulting current that cycles through the stroke channel causes an enormous transfer of energy. On a much smaller scale, sparks can form in air during electrostatic discharges from charged objects that are charged to as little as 380 V (Paschen's law). Earth's atmosphere consists of 21% oxygen (O2) and 78% nitrogen (N2). During an electrostatic discharge, such as a lightning flash, the affected atmospheric molecules become electrically overstressed. The diatomic oxygen molecules are split, and then recombine to form ozone (O3), which is unstable, or reacts with metals and organic matter. If the electrical stress is high enough, nitrogen oxides (NOx) can form. Both products are toxic to animals, and nitrogen oxides are essential for nitrogen fixation. Ozone attacks all organic matter by ozonolysis and is used in water purification. Sparks are an ignition source in combustible environments that may lead to catastrophic explosions in concentrated fuel environments. Most explosions can be traced back to a tiny electrostatic discharge, whether it was an unexpected combustible fuel leak invading a known open air sparking device, or an unexpected spark in a known fuel rich environment. The end result is the same if oxygen is present and the three criteria of the fire triangle have been combined.  Damage prevention in electronics  A portion of a static discharger on an aircraft. Note the two sharp 3/8\\" metal micropoints and the protective yellow plastic. Many electronic components, especially integrated circuits and microchips, can be damaged by ESD. Sensitive components need to be protected during and after manufacture, during shipping and device assembly, and in the finished device. Grounding is especially important for effective ESD control. It should be clearly defined, and regularly evaluated. =Protection during manufacturing= In manufacturing, prevention of ESD is based on an Electrostatic Discharge Protected Area (EPA). The EPA can be a small workstation or a large manufacturing area. The main principle of an EPA is that there are no highly-charging materials in the vicinity of ESD sensitive electronics, all conductive and dissipative materials are grounded, workers are grounded, and charge build-up on ESD sensitive electronics is prevented. International standards are used to define a typical EPA and can be found for example from International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ESD prevention within an EPA may include using appropriate ESD-safe packing material, the use of conductive filaments on garments worn by assembly workers, conducting wrist straps and foot-straps to prevent high voltages from accumulating on workers' bodies, anti-static mats or conductive flooring materials to conduct harmful electric charges away from the work area, and humidity control. Humid conditions prevent electrostatic charge generation because the thin layer of moisture that accumulates on most surfaces serves to dissipate electric charges. Ionizers are used especially when insulative materials cannot be grounded. Ionization systems help to neutralize charged surface regions on insulative or dielectric materials. Insulating materials prone to triboelectric charging of more than 2,000 V should be kept away at least 12 inches from sensitive devices to prevent accidental charging of devices through field induction. On aircraft, static dischargers are used on the trailing edges of wings and other surfaces. Manufacturers and users of integrated circuits must take precautions to avoid ESD. ESD prevention can be part of the device itself and include special design techniques for device input and output pins. External protection components can also be used with circuit layout. Due to dielectric nature of electronics component and assemblies, electrostatic charging cannot be completely prevented during handling of devices. Most of ESD sensitive electronic assemblies and components are also so small that manufacturing and handling is done with automated equipment. ESD prevention activities are therefore important with those processes where components come into direct contact with equipment surfaces. In addition, it is important to prevent ESD when an electrostatic discharge sensitive component is connected with other conductive parts of the product itself. An efficient way to prevent ESD is to use materials that are not too conductive but will slowly conduct static charges away. These materials are called static dissipative and have resistivity values below 1012 ohm-meters. Materials in automated manufacturing which will touch on conductive areas of ESD sensitive electronic should be made of dissipative material, and the dissipative material must be grounded. These special materials are able to conduct electricity, but do so very slowly. Any built-up static charges dissipate without the sudden discharge that can harm the internal structure of silicon circuits. =Protection during transit= A network card inside an antistatic bag, a bag made of a partially conductive plastic that acts as a Faraday cage, shielding the card from ESD. Sensitive devices need to be protected during shipping, handling, and storage. The buildup and discharge of static can be minimized by controlling the surface resistance and volume resistivity of packaging materials. Packaging is also designed to minimize frictional or triboelectric charging of packs due to rubbing together during shipping, and it may be necessary to incorporate electrostatic or electromagnetic shielding in the packaging material.GR-1421, Generic Requirements for ESD-[https://newtophome.info/best-power-strips/ Protective Circuit Pack Containers], Telcordia. A common example is that semiconductor devices and computer components are usually shipped in an antistatic bag made of a partially conductive plastic, which acts as a Faraday cage to protect the contents against ESD. Simulation and testing for electronic devices Electric discharge showing the ribbon-like plasma filaments from multiple discharges from a Tesla coil. For testing the susceptibility of electronic devices to ESD from human contact, an ESD Simulator with a special output circuit, called the human body model (HBM) is often used. This consists of a capacitor in series with a resistor. The capacitor is charged to a specified high voltage from an external source, and then suddenly discharged through the resistor into an electrical terminal of the device under test. One of the most widely used models is defined in the JEDEC 22-A114-B standard, which specifies a 100 picofarad capacitor and a 1,500 ohm resistor. Other similar standards are MIL-STD-883 Method 3015, and the ESD Association's ESD STM5.1. For comportment to European Union standards for Information Technology Equipment, the IEC/EN 61000-4-2 test specification is used. Another specification (Schaffner) C = 150 pF R = 330 Œ© that gives high fidelity results. Mostly the theory is there, minimum of the companies measure the real ESD survival rate. Guidelines and requirements are given for test cell geometries, generator specifications, test levels, discharge rate and waveform, types and points of discharge on the \\"victim\\" product, and functional criteria for gauging product survivability. A charged device model (CDM) test is used to define the ESD a device can withstand when the device itself has an electrostatic charge and discharges due to metal contact. This discharge type is the most common type of ESD in electronic devices and causes most of the ESD damages in their manufacturing. CDM discharge depends mainly on parasitic parameters of the discharge and strongly depends on size and type of component package. One of the most widely used CDM simulation test models is defined by the JEDEC. Other standardized ESD test circuits include the machine model (MM) and transmission line pulse (TLP).

The constitution of the Roman Republic was a complex set of checks and balances designed to prevent a man from rising above the rest and creating a monarchy. In order to bypass these constitutional obstacles, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus forged a secret alliance in which they promised to use their respective influence to help each other. According to Goldsworthy, the alliance was \\"not at heart a union of those with the same political ideals and ambitions\\", but one where \\"all [were] seeking personal advantage.\\" As the nephew of Gaius Marius, Caesar was at the time very well connected with the Populares faction, which pushed for social reforms. He was moreover Pontifex Maximus‚Äîthe chief priest in the Roman religion‚Äîand could significantly influence politics, notably through the interpretation of the auspices. Pompey was the greatest military leader of the time, having notably won the wars against Sertorius (80‚Äì72 BC), Mithridates (73‚Äì63 BC), and the Cilician Pirates (66 BC). Although he won the war against Spartacus (73‚Äì71 BC), Crassus was mostly known for his fabulous wealth, which he acquired through intense land speculation. Both Pompey and Crassus also had extensive patronage networks. The alliance was cemented with the marriage of Pompey with Caesar's daughter Julia in 59 BC. Thanks to this alliance, Caesar thus received an extraordinary command over Gaul and Illyria for five years, so he could start his conquest of Gaul. In 56 BC the Triumvirate was renewed at the Lucca Conference, in which the triumvirs agreed to share the Roman provinces between them; Caesar could keep Gaul for another five years, while Pompey received Hispania, and Crassus Syria. The latter embarked into an expedition against the Parthians to match Caesar's victories in Gaul, but died in the disastrous defeat of Carrhae in 53 BC. The death of Crassus ended the Triumvirate, and left Caesar and Pompey facing each other; their relationship had already degraded after the death of Julia in 54 BC. Pompey then sided with the Optimates, the conservative faction opposed to the Populares‚Äîsupported by Caesar‚Äîand actively fought Caesar in the senate. In 49 BC, with the conquest of Gaul complete, Caesar refused to release his legions and instead invaded Italy from the north by crossing the Rubicon with his army. The following civil war eventually led to Caesar's victory over Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC and the latter's assassination in Ptolemaic Egypt where he fled after the battle. In 44 BC Caesar was assassinated in Rome and the following year his adopted son Octavian (later known as Augustus) formed the Second Triumvirate with Marcus Antonius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Background In the background of the formation of this alliance were the frictions between two political factions of the Late Republic, the populares and optimates. The former drew support from the plebeians (the commoners, the majority of the population). Consequently, they espoused policies addressing the problems of the urban poor and promoted reforms that would help them, particularly redistribution of land for the landless poor and farm and debt relief. It also challenged the power the nobiles (the aristocracy) exerted over Roman politics through the senate, which was the body that represented its interests. The Optimates were an anti-reform conservative faction that favoured the nobles, and also wanted to limit the power of the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) and strengthen the power of the senate. Julius Caesar was a leading figure of the populares. The origin of the process that led to Caesar seeking the alliance with Pompey and Crassus traces back to the Second Catilinarian conspiracy, which occurred three years earlier in 63 BC when Marcus Tullius Cicero was one of the two consuls. A Roman bust of Marcus Tullius Cicero, depicted here at about age sixty, in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain In 66 BC Catiline, the leader of the plot, presented his candidacy for the consulship, but he was charged with extortion and his candidacy was disallowed because he announced it too late.Sallust, The War with Catiline, 18.3 In 65 BC he was brought to trial along with other men who had carried out killings during the proscriptions (persecutions) of Lucius Cornelius Sulla when the dictator had declared many of his political opponents enemies of the state (81 BC).Cassius Dio, The Roman History, 10.3 He received the support of many prominent men and he was acquitted through bribery.Cicero, Pro Caelio IVCicero, Commentariolum Petitionis, 3 In 63 BC Catiline was a candidate for the consulship again. He presented himself as the champion of debtors.Tatum, J. W., The final Crisis (69‚Äì44), p.195Sallust, The War with Catiline, 24.3 Catiline was defeated again and Marcus Tullius Cicero and Gaius Antonius Hybrida were elected. He plotted a coup d'√©tat together with a group of fellow aristocrats and disaffected veterans as a means of preserving his dignitas.In a letter to Catullus, Catiline wrote: \\"I have pursued a course of action that offers hope of preserving of what remains of my prestige (dignitas)\\" Sallust, The War with Catiline, 35.4 One of the conspirators, Gaius Manlius, assembled an army in Etruria and civil unrest was prepared in various parts of Italy. Catiline was to lead the conspiracy in Rome, which would have involved arson and the murder of senators. He was then to join Manlius in a march on Rome. The plot was to start with the murder of Cicero. Cicero discovered this, exposed the conspiracy, and produced evidence for the arrest of five conspirators. He had them executed without trial with the backing of a final decree of the Senate ‚Äì a decree the senate issued at times of emergency.Senatus consultum ultimum in modern terminology, senatus consultum de res publica defendenda, (decree of the Senate about defending the Republic) in the terminology used by the Romans.Tatum, J. W., The final Crisis (69‚Äì44), p.195-6 This was done because it was feared that the arrested men might be freed by other plotters. Julius Caesar opposed this measure. When Catiline heard of this he led his forces in Pistoria (Pistoia) with the intention of escaping to northern Italy. He was engaged in battle and defeated.Sallust, The War with Catiline,20‚Äì61 The summary executions were an expedient to discourage further violence. However, this measure, an unprecedented assertion of senatorial power over the life and death of Roman citizens, backfired for the optimates. It was seen by some as a violation of the right to a trial and led to charge of repressive governance, and gave the populares ammunition with which to challenge the notion of aristocratic dominance in politics and the prestige of the senate. Cicero's speeches in favour of the supremacy of the senate made matters worse. In 63 BC the plebeian tribunes Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos Iunior and Calpurnius Bestia, supported by Caesar, sharply criticized Cicero, who came close to being tried. The senate was also attacked on the ground that it did not have the right to condemn any citizens without a trial before the people.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.42 Caesar, who was a praetor, proposed that Catullus, a prominent optimate, be relieved from restoring the temple of Jupiter and that the job be given to Pompey. Metellus Nepos proposed a law to recall Pompey to Italy to restore order. Pompey was away commanding the final phase of the Third Mithridatic War (73‚Äì63 BC) in the east. Nepos was strongly opposed by Cato the Younger, who in that year was a plebeian tribune and a staunch optimate. The dispute came close to violence; Nepos had armed some of his men. According to Plutarch, the senate announced the intention to issue a final decree to remove Nepos from his office but Cato opposed it.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Cato the younger, 27‚Äì29.1‚Äì2 Nepos went to Asia to inform Pompey about the events, even though, as a plebeian tribune, he had no right to be absent from the city.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.43 Tatum maintains that Nepos leaving the city even though plebeian tribunes were not allowed to do so was 'a gesture demonstrating the senate's violation of the tribunate.'Tatum, J. W., The final Crisis (69‚Äì44), p.198 Caesar also brought a motion to have Pompey recalled to deal with the emergency. Suetonius wrote that Caesar was suspended by a final decree. At first Caesar refused to stand down, but he retired to his home when he heard that some people were ready to coerce him by force of arms. The next day the people demonstrated in favour of his reinstatement and were becoming riotous, but Caesar \\"held them in check.\\" The senate thanked him publicly, rescinded the decree and reinstated him.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 16 The actions of both men intensified the accusations of illegal actions by Cicero and the senate, were seen as a gesture of friendship towards Pompey, and attracted the sympathy of his supporters. Caesar and Nepos forced the senate to play the role of Pompey's opponent and to resort to threaten (in one case) and use (in the other case) a final decree again ‚Äì the measure whose repressive nature was at the centre of the dispute - thereby exposing it to further charges of tyranny. Public opinion was sensitive to threats to the people's freedom and Cicero's standing deteriorated.Mitchell, T. N., Cicero, Pompey, and the Rise of the First Triumvirate, Traditio, Vol. 29 (1973), pp. 3‚Äì7 A Roman bust of Pompey the Great made during the reign of Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD), a copy of an original bust from 70-60 BC, Venice National Archaeological Museum, Italy In 62 BC Pompey returned to Italy after winning the Third Mithridatic War against Pontus and Armenia (in present-day eastern Turkey) and annexing Syria. He wanted the senate to ratify the acts of the settlements he had made with the kings and cities in the region en bloc. He was opposed by the optimates led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who carried the day in the senate with the support of Cato the Younger.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pompey, 49.3 Pompey had taken over the command of the last phase of that war from Lucullus, who felt that he should have been allowed to continue the war and win it. Moreover, when he took over the command of the war Pompey ignored the settlements Lucullus had already made. Lucullus demanded that Pompey should render account for each act individually and separately instead of asking for the approval of all his acts at once in a single vote as if they were the acts of a master. The character of the acts was not known. Each act should be scrutinised, and the senators should ratify those that suited the senate.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.49, 50.1 Appian thought that the optimates, particularly Lucullus, were motivated by jealousy. Crassus cooperated with Lucullus on this matter.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.9 Plutarch wrote that when Lucullus returned to Rome after being relieved from his command the senate hoped that it would find in him an opponent of the tyranny of Pompey and a champion of the aristocracy. However, he withdrew from public affairs. Those who looked on the power of Pompey with suspicion made Crassus and Cato the champions of the senatorial party when Lucullus declined the leadership.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Lucullus, 38.2, 42.5 Plutarch also wrote that Pompey asked the senate to postpone the consular elections so that he could be in Rome to help Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus to canvass for his candidacy, but Cato swayed the senate to reject this. Plutarch also noted that according to some sources since Cato was the major stumbling block for his ambitions, he asked for the hand of Cato's elder niece for himself and the hand of the younger one, whereas according to other sources he asked for the hand of Cato's daughters. The women were happy with this because of Pompey's high repute, but Cato thought that this was aimed at bribing him by means of a marriage alliance and refused.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Cato Minor, 30.1‚Äì4, The Life of Pompey, 44.2‚Äì3 In 60 BC, Pompey sponsored an agrarian bill proposed by the plebeian tribune Flavius that provided for distribution of public land. It included land that had been forfeited but not allotted by Lucius Cornelius Sulla when he distributed land to settle his veterans in 80 BC and holdings in Arretium (Arezzo) and Volaterrae (Volterra), both in Etruria. Land was to be purchased with the new revenues from the provinces for the next five years. The optimates opposed the bill because it suspected that 'some novel power for Pompey was aimed at.'Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 1.19.4 They were led by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, one of the two consuls for that year, who contested every point of the Flavius' bill and 'attacked him so persistently that the latter had him put in prison.' Metellus Celer wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus Celer had the wall cut through to let them in. When Pompey heard this he was afraid about the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus Celer did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.49 The antics of Flavius alienated the people. As time went by they lost interest in the bill and by June the issue was 'completely cold.' Finally, a serious war in Gaul diverted attention from it.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 1.19.4 Pompey had managed to support the election of Lucius Afranius, who had been one of his commanders in the war in the east, as the other consul. However, he was unfamiliar with political maneuvering. In Cassius Dio's words he \\"understood how to dance better than to transact any business.\\"Cassius Dio, Roman History 37.49.3 In the end, lacking the support of this consul, Pompey let the matter drop.Tatum, J. W., The final Crisis (69‚Äì44), p.198 Thus, the Pompeian camp proved inadequate to respond the obstructionism of the optimates.Mitchell, T. N., Cicero, Pompey, and the Rise of the First Triumvirate, pp. 19‚Äì20 Accounts of the creation of the alliance There are several versions of how the alliance came about in the sources. =Appian's version= According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar came back from his governorship in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also wanted to be a candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city, and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up the last day of the presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‚Äòmade friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then improved relations between Crassus and Pompey and ‚Äòthese three most powerful men pooled their interests.‚Äô Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster).Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.8‚Äì9 Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than the other way round. =Plutarch's version= Plutarch clarified that those who were granted a triumph had to stay outside the city until the celebration, while candidates for the consulship had to be present in the city. The option of registering in absentia through a friend acting on his behalf was turned down and Caesar opted for the consulship. Like Appian, Plutarch wrote that Cato the Younger was the fiercest opponent of Caesar. He steered the other senators towards rejecting the proposal.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Caesar, 13.1‚Äì2 In both The Life of Cato and The Life of Pompey he wrote that after the agrarian bill was defeated, the hard pressed Pompey resorted to seeking the support of the plebeian tribunes and young adventurers, the worst of whom was Publius Clodius Pulcher (see below). In the former he added that Pompey then won the support of Caesar, who attached himself to him. In the latter he wrote that Caesar pursued a policy of conciliating Crassus and Pompey. Therefore, the two texts seem contradictory.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Cato Minor, 31.2, 4, The Life of Pompey, 46.4, 47.1 In The Life of Caesar, he wrote that Caesar started his policy to reconcile Pompey and Crassus soon after he entered the city because they were the most influential men. He told them that by concentrating their united strength on him, they could succeed in changing the form of government.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Caesar, 13.3 =Cassius Dio‚Äôs version= In Cassius Dio's account Caesar, who was governor in Hispania in 60 BC, considered his governorship as stepping-stone to the consulship. He left Hispania in a hurry, even before his successor arrived, to get to Rome in time for the elections. He sought the office before holding his triumph as it was too late to celebrate this before the elections. He was refused the triumph through Cato's opposition. Caesar didn't press the matter, thinking that he could celebrate greater exploits if he was elected consul, and so entered the city to canvass for office. He courted Crassus and Pompey so skilfully that he won them over, even though they were still hostile to each other, had their political clubs and ‚Äòeach opposed everything that he saw the other wished‚Äô.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.54 =Suetonius' version= Suetonius' account has Caesar return to Rome from Hispania hastily without even waiting for his successor because he wanted both a triumph and the consulship. As the day of the election for the consulship had already been set, he had to register his candidacy as a private citizen and had to give up his military command and his triumph. When his intrigues to obtain an exemption caused a fuss he gave up the triumph and chose the consulship. There were two other candidates for the consulship, Lucius Lucceius and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. Caesar made entreaties to the former because he was rich and could treat the electorate with largesse. The aristocracy funded Calpurnius Bibulus for his electoral canvassing because he was a staunch opponent of Caesar, and would keep him in check. Even Cato the Younger, who was a very upright man, \\"did not deny that bribery under such circumstances was for the good of the republic.\\" Bibulus was elected. Normally the new consuls were assigned important areas of military command, but, in this instance, they were assigned \\"mere woods and pastures\\"‚Äîanother measure intended to blunt Caesar's ambitions. Caesar, angry about 'this slight', tried hard to win over Pompey, who was himself aggrieved at the senate for not ratifying the settlements he made after winning the Third Mithridatic War. Caesar succeeded, patched up the relationship between Crassus and Pompey, and \\"made a compact with both of them that no step should be taken in public affairs which did not suit any one of the three.\\"Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 19.2 Suetonius's version is the only one that places the creation of the alliance after Caesar was elected. His version is also the only one that mentions the woods and pastures. Convergence of interests Ancient sources mention what brought Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what interests might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch described as a reconciliation. Cassius Dio thought that this was something that required skill‚Äîalmost as if it were a reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable than their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate. A Roman bust of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek With respect to the aristocratic circles of the optimates who wanted the supremacy of the senate over Roman politics, Pompey was an outsider. He built his political career as a military commander. He raised three legions in his native Picenum (in central Italy) to support Lucius Cornelius Sulla in retaking Rome, which had been seized by the supporters of Gaius Marius prior to Sulla's second civil war (83‚Äì82 BC). Sulla then sent him to Sicily (82 BC) and Africa (81 BC) against the Marians who had fled there, where he defeated them, thereby gaining military glory and distinction, particularly in Africa. Pompey then fought the rebellion by Quintus Sertorius in Hispania from 76 BC to 71 BC during the Sertorian War (80‚Äì71 BC). He played a part in the suppression of the slave revolt led by Spartacus (the Third Servile War, 72‚Äì70 BC). The latter two earned him the award of a consulship in 70 BC even though he was below the age of eligibility to this office and he had not climbed the cursus honorum, the political career ladder traditionally required to reach the consulship. Pompey was also given the command of a large task force to fight piracy in the Mediterranean Sea by the Gabinian law (67 BC), which gave him extraordinary powers over the whole of the Sea, as well as the lands within 50 miles of its coasts. In 66 BC the Manilian law handed the command of the last phase of the Third Mithridatic War over to Pompey, who brought it to a victorious conclusion. The political power of Pompey‚Äîwho spent half of his career up to 63 BC fighting outside Rome‚Äîlay outside the conservative aristocratic circles of the optimates. It was based on his popularity as a military commander, political patronage, purchase of votes for his supporters or himself, and the support of his war veterans: \\"Prestige, wealth, clients, and loyal, grateful veterans who could be readily mobilised ‚Äì these were the opes which could guarantee [Pompey's] brand of [power].\\"Mitchell, T., Cicero, Pompey and the rise of the First Triumvirate, Traditio, Vol. 29 (1973), p. 17 The opposition of the optimates to the acts of his settlements in the east and the agrarian bill he sponsored were not just due to jealousy as suggested by Appian. The optimates were also weary of the personal political clout of Pompey. They saw him as a potential challenge to the supremacy of the senate, which they largely controlled and which had been criticized for the summary executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy. They saw a politically strong man as a potential tyrant who might overthrow the republic. Pompey remained aloof with regard to the controversies between optimates and populares that raged in Rome at the time when he returned from the Third Mithridatic War in 62 BC. Whilst he did not endorse the populares, he refused to side with the senate, making vague speeches that recognised the authority of the senate, but not acknowledging the principle of senatorial supremacy advocated by Cicero and the optimates.Mitchell, T., Cicero, Pompey and the rise of the First Triumvirate, Traditio, Vol. 29 (1973), p. 17 The opposition to and defeat of the agrarian law sponsored by Pompey was more than just opposition to Pompey. Nor was the law exclusively about allotting land for the settlement of Pompey's veterans, who expected as much ever since Sulla had done likewise in 80 BC. However, the law was framed in a way that the land would be distributed to the landless urban poor as well. This would help to relieve the problem of the mass of the landless unemployed or underemployed poor in Rome, which relied on the provision of a grain dole by the state to survive, and would also make Pompey popular among the plebeians. Populares politicians had been proposing this kind land of reform since the introduction of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC, which had led to his murder. Attempts to introduce such agrarian laws since then were defeated by the optimates. Thus, the opposition to the bill sponsored by Pompey came within this wider historical context of optimate resistance to reform as well as the optimates being suspicious of Pompey. A crucial element in the defeat of the bill sponsored by Pompey was the fact what the optimates had a strong consul in Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer who vehemently and successfully resisted its enactment, while the consul sponsored by Pompey, Lucius Afranius, was ineffective. The lack of effective consular assistance had been a weakness for Pompey. As already mentioned above, Plutarch wrote that the defeat of the bill forced Pompey to seek the support of the plebeian tribunes, and thus of the populares.Plutarch Parallel Lives, The Life of Pompey, 46.4 With the return of Caesar from his governorship in Hispania, Pompey found a politician who would have the strength and clout to push the bill through if he became consul. Crassus and Pompey shared a consulship in 70 BC. Plutarch regarded this as having been dull and uneventful because it was marred by continuous disagreement between the two men. He wrote that they \\"differed on almost every measure, and by their contentiousness rendered their consulship barren politically and without achievement, except that Crassus made a great sacrifice in honour of Hercules and gave the people a great feast and an allowance of grain for three months.\\"Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 12.2 The deep enmity during this consulship was also noted by Appian.Appian, The Civil Wars, 1.121 Plutarch also wrote that Pompey gave the people back their tribunate.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Pompey, 21‚Äì23.1‚Äì2 This was a reference to the repeal of laws introduced by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 81 BC that had emasculated the power of the plebeian tribunes, by banning it from presenting bills to the vote of the plebeian council and from vetoing the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta. He also forbade those who had held this tribunate from running for public office. Sulla had done this because these tribunes had challenged the supremacy of the patrician-controlled senate and he wanted to strengthen the power of the latter. Since these tribunes were the representatives of the majority of the citizens, the people were unhappy with this. Plutarch attributed this repeal to Pompey alone. However, it is very likely that the optimates would have opposed this in the senate, making it unlikely that this measure could have been passed if the two consuls had opposed each other on this issue. Livy‚Äôs Periochae (a short summary of Livy's work) recorded that \\"Marcus Crassus and Gnaeus Pompey were made consuls ... and reconstituted the tribunician powers.\\"Livy Periochae, 97.6 Similarly, Suetonius wrote that when Caesar was a military tribune, \\"he ardently supported the leaders in the attempt to re-establish the authority of the tribunes of the commons [the plebeians], the extent of which Sulla had curtailed.\\"Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 5 The two leaders must obviously have been the two consuls, Crassus and Pompey. Therefore, on this issue there must have been unity of purpose among these three men. This was an issue of great importance to the populares. There are indications that Caesar and Crassus may have had significant political links prior to the triumvirate. Suetonius wrote that according to some sources Caesar was suspected with having conspired with Crassus, Publius Sulla, and Lucius Autronius to attack the senate house and kill many senators. Crassus was then to assume the office of dictator and have Caesar named Magister Equitum, reform the state and then restore the consulship to Sulla and Autronius. According to one of the sources from which Suetonius drew this information, Crassus pulled out at the last minute and Caesar did not go ahead with the plan.Suetonius The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 9 Plutarch did not mention these episodes in his Life of Caesar. Suetonius wrote that in 65 BC Caesar tried to get command in Egypt assigned to him by the plebeian council when Ptolemy XII, a Roman ally, was deposed by a rebellion in Alexandria, but the optimates blocked the assignment.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar,11 Plutarch did not mention this either, but in the Life of Crassus he wrote that Crassus, who in that year was a praetor, wanted to make Egypt a tributary of Rome without mentioning the rebellion. He was opposed by his colleague and both voluntarily laid down their offices.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 13.1 Hence there may have been a connection between Crassus' motion and Caesar's ambition. Plutarch wrote that when Caesar was allocated the governorship of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior for 60 BC he was in debt and his creditors prevented him from going to his province. Crassus paid off the most intransigent creditors and gave a surety of 830 talents, thereby permitting Caesar to leave. Suetonius noted this episode as well, but did not mention who made the payments and gave the surety.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar,18.1 Plutarch thought that Crassus did this because he needed Caesar for his political campaign against Pompey.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Caesar, 11.1‚Äì2 However, this cannot be taken for granted. In a speech Cicero made against an agrarian bill proposed by the plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus in 63 BC, he claimed that Rullus was an insignificant figure and a front for unsavoury 'machinators' whom he described as the real architects of the bill and as the men who had the real power and who were to be feared. He did not name these men, but he dropped hints that made them identifiable by saying, \\"Some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom nothing seems sufficient to squander.\\" Sumner points out that these were references to the popular images of Crassus and Caesar.Cicero, On the Agrarian Laws, 2.65G. V. Sumner, Cicero, Pompeius, and Rullus, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 97 (1966), p. 573 Thus, it cannot be ruled out that Crassus, Pompey and Caesar might have been willing to cooperate on a specific policy issue on which they agreed, as they had done in 70 BC. Moreover, Caesar had supported the Manilian law of 66 BC, which gave Pompey the command of the final phase of the Third Mithridatic War and, in 63 BC, as noted above, he proposed a motion to recall Pompey to Rome to restore order in the wake of the Catalinarian Conspiracy. Therefore, Caesar was willing to support Pompey because, although the latter was not a popularis, he was not an optimate either, making him a potential ally. Moreover, at the time of the creation of the first triumvirate, Pompey was at odds with the optimates. The suspension of his praetorship in 62 BC by the senate when he advocated the recall of Pompey had probably shown Caesar that his enemies had the means to marginalise him politically. To attain the consulship Caesar needed the support of Pompey and Crassus who, besides being the two most influential men in Rome, did not belong to the optimates and were thus likely to be politically marginalised as well. Plutarch maintained that Caesar sought an alliance with both men because allying with only one of them could have turned the other against him and he thought that he could play them off against each other.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Caesar, However, the picture might have been more nuanced than this. Crassus may also have had another reason‚Äîhaving to do with the equites‚Äîfor joining an alliance against the optimates. Cicero noted that in 60 BC Crassus advocated for the equites and induced them to demand that the senate annul some contracts they had taken up in the Roman province of Asia (in today's western Turkey) at an excessive price. The equites (equestrians) were a wealthy class of entrepreneurs who constituted the second social order in Rome, just below the patricians. Many equites were publicani, contractors who acted as suppliers for the army and construction projects (which they also oversaw) and as tax collectors. The state auctioned off the contracts for both suppliers and tax collectors to private firms, which had to pay for them in advance. The publicani had overextended themselves and fell into debt. Cicero thought that these contracts had been taken up in the rush for competition and that the demand was disgraceful and a confession of rash speculation. Nevertheless, he supported the annulment to avoid the equites becoming alienated with the senate and to maintain harmony between patricians and equites. However, his goals were frustrated when the proposal was opposed by the consul Quintus Caecilius Celer and Cato the Younger and subsequently rejected, leading Cicero to conclude that the equites were now at loggerheads with the senate.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 1.17.9, 2.1.8 It has been suggested that Crassus was closely associated with the equites and had investments with them.Badian, E., Publicans and Sinners; Private Enterprise in the Service of the Roman Republic, pp.103‚Äì104 It is likely that Crassus also saw the alliance with Pompey to ensure Caesar's consulship as a means to pass a measure to relieve publicani in debt.  Caesar‚Äôs consulship (59 BC)  The Tusculum portrait, a bust of Julius Caesar in the Archaeological Museum of Turin, Italy With the support of Pompey and Crassus, Caesar was elected consul for 59 BC. The most controversial measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots of land to the landless poor for farming, which encountered the traditional conservative opposition. In Cassius Dio's opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote the interests of the optimates as well as those of the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the opinion of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompey's veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompey's war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would have twenty members so that it would not be dominated by a clique and so that many men could share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men, an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out of self-interest and said that he was happy with being just the proposer of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged out of the senate house and arrested. Cato said that he was up for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 2.1‚Äì4.1 Appian wrote that the law provided for distribution of public land that was leased to generate public revenues in Campania, especially around Capua, to citizens who had at least three children, and that this included 20,000 men. When many senators opposed the bill, Caesar pretended to be indignant and rushed out of the senate. Appian noted that Caesar did not convene it again for the rest of the year. Instead, he harangued the people and proposed his bills to the plebeian council.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.10 Suetonius also mentioned the 20,000 citizens with three children. He also wrote that the allocations concerned land in the plain of Stella (a relatively remote area on the eastern Campanian border) that had been made public in by-gone days, and other public lands in Campania that had not been allotted but were under lease.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 30.3 Plutarch, who had a pro-aristocratic slant, thought that this law was not becoming of a consul, but for a most radical plebeian tribune. Land distribution, which was anathema to conservative aristocrats, was usually proposed by the plebeian tribunes who were often described by Roman writers (who were usually aristocrats) as base and vile. It was opposed by ‚Äòmen of the better sort‚Äô (aristocrats) and this gave Caesar an excuse to rush to the plebeian council, claiming that he was driven to it by the obduracy of the senate. It was only the most arrogant plebeian tribunes who courted the favour of the multitude and now Caesar did this to support his consular power 'in a disgraceful and humiliating manner'.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Caesar, 14.2‚Äì3; The Live of Cato Minor, 31-5-32.1 Caesar addressed the people and asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just said that he would not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, now private citizens, who both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set a date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened, and decided that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than its own inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced his way through the crowd with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. During the ensuing scuffle, some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar's supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.4‚Äì7.6Appian, The Civil Wars 2.11‚Äì12 The law was passed. The next day Calpurnius Bibulus tried unsuccessfully to get the senate, now afraid of the strong popular support for the law, to annul it. Bibulus retired to his home and did not appear in public for the rest of his consulship, instead sending notices declaring that it was a sacred period and that this made votes invalid each time Caesar passed a law. The plebeian tribunes who sided with the optimates also stopped performing any public duty. The people took the customary oath of obedience to the law. Cassius Dio wrote that Cato and Quintus Metellus Celer refused to swear compliance. However, on the day when they were to incur the established penalties they took the oath.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 6.4‚Äì6, 7 Appian wrote that many senators refused to take the oath but they relented because Caesar, through the plebeian council, enacted the death penalty for recusants. In Appian's account it is at this point that the Vettius affair occurred.Appian, The Civil wars, 2.12 Appian wrote that Vettius, a plebeian, ran to the forum with a drawn dagger to kill Caesar and Pompey. He was arrested and questioned at the senate house. He said that he had been sent by Calpurnius Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato, and that the dagger was given to him by one of the bodyguards of Calpurnius Bibulus. Caesar took advantage of this to arouse the crowd and postponed further interrogation to the next day. However, Vettius was killed in prison during the night. Caesar claimed that he was killed by the optimates who did not want to be exposed. The crowd gave Caesar a bodyguard. According to Appian, it is at this point that Bibulus withdrew from public business and did not go out of his house for the rest of his term of office. Caesar, who ran public affairs on his own, did not make any further investigations into this affair.Appian, The Civil Wars 2.12 In Cassius Dio's version, Vettius was sent by Cicero and Lucullus. He did not say when this happened and did not give any details about the actual event. He wrote that Vettius accused these two men and Calpurnius Bibulus. However, Bibulus had revealed the plan to Pompey, which undermined Vettius' credibility. There were suspicions that he was lying about Cicero and Lucullus as well and that this was a ploy by Caesar and Pompey to discredit the optimates. There were various theories, but nothing was proven. After naming the mentioned men in public, Vettius was sent to prison and was murdered a little later. Caesar and Pompey suspected Cicero and their suspicions were confirmed by his defence of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in a trial.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.9 Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not indicate when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke in front of the people, he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and it was clear that the supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Lucullus, 42.7 Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‚Äòdouble-dealing.‚Äô He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, The life of Julius Caesar, 20.5 Cicero gave an account in some letters to his friend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Minor that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches), where Vettius did not mention Curio, implicating other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on what to say during the night, given that the men he mentioned had not previously been under suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a setup and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 2.24Stockton, D., Cicero: A Political Biography, pp. 183‚Äì86 According to Cassius Dio, Cicero and Lucullus plotted to murder Caesar and Pompey because they were not happy with some steps they had taken. Fearing that Pompey might take charge in Rome while Caesar was away for his governorships (see below), Caesar tied Pompey to himself by marrying him to his daughter Julia even though she was betrothed to another man. He also married the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, one for the consuls elected for the next year (58 BC). Appian wrote that Cato said that Rome had become a mere matrimonial agency. These marriages were also mentioned by Plutarch and Suetonius.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.14Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Live of Caesar. 17.7, The Life of Pompey, 47.6Suetonius, The twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 21 Caesar proceeded to pass a number of laws without opposition. The first was designed to relieve the publicani from a third of their debt to the treasury (see previous section for details about the publicani). Cassius Dio noted that the equites often had asked for a relief measure to no avail because of opposition by the senate and, in particular, by Cato.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38. 6.4 Since the publicani were mostly equites Caesar gained the favour of this influential group. Appian wrote that the equites ‚Äòextolled Caesar to the skies‚Äô and that a more powerful group than that of the plebeians was added to Caesar's support.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.13 Caesar also ratified the acts of Pompey's settlements in the east, again, without opposition, not even by Licinius Lucullus. Caesar's influence eclipsed that of Calpurnius Bibulus, with some people suppressing the latter's name in speaking or writing and stating that the consuls were Gaius Caesar and Julius Caesar. The plebeian council granted him the governorship of Illyricum and Cisalpine Gaul with three legions for five years. The senate granted him the governorship of Transalpine Gaul and another legion (when the governor of that province died) because it feared that if it refused this the people would also grant this to Caesar.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 2.7.5; 8.2, 5Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.13Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 22.1Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Caesar, 14.10 Cassius Dio wrote that Caesar secretly set Publius Clodius Pulcher against Cicero, whom he considered a dangerous enemy, because of his suspicions about the Vettius affair. Caesar believed that Clodius owed him a favour in return for not testifying against him when he was tried for sacrilege three years earlier (see above).Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.12.1 However, Clodius did not need to owe anything to Caesar to attack Cicero: he already bore a grudge against him because he had testified against him at this trial. In another passage Cassius Dio wrote that after the trial Clodius hated the optimates.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.51.1 Suetonius described Clodius as the enemy of Cicero.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar 21.4 Appian wrote that Clodius had already requited Caesar by helping him to secure the governorship of Gaul before Caesar unleashed him against Cicero and that Caesar ‚Äòturned a private grievance to useful account‚Äô.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.14 Moreover, Clodius was already an ally of Pompey before this. As mentioned in the previous section, Plutarch wrote that Pompey had already allied with Clodius when his attempt to have the acts for his settlements in the east failed before the creation of the triumvirate.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pompey, 46.3 Clodius sought to become a plebeian tribune so that he could enjoy the powers of these tribunes to pursue his revenge against Cicero, including presiding over the plebeian council, proposing bills to its vote, vetoing the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta (written opinions of the senate on bills, which were presented for advice and usually followed to the letter). However, Clodius was a patrician and the plebeian tribunate was exclusively for plebeians. Therefore, he needed to be transferred to the plebeian order (transitio ad plebem) by being adopted into a plebeian family. In some letters written in 62 BC, the year after Clodius's trial, Cicero wrote that Herrenius, a plebeian tribune, made frequent proposals to the plebeian council to transfer Clodius to the plebs, but he was vetoed by many of his colleagues. He also proposed a law to the plebeian council to authorise the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers) to vote on the matter. The consul Quintus Metellus Celer proposed an identical bill to the comitia centuriata.Roman adoption was ratified by two different ceremonies, adoptio and adrogatio. The former was for men were under the authority of their fathers (patria potestas). The latter was for men who were sui juris (of one's own right)that is, not under patria potestas. Adrogatio, which applied to Clodius because his father had died, had to be performed by the comitia curiata. Clodius wanted to transfer adrogatio from the comitia curiata to the comitia centuriata. Cicero suggested that he wanted to submit his adoption to the vote of the people (he said the law was to authorise the whole people to vote on his adoption). The comitia centuriata was a voting body, whereas the comitia curiata was only a ceremonial body. Later in the year, Cicero wrote that Metellus Celer was ‚Äòoffering Clodius ‚Äòa splendid opposition‚Äô. The whole senate rejected it.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 1.18.51‚Äì52, 1.19.55, 2.1.4; On the Responses of the Haruspices, 45 Cassius Dio, instead, wrote that in that year Clodius actually got his transitio ad plebem and immediately sought the tribunate. However, he was not elected due to the opposition of Metellus Celer, who argued that his transitio ad plebem was not done according to the lex curiata, which provided that adrogatio should be performed in the comitia curiata. Cassius Dio wrote that this ended the episode. During his consulship Caesar effected this transitio ad plebem and had him elected as plebeian tribune with the cooperation of Pompey. Clodius silenced Calpurnius Bibulus when he wanted to make a speech on the last day of his consulship in 59 BC and also attacked Cicero.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.51.1‚Äì2; 38.12.1‚Äì3 Events in 58 BC and 57 BC Early in 58 BC Clodius proposed four laws. One re-established the legitimacy of the collegia; one made the state-funded grain dole for the poor completely free for the first time (previously it was at subsidised prices); one limited the remit of bans on the gatherings of the popular assemblies; and one limited the power of the censors to censor citizens who had not been previously tried and convicted. Cassius Dio thought that the aim of these laws was to gain the favour of the people, the equites and the senate before moving to crush the influential Cicero. Then he proposed a law that banned officials from performing augury (the divination of the omens of the gods) on the day of the vote by the popular assemblies, with the aim of preventing votes from being delayed. Officials often announced that they would perform augury on the day of the vote because during this voting was not allowed and this forced its postponement. In Cassius Dio's opinion, Clodius wanted to bring Cicero to trial and did not want the voting for the verdict delayed.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.12.4‚Äì5, 13 Cicero understood what was going on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays, outwitted them by deceit, agreeing with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). Of course, the actual target was Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar, who were secretly supporting Clodius, a fact they went to some pains to conceal from Cicero. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him a post as one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would be rendered ineffective in the face of Pompey and Cicero's combined opposition. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and allay any suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey, and also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39-14-16.1Grillo., L., Cicero‚Äôs De Provinciis Consularibus Oratio (2015), p. 3 The equites and two senators, Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Scribonius Curio, supported Cicero. They assembled on the Capitol and sent envoys to the consuls and the senate on his behalf. Lucius Ninnius tried to rally popular support, but Clodius prevented him from taking any action. Aulus Gabinius barred the equites from accessing the senate, drove one of the more persistent out of the city, and rebuked Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio. Calpurnius Piso advised Cicero that leaving Rome was the only way for him to be safe, at which Cicero took offence. Caesar condemned the illegality of the action taken in 63 BC, but did not approve the punishment proposed by the law because it was not fitting for any law to deal with past events. Crassus had shown some support through his son, but he sided with the people. Pompey promised help, but he kept making excuses and taking trips out of Rome. Cicero, unnerved by the situation, considered resorting to arms and slighted Pompey openly. However, he was stopped by Cato and Hortensius, who feared a civil war. Cicero then left for Sicily, where he had been a governor, hoping to find sympathy there. On that day the law was passed without opposition, being supported even by people who had actively helped Cicero. His property was confiscated and his house was demolished. Then Clodius carried a law that banned Cicero from a radius of 500 miles from Rome and provided that both he and those who harboured him could be killed with impunity. As a result of this, he went to Greece.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.16.2-6-18.1 However, Cicero's exile lasted only sixteen months (April 58 ‚Äì August 57 BC).Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.16Grillo., L., Cicero‚Äôs De Provinciis Consularibus Oratio (2015), p. 3 Pompey, who had engineered his exile, later wanted to have him recalled, because Clodius had taken a bribe to free Tigranes the Younger, one of Pompey‚Äòs prisoners from the Third Mithridatic War. When Pompey and Aulus Gabinius remonstrated, he insulted them and came into conflict with their followers. Pompey was annoyed because the authority of the plebeian tribunes, which he had restored in 70 BC (see above) was now being used against him by Clodius.Cassius Dio, Roman History 38.30.1‚Äì3 Plutarch wrote that when Pompey went to the forum a servant of Clodius went towards him with a sword in his hand. Pompey left and did not return to the forum while Clodius was a tribune (Plutarch must have meant except for public business as Pompey did attend sessions of the senate and the plebeian council, which were held in the northern area of the forum). He stayed at home and conferred about how to appease the senate and the nobility. He was urged to divorce Julia and switch allegiance from Caesar to the senate. He rejected this proposal, but agreed with ending Cicero's exile. So, he escorted Cicero's brother to the forum with a large escort to lodge the recall petition. There was another violent clash with casualties, but Pompey got the better of it.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pompey, 49.1‚Äì3 Pompey got Ninnius to work on Cicero's recall by introducing a motion in Cicero's favour in the senate and opposing Clodius ‚Äòat every point‚Äô. Titus Annius Milo, another plebeian tribune, presented the measure to the plebeian council and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, one of the consuls for 57 BC, provided support in the senate partly as a favour to Pompey and partly because of his enmity towards Clodius. Clodius was supported by his brother Appius Claudius, who was a praetor, and the other consul, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos who had opposed Cicero six years earlier (see above). Pro-Cicero and pro-Clodius factions developed, leading to violence between the two. On the day of the vote, Clodius attacked the assembled people with gladiators, resulting in casualties, and the bill was not passed. Milo indicted the fearsome Clodius for the violence, but Metellus Nepos prevented this. Milo started using gladiators, too, and there was bloodshed around the city. Metellus Nepos, under pressure from Pompey and Lentulus Spinther, changed his mind. The senate decreed Spinther's motion for the recall of Cicero and both consuls proposed it to the plebeian council, which passed it.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.30.3‚Äì4, 39.6‚Äì8 Appian wrote that Pompey gave Milo hope that he would become consul, set him against Clodius and got him to call for a vote for the recall. He hoped that Cicero would then no longer speak against the triumvirate.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.16 When Cicero returned to Rome, he reconciled with Pompey, at a time when popular discontent with the Senate was high due to food shortages. When the people began to make death threats, Cicero persuaded them pass a law to elect Pompey as praefectus annonae (prefect of the provisions) in Italy and beyond for five years. This post was instituted at times of severe grain shortage to supervise the grain supply. Clodius alleged that the scarcity of rain had been engineered to propose a law that boosted Pompey's power, which had been decreasing. Plutarch noted that others said that it was a device by Lentulus Spinther to confine Pompey to an office so that Spinther would be sent instead to Egypt to help Ptolemy XII of Egypt put down a rebellion. A plebeian tribune had proposed a law to send Pompey to Egypt as a mediator without an army, but the senate rejected it, citing safety concerns. As praefectus annonae Pompey sent agents and friends to various places and sailed to Sardinia, Sicily and the Roman province of Africa (the breadbaskets of the Roman empire) to collect grain. So successful was this venture that the markets were filled and there was also enough to supply foreign peoples. Both Plutarch and Cassius Dio thought that the law made Pompey ‚Äòthe master of all the land and sea under Roman possession‚Äô. Appian wrote that this success gave Pompey great reputation and power. Cassius Dio also wrote that Pompey faced some delays in the distribution of grain because many slaves had been freed prior to the distribution and Pompey wanted to take a census to ensure they received it in an orderly way.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pompey, 49.4‚Äì6, 50Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.9. 24.1‚Äì2Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.18 Having escaped prosecution, Clodius attained the aedileship for 57 BC. He then started proceedings against Milo for inciting violence, the same charge Milo had brought against him. He did not expect a conviction, as Milo had many powerful allies, including Cicero and Pompey. He used this to attack both his followers and Pompey, inciting his supporters to taunt Pompey in the assemblies, which the latter was powerless to stop. He also continued his attacks on Cicero. The latter claimed that his transitio ad plebem was illegal and so were the laws he had passed, including the one that sanctioned his exile. And so clashes between the two factions continued.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.18‚Äì20.3, 21 Luca conference and subsequent events In 56 BC Caesar, who was fighting the Gallic Wars, crossed the Alps into Italy and wintered in Luca (Lucca, Tuscany). In the Life of Crassus, Plutarch wrote that a big crowd wanted to see him and 200 men of senatorial rank and various high officials turned up. He met Pompey and Crassus and agreed that the two of them would stand for the consulship and that he would support them by sending soldiers to Rome to vote for them. They were then to secure the command of provinces and armies for themselves and confirm his provinces for a further five years. Therefore, he worked on putting the officials of the year under his obligation. In the Life of Pompey, Plutarch added that Caesar also wrote letters to his friends and that the three men were aiming at making themselves the masters of the state.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Pompey, 51.3‚Äì6; The Life of Crassus, 14. 4‚Äì6 Suetonius maintained that Caesar compelled Pompey and Crassus to meet him at Luca. This was because Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, one of the praetors, called for an inquiry into his conduct in the previous year. Caesar went to Rome and put the matter before the senate, but this was not taken up and he returned to Gaul. He was also a target for prosecution by a plebeian tribune, but he was not brought to trial because he pleaded with the other tribunes not to prosecute him on the grounds of his absence from Rome. Lucius Domitius was now a candidate for the consulship and openly threatened to take up arms against him. Caesar prevailed on Pompey and Crassus to stand for the consulship against Lucius Domitius. He succeeded through their influence to have his term as governor of Gaul extended for five years.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Julius Caesar, 23, 24.1 In Appian's account, too, 200 senators went to see Caesar, as did many incumbent officials, governors and commanders. They thanked him for gifts they received or asked for money or favours. Caesar, Pompey and Crassus agreed on the consulship of the latter two and the extension of Caesar's governorship. In this version Lucius Domitius presented his candidacy for the consulship after Luca and did so against Pompey.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.17 Cassius Dio, who wrote the most detailed account of the period, did not mention the Luca conference. In his version, instead, Pompey and Crassus agreed to stand for the consulship between themselves as a counterpoise to Caesar. Pompey was annoyed about the increasing admiration of Caesar due to his success in the Gallic Wars, feeling that this was overshadowing his own exploits. He tried to persuade the consuls not to read Caesar's reports from Gaul and to send someone to relieve his command. He was unable to achieve anything through the consuls and felt that Caesar no longer needed him. Believing himself to be in a precarious situation and thus unable to challenge Caesar on his own, Pompey began to arm himself and got closer to Crassus. The two men decided to stand for the consulship to tip the balance of power in their favor. So, they gave up their pretence that they did not want to take the office and begun canvassing, although outside the legally specified period. The consuls said that there would not be any elections that year and that they would appoint an interrex to preside over the elections in the next year so that they would have to seek election in accordance with the law. There was a lot of wrangling in the senate and the senators left the session. Cato, who in that year was a plebeian tribune, called people from the forum into the senate house because voting was not allowed in the presence of non-senators. However, other plebeian tribunes prevented the outsiders from getting in. The decree was passed. Another decree was opposed by Cato. The senators left and went to the forum and one of them, Marcellinus, presented their complaints to the people. Clodius took Pompey's side again to get his support for his aims, addressed the people, inveighing against Marcellinus, and then went to the senate house. The senators prevented him from entering and he was nearly lynched. He called out for the people to help him and some people threatened to torch the senate house. Later Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls without any opposing candidates apart from Lucius Domitius. One of the slaves who was accompanying him in the forum was killed. Fearing for his own safety, Clodius withdrew his candidacy. Publius Crassus, a son of Crassus who was one of Caesar's lieutenants, brought soldiers to Rome for intimidation.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.24.14, 25.1‚Äì4,28.1‚Äì4, 26‚Äì30.1‚Äì3, 31 In the Life of Crassus, Plutarch wrote that in Rome there were reports about the two men's meeting with Caesar. Pompey and Crassus were asked if they were going to be candidates for the consulship. Pompey replied that perhaps he was, and perhaps he was not. Crassus replied that he would if it was in the interest of the city, but otherwise he would desist. When they announced their candidacies everyone withdrew theirs, but Cato encouraged Lucius Domitius to proceed with his. He withdrew it when his slave was killed. Plutarch mentioned Cato's encouragement and the murder of the slave in The Life of Pompey as well.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 15, The Life of Pompey, 51.4‚Äì6 In Cassius Dio's account after the election Pompey and Crassus did not state what their intentions were and pretended that they wanted nothing further. Gaius Trebonius, a plebeian tribune, proposed a measure that gave the province of Syria and the nearby lands to one of the consuls and the provinces of Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior to the other. They would hold the command there for five years. They could levy as many troops as they wanted and ‚Äòmake peace and war with whomsoever they pleased‚Äô. According to Cassius Dio, who held that Crassus and Pompey wanted to counter Caesar's power, many people were angry about this, especially Caesar's supporters, who felt that Pompey and Crassus wanted to restrict Caesar's power and remove him from his governorship. Therefore, Crassus and Pompey extended Caesar's command in Gaul for three years. Cassius Dio stated that this was the actual fact, which implies that he disagreed with the notion that his command was extended for five years. With Caesar's supporters appeased, Pompey and Crassus made this public only when their own arrangements were confirmed.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.33 In The Life of Pompey, Plutarch wrote the laws proposed by Trebonius were in accordance with the agreement made at Luca. They gave Caesar's command a second five-year term, assigned the province of Syria and an expedition against Parthia to Crassus and gave Pompey the two provinces in Hispania (where there had recently been disturbancesCassius Dio, Roman History, 39.33.2), the whole of Africa (presumably Plutarch meant Cyrenaica as well as the province of Africa) and four legions. Pompey lent two of these legions to Caesar for his wars in Gaul at his request.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Pompey, 52.3 According to Appian Pompey lent Caesar only one legion. This was when Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta and Quintus Titurius Sabinus, two of Caesar's lieutenants, were defeated in Gaul by Ambiorix in 54 BC.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.29, 33.2 Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the opposition to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote, Gallus, who had been let out of the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd, which caused general upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and passed the measure in favour of Caesar.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.34‚Äì36Plutarch, The Life of Cato Minor, 43.1‚Äì3 Pompey and Crassus conducted the levy for their campaigns in their provinces, which created discontent. Some of the plebeian tribunes instituted a suit nominally against Pompey's and Crassus' lieutenants that was actually aimed at them personally. The tribunes then tried to annul levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns. Pompey was not perturbed because had already sent his lieutenants to Hispania. He had intended to let them deal with Hispania while he would gladly stay in Rome with the pretext that he had to stay there because he was the praefectus annonae. Crassus, on the other hand, needed his levy for his campaign against Parthia, and so he considered using force against the tribunes. The unarmed plebeian tribunes avoided a violent confrontation, but they did criticise him. While Crassus was offering the prayers, which were customary before war, they claimed bad omens. One of the tribunes tried to have Crassus arrested. However, the others objected and while they were arguing, Crassus left the city. He then headed for Syria and invaded Parthia.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 39.39 Plutarch thought that Crassus, the richest man in Rome, felt inferior to Pompey and Caesar only in military achievement and added a passion for glory to his greed. His achievements in the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC) and in the Third Servile War (71 BC) were now a fading memory. Plutarch also wrote that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul, approving of his intentions and spurring him to war.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 14.4, 16.3 End of the triumvirate (53 BC) A Roman bust of Crassus in the Louvre, Paris, France In 54 BC, as Caesar continued his campaigns in Gaul and Crassus undertook his campaign against the Parthians, Pompey was the only member of the triumvirate left in Rome. Because Cicero, grateful for his recall, no longer opposed Pompey, Cato became the triumvirate's main opponent. With bribery and corruption rampant throughout the Republic, Cato, who was elected praetor for 54 BC, got the senate to decree that elected officials submit their accounts to a court for scrutiny of their expenditures for electoral canvassing. This aggrieved both the men in question and the people (who were given money for votes). Cato was attacked by a crowd during a court hearing, but managed to bring the disturbance to an end with a speech. Cato then monitored the subsequent elections against misconduct after an agreement on electoral practices, which made him popular. Pompey considered this a dilution of his power and set his supporters against Cato. This included Clodius, who had joined Pompey's fold again.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Cato Minor, 44.1‚Äì4, 45 In September 54 BC, Julia, the daughter of Caesar and wife of Pompey, died while giving birth to a girl, who also died a few days later.Cassius Dio, Roman History 39.64.1Appian, The Civil Wars 2.19 Plutarch wrote that Caesar felt that this was the end of his good relationship with Pompey. The prospect of a breach between Caesar and Pompey created unrest in Rome. The campaign of Crassus against Parthia was disastrous. Shortly after the death of Julia, Crassus died at the Battle of Carrhae (May 53 BC), bringing the first triumvirate to an end. Plutarch thought that fear of Crassus had led to Pompey and Caesar to be decent to each other, and his death paved the way for the subsequent friction between these two men and the events that eventually led to civil war.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Live of Caesar 23.5‚Äì6; The Live of Pompey, 53.4‚Äì6 Florus wrote: \\"Caesar's power now inspired the envy of Pompey, while Pompey's eminence was offensive to Caesar; Pompey could not brook an equal or Caesar a superior.\\"Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 2.13.14 Seneca wrote that with regard to Caesar, Pompey \\"would ill endure that anyone besides himself should become a great power in the state, and one who was likely to place a check upon his advancement, which he had regarded as onerous even when each gained by the other's rise: yet within three days' time he resumed his duties as general, and conquered his grief [for the death of his wife] as quickly as he was wont to conquer everything else.\\"Seneca, Dialogues, Book 6, Of Consolation: To Marcia, 6.14.3 In the Life of Pompey, Plutarch wrote that the plebeian tribune Lucilius proposed to elect Pompey dictator, which Cato opposed. Lucilius came close to losing his tribunate. Despite all this, two consuls for the next year (53 BC) were elected as usual. In 53 BC three candidates stood for the consulship for 52 BC. Besides resorting to bribery, they promoted factional violence, which Plutarch saw as a civil war. There were renewed and stronger calls for a dictator. However, in the Life of Cato, Plutarch did not mention any calls for a dictator and instead he wrote that there were calls for Pompey to preside over the elections, which Cato opposed. In both versions, the violence among the three factions continued and the elections could not be held. The optimates favoured entrusting Pompey with restoring order. Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the former enemy of the triumvirate, proposed in the senate that Pompey should be elected as sole consul. Cato changed his mind and supported this on the ground that any government was better than no government. Pompey asked him to become his adviser and associate in governance, and Cato replied that he would do so in a private capacity.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Pompey, 54; The Life of Cato Minor, 47‚Äì49 Pompey married Cornelia, a daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. Some people disliked this because Cornelia was much younger and she would have been a better match for his sons. There were also people who thought that Pompey gave priority to his wedding over dealing with the crisis in the city. Pompey was also seen as being partial in the conduct of some trials. He succeeded in restoring order and chose his father-in‚Äëlaw as his colleague for the last five months of the year. Pompey was granted an extension of his command in his provinces and was given an annual sum for the maintenance of his troops. Cato warned Pompey about Caesar's manoeuvres to increase his power by using the money he made from the spoils of war to extend is patronage in Rome and urged him to counter Caesar. Pompey hesitated, and Cato stood for the consulship in order to deprive Caesar of his military command and have him tried. However, he was not elected. The supporters of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved an extension of his command so that the fruits of his success would not be lost. During the ensuing debate, Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar in which he said he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said that he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's proposal, which gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this, he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.29 Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato was exacerbated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy, as he was feted in towns through which he traveled on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‚Äòto have done more than anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war‚Äô. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar's power.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Cato Minor, 49, The Life of Pompey, 54.5-6-57 The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War. Soon after, a second triumvirate formed. The Second Triumvirate was the political alliance between three of the Roman Republic's most powerful figures: Octavian (the future emperor Augustus), Mark Antony, and Lepidus. Formally called the Triumvirate for Organizing the Republic (Latin: tresviri rei publicae constituendae),[2] it was formed on 27 November 43 BC with the enactment of the Lex Titia, and existed for two five-year terms, covering the period until 33 BC. Unlike the earlier First Triumvirate (between Julius Caesar, Pompey and Crassus),[3][4] the Second Triumvirate was an official, legally established institution, whose overwhelming power in the Roman state was given full legal sanction and whose imperium maius outranked that of all other magistrates, including the consuls.

The Second Triumvirate declared the civil war ostensibly to avenge Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, but the underlying cause was a long-brewing conflict between the so-called Optimates and the so-called Populares. The battle, involving up to 200,000 men in one of the largest of the Roman civil wars, consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi. The first occurred in the first week of October; Brutus faced Octavian, and Antony's forces fought those of Cassius. The Roman armies fought poorly, with low discipline, nonexistent tactical co-ordination and amateurish lack of command experience evident in abundance with neither side able to exploit opportunities as they developed. At first, Brutus pushed back Octavian and entered his legions' camp. However, to the south, Cassius was defeated by Antony and committed suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed. Brutus rallied Cassius's remaining troops, and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils. The battle was essentially a draw but for Cassius's suicide. A second encounter, on 23 October, finished off Brutus's forces after a hard-fought battle. He committed suicide in turn, leaving the triumvirate in control of the Roman Republic.  Prelude  After the assassination of Caesar, the two main conspirators, Brutus and Cassius, also known as the Liberators and leaders of the Republicans had left Italy. They took control of all the eastern provinces from Greece to Syria and of the allied eastern kingdoms. In Rome the three main Caesarian leaders (Antony, Octavian and Lepidus), who controlled almost all the Roman army in the west, had crushed the opposition of the senate and established the second triumvirate. One of their first tasks was to destroy the Liberators' forces, not only to get full control of the Roman world, but also to avenge Caesar's death. The triumvirs decided that Lepidus would remain in Italy, while the two main partners of the triumvirate, Antony and Octavian, moved to northern Greece with their best troops, a total of 28 legions. They were able to ferry their army across the Adriatic and sent out a scouting force of eight legions, commanded by Norbanus and Saxa, along the Via Egnatia, with the aim of searching for the Liberators' army. Norbanus and Saxa passed the town of Philippi in eastern Macedonia and took a strong defensive position at a narrow mountain pass. Antony was following, while Octavian was delayed at Dyrrachium because of his ill-health (which would accompany him throughout the Philippi campaign). Although Antony and Octavian had been able to cross the sea with their main force, further communications with Italy were made difficult by the arrival of the Republican admiral Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, with a large fleet of 130 ships. The Liberators did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the triumvirs' communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest. They gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the eastern provinces and levies from allies. With their superior forces they were able to outflank Norbanus and Saxa, who had to abandon their defensive position and retreat west of Philippi. This meant that Brutus and Cassius could position their forces to hold the high ground along both sides of the Via Egnatia, about west of the city of Philippi. The southern position was anchored on a supposedly impassable marsh, while on the north on impassable hills. They had time to fortify their position with a rampart and ditch. Brutus positioned his camp to the north while Cassius was on the south of the via Egnatia. Antony arrived and positioned his army south of the via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road.  Forces  = Antony and Octavian = The Triumvirs' army present for the battle included nineteen legions. The sources specify the name of only one legion, IV legion, but other legions present included the III, VI, VII, VIII, X Equestris, XII, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, and XXX, since their veterans participated in the land settlements after the battle. Appian reports that the triumvirs' legions were almost at full complement. Furthermore, they had a large allied cavalry force of 13,000 horsemen. = The liberators = The Liberators' army had seventeen legions; eight with Brutus and nine with Cassius, while two other legions were with the fleet. Only two of the legions were at full strength, but the army was reinforced by levies from the eastern allied kingdoms. Appian reports that the army mustered a total of about 80,000 foot-soldiers. Allied cavalry totaled 20,000 horsemen, including 5,000 bowmen mounted in the Eastern fashion. This army included the old Caesarean legions present in the east, probably including XXVII, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXI and XXXIII legions; so most of these legionaries were Caesarean veterans. However, at least the XXXVI legion consisted of old Pompeian veterans, enrolled in Caesar's army after the Battle of Pharsalus. The loyalty of the soldiers who were supposed to fight against Caesar's heir was a delicate issue for the Liberators. It is important to emphasize that the name \\"Octavian\\" was never used by contemporaries: he was simply known as Gaius Iulius Caesar. Cassius tried to reinforce the soldiers' loyalty both with strong speeches (\\"Let it give no one any concern that he has been one of Caesar's soldiers. We were not his soldiers then, but our country's\\") and with a gift of 1,500 denarii for each legionary and 7,500 for each centurion. Although ancient sources do not report the total numbers of men of the two armies, it seems that they had a similar strength. Adrian Goldsworthy suggests that at full strength the 19 Triumvir legions may have amounted to 95,000 men and the 17 Liberators' legions to 85,000. Most likely each side had only 40,000‚Äì50,000 legionaries. As the campaign lasted for months, it is unlikely that either side could have sustained the logistics to keep so many men, horses and baggage animals fed if both sides had had 100,000 or so troops.  First battle  Antony offered battle several times, but the Liberators were not lured into leaving their defensive position. Antony tried to secretly outflank the Liberators' position through the marshes in the south. With great effort he was able to cut a passage through the marshes, throwing up a causeway over them. This manoeuvre was finally noticed by Cassius, who countered by moving part of his army south into the marshes and constructing a transverse wall in a bid to cut off Antony's outstretched right wing. This brought about a general battle on 3 October 42 BC. First Battle of Philippi Antony ordered a charge against Cassius, aiming at the fortifications between Cassius's camp and the marshes. At the same time, Brutus's soldiers, provoked by the triumvirs' army, rushed against Octavian's army, without waiting for the order of attack, which was to be given with the watchword \\"Liberty\\". This surprise assault had complete success: Octavian's troops were put to flight and pursued up to their camp, which was captured by Brutus's men, led by Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Three of Octavian's legions had their standards taken, a clear sign of a rout. Octavian was not found in his tent: his couch was pierced and cut to pieces. Most ancient historians say that he had been warned in a dream to beware of that day, as he wrote in his memoirs. Pliny bluntly reports that Octavian went into hiding in the marsh. Brutus and his companions after the Battle of Philippi However, on the other side of the Via Egnatia, Antony was able to storm Cassius' fortifications, demolishing the palisade and filling up the ditch. Then he easily took Cassius's camp, which was defended by only a few men. It seems that part of Cassius's army had advanced south: when these men tried to come back they were easily repulsed by Antony. Apparently the battle had ended in a draw. Cassius had lost 8,000 men, while Octavian had about 16,000 casualties. The battlefield was very large and clouds of dust made it impossible to make a clear assessment of the outcome of the battle, so both wings were ignorant of each other's fate. Cassius moved to the top of a hill, but could not see what was happening on Brutus's side. Believing that he had suffered a crushing defeat he ordered his freedman Pindarus to kill him. Brutus mourned over Cassius's body, calling him \\"the last of the Romans\\". He avoided a public funeral, fearing its negative effects on the army morale. Other sources credit the avarice of Brutus' troops as the factor that undid their definitive victory on October3. Premature looting and gathering of treasure by Brutus's advancing forces allowed Octavian's troops to re-form their line. In Octavian's future reign as Emperor, a common battle cry became \\"Complete the battle once begun!\\"  Second battle  On the same day as the first battle, the Republican fleet was able to intercept and destroy the triumvirs' reinforcements of two legions and other troops and supplies led by Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus. The strategic position of Antony and Octavian became perilous, since the already depleted regions of Macedonia and Thessaly were unable to supply their army for long, while Brutus could easily receive supplies from the sea. The triumvirs had to send a legion south to Achaia to collect more supplies. The morale of the troops was boosted by the promise of a further 5,000 denarii for each soldier and 25,000 for each centurion. On the other side, the Liberators' army was left without its best strategic mind. Brutus had less military experience than Cassius and, even worse, he could not command the same respect from his allies and his soldiers, although after the battle he offered another gift of 1,000 denarii for each soldier. In the next three weeks, Antony was able to slowly advance his forces south of Brutus's army, fortifying a hill close to Cassius's former camp, which had been left unguarded by Brutus. Second Battle of Philippi To avoid being outflanked Brutus was compelled to extend his line to the south and then the east, parallel to the Via Egnatia, building several fortified posts. While still holding the high ground he wanted to keep to the original plan of avoiding an open engagement and waiting for his naval superiority to wear out the enemy. The traditional understanding is that Brutus, against his better judgment, subsequently abandoned this strategy because his officers and soldiers were tired of the delaying tactics and demanded he offer another open battle. Brutus and his officers may have feared that their soldiers would desert to the enemy if they appeared to have lost the initiative. Plutarch also reports that Brutus had not received news of Domitius Calvinus' defeat in the Ionian Sea. When some of the eastern allies and mercenaries started deserting, Brutus was forced to attack on the afternoon of October23. As he said, \\"I seem to carry on war like Pompey the Great, not so much commanding as commanded.\\" However, the reality is that Brutus had no option but to fight, because his entire position was now in danger of being isolated and rendered untenable. If the triumvirs were allowed to continue stretching their lines unimpeded to the east they would ultimately cut off his supply route to Neapolis and pin him against the mountains. If that happened, the tables would be turned; Brutus would either be starved into submission or be forced to retreat by taking his entire army via the hazardous northern trail that had brought him to Philippi. The battle which ensued resulted in close combat between two armies of well- trained veterans. Ranged weapons such as arrows or javelins were largely ignored; instead, the soldiers packed into solid ranks and fought face-to-face with their swords, and the slaughter was terrible. According to Cassius Dio, the two sides had little need for missile weapons, \\"for they did not resort to the usual manoeuvres and tactics of battles\\" but immediately advanced to close combat, \\"seeking to break each other's ranks\\". In the account of Plutarch, Brutus had the better of the fight at the western end of his line and pressed hard on the triumvirs' left wing, which gave way and retreated, being harassed by the Republican cavalry, which sought to exploit the advantage when it saw the enemy in disorder. But the eastern flank of Brutus's line had inferior numbers because it had been extended to avoid being outflanked. This meant Brutus's legions had been drawn out too thin in the center, and were so weak here they could not withstand the triumvirs' initial charge. Having broken through, the triumvirs swung to their left to take Brutus in his flank and rear. Appian speaks of the triumvirs' legions having \\"pushed back the enemy's line as though they were turning round a very heavy machine.\\" Brutus's legions were driven back step-by-step, slowly at first, but as their ranks crumbled under the pressure they began to give ground more rapidly. The second and third reserve lines in the rear failed to keep pace with the retreat and all three lines became entangled. Octavian's soldiers were able to capture the gates of Brutus's camp before the routing army could reach this defensive position. Brutus's army could not reform, which made the triumvirs' victory complete. Brutus was able to retreat into the nearby hills with the equivalent of only four legions. Seeing that surrender and capture were inevitable, Brutus committed suicide. The total casualties for the second battle of Philippi were not reported, but the close quarters fighting likely resulted in heavy losses for both sides.  Aftermath  Plutarch reports that Antony covered Brutus's body with a purple garment as a sign of respect. Although they had not been close friends, he remembered that Brutus had stipulated, as a condition for his joining the plot to assassinate Caesar, that the life of Antony be spared. Many other young Roman aristocrats lost their lives in the battle or committed suicide after the defeat, including the son of great orator Hortensius, and Marcus Porcius Cato, the son of Cato the Younger, and Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, the father of Livia, who became Octavian's wife. Some of the nobles who were able to escape negotiated their surrender to Antony and entered his service. Among them were Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus and Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. Apparently the nobles did not want to deal with the young and merciless Octavian. The remains of the Liberators' army were rounded up, and roughly 14,000 men were enrolled into the Triumvirs' army. Old veterans were discharged back to Italy, but some of the veterans remained in the town of Philippi, which became a Roman colony, Colonia Victrix Philippensium. Antony remained in the East, while Octavian returned to Italy, with the difficult task of finding enough land on which to settle a large number of veterans. Although Sextus Pompey was controlling Sicily and Domitius Ahenobarbus still commanded the Republican fleet, the Republican resistance had been definitively crushed at Philippi. The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antony's career: at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate.  Quotes  Plutarch famously reported that Brutus experienced a vision of a ghost a few months before the battle. One night he saw a huge and shadowy form appearing in front of him; when he calmly asked, \\"What and whence art thou?\\" it answered \\"Thy evil spirit, Brutus: I shall see thee at Philippi.\\" He again met the ghost the night before the battle. This episode is one of the most famous in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar. Plutarch also reports the last words of Brutus, quoted by a Greek tragedy \\"O wretched Virtue, thou wert but a name, and yet I worshipped thee as real indeed; but now, it seems, thou were but fortune's slave.\\" Augustus's own version of the Battle of Philippi was: \\"I sent into exile the murderers of my father, punishing their crimes with lawful tribunals, and afterwards, when they made war upon the Republic, I twice defeated them in battle.\\" Qui parentem meum [interfecer]un[t eo]s in exilium expuli iudiciis legitimis ultus eorum [fa]cin[us, e]t postea bellum inferentis rei publicae vici b[is a]cie. Res Gestae 2.  Popular culture  The battle figures in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (background of the story in Acts 4 and 5), in which the two battles are merged into a single day's events. After Cassius' death Brutus says \\"Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night / We shall try fortune in a second fight.\\" Otherwise the information is mostly accurate. A fictionalised account of the battle is depicted in the sixth episode of the second season of the HBO television series Rome. There is but a single battle and both Cassius and Brutus fall in battle instead of being suicides, though Brutus's death is a lone, suicidal attack on the triumvirate's' advancing forces.

It is popular in the Middle East and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe. It can also be found in most grocery stores in North America and Europe. Etymology and spelling \\"Hummus\\" comes from the Arabic word ·∏•ummu·π£ meaning \\"chickpeas\\", a variant of ·∏•imma·π£ or ·∏•immi·π£. It may be of Aramaic origin, corresponding to the Syriac word for chickpeas: ·∏•em(m)·π£ƒì. The full name of the prepared spread in Arabic is ·∏•ummu·π£ bi ·π≠a·∏•ƒ´na which means \\"chickpeas with tahini\\".Maan Z. Madina, Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language, 1973, s.v. ÿ≠ ŸÖ ÿµ Spelling of the word in English can be inconsistent, though most major dictionaries from American and British publishers give hummus as the primary spelling. Some American dictionaries give hommos as an alternative, while British dictionaries give houmous or hoummos. Other spellings include homous, houmos, houmus, and similar variants. While humus (as it is spelled in Turkish) is sometimes found, it is generally avoided as it conflicts with another English word that refers to organic matter in soil. Origin and history Hummus topped with whole chickpeas and olive oil Although multiple different theories and claims of origins exist in various parts of the Middle East, evidence is insufficient to determine the precise location or time of the invention of hummus. Its basic ingredients‚Äîchickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic‚Äîhave been combined and eaten in the Levant over centuries.Tannahill p. 25, 61Brothwell & Brothwell passim Though regional populations widely ate chickpeas, and often cooked them in stews and other hot dishes,e.g. a \\"simple dish\\" of meat, pulses and spices Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi described in the 13th century, Tannahill p. 174 pur√©ed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant. The earliest known written recipes for a dish resembling hummus bi tahina are recorded in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 13th century.Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley & Sons, 2010, By Gil Marks, page 270 A cold pur√©e of chickpeas with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, appears in the Kanz al-Fawa'id fi Tanwi' al-Mawa'id;Lilia Zaouali, Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World, University of California Press, 2007, , translation of L'Islam a tavola (2004), p. 65 and a pur√©e of chickpeas and tahini called hummus kasa appears in the Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada: it is based on pur√©ed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (though not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight,Perry et al., p. 383 which presumably gives it a very different texture from hummus bi tahina. Regional preparations Hummus with pine nuts and olive oil Hummus served with pita As an appetizer and dip, diners scoop hummus with flatbread, such as pita. It is also served as part of a meze or as an accompaniment to falafel, grilled chicken, fish, or eggplant. Garnishes include chopped tomato, cucumber, coriander, parsley, caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, whole chickpeas, olive oil, hard-boiled eggs, paprika, sumac, ful, olives, pickles, and pine nuts. Outside the Middle East, it is sometimes served with tortilla chips or crackers. Hummus ful (pronounced ) is topped with a paste made from fava beans boiled until soft and then crushed. Hummus msabbaha/mashawsha is a mixture of hummus paste, warm chickpeas, and tahini. Hummus is a popular dip in Egypt where it is eaten with pita, and frequently flavored with cumin or other spices. For Palestinians and Jordanians, hummus has long been a staple food, often served as a warm dish, with bread for breakfast, lunch or dinner. All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in Palestinian gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. In Palestine, hummus is usually garnished, with olive oil, \\"nana\\" mint leaves, paprika, and parsley.Ibrahim, Lailie, Institute for Middle East Understanding, Hummus, a Palestinian staple , 31 March 2006. Retrieved 9 March 2008. A related dish popular in Palestine and Jordan is laban ma' hummus (\\"yogurt and chickpeas\\"), which uses yogurt in the place of tahini and butter in the place of olive oil and is topped with pieces of toasted bread. Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel. It is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Jewish immigrants arriving from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century adopted much of the local Palestinian cuisine, including hummus, though it traditionally has been part of the cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews who lived in Arabic-speaking lands. The many Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from these countries brought their own unique variations, such as hummus with fried eggplant and boiled eggs prepared by Iraqi Jews, and Hasa Al Hummus, a chickpea soup preferred by Moroccans. The Yemenite quarter of Tel Aviv is known for its hummus with traditional skhug hot sauce. More recently, African immigrants have brought specialties such as Sudanese Hummus Darfur, with eggs, tomatoes, and grated cheese. Arab Israelis and Jews alike seek out authentic hummus in Arab hummusia, restaurants specializing in hummus dishes, making famous such Arab villages as Abu Gosh and Kafr Yasif. Enthusiasts travel to the more remote Arab and Druze villages in the northern Galilee region in search of the perfect hummus experience. Although sometimes criticized as Jewish appropriation of Palestinian and Arab culture, hummus has been adopted as an unofficial \\"national dish\\" of Israel, reflecting its huge popularity and significance among the entire Israeli population. Many restaurants run by Mizrahi Jews and Arab citizens of Israel are dedicated to warm hummus, which may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini. One of the hummus versions available is msabbaha, made with lemon-spiked tahini garnished with whole chick peas, a sprinkling of paprika and a drizzle of olive oil.Food & Wine, May 2008; On the Hummus Hunt in Israel by Jen Murphy, p. 66, One author calls hummus, \\"One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes\\" and a \\"must on any mezzeh table.\\"Arto der Hartoiunian Vegetarian Dishes from the Middle East, London 1983, p.33. Syrian and Lebanese in Canada's Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh, even among the third- and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants. In Cyprus, hummus is part of the local cuisine in both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities where it is called \\"humoi\\" (). In the United Kingdom, hummus was popularized by Greek Cypriot caterers, sometimes leading to a perception of it being a Greek food,Sami Zubaida, \\"National, Communal and Global Dimensions in Middle Eastern Food Cultures\\" in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East, London and New York, 1994 and 2000, , p. 35. though it is not well known in Greece. In Turkey, hummus is considered a meze and usually oven-dried with pastƒ±rma, which differs from the traditional serving. In the United States and Europe, hummus is commercially available in numerous traditional and non-traditional varieties, such as beet or chocolate. It is also sometimes used as a pizza topping. Nutrition Chickpeas, the main ingredient of conventional hummus, have appreciable amounts of dietary fiber, protein, vitamin B6, manganese and other nutrients. As hummus recipes vary, so does nutritional content, depending primarily on the relative proportions of chickpeas, tahini, and water. Hummus provides roughly 170 calories for 100 grams, and is a good to excellent (more than 10% of the Daily Value) source of dietary fiber, vitamin B6, and several dietary minerals. Fat content, mostly from tahini and olive oil, is about 14% of the total; other major components are 65% water, 17% total carbohydrates, including a small amount of sugar, and about 10% protein. Packaged product Lebanese-produced hummus in a can for export markets =United States= In 2006, hummus was present in 12 percent of American households, rising to 17 percent by early 2009.There‚Äôs Hummus Among Us By Elena Ferretti, Fox News, April 5, 2010 One commentator attributed the growth of hummus to America's embrace of ethnic and exotic foods. While in 2006‚Äì08 when some 15 million Americans consumed hummus, and annual national sales were about $5 million, sales growth in 2016 was reflected by an estimated 25% of US households consuming hummus. By 2016, the leading American hummus manufacturer, Sabra Dipping Company, held a 62% market share for hummus sales in the United States, and was forecast to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2017. To meet the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than in 2015, an increase from in 2009. Hummus consumption has been so popular, many tobacco farmers have switched to growing chickpeas to meet demand. Culture In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned to the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries.Karam, Zeina, \\"Hummus war looms between Lebanon and Israel \\", Associated Press, 7 October 2008. Retrieved 10 December 2008. As of late 2009, the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still \\"collecting documents and proof\\" to support its claim. The 2005 short film West Bank Story features a rivalry between two fictional restaurants, the Israeli \\"Kosher King\\" and the Palestinian \\"Hummus Hut\\". A parody of West Side Story, which is itself an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, the film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In 2012, Australian filmmaker Trevor Graham released a documentary, Make Hummus Not War, on the political and gastronomic aspects of hummus. In May 2010, the Guinness World Record for the largest dish of hummus in the world returned to Lebanon. The winning dish, cooked by 300 cooks in the village of al-Fanar, near Beirut, weighed approximately , more than double the weight of the previous record. According to local media, the recipe included eight tons of boiled chick peas, two tonnes of tahini, two tonnes of lemon juice, and of olive oil.

Life During Caesar's Civil War, Ahenobarbus was captured with his father, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, at Corfinium in 49 BC, and was present at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, but did not take any further part in the war. He did not however return to Italy until 46 BC, when he was pardoned by Julius Caesar. He probably played no part in Caesar's assassination, although some writers claim that he was one of the conspirators. He followed Brutus into Macedonia after Caesar's death, and was condemned by the Lex Pedia in 43 BC as one of the murderers. In 42 BC he commanded a fleet of fifty ships in the Ionian sea, and gained considerable success against the Second Triumvirate, completely defeating Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus on the day of the first battle of Philippi, as the latter attempted to sail out of Brundisium. He was saluted Imperator in consequence, and a record of this victory is preserved in the annexed coin, which represents a trophy placed upon the prow of a vessel. The head on the other side of the coin has a beard, in reference to the reputed origin of the Ahenobarbus family. After the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, Ahenobarbus conducted the war independently of Sextus Pompey, and with a fleet of seventy ships and two legions plundered the coasts of the Ionian Sea. In 40 BC, through the mediation of Gaius Asinius Pollio, Ahenobarbus became reconciled to Mark Antony, which greatly offended Octavianus. In the peace concluded with Sextus Pompeius in 39 BC, Antony provided for the safety of Ahenobarbus, and obtained for him the promise of the consulship for 32 BC. Ahenobarbus accompanied Antony on his ill-fated invasion of Parthia in 36 BC; after one particularly devastating defeat, Antony was too despondent to boost the morale of his troops so he gave that duty to Ahenobarbus.Plutarch: Antony, c. 40 Antony placed him in command of Bithynia, which he governed until 35 BC or perhaps after. In 35 BC he supported Gaius Furnius, governor of Asia against Sextus Pompeius. He became consul, according to agreement, in 32 BC, in which year the open rupture took place between Antony and Augustus. With Gaius Sosius, Ahenobarbus fled from Rome to Antony at Ephesus, where he found Cleopatra with him, and endeavoured, in vain, to obtain her removal from the army. Many of the soldiers, disgusted with the conduct of Antony, offered the command to Ahenobarbus, but he preferred to desert the party altogether, and defected to Augustus shortly before the battle of Actium in 31 BC. Even though he was suffering from a fever, he took a small boat to Augustus's side. Even though Antony was greatly upset, he still sent him all his gear, his friends and his attendants.Plutarch, Antony, c. 63 He was not, however, present at the battle itself, as he died a few days after joining Augustus. Plutarch suggests that his death was due to \\"the shame of his disloyalty and treachery being exposed.\\" Suetonius says that he was the best of his family.Cicero, Phil. ii. 11, x. 6, Brut. 25, ad Fam. vi. 22Appian, B. C. v. 55, 63, 65Cassius Dio, lib. xlvii.‚ÄîlMarcus Velleius Paterculus, ii. 763 84Suetonius, Nero 3Tacitus, Annales iv. 44 Family Ahenobarbus's father, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, had been Consul in 54 BC. His mother was Porcia Catonis, sister of Cato the Younger and half-sister of the two Servilias: Servilia Major (Caesar's mistress) and Servilia Minor (second wife of Lucullus). His wife was Aemilia Lepida and their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was married to Antonia Major, daughter of Mark Antony by Octavia.Plutarch: Antony, c. 87 They became parents to a younger Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, and grandparents of the Roman Emperor Nero.  Cultural depictions  The character of Domitius Enobarbus in the play Antony and Cleopatra is loosely based on this man. He is Antony's friend who deserts Antony for Caesar (Act III, sc. 13), is stricken with remorse (Act IV, sc. 6), and dies (Act IV, sc. 9).

The inscription means: \\"Antonia Major, Emperor Nero's grandmother.\\" Antonia the Elder (;PIR2 A 884 born August/September 39 BC) was a daughter of Triumvir Mark Antony and Octavia the Younger and a relative of the first Roman emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. She was a niece of the first emperor Augustus, step cousin of the emperor Tiberius, paternal great-aunt of the emperor Caligula, maternal aunt of emperor Claudius, and paternal grandmother and maternal great-great aunt of the emperor Nero. Biography Antonia was born in Athens, Greece and after 36 BC her mother, along with her siblings and herself were brought to Rome. She was raised by her mother, her uncle and her aunt Livia Drusilla. According to Cassius Dio after her father died, Augustus allowed her and her younger sister Antonia Minor to benefit from their father's estate in Rome. Although little is known of her, Antonia was held in high regard like her sister Antonia Minor, the mother of the emperor Claudius, who was celebrated for her beauty and virtue. Issue Around 22 BC Antonia married the consul Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Antonia bore Lucius three children: * Domitia Lepida the Elder - ancient sources refer to her as Domitia. She married the consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa and bore him a son Quintus Haterius Antoninus. Domitia later married Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus, consul suffect in 27, proconsul of Asia and consul in AD 44. * Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (PIR2 D127) - consul in AD 32, he married his cousin Germanicus' daughter Agrippina the Younger in 28. Agrippina and Domitius were the parents of the emperor Nero. He was accused by Tiberius, but saved by that emperor's death (Suet. Nero 5) and lived a few years longer under Caligula's reign until he died in AD 40. * Domitia Lepida the Younger (PIR2 D180) - she first married her cousin, the consul Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus to whom she bore a daughter, the empress Valeria Messalina, third wife of the emperor Claudius. After the death of her first husband, she married Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus, suffect consul in AD 31, and gave him a son, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix (who would become consul in AD 52). At the beginning of Claudius' reign, she married Appius Junius Silanus, consul in AD 28, who was put to death in AD 42. She outlived her daughter, Messalina. Cultural depictions Many scholars think the Ara Pacis (an altar from the Augustan Era), displays Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and his elder sister Domitia. The woman behind Domitia and Domitius is allegedly their mother Antonia Major and the man next to Antonia Major is her husband Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.

He was acclaimed as Canada's poet laureateNot to be confused with the official title of Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate which exists since 2001. during his later years. In Canada, Carman is classed as one of the Confederation Poets, a group which also included Charles G.D. Roberts (his cousin), Archibald Lampman, and Duncan Campbell Scott.. \\"Of the group, Carman had the surest lyric touch and achieved the widest international recognition. But unlike others, he never attempted to secure his income by novel writing, popular journalism, or non-literary employment. He remained a poet, supplementing his art with critical commentaries on literary ideas, philosophy, and aesthetics.\\" Life He was born William Bliss Carman in Fredericton, New Brunswick. \\"Bliss\\" was his mother's maiden name. He was the great grandsonOf Loyalist Richard Carman who landed in Saint John NB in 1783, according to Carman Family Scrapbook #2, microfilm F10048 at New Brunswich Archives, scrapbook compiled by the Rev. Wm. O. Raymond, undated but likely around 1900 http://archives.gnb.ca/Archives/Default.aspx?culture=en-CA of United Empire Loyalists who fled to Nova Scotia after the American Revolution, settling in New Brunswick (then part of Nova Scotia). His literary roots run deep with an ancestry that includes a mother who was a descendant of Daniel Bliss of Concord, Massachusetts, the great-grandfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson. His sister, Jean, married the botanist and historian William Francis Ganong. And on his mother's side he was a first cousin to Charles (later Sir Charles) G. D. Roberts. =Education and early career= Carman was educated at the Fredericton Collegiate School and the University of New Brunswick (UNB), from which he received a B.A. in 1881. At the Collegiate School he came under the influence of headmaster George Robert Parkin, who gave him a love of classical literature and introduced him to the poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. His first published poem was in the UNB Monthly in 1879. He then spent a year at Oxford and the University of Edinburgh (1882‚Äì1883), but returned home to receive his M.A. from UNB in 1884.Kelsey Allan, \\"William Bliss Carman,\\" New Brunswick Literary Encyclopedia, STU.ca, Web, Apr. 16, 2011. After the death of his father in January 1885 and his mother in February 1886, Carman enrolled in Harvard University (1886‚Äì1887). At Harvard he moved in a literary circle that included American poet Richard Hovey, who would become his close friend and his collaborator on the successful Vagabondia poetry series. Carman and Hovey were members of the \\"Visionists\\" circle along with Herbert Copeland and F. Holland Day, who would later form the Boston publishing firm Copeland & Day that would launch Vagabondia. After Harvard Carman briefly returned to Canada, but was back in Boston by February 1890. \\"Boston is one of the few places where my critical education and tastes could be of any use to me in earning money,\\" he wrote. \\"New York and London are about the only other places.\\" Unable to find employment in Boston, he moved to New York City and became literary editor of the New York Independent at the grand sum of $20/week. There he could help his Canadian friends get published, in the process \\"introducing Canadian poets to its readers.\\" However, Carman was never a good fit at the semi-religious weekly, and he was summarily dismissed in 1892. \\"Brief stints would follow with Current Literature, Cosmopolitan, The Chap-Book, and The Atlantic Monthly, but after 1895 he would be strictly a contributor to the magazines and newspapers, never an editor in any department.\\" To make matters worse, Carman's first book of poetry, 1893's Low Tide on Grand Pr√©, was not a success; no Canadian company would publish it, and the U.S. edition stiffed when its publisher went bankrupt. =Literary success= At this low point, Songs of Vagabondia, the first Hovey-Carman collaboration, was published by Copeland & Day in 1894. It was an immediate success. \\"No one could have been more surprised at the tremendous popularity of these care-free celebrations (the first of the three collections went through seven rapid editions) than the young authors, Richard Hovey and Bliss Carman.\\". Songs of Vagabondia would ultimately \\"go through sixteen printings (ranging from 500 to 1000 copies) over the next thirty years. The three Vagabondia volumes that followed fell slightly short of that record, but each went through numerous printings. Carman and Hovey quickly found themselves with a cult following, especially among college students, who responded to the poetry's anti-materialistic themes, its celebration of individual freedom, and its glorification of comradeship.\\" The success of Songs of Vagabondia prompted another Boston firm, Stone & Kimball, to reissue Low Tide... and to hire Carman as the editor of its literary journal, The Chapbook. The next year, though, the editor's job went West (with Stone & Kimball) to Chicago, while Carman opted to remain in Boston. \\"In Boston in 1895, he worked on a new poetry book, Behind the Arras, which he placed with a prominent Boston publisher (Lamson, Wolffe).... He published two more books of verse with Lamson, Wolffe.\\" He also began writing a weekly column for the Boston Evening Transcript, which ran from 1895 to 1900. In 1896 Carman met Mary Perry King, who became the greatest and longest- lasting female influence in his life. Mrs. King became his patron: \\"She put pence in his purse, and food in his mouth, when he struck bottom and, what is more, she often put a song on his lips when he despaired, and helped him sell it.\\" According to Carman's roommate, Mitchell Kennerley, \\"On rare occasions they had intimate relations at 10 E. 16 which they always advised me of by leaving a bunch of violets ‚Äî Mary Perry's favorite flower ‚Äî on the pillow of my bed.\\" If he knew of the latter, Dr. King did not object: \\"He even supported her involvement in the career of Bliss Carman to the extent that the situation developed into something close to a m√©nage √† trois\\" with the Kings. Through Mrs. King's influence Carman became an advocate of 'unitrinianism,' a philosophy which \\"drew on the theories of Fran√ßois-Alexandre-Nicolas-Ch√©ri Delsarte to develop a strategy of mind-body-spirit harmonization aimed at undoing the physical, psychological, and spiritual damage caused by urban modernity.\\" This shared belief created a bond between Mrs. King and Carman but estranged him somewhat from his former friends. In 1899 Lamson, Wolffe was taken over by the Boston firm of Small, Maynard & Co., who had also acquired the rights to Low Tide... \\"The rights to all Carman's books were now held by one publisher and, in lieu of earnings, Carman took a financial stake in the company. When Small, Maynard failed in 1903, Carman lost all his assets.\\" Down but not out, Carman signed with another Boston company, L.C. Page, and began to churn out new work. Page published seven books of new Carman poetry between 1902 and 1905. As well, the firm released three books based on Carman's Transcript columns, and a prose work on unitrinianism, The Making of Personality, that he'd written with Mrs. King. \\"Page also helped Carman rescue his 'dream project,' a deluxe edition of his collected poetry to 1903.... Page acquired distribution rights with the stipulation that the book be sold privately, by subscription. The project failed; Carman was deeply disappointed and became disenchanted with Page, whose grip on Carman's copyrights would prevent the publication of another collected edition during Carman's lifetime.\\" Carman also picked up some needed cash in 1904 as editor-in-chief of the 10-volume project, The World's Best Poetry. =Later years= Bliss Carman Memorial, Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredericton NB After 1908 Carman lived near the Kings' New Canaan, Connecticut, estate, \\"Sunshine\\", or in the summer in a cabin near their summer home in the Catskills, \\"Moonshine.\\" Between 1908 and 1920, literary taste began to shift, and his fortunes and health declined. \\"Although not a political activist, Carman during the First World War was a member of the Vigilantes, who supported American entry into the conflict on the Allied side.\\" By 1920, Carman was impoverished and recovering from a near- fatal attack of tuberculosis. That year he revisited Canada and \\"began the first of a series of successful and relatively lucrative reading tours, discovering 'there is nothing worth talking of in book sales compared with reading.'\\" \\"'Breathless attention, crowded halls, and a strange, profound enthusiasm such as I never guessed could be,' he reported to a friend. 'And good thrifty money too. Think of it! An entirely new life for me, and I am the most surprised person in Canada.'\\" Carman was feted at \\"a dinner held by the newly formed Canadian Authors' Association at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Montreal on 28 October 1921 where he was crowned Canada's Poet Laureate with a wreath of maple leaves.\\" The tours of Canada continued, and by 1925 Carman had finally acquired a Canadian publisher. \\"McClelland & Stewart (Toronto) issued a collection of selected earlier verses and became his main publisher. They benefited from Carman's popularity and his revered position in Canadian literature, but no one could convince L.C. Page to relinquish its copyrights. An edition of collected poetry was published only after Carman's death, due greatly to the persistence of his literary executor, Lorne Pierce.\\" During the 1920s, Carman was a member of the Halifax literary and social set, The Song Fishermen. In 1927 he edited The Oxford Book of American Verse. Carman died of a brain hemorrhage at the age of 68 in New Canaan, and was cremated in New Canaan. \\"It took two months, and the influence of New Brunswick's Premier J.B.M. Baxter and Canadian Prime Minister W.L.M. King, for Carman's ashes to be returned to Fredericton.\\" \\"His ashes were buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredericton, and a national memorial service was held at the Anglican cathedral there.\\" Twenty-five years later, on May 13, 1954, a scarlet maple tree was planted at his gravesite, to grant his request in his 1892 poem \\"The Grave-Tree\\": :::Let me have a scarlet maple :::For the grave-tree at my head, :::With the quiet sun behind it, :::In the years when I am dead. Writing =Low Tide on Grand Pr√©= As a student at Harvard, Carman \\"was heavily influenced by Royce, whose spiritualistic idealism, combined with the transcendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson, lies centrally in the background of his first major poem, \\"Low Tide on Grand Pr√©\\" written in the summer and winter of 1886.\\" \\"Low Tide...\\" was published in the Spring, 1887 Atlantic Monthly, giving Carman a literary reputation while still at Harvard. It was also included in the 1889 anthology, Songs of the Great Dominion. Literary critic Desmond Pacey considered \\"Low Tide...\\" to be \\"the most nearly perfect single poem to come out of Canada. It will withstand any amount of critical scrutiny.\\" \\"Low Tide...\\" served as the title poem for Carman's first book. \\"The poems in this volume have been collected with reference to their similarity of tone,\\" Carman wrote in his preface; a nostalgic tone of pervading loss and melancholy. Three outstanding examples are \\"The Eavesdropper,\\" \\"In Apple Time\\" and \\"Wayfaring.\\" However, \\"none can equal the artistry of the title poem. What is more, although Carman would publish over thirty other volumes during his lifetime, none of them contains anything that surpasses this poem he wrote when he was barely twenty-five years old.\\" =Vagabondia= Carman rose to prominence in the 1890s, a decade the poetry of which anthologist Louis Untermeyer has called marked by \\"a cheerless evasion, a humorous unconcern; its most representative craftsmen were, with four exceptions, the writers of light verse.\\" The first two of those four exceptions were Richard Hovey and Bliss Carman. For Untermeyer: \\"The poetry of this period ... is dead because it detached itself from the world.... But ... revolt openly declared itself with the publication of Songs from Vagabondia (1894), More Songs from Vagabondia (1896), and Last Songs from Vagabondia (1900).... It was the heartiness, the gypsy jollity, the rush of high spirits, that conquered. Readers of the Vagabondia books were swept along by their speed faster than by their philosophy.\\"Untermayer (1921), p. xxviii Even modernists loved Vagabondia. In the \\"October, 1912 issue of the London Poetry Review, Ezra Pound noted that he had 'greatly enjoyed The Songs of Vagabondia by Mr. Bliss Carman and the late Richard Hovey.'\\" Carman's most famous poem from the first volume is arguably \\"The Joys of the Open Road.\\" More Songs... contains \\"A Vagabond Song,\\" once familiar to a generation of Canadians. \\"Canadian youngsters who were in grade seven anytime between the mid-1930s and the 1950s were probably exposed to ... 'A Vagabond Song' [which] appeared in The Canada Book of Prose and Verse, Book One, the school reader that was used in nearly every province\\" (and was edited by Lorne Pierce). In 1912 Carman would publish Echoes from Vagabondia as a solo work. (Hovey had died in 1900). More of a remembrance book than part of the set, it has a distinct elegiac tone. It contains the lyric \\"The Flute of Spring\\". =Behind the Arras= With Behind the Arras (1895), Carman continued his practice of \\"bringing together poems that were 'in the same key.' Whereas Low Tide on Grand Pr√© is elegiacal and melancholy, Songs from Vagabondia is mostly light and jaunty, while Behind the Arras is philosophical and heavy.\\" \\"Behind the Arras\\" the poem is a long meditation that uses the speaker's house and its many rooms as a symbol of life and its choices. The poem does not succeed: \\"there are so many asides that the allegory is lost along with any point the poet hoped to make.\\" =Ballad of Lost Haven= In keeping with the \\"same key\\" idea, Carman's Ballad of Lost Haven (1897) was a collection of poetry about the sea. Its notable poems include the macabre sea shanty, The Gravedigger. =By the Aurelian Wall= \\"By the Aurelian Wall\\" is Carman's elegy to John Keats. It served as the title poem of his 1898 collection, a book of formal elegies. In the last poem in the book, \\"The Grave-Tree,\\" Carman writes about his own death. =The Pipes of Pan= \\"Pan, the goat-god, traditionally associated with poetry and with the fusion of the earthly and the divine, becomes Carman's organizing symbol in the five volumes issued between 1902 and 1905\\" under the above title. Under the influence of Mrs. King, Carman had begun to write in both prose and poetry about the ideas of 'unitrinianism,' \\"a strategy of mind-body-spirit harmonization aimed at undoing the physical, psychological, and spiritual damage caused by urban modernity ... therapeutic ideas [which] resulted in the five volumes of verse assembled in Pipes of Pan.\\" The Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB) calls the series \\"a collection that contains many superb lyrics but, overall, evinces the dangers of a soporific aesthetic.\\" The 'superb lyrics' include the much-anthologized \\"The Dead Faun\\" from Volume I, From the Book of Myths; \\"From the Green Book of the Bards\\", the title poem of Volume II; \\"Lord of My Heart's Elation\\" from the same volume; and many of the erotic poems of Volume III, Songs of the Sea Children (such as LIX \\"I loved you when the tide of prayer\\"). As a whole, though, the Pan series shows (perhaps more than any other work) the truth of Northrop Frye's 1954 observation that Carman \\"badly needs a skillful and sympathetic selection.\\" =Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics= First edition of Sappho, 1904. There were no such problems with Carman's next book. Perhaps because of the underlying concept, Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics (1904) has a structure and unity that helps make it what has been called Carman's \\"finest volume of poetry.\\" Sappho was an Ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos, who was included in the Greek canon of nine lyric poets. Most of her poetry, which was well-known and greatly admired throughout antiquity, has been lost, but her reputation has endured, supported by the surviving fragments of some of her poems. Carman's method, as Charles G.D. Roberts saw it in his Introduction to the book,\\"apparently, has been to imagine each lost lyric as discovered, and then to translate it; for the indefinable flavor of the translation is maintained throughout, though accompanied by the fluidity and freedom of purely original work.\\" It was a daunting task, as Roberts admits: \\"It is as if a sculptor of to-day were to set himself, with reverence, and trained craftsmanship, and studious familiarity with the spirit, technique, and atmosphere of his subject, to restore some statues of Polyclitus or Praxiteles of which he had but a broken arm, a foot, a knee, a finger upon which to build.\\" Yet, on the whole, Carman succeeded. \\"Written more or less contemporaneously with the love poems in Songs of the Sea Children, the Sappho reconstructions continue the amorous theme from a feminine point of view. Nevertheless, the feelings ascribed to Sappho are pure Carman in their sensitive and elegiac melancholy.\\" Virtually all of the lyrics are of high quality; some often-quoted are XXIII (\\"I loved thee, Atthis, in the long ago,\\"), LIV (\\"How soon will all my lovely days be over\\"), LXXIV (\\"If death be good\\"), LXXXII (\\"Over the roofs the honey-coloured moon\\"). \\"Next to Low Tide on Grand Pr√©, Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics seems to be the collection that continues to find the most favour among Carman's critics.

Bentley, for example, calls it 'undoubtedly one of the most attractive, engaging and satisfying works of any of the Confederation poets.'\\" Bentley argued that \\"the brief, crisp lyrics of the Sappho volume almost certainly contributed to the aesthetic and practice of Imagism. =Later work= In his review of 1954's Selected Poems of Bliss Carman, literary critic Northrop Frye compared Carman and the other Confederation Poets to the Group of Seven: \\"Like the later painters, these poets were lyrical in tone and romantic in attitude; like the painters, they sought for the most part uninhabited landscape.\\" But Frye added: \\"The lyrical response to landscape is by itself, however, a kind of emotional photography, and like other forms of photography is occasional and epigrammatic.... Hence the lyric poet, after he has run his gamut of impressions, must die young, develop a more intellectualized attitude, or start repeating himself. Carman's meeting of this challenge was only partly successful.\\" It is true that Carman had begun to repeat himself after Sappho. \\"Much of Carman's writing in poetry and prose during the decade preceding World War I is as repetitive as the title of Echoes from Vagabondia (1912) intimates\\" says the DCB. What had made his poetry so remarkable at the beginning - that every new book was completely new - was gone. However, Carman's career was by no means over. He \\"published four other collections of new poetry during his lifetime and two more were ready for publication at the time of his death: The Rough Rider, and Other Poems (1908), A Painter's Holiday, and Other Poems (1911), April Airs (1916), Far Horizons (1925), Sanctuary (1929), and Wild Garden (1929). James Cappon's comment on Far Horizons applies almost equally to the other five volumes: 'There is nothing new in its poetic quality which has the sweet sadness of age rehearsing old tunes with an art which is now very smooth though with less vivacity than it used to have.'\\" Not only did Carman continue to write, but he continued to write fine poems: poems such as \\"The Old Grey Wall\\" (April Airs), the Wilfred Campbell-ish \\"Rivers of Canada\\" (Far Horizons), \\"The Ghost-yard of the Goldenrod\\" and \\"The Ships of Saint John\\" (Later Poems, 1926), and \\"The Winter Scene\\" (Sanctuary: The \\"Sunshine House\\" sonnets). The best of these have the same nostalgic air of melancholy and loss with which Carman began in \\"Low Tide...,\\" but now even more poignant as the poet approached his own death. Recognition In 1906 Carman received honorary degrees from UNB and McGill University. He was elected a corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1925. The Society awarded him its Lorne Pierce Gold Medal in 1928. He was awarded a medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1929. In 1945, Carman was recognized as a Person of National Historic Significance by the government of Canada. Carman is honored by a sculpture erected on the UNB campus in 1947, which portrays him with fellow poets Sir Charles G.D. Roberts and Francis Joseph Sherman. Bliss Carman Middle School in Fredericton, New Brunswick and Bliss Carman Senior Public School in Toronto, Ontario were named after him. \\"Bliss Carman Heights\\" (an extension of the Skyline Acres subdivision) is a subdivision located in Fredericton, New Brunswick overlooking the Saint John River. It consists of Essex Street, Gloucester Crescent, Reading Street, Ascot Court, and Ascot Drive. An extension of the Bliss Carman Heights subdivision is named \\"Poet's Hill\\" and consists of Bliss Carman Drive, Poets Lane and Windflower Court (named for one of Carman's poems of the same name). In October 1916, American composer Leo Sowerby was inspired to write his best-known organ piece, \\"Comes Autumn Time,\\" after reading Carman's poem, \\"Autumn,\\" in the Literature section of the Sunday Edition of the Chicago Tribune on October 16 of that year. \\"Autumn\\" was reprinted from The Atlantic on page 6 of the Chicago Daily Tribune on October 5, 1916.

For a time he was considered his father's heir, but that changed after his mother's downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius' knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina's son, Lucius Domitius, whose name became Nero as a result. His step-brother would later be married to his sister Octavia, and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' heir. Following his father's death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as being the result of poisoning on Nero's orders‚Äîas Claudius' natural son, he represented a threat to Nero's claim to the throne. Name Britannicus' name at birth was Tiberius Claudius Germanicus. The agnomen, his first surname Germanicus, was first awarded to his paternal grandfather Drusus the Elder after his death in 9 BC to commemorate his victories over the Germanic tribes. Accordingly, Drusus' sons (Claudius and Germanicus) inherited the name and passed it to their sons as well. Britannicus was given to his father in AD 43 following his conquest of Britain. Claudius never used it himself and gave the name to his son instead, and his full name became: Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus. He came to be known by his new name which seems to have replaced Germanicus altogether.Cassius Dio, Roman History LV.2 for Germanicus; Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.22 for Britannicus Background and family A sestertius issued to commemorate Britannicus' birth Britannicus was born on or about 12 February 41 in Rome, to Emperor Claudius and his third wife Valeria Messalina. As such, he was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, specifically of the gens Claudia. It is uncertain what the exact date of Britannicus' birthday was, with the earliest possible date being early 39 or 40, and the latest as AD 42. The year 41 is widely accepted due to the fact that Britannicus was almost 14, and therefore on the cusp of assuming the toga virilis, when he was killed in 55 . The day 12 February is based on the testimony of Suetonius that Britannicus was born on the twenty- second day of his fathers' reign. (Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius, 27 ). Britannicus' father had been reigning for less than a month, and his position was boosted greatly by the birth of an heir. To mark the birth, the emperor issued sestertii with the obverse Spes Augusta ‚Äì the hope of the imperial family. Britannicus had four siblings: a half-brother, Claudius Drusus, by Claudius' first wife (Plautia Urgulanilla) who died at the age of 3 or 4; a half-sister, Antonia, by Claudius' second wife (Aelia Paetina); a sister by the same mother named Octavia; and an adoptive brother, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future emperor Nero), who was adopted in AD 49 and renamed Nero Claudius Caesar as a result. Two years later, in 43, Claudius was granted the honorific \\"Britannicus\\" by the senate as a reward for his conquest of Britain. The emperor never used the name himself, but allowed his son to inherit it. This is the name by which the boy became known to posterity. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, a Roman historian writing from the late first century, says that Claudius adored Britannicus, carrying him around at public events, and \\"would wish him happy auspices, joined by the applauding throng.\\"Suetonius, Life of Claudius, 27 During his father's marriage to Messalina =Education= Britannicus was tutored by Sosibius, who was a close associate of Publius Suillius Rufus and a friend of his mother. He was educated alongside Titus Vespasianus, the future emperor of Rome. They were brought up together and taught similar subjects by the same tutors.Suetonius, Life of Titus, 2 In 47, Sosibius gave Claudius a reminder of the power and wealth which threatened the Emperor's throne. His tutor then, as part of his mother's contrivances, told the emperor of Decimus Valerius Asiaticus's involvement in the murder of Caligula and of his growing popularity in Rome. Sosibius went on, saying Asiaticus meant to rally Roman legions in Germany against the throne. Asiaticus was apprehended immediately, and brought to Rome in chains.Tacitus, XI.1 Sullius successfully pursued charges against other equestrians in the Senate.Tacitus, XI.2‚Äì3 According to Cassius Dio, Asiaticus was put to death as a favor to Messalina for his property (the Gardens of Lucullus).Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.29 It was later voted by the Senate that Sosibius be given a million sesterces for giving Britannicus the benefit of his teachings and Claudius that of his counsel (i.e. for his involvement in the case against Asiaticus).Tacitus, XI.4 =Fall of Messalina= Messalina holding her son Britannicus, Louvre Brittanicus took part in the celebrations of Rome's 800th anniversary (48). It was the sixth ever Ludi Saeculares (\\"Secular Games\\") and sixty-four years since the last one held in the summer of 17 BC by Augustus. Britannicus' father was there as was Lucius Domitius and his mother Agrippina who were the last surviving descendants of Germanicus. Claudius watched the young nobility, including Britannicus and Domitius, enact the Battle of Troy in the circus. Tacitus says Domitius was greeted with more enthusiasm than Britannicus.Tacitus claims the enthusiasm in which the future emperor Nero was greeted is a sign of his greatness. He wrote during the reign of Nero and in this same passage claims to have overseen the seventh Ludi Saeculares as it was his duty being a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis and holding the title of praetor (Tacitus, The Annals, XI.11‚Äì12).Tacitus, The Annals, XI.11 The games were seen as the introduction of Agrippina and Domitius to public life, and Brittanicus's mother Messalina must have been aware of this and envious of Agrippina. Tacitus writes that Messalina was too busy engaging in an \\"insane\\" affair to plot the destruction of Agrippina. He says:Tacitus, The Annals, XI.12 The affair continued into the next year. It was then that the affair between Messalina and Silius took a new turn. Silius, who had no children of his own, proposed to marry Messalina on condition that she allow him to adopt Britannicus.In the account of Cassius Dio, she proposed to marry him as she not only wanted to have affairs, but to hold many husbands as well. She also grants him a royal residence and grants him a consulship (Dio, LX.31). The plan was to overthrow Claudius and rule together as regents of Britannicus. She acquiesced and waited for Claudius to leave Rome before performing the sacrifice and entering the bigamous marriage. The illegal union was made known to Claudius by Callistus and Narcissus, freedmen in his service. Claudius had Messalina, Silius, and others who knew of the affair put to death. Messalina was given a knife to kill herself with, though a tribune of the Praetorian Guard had to force it through her neck. Images and statues of Silius and his associates were ordered to be destroyed.Tacitus, The Annales, XI.29‚Äì38Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.31 During his father's marriage to Agrippina The fall of Silius and Messalina opened the way for Agrippina the Younger to become his father's fourth wife. His father claimed to be uninterested in another marriage,Suetonius, Life of Claudius 26 but it wouldn't be long. Unlike his uncle Germanicus, his father had never been adopted into the Julii. Claudius thought marrying his niece would bring his family closer to that of Augustus, as Agrippina and Domitius were the last living descendants of Germanicus. So, in 49, despite a marriage between uncle and niece being incestuous under Roman law, his father remarried. =Rise of Nero= Bust of the young Nero In 49, during the term of consul-elect Mammius Pollio (March‚ÄìJune), Domitius was betrothed to his sister Octavia and thus became his equal in rank. Tacitus suggests this move had the support of those who feared the vengeance of Britannicus against those who wronged his mother.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.9 Through the insistence of Pallas, his father was convinced to adopt Domitius as his son. Claudius was convinced to do as Augustus had done in adopting Gaius and Lucius Caesar, and as Tiberius had done in adopting Germanicus despite having a son already. It was in February 50 that his father passed a law adopting Domitius into the Claudii and naming him Nero, and Domitius became \\"Nero Claudius Caesar\\". Nero and Britannicus then became joint-heirs to the emperor, and Agrippina was then given the title of Augusta.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.25‚Äì26 In AD 51, his brother Nero assumed the toga virilis despite not yet being 14. The Senate also decided then that Nero should hold the consulship during his twentieth year (AD 56) and, as consul-elect, that he should enjoy imperium proconsulare (\\"proconsular authority\\") beyond the limits of Rome with the title of princeps iuventutis (\\"prince of the youth of Rome\\"). The progress of Nero seems to have followed in the footsteps of Gaius and Lucius Caesar. To mark the occasion, a donative was given to the soldiery of Rome, and presents to the people. His step-brother's status, along with that of Agrippina, is echoed on contemporary coinage.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.41 By contrast, Britannicus was progressively isolated. At the games of the circus Nero appeared in triumphal robes while Britannicus was still dressed as a boy. Tacitus says their clothing at the games affected the expectations of the people: with Nero in a general's clothing, and Britannicus in the dress of boyhood. He wouldn't be due for the toga until 12 February AD 55. He and his supporters were seen as a potential problem for Nero. Agrippina replaced his tutors with her own nominees, having convinced Claudius to order their executions, including the execution of Sosibius.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.32 Not just his tutors, but the two prefects of the Praetorian Guard, Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus, were replaced as well. They were thought to be sympathetic to the cause of Britannicus and his mother, as Tacitus reports: it would have been risky to surround Nero with any but those loyal to Claudius and Agrippina. His step-mother had them replaced with Sextus Afranius Burrus who was a good soldier, but knew to whom he owed his allegiance.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.42 Nero's career progressed steadily: he gave speeches in AD 51 and 52. The speech in 51 thanked the emperor for honours given to him, and that of 52 was a vow for the safe recovery of the emperor from illness. It was in 53 that Nero married Britannicus' sister Octavia, who first had to be legally transferred to another family to obviate charges of incest.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.33 By this time it became clear that Nero was the unambiguous designate. His step-brother became more politically active following his marriage to Octavia: he exempted the people of Ilium from all public burdens arguing that Rome was descended from Troy through Aeneas (the founder of the Julian line), procured funds for the colony of Bononia (modern Bologna, Italy) which had been devastated by fire, and the people of Rhodes had their freedom restored.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.58 Meanwhile, Britannicus himself was kept in reserve in case Nero died, with deaths of princes being recent (such as Tiberius Gemellus). Though Nero was clearly the heir-designate, he was not named princeps designate to avoid hurting both Republican sentiment and the Augustan compromise of a principate that lay between monarchy and magistracy. Death of his father, Claudius Suetonius reports that Claudius wished Rome to have a \\"real Caesar\\", and Britannicus enjoyed support from Claudius' loyal and influential freedman, Narcissus. There are possible signs of support for Britannicus seen on coins from Moesia and North Africa, placing Britannicus' head and title on the obverse side. Claudius became aware of his wife's actions and began preparing for the end of her power. His father wished to bestow upon him the toga, and to declare Britannicus as his heir. According to Suetonius, when Claudius mentioned his intention to give Britannicus the toga of manhood he said, \\"That the Roman people may at last have a genuine Caesar.\\"Cassius Dio, Roman History, LX.34Tacitus, The Annales, XII.65‚Äì69 The actions Claudius took to preserve his rule in the short-term were not easily undone as Britannicus approached manhood. In late 54, Britannicus was within 6 months of reaching manhood by Roman tradition, and had matured early. According to the historian Suetonius, Claudius began to mention divorcing Agrippina and dismissing Nero now that he was no longer needed. In preparation, Claudius commended both his son and adopted son to the Senate as equals in his last Senate address. Suetonius reports that Claudius now admonished his son to grow up quickly, implying that everything would be righted when he assumed the toga virilis.Suetonius, Life of Claudius, 43 On 13 October 54, Claudius died, either by natural causes or poison. In the accounts of his death by poison, Agrippina, aware of Claudius' intentions of placing Britannicus on the throne, had a well-known poisoner, Locusta, infuse mushrooms with poison that were fed to the emperor. There were those who preferred Britannicus over Nero, such as Claudius' freedman Narcissus.Tacitus, The Annales, XII.65 Unfortunately for his cause, Narcissus was away in Campania when the emperor was poisoned, while Britannicus and his sisters, Octavia and Antonia, were kept out of sight in their rooms by Agrippina. Consequently, none could challenge Nero's succession. If one thought that Britannicus' claim should take precedence, the response was that Nero too was the son of Claudius, with Agrippina linking him back to Augustus. It didn't help that many were convinced that Britannicus was no longer in the line of succession, a direct effect of the propaganda against him by Agrippina. Nero spoke the eulogy at the emperor's funeral and took sole power. Claudius' new will, which either granted joint-rule to Britannicus and Nero or just Britannicus, was suppressed by the new emperor's men in the senate.Barrett argues that Tacitus' reference to the will being suppressed so as to prevent outrage about Nero meant that the will did not name Nero as primary or sole heir. Therefore the Senate's elevation of Nero would have caused outrage if the will were read . Downfall Agrippina crowns her young son Nero with a laurel wreath. Immediately following the death of Claudius, Agrippina set upon removing those she had seen as a threat. Marcus Junius Silanus, proconsul of Asia whose brother Lucius had been eliminated by her as well, was poisoned for no other reason than that he had been the great-great-grandson of Augustus. Claudius' freedman Narcissus, Britannicus' champion according to Tacitus, had been driven to suicide after a harsh imprisonment. In Tacitus XIII, this was carried out by Agrippina against the wishes of Nero.Tacitus, The Annales, XIII.1 Before Nero's consulship in 55, Nero forbade the persecution of a Julius Densus, an equestrian whose partiality for Britannicus had been construed as a crime.Tacitus, The Annales, XIII.10 During his consulship, Nero had become more independent from his mother's influence. He began a relationship with a slave girl, and removed Pallas, a favorite of Agrippina, from his post as secretary of the treasury. In response, Agrippina threatened to champion the cause of Britannicus to keep her son in line.Tacitus, The Annales, XIII.12‚Äì17 In the account of Tacitus, Agrippina says to Nero:Tacitus, The Annales, XIII.14 Tacitus recounts Nero's numerous attempts to publicly undermine Britannicus' image. In one such attempt, during the feast of Saturn (the Saturnalia), he and Nero were playing a game among a group of their friends, and Nero chose Britannicus to sing a song with the expectation that Britannicus would embarrass himself. Britannicus however, not only avoided humiliation, but also generated sympathy amongst the guests, after singing a poem telling the tale of how he had been cast aside in favour of Nero. The young emperor immediately began plotting his step-brother's assassination. According to Suetonius, Nero moved against Britannicus, employing the same poisoner, Locusta, who had been hired to murder his father, Claudius. The first dose failed, and Nero decided to throw caution to the wind. In the account of Suetonius, he had Locusta brought to his room to mix a faster acting poison before his very eyes. After many tests on kids, there was a mixture that killed an animal instantly. Being pleased, Nero had the concoction brought immediately to the dining room.Suetonius, Life of Nero, 33 Britannicus was poisoned at a dinner party attended by his sister, Octavia, Agrippina, and several other notables. Tacitus' account of the event is as follows: Britannicus was given a hot drink, which was tested by a food taster, and when he asked for it to be cooled, the poison was added to it with the cold water. The substance was instantly effective, and he \\"lost alike both voice and breath.\\" Nero claimed to those present that Britannicus was merely suffering from an epileptic fit, and that he had been afflicted with the condition since childhood. He died sometime between December and his 14th birthday, on 11 February 55, when he was to assume manhood, and just four months after his father's death. For her service, the emperor had Locusta rewarded with large estates, and even sent her pupils. Post mortem Britannicus was cremated and his ashes placed with those of his father in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Nero held his funeral the very next day in the rain and gave no eulogy, saying it was \\"a tradition in the case of untimely deaths not to oppress the public with eulogies and processions.\\" Dio says that Nero had the corpse covered in gypsum to cover the effects of the poison on the skin. While he was being carried through the Forum, the rain had uncovered the body making plain to all who could see that he had been poisoned.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LXI.7 Author and historian Beacham considers Dio's account to be \\"theatrical\\". Given his and Nero's relationship, it was not surprising when Britannicus died just before his fourteenth birthday. Britannicus criticized Nero's singing voice, and referred to his adoptive brother by his original name of Lucius Domitius.Suetonius, Life of Nero, 7 In favoring Nero, Claudius sealed the fate of his son, and perhaps his own. Ominously for Agrippina, Seneca and Burrus did not complain: either they had been bought off, or regarded Britannicus' death as inevitable given his relationship with Nero. Instead, they concentrated on growing their influence with Nero. According to Suetonius, Britannicus was good friends with the future Emperor Titus, whose father Vespasian had commanded legions in Britain. As part of the Flavians' attempts to link themselves with the Julio-Claudians, Titus claimed that he had been seated with Britannicus on the night he was killed. He even claimed to have tasted the poison, which resulted in a serious and long illness. Titus would go on to erect a gold statue of his childhood friend, and issue coins in his memory.Suetonius, Life of Titus, 2 Britannicus in popular culture Britannicus is portrayed in Britannicus (1669) by French playwright Jean Racine. He was played by Graham Seed in I, Claudius, a 1976 television series by Jack Pulman. Ancestry Notes References Bibliography =Primary sources= *Dio Cassius. Historia Romanum.

The Bank was registered in Luxembourg with head offices in Karachi and London. A decade after opening, BCCI had over 400 branches in 78 countries and assets in excess of US$20 billion, making it the seventh largest private bank in the world. BCCI came under the scrutiny of financial regulators and intelligence agencies in the 1980s, due to concerns that it was poorly regulated. Subsequent investigations revealed that it was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes, and had illegally gained the controlling interest in a major American bank. BCCI became the focus of a massive regulatory battle in 1991, and, on 5 July of that year, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and locked down records of its branch offices. Investigators in the United States and the UK revealed that BCCI had been \\"set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection\\". The liquidators, Deloitte & Touche, filed a lawsuit against the bank's auditors, Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young, which was settled for $175 million in 1998. By 2013, Deloitte & Touche claimed to have recovered about 75% of the creditors' lost money. History BCCI's founder, Agha Hasan Abedi, established the bank in 1972. Abedi, a prolific banker, had previously set up the United Bank Limited in Pakistan in 1959 sponsored by Saigols. Preceding the nationalization of the United Bank in 1974, he sought to create a new supranational banking entity. BCCI was created with capital of which 25% was from the Bank of America and the remaining 75% from Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. BCCI expanded rapidly in the 1970s, pursuing long-term asset growth over profits, seeking high-net-worth individuals and regular large deposits. The company itself divided into BCCI Holdings with the bank under that splitting into BCCI SA (Luxembourg) and BCCI Overseas (Grand Cayman). BCCI also acquired parallel banks through acquisitions: buying the Banque de Commerce et Placements (BCP) of Geneva in 1976, and creating KIFCO (Kuwait International Finance Company), Credit & Finance Corporation Ltd, and a series of Cayman-based companies held together as ICIC (International Credit and Investment Company Overseas, International Credit and Commerce [Overseas], etc.). Overall, BCCI expanded from 19 branches in five countries in 1973 to 27 branches in 1974 and 108 branches by 1976, with assets growing from $200 million to $1.6 billion. This growth caused extensive underlying capital problems. The Guardian alleged that BCCI was using cash from deposits to fund operating expenses, rather than making investments. Investigative journalist and author Joseph J. Trento has argued that the bank's transformation was guided by the head of Saudi intelligence with a view to enabling it to finance covert American intelligence operations at a time, in the aftermath of Watergate, when the American intelligence agencies were defending themselves from investigations by domestic authorities. BCCI entered the African markets in 1979, and Asia in the early 1980s. BCCI was among the first foreign banks awarded a license to operate in the Chinese Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen which bore testament to Agha Hasan Abedi's public relations skills, a feat that had yet to be achieved by the likes of Citicorp and JP Morgan. Some of China's largest state banks were depositors in BCCI's Shenzhen branch. There was rigid compartmentalization; the 248 managers and general managers reported directly to Abedi and the CEO Swaleh Naqvi. It was structured in such a way that no single country had overall regulatory supervision over it so as not to hinder potential growth and expansion opportunities. Its two holding companies were based in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands two jurisdictions where banking regulation was notoriously weak. It was also not regulated by a country that had a central bank. On several occasions, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told the Federal Reserve in no uncertain terms that BCCI must not be allowed to buy any American bank because it was poorly regulated. By 1980, BCCI was reported to have assets of over $4 billion with over 150 branches in 46 countries. Bank of America was \\"bewildered\\" by BCCI and reduced its holding in 1980, and the company came to be held by a number of groups, with International Credit and Investment Corp ('ICIC') owning 70%. By 1989, ICIC's shareholding was reduced to 11% with Abu Dhabi groups holding almost 40%. However, large numbers of shares were held by BCCI nominees. In 1982, 15 Middle Eastern investors bought Financial General Bankshares, a large bank holding company headquartered in Washington, D.C. All the investors were BCCI clients, but the Fed received assurances that BCCI would be in no way involved in the management of the company, which was renamed First American Bankshares. To alleviate regulators' concerns, Clark Clifford, an adviser to five presidents, was named First American's chairman. Clifford headed a board composed of himself and several other distinguished American citizens, including former United States Senator Stuart Symington. In truth, BCCI had been involved in the purchase of FGB/First American from the beginning. Abedi had been approached about buying it as early as 1977, but by this time BCCI's reputation in the United States was so poor that it could not hope to buy an American bank on its own (as mentioned above, the OCC was adamantly opposed to BCCI being allowed to buy its way into the American banking industry). Rather, it used the First American investors as nominees. Moreover, Clifford's law firm was retained as general counsel, and also handled most of BCCI's American legal work. BCCI was also heavily involved in First American personnel matters. The relationship between the two was so close that rumors spread BCCI was the real owner of First American. BCCI had an unusual annual auditing system: Price Waterhouse were the accountants for BCCI Overseas, while Ernst & Young audited BCCI and BCCI Holdings (London and Luxembourg). Other companies such as KIFCO and ICIC were audited by neither. In October 1985, the Bank of England and the Monetary Institute of Luxembourg (Luxembourg's bank regulator) ordered BCCI to change to a single accountant, alarmed at reported BCCI losses on the commodities and financial markets. Price Waterhouse became the banks sole accountant in 1987. In 1990, a Price Waterhouse audit of BCCI revealed an unaccountable loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank approached Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who made good the loss in exchange for an increased shareholding of 78%. Much of BCCI's documentation was then transferred to Abu Dhabi. The audit also revealed numerous irregularities. Most seriously, BCCI had made a staggering $1.48 billion worth of loans to its own shareholders, who used BCCI stock as collateral. The audit also confirmed what many Americans who watched BCCI long suspected that BCCI secretly (and illegally) owned First American. When the Fed cleared the group of Arab investors to buy First American, it did so on condition that they supplement their personal funds with money borrowed from banks with no connection to BCCI. Contrary to that agreement, several stockholders had borrowed heavily from BCCI. Even more seriously, they pledged their First American stock as collateral. When they didn't make interest payments, BCCI took control of the shares. It was later estimated that in this manner, BCCI had ended up with 60 percent or more of First American's stock. Despite these problems, Price Waterhouse signed BCCI's 1989 annual report, largely due to Zayed's firm commitment to propping up the bank. Abedi was succeeded by Swaleh Naqvi as the bank's chief, who, in the aftermath following controversy over BCCI, was replaced by Zafar Iqbal Chaudhry in the late 1990s. Lending practices BCCI contended that its growth was fueled by the increasingly large number of deposits by oil-rich states that owned stock in the bank as well as by sovereign developing nations. However, this claim failed to mollify the regulators. For example, the Bank of England ordered BCCI to cap its branch network in the United Kingdom at 45 branches. There was particular concern over BCCI's loan portfolio, because of its roots in areas where modern banking was still an alien concept. For instance, a large number of its customers were devout Muslims who believed charging interest on loans a major pillar of modern banking was riba, or usury. In many third-world countries, a person's financial standing did not matter as much as his relationship with his banker. One particularly notable example is the Gokal family, a prominent family of shipping magnates. The three Gokal brothers, Abbas, Mustafa, and Murtaza, were owners of the Gulf Group. They had a relationship with Abedi dating back to his days at United Bank. Abedi personally handled their loans, with little regard for details such as loan documents or creditworthiness. At one point, BCCI's loans to the Gokal companies were equivalent to US$1.2 billion, three times the bank's capital. Longstanding banking practice dictates that a bank not lend more than 10% of its capital to a single customer. Money laundering In addition to violations of lending laws, BCCI was also accused of opening accounts or laundering money for figures such as Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and Samuel Doe, and for criminal organizations such as the Medellin Cartel and Abu Nidal. Police and intelligence experts nicknamed BCCI the \\"Bank of Crooks and Criminals International\\" for its penchant for catering to customers who dealt in arms, drugs, and hot money. William von Raab, a former U.S. Commissioner of Customs, also told the Kerry Committee that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency held \\"several\\" accounts at BCCI. According to a 1991 article in TIME magazine, the National Security Council also had accounts at BCCI, which were used for a variety of covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons during the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Investigations begin BCCI's demise began in 1986, when a U.S. Customs undercover operation led by Special Agent Robert Mazur infiltrated the bank's private client division and uncovered their active role soliciting deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers. This two-year undercover operation concluded in 1988 with a fake wedding that was attended by BCCI officers and drug dealers from around the world, who had established a personal friendship and working relationship with undercover agent Mazur. At the same time he was dealing undercover with BCCI executives, Mazur used his undercover operation to establish a relationship with the hierarchy of the Medellin Cartel as one of their sources for laundering drug proceeds. Mazur's and others' roles in the sting operation were highlighted in the film The Infiltrator (2016). In 1988, the bank was implicated for being the center of a major money laundering scheme. After a six-month trial, BCCI, under immense pressure from U.S. authorities, pleaded guilty in 1990, but only on the grounds of respondeat superior. While federal regulators took no action, Florida regulators forced BCCI to pull out of the state. In 1990, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch presented an impassioned defense of the bank in a speech on the Senate floor. He and his aide, Michael Pillsbury, were involved in efforts to counter the negative publicity that surrounded the bank, and Hatch solicited the bank to approve a $10 million loan to a close friend, Monzer Hourani. The Sandstorm report In March 1991, the Bank of England asked Price Waterhouse to carry out an inquiry. On 24 June 1991, using the code name \\"Sandstorm\\" for BCCI, Price Waterhouse submitted the Sandstorm report showing that BCCI had engaged in \\"widespread fraud and manipulation\\" that made it difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct BCCI's financial history. The Sandstorm report, parts of which were leaked to The Sunday Times, included details of how the Abu Nidal terrorist group had manipulated details and through using fake identities had opened accounts at BCCI's Sloane Street branch in London. Britain's internal security service, MI5, had signed up two sources inside the branch to hand over copies of all documents relating to Abu Nidal's accounts. One source was the Syrian-born branch manager, Ghassan Qassem, the second a young British employee. The Abu Nidal link man for the BCCI accounts was a man based in Iraq named Samir Najmeddin or Najmedeen. Throughout the 1980s, BCCI had set up millions of dollars worth of letters of credit for Najmeddin, largely for arms deals with Iraq. Qassem later swore in an affidavit that Najmeddin was often accompanied by an American, whom Qassem subsequently identified as the financier Marc Rich. Rich was later indicted in the United States for tax evasion and racketeering in an apparently unrelated case and fled the country. Qassem also told reporters that he had once escorted Abu Nidal, who was allegedly using the name Shakir Farhan, around town to buy a tie, without realizing who he was. This revelation led in 1991 to one of the London Evening Standards best-known front-page headlines: \\"I Took Abu Nidal Shopping\\". Forced closure BCCI was awaiting final approval for a restructuring plan in which it would have re-emerged as the \\"Oasis Bank\\". However, after the Sandstorm report, regulators concluded BCCI was so fraught with problems that it had to be seized. It had already been ordered to shut down its American operations in March for its illegal control of First American. On 5 July 1991, regulators persuaded a court in Luxembourg to order BCCI liquidated on the grounds that it was hopelessly insolvent. According to the court order, BCCI had lost more than its entire capital and reserves the year before. At 1 pm London time that day (8 am in New York City), regulators marched into BCCI's offices and shut them down. Around a million depositors were immediately affected by this action. On 7 July 1991, Hong Kong Office of the Commissioner of Banking (forerunner of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) ordered BCCI to shut down its business in Hong Kong on the grounds that BCCI had problem loans and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the major shareholder of BCCI, refused to provide funds to the Hong Kong BCCI. Hong Kong BCCI was liquidated on 17 July 1991. A few weeks after the seizure, on 29 July, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced that a Manhattan grand jury had indicted BCCI, Abedi and Naqvi on twelve counts of fraud, money laundering, and larceny. Morgenthau, who had been investigating BCCI for over two years, claimed jurisdiction because millions of dollars laundered by the bank flowed through Manhattan. Also, Morgenthau cited BCCI's secret ownership of First American, which operated a subsidiary in New York City. Morgenthau said that all of BCCI's deposits had been fraudulently collected because the bank misled depositors about its ownership structure and financial condition. He described BCCI as \\"the largest bank fraud in world financial history\\". On 15 November, BCCI, Abedi and Naqvi were indicted on federal charges that it had illegally bought control of another American bank, Independence Bank of Los Angeles, using Saudi businessman Ghaith Pharaon as the puppet owner. Just a month later, BCCI's liquidators (Deloitte, PWC) pleaded guilty to all criminal charges pending against the bank in the United States (both those lodged by the federal government and by Morgenthau), clearing the way for BCCI's formal liquidation that fall. BCCI paid $10 million in fines and forfeited all $550 million of its American assets at the time, the largest single criminal forfeiture ever obtained by federal prosecutors. The money was used to repay losses to First American and Independence and to make restitution to BCCI's depositors. None of this was enough to rescue both banks, however; Independence was seized later in 1992, while First American was forced into a merger with First Union in 1993. However, many of the major players in the scandal have never been brought to trial in American or UK courts. Abedi, for example, died in 1995. He was under indictment in the United States and UK for crimes related to BCCI, but Pakistani officials refused to give him up for extradition because they felt the charges were politically motivated. Even without this to consider, he'd been in poor health since suffering a stroke in the 1980s. Pharaon remained a fugitive until his death in 2017. In 2002, Denis Robert and Ernest Backes, former number three of financial clearing house Clearstream, discovered that BCCI had continued to maintain its activities after its official closure, with microfiches of Clearstream's illegal unpublished accounts. American inquiries and legal actions In 1991, Robert Mueller declared the government had been investigating BCCI since 1986 resulting in intense media coverage. In 1992, United States Senators John Kerry and Hank Brown became the co-authors of a report on BCCI, which was delivered to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The BCCI scandal was one of a number of disasters that influenced thinking leading to the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA) of 1998. The report found that Clifford and his legal/business partner Robert A. Altman had been closely involved with the bank from 1978, when they were introduced to BCCI by Bert Lance, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget, to 1991. Earlier, Pharaon was revealed to have been the puppet owner of National Bank of Georgia, a bank formerly owned by Lance before being sold back to First American (it had previously been an FGB subsidiary before Lance bought it). Clifford and Altman testified that they had never observed any suspicious activity, and had themselves been deceived about BCCI's control of First American. However, the federal government and Morgenthau contended that the two men knew, or should have known, that BCCI controlled First American. Pharaon also was revealed to be the puppet controlling owner of CenTrust Bank in Miami, Florida. Morgenthau and the federal government brought indictments against Clifford and Altman, but did not pursue Clifford due to his age and deteriorating health (he died in 1998). Altman was indicted and tried in New York, though he was ultimately acquitted following a jury verdict of not guilty. Altman later accepted a de facto lifetime ban from any role in the banking industry to settle a civil suit by the Fed. British inquiry and litigation The British government set up an independent inquiry, chaired by Lord Justice Bingham, in 1992. Its House of Commons Paper, Inquiry into the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was published in October of that year. Following the report, BCCI liquidators Deloitte Touche filed suit against the Bank of England for ¬£850m, claiming that the Bank was guilty of misfeasance in public office. The suit lasted 12 years. It ended in November 2005, when Deloitte withdrew its claims after England's High Court ruled that it was \\"no longer in the best interests of creditors\\" for the litigation to continue. Deloitte eventually paid the Bank of England ¬£73m for its legal costs. According to news reports at the time, it was the most expensive case in British legal history. Litigation elsewhere Although major litigation has ended in the case, suits and legal actions relating to the bank were still being brought in 2013, over 20 years after the bank's failure.

The haloalkanes (also known as halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are a group of chemical compounds derived from alkanes containing one or more halogens. They are a subset of the general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and, consequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula \\"RX\\" where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I). Haloalkanes have been known for centuries. Chloroethane was produced in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century in step with the development of organic chemistry and the understanding of the structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups. While most haloalkanes are human-produced, non-artificial-source haloalkanes do occur on Earth, mostly through enzyme-mediated synthesis by bacteria, fungi, and especially sea macroalgae (seaweeds). More than 1600 halogenated organics have been identified, with bromoalkanes being the most common haloalkanes. Brominated organics in biology range from biologically produced methyl bromide to non-alkane aromatics and unsaturates (indoles, terpenes, acetogenins, and phenols). Halogenated alkanes in land plants are more rare, but do occur, as for example the fluoroacetate produced as a toxin by at least 40 species of known plants. Specific dehalogenase enzymes in bacteria which remove halogens from haloalkanes, are also known. Classes From the structural perspective, haloalkanes can be classified according to the connectivity of the carbon atom to which the halogen is attached. In primary (1¬∞) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group. An example is chloroethane (). In secondary (2¬∞) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom has two C‚ÄìC bonds. In tertiary (3¬∞) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom has three C‚ÄìC bonds. Haloalkanes can also be classified according to the type of halogen on group 7 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. Haloalkanes containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used haloalkanes are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These abbreviations are particularly common in discussions of the environmental impact of haloalkanes. Properties Haloalkanes generally resemble the parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. The melting and boiling points of chloro-, bromo-, and iodoalkanes are higher than the analogous alkanes, scaling with the atomic weight and number of halides. This is due to the increased strength of the intermolecular forces‚Äîfrom London dispersion to dipole-dipole interaction because of the increased polarizability. Thus tetraiodomethane () is a solid whereas tetrachloromethane () is a liquid. Many fluoroalkanes, however, go against this trend and have lower melting and boiling points than their nonfluorinated analogues due to the decreased polarizability of fluorine. For example, methane () has a melting point of -182.5 ¬∞C whereas tetrafluoromethane () has a melting point of -183.6 ¬∞C. As they contain fewer C‚ÄìH bonds, haloalkanes are less flammable than alkanes, and some are used in fire extinguishers. Haloalkanes are better solvents than the corresponding alkanes because of their increased polarity. Haloalkanes containing halogens other than fluorine are more reactive than the parent alkanes‚Äîit is this reactivity that is the basis of most controversies. Many are alkylating agents, with primary haloalkanes and those containing heavier halogens being the most active (fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions). The ozone-depleting abilities of the CFCs arises from the photolability of the C‚ÄìCl bond. Natural occurrence The oceans are estimated to release 1-2 million tons of bromomethane annually. Nomenclature =IUPAC= The formal naming of haloalkanes should follow IUPAC nomenclature, which put the halogen as a prefix to the alkane. For example, ethane with bromine becomes bromoethane, methane with four chlorine groups becomes tetrachloromethane. However, many of these compounds have already an established trivial name, which is endorsed by the IUPAC nomenclature, for example chloroform (trichloromethane) and methylene chloride (dichloromethane). But nowadays, IUPAC nomenclature is used. For unambiguity, this article follows the systematic naming scheme throughout. Production Haloalkanes can be produced from virtually all organic precursors. From the perspective of industry, the most important ones are alkanes and alkenes. =From alkanes= Alkanes react with halogens by free radical halogenation. In this reaction a hydrogen atom is removed from the alkane, then replaced by a halogen atom by reaction with a diatomic halogen molecule. The reactive intermediate in this reaction is a free radical and the reaction is called a radical chain reaction. Free radical halogenation typically produces a mixture of compounds mono- or multihalogenated at various positions. It is possible to predict the results of a halogenation reaction based on bond dissociation energies and the relative stabilities of the radical intermediates. Another factor to consider is the probability of reaction at each carbon atom, from a statistical point of view. Due to the different dipole moments of the product mixture, it may be possible to separate them by distillation. =From alkenes and alkynes= In hydrohalogenation, an alkene reacts with a dry hydrogen halide (HX) like hydrogen chloride () or hydrogen bromide () to form a mono- haloalkane. The double bond of the alkene is replaced by two new bonds, one with the halogen and one with the hydrogen atom of the hydrohalic acid. Markovnikov's rule states that in this reaction, the halogen is more likely to become attached to the more substituted carbon. This is an electrophilic addition reaction. Water must be absent otherwise there will be a side product of a halohydrin. The reaction is necessarily to be carried out in a dry inert solvent such as or directly in the gaseous phase. The reaction of alkynes are similar, with the product being a geminal dihalide; once again, Markovnikov's rule is followed. Alkenes also react with halogens (X2) to form haloalkanes with two neighboring halogen atoms in a halogen addition reaction. Alkynes react similarly, forming the tetrahalo compounds. This is sometimes known as \\"decolorizing\\" the halogen, since the reagent X2 is colored and the product is usually colorless and odorless. =From alcohols= Alcohol undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction by halogen acid to give haloalkanes. Tertiary alkanol reacts with hydrochloric acid directly to produce tertiary choloroalkane (alkyl chloride), but if primary or secondary alcohol is used, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. This reaction is exploited in the Lucas test. The most popular conversion is effected by reacting the alcohol with thionyl chloride () in the \\"Darzens halogenation\\", which is one of the most convenient laboratory methods because the byproducts are gaseous. Both phosphorus pentachloride () and phosphorus trichloride () also convert the hydroxyl group to the chloride. Alcohols may likewise be converted to bromoalkanes using hydrobromic acid or phosphorus tribromide (PBr3). A catalytic amount of may be used for the transformation using phosphorus and bromine; is formed in situ. Iodoalkanes may similarly be prepared using red phosphorus and iodine (equivalent to phosphorus triiodide). The Appel reaction is also useful for preparing alkyl halides. The reagent is tetrahalomethane and triphenylphosphine; the co-products are haloform and triphenylphosphine oxide. =From carboxylic acids= Two methods for the synthesis of haloalkanes from carboxylic acids are the Hunsdiecker reaction and the Kochi reaction. =Biosynthesis= Many chloro and bromoalkanes are formed naturally. The principal pathways involve the enzymes chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase. =By Rydons method= An alcohol on heating with halogen in presence of triphenyl phosphate produces haloalkanes. Reactions Haloalkanes are reactive towards nucleophiles. They are polar molecules: the carbon to which the halogen is attached is slightly electropositive where the halogen is slightly electronegative. This results in an electron deficient (electrophilic) carbon which, inevitably, attracts nucleophiles. =Substitution= Substitution reactions involve the replacement of the halogen with another molecule‚Äîthus leaving saturated hydrocarbons, as well as the halogenated product. Haloalkanes behave as the R+ synthon, and readily react with nucleophiles. Hydrolysis, a reaction in which water breaks a bond, is a good example of the nucleophilic nature of haloalkanes. The polar bond attracts a hydroxide ion, OH‚àí (NaOH(aq) being a common source of this ion). This OH‚àí is a nucleophile with a clearly negative charge, as it has excess electrons it donates them to the carbon, which results in a covalent bond between the two. Thus C‚ÄìX is broken by heterolytic fission resulting in a halide ion, X‚àí. As can be seen, the OH is now attached to the alkyl group, creating an alcohol. (Hydrolysis of bromoethane, for example, yields ethanol). Reaction with ammonia give primary amines. Chloro- and bromoalkanes are readily substituted by iodide in the Finkelstein reaction. The iodoalkanes produced easily undergo further reaction. Sodium iodide is used thus as a catalyst. Haloalkanes react with ionic nucleophiles (e.g. cyanide, thiocyanate, azide); the halogen is replaced by the respective group. This is of great synthetic utility: chloroalkanes are often inexpensively available. For example, after undergoing substitution reactions, cyanoalkanes may be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, or reduced to primary amines using lithium aluminium hydride. Azoalkanes may be reduced to primary amines by the Staudinger reduction or lithium aluminium hydride. Amines may also be prepared from alkyl halides in amine alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis and Delepine reaction, by undergoing nucleophilic substitution with potassium phthalimide or hexamine respectively, followed by hydrolysis. In the presence of a base, haloalkanes alkylate alcohols, amines, and thiols to obtain ethers, N-substituted amines, and thioethers respectively. They are substituted by Grignard reagents to give magnesium salts and an extended alkyl compound. Mechanism Where the rate-determining step of a nucleophilic substitution reaction is unimolecular, it is known as an SN1 reaction. In this case, the slowest (thus rate-determining step) is the heterolysis of a carbon- halogen bond to give a carbocation and the halide anion. The nucleophile (electron donor) attacks the carbocation to give the product. SN1 reactions are associated with the racemization of the compound, as the trigonal planar carbocation may be attacked from either face. They are favored mechanism for tertiary haloalkanes, due to the stabilization of the positive charge on the carbocation by three electron-donating alkyl groups. They are also preferred where the substituents are sterically bulky, hindering the SN2 mechanism. =Elimination= Rather than creating a molecule with the halogen substituted with something else, one can completely eliminate both the halogen and a nearby hydrogen, thus forming an alkene by dehydrohalogenation. For example, with bromoethane and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in ethanol, the hydroxide ion HO‚àí abstracts a hydrogen atom. Bromide ion is then lost, resulting in ethene, H2O and NaBr. Thus, haloalkanes can be converted to alkenes. Similarly, dihaloalkanes can be converted to alkynes. In related reactions, 1,2-dibromocompounds are debrominated by zinc dust to give alkenes and geminal dihalides can react with strong bases to give carbenes. =Other= Haloalkanes undergo free-radical reactions with elemental magnesium to give alkylmagnesium compounds: Grignard reagents. Haloalkanes also react with lithium metal to give organolithium compounds. Both Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds behave as the R‚àí synthon. Alkali metals such as sodium and lithium are able to cause haloalkanes to couple in the Wurtz reaction, giving symmetrical alkanes. Haloalkanes, especially iodoalkanes, also undergo oxidative addition reactions to give organometallic compounds. Applications Teflon structure Chlorinated or fluorinated alkenes undergo polymerization. Important halogenated polymers include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE, or teflon). The production of these materials releases substantial amounts of wastes. ;Alkyl fluorides: An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Most of these compounds are alkyl fluorides.Ann M. Thayer \\"Fabulous Fluorine\\" Chemical and Engineering News, June 5, 2006, Volume 84, pp. 15-24. http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/84/8423cover1.html Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine and fluconazole. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. ;Alkyl chlorides: Some low molecular weight chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethene, and trichloroethane are useful solvents. Several million tons of chlorinated methanes are produced annually. Chloromethane is a precursor to chlorosilanes and silicones. Chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2) is used to make teflon. ;Alkyl bromides: Large scale applications of alkyl bromides exploit their toxicity, which also limits their usefulness. Methyl bromide is also an effective fumigant, but its production and use are controversial. ;Alkyl iodides: No large scale applications are known for alkyl iodides. Methyl iodide is a popular methylating agent in organic synthesis. ;Chlorofluorocarbons: Chlorofluorocarbons were used almost universally as refrigerants and propellants due to their relatively low toxicity and high heat of vaporization. Starting in the 1980s, as their contribution to ozone depletion became known, their use was increasingly restricted, and they have now largely been replaced by HFCs.

In 1923, Banting and John James Rickard Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Banting shared the honours and award money with his colleague, Charles Best. , Banting, who received the Nobel Prize at age 32, remains the youngest Nobel laureate in the area of Physiology/Medicine. That same year, the Government of Canada granted Banting a lifetime annuity to continue his work. In 1934, he was knighted by King George V. Early years View of the Banting farm. Site preserved under the Ontario Heritage Act, with a plaque from the Federal Government recognizing Banting. Frederick Banting was born on November 14, 1891, in a farm house near Alliston, Ontario. The youngest of five children of William Thompson Banting and Margaret Grant, he attended public high school in Alliston. In 1910, he started at Victoria College, part of the University of Toronto, in the General Arts program. After failing his first year, he petitioned to join the medical program in 1912 and was accepted. He began medical school in September 1912. In 1914, he attempted to enter the army on August 16, and then again in October, but was refused due to poor eyesight. Banting successfully joined the army in 1915 and spent the summer training before returning to school. His class was fast-tracked to get more doctors into the war and so he graduated in December 1916 and reported for military duty the next day. He was wounded at the Battle of Cambrai in 1918. Despite his injuries, he helped other wounded men for sixteen hours, until another doctor told him to stop. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1919, for heroism. In 1918, he was awarded the licence to practice medicine, surgery, and midwifery by the Royal College of Physicians of London. Banting returned to Canada after the war and went to Toronto to complete his surgical training. He studied orthopedic medicine and, in 1919‚Äì1920, was Resident Surgeon at The Hospital for Sick Children. Banting was unable to gain a place on the hospital staff and so he decided to move to London, Ontario to set up a medical practice. From July 1920 to May 1921, he continued his general practice, while teaching orthopedics and anthropology part-time at the University of Western Ontario in London because his medical practice had not been particularly successful. From 1921 to 1922 he lectured in pharmacology at the University of Toronto. He received his M.D. degree in 1922, and was also awarded a gold medal.  Medical Research  = Isolation of insulin = Charles H. Best and Banting, c. 1924. An article he read about the pancreas piqued Banting's interest in diabetes. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas to one of his classes at the University of Western Ontario on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written. Research by Naunyn, Minkowski, Opie, Sharpey-Schafer, and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein hormone secreted by the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone \\"insulin\\". The hormone was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract insulin from ground-up pancreas cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the proteolysis enzyme of the pancreas. The challenge was to find a way to extract insulin from the pancreas prior to its destruction. Moses Barron published an article in 1920 which described experimental closure of the pancreatic duct by ligature; this further influenced Banting's thinking. The procedure caused deterioration of the cells of the pancreas that secrete trypsin which breaks down insulin, but it left the islets of Langerhans intact. Banting realized that this procedure would destroy the trypsin-secreting cells but not the insulin. Once the trypsin-secreting cells had died, insulin could be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. Banting discussed this approach with J. J. R. Macleod, Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod provided experimental facilities and the assistance of one of his students, Charles Best. Banting and Best, with the assistance of biochemist James Collip, began the production of insulin by this means. As the experiments proceeded, the required quantities could no longer be obtained by performing surgery on living dogs. In November 1921, Banting hit upon the idea of obtaining insulin from the fetal pancreas. He removed the pancreases from fetal calves at a William Davies slaughterhouse and found the extracts to be just as potent as those extracted from the dog pancreases. By December 1921, he had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult pancreas. Pork and beef would remain the primary commercial sources of insulin until they were replaced by genetically-engineered bacteria in the late 20th century. In spring of 1922, Banting established a private practice in Toronto and began to treat diabetic patients. His first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes Gossett, daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Banting and Macleod were jointly awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Banting split his half of the Prize money with Best, and Macleod split the other half of the Prize money with James Collip. = After insulin = Time cover, 27 Aug 1923 Banting was appointed Senior Demonstrator in Medicine at the University of Toronto in 1922. The following year he was elected to the new Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research, endowed by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. He also served as Honorary Consulting Physician to the Toronto General, the Hospital for Sick Children, and the Toronto Western Hospital. At the Banting and Best Institute, he focused his research on silicosis, cancer, and the mechanisms of drowning. In 1938, Banting's interest in aviation medicine resulted in his participation with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in research concerning the physiological problems encountered by pilots operating high-altitude combat aircraft. Banting headed the RCAF's Number 1 Clinical Investigation Unit (CIU), which was housed in a secret facility on the grounds of the former Eglinton Hunt Club in Toronto.Canadian Space Agency. Canada's Aerospace Medicine Pioneers ‚Äì World War II Jump-Starts Aviation Medicine in Canada. Retrieved January 3, 2012. During the Second World War he investigated the problems of aviators, such as \\"blackout\\" (syncope). He also helped Wilbur Franks with the invention of the G-suit to stop pilots from blacking out when they were subjected to g-forces while turning or diving. Another of Banting's projects during the Second World War involved using and treating mustard gas burns. Banting even tested the gas and antidotes on himself to see if they were effective.  Public statements  = Statements on Hudson's Bay Company = Jackson and Banting on the S. S. Beothic, 1927 During his 1927 Arctic trip with A. Y. Jackson, Banting realised that crew or passengers on board the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) paddle wheeler SS Distributor were responsible for spreading the influenza virus down the Slave River and Mackenzie River, a virus that had over the summer and autumn spread territory-wide, devastating the aboriginal population of the north. Returning from the trip, Banting gave an interview in Montreal with a Toronto Star reporter under the agreement that his statements on HBC would remain off the record. The conversation was nonetheless published in the Toronto Star and rapidly reached a wide audience across Europe and Australia. Banting was angry at the leak, having promised the Department of the Interior not to make any statements to the press prior to clearing them. The article noted that Banting had given the journalist C. R. Greenaway repeated instances of how the fox fur trade always favoured the company: \\"For over $100,000 of fox skins, he estimated that the Eskimos had not received $5,000 worth of goods.\\" He traced this treatment to health, consistent with reports made in previous years by RCMP officers, suggesting that \\"the result was a diet of \\"flour, biscuits, tea and tobacco,\\" with the skins that once were used for clothing traded merely for \\"cheap whiteman's goods.\\"\\" The fur trade commissioner for the Hudson's Bay Company called Banting's remarks \\"false and slanderous\\", and a month later, the governor and general manager of HBC met Banting at The Omni King Edward Hotel to demand a retraction. Banting stated that the reporter had betrayed his confidence, but did not retract his statement and reaffirmed that HBC was responsible for the death of indigenous residents by supplying the wrong kind of food and introducing diseases into the Arctic. As A. Y. Jackson notes in his memoir, since neither the governor nor the general manager had been to the Arctic, the meeting ended with them asking Banting's advice on what HBC ought to do: \\"He gave them some good advice and later he received a card at Christmas with the Governor's best wishes.\\" Banting also maintained this position in his report to the Department of the Interior: > He noted that ‚Äúinfant mortality was high because of the undernourishment of > the mother before birth‚Äù; that ‚Äúwhite man‚Äôs food leads to decay of native > teeth‚Äù; that ‚Äútuberculosis has commenced.

H. Stringer. Personal life Banting and Marion Robertson on their wedding day Banting married twice. His first marriage was to Marion Robertson in 1924; they had one child, William (1929-1998). They divorced in 1932 and Banting married Henrietta Ball in 1937. In February 1941, Banting died of wounds and exposure following the crash of a Lockheed L-14 Super Electra/Hudson in which he was a passenger, in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland. After departing from Gander, Newfoundland, both of the plane's engines failed. The navigator and co-pilot died instantly, but Banting and the pilot, Captain Joseph Mackey, survived the initial impact. According to Mackey, the sole survivor, Banting died from his injuries the next day. Banting was en route to England to conduct operational tests on the Franks flying suit developed by his colleague Wilbur Franks.National Defence Canada, Canadian Forces Health Services.

Banting and his wife are buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. = Painting = Banting developed an interest in painting beginning around 1921 while he was in London, Ontario. Some of his first pieces were done on the back of the cardboard in which his shirts were packed by the dry-cleaners. He became friends with The Group of Seven artists A. Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris, sharing their love of the rugged Canadian landscape. Writing on Banting, Jackson recalls that \\"He did not want to make a business of art and would tell [would-be purchasers] to go buy a Lismer or something else and then he would exchange it for one of his.\\" In 1927, he made a sketching trip with Jackson to the St. Lawrence River in Quebec. Later that year, they traveled to RCMP outposts in the Arctic on the Canadian Government supply ship Beothic. The sketches, done both in oils on birch panels and in pen and ink, were named after the places he visited: Craig Harbour, Ellesmere Island; Pond Inlet, Baylot Island; Eskimo tents at Etach; others were untitled. Jackson and Banting also made painting expeditions to Great Slave Lake, Walsh Lake (Northwest Territories), Georgian Bay, French River and the Sudbury District. At the time of his death in 1941, Banting was one of Canada's best-known amateur painters. Dennis Reid, the former director of Collections and Research at the Art Gallery of Ontario, views Banting's works as very much \\"part of the Jackson story.\\" Legacy In 1994, Banting was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was nominated as one of the top 10 \\"Greatest Canadians\\" by viewers of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. When the final votes were counted, Banting finished fourth behind Tommy Douglas, Terry Fox and Pierre Trudeau. = Namesakes = National Portrait Gallery of Canada Banting's namesake, the Banting Research Foundation, was created in 1925 and provides funding to support health and biomedical research in Canada.

The Banting Interpretation Centre in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador is a museum named after him which focuses on the circumstances surrounding the 1941 plane crash which claimed his life. The crater Banting on the Moon is also named after him for his contributions to medicine. During the voting for \\"Greatest Canadians\\" in late 2003, controversy rose over the future use of the Banting family farm in New Tecumseth which had been left to the Ontario Historical Society by Banting's late nephew, Edward, in 1998. The dispute centred on the future use of the 40 ha (100 acre) property and its buildings. In a year-long negotiation, assisted by a provincially appointed facilitator, the Town of New Tecumseth offered $1 million to the Ontario Historical Society (OHS). The town intended to turn the property over to the Sir Frederick Banting Legacy Foundation for preservation of the property and buildings, and the Legacy Foundation planned to erect a Camp for Diabetic Youths. The day after the November 22, 2006, deadline for the OHS to sign the agreement, the OHS announced that it had sold the property for housing development to Solmar Development for more than $2 million. The Town of New Tecumseth announced it would designate the property under the Ontario Heritage Act. This would prevent its commercial development and obligate the owner to maintain it properly. OHS objected. The Ontario Conservation Review Board heard arguments for and against designation in September 2007 and recommended designation of the entire property in October. The Town officially passed the designation by- law on November 12, 2007.

Biography Born in West Pembroke, Maine on February 27, 1899 to Luella Fisher and Herbert Huestis Best, Canadian born physician from Nova Scotia. Best grew up in Pembroke before going to Toronto to study medicine in 1915. Best married Margaret Hooper Mahon in Toronto in 1924 and they had two sons. One son, Henry Best was a well-regarded historian who later became president of Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. Best's other son was Charles Alexander Best, a Canadian politician and geneticist. His father, Herbert Best, was a doctor in a New England Town within Maine with limited economic capabilities, limited to mostly sardine-packing. His mother, Lulu Newcomb, later Lulu Best, did not work, however was prone to sing and play instruments. By the time Charles had reached age, he was choosing between the likes of McGill University and the University of Toronto, family connections persuaded him to pursue his studies in Toronto. Family illness had guided Dr. Best's research interests, having his Aunt Anna die from diabetes, which had profound effects upon him. It was for this reason, alongside his father being a physician, that he chose to study at University of Toronto and train to become a doctor. His University studies were interrupted following his first year at University of Toronto in the faculty of Physiology and Biochemistry, by the onset of the First World War. Here he served as an infantry soldier, however reached the level of acting Sergeant Major. Following his service, he eventually returned to Toronto, but was falling behind in his classes. However, as he claims, the greatest moment of his life occurred following the return to University, when he met his later wife, Margaret Mahon (1900-1988). He died on March 31, 1978 in Toronto, Ontario. Best is interred in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto (section 29) not far from Sir Frederick Banting. Co-discovery of insulin Charles H. Best and Frederick Banting, ca. 1924. The Discovery and Early Development of Insulin Digital Collection, Toronto Best moved in 1915 to Toronto, Ontario, where he started studying towards a bachelor of arts degree at University College, University of Toronto. In 1918, he enlisted in the Canadian Army serving with the 2nd Canadian Tank Battalion. After the war, he completed his degree in physiology and biochemistry. As a 22-year-old medical student at the University of Toronto he worked as an assistant to the surgeon Dr. Frederick Banting and contributed to the discovery of the pancreatic hormone insulin, which led to an effective treatment for diabetes. In the spring of 1921, Banting travelled to Toronto to visit J.J.R. Macleod, professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his laboratory to isolate pancreatic extracts from dogs. Macleod was initially sceptical, but eventually agreed before leaving on holiday for the summer. Before leaving for Scotland he supplied Banting with ten dogs for experiment and two medical students, Charles Best and Clark Noble, as lab assistants. Since Banting required only one assistant, Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting first. Best won and took the first shift. Loss of the coin toss proved unfortunate for Noble, given that Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half of his Nobel Prize money and a part of the credit for the discovery of insulin. Had Noble won the toss, his career might have taken a different path. MacLeod was overseeing the work of Banting, who had no experience of physiology, and his assistant Best. In December, when Banting and Best were having difficulties in refining the pancreatic extract and monitoring glucose levels, MacLeod assigned the biochemist James Collip to the team. In January 1922, while Collip was working on insulin purification, Best and Banting administered prematurely their pancreatic extracts to 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, who suffered a severe allergic reaction. Eventually, Collip succeeded in preparing insulin in a more pure, usable form. Banting, Best and Collip shared the patent for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar. In 1923, the Nobel Prize Committee honoured Banting and J. J. R. Macleod with the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of insulin, ignoring Best and Collip. Banting chose to share half of the prize money with Best. The key contribution by Collip was recognised in the Nobel speech of McLeod, who also gave one-half of his prize money to Collip. Professor of physiology Best succeeded Macleod as professor of physiology at University of Toronto in 1929. During World War II he was influential in establishing a Canadian program for securing and using dried human blood serum. In his later years, he was an adviser to the Medical Research Committee of the United Nations World Health Organization. Awards and honours Mt. Pleasant Cemetery Best was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in recognition for \\"his contribution to medicine, particularly as co-discoverer of insulin.\\" He was a commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire and was made a member of Order of the Companions of Honour in 1971 \\"for services to Medical Research\\". He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada, and was the first Canadian to be elected into the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. As a recipient of the Order of Canada, he was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1994 he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

Army Air Service, 1919‚Äì1924 Curtiss PW-8 In September 1919, the Army Air Service decided that it needed an organized designation sequence, and adopted fifteen classifications, designated by Roman numerals. Several other unnumbered designations were added later. Each designation was assigned an abbreviation, and each design a number within that abbreviation. Variants were designated by alphabetically appending letters to the design number. =Type O: Foreign- Built Pursuit Aircraft= * Fokker D.VII ‚Äì Fokker * Fokker D.VIII ‚Äì Fokker =Type I: Pursuit, water-cooled= * PW-1 ‚Äì Engineering Division * PW-2 ‚Äì Loening * PW-3 ‚Äì Orenco * PW-4 ‚Äì Gallaudet * PW-5 ‚Äì Fokker * PW-6 ‚Äì Fokker * PW-7 ‚Äì Fokker * PW-8 ‚Äì Curtiss * PW-9 ‚Äì Boeing =Type II: Pursuit, night= * PN-1 ‚Äì Curtiss =Type III: Pursuit, air-cooled= * PA-1 ‚Äì Loening =Type IV: Pursuit, ground attack, 1922= * PG-1 ‚Äì Aeromarine =Type V: Two-seat pursuit= * TP-1 ‚Äì Engineering Division =Type VI: Ground attack, 1920‚Äì1922= * GA-1 ‚Äì Boeing * GA-2 ‚Äì Boeing =Type VII: Infantry liaison= * IL-1 ‚Äì Orenco =Type VIII: Night observation= * NO-1 ‚Äì Douglas * NO-2 ‚Äì Douglas =Type IX: Artillery observation= * AO-1 ‚Äì Atlantic =Type X: Corps observation= * CO-1 ‚Äì Engineering Division * CO-2 ‚Äì Engineering Division * CO-3 ‚Äì Engineering Division * CO-4 ‚Äì Atlantic * CO-5 ‚Äì Engineering Division * CO-6 ‚Äì Engineering Division * CO-7 ‚Äì Boeing * CO-8 ‚Äì Atlantic =Type XI: Day bombardment= * DB-1 ‚Äì Gallaudet =Type XII: Night bombardment, short range= * NBS-1 ‚Äì Martin (originally designated MB-2) * NBS-2 ‚Äì Lowe-Willard-Fowler * NBS-3 ‚Äì Elias * NBS-4 ‚Äì Curtiss =Type XIII: Night bombardment, long range= * NBL-1 ‚Äì Witteman-Lewis * NBL-2 ‚Äì Martin =Type XIV: Trainer, air-cooled= * TA-1 ‚Äì Elias * TA-2 ‚Äì Huff-Daland * TA-3 ‚Äì Dayton-Wright Aircraft * TA-4 ‚Äì Engineering Division * TA-5 ‚Äì Dayton-Wright Aircraft * TA-6 ‚Äì Huff-Daland =Type XV: Trainer, water-cooled= * TW-1 ‚Äì Engineering Division * TW-2 ‚Äì Cox-Klemin * TW-3 ‚Äì Dayton-Wright Aircraft * TW-4 ‚Äì Fokker * TW-5 ‚Äì Huff-Daland =Ambulance, 1919‚Äì1924= * A-1 ‚Äì Cox- Klemin * A-2 ‚Äì Fokker =Messenger= * M-1 ‚Äì Engineering Division/Sperry =Pursuit, special= * PS-1 ‚Äì Dayton-Wright =Racer= Verville-Sperry R-3 * R-1 ‚Äì Alfred V.

Aircraft were divided into three different types ‚Äì 'A' for fixed-wing aircraft, 'H' for helicopters, or 'V' for V/STOL aircraft, and then were given a mission modifier, which, unlike the USAF system, came after the type code: 'C' for transports, 'O' for observation and reconnaissance aircraft, 'U' for utility types, and 'Z' for experimental aircraft. Aircraft types designated in this system were numbered sequentially.Chorney, Andrew. Systems of Designation, U.S. Army Aircraft, 1956‚Äì1962 System.

Pre-war Soviet System The Soviet system used from shortly after the revolution in 1923 and until gradually superseded after 1940, was divided by function, with numbers assigned in order by the government. Duplicate designations were common, as were multiple meanings for individual letters. Designers and manufacturers also had their own internal designations which could be confused for the official government designations. For instance, Tupolev's designs used the designator ANT, for A.N.Tupolev and Yakovlev's designs used AIR, for A.I.Rykov, the communist leader he reported to. Not all designations were taken up, some numbers were assigned to projects that were subsequently cancelled, often at a very early stage of development. =Type prefixes= (Cyrillic characters in parenthesis) *A (–ê) - Avtozhir (autogiro) A-4 - TsAGIhttp://ram-home.com/ram-old/a-4.html A-7 - Kamovhttp://ram- home.com/ram-old/a-7kamov.html *ARK (A–†–ö) - ARKtichyeskii (arctic = arctic exploration aircraft) ARK-3 - Chyetverikov ARK-5 - Polikarpov R-5 *B (–ë) - Bombardirovshchik (bomber) (Generic designation - not used for specific types) *BI (–ë–ò) - Blitzniy Istrebitel (short/close-range fighter) BI-1 - Bereznyak- Isayev *BB (–ë–ë) - Blizhniy Bombardirovshchik (short-range bomber) BB-1 - Sukhoi Su-2 BB-2 - Grushin BB-22 - Yakovlev Yak-2 BB-22bis - Yakovlev Yak-4 *BSh (–ë–®) - Bronirovannyi Shturmovik (Armored Ground Attack aircraft) BSh-1 - Vultee V-11 BSh-2 - Ilyushin Il-2 *DI (–î–ò) - Dvukhmestnyi Istrebitel (two-seat fighter) DI-1: Polikarpov DI-2: Polikarpov DI-3: Grigorovich DI-4: Laville DI-6: Kochyerigin/TsKB-11 DI-8: Tupolev ANT-46/Tupolev SB *DIP (–î–ò–ü) - Dvukhmotorny Istrebitel Pushechny (twin engine cannon fighter) DIP: Tupolev ANT-29 *DB (–î–ë) - Dalniy Bombardirovshchik (long-range bomber) DB-1: Tupolev ANT-25 DB-2: Tupolev ANT-37 DB-3: Ilyushin TsKB-30, redesignated Il-4 DB-4: Ilyushin TsKB-56 (prototype only) DB-240: Yermolayev, redesignated Yer-2 DB-A - Bolkhovitinov *FB (–§–ë) - Frontovoy Bombardirovshchik (front-line bomber) FB: Tupolev Tu-2 *G (–ì) - Gruzovoi (cargo, usually converted heavy bomber) G-1: Tupolev TB-1 as transport G-2: Tupolev TB-3 as transport *GST (–ì–°–¢) - Gydro Samolyot Transportnyj (cargo hydroplane) GST - Consolidated PBY Catalinahttp://ram- home.com/ram-old/gst.html *I (–ò) - Istrebitel (destroyer = fighter) I-Z - Grigorovich I-1 - Polikarpov I-1 - Grigorovich (duplicated designation) I-2 - Grigorovich I-3 - Polikarpov I-4 - Tupolev ANT-5 I-5 - Polikarpov.

However, this latter rule was not always applied, especially for helicopters. Contrary to western sources, official Soviet designations did not include constructors' names (e.g. Yakovlev Yak-1), only abbreviations (i.e. Yak-1) however initially full names like Yakovlev-1 were occasionally used. Numerical designations were assigned individually for each developer to aircraft when they entered service. Aircraft also frequently had development designations used within design bureaus, like aircraft 105, or ANT-105 that led to the Tu-22, or T-6 for Su-24, and an industry production name assigned to the facility where production was undertaken. The NATO Air Standardization Coordinating Committee reporting name system (used because designations of new types were often unknown to NATO) was based on an initial letter indicating type of aircraft (B = bomber, C = cargo, F = fighter, H = helicopter, M = miscellaneous) or missile, and 1 syllable if propeller-driven or 2 if jet- or rocket-powered.

Berenice was a member of the Herodian Dynasty that ruled the Roman province of Judaea between 39 BCE and 92 CE. She was the daughter of King Herod Agrippa I and a sister of King Herod Agrippa II. What little is known about her life and background comes mostly from the early historian Flavius Josephus, who detailed a history of the Jewish people and wrote an account of the Jewish Rebellion of 67. Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Aurelius Victor and Juvenal, also tell about her. She is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (25:13, 23; 26:30). However, it is for her tumultuous love life that she is primarily known from the Renaissance. Her reputation was based on the bias of the Romans to the Eastern princesses, like Cleopatra or later Zenobia. After a number of failed marriages throughout the 40s, she spent much of the remainder of her life at the court of her brother Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus. However, her unpopularity among the Romans compelled Titus to dismiss her on his accession as emperor in 79. When he died two years later, she disappeared from the historical record.  Early life  Berenice was born in 28Josephus writes that Berenice was sixteen at the time of her father's death, which fixes her birthdate on the year 28. See Josephus, Ant. XIX.9.1 to Herod Agrippa and Cypros, as granddaughter to Aristobulus IV and great-granddaughter to Herod the Great. Her elder brother was Agrippa II (b. 27), and her younger sisters were Mariamne (b. 34) and Drusilla (b. 38).Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.5.4Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.9.1 According to Josephus, there was also a younger brother called Drusus, who died before his teens. Her family constituted part of what is known as the Herodian Dynasty, who ruled the Judaea Province between 39 BCE and 92 CE. Berenice depicted with her brother Agrippa II during the trial of St. Paul. From a stained glass window in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Josephus records three short-lived marriages in Berenice's life, the first which took place sometime between 41 and 43, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.5.1 On his early death in 44, she was married to her father's brother, Herod of Chalcis, with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.5.2 After her husband died in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.7.3 According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers.Juvenal, Satires VI Whether this was based on truth remains unknown. Berenice indeed spent much of her life at the court of Agrippa, and by all accounts shared almost equal power. Popular rumors may also have been fueled by the fact that Agrippa himself never married during his lifetime. Like her brother, Berenice was a client ruler of the parts of the Roman Empire that lie in the present-day Israel. The Acts of the Apostles records that during this time, Paul the Apostle appeared before their court at Caesarea.King James Bible, Acts 25, 26  Jewish-Roman wars  = First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War = Map of 1st century Judaea. In 64 emperor Nero appointed Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically discriminated against in favour of the Greek population of the region.Josephus, The War of the Jews II.14 Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem under the guise of imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. Appalled at the treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews. Not only did he refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice herself was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city.Josephus, The War of the Jews II.15.1 Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.Josephus, The War of the Jews II.16.1 To prevent Jewish violence from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful speech to the crowd in the company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces.Josephus, The War of the Jews II.17.6 They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the Twelfth legion, but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.Josephus, The War of the Jews II.19.9 Emperor Nero then appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion; he landed in Judaea with Fifth and Tenth legions in 67.Josephus, The War of the Jews III.1.2 He was later joined at Ptolemais by his son Titus, who brought with him the Fifteenth legion.Josephus, The War of the Jews III.4.2 With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem. = Affair with Titus = It was during this time that Berenice met and fell in love with Titus, who was eleven years her junior.Tacitus, Histories II.2 The Herodians sided with the Flavians during the conflict, and later in 69, the Year of the Four Emperors when the Roman Empire saw the quick succession of the emperors Galba, Otho and VitelliusBerenice reportedly used all her wealth and influence to support Vespasian on his campaign to become emperor.Tacitus, Histories II.81 When Vespasian was declared emperor on 21 December 69, Titus was left in Judaea to finish putting down the rebellion. The war ended in 70 with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sack of Jerusalem, with approximately 1 million dead, and 97,000 taken captive by the Romans.Josephus, The War of the Jews VI.6.1, VI.9.3 Triumphant, Titus returned to Rome to assist his father in the government, while Berenice stayed behind in Judaea. Josephus is discussing the aftermath of the first phase of the Jewish Roman Wars, Berenice had been tied to key territory in that rebellion and Rome operated a system of hostages generally. There has been acceptance that Berenice was in a love affair with a Roman Emperor subduing a rebellion she was clearly at the heart of and a hostage situation and a love affair are not the same. It took four years until they reunited, when she and Agrippa came to Rome in 75. The reasons for this long absence are unclear, but have been linked to possible opposition to her presence by Gaius Licinius Mucianus, a political ally of emperor Vespasian who died sometime between 72 and 78. Agrippa was given the rank of praetor, while Berenice resumed her relationship with Titus, living with him at the palace and reportedly acting in every respect as his wife.Cassius Dio, Roman History LXV.15 The ancient historian Cassius Dio writes that Berenice was at the height of her power during this time, and if it can be any indication as to how influential she was, Quintilian records an anecdote in his Institutio Oratoria where, to his astonishment, he found himself pleading a case on Berenice's behalf where she herself presided as the judge.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria IV.1 The Roman populace however perceived the Eastern Queen as an intrusive outsider, and when the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away. Upon the accession of Titus as emperor in 79, she returned to Rome, but was quickly dismissed amidst a number of popular measures of Titus to restore his reputation with the populace.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Titus 7 It is possible that he intended to send for her at a more convenient time. However, after reigning barely two years as emperor, he suddenly died on 13 September 81.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Titus 10, 11 It is not known what happened to Berenice after her final dismissal from Rome. Her brother Agrippa died around 92, and with him the Herodian Dynasty came to an end. In modern history, her aspirations as a potential empress of Rome have led to her being described as a 'miniature Cleopatra'.  Berenice in the arts  From the 17th century to contemporary times, there has been a long tradition of works of art (novels, dramas, operas, etc.) devoted to or featuring Berenice and especially her affair with the Roman Emperor Titus.Gabriele Boccaccini, Portraits of Middle Judaism in Scholarship and Arts (Turin: Zamorani, 1992); S.

July 310), also known as Maximian Herculius,DiMaio \\"Maximianus Herculius\\" was Roman emperor from 286 to 305. He was Caesar from 285 to 286, then Augustus from 286 to 305. He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, Diocletian, whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In late 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. From 285 to 288, he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into Alamannic territory in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion. The man he appointed to police the Channel shores, Carausius, rebelled in 286, causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius, and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximian's subordinate, Constantius, campaigned against Carausius' successor, Allectus, while Maximian held the Rhine frontier. The rebel leader was ousted in 296, and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near Hispania and Berber incursions in Mauretania. When these campaigns concluded in 298, he departed for Italy, where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletian's behest, Maximian abdicated on 1 May 305, gave the Augustan office to Constantius, and retired to southern Italy. In late 306, Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son Maxentius' rebellion in Italy. In April 307, he attempted to depose his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantius' successor, Constantine (Maximian's step-grandson and son-in-law), in Trier. At the Council of Carnuntum in November 308, Diocletian and his successor, Galerius, forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310, Maximian attempted to seize Constantine's title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him, and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian killed himself in mid-310 on Constantine's orders. During Constantine's war with Maxentius, Maximian's image was purged from all public places. However, after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius, Maximian's image was rehabilitated, and he was deified. Early life Antoninianus of Maximian. Legend: IMPerator MAXIMIANVS AVGustus. An Argenteus of Maximian. Legend: MAXIMIANVS AVGustus. Maximian was born near Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) in the province of Pannonia, around 250 into a family of shopkeepers.Epitome de Caesaribus 40.10, quoted in Barnes, New Empire, 32; Barnes, New Empire, 32; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 30; Williams, 43‚Äì44. Beyond that, the ancient sources contain vague allusions to Illyricum as his homeland,Victor, Liber de Caesaribus 39.26, quoted in Barnes, New Empire, 32. to his Pannonian virtues,Panegrici Latini 10(2).2.2ff, quoted in Barnes, New Empire, 32. and to his harsh upbringing along the war-torn Danube frontier.Panegrici Latini 10(2).2.4, quoted in Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 44‚Äì45. Maximian joined the army, serving with Diocletian under the emperors Aurelian (r. 270‚Äì275) and Probus (r. 276‚Äì282). He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of Carus in 283 and attended Diocletian's election as emperor on November 20, 284 at Nicomedia.Barnes, New Empire, 32‚Äì33; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 30. Maximian's swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian Timothy Barnes to mean that the two men were longterm allies, that their respective roles were pre-agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against Carinus (r. 283‚Äì285) but there is no direct evidence for this.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Williams, 43‚Äì44. With his great energy, firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel, Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourth-century historian Aurelius Victor described Maximian as \\"a colleague trustworthy in friendship, if somewhat boorish, and of great military talents\\".Victor, Liber de Caesaribus 39, quoted in Williams, 44. Despite his other qualities, Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The panegyric of 289, after comparing his actions to Scipio Africanus' victories over Hannibal during the Second Punic War, suggested that Maximian had never heard of them.Panegyrici Latini 10(2), quoted in Williams, 44. His ambitions were purely military; he left politics to Diocletian.Williams, 44. The Christian rhetor Lactantius suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian's basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes, and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 13. Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators' daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust, though Lactantius' credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans.Lactantius, De mortibus persecutorum 8, quoted in Williams, 44. Maximian had two children with his Syrian wife, Eutropia: Maxentius and Fausta. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius' birth year have varied from c. 276 to 283Tyranny and Transformation: \\" Born sometime between a.d. 276 and 283, Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maxentius was the son of the tetrarchic emperor Maximian and Eutropia.\\"., and most date Fausta's birth to c. 289 or 290.Barnes, New Empire, 34. Barnes dates Maxentius' birth to circa 283, when Maximian was in Syria, and Fausta's birth to 289 or 290 (Barnes, New Empire, 34). Theodora, the wife of Constantius Chlorus, is often called Maximian's stepdaughter by ancient sources, leading to claims by Otto Seeck and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus.Aurelius Victor, de Caesaribus 39.25; Eutropius, Breviaria 9.22; Jerome, Chronicle 225g; Epitome de Caesaribus 39.2, 40.12, quoted in Barnes, New Empire, 33; Barnes, New Empire, 33. Barnes challenges this view, saying that all \\"stepdaughter\\" sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history Kaisergeschichte, while other, more reliable, sources refer to her as Maximian's natural daughter.Origo Constantini 2; Philostorgius, Historia Ecclesiastica 2.16a, quoted in Barnes, New Empire, 33. See also Panegyrici Latini 10(2)11.4. Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c. 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus' daughters.Barnes, New Empire, 33‚Äì34. Appointment as Caesar Golden solidus of Maximian. Legend: MAXIMIANVS AVGVSTVS / CONSVL IIII Pater Patriae PROCOnSul ‚Äì SMAZ (Aquileia mint). Diocletian, Maximian's senior colleague and Augustus in the east. Legend: IMP. CARAVSIVS P. F. AVG. / LEGion IIII FL ‚Äì ML (Londinium mint) At Mediolanum (Milan, Italy) in July 285,The event has been dated to both July 21 (Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Barnes, New Empire, 4; Bowman, 69) and July 25 (Potter, 280‚Äì81). Diocletian proclaimed Maximian as his co-ruler, or Caesar.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Barnes, New Empire, 4; Bowman, 69; Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40; Potter, 280‚Äì81. The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the Empire, from Gaul to Syria, from Egypt to the lower Danube, Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 30; Southern, 136. Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.Williams, 45. Next, Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons, just a daughter, Valeria, who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a co-ruler from outside his family and that co-ruler had to be someone he trusted.Potter, 280; Southern, 136; Williams, 43. (The historian William Seston has argued that Diocletian, like heirless emperors before him, adopted Maximian as his filius Augusti (\\"Augustan son\\") upon his appointment to the office. Some agree, but the historian Frank Kolb has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence.Bowman, 69; Odahl, 42‚Äì43; Southern, 136, 331; Williams, 45. Maximian did take Diocletian's nomen (family name) Valerius, however.Bowman, 69.) Finally, Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess, both sole-emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power.Potter, 280. In contrast, just a few years earlier, the emperor Carus and his sons had ruled jointly, albeit not for long. Even the first emperor, Augustus, (r. 27 BC‚ÄìAD 14), had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co-emperor had existed from Marcus Aurelius (r. 161‚Äì180) on.Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40. The dual system evidently worked well. About 287, the two rulers' relationship was re-defined in religious terms, with Diocletian assuming the title Iovius and Maximian Herculius.Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40; Liebeschuetz, Continuity and Change, 235‚Äì52, 240‚Äì43; Odahl, 43‚Äì44; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 32‚Äì33. The titles were pregnant with symbolism: Diocletian-Jove had the dominant role of planning and commanding; Maximian-Hercules the heroic role of completing assigned tasks.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 11‚Äì12; Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40; Odahl, 43; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 32‚Äì33, 39, 42‚Äì52; Southern, 136‚Äì37; Williams, 58‚Äì59. Yet despite the symbolism, the emperors were not \\"gods\\" in the Imperial cult (although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics). Instead, they were the gods' instruments, imposing the gods' will on earth.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 11. Once the rituals were over, Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Southern, 137; Williams, 45‚Äì46. Early campaigns in Gaul and Germany The Bagaudae of Gaul are obscure figures, appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources, with their 285 uprising being their first appearance.Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 29. The fourth-century historian Eutropius described them as rural people under the leadership of Amandus and Aelianus, while Aurelius Victor called them bandits.Eutropius, Brev. 9.20; Aurelius Victor, de Caesaribus, 39.17, quoted in Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 29‚Äì30. The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants, seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus (a native of Gallia Narbonensis, in what would become southern France): in this case, they would be defecting imperial troops, not brigands.Potter, 281‚Äì82. Although poorly equipped, led and trained ‚Äì and therefore a poor match for Roman legions ‚Äì Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Barnes, New Empire, 10; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 30; Southern, 137; Williams, 45‚Äì46. Maximian has been implicated in a massacre of Coptic Christian troops from the headquarters unit of a legion raised in Thebes at Aucanus in modern Switzerland in early 285, during the preparations for the campaign against the Bagaudae.O'Reilly, Lost Legion Rediscovered: The Mystery of the Theban Legion, 117-122. Maximian traveled to Gaul, engaging the Bagaudae late in mid-285.Barnes, New Empire, 57; Bowman, 70‚Äì71. Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail: the historical sources dwell only on Maximian's virtues and victories. The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency.Southern, 137. As the campaign was against the Empire's own citizens, and therefore distasteful, it went unrecorded in titles and official triumphs. Indeed, Maximian's panegyrist declares: \\"I pass quickly over this episode, for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it.\\"Panegyrici Latini 10(2), quoted in Williams, 46; Southern, 137. By the end of the year, the revolt had significantly abated, and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier, heralding a period of stability.Southern, 139‚Äì138; Williams, 46. Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In late 285, two barbarian armies ‚Äì one of Burgundians and Alamanni, the other of Chaibones and Heruli ‚Äì forded the Rhine and entered Gaul.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Barnes, New Empire, 57; Bowman, 71; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 31. The first army was left to die of disease and hunger, while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6. He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns,Williams, 46. either at Moguntiacum (Mainz, Germany), Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany), or Colonia Agrippina (Cologne, Germany).Potter, 282‚Äì83. Potter and Barnes (New Empire, 56) favor Trier; Williams (Diocletian, 46) favors Mainz. Carausius antefix roof tile showing the badge and standard of Legio XX Valeria Victrix, one of the legions that joined Carausius' rebellion Although most of Gaul was pacified, regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from Frankish and Saxon piracy. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the Saxon Shore, but much remained to be done.Southern, 138; Williams, 46. For example, there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at Dover and Boulogne during 270‚Äì285.Potter, 284. In response to the pirate problem, Maximian appointed Mausaeus Carausius, a Menapian from Germania Inferior (southern and western Netherlands) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6; Barnes, New Empire, 57. Carausius fared well,Bowman, 71; Southern, 138; Williams, 46‚Äì47. and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.Southern, 138; Williams, 46‚Äì47. Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 6‚Äì7; Bowman, 71; Potter, 283‚Äì84; Southern, 137‚Äì41; Williams, 47. Maximian ordered Carausius' arrest and execution, prompting him to flee to Britain. Carausius' support among the British was strong, and at least two British legions (II Augusta and XX Valeria Victrix) defected to him, as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne (probably XXX Ulpia Victrix).Potter, 284; Southern, 139‚Äì40; Williams, 47. Most of the information for the legions under Carausius' control comes from his coinage. Strangely, Legio VI Victrix from Eboracum (York, United Kingdom), which, for geographical regions, should have been included in the legions Carausius had control over, generally is not (Southern, 332). The Panegyrici Latini 8(4)12.1 admits one continental legion joined him, probably the XXX Ulpia Victrix (Potter, 650). Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.Williams, 47. Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet ‚Äì he had given it to Carausius ‚Äì and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks. Meanwhile, Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet, enlisting Frankish mercenaries, and paying his troops well. By late 286, Britain, much of northwestern Gaul, and the entire Channel coast, was under his control.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Bowman, 71; Southern, 140. Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state, an Imperium Britanniarum and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian, earning the support of British and Gallic merchants.Williams, 47‚Äì48. Even Maximian's troops were vulnerable to Carausius' influence and wealth.Potter, 284; Williams, 61‚Äì62. Maximian appointed Augustus Spurred by the crisis with Carausius, on April 1, 286, Maximian took the title of Augustus.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Bleckmann; Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40; Potter, 282; Southern, 141‚Äì42; Williams, 48. This gave him the same status as Carausius ‚Äì so the clash was between two Augusti, rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar ‚Äì and, in Imperial propaganda, Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian's brother, his equal in authority and prestige.Williams, 48. Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian's appointment,Potter, 282, 649. Diocletian would have been somewhere between Byzantium (Istanbul, Turkey), where he is attested for March 22, 286 and Tiberias, where he is attested from May 31, 286 through August 31 (Barnes, New Empire, 50‚Äì51; Potter, 282, 649). causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support, and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it.Potter, 282, 649. Despite the physical distance between the emperors, Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers, and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.Potter, 282; Williams, 49. In theory, the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium. Though divisions did take place ‚Äì each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences ‚Äì these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a patrimonium indivisum.Bowman, 70; Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65. As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: \\"So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two Heracleidae, the Spartan Kings, had done.\\"Panegyrici Latini 10(2)9.4, quoted in Potter, 283. Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors' names, and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire.Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65. Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian's province of Africa; Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletian's territory.Potter, 283. Campaigns against Rhenish tribes =Campaigns in 286 and 287= Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Bowman, 71; Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40. These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius.Southern, 141; Williams, 50. Although Maximian had many enemies along the river, they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire.Williams, 50. Few clear dates survive for Maximian's campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288.Southern, 142. Barnes' New Empire records five dates for the period: the first, February 10, 286 at Milan (Codex Justinianus 8.53(54).6; Fragmenta Vaticana 282); June 21, 286 at Mainz (Fragmenta Vaticana 271); January 1, 287 Trier or Cologne or Mainz (date of consular assumption, Panegyrici Latini 10(2).6.2 ff.); and 287, his \\"expedition across the Rhine\\" (Panegyrici Latini 10(2).7.1ff.) (Barnes, New Empire, 57). While receiving the consular fasces on January 1, 287, Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor, he marched against the barbarians and, although they were not entirely dispersed, he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Bowman, 72. Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the Moselle-Vosges region to be the greatest threat, so he targeted them first. He campaigned using scorched earth tactics, laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni, Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person, riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies weakened from starvation, Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine.Barnes, New Empire, 57; Williams, 50. He moved deep into Germanic territory, bringing destruction to his enemies' homelands and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms. By the end of 287, he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen. Maximian's panegyrist declared: \\"All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman.\\"Panegyrici Latini 10(2).7.7, translated by Nixon in Nixon and Rodgers, quoted in Bowman, 72. Flavius Constantius, Maximian's praetorian prefect and husband to his daughter Theodora =Joint campaign against the Alamanni= Early the next year, as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Southern, 142‚Äì43; Williams, 50. The emperors met that year, but neither date nor place is known with certainty.Barnes, New Empire, 57; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 31. They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 31; Southern, 142‚Äì43; Williams, 50. Barnes (Constantine and Eusebius, 7) dates the meeting to after the campaign against the Alamanni. Later in the year, Maximian led a surprise invasion of the Agri Decumates ‚Äì a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory ‚Äì while Diocletian invaded Germany via Raetia. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance.Southern, 142‚Äì43; Williams, 50. They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximian's build-up to proceed without further disturbance.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Corcoran, \\"Before Constantine\\", 40; Southern, 143; Williams, 50. In the aftermath of the war, towns along the Rhine were rebuilt, bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne, and a military frontier was established, comprising forts, roads, and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum (Tournai, Belgium), Bavacum (Bavay, France), Atuatuca Tungrorum (Tongeren, Belgium), Mosae Trajectum (Maastricht, Netherlands), and Cologne connected points along the frontier.Williams, 50‚Äì51. =Constantius, Gennobaudes, and resettlement= In early 288, Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect Constantius Chlorus, husband of Maximian's daughter Theodora, to lead a campaign against Carausius' Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine estuaries, thwarting sea-attacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory, wreaking havoc, and reaching the North Sea. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes. Gennobaudes became Maximian's vassal and, with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes, Roman regional dominance was assured.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7; Bowman, 72; Williams, 51. Maximian allowed a settlement of Frisii, Salian Franks, Chamavi and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory, either between the Rhine and Waal rivers from Noviomagus (Nijmegen, Netherlands) to Traiectum, (Utrecht, Netherlands) or near Trier.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7. These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes, giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region. Later campaigns in Britain and Gaul =Failed expedition against Carausius= Carausius, rebel emperor of Roman Britain. Legend: IMP. CARAVSIVS P. F. AVG. / LEGion IIII FL ‚Äì ML (Londinium mint) By 289, Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius' Britain, but for some reason the plan failed. Maximian's panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign's prospects, but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it.Southern, 143. Constantius' panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm,Panegyrici Latini 8(5)12.2; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7, 288; Bowman, 72‚Äì73; Potter, 284‚Äì85, 650; Southern, 143; Williams, 55. but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat.Southern, 143; Williams, 55. Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after, perhaps on learning of Maximian's failure.Potter, 285; Southern, 144. Diocletian returned in haste to the West, reaching Emesa by May 10, 290,Codex Justinianus 9.41.9; Barnes, New Empire, 51; Potter, 285, 650. and Sirmium on the Danube by July 1, 290.Codex Justinianus 6.30.6; Barnes, New Empire, 52; Potter, 285, 650. Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8; Potter, 285. Crowds gathered to witness the event, and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry.Panegyrici Latini 11(3)10, quoted in Williams, 57. Potter, among others, has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian's continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret,Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8; Potter, 285, 288; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 69. and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors (the Tetrarchy).Potter, 285; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 69. Meanwhile, a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office.Panegyrici Latini 11(3)2.4, 8.1, 11.3‚Äì4, 12.2; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8, 288; Potter, 285, 650. The emperors would not meet again until 303.Potter, 285. Following Maximian's failure to invade in 289, an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius' rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part, Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul.Williams, 55‚Äì56, 62. Diocletian, however, would not tolerate this affront to his rule. Faced with Carausius' secession and further challenges on the Egyptian, Syrian, and Danubian borders, he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire.Williams, 62‚Äì64. On March 1, 293 at Milan, Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8‚Äì9; Barnes, New Empire, 4, 36‚Äì37; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64‚Äì65. On either the same day or a month later, Diocletian did the same for Galerius, thus establishing the \\"Tetrarchy\\", or \\"rule of four\\".Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8‚Äì9; Barnes, New Empire, 4, 38; Potter, 288; Southern, 146; Williams, 64‚Äì65. Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 8, 15; Williams, 71. =Campaign against Allectus= Allectus, Carausius' successor. Legend: IMP. C. ALLECTVS P. F. AVG. / VIRTVS AVGusti ‚Äì Senatus Consulto Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year, Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer, Allectus.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 15; Potter, 288; Rees, Layers of Loyalty, 99; Southern, 149‚Äì50; Williams, 71‚Äì72. Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius' Frankish allies, taking the title Germanicus maximus.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 15‚Äì16; Barnes, New Empire, 255. His sights now set on Britain, Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 15‚Äì16; Southern, 150. Maximian, still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius, was apprised of the invasion plans and, in mid-296, returned to Gaul.Barnes, New Empire, 58‚Äì59. There, he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius' Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain.Barnes, New Empire, 59; Southern, 150; Williams, 73. Allectus was killed on the North Downs in battle with Constantius' praetorian prefect, Asclepiodotus. Constantius himself had landed near Dubris (Dover) and marched on Londinium (London), whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.Southern, 150; Williams, 73‚Äì74; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16. Campaigns in North Africa With Constantius' victorious return, Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania (Northwest Africa).Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16; Southern, 150; Williams, 75. As Roman authority weakened during the third century, nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289, the governor of Mauretania Caesariensis (roughly modern Algeria) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and Quinquegentiani, but the raiders soon returned. In 296, Maximian raised an army, from Praetorian cohorts, Aquileian, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German auxiliaries, and Thracian recruits, advancing through Spain later that year.Barnes, New Empire, 59; Williams, 75. He may have defended the region against raiding MoorsBarnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16. before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into Mauretania Tingitana (roughly modern Morocco) to protect the area from Frankish pirates.Williams, 75. By March 297, Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy, and Maximian spent the winter of 297‚Äì298 resting in Carthage before returning to the field.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16; Barnes, New Empire, 59. Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the Atlas Mountains ‚Äì from which they could continue to wage war ‚Äì Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable, and the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare, but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes, he devastated previously secure land, killed as many as he could, and drove the remainder back into the Sahara.Odahl, 58; Williams, 75. His campaign was concluded by early 298 and, on March 10, he made a triumphal entry into Carthage.Barnes, New Empire, 59; Odahl, 58; Williams, 75. Inscriptions there record the people's gratitude to Maximian, hailing him ‚Äì as Constantius had been on his entry to London ‚Äì as redditor lucis aeternae (\\"restorer of the eternal light\\"). Maximian returned to Italy in early 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16; Barnes, New Empire, 59; Odahl, 58. After his Mauretanian campaign in 299, Maximian returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16; Barnes, New Empire, 56. Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius, and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators, to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several, including the prefect of Rome in 301/2.Lactantius, DMP 8.4; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 16. In contrast, Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 ‚Äì while Maximian was resting in Italy ‚Äì continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine. According to Aurelius Victor, he also built a palace near his home town of Sirmium.Aurelius Victor, Historia Romana, De Caesaribus In addition to the imperial palace in Sirmium another palace has been found at Glac which may be that of Maximian. Retirement Diocletian's vicennalia, the 20-year anniversary of his reign, was celebrated in Rome in 303. Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together, passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius.Panegyrici Latini 7(6)15.16; Lactantius DMP 20.4; Potter, 340; Southern, 152, 336. Presumably Maximian's son Maxentius and Constantius's son Constantine ‚Äì children raised in Nicomedia together ‚Äì would then become the new Caesars. While Maximian might not have wished to retire, Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement, Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the Secular Games in 304.Potter, 340. Silvered follis struck in Aquileia 305‚Äì306 AD commemorating Maximian's abdication. Legend: DN MAXIMIANVS BAEATISSIMO SEN. AVG. / PROVIDENTIA DEORVM QVIES AVGG. S F ‚Äì AQS (Aquileia mint) On May 1, 305, in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia, Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go entirely to Maximian's liking: perhaps because of Galerius' influence, Galerius' former army comrade Severus and Galerius' nephew Maximinus (both of whom had long military careers) were appointed Caesar, thus excluding Constantine and Maxentius.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 25‚Äì27; Williams, 191. Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy, which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held. Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as Caesar, within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son's rebellion against the new regime.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 25‚Äì27; Potter, 341‚Äì42. Diocletian retired to the expansive palace he had built in his homeland, Dalmatia near Salona on the Adriatic. Maximian retired to villas in Campania, Lucania or Sirmium, where he lived a life of ease and luxury.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 27; Southern, 152. Although far from the political centers of the Empire, Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.Southern, 152. Maxentius' rebellion After the death of Constantius on July 25, 306, Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius, who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted. The title of Augustus then went to Severus.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 27‚Äì28; Barnes, New Empire, 5; Lenski, 61‚Äì62; Odahl, 78‚Äì79. Maxentius was jealous of Constantine's power, and on October 28, 306, he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him Augustus. Uncomfortable with sole leadership, Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as \\"Augustus for the second time\\", offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 30‚Äì32. Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus' soldiers had served under Maximian, and had taken Maxentius' bribes, most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to Ravenna, which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms, which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome, where he was kept as a hostage. In late 307, Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome, and retreated north with his army mostly intact.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 30‚Äì31; Elliott, 41‚Äì42; Lenski, 62‚Äì63; Odahl, 86‚Äì87; Potter, 348‚Äì49. Dresden bust of Maxentius While Maxentius built up Rome's defenses, Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximian's younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius' secessionist regime. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and support Maxentius' cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in late 307, at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 31; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 87‚Äì88; Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 15‚Äì16. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307‚Äì8 but soon fell out with his son and in early 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Rome's sickly government, disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it, and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius' shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius, and Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 32; Lenski, 64; Odahl, 89, 93. On November 11, 308, to resolve the political instability, Galerius called Diocletian (out of retirement) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube. There, Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar, with Maximinus the Caesar in the east. Licinius, a loyal military companion to Galerius, was appointed Augustus of the West.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 32‚Äì34; Elliott, 42‚Äì43; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90‚Äì91; Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 17; Potter, 349‚Äì50; Treadgold, 29. In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul, the only court that would still accept him.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 32. After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of Sons of the Augusti, they were promoted in early 310, with the result that there were now four Augusti.Cary and Scullard, A History of Rome, p522 Rebellion against Constantine Marble head of Constantine In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple. Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him, most of Constantine's army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave the city. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia (Marseille). The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 34‚Äì35; Elliott, 43; Lenski, 65‚Äì66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 17; Potter, 352. Despite the earlier rupture in relations, after Maximian's suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father's devoted son.Elliott, 43; Lenski, 68; Pohlsander, Emperor Constantine, 20. He minted coins bearing his father's deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.Barnes, New Empire, 34; Elliott, 45; Lenski, 68. Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.Lactantius, DMP 30.1; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 40‚Äì41, 305. In addition to the propaganda, Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 41; Lenski, 68. Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on October 28, 312. Maxentius died, and Italy came under Constantine's rule.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 42‚Äì44. Eutropia swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian's son, and Maximian's memory was rehabilitated. His apotheosis under Maxentius was declared null and void, and he was re-consecrated as a god, probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantine's coinage as divus, or divine, by 318, together with the deified Constantius and Claudius Gothicus.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 47; Barnes, New Empire, 35. The three were hailed as Constantine's forebears. They were called \\"the best of emperors\\".Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 47. Through his daughters Fausta and Flavia, Maximian was grandfather or great-grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363.Barnes, New Empire, 265‚Äì66.

The first known racemic mixture was racemic acid, which Louis Pasteur found to be a mixture of the two enantiomeric isomers of tartaric acid. A sample with only a single enantiomer is an enantiomerically pure or enantiopure compound. Etymology From racemic acid found in grapes; from Latin racemus, meaning a bunch of grapes. This acid, when naturally produced in grapes, is only the right-handed version of the molecule, better known as tartaric acid. Moreover, in many Germanic languages racemic acid is called ‚Äúgrape acid‚Äù e.g. traubensaure (GER) or druvsyra (SWE). Carl von Linn√© gave red elderberry the scientific name Sambucus racemosa as the Swedish name, druvfl√§der, translates to grape elder. That name in turn relates to that the berries grow in a grape-like cluster....  Nomenclature  A racemic mixture is denoted by the prefix (¬±)- or dl- (for sugars the prefix - may be used), indicating an equal (1:1) mixture of dextro and levo isomers. Also the prefix rac- (or racem-) or the symbols RS and SR (all in italic letters) are used. If the ratio is not 1:1 (or is not known), the prefix (+)/(‚àí), - or d/l- (with a slash) is used instead. The usage of d and l is strongly discouraged by IUPAC.G.P. Moss: Basic terminology of stereochemistry ( Recommendations 1996); Pure Appl. Chem., 1996, Vol. 68, No. 12, p. 2205-2216; Nomenclature of Carbohydrates (Recommendations 1996), 2-Carb-4. ‚Äì Configurational symbols and prefixes Properties A racemate is optically inactive, meaning that there is no net rotation of plane-polarized light. Although the two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, the rotations cancel because they are present in equal amounts. In contrast to the two pure enantiomers, which have identical physical properties except for the direction of rotation of plane-polarized light, a racemate sometimes has different properties from either of the pure enantiomers. Different melting points are most common, but different solubilities and boiling points are also possible. Pharmaceuticals may be available as a racemate or as the pure enantiomer, which might have different potencies. Because biological systems have many chiral asymmetries, pure enantiomers frequently have very different biological effects; examples include glucose and methamphetamine. Crystallization There are four ways in which a racemate can be crystallized, depending on the substance; three of which H. W. B. Roozeboom had distinguished by 1899: ;Conglomerate (sometimes racemic conglomerate):If the molecules of the substance have a much greater affinity for the same enantiomer than for the opposite one, a mechanical mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals will result. The mixture of enantiomerically pure R and S crystals forms a eutectic mixture. Consequently, the melting point of the conglomerate is always lower than that of the pure enantiomer. Addition of a small amount of one enantiomer to the conglomerate increases the melting point. Roughly 10% of racemic chiral compounds crystallize as conglomerates. ;Racemic compound (sometimes true racemate):If molecules have a greater affinity for the opposite enantiomer than for the same enantiomer, the substance forms a single crystalline phase in which the two enantiomers are present in an ordered 1:1 ratio in the elementary cell. Adding a small amount of one enantiomer to the racemic compound decreases the melting point. But the pure enantiomer can have a higher or lower melting point than the compound. A special case of racemic compounds are kryptoracemic compounds (or kryptoracemates), in which the crystal itself has handedness (is enantiomorphic), despite containing both enantiomorphs in a 1:1 ratio. ;Pseudoracemate (sometimes racemic solid solution): When there is no big difference in affinity between the same and opposite enantiomers, then in contrast to the racemic compound and the conglomerate, the two enantiomers will coexist in an unordered manner in the crystal lattice. Addition of a small amount of one enantiomer changes the melting point slightly or not at all. ;Quasiracemate: A quasiracemate is a co-crystal of two similar but distinct compounds, one of which is left-handed and the other right-handed. Although chemically different, they are sterically similar (isosteric) and are still able to form a racemic crystalline phase. One of the first such racemates studied, by Pasteur in 1853, forms from a 1:2 mixture of the bis ammonium salt of (+)-tartaric acid and the bis ammonium salt of (‚àí)-malic acid in water. Re-investigated in 2008,Rediscovering Pasteur's Quasiracemates Kraig A. Wheeler, Rebecca C. Grove, Raymond E. Davis, and W. Scott Kassel Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 78 ‚Äì81 the crystals formed are dumbbell-shape with the central part consisting of ammonium (+)-bitartrate, whereas the outer parts are a quasiracemic mixture of ammonium (+)-bitartrate and ammonium (‚àí)-bimalate. Resolution The separation of a racemate into its components, the pure enantiomers, is called a chiral resolution. There are various methods, including crystallization, chromatography, and the use of enzymes. The first successful resolution of a racemate was performed by Louis Pasteur, who manually separated the crystals of a conglomerate. Synthesis Without a chiral influence (for example a chiral catalyst, solvent or starting material), a chemical reaction that makes a chiral product will always yield a racemate. That can make the synthesis of a racemate cheaper and easier than making the pure enantiomer, because it does not require special conditions. This fact also leads to the question of how biological homochirality evolved on what is presumed to be a racemic primordial earth. The reagents of, and the reactions that produce, racemic mixtures are said to be \\"not stereospecific\\" or \\"not stereoselective\\", for their indecision in a particular stereoisomerism. A frequent scenario is that of a planar species (such as an sp2 carbon atom or a carbocation intermediate) acting as an electrophile. The nucleophile will have a 50% probability of 'hitting' either of the two sides of the planar grouping, thus producing a racemic mixture: center Racemic pharmaceuticals Some drug molecules are chiral, and the enantiomers have different effects on biological entities. They can be sold as one enantiomer or as a racemic mixture. Examples include thalidomide, ibuprofen, cetirizine and salbutamol. Adderall is an unequal mixture of both amphetamine enantiomers. A single amphetamine dose combines the neutral sulfate salts of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and D/L-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. The prescription analgesic tramadol is also a racemate. In some cases (e.g., ibuprofen and thalidomide), the enantiomers interconvert or racemize in vivo. This means that preparing a pure enantiomer for medication is largely pointless. However, sometimes samples containing pure enantiomers may be made and sold at a higher cost in cases where the use requires specifically one isomer (e.g., for a stereospecific reagent); compare omeprazole and esomeprazole. While often only one enantiomer of the drug may be active, there are cases in which the other enantiomer is harmful, like salbutamol(R)-Albuterol for Asthma: Pro, Bill T. Ameredes and William J. Calhoun and thalidomide. The (R) enantiomer of thalidomide is effective against morning sickness, while the (S) enantiomer is teratogenic, causing birth defects. Since the drug racemizes, the drug cannot be considered safe for use by women of child-bearing age, and its use is tightly controlled when used for treating other illness. Methamphetamine is available by prescription under the brand name Desoxyn. The active component of Desoxyn is dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. This is the right-handed isomer of methamphetamine. The left-handed isomer of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an OTC drug that is less centrally-acting and more peripherally-acting. Wallach's rule Wallach's rule (first proposed by Otto Wallach) states that racemic crystals tend to be denser than their chiral counterparts.(Wallach, O. (1895). Liebigs Ann. Chem. 286, 90‚Äì143.) This rule has been substantiated by crystallographic database analysis.

Although many factors can cause phocomelia, the prominent roots come from the use of the drug thalidomide and from genetic inheritance. Occurrence in an individual results in various abnormalities to the face, limbs, ears, nose, vessels and many other underdevelopments. Although operations may improve some abnormalities, many are not surgically treatable due to the lack of nerves and other related structures. The term is from Ancient Greek œÜœéŒ∫Œ∑ ph≈çkƒì, \\"seal (animal)\\" + -o- interfix + ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ melos, \\"limb\\" + English suffix -ia). Phocomelia is an extremely rare congenital disorder involving malformation of the limbs (dysmelia). √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire coined the term in 1836. Signs and symptoms Phocomelia manifest as aural abnormalities. Eyesight limitation from phocomelia. The symptoms of phocomelia syndrome are undeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones; however, various abnormalities can occur to the limbs and bones. Usually the upper limbs are not fully formed and sections of the \\"hands and arms may be missing.\\" Short arm bones, fused fingers, and missing thumbs will often occur. Sometimes hands or fingers will be present but limp due to having no bones or being loosely attached. Legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands. Individuals with phocomelia will often lack thigh bones, and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close \\"attachment to the body.\\" According to National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) , individuals carrying phocomelia syndrome will generally show symptoms of growth retardation previous to and after birth. The syndrome can also cause severe mental deficiencies in infants. Infants born with phocomelia will normally have a petite head with \\"sparse hair\\" that may appear \\"silvery- blonde.\\" Hemangioma, the abnormal buildup of blood vessels, will possibly develop around the facial area at birth and the eyes may be set widely apart, a condition known as orbital hypertelorism. The pigment of the eyes will be a bluish white. Phocomelia can also cause: an undeveloped nose with slender nostrils, disfigured ears, irregularly petite jaws (a condition known as micrognathia), and a cleft lip with cleft palate. According to NORD, severe symptoms of phocomelia include: *A fissure of the skull and a projecting brain known as (encephalocele) *An accumulation of spinal fluid under the skull also known as hydrocephalus; causing vomiting and migraines *An abnormally shaped uterus (bicornuate) *Inability to clot blood efficiently due to a low amount of platelets running through the blood *Malformations in the kidney and heart *Shortened neck *Abnormalities in the urethra =Thalidomide syndrome symptoms= When an individual is born with phocomelia due to drugs or pharmaceuticals, it is known as thalidomide syndrome. The symptoms of thalidomide syndrome are defined by absent or shortened limbs; causing flipper hands and feet. According to Anthony J Perri III, and Sylvia Hsu they can additionally receive: *Palsy disorder of the face *Ear and eye abnormalities; resulting in limited/complete loss of hearing or sight *Gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract disorders *Ingrown genitalia *Undeveloped/missing lungs *Distorted digestive tract, heart, kidney *disorders to the limbs The infants that were exposed to thalidomide during development phases had a 40% chance of survival. The McMredie-McBride hypothesis explains that the limbs of the infants become malformed as a result of the thalidomide harming the neural tissue‚Äîsimply because the neural tissue has such a large impact on formation and development of the limbs. Causes =Thalidomide= Thalidomide was released onto the market in 1958 in West Germany under the label of Contergan. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure \\"anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension\\". Afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over-the-counter drug in Germany around 1960 and could be bought without a prescription. Shortly after the drug was sold, in Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with phocomelia. Only 40% of these children survived. Research also proves that although phocomelia did exist through the 1940s and 1950s, cases of severe phocomelia multiplied in the 1960s, when thalidomide was released in Germany; the direct cause was traced to thalidomide.\\"Pharmaceutical Teratogens.\\" Teratology SocietyBirth Defects Research. 8 December 2007. The statistic was given that \\"50 percent of the mothers with deformed children had taken thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy.\\" Throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States, 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Thalidomide became effectively linked to death or severe disabilities among babies. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included: deformed eyes, hearts, alimentary, and urinary tracts, and blindness and deafness. =Genetic inheritance= According to National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD): when phocomelia is transmitted [in its familial genetic form] it is seen as an autosomal recessive trait and the mutation is linked to chromosome 8. A study of Roberts Syndrome, a genetic disorder showing similar symptoms to phocomelia, has shed light on the possible causes. An individual afflicted with Roberts Syndrome will have chromosome copies that do not connect at the centromeres, making them unable to line up accordingly. As a result, the newly made cells contain an excess or reduced number of chromosomes. In both Roberts Syndrome and phocomelia the cells cease to develop, or die, preventing proper development of the limbs, eyes, brain, palate, or other structures. Treatment Prosthesis is a synthetic alternative for missing limbs, teeth, and various other body parts. Advances in prosthetic limbs have increased greatly during the twentieth century. The use of new materials such as modern plastics, complex procedures and better pigments have created lighter in weight and more realistic looking artificial limbs. With the advancement of myoelectric prosthetic limbs, patients are able to move their limbs without the use of cords or other devices. The myoelectric limbs can detect electric signals from the nervous system and muscles. They were first used on adults, but now they are being fitted to children. Patients that receive a loss of limbs due to phocomelia are typically treated with prosthetics. Infants at the age of six months are recommended to have a prosthetic mitten fitted; enabling them to get used to the prosthesis. A hook will be added when the child reaches the age of two years. Eventually the patient may receive a myoelectric prosthetic limb. Patients are treated in this way due to the lack of understanding at a young age and the absence of necessary tissues and bones to hold the prosthetic limb. Notable cases *Mat Fraser was born with phocomelia due to his mother taking thalidomide while she was pregnant. He is known as the drummer of rock bands including Fear of Sex, The Reasonable Strollers, Joyride, The Grateful Dub, and Living in Texas. He is also an actor and performing artist. *Alison Lapper was born with phocomelia. She is arm deficient and has shortened bones and legs. Lapper graduated from Brighton University in 1994, established herself as a visual artist, and in 2000 gave birth to a son, Parys. Lapper produces cards and calendars for The Mouth and Foot Painters' Association. She does not wear prosthetic limbs. *Ronan Tynan was born with phocomelia. He became a track and field athlete, competing in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics. Tynan went on to a career as a physician, and later, a singer. *Ame Barnbrook was born without arms and only the lower half of her left leg, and three toes. She has a rarer form of phocomelia, meaning all of her limbs are affected. She graduated from the University of Wollongong with a Bachelor of Creative Arts. Barnbrook plays the trumpet with her foot (she has three toes) and is a competitive sailor. She sails a SKUD18SKUD18 at skud.org at world championship level.

W. Roller, The World of Juba II and Kleopatra Selene, 2003, p. 77 was a Ptolemaic prince and was a son of the Macedonian queen Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt by Roman triumvir Mark Antony. Alexander's fraternal twin sister was Cleopatra Selene II. Cleopatra named her son after Alexander the Great. His second name in Ancient Greek means \\"Sun\\"; this was the counterpart of his twin sister's second name Selene (Œ£ŒµŒªŒÆŒΩŒ∑), meaning \\"Moon\\". Life Alexander Helios was born and educated in Alexandria. He was the second of Cleopatra's three sons, Caesarion being the oldest. In late 34 BC, at the Donations of Alexandria, he was given the title of \\"King of Kings\\". His parents also made him ruler of Armenia, Media, Parthia and any countries yet to be discovered between the Euphrates and Indus Rivers, despite the fact that most of this territory stood outside of their control at that time.Plutarch, Antony 54.6-9; Cassius Dio xlix. 41.1-3; Livy, periochae 131 These areas were, in fact, already ruled by Artaxias II of Armenia (who had been elected King that same year after Antony captured his father Artavasdes II), Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene and Phraates IV of Parthia. In 33 BC, Alexander was engaged to his distant relative Iotapa, a princess of Media Atropatene and daughter of Artavasdes I. However, Mark Antony and Cleopatra were defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. The next year, they committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. Iotapa left Egypt to return to her father and later married her maternal cousin King Mithridates III of Commagene, who was of Armenian and Greek descent.Cassius Dio xlix. 40.2; xlix. 44.1-4; li. 16.2; Plutarch, Antony 53.12 When Octavian conquered Egypt, he spared Alexander, but took him, his sister and his brother, Ptolemy Philadelphus from Egypt to Rome. Octavian celebrated his military triumph in Rome by parading the children in heavy golden chains in the streets behind an effigy of their mother clutching an asp to her arm. It is unclear whether Ptolemy Philadelphus survived the journey to Rome, as Cassius Dio only mentions the twins in his History of Rome.Cassius Dio li. 21.8 Octavian gave the children to Octavia Minor, his elder sister and a former wife of Mark Antony, to be raised under her guardianship in Rome. They were generously received by Octavia, who educated them with her own children.Plutarch, Antony 87.1; Suetonius, Augustus 17.5 =Later life= The fate of Alexander Helios is unknown.

V. Hill, was a British physiologist, one of the founders of the diverse disciplines of biophysics and operations research. He shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his elucidation of the production of heat and mechanical work in muscles. Biography Born in Mexico, he was educated at Blundell's School and graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge as third wrangler in the mathematics tripos before turning to physiology. While still an undergraduate at Trinity College, he derived in 1909 what came to be known as the Langmuir equation. This is closely related to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In this paper, Hill's first publication, he derived both the equilibrium form of the Langmuir equation, and also the exponential approach to equilibrium. The paper, written under the supervision of John Newport Langley, is a landmark in the history of receptor theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the \\"receptive substance\\" at the neuromuscular junction. While a student he had enrolled in the Officers Training Course; he was a crack shot. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hill became the musketry officer of the Cambridgeshire Regiment. The British made no effort to make use of their scientists. At the end of 1915, while home on leave he was asked by Horace Darwin from the Ministry of Munitions to come for a day to advise them on how to train anti-aircraft gunners. On site, Hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplanes' heights. Transferred to Munitions, he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fitted this data with the equations describing a shell's flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns. To measure and compute he assembled a team of men too old for conscription, Ralph H. Fowler (a wounded officer), and lads too young for service including Douglas Hartree and Arthur Milne. Someone dubbed his motley group \\"Hill's Brigands\\", which they proudly adopted. Later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound. He sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle. At the end of the war Major Hill issued certificates to more than one hundred Brigands. He was awarded an OBE. In 1923 he succeeded Ernest Starling as professor of physiology at University College London, a few years later becoming a Royal Society Research professor there, where he remained until retirement in 1951. In 1933, he became with Lord Beveridge and Lord Rutherford a founder member and vice-president of the Academic Assistance Council (which in 1936 became the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning). By the start of the Second World War, the organisation had saved 900 academics (18 of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes) from Nazi persecution. He prominently displayed in his laboratory a toy figure of Adolf Hitler with saluting arm upraised, which he explained was in gratitude for all the scientists Germany had expelled, some of whom were now working with him. Hill believed that \\"Laughter is the best detergent for nonsense\\".Van der Kloot 2014, p. 202. In 1945 he served with Patrick Blackett and Sir Henry Tizard on the committee that gave birth to radar. He was also biological secretary of the Royal Society; William Henry Bragg was president. Both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war. The Royal Society collated a list of scientists and Hill represented the Society at the Ministry of Labor. When the war came Hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned. He served as an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridge University from 1940 to 1945. In 1940 he was posted to the British Embassy in Washington to promote war research in the still neutral United States. He was authorized to swap secrets with the Americans, but this could not work: how do you place a value on another's secret? Hill saw the answer and persuaded the British to show the Americans everything they were working on (except for the atomic bomb). The mobilization of Allied scientist was one of the major successes in the war. After the war he rebuilt his laboratory at University College and vigorously carried on research. In 1951 his advocacy was rewarded by the establishment of a Biophysics Department under his leadership. In 1952 he became head of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and Secretary General of the International Union of Scientific Organizations. He was President of the Marine Biological Association from 1955 to 1960. In 1967 he retired to Cambridge where he gradually lost the use of his legs. He died \\"held in the greatest affection by more than a hundred scientific descendants all over the world\\".Katz 1978. p. 133.  Cooperativity of protein binding and enzyme kinetics  Although Hill's work in muscle physiology is probably the most important, and certainly responsible for his Nobel Prize, he is also very well known in biochemistry for the Hill equation, which he used to quantify binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, written here as a kinetic equation, as it is mainly used for that: v = \\\\frac{Va^h}{K_{0.5}^h + a^h} Here v is the rate of reaction at concentration a of substrate, V is the rate at saturation, {K_{0.5}} is the value of a that gives v = 0.5V, and the exponent h is a parameter that expresses the degree of departure from Michaelis-Menten kinetics: positive cooperativity for h>1, no cooperativity for h=1, and negative cooperativity for h<1. Note that there is no implication that h is an integer, and in most experimental cases, apart from the trivial case of h=1, it is not. Although many authors use n or {n_\\\\mathrm{H}} rather than h these symbols are misleading if taken to imply that it shows the number of binding sites on the protein. Hill himself avoided any such interpretation. The equation can be rearranged as follows: \\\\ln [v/(V-v )] = h \\\\ln a - h \\\\ln K_{0.5} This shows that when the Hill equation is accurately obeyed (which usually it is not) a plot of \\\\ln [v/(V-v)] gives a straight line of slope h. This is called a Hill plot.  Muscle physiology  Hill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax. A key finding was that heat is produced during contraction, which requires investment of chemical energy, but not during relaxation, which is passive. His earliest measurements used equipment left behind by the Swedish physiologist Magnus Blix, Hill measured a temperature rise of only 0.003 ¬∞C. After publication he learned that German physiologists had already reported on heat and muscle contraction and he went to Germany to learn more about their work. He continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his thermocouple. Hill is regarded, along with Hermann Helmholtz, as one of the founders of biophysics. Hill returned briefly to Cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the Victoria University of Manchester in 1920 in succession to William Stirling. Using himself as the subject he ran every morning from 7:15 to 10:30 he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by increased oxygen consumption. Paralleling the work of German Otto Fritz Meyerhof, Hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles. The two shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for this work. Hill introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922. Personal life In 1913 he married Margaret Keynes (1885-1974), daughter of the economist John Neville Keynes, and sister of the economist John Maynard Keynes and the surgeon Geoffrey Keynes. They had two sons and two daughters: * Polly Hill (1914‚Äì2005), economist, married K.A.C. Humphreys, registrar of the West African Examinations Council. *David Keynes Hill (1915‚Äì2002), physiologist, married Stella Mary Humphrey *Maurice Hill (1919‚Äì1966), oceanographer, married Philippa Pass * Janet Hill (1918‚Äì2000) child psychiatrist, married the immunologist John Herbert Humphrey.

On 9 September 2015 an English Heritage Blue plaque was erected at Hill's former home, 16 Bishopswood Road, Highgate, where he had lived from 1923‚Äì1967. Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by Highgate School, where Hill was a Governor from 1929‚Äì1960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill's time, according to his grandson Nicholas Humphrey, regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist John Maynard Keynes, and friends Stephen Hawking and Sigmund Freud. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. ‚ÄúEvery Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa‚Äôs house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep‚Äôs eye.‚Äù Sir Ralph Kohn FRS who proposed the Blue plaque, said: ‚ÄúThe Nobel Prize winner A.

Viewed from satellite photos, the cloud appears as a giant brown stain hanging in the air over much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean every year between January and March, possibly also during earlier and later months. The term was coined in reports from the UNEP Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX).Ramanathan, Veerabhadran et al. (2002) The Asian brown cloud climate and other environmental impacts: impact study Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate, United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi Kenya, , accessed 8 December 2008 The term atmospheric brown cloud is used for a more generic context not specific to the Asian region. Causes The Asian brown cloud is created by a range of airborne particles and pollutants from combustion (e.g., woodfires, cars, and factories), biomass burning and industrial processes with incomplete burning. The cloud is associated with the winter monsoon (November/December to April) during which there is no rain to wash pollutants from the air.Petit, C. W.

Scientists in India claimed that the Asian Brown cloud is not something specific to Asia. Subsequently, when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) organized a follow-up international project, the subject of study was renamed the Atmospheric Brown Cloud with focus on Asia. The cloud was also reported by NASA in 2004NASA Eyes Effects of a Giant 'Brown Cloud' Worldwide (2004) and 2007.Global Aerosol System 2000-2007 (NASA Earth Observatory) Although aerosol particles are generally associated with a global cooling effect, recent studies have shown that they can actually have a warming effect in certain regions such as the Himalayas. Impacts =Health problems= One major impact is on health. A 2002 study indicated nearly two million people die each year, in Asia alone, from conditions related to the brown cloud. =Regional weather= A second assessment study was published in 2008. It highlighted regional concerns regarding: * Changes of rainfall patterns with the Asian monsoon, as well as a delaying of the start of the Asian monsoon, by several weeks.Brown cloud delaying monsoon.Paper reporting the delaying of the monsoon being caused by brown cloud The observed weakening Indian monsoon and in China northern drought and southern flooding is influenced by the clouds. * Increase in rainfall over the Australian Top End and Kimberley regions. A CSIRO study has found that by displacing the thermal equator southwards via cooling of the air over East Asia, the monsoon which brings most of the rain to these regions has been intensified and displaced southward. * Retreat of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan glaciers and snow packs. The cause is attributed to rising air temperatures that are more pronounced in elevated regions, a combined warming effect of greenhouse gases and the Asian Brown Cloud. Also deposition of black carbon decreases the reflection and exacerbates the retreat. Asian glacial melting could lead to water shortages and floods for the hundreds of millions of people who live downstream. * Decrease of crop harvests. Elevated concentrations of surface ozone are likely to affect crop yields negatively. The impact is crop specific. =Cyclone intensity in Arabian Sea= A 2011 study found that pollution is making Arabian Sea cyclones more intense as the atmospheric brown clouds has been producing weakening wind patterns which prevent wind shear patterns that historically have prohibited cyclones in the Arabian Sea from becoming major storms. This phenomenon was found responsible for the formation of stronger storms in 2007 and 2010 that were the first recorded storms to enter the Gulf of Oman. =Global warming and dimming= The 2008 report also addressed the global concern of warming and concluded that the brown clouds have masked 20 to 80 percent of greenhouse gas forcing in the past century. The report suggested that air pollution regulations can have large amplifying effects on global warming. Another major impact is on the polar ice caps. Black carbon (soot) in the Asian Brown Cloud may be reflecting sunlight and dimming Earth below but it is warming other places by absorbing incoming radiation and warming the atmosphere and whatever it touches. Black carbon is three times more effective than carbon dioxide‚Äîthe most common greenhouse gas‚Äîat melting polar ice and snow. Black carbon in snow causes about three times the temperature change as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. On snow‚Äîeven at concentrations below five parts per billion‚Äìdark carbon triggers melting, and may be responsible for as much as 94 percent of Arctic warming.

Caesarion was the eldest son of Cleopatra and possibly the only biological son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. He was the last sovereign member of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Early life Ptolemy Philopator Philometor Caesar () was born in Egypt on 23 June 47 BC. His mother Cleopatra insisted that he was the son of Roman politician and dictator Julius Caesar, and while he was said to have inherited Caesar's looks and manner, Caesar did not officially acknowledge him. One of Caesar's supporters, Gaius Oppius, even wrote a pamphlet which attempted to prove that Caesar could not have fathered Caesarion. Nevertheless, Caesar may have allowed Caesarion to use his name.Duane W. Roller, Cleopatra: A Biography, Oxford University Press US, 2010, pp. 70‚Äì3 The matter became contentious when Caesar's adopted son, Octavian, came into conflict with Cleopatra. In some medical literature, Caesarion is said to have suffered from epilepsy, a neurological condition apparently inherited from his father. This thesis has been disputed by paleopathologist Francesco M. Galassi and surgeon Hutan Ashrafian, who have argued that the first mention of potential epileptic attacks can only be found in 20th-century novels, instead of ancient primary sources. Additionally, they claimed that this controversial assumption had been mistakenly used in the historico-medical debate on Julius Caesar's alleged epilepsy to strengthen the notion that the dictator really suffered from that disease. Caesarion spent two of his infant years, from 46 to 44 BC, in Rome, where he and his mother were Caesar's guests at his villa, Horti Caesaris. Cleopatra hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the Roman Republic, as well as of Egypt. After Caesar's assassination on 15 March 44 BC, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt. Caesarion was named co-ruler by his mother on 2 September 44 BC at the age of three, although he was pharaoh in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority. Cleopatra compared her relationship to her son with that of the Egyptian goddess Isis and her divine child Horus. There is no historical record of Caesarion between 44 BC until the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC. Two years later he also appears at the Donations of Alexandria. Cleopatra and Antony staged both \\"Donations\\" to donate lands dominated by Rome and Parthia to Cleopatra's children: Caesarion, the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus (the last three were his maternal half-siblings fathered by Mark Antony). Octavian gave public approval to the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC, which have been described as an Antonian strategy to rule the East making use of Cleopatra's unique royal Seleucid lineage in the regions donated.  Pharaoh  In 34 BC, Antony granted further eastern lands and titles to Caesarion and his own three children with Cleopatra in the Donations of Alexandria. Caesarion was proclaimed to be a god, a son of [a] god, and \\"King of Kings\\". This grandiose title was \\"unprecedented in the management of Roman client-king relationships\\" and could be seen as \\"threatening the 'greatness' of the Roman people\\". Antony also declared Caesarion to be Caesar's true son and heir. This declaration was a direct threat to Octavian (whose claim to power was based on his status as Julius Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son). These proclamations partly caused the fatal breach in Antony's relations with Octavian, who used Roman resentment over the Donations to gain support for war against Antony and Cleopatra.  Death  Roman painting from Pompeii, early 1st century AD, most likely depicting Cleopatra VII, wearing her royal diadem, consuming poison in an act of suicide, while Caesarion, also wearing a royal diadem, stands behind her After the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Cleopatra seems to have groomed Caesarion to take over as \\"sole ruler without his mother\\". She may have intended to go into exile, perhaps with Antony, who may have hoped that he would be allowed to retire as Lepidus had. Caesarion reappears in the historical record in 30 BC, when Octavian invaded Egypt and searched for him. Cleopatra may have sent Caesarion, 17 years old at the time, to the Red Sea port of Berenice for safety, possibly as part of plans for an escape to India; he may have been sent years earlier, but the sources are unclear. Plutarch does say that Caesarion was sent to India, but also that he was lured back by false promises of the kingdom of Egypt: > Caesarion, who was said to be Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar, was sent by > his mother, with much treasure, into India, by way of Ethiopia. There > Rhodon, another tutor like Theodorus, persuaded him to go back, on the > ground that [Octavian] Caesar invited him to take the kingdom.Plutarch, Life > of Antony. As found in the Loeb Classical Library, Plutarch's Lives: With an > English Translation by Bernadotte Perrin. Volume 9. p. 321. Octavian captured the city of Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC, the date that marks the official annexation of Egypt to the Roman Republic. Around this time Mark Antony and Cleopatra died, traditionally said to be by suicide, though murder has been suggested. Details of the narratives in Plutarch are generally challenged and not taken literally.The Victorian scholar Arthur Hugh Clough, who updated the poet John Dryden's superb translation of Plutarch to give us the best available version in English, remarked in an introduction: It cannot be denied that [Plutarch] is careless about numbers, and occasionally contradicts his own statements. A greater fault, perhaps, is his passion for anecdote; he cannot forbear from repeating stories, the improbability of which he is the first to recognise. Caesarion's guardians, including his tutor, were themselves either lured by false promises of mercy into returning him to Alexandria or simply betrayed him; the records are unclear. Octavian is supposed to have had Pharaoh Caesarion executed in Alexandria, following the advice of Arius Didymus, who said \\"Too many Caesars is not good\\" (a pun on a line in Homer).David Braund et al, Myth, History and Culture in Republican Rome: Studies in Honour of T.P. Wiseman, University of Exeter Press, 2003, p. 305\\\\. The original line was \\"ŒøœÖŒ∫ Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏œåŒΩ œÄŒøŒªœÖŒ∫ŒøŒπœÅŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ∑\\" (\\"ouk agathon polukoiranie\\"): \\"too many leaders are not good\\", or \\"the rule of many is a bad thing\\". (Homer's Iliad, Book II. vers 204‚Äì205) In Greek \\"ŒøœÖŒ∫ Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏œåŒΩ œÄŒøŒªœÖŒ∫Œ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅŒØŒ∑\\" (\\"ouk agathon polukaisarie\\") is a variation on \\"ŒøœÖŒ∫ Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏œåŒΩ œÄŒøŒªœÖŒ∫ŒøŒπœÅŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ∑\\" (\\"ouk agathon polukoiranie\\"). \\"ŒöŒ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅ\\" (Caesar) replacing \\"Œ∫ŒøŒØœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ\\", meaning leader. It is popularly thought that he was strangled, but the exact circumstances of his death have not been documented. Octavian then assumed absolute control of Egypt. The year 30 BC was considered the first year of the new ruler's reign according to the traditional chronological system of Egypt. Depictions File:Venus and Cupid from the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII.jpgThis mid-1st century BC Roman wall painting in Pompeii, Italy, showing Venus holding a cupid is most likely a depiction of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt as Venus Genetrix, with her son Caesarion as the cupid.The wall-painting of Venus Genetrix is similar in appearance to the now-lost statue of Cleopatra erected by Julius Caesar in the Temple of Venus Genetrix, within the Forum of Caesar. The owner of the House at Pompeii of Marcus Fabius Rufus, walled off the room with this painting, most likely in immediate reaction to the execution of Caesarion on orders of Augustus in 30 BC, when artistic depictions of Caesarion would have been considered a sensitive issue for the ruling regime. File:Statue of Horus in Edfu Temple.jpgOne of two statues of the falcon god Horus behind a smaller depiction of Caesarion at the Temple of Edfu in Edfu, Upper Egypt Few images of Caesarion survive. He is thought to be depicted in a partial statue found in the harbor of Alexandria in 1997 and is also portrayed twice in relief, as an adult pharaoh, with his mother on the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. His infant image appears on some bronze coins of Cleopatra. Egyptian names In addition to his Greek name and nicknames, Caesarion also had a full set of royal names in the Egyptian language: *Iwapanetjer entynehem ‚Äì \\"Heir of the god who saves\\" *Setepenptah ‚Äì \\"Chosen of Ptah\\" *Irmaatenre ‚Äì \\"Carrying out the rule of Ra\\" or \\"Sun of righteousness\\" *Sekhemankhamun ‚Äì \\"Living image of Amun\\"Peter Clayton (1994), Chronicle of the Pharaohs, As a fictional character * Caesarion is a lead character in Michael Livingston's 2015 historical fantasy novel The Shards of Heaven.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 21 April 1774 ‚Äì 3 February 1862) was a French physicist, astronomer, and mathematician who co-discovered the Biot-Savart law of magnetostatics, established the reality of meteorites, made an early balloon flight, and studied the polarization of light. The mineral biotite and Cape Biot in Greenland were named in his honor.  Biography  Jean-Baptiste Biot was born in Paris on 21 April 1774 the son of Joseph Biot, a treasury official.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was educated at Lyceum Louis-le-Grand and √âcole Polytechnique in 1794. Biot served in the artillery before he was appointed professor of mathematics at Beauvais in 1797. He later went on to become a professor of physics at the Coll√®ge de France around 1800, and three years later was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences. In July 1804, Biot was on board for the first scientific hot-air balloon ride with Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac to measure how the Earth's magnetic field varied with elevation (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004,K. M. Reese, Chemical & Engineering News, Vol 82 (2004) https://cen.acs.org/articles/82/i25/Newscripts.html O‚ÄôConnor and Robertson 1997). They reached a height of 4000 metres (13,100 feet) (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004). Later, in Sept. 1804, Gay-Lussac did a solo flight that took him up to 7010 metres (23,000 ft) (quite dangerous without supplementary oxygen (Reese 2004)). Biot was also a member of the Legion of Honor; he was elected chevalier in 1814 and commander in 1849. In 1815, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, in 1816 a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In addition, Biot received the Rumford Medal in 1840, awarded by the Royal Society in the field of thermal or optical properties of matter. (O‚ÄôConnor and Robertson 1997). In 1850 Jean-Baptiste Biot published in the Journal des savants a 7-page memoir from his recollections of the period of the late 1790s and early 1800s concerning his encounters with Laplace. Jean-Baptiste Biot had a single son, √âdouard Constant Biot, an engineer and Sinologist, born in 1803. Edouard died in 1850 and it was only thanks to the extraordinary efforts of his father that the second half of Edouard's last book, the Chinese classic Tcheou-li, was readied for publication. It had been left in manuscript, unfinished. To publish it in correct form, Jean-Baptiste Biot wrote, he had to consult Stanislas Julien, the famous Sinologist, but also, especially for the translation of the most difficult part, the Kaogongji, he himself had to visit many workshops and questioned artisans and craftsmen about their methods and vocabulary in order to verify his son's work. To this day, Biot's translation remains the only translation into a Western language of this book. He died in Paris on 3 February 1862.  Work  = Electromagnetism = Essai de g√©om√©trie analytique, 1826 Jean-Baptiste Biot made many contributions to the scientific community in his lifetime ‚Äì most notably in optics, magnetism, and astronomy. The Biot‚ÄìSavart law in magnetism is named after Biot and his colleague F√©lix Savart for their work in 1820.A joint Biot-Savart paper \\"Note sur le magn√©tisme de la pile de Volta\\" was published in the Annales de chemie et de physique in 1820. In their experiment they showed a connection between electricity and magnetism by \\"starting with a long vertical wire and a magnetic needle some horizontal distance apart [and showing] that running a current through the wire caused the needle to move\\" (Parsley). = Meteorites = In 1803 Biot was sent by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise to report back on 3000 meteorites that fell on L'Aigle, France (see L'Aigle (meteorite)). He found that the meteorites, called \\"stones\\" at the time, were from outer space.J.B. Biot (1803) Relation d'un voyage fait dans le d√©partement de l'Orne, pour constater la r√©alit√© d'un m√©t√©ore observ√© √† l'Aigle le 26 flor√©al an 11 [Account of a journey made in the department of the Orne [River], in order to ascertain the reality of a meteor observed in l'Aigle on the 26th of Flor√©al in the year 11 [Note: The date \\"26 flor√©al\\" on the title page is a typographical error; the meteor shower actually occurred on 6 flor√©al (i.e., April 26, 1803) and everywhere else in the text the date \\"6 flor√©al\\" is given as the date of the meteor shower. (Paris, France: Baudouin, 1803). With his report, Biot helped support Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni's argument that meteorites were debris from space, which he had published in 1794.Chladni, Ernst Florens Friedrich, √úber den Ursprung der von Pallas gefundenen und anderer ihr √§hnlicher Eisenmassen und √ºber einige damit in Verbindung stehende Naturerscheinungen [On the origin of the iron masses found by Pallas and others similar to it, and on some natural phenomena associated with them] (Riga, Latvia: Johann Friedrich Hartknoch, 1794). Available on-line at: Saxon State and University Library at Dresden, Germany.Biot in 1851 Prior to Biot's thorough investigation of the meteorites that fell near l'Aigle, France in 1803, very few truly believed that rocks found on Earth could have extraterrestrial origins. There were anecdotal tales of unusual rocks found on the ground after fireballs had been seen in the sky, but such stories were often dismissed as fantasy. Serious debate concerning the unusual rocks began in 1794 when German physicist Chladni published a book claiming that rocks had an extraterrestrial origin (Westrum). Only after Biot was able to analyze the rocks at l'Aigle was it commonly accepted that the fireballs seen in the sky were meteors falling through the atmosphere. Since Biot's time, analysis of meteorites has resulted in accurate measurements of the chemical composition of the solar system. The composition and position of meteors in the solar system have also given astronomers clues as to how the solar system formed. = Polarized light = In 1812, Biot turned his attention to the study of optics, particularly the polarization of light. Prior to the 19th century, light was believed to consist of discrete packets called corpuscles. During the early 19th century, many scientists began to disregard the corpuscular theory in favor of the wave theory of light. Biot began his work on polarization to show that the results he was obtaining could appear only if light were made of corpuscles. In 1815 he demonstrated that \\"polarized light, when passing through an organic substance, could be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, dependent upon the optical axis of the material.\\"Biot, J. B. (1815) \\"Phenomene de polarisation successive, observ√©s dans des fluides homogenes\\" (Phenomenon of successive polarization, observed in homogeneous fluids), Bulletin des Sciences, par la Soci√©t√© Philomatique de Paris, 190‚Äì192.Jean-Baptiste Biot - Florida State University His work in chromatic polarization and rotary polarization greatly advanced the field of optics, although it was later shown that his findings could also be obtained using the wave theory of light (Frankel 2009). Biot's work on the polarization of light has led to many breakthroughs in the field of optics. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs), such as television and computer screens, use light that is polarized by a filter as it enters the liquid crystal, to allow the liquid crystal to modulate the intensity of the transmitted light. This happens as the liquid crystal's polarisation varies in response to an electric control signal applied across it. Polarizing filters are used extensively in photography to cut out unwanted reflections or to enhance reflection. = Cream of Tartar = Potassium tartrate was first discovered inside a wine container in Iran. The modern application of the substance began in 1768, and in 1832, Jean Baptiste Biot discovered the physical properties of cream of tartar. The item gained most of its popularity when the French began using it frequently in their cooking.

Early life and family He was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland (now Northern Ireland). His parents were Scottish Protestants, John Eaton and Margaret Craig. As a 20-year-old Irish apprentice shopkeeper, Timothy Eaton sailed from Ireland to settle with other family members in southern Ontario, Canada. On 28 May 1862, Eaton married Margaret Wilson Beattie. They had five sons and three daughters. Among the sons were John Craig Eaton and Edward Young Eaton. One of the daughters, Josephine Smyth Eaton, survived the sinking of the RMS Lusitania off the Irish coast in 1915. His granddaughter, Iris Burnside, was lost in that sinking. T. Eaton Co. Limited Plaque about Eaton in Toronto statue of Eaton (photographed in 1919) sits in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto; a second casting sits in Bell MTS Place in Winnipeg In 1854, he worked for a short time in a haberdashery store in Glen Williams, Ontario. His sister married William Reid; they owned a farm in Georgetown, Ontario, a short distance from Glen Williams. In 1865, with the help of his brothers, Robert and James, Timothy Eaton set up a bakery business in the town of Kirkton, Ontario, which went under after only a few months. Undaunted, he opened a dry goods store in St. Marys, Ontario. In 1869, Eaton purchased an existing dry-goods and haberdashery business at 178 Yonge Street in Toronto. In promoting his new business, Eaton embraced two retail practices that were ground-breaking at the time: first, all goods had one price (no haggling) with no credit given, and second, all purchases came with a money-back guarantee (a practice expressed in what would become the long-standing store slogan of \\"Goods Satisfactory or Money Refunded\\"). Starting in 1884, Eaton introduced Canada to the wonders of the mail-order catalogue, reaching thousands of small towns and rural communities with an array of products previously unattainable. In these tiny communities, the arrival of Eaton's catalogue was a major event. More than clothing, furniture, or the latest in kitchen gadgetry, the catalogue offered such practical items as milking machines, in addition to just about every other contraption or new invention desirable. And, when rendered obsolete by the new season's catalogue, it served another important use in the outdoor privy of most every rural home. Eaton spawned a colossal retail empire that his offspring would expand coast to coast, reaching its high point during World War II, when the T. Eaton Co. Limited employed more than 70,000 people. Although Eaton did not invent the department store, nor was he the first retailer in the world to implement a money-back guarantee, the chain he founded popularized both concepts and revolutionized retailing in Canada. Death and legacy Eaton family's mausoleum in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto Eaton died of pneumonia on 31 January 1907, and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. He was succeeded by his son, John Craig Eaton. In 1919, two life-sized statues of Timothy Eaton were donated by the Eaton's employees to the Toronto and Winnipeg stores in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company. For years, it was tradition for customers in both Toronto and Winnipeg to rub the toe of the statue for good luck. The Toronto statue is now housed by the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Winnipeg statue sits in the city's new arena, Bell MTS Place (formerly the MTS Centre), in almost exactly the same spot where it stood in the now demolished Eaton's store (albeit one storey higher). Museum-goers in Toronto and hockey fans in Winnipeg continue to rub Timothy Eaton's toe for luck. His grandson was flying ace Henry John Burden. In 1985, his great-great granddaughter, Nancy Eaton, was murdered by a childhood friend, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Timothy Eaton Memorial Church, in Toronto, was erected in 1914. The town of Eatonia, Saskatchewan was named after Timothy Eaton. The ground of Ballymena RFC, originally the sports grounds of the Mid-Antrim Sports Association, is called Eaton Park. A school in Scarborough, Ontario, Timothy Eaton Business and Technical Institute, was named after him. It opened in 1971 for classes and closed its doors permanently in 2009.

A monoplane has inherently the highest efficiency and lowest drag of any wing configuration and is the simplest to build. However, during the early years of flight, these advantages were offset by its greater weight and lower manoeuvrability, making it relatively rare until the 1930s. Since then, the monoplane has been the most common form for a fixed-wing aircraft. Characteristics =Support and weight= The inherent efficiency of the monoplane is best achieved in the cantilever wing, which carries all structural forces internally. However to fly at practical speeds the wing must be made thin, which requires a heavy structure to make it strong and stiff enough. External bracing can be used to improve structural efficiency, reducing weight and cost. For a wing of a given size, the weight reduction allows it to fly slower and with a lower-powered and more economical engine. For this reason, all monoplane wings in the pioneer era were braced and most were up until the early 1930s. However the exposed struts or wires create additional drag, lowering aerodynamic efficiency and reducing the maximum speed. High-speed and long-range designs tend to be pure cantilevers, while low-speed short-range types are often given bracing.  Besides the general variations in wing configuration such as tail position and use of bracing, the main distinction between types of monoplane is where the wing is mounted vertically on the fuselage. =Low= Curtiss P-40 A low wing is one which is located on or near the bottom of the fuselage. Placing the wing low allows good visibility upwards and frees the central fuselage from the wing spar carry-through. By reducing pendulum stability, it makes the aircraft more manoeuvrable, as on the Spitfire; but aircraft that value stability over manoeuvrability may then need some dihedral. A feature of the low-wing position is its significant ground effect, giving the plane a tendency to float farther before landing. Conversely, this ground effect permits shorter takeoffs. =Mid= Mid wing on a de Havilland Vampire T11 A mid wing is mounted midway up the fuselage. The carry-through spar structure can reduce the useful fuselage volume near its centre of gravity, where space is often in most demand. =Shoulder= Shoulder wing on an ARV Super2, showing good pilot visibility A shoulder wing (a category between high-wing and mid-wing) is a configuration whereby the wing is mounted near the top of the fuselage but not on the very top. It is so called because it sits on the \\"shoulder\\" of the fuselage, rather than on the pilot's shoulder. Shoulder-wings and high-wings share some characteristics, namely: they support a pendulous fuselage which requires no wing dihedral for stability; and, by comparison with a low-wing, a shoulder-wing's limited ground effect reduces float on landing. Compared to a low-wing, shoulder-wing and high-wing configurations give increased propeller clearance on multi-engined aircraft. On a large aircraft, there is little practical difference between a shoulder wing and a high wing; but on light aircraft, the configuration is significant because it offers superior visibility to the pilot. On a light aircraft, the shoulder-wing may need to be swept forward to maintain correct center of gravity.Pilot magazine February 1986 page 32 Examples of light aircraft with shoulder wings include the ARV Super2, the B√∂lkow Junior, Saab Safari and the Barber Snark.  Dash 8 A high wing has its upper surface on or above the top of the fuselage. It shares many advantages and disadvantages with the shoulder wing, but on a light aircraft, the high wing has poorer upwards visibility. On light aircraft such as the Cessna 152, the wing is usually located above the cabin, so that the wing spar passes over the occupants heads, leaving the wing in the ideal fore- aft position.Trevor Thom ‚Äì The Aeroplane (Technical) ‚Äì 1997 page 65 An advantage of the high-wing configuration is that the fuselage is closer to the ground which eases cargo loading, especially for aircraft with a rear-fuselage cargo door. Military cargo aircraft are predominently high-wing designs with a rear cargo door. =Parasol= Parasol wing on a Pietenpol Air Camper A parasol wing is not directly attached to the fuselage but held above it, supported by either cabane struts or a pylon.Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 379. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. Additional bracing may be provided by struts or wires extending from the fuselage sides. The first parasol monoplanes were adaptations of shoulder wing monoplanes, since raising a shoulder mounted wing above the fuselage greatly improved visibility downwards, which was useful for reconnaissance roles, as with the widely used Morane-Saulnier L.Davilla, 1997, pp.60 & 315 The parasol wing allows for an efficient design with good pilot visibility, and was adopted for some fighters such as the Fokker D.VIII and Morane- Saulnier AI in the later part of the First World War.Angelucci and Matricardi, pp. 151, 290-1. A parasol wing also provides a high mounting point for engines and during the interwar period was popular on flying boats, which need to lift the propellers clear of spray. Examples include the Martin M-130, Dornier Do 18 and the Consolidated PBY Catalina. Compared to a biplane, a parasol wing has less bracing and lower drag. It remains a popular configuration for amphibians and small homebuilt and ultralight aircraft. History The Santos-Dumont Demoiselle was the first production monoplane (replica shown). Although the first successful aircraft were biplanes, the first attempts at heavier-than-air flying machines were monoplanes, and many pioneers continued to develop monoplane designs. For example, the first aeroplane to be put into production was the 1907 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, while the Bl√©riot XI flew across the English Channel in 1909.Wragg, David; Historical Dictionary of Aviation, History Press, 2008, pp.214-5. Throughout 1909‚Äì1910, Hubert Latham set multiple altitude records in his Antoinette IV monoplane, eventually reaching .King, Windkiller, p. 227. The Junkers J 1 monoplane pioneered all- metal construction in 1915. The equivalent German language term is Eindecker, as in the mid-wing Fokker Eindecker fighter of 1915 which for a time dominated the skies in what became known as the \\"Fokker scourge\\". The German military Idflieg aircraft designation system prior to 1918 prefixed monoplane type designations with an E, until the approval of the Fokker D.VIII fighter from its former \\"E.V\\" designation. However, the success of the Fokker was short- lived, and World War I was dominated by biplanes. Towards the end of the war, the parasol monoplane became popular and successful designs were produced into the 1920s.Angelucci and Matricardi, pp. 109-129. Nonetheless, relatively few monoplane types were built between 1914 and the late 1920s, compared with the number of biplanes. The reasons for this were primarily practical. With the low engine powers and airspeeds available, the wings of a monoplane needed to be large in order to create enough lift while a biplane could have two smaller wings and so be made smaller and lighter. Towards the end of the First World War, the inherent high drag of the biplane was beginning to restrict performance. Engines were not yet powerful enough to make the heavy cantilever-wing monoplane viable, and the braced parasol wing became popular on fighter aircraft, although few arrived in time to see combat. It remained popular throughout the 1920s. On flying boats with a shallow hull, a parasol wing allows the engines to be mounted above the spray from the water when taking off and landing. This arrangement was popular on flying boats during the 1930s; a late example being the Consolidated PBY Catalina. It died out when taller hulls became the norm during World War II, allowing a high wing to be attached directly to the hull. As ever-increasing engine powers made the weight of all-metal construction and the cantilever wing more practical ‚Äî both first pioneered together by the revolutionary German Junkers J 1 factory demonstrator in 1915‚Äì16 ‚Äî they became common during the post‚ÄìWorld War I period, the day of the braced wing passed, and by the 1930s, the cantilever monoplane was fast becoming the standard configuration for a fixed-wing aircraft. Advanced monoplane fighter-aircraft designs were mass-produced for military services around the world in both the Soviet Union and the United States in the early‚Äìmid 1930s, with the Polikarpov I-16 and the Boeing P-26 Peashooter respectively. Most military aircraft of WWII were monoplanes, as have been virtually all aircraft since, except for a few specialist types. Jet and rocket engines have even more power and all modern high-speed aircraft, especially supersonic types, have been monoplanes.

According to Jewish tradition, Jeremiah authored the Book of Jeremiah, the Books of Kings and the Book of Lamentations, with the assistance and under the editorship of Baruch ben Neriah, his scribe and disciple. In addition to proclaiming many prophecies of the God of Israel, the Book of Jeremiah goes into detail regarding the prophet's private life (e.g., the purchase of a field belonging to his uncle as a part of the right of redemption) and his experiences (e.g., imprisonment), which are thus better known than those of any other prophet. Judaism considers the Book of Jeremiah part of its canon, and regards Jeremiah as the second of the major prophets. Christianity and Islam also regard Jeremiah as a prophet. His words are quoted in the New Testament and his narrative is recounted in Islamic tradition.  Chronology  Jeremiah by Enrico Glicenstein Jeremiah's ministry was active from the thirteenth year of Josiah, king of Judah (626 BC), until after the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon's Temple in 587 BC. This period spanned the reigns of five kings of Judah: Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah.  Biblical narrative  = Lineage and early life = Jeremiah was the son of Hilkiah, a kohen (Jewish priest) from the Benjamite village of Anathoth. The difficulties he encountered, as described in the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations, have prompted scholars to refer to him as \\"the weeping prophet\\". Jeremiah was called to prophetic ministry c. 626 BC by YHWH to give prophecy of Jerusalem's coming destruction by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had forsaken God by worshiping the idols of Baal and burning their children as offerings to Moloch. The nation had deviated so far from God's laws that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would suffer famine, foreign conquest, plunder, and captivity in a land of strangers. The prophetess Huldah was a relative and contemporary of Jeremiah while the prophet Zephaniah was his mentor. = Calling = Horace Vernet, Jeremiah on the ruins of Jerusalem (1844) According to Jeremiah 1:2‚Äì3, Yahweh called Jeremiah to prophetic ministry in about 626 BC, about five years before Josiah king of Judah turned the nation toward repentance from idolatrous practices. According to the Books of Kings and Jeremiah, Josiah's reforms were insufficient to save Judah and Jerusalem from destruction, because of the sins of Manasseh, Josiah's grandfather, and Judah's lustful return to the idolatry of foreign gods after Josiah's death. Jeremiah was said to have been appointed to reveal the sins of the people and the punishment to come. Jeremiah resisted the call by complaining that he was only a child and did not know how to speak, but the Lord placed the word in Jeremiah's mouth, commanding \\"Get yourself ready!\\" The qualities of a prophet listed in Jeremiah 1 include not being afraid, standing up to speak, speaking as told, and going where sent. Since Jeremiah is described as emerging well trained and fully literate from his earliest preaching, his relationship with the Shaphan family has been used to suggest that he may have trained at the scribal school in Jerusalem over which Shaphan presided. In his early ministry, Jeremiah was primarily a preaching prophet, preaching throughout Israel. He condemned idolatry,, the greed of priests, and false prophets.. Many years later, God instructed Jeremiah to write down these early oracles and his other messages. = Persecution = Rembrandt van Rijn, Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem, c. 1630 Jeremiah's ministry prompted plots against him. Unhappy with Jeremiah's message, possibly from concern that it would shut down the Anathoth sanctuary, his priestly kin and the men of Anathoth conspired to kill him. However, the Lord revealed the conspiracy to Jeremiah, protected his life, and declared disaster for the men of Anathoth. When Jeremiah complains to the Lord about this persecution, he is told that the attacks on him will become worse. A priest, Pashur the son of ben Immer, a temple official in Jerusalem, had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin for a day. After this, Jeremiah laments the travails and mockery that speaking God's word have caused him. He recounts how if he tries to shut God's word inside, it burns in his heart and he is unable to hold it in. = Conflicts with false prophets = While Jeremiah was prophesying the coming destruction, he denounced a number of other prophets who were prophesying peace. According to the book of Jeremiah, during the reign of King Zedekiah, The Lord instructed Jeremiah to make a yoke with the message that the nation would be subject to the king of Babylon. The prophet Hananiah took the yoke off Jeremiah's neck and broke it, prophesying that within two years the Lord would break the yoke of the king of Babylon, but Jeremiah prophesied in return: \\"You have broken the yoke of wood, but you have made instead a yoke of iron.\\" = Relationship with the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) = Jeremiah was sympathetic to, as well as descended from, the Northern Kingdom. Many of his first reported oracles are about, and addressed to, the Israelites at Samaria. He resembles the northern prophet Hosea in his use of language and examples of God's relationship to Israel. Hosea seems to have been the first prophet to describe the desired relationship as an example of ancient Israelite marriage, where a man might be polygynous, while a woman was only permitted one husband. Jeremiah often repeats Hosea's marital imagery. = Babylon = The Biblical narrative portrays Jeremiah as being subject to additional persecutions. After Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem would be handed over to the Babylonian army, the king's officials, including Pashur the priest, tried to convince King Zedekiah that Jeremiah should be put to death for disheartening the soldiers and the people. Zedekiah allowed them, and they cast Jeremiah into a cistern, where he sank down into the mud. The intent seemed to be to kill Jeremiah by starvation, while allowing the officials to claim to be innocent of his blood. A Cushite rescued Jeremiah by pulling him out of the cistern, but Jeremiah remained imprisoned until Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian army in 587 BC. The Babylonians released Jeremiah, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence, according to a Babylonian edict. Jeremiah accordingly went to Mizpah in Benjamin with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. = Egypt = Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, who had been assassinated by an Israelite prince in the pay of Ammon \\"for working with the Babylonians.\\" Refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsel, Johanan fled to Egypt, taking with him Jeremiah and Baruch, Jeremiah's faithful scribe and servant, and the king's daughters. There, the prophet probably spent the remainder of his life, still seeking in vain to turn the people back to God. There is no authentic record of his death.  Religious views  = Judaism = In Jewish rabbinic literature, especially the aggadah, Jeremiah and Moses are often mentioned together;This article incorporates text from the 1901‚Äì1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, a publication now in the public domain. their life and works being presented in parallel lines. The following ancient midrash is especially interesting, in connection with , in which \\"a prophet like Moses\\" is promised: \\"As Moses was a prophet for forty years, so was Jeremiah; as Moses prophesied concerning Judah and Benjamin, so did Jeremiah; as Moses' own tribe [the Levites under Korah] rose up against him, so did Jeremiah's tribe revolt against him; Moses was cast into the water, Jeremiah into a pit; as Moses was saved by a slave (the slave of Pharaoh's daughter); so, Jeremiah was rescued by a slave (Ebed-melech); Moses reprimanded the people in discourses; so did Jeremiah.\\"Pesiqta, ed. Buber, xiii. 112a. The prophet Ezekiel was a son of Jeremiah according to rabbinic literature. In 2 Maccabees 2:4ff the subject is credited with hiding the Ark, incense altar, and tabernacle on the mountain of Moses. = Christianity = The Book of Jeremiah plays a foundational role in Christian thought as it presages the inauguration of a new covenant, to which the New Testament testifies. There are about forty direct quotations of the book in the New Testament, most in Revelation in connection with the destruction of Babylon. * in * in ; * in Of the Gospel writers, Matthew is especially mindful of how the events in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus fulfill Jeremianic prophecies. The letter to the Hebrews also picks up the fulfilment of the prophetic expectation of the new covenant.) = Islam = Jeremiah in the wilderness (top left); Jonah and the fish; Uzeyr awakened after the destruction of Jerusalem. Ottoman Turkish miniature, 16th century. As with many other prophets of the Hebrew Bible, Jeremiah is also regarded as a prophet in Islam. Although Jeremiah is not mentioned in the Quran, Muslim exegesis and literature narrates many instances from the life of Jeremiah and fleshes out his narrative, which closely corresponds with the account given in the Hebrew Bible. In Arabic, Jeremiah's name is usually vocalised IrmiyƒÅ, ArmiyƒÅ or ≈™rmiyƒÅ,.see TƒÅdÃ≤jÃ≤ al- øAr≈´s, x. 157. Classical historians such as Wahb ibn Munabbih gave accounts of Jeremiah which turned \\"upon the main points of the Old Testament story of Jeremiah: his call to be a prophet, his mission to the king of Judah, his mission to the people and his reluctance, the announcement of a foreign tyrant who is to rule over Judah.\\" Moreover, some hadiths and tafsirs narrate that the Parable of the Hamlet in Ruins is about Jeremiah.Tafsir al-Qurtubi, vol. 3, p. 188; Tafsir al-Qummi, vol. 1, p. 117. Also, in Sura 17(Al-Isra), Ayah 4‚Äì7, that is about the two corruptions of children of Israel on the earth, some hadith and tafsir cite that one of these corruptions is the imprisonment and persecution of Jeremiah. Muslim literature narrates a detailed account of the destruction of Jerusalem, which parallels the account given in the Book of Jeremiah.Tabari, i, 646ff.  Historicity  The consensus is that there was a historical prophet named Jeremiah and that portions of the book probably were written by Jeremiah and/or his scribe Baruch. Views range from the belief that the narratives and poetic sections in Jeremiah are contemporary with his life (W.L. Holladay), to the view that the work of the original prophet is beyond identification or recovery (R. P. Carroll). See the extensive analysis in First there were early collections of oracles, including material in ch. 2-6, 8-10, 13, 21-23, etc. Then there was an early Deuteronomistic redaction which Albertz dates to around 550 BC, with the original ending to the book at 25:13. There was a second redaction around 545-540 BC which added much more material, up to about ch. 45. Then there was a third redaction around 525‚Äì520 BC, expanding the book up to the ending at 51:64. Then there were further post-exilic redactions adding ch. 52 and editing content throughout the book. Although Jeremiah was often thought of traditionally as the author of the Book of Lamentations, this is probably a collection of individual and communal laments composed at various times throughout the Babylonian captivity. Albertz considers ch. 2 as the oldest, dating shortly after the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC) and ch. 5 after the assassination of Gedaliah, with the other chapters added later (p. 160).  Archaeology  = Nebo-Sarsekim tablet = In July 2007, Assyrologist Michael Jursa translated a cuneiform tablet dated to 595 BC, as describing a Nabusharrussu-ukin as \\"the chief eunuch\\" of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. Jursa hypothesized that this reference might be to the same individual as the Nebo-Sarsekim mentioned in . = Seals = A 7th-century BCE seal of Jehucal, son of Shelemiah and another of Gedaliah, son of Pashhur (mentioned together in Jeremiah 38:1; Jehucal also mentioned in Jeremiah 37:3) were found during excavation by Eilat Mazar in the city of David, Jerusalem, in 2005 and 2008, respectively. = Tel Arad ostraca = Pottery shards at Tel Arad were unearthed in the 1970s that mention Pashhur, and this reference may be the same individual mentioned in  Cultural influence  Jeremiah inspired the French noun j√©r√©miade, and subsequently the English jeremiad, meaning \\"a lamentation; mournful complaint,\\" or further, \\"a cautionary or angry harangue.\\" Jeremiah has periodically been a popular first name in the United States, beginning with the early Puritan settlers, who often took the names of biblical prophets and apostles. Jeremiah was substituted for the Irish Diarmuid/Diarmaid (also anglicised as Dermot), with which it has no etymological connection, when Gaelic names were frowned upon in official records. The name Jeremy also derives from Jeremiah.  References  = Notes = = Citations = = Works cited =            *  Further reading    Friedman, Richard E. (1987). Who Wrote the Bible?

A distinguished politician during the reign of Philip the Arab, Decius was proclaimed emperor by his troops after putting down a rebellion in Moesia. In 249, he defeated and killed Philip near Verona and was recognized as emperor by the Senate afterwards. During his reign, he attempted to strengthen the Roman state and its religion, leading to the Decian persecution, where a number of prominent Christians (including Pope Fabian) were put to death. In the last year of his reign, Decius co-ruled with his son Herennius Etruscus, until they were both killed by the Goths in the Battle of Abritus. Early life and rise to power Antoninianus of Trajan Decius. Inscription: IMP. C. M. Q. TRAIANVS DECIVS AVG. Decius, who was born at Budalia,Handbook to life in ancient Rome, By Lesley Adkins, Roy A. Adkins, 2004, p. 28 near Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior (now Martinci and Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia), was one of the first among a long succession of future Roman Emperors to originate from the Danube provinces, often simply called Illyricum.\\"These men are usually called the Illyrian emperors since they all were born in that province (Illyricum) and were raised to power by legions stationed there\\". Joseph Ward Swain, The Ancient World Unlike some of his immediate imperial predecessors such as Philip the Arab or Maximinus who did not have extensive administrative experience before assuming the throne, Decius was a distinguished senator who had served as suffect consul in 232, had been governor of Moesia and Germania Inferior soon afterwards, served as governor of Hispania Tarraconensis between 235‚Äì238, and was urban prefect of Rome during the early reign of Emperor Philip the Arab (Marcus Iulius Phillippus).Scarre 1995, p.169 Around 245, Philip entrusted Decius with an important command on the Danube. By the end of 248 or 249, Decius was sent to quell the revolt of Pacatianus and his troops in Moesia and Pannonia; some modern historians see this rebellion as a reflection of emerging Balkan separatism.Potter 2004, pp.634‚Äì5 (note 106) After the collapse of the revolt, Decius let the troops proclaim him Emperor. Philip advanced against him and was killed at Verona, Italy, in September 249.Potter 2004, pp.240‚Äì241 The Senate then recognized Decius as Emperor, giving him the attribute Traianus in reference to the emperor Trajan. According to the Byzantine historian Zosimus, Decius was clothed in purple and forced to undertake the [burdens of] government, despite his reluctance and unwillingness.Zosimus, New History I.22 Political and monumental initiatives Decius' political program was focused on the restoration of the strength of the State, both militarily opposing the external threats, and restoring the public piety with a program of renovation of the State religion. =Reviving the censorship= Either as a concession to the Senate, or perhaps with the idea of improving public morality, Decius endeavoured to revive the separate office and authority of the censor. The choice was left to the Senate, who unanimously selected Valerian (the future emperor). But Valerian, well aware of the dangers and difficulties attached to the office at such a time, declined the responsibility. The invasion of the Goths and Decius' death put an end to the abortive attempt. =The Baths of Decius= During his reign, he proceeded with several building projects in Rome, \\"including the Thermae Decianae or Baths of Decius on the Aventine\\", which was completed in 252 and survived through to the 16th century; Decius also repaired the Colosseum, which had been damaged by lightning strikes.Scarre 1995, p.169 Persecution of Christians Byzantine fresco of Saint Mercurius (a Christian victim of the Decian persecution), dated 1295, from Ohrid, North Macedonia In January 250, Decius is said to have issued one of the most remarkable Roman imperial edicts. From the numerous surviving texts from Egypt, recording the act of sacrifice, it appears that the edict itself was fairly clear:Potter 2004, p.241 According to D. S. Potter, Decius did not try to impose the superiority of the Roman pantheon over any other gods. It is very probable that the edict was an attempt to legitimize his position and to respond to a general unease provoked by the passing of the Roman millennium.Potter 2004, p.243 While Decius himself may have intended the edict as a way to reaffirm his conservative vision of the Pax Romana and to reassure Rome's citizens that the empire was still secure, it nevertheless sparked a \\"terrible crisis of authority as various Christian bishops and their flocks reacted to it in different ways.\\" Measures were first taken demanding that the bishops and officers of the church make a sacrifice for the Emperor. The sacrifice was \\"on behalf of\\" (Latin pro) the Emperor, not to the Emperor, since a living Emperor was not considered divine. Certificates were issued to those who satisfied the commissioners during the persecution of Christians under Decius. Forty-six such certificates have been published, all dating from 250, four of them from Oxyrhynchus.Ancient History Sourcebook Anyone, including Christian followers, who refused to offer a sacrifice for the Emperor and the Empire's well-being by a specified date risked torture and execution.Scarre 1995, p.170 A number of prominent Christians did, in fact, refuse to make a sacrifice and were killed in the process, including Pope Fabian himself in 250, and \\"anti- Christian feeling[s] led to killings at Carthage and Alexandria.\\" In reality, however, towards the end of the second year of Decius' reign, \\"the ferocity of the [anti-Christian] persecution had eased off, and the earlier tradition of tolerance had begun to reassert itself.\\" Despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any particular group, Christians bore the brunt of the persecution and never forgot the reign of Decius; whom they remembered as \\"that fierce tyrant\\". At this time, there was a second outbreak of the Antonine Plague, which at its height from 251 to 266, took the lives of 5,000 daily in Rome. This outbreak is referred to as the \\"Plague of Cyprian\\" (Cyprian was the bishop of Carthage, where both the plague and the persecution of Christians were especially severe). Cyprian's biographer Pontius gave a vivid picture of the demoralizing effects of the plague and Cyprian moralized the event in his essay De mortalitate. In Carthage, the \\"Decian persecution\\", unleashed at the onset of the plague, sought out Christian scapegoats. Decius' edicts were renewed under Valerian in 253 and repealed under his son, Gallienus, in 260‚Äì261. Fighting the Goths and death The Gothic Invasions of 250‚Äì251 AD =The Goths enter the Balkans= The barbarian incursions into the Empire were becoming more and more daring and frequent whereas the Empire was facing a serious economic crisis in Decius' time. During his brief reign, Decius engaged in important operations against the Goths, who crossed the Danube to raid districts of Moesia and Thrace. This is the first considerable occasion that the Goths who would later come to play such an important role appear in the historical record. The Goths under King Cniva were surprised by the emperor while besieging Nicopolis on the Danube; the Goths fled through the difficult terrain of the Balkans, but then doubled back and surprised the Romans near Bero√´ (modern Stara Zagora), sacking their camp and dispersing the Roman troops. The Goths then moved to attack Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), which fell into their hands. The governor of Thrace, Titus Julius Priscus, declared himself Emperor under Gothic protection in opposition to Decius but Priscus's challenge was rendered moot when he was killed soon afterwards.Scarre 1995, p.169 Then the invaders began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.Wolfram 1988, p.46 =Battle of Abritus= Coin of Herennius Etruscus. Inscription: HER. ETR. MES. DECIVS NOB. C. / CONCORDIA AVG. F portrait of a weary Decius In the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general Trebonianus Gallus, intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty. The final engagement, the battle of Abritus, in which the Goths fought with the courage of despair, under the command of Cniva, took place during the second week of June 251 on swampy ground in the Ludogorie (region in northeastern Bulgaria which merges with Dobruja plateau and the Danube Plain to the north) near the small settlement of Abritus or Forum Terebronii (modern Razgrad). Jordanes records that Decius' son Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow early in the battle, and to cheer his men Decius exclaimed, \\"Let no one mourn; the death of one soldier is not a great loss to the republic.\\" Nevertheless, Decius' army was entangled in the swamp and annihilated in this battle, while he himself was killed on the field of battle. As the historian Aurelius Victor relates: One literary tradition claims that Decius was betrayed by his successor, Trebonianus Gallus, who was involved in a secret alliance with the Goths, but this cannot be substantiated and was most likely a later invention since Gallus felt compelled to adopt Decius' younger son, Gaius Valens Hostilianus, as joint emperor even though the latter was too young to rule in his own right.Scarre 1995, pp.168‚Äì169Southern 2001, p.308 It is also unlikely that the shattered Roman legions would proclaim as emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks.Potter 2004, p.247 Decius was the first Roman Emperor to die in battle against a foreign enemy.

Seneca. also known as Seneca the Younger, was a Hispano-Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and‚Äîin one work‚Äîsatirist from the Silver Age of Latin literature. Seneca was born in Cordoba in Hispania, and raised in Rome, where he was trained in rhetoric and philosophy. His father was Seneca the Elder, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan. In AD 41, Seneca was exiled to the island of Corsica under emperor Claudius, but was allowed to return in 49 to become a tutor to Nero. When Nero became emperor in 54, Seneca became his advisor and, together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, provided competent government for the first five years of Nero's reign. Seneca's influence over Nero declined with time, and in 65 Seneca was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero, in which he was likely to have been innocent. His stoic and calm suicide has become the subject of numerous paintings. As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays, which are all tragedies. His prose works include a dozen essays and one hundred twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues. These writings constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for ancient Stoicism. As a tragedian, he is best known for plays such as his Medea, Thyestes, and Phaedra. Seneca's influence on later generations is immense‚Äîduring the Renaissance he was \\"a sage admired and venerated as an oracle of moral, even of Christian edification; a master of literary style and a model [for] dramatic art.\\" Life =Early life, family and adulthood= Seneca was born in Corduba in the Roman province of Baetica in Hispania. His father was Lucius Annaeus Seneca the elder, a Spanish-born Roman knight who had gained fame as a writer and teacher of rhetoric in Rome. Seneca's mother, Helvia, was from a prominent Baetician family. Seneca was the second of three brothers; the others were Lucius Annaeus Novatus (later known as Junius Gallio), and Annaeus Mela, the father of the poet Lucan. Miriam Griffin says in her biography of Seneca that \\"the evidence for Seneca's life before his exile in 41 is so slight, and the potential interest of these years, for social history as well as for biography, is so great that few writers on Seneca have resisted the temptation to eke out knowledge with imagination.\\"Miriam T. Griffin. Seneca: A Philosopher in Politics, Oxford 1976. 34. Griffin also infers from the ancient sources that Seneca was born in either 8, 4, or 1 BC. She thinks he was born between 4 and 1 BC and was resident in Rome by AD 5. Modern statue of Seneca in C√≥rdoba Seneca tells us that he was taken to Rome in the \\"arms\\" of his aunt (his mother's stepsister) at a young age, probably when he was about five years old. citing De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem 19.2 His father resided for much of his life in the city. Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of high-born Romans. While still young he received philosophical training from Attalus the Stoic, and from Sotion and Papirius Fabianus, both of whom belonged to the short-lived School of the Sextii, which combined Stoicism with Pythagoreanism. Sotion persuaded Seneca when he was a young man (in his early twenties) to become a vegetarian, which he practised for around a year before his father urged him to desist because the practice was associated with \\"some foreign rites\\". Seneca often had breathing difficulties throughout his life, probably asthma, and at some point in his mid-twenties (c. 20 AD) he appears to have been struck down with tuberculosis. He was sent to Egypt to live with his aunt (the same aunt who had brought him to Rome), whose husband Gaius Galerius had become Prefect of Egypt. She nursed him through a period of ill-health that lasted up to ten years. In 31 AD he returned to Rome with his aunt, his uncle dying en route in a shipwreck. His aunt's influence helped Seneca be elected quaestor (probably after 37 AD), which also earned him the right to sit in the Roman Senate. =Politics and exile= Seneca's early career as a senator seems to have been successful and he was praised for his oratory. Cassius Dio relates a story that Caligula was so offended by Seneca's oratorical success in the Senate that he ordered him to commit suicide. Seneca only survived because he was seriously ill and Caligula was told that he would soon die anyway. In his writings Seneca has nothing good to say about Caligula and frequently depicts him as a monster. Seneca explains his own survival as down to his patience and his devotion to his friends: \\"I wanted to avoid the impression that all I could do for loyalty was die.\\" citing Naturales Quaestiones, 4.17 In 41 AD, Claudius became emperor, and Seneca was accused by the new empress Messalina of adultery with Julia Livilla, sister to Caligula and Agrippina. The affair has been doubted by some historians, since Messalina had clear political motives for getting rid of Julia Livilla and her supporters. The Senate pronounced a death sentence on Seneca, which Claudius commuted to exile, and Seneca spent the next eight years on the island of Corsica. Two of Seneca's earliest surviving works date from the period of his exileboth consolations. In his Consolation to Helvia, his mother, Seneca comforts her as a bereaved mother for losing her son to exile. Seneca incidentally mentions the death of his only son, a few weeks before his exile. Later in life Seneca was married to a woman younger than himself, Pompeia Paulina. It has been thought that the infant son may have been from an earlier marriage, but the evidence is \\"tenuous\\". Seneca's other work of this period, his Consolation to Polybius, one of Claudius' freedmen, focused on consoling Polybius on the death of his brother. It is noted for its flattery of Claudius, and Seneca expresses his hope that the emperor will recall him from exile. In 49 AD Agrippina married her uncle Claudius, and through her influence Seneca was recalled to Rome. Agrippina gained the praetorship for Seneca and appointed him tutor to her son, the future emperor Nero. =Imperial advisor= Eduardo Barr√≥n (1904). Museo del Prado From AD 54 to 62, Seneca acted as Nero's advisor, together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus. One byproduct of his new position was that Seneca was appointed suffect consul in 56.The Senatus Consultum Trebellianum was dated to 25 August in his consulate, which he shared with Trebellius Maximus. Digest 36.1.1 Seneca's influence was said to have been especially strong in the first year.Cassius Dio claims Seneca and Burrus \\"took the rule entirely into their own hands,\\" but \\"after the death of Britannicus, Seneca and Burrus no longer gave any careful attention to the public business\\" in 55 (Cassius Dio, Roman History, LXI.3‚Äì7) Seneca composed Nero's accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate. He also composed the eulogy for Claudius that Nero delivered at the funeral. Seneca's satirical skit Apocolocyntosis, which lampoons the deification of Claudius and praises Nero dates from the earliest period of Nero's reign. In 55 AD, Seneca wrote On Clemency following Nero's murder of Britannicus, perhaps to assure the citizenry that the murder was the end, not the beginning of bloodshed. On Clemency is a work which, although it flatters Nero, was intended to show the correct (Stoic) path of virtue for a ruler. Tacitus and Dio suggest that Nero's early rule, during which he listened to Seneca and Burrus, was quite competent. However, the ancient sources suggest that, over time, Seneca and Burrus lost their influence over the emperor. In 59 they had reluctantly agreed to Agrippina's murder, and afterward Tacitus reports that Seneca had to write a letter justifying the murder to the Senate. In 58 AD the senator Publius Suillius Rufus made a series of public attacks on Seneca. These attacks, reported by Tacitus and Cassius Dio,Tacitus, Annuals xiii.42; Cassius Dio, Roman History lxi.33.9. included charges that, in a mere four years of service to Nero, Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million sestertii by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces. Suillius' attacks included claims of sexual corruption, with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina. Tacitus, though, reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced: he had been a favourite of Claudius, and had been an embezzler and informant. In response, Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius: half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile. However, the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca that was made at the time and continued through later ages. Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich: he had properties at Baiae and Nomentum, an Alban villa, and Egyptian estates. Cassius Dio even reports that the Boudica uprising in Britannia was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius's conquest of Britain, and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively. Seneca was sensitive to such accusations: his De Vita Beata (\\"On the Happy Life\\") dates from around this time and includes a defense of wealth along Stoic lines, arguing that properly gaining and spending wealth is appropriate behaviour for a philosopher. =Retirement= After Burrus's death in 62, Seneca's influence declined rapidly; as Tacitus puts it (Ann. 14.52.1), mors Burri infregit Senecae potentiam (\\"the death of Burrus broke Seneca's power\\"). Tacitus reports that Seneca tried to retire twice, in 62 and 64 AD, but Nero refused him on both occasions. Nevertheless, Seneca was increasingly absent from the court. He adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates, concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome. It was during these final few years that he composed two of his greatest works: Naturales quaestionesan encyclopedia of the natural world; and his Letters to Luciliuswhich document his philosophical thoughts. =Death= Manuel Dom√≠nguez S√°nchez, The suicide of Seneca (1871), Museo del Prado Lodovico Lana, Death of Seneca, National Gallery of Art In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself. Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. Cassius Dio, who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero, focused on how Seneca had attended to his last-minute letters, and how his death was hastened by soldiers. citing Cassius Dio ii.25 A generation after the Julio-Claudian emperors, Tacitus wrote an account of the suicide, which, in view of his Republican sympathies, is perhaps somewhat romanticized. citing Tacitus Annals, xv. 60‚Äì64 According to this account, Nero ordered Seneca's wife saved. Her wounds were bound up and she made no further attempt to kill herself. As for Seneca himself, his age and diet were blamed for slow loss of blood and extended pain rather than a quick death. He also took poison, which was however not fatal. After dictating his last words to a scribe, and with a circle of friends attending him in his home, he immersed himself in a warm bath, which he expected would speed blood flow and ease his pain. Tacitus wrote, \\"He was then carried into a bath, with the steam of which he was suffocated, and he was burnt without any of the usual funeral rites. So he had directed in a codicil of his will, even when in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of life's close.\\" This may give the impression of a favourable portrait of Seneca, but Tacitus' treatment of him is at best ambivalent. Alongside Seneca's apparent fortitude in the face of death, for example, one can also view his actions as rather histrionic and performative; and when Tacitus tells us that he left his family an imago suae vitae (Annales 15.62), \\"an image of his life\\", he is possibly being ambiguous: in Roman culture, the imago was a kind of mask that commemorated the great ancestors of noble families, but at the same time, it may also suggest duplicity, superficiality, and pretence.Cf. especially Beard, M., \\"How Stoical was Seneca?\\", in the New York Review of Books, Oct. 9th, 2014. Philosophy First page of the Naturales Quaestiones, made for the Catalan-Aragonese court As \\"a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period\\", Seneca‚Äôs lasting contribution to philosophy has been to the school of Stoicism. His writing is highly accessible and was the subject of attention from the Renaissance onwards by writers such as Michel de Montaigne. He has been described as ‚Äúa towering and controversial figure of antiquity‚Äù and ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most interesting Stoic‚Äù. Seneca wrote a number of books on Stoicism, mostly on ethics, with one work (Naturales Quaestiones) on the physical world. Seneca built on the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; and frequently cites Posidonius, with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena. He frequently quotes Epicurus, especially in his Letters. His interest in Epicurus is mainly limited to using him as a source of ethical maxims. Likewise Seneca shows some interest in Platonist metaphysics, but never with any clear commitment. His moral essays are based on Stoic doctrines. A quote from his Moral Epistles (48.2; Alteri vivas oportet si vis tibi vivere (\\"One must live for another, if he wishes to live for himself\\")) is inscribed on the back of the Waldo Hutchins bench (1932) in Central Park, Manhattan, New York City. Stoicism was a popular philosophy in this period, and many upper-class Romans found in it a guiding ethical framework for political involvement. It was once popular to regard Seneca as being very eclectic in his Stoicism,\\"His philosophy, so far as he adopted a system, was the stoical, but it was rather an eclecticism of stoicism than pure stoicism\\" but modern scholarship views him as a fairly orthodox Stoic, albeit a free-minded one. His works discuss both ethical theory and practical advice, and Seneca stresses that both parts are distinct but interdependent. His Letters to Lucilius showcase Seneca's search for ethical perfection and ‚Äúrepresent a sort of philosophical testament for posterity‚Äù. Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life. The destructive passions, especially anger and grief, must be uprooted, or moderated according to reason. He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life, and he considers it important to confront one's own mortality and be able to face death. One must be willing to practice poverty and use wealth properly, and he writes about favours, clemency, the importance of friendship, and the need to benefit others. The universe is governed for the best by a rational providence, and this must be reconciled with acceptance of adversity. Drama Woodcut illustration of the suicide of Seneca and the attempted suicide of his wife Pompeia Paulina Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him. The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca's Stoic beliefs. Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness, ruination, and self- destruction. This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force. Many scholars have thought, following the ideas of the 19th-century German scholar Friedrich Leo, that Seneca's tragedies were written for recitation only. Other scholars think that they were written for performance and that it is possible that actual performance had taken place in Seneca's lifetime.George W.M. Harrison (ed.), Seneca in performance, London: Duckworth, 2000. Ultimately, this issue cannot be resolved on the basis of our existing knowledge. The tragedies of Seneca have been successfully staged in modern times. The dating of the tragedies is highly problematic in the absence of any ancient references. A parody of a lament from Hercules Furens appears in the Apocolocyntosis, which implies a date before 54 AD for that play. A relative chronology has been suggested on metrical grounds but scholars remain divided. The plays are not all based on the Greek pattern; they have a five-act form and differ in many respects from extant Attic drama, and while the influence of Euripides on some of these works is considerable, so is the influence of Virgil and Ovid. Seneca's plays were widely read in medieval and Renaissance European universities and strongly influenced tragic drama in that time, such as Elizabethan England (William Shakespeare and other playwrights), France (Corneille and Racine), and the Netherlands (Joost van den Vondel). English translations of Seneca's tragedies appeared in print in the mid-16th century, with all ten published collectively in 1581.Seneca, Lucius Annaeus. His Tenne Tragedies. Thomas Newton, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1966, p. xlv. He is regarded as the source and inspiration for what is known as \\"Revenge Tragedy\\", starting with Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and continuing well into the Jacobean era. Thyestes is considered Seneca's masterpiece, and has been described by scholar Dana Gioia as \\"one of the most influential plays ever written\\". Medea is also highly regarded, \\"Medea is often considered the masterpiece of Seneca's earlier plays, [...]\\" and was praised along with Phaedra by T. S. Eliot. Works Works attributed to Seneca include a dozen philosophical essays, one hundred and twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues, nine tragedies, and a satire, the attribution of which is disputed.Brockett, O. (2003), History of the Theatre: Ninth Ed. Allyn and Bacon. p. 50 His authorship of Hercules on Oeta has also been questioned. =Seneca's tragedies= Fabulae crepidatae (tragedies with Greek subjects): * Hercules or Hercules furens (The Madness of Hercules) * Troades (The Trojan Women) * Phoenissae (The Phoenician Women) * Medea * Phaedra * Oedipus * Agamemnon * Thyestes * Hercules Oetaeus (Hercules on Oeta): generally considered not written by Seneca.

Cujus etiam ad Paulum apostolum leguntur epistolae: These letters, allegedly between Seneca and St Paul, were revered by early authorities, but modern scholarship rejects their authenticity.Joseph Barber Lightfoot (1892) St Paul and Seneca Dissertations on the Apostolic Age =\\"Pseudo-Seneca\\"= Various antique and medieval texts purport to be by Seneca, e.g., De remediis fortuitorum. Their unknown authors are collectively called Pseudo-Seneca. At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content, for example, Saint Martin of Braga's (d. c. 580) Formula vitae honestae, or De differentiis quatuor virtutumvitae honestae (\\"Rules for an Honest Life\\", or \\"On the Four Cardinal Virtues\\"). Early manuscripts preserve Martin's preface, where he makes it clear that this was his adaptation, but in later copies this was omitted, and the work was later thought fully Seneca's work.Istv√°n Pieter Bejczy, The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century, BRILL, 2011, pp. 55-5 7. Legacy =As a proto-Christian saint= Plato, Seneca, and Aristotle in a medieval manuscript illustration (c. 1325‚Äì35) Seneca's writings were well known in the later Roman period, and Quintilian, writing thirty years after Seneca's death, remarked on the popularity of his works amongst the youth. While he found much to admire, Quintillian criticised Seneca for what he regarded as a degenerate literary stylea criticism echoed by Aulus Gellius in the middle of the 2nd century. citing Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria, x.1.126f; Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, xii. 2. The early Christian Church was very favorably disposed towards Seneca and his writings, and the church leader Tertullian possessively referred to him as \\"our Seneca\\".Moses Hadas. The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca, 1958. 1. By the 4th century an apocryphal correspondence with Paul the Apostle had been created linking Seneca into the Christian tradition. The letters are mentioned by Jerome who also included Seneca among a list of Christian writers, and Seneca is similarly mentioned by Augustine. In the 6th century Martin of Braga synthesised Seneca's thought into a couple of treatises that became popular in their own right. Otherwise, Seneca was mainly known through a large number of quotes and extracts in the florilegia, which were popular throughout the medieval period. When his writings were read in the later Middle Ages, it was mostly his Letters to Lucilius‚Äîthe longer essays and plays being relatively unknown. Medieval writers and works continued to link him to Christianity because of his alleged association with Paul. The Golden Legend, a 13th-century hagiographical account of famous saints that was widely read, included an account of Seneca's death scene, and erroneously presented Nero as a witness to Seneca's suicide. Dante placed Seneca (alongside Cicero) among the \\"great spirits\\" in the First Circle of Hell, or Limbo. citing Dante, Inf., 4.141 Boccaccio, who in 1370 came across the works of Tacitus whilst browsing the library at Montecassino, wrote an account of Seneca's suicide hinting that it was a kind of disguised baptism, or a de facto baptism in spirit. Some, such as Albertino Mussato and Giovanni Colonna, went even further and concluded that Seneca must have been a Christian convert. =An improving reputation= The \\"Pseudo-Seneca\\", a Roman bust found at Herculaneum, one of a series of similar sculptures known since the Renaissance, once identified as Seneca. Now commonly identified as Hesiod Seneca remains one of the few popular Roman philosophers from the period. He appears not only in Dante, but also in Chaucer and to a large degree in Petrarch, who adopted his style in his own essays and who quotes him more than any other authority except Virgil. In the Renaissance, printed editions and translations of his works became common, including an edition by Erasmus and a commentary by John Calvin.Richard Mott Gummere, Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message, p. 97. John of Salisbury, Erasmus and others celebrated his works. French essayist Montaigne, who gave a spirited defense of Seneca and Plutarch in his Essays, was himself considered by Pasquier a \\"French Seneca\\".Gummere, Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message, p. 106. Similarly, Thomas Fuller praised Joseph Hall as \\"our English Seneca\\". Many who considered his ideas not particularly original, still argued that he was important in making the Greek philosophers presentable and intelligible.Moses Hadas. The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca, 1958. 3. His suicide has also been a popular subject in art, from Jacques-Louis David's 1773 painting The Death of Seneca to the 1951 film Quo Vadis. Even with the admiration of an earlier group of intellectual stalwarts, Seneca has never been without his detractors. In his own time, he was accused of hypocrisy or, at least, a less than \\"Stoic\\" lifestyle. While banished to Corsica, he wrote a plea for restoration rather incompatible with his advocacy of a simple life and the acceptance of fate. In his Apocolocyntosis he ridiculed the behaviors and policies of Claudius, and flattered Nero‚Äîsuch as proclaiming that Nero would live longer and be wiser than the legendary Nestor. The claims of Publius Suillius Rufus that Seneca acquired some \\"three hundred million sesterces\\" through Nero's favor, are highly partisan, but they reflect the reality that Seneca was both powerful and wealthy. Robin Campbell, a translator of Seneca's letters, writes that the \\"stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries [has been]...the apparent contrast between his philosophical teachings and his practice.\\" In 1562 Gerolamo Cardano wrote an apology praising Nero in his Encomium Neronis, printed in Basel.Available in English as Girolamo Cardano, Nero: an Exemplary Life Inkstone, 2012 This was likely intended as a mock encomium, inverting the portrayal of Nero and Seneca that appears in Tacitus. In this work Cardano portrayed Seneca as a crook of the worst kind, an empty rhetorician who was only thinking to grab money and power, after having poisoned the mind of the young emperor. Cardano stated that Seneca well deserved death. \\"Seneca\\", ancient hero of the modern C√≥rdoba; this architectural roundel in Seville is based on the \\"Pseudo-Seneca\\" (illustration above) Among the historians who have sought to reappraise Seneca is the scholar Anna Lydia Motto who in 1966 argued that the negative image has been based almost entirely on Suillius's account, while many others who might have lauded him have been lost.Lydia Motto, Anna Seneca on Trial: The Case of the Opulent Stoic The Classic Journal, Vol. 61, No. 6 (1966) pp. 254‚Äì58 > \\"We are therefore left with no contemporary record of Seneca's life, save > for the desperate opinion of Publius Suillius.

Examination of Seneca's life and thought in relation to contemporary education and to the psychology of emotions is revealing the relevance of his thought. For example, Martha Nussbaum in her discussion of desire and emotion includes Seneca among the Stoics who offered important insights and perspectives on emotions and their role in our lives.Nussbaum, M. (1996). The Therapy of Desire. Princeton University Press Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management, she shows Seneca's appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger, and its pathological connections. Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca's contribution to political philosophyNussbaum, M. (1999). Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. Harvard University Press showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics, education, and notions of global citizenship‚Äîand finding a basis for reform- minded education in Seneca's ideas she used to propose a mode of modern education that avoids both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition. Elsewhere Seneca has been noted as the first great Western thinker on the complex nature and role of gratitude in human relationships.Harpham, E. (2004). Gratitude in the History of Ideas, 19‚Äì37 in M. A. Emmons and M. E. McCulloch, editors, The Psychology of Gratitude, Oxford University Press. =Notable fictional portrayals= Baroque marble imaginary portrait bust of Seneca, by an anonymous sculptor of the 17th century. Museo del Prado Seneca is a character in Monteverdi's 1642 opera L'incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea), which is based on the pseudo-Senecan play, Octavia. In Nathaniel Lee's 1675 play Nero, Emperor of Rome, Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans, but is dragged off to prison, dying off- stage. He appears in Robert Bridges' verse drama Nero, the second part of which (published 1894) culminates in Seneca's death. Seneca appears in a fairly minor role in Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1896 novel Quo Vadis and was played by Nicholas Hannen in the 1951 film. In Robert Graves' 1934 book Claudius the God, the sequel novel to I, Claudius, Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant. He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius' own ideology. The \\"Pumpkinification\\" (Apocolocyntosis) to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero mocking a man that Seneca groveled to for years. The historical novel Chariot of the Soul by Linda Proud features Seneca as tutor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome.

AD 420 ‚Äì 7 August 461) was the western Roman emperor from 457 to 461. A prominent general of the Roman army, Majorian deposed Emperor Avitus in 457 and succeeded him. Majorian was the last emperor to make a concerted effort to restore the Western Roman Empire with its own forces. Possessing little more than Italy, Dalmatia, and some territory in northern Gaul, Majorian campaigned rigorously for three years against the Empire's enemies. His successors until the fall of the Empire, in 476/480, were actually instruments of their barbarian generals, or emperors chosen and controlled by the Eastern Roman court. After defeating a Vandal attack on Italy, Majorian launched a campaign against the Visigothic Kingdom in southern Gaul. Defeating king Theodoric II at the Battle of Arelate, Majorian forced the Goths to abandon their possessions in Septimania and Hispania and return to federate status immediately. Majorian then attacked the Burgundian Kingdom, defeating them at the Siege of Lugdunum, expelling them from the Rhone valley and reducing them to federate status. In 460, Majorian left Gaul to consolidate his hold on Hispania. His generals launched a campaign against the Suebic Kingdom in northwest Hispania, defeating them at the battles of Lucus Augusti and Scallabis and reducing them to federate status as well. His fleet for his planned campaign to recover Africa from the Vandals was destroyed due to treachery. Majorian sought to reform the imperial administration in order to make it more efficient and just. The powerful general Ricimer deposed and killed Majorian, who had become unpopular with the senatorial aristocracy because of his reforms. To historian Edward Gibbon, Majorian \\"presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species\\".Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XXXVI, \\"Total Extinction Of The Western Empire\\".  Early life  Coin of Majorian The life of Majorian and his reign are better known than those of the other Western Emperors of the same period. The most important sources are the chronicles that cover the second half of the 5th century ‚Äî those of Hydatius and Marcellinus Comes, as well as the fragments of Priscus and John of Antioch. Besides these sources, which are useful also for the biographies of the other emperors, some peculiar sources are available that make Majorian's life known in some detail, both before and after his rise to the throne. The Gallo-Roman aristocrat and poet Sidonius Apollinaris was an acquaintance of the Emperor and composed a panegyric that is the major source for Majorian's life up to 459. As regards his policy, twelve of his laws have been preserved: the so- called Novellae Maioriani were included in the Breviarium that was compiled for the Visigothic king Alaric II in 506, and help to understand the problems that pressed Majorian's government.Mathisen. Majorian was probably born after 420, as in 458 he is defined as a iuvenis, a \\"young man\\". He belonged to the military aristocracy of the Roman Empire. His grandfather of the same name reached the rank of magister militum under Emperor Theodosius I and, as commander-in-chief of the Illyrian army, was present at his coronation at Sirmium in 379. The daughter of the magister militum then married an officer, probably called Domninus,This identification, based on a passage in the work of Priscus, is not universally accepted by the historians. See MacGeorge, p. 188, for a summary of the arguments in favour of the identification, and Arnold Hugh Martin Jones, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, \\"Domninus 3\\", Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , p. 373, for the arguments against it. who administered the finances of Aetius, the powerful magister militum of the West. The couple gave the name Maiorianus to their child in honour of his influential grandfather. Placidia was the younger daughter of Emperor Valentinian III, who planned to marry her to Majorian (450 ca.). As the powerful magister militum Aetius realised that this marriage would weaken his position, he sent Majorian away from his staff to private life, thus hindering the marriage. It was under the same Aetius that Majorian started his military career.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.198‚Äì200. He followed Aetius to Gallia, where he met two officers also under Aetius' command who were to play an important role in Majorian's life: the Suevic-Visigoth RicimerSidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.266‚Äì268. and the Gallo-Roman Aegidius.Priscus, fragment 50. Majorian distinguished himself in the defence of the city of Turonensis (modern Tours) and in a battle against the Franks of king Clodio, near Vicus HelenaThe exact location of Vicus Helena is unknown, but it was in Northern France, probably near modern Arras (Jan Willem Drijvers, Helena Augusta, BRILL, , p. 12). (447 or 448). In the latter, Majorian fought at the head of his cavalry on a bridge, while Aetius controlled the roads leading to the battlefield:Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.207‚Äì227. Around 450, the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian III considered the possibility of marrying his daughter Placidia to Majorian. Valentinian had two daughters and no sons, and therefore no heir to the throne. Having Majorian as son-in-law would have strengthened Valentinian in the face of other powerful generals and would have solved the problem of the succession. Furthermore, as Emperor, Majorian could have led the army himself, freed from the dangerous bond with a powerful general, such as Valentinian had been obliged to contract with Aetius.O'Flynn, pp. 94‚Äì95. The intention of this plan was to avoid the possibility that barbarian generals like Huneric or Attila should succeed to Aetius, but clashed with the plans of Aetius himself. The Roman general, in fact, planned to marry his own son Gaudentius to Placidia. He therefore opposed Valentinian's plan, and put an end to Majorian's military career, expelling him from his staff and sending him to his country estate. According to the poet Sidonius Apollinaris, the cause of the fall of Majorian was the jealousy of Aetius' wife, who feared that Majorian could overshadow Aetius' prestige.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.290‚Äì300. It was only in 454 that Majorian was able to return to public life. In that year, Valentinian III killed Aetius with his own hands but, fearing that Aetius' troops might revolt, called Majorian back to office to quell any dissent.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.305‚Äì308. In the following year, Valentinian III was killed by two former officers of Aetius' staff. There was then a fight for the succession, as no heir existed. Majorian played the role of the candidate for the throne of Licinia Eudoxia, Valentinian's widow, and of Ricimer, who reserved for himself a role similar to Aetius'.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.312‚Äì314; John of Antioch, fragment 201.6. In the end, the new Emperor was Petronius Maximus, a senator involved in Valentinian's murder, who outmanoeuvred the other candidates. To strengthen his position, he obliged Licinia to marry him and promoted Majorian to the rank of comes domesticorum (commander-in-chief of the imperial guard).It is however possible that Majorian was appointed comes domesticorum by Valentinian when he was recalled back in service after Aetius' murder (Mathisen). Petronius ruled only for a few weeks, as he was killed during the Vandal sack of Rome (May 455). He was succeeded, not by Majorian, but by the Gallic-Roman noble Avitus, who had the support of the Visigoths. Both Majorian, comes domesticorum, and Ricimer, comes rei militaris of Italy, initially supported Avitus, but when the Emperor lost the loyalty of the Italian aristocracy, the two generals revolted against him. First Majorian and Ricimer killed Remistus, the magister militum entrusted by Avitus with the defence of the capital, Ravenna. Then Ricimer defeated Avitus' troops near Placentia, taking the Emperor himself prisoner, and obliging him to abdicate. Finally, Majorian caused Avitus' death, possibly starving him, in early 457.John of Antioch, fragment 202.  Rise to the throne  Avitus was dead and the Western throne without a pretender. It was thus for the Eastern Roman Emperor to choose the successor, but Marcian could do nothing, as he died on January 27, 457. His successor on the Eastern throne was the general Leo I, who did not, however, select a colleague for the West, possibly because he intended to reign alone.After the death of Libius Severus in 465, Leo waited two years to select a new colleague, Anthemius. On the other hand, Leo rewarded both Majorian and Ricimer: the former was appointed magister militum, the latter patricius and magister militum (February 28, 457).Fasti vindobonenses priores, 583. While the situation was in a precarious equilibrium, a troop of 900 Alemanni invaded Italy. They entered from Raetia and penetrated Italian territory down to Lake Maggiore. There they were intercepted and defeated by the troops of comes Burco, sent by Majorian to stop them:Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.373‚Äì385. This victory was celebrated as Majorian's own, and the magister militum was acclaimed Emperor by the army on April 1, six miles outside Ravenna, at a place called ad Columellas, \\"at the Little Columns\\". There were actually two magistri militum to choose between, Majorian and Ricimer, but the barbarian origin of the latter barred him from the throne. Ricimer could, however, expect to exert a great influence on the new Western Emperor, because of their relationship dating back to the time of their service under Aetius and because of his control of the army as magister militum. In his panegyric to Majorian, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris tells that Majorian initially refused the election:Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.9‚Äì12. Modern historians think that it was Leo I who initially refused to recognize Majorian as his colleague, although the general chosen by the army must have seemed the only viable candidate to the throne. The Eastern court was not displeased with the deposition of Avitus, an Emperor chosen by the Visigoths, whereas the only other candidate, Olybrius, had a politically difficult relationship with the Vandal king Genseric and no influence on the army. Despite this, the approval by the Eastern court of Majorian's election came late, as the new Emperor was actually crowned only on December 28.Auctarium Prosperi Hauniensis, s.a. 458. Leo I and Majorian jointly assumed the consulate for the year 458; it was customary that a new Emperor took this magistracy on the first year started as Emperor.  Foreign affairs  = Defence of Italy = The first problems Majorian had to handle were the consolidation of his rule over Italy and the recovery of Gaul, since this province had rebelled after the deposition of the Gallo-Roman emperor Avitus. The recovery of the lost provinces of Hispania and Africa was a project that Majorian had to leave for later. In summer 457, a group of Vandals, led by the brother-in-law of Genseric, landed in Campania, at the mouth of the Liri or the Garigliano river, and started devastating and sacking the region. Majorian personally led the Roman army to a victory over the invaders near Sinuessa and followed the defeated Vandals, loaded with their booty, as far as their own ships, killing many of them including their commander.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.385‚Äì440 and A. Loyen, Recherches historiques sur les pan√©giriques de Sidonine Apollinaire, Paris 1942, pp. 76‚Äì77 and note 5. Cited in Savino, Eliodoro, Campania tardoantica (284‚Äì604 d.C.), Edipuglia, 2005, , p. 84. After this event, Majorian understood that he had to take the initiative, if he wanted to defend the heart of his Empire, the only territory he actually controlled. So he decided to strengthen its defences. First, he issued a law, the Novella Maioriani 8 known as De reddito iure armorum (\\"On the Return of the Right to Bear Arms\\"), concerning the personal right to bear arms; in 440 Valentinian III had already promulgated a law with the same name, Novella Valentiniani 9, after another attack of the Vandals. It is probably to this time that another law is to be dated, the Novella Maioriani 12 known as De aurigis et seditiosis (\\"Concerning Charioteers and Seditious Persons\\"), to quell the disorders that sprang up during the chariot races. Both these laws are now lost. He then strengthened the army, recruiting a large number of barbarian mercenaries, including Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugii, Burgundians, Huns, Bastarnae, Suebi, Scythians and Alans.Gibbon. Finally, he rebuilt two fleets, probably those of Miseno and Ravenna, since the Vandals had a strong navy:Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.441‚Äì442. = Re-conquest of Gaul = During his four-year reign Majorian reconquered most of Hispania and southern Gaul, meanwhile reducing the Visigoths, Burgundians and Suevi to federate status. After consolidating his position in Italy, Majorian concentrated on the recovery of Gaul. When news of the deposition of the Gallo-Roman emperor Avitus arrived in Gaul, the province refused to recognize Majorian as his successor. An important clue to this is an inscription found in Lugdunum (modern Lyons) and dating to 458: according to Roman custom, the inscriptions were dated reporting the name of the consuls in office, who that year were Leo I and Majorian. This inscription, instead, records only the name of Eastern Emperor, showing that Majorian was not recognized as lawful Emperor., to be compared to . Another clue is the fact that, at the death of Avitus, the citizens of Lugdunum had allowed the Burgundians of king Gondioc to occupy the city, and that they sent an envoy to Leo, and not to Majorian, to ask for a reduction of taxation.Gregory of Tours, Glory of the Confessors 62. Cited in Mathisen. Finally, there is a record of a failed usurpation in Gaul, around this time.Sidonius Apollinaris tells (Letters, I.11.6) that this usurpation regarded some Marcellus. The hypothesis that this Marcellus is to be identified with the semi-independent comes of Illyricum Marcellinus has been rejected, as this conspiracy was to put Avitus back on the throne, or to oppose a Gallo-Roman noble to Majorian. In late 458, Majorian entered Gaul, with an army strengthened by barbarian units.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.474‚Äì477. The Emperor personally led the army, leaving Ricimer in Italy and choosing Aegidius and the magister militiae Nepotianus as collaborators. The imperial army defeated the Visigoths under king Theodoric II at the Battle of Arelate, forcing the Visigoths to abandon Septimania and withdraw west to Aquitania. The Roman victory was decisive: under the new treaty the Visigoths had to relinquish their vast conquests in Hispania and return to federate status. Majorian chose his trusted general Aegidius as the new magister militum per Gallias (military commander of Gaul) and sent an envoy to Hispania, to report the victory over the Visigoths and the new treaty with Theodoric II.Hydatius, 197, s.a. 459; Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, II.11. With the help of his new foederati, Majorian entered the Rhone Valley, conquering its populations \\"some by arms and some by diplomacy\\".Priscus, fragment 27. He defeated the Burgundians and besieged and conquered the city of Lugdunum: the rebel city was heavily fined, while the Bagaudae were forced to join the Empire. Despite the fact that the Gallo-Roman aristocracy had sided with Avitus, Majorian wanted a reconciliation, not a punishment. With the intercession of Majorian's magister epistolarum Petrus, Sidonius Apollinaris, the son-in-law of Avitus, was allowed to deliver a panegyricSidonius Apollinaris' Carmen V. in honour of the Emperor (early January 459), receiving in reward the appointment to the rank of comes spectabilis. Much more effective was, however, the granting of the tax remission that the citizens of Lugdunum had requested from Leo I.Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina, V.574‚Äì585. = Campaign in Hispania = The Roman Empire in 460 during the reign of Majorian. In the wake of the Vandal sack of Rome (455), the Visigoths had conquered Hispania, formally in the name of the new Western Emperor Avitus, actually controlling the territory themselves. Majorian planned to reconquer Hispania and use it as the base for the conquest of Africa. This rich province of the Western Empire, which provided for the very important grain supply to the city of Rome, was in fact under Vandal control. According to the historian Procopius, Majorian, \\"who surpassed in every virtue all who have ever been emperors of the Romans\\", wanted to know personally the military readiness of the Vandals and how the local populations would react to the Roman invasion. He dyed black his fair hair, for which he was famous, and went to Genseric claiming to be an envoy of the Western Emperor. Genseric tried to impress the enemy ambassador by showing him the arms collected in the warehouses and sent him back.Procopius, VII.4‚Äì13. This story is probably only a legend of Italian folklore,MacGeorge, p. 214. but it is a clue to the care with which the expedition was prepared. Majorian collected information on the enemy and gathered a fleet of three hundred ships to support the army in the reconquest of Hispania and in the invasion of Africa. It was probably during the preparation of this operation that Majorian sent the comes and patricius Occidentis Marcellinus to Sicily with an army of Huns, to take the island back from the Vandals. Marcellinus was the comes rei militaris (governor) of Illyricum, but he had become practically independent since the death of Aetius, not recognizing the imperial authority. Majorian convinced him to accept him as Emperor and even to collaborate with his troops in the military recovery of the Empire.Arnold Hugh Martin Jones, The Later Roman Empire, 284‚Äì602, JHU Press, 1986, , p. 241. MacGeorge, however, maintains that Marcellinus' return under the Western Emperor's rule is not attested, and thinks that Marcellinus was in Sicily either to take part independently in the campaign against the Vandals or, by order of the Eastern Emperor, to put pressure on Geiseric for the restitution of Empress Eudoxia and her daughters (pp. 46‚Äì48). The campaign started with an operation against the Suebi in North-Western Hispania, lasting the whole of 459, led by the magister militiae Nepotianus and the Gothic comes Sunieric. Majorian gathered the main part of the army in Liguria, then entered Aquitaine and Novempopulania coming from Theodoric's court in Toulouse (May 460). Genseric, fearing the Roman invasion, tried to negotiate a peace with Majorian, who rejected the proposal. The Vandal king then decided to devastate Mauretania, his own territory, because he thought that the Roman army would land there, and also ordered his navy to prepare incursions in the waters near the probable invasion area. In the meantime, Majorian was conquering Hispania. While Nepotianus and Sunieric defeated the Suebi at Lucus Augusti (modern Lugo) and conquered Scallabis in Lusitania (modern Santar√©m, Portugal), the Emperor passed through Caesaraugusta (Saragossa), where he performed a formal imperial adventus.Roger Collins, Visigothic Spain, 409‚Äì711, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, , p. 32. Finally he reached Carthaginiensis, where his fleet, docked at Portus Illicitanus (near Elche), was destroyed by traitors paid by the Vandals:Chronica gallica anno 511, 634; Marius Aventicensis, s.a. 460; Hydatius, 200, s.a. 460. Majorian, deprived of the fleet that was necessary for the invasion, cancelled the attack on the Vandals. He received the ambassadors of Genseric, with whom he agreed to conclude peace, which probably included the recognition of the de facto occupation of Mauretania by the Vandals. On his way back to Italy, the Emperor stopped at Arelate.Chronica gallica anno 511.  Domestic policy  Majorian's domestic policy is known thanks to some of the laws he issued, the so-called Novellae Maioriani, that were included in a collection of Roman law entitled Breviarium, requested from some Gallo-Roman jurists in 506 by the Visigothic king Alaric II .Clyde Pharr, The Theodosian code and novels, and the Sirmondian constitutions, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., 2001, , pp. 551‚Äì561. The preserved laws are: * Novella Maioriani 1, De ortu imperii domini Majoriani Augusti, \\"The Beginning of the Reign of Our Lord Majorian Augustus\\", opening speech of his reign, addressed to the Roman Senate (given in Ravenna, on January 11, 458); * Novella Maioriani 2, De indulgentiis reliquorum, \\"On the Remission of Past-Due Accounts\\" (given in Ravenna, on March 11, 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy); * Novella Maioriani 3, De defensoribus civitatum, \\"The Defenders of the Municipalities\\", on the office of defensor civitatum (given in Ravenna, on May 8, 458, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 4, De aedificiis pubblicis, \\"Public Buildings\\", on the preservation of the monuments of Rome (given in Ravenna, on July 11, 458, to Aemilianus, praefectus urbi of Rome, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 5, De bonis caducis sive proscriptorum, \\"On Abandoned Property and That of Proscribed Persons\\" (given in Ravenna, on September 4, 458, to Ennodius,This Ennodius was a relative of the poet and bishop Magnus Felix Ennodius (474‚Äì521). comes privatae largitionis, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 6, De sanctimonialibus vel viduis et de successionibus earum, \\"Holy Maidens, Widows, and Their Succession\\" (given in Ravenna, on October 26, 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 7, De curialibus et de agnatione vel distractione praediorum et de ceteris negotiis, \\"Curiales, Their Children and The Sale of Their Landed Estates\\" (given in Ravenna, on November 6, 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 8, De reddito iure armorum, \\"On the Return of the Right to Bear Arms\\", whose text is lost; * Novella Maioriani 9, De adulteriis, \\"Adultery\\", confirming that the adulterers are to be put to death (given in Arelate, on April 17, 459, to Rogatianus, governor of Suburbicarian Tuscany, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 10, about the right of the Roman senators and of the Church to keep the goods received in a will, whose text is lost; * Novella Maioriani 11, De episcopali iudicio et ne quis invitus clericus ordinetur vel de ceteris negotiis, \\"Episcopal Courts; No Person Shall Be Ordained A Cleric Against His Will; Various Matters\\", (given in Arelate, on March 28, 460, to Ricimer, also in the name of Leo I); * Novella Maioriani 12, De aurigis et seditiosis, \\"Charioteers and Seditious Persons\\", whose text is lost. = Fiscal policy and coinage = Tremissis minted by a Visigothic king in the name of Majorian. These coins were minted in Arelate between 457 and 507 by the Visigoths, but they carried the portrait and the name of the Roman Emperor, corrupted in iviivs haiorianvs. Even if their style was close to the Roman originals, Visigothic coins contained less precious metal; it was probably for this reason that Majorian issued a law obliging the tax collectors to accept golden coins at their nominal value, with the exception of the \\"Gallic\\" coin, of lesser value.Novella Maioriani 7.14, November 6, 458, cited in Mathisen. Majorian understood that he could reign effectively only with the support of the senatorial aristocracy, whom he wanted to return to its pristine political prominence. At the same time, he planned to reduce the abuses perpetrated by the senators, many of whom cultivated their local interests disregarding the imperial policies, even refusing to pay taxes and keeping for themselves the taxes they had exacted. This fiscal evasion had a cascade effect that affected the small landowners, the citizens and the local civil magistrates. For example, the decurions had personally to compensate the imperial treasury for all taxes not exacted. Sometimes, oppressed by the debts accumulated in this way, the decurions abandoned their status, a problem already addressed by Emperor Julian (361‚Äì363). Majorian also cancelled tax arrears, knowing that fiscal policy could not be effective if taxpayers had to pay large accumulated arrears. On March 11, 458, Majorian issued a law entitled De indulgentiis reliquorum, \\"On the Remission of Past-Due Accounts\\" (Novella Maioriani 2). This law remitted all the tax arrears of the landowners. This same law explicitly prohibited public administrators, who had a record of keeping the collected money for themselves, from collecting taxes. This task was to be reserved to the governors alone. Another law issued to reorganise the tax system was issued on September 4 of the same year, and was entitled De bonis caducis sive proscriptorum, \\"On Abandoned Property and That of Proscribed Persons\\" (Novella Maioriani 5): the comes privatae largitionis Ennodius was to admonish the provincial judges against defrauding the imperial treasure by keeping for themselves a part of the money collected. The Emperor was also interested in repairing the backbone of the imperial administration. On 8 May 458, Majorian issued a law entitled De defensoribus civitatum, \\"The Defenders of the Municipalities\\" (Novella Maioriani 3), to re-establish the office of the defensor civitatis. This city magistrate represented the interests of the citizens in trials against the public administration, particularly in fiscal matters; this magistracy was still in existence, but actually ineffective, since it was often held by the same officials who cheated the population. Another law was issued on November 6 to strengthen the magistracy of the decurions. De curialibus et de agnatione vel distractione praediorum et de ceteris negotiis, \\"Decurions, Their Children and The Sale of Their Landed Estates\\" (Novella Maioriani 7), was issued to forgive past abuses perpetrated by the decurions. This forbade them from leaving their status (going into hiding or marrying slave or tenant farmers) or alienating their own properties. Majorian minted coins in gold, silver and bronze. Gold coinage was minted in great quantities. On these coins the Emperor is depicted, with few exceptions, with a combat helmet, a spear, a shield and a chi-rho, looking towards right; this typology was derived from a rare type minted in Ravenna for Honorius and used in great quantities only by Majorian, while it was dropped by his successors. The first series of solidi were minted probably in Ravenna, and bear at the obverse the joint portrait of Majorian and Leo I, thus celebrating the mutual recognition of the two Roman emperors. The mints of Ravenna and Milan issued both solidi and tremisses from the beginning of Majorian's reign.Vagi, David, Coinage and history of the Roman Empire, c. 82 B.C.A.D. 480, Taylor & Francis, , p. 567. No series of semisses are attested for these two mints, probably because the semisses were typically minted by the mint of Rome and this mint was not active under Majorian, who never visited the ancient capital of his Empire during his four years of rule. The minting of solidi is attested for the mint of Arelate in 458, a fact compatible with the presence of Majorian in Gaul in that year. This mint was again active in 460, when the Emperor returned from his campaign in Hispania. The Visigoths minted some reproductions of his solidi, modelled after the issues of the Arelate mint: as Arelate issued only solidi, the Visigoths used those designs also for the tremissis. Silver coinage was issued almost exclusively by the Gallic mints; it has been suggested that these series were not issued by Majorian, but by Aegidius after the Emperor's death, to mark the fact that he did not recognize his successor, Libius Severus. Majorian also produced great quantities of nummi of great weight, mostly minted at Ravenna and Milan, and some contorniates, mostly in Rome, but probably also in Ravenna. = Natalist policies = The diffusion of Christianity in the Empire caused some social changes within the aristocratic families. In several wealthy families, daughters were obliged to take religious vows and never marry, so that the family wealth would not be dispersed in dowries. Majorian thought that this behaviour was harmful to the State, because it reduced the number of Roman children, and because it caused the girls to start illicit affairs. On October 26, 458, the Emperor addressed a law, the Novella Maioriani 6, to the Praetorian prefect of Italy, Caecina Decius Basilius.Novella Maioriani 6.1‚Äì3, cited in Grubbs, p. 110. This law, titled De sanctimonialibus vel viduis et de successionibus earum (\\"Holy Maidens, Widows, and Their Succession\\"), imposed a minimum age of 40 for taking religious vows, considering that at this age the sexual drives of the initiated would be dormant. The law also granted women who had been forced to take religious vows, and were subsequently disinherited, the same rights on the legacy of parents as their brothers and sisters. In order to solve this same problem of the decline of the Roman population, in particular compared with the growth of the barbarians allocated within the imperial boundaries, Majorian addressed the problem of young women widowed and without children who never remarried because of the influence of the clergy, to whom they destined their goods in their will.Novella Maioriani 6.5‚Äì8, cited in Grubbs, pp. 232‚Äì234. The young widows were prohibited from taking religious vows. By the same measure, departing in this from the policy of the Eastern Empire, Majorian insisted that a marriage without dowry and pre-wedding exchange of gifts (first from the bride's family to the groom, then in the opposite direction) was invalid; he simultaneously ended the practice of requesting pre-wedding gifts of a value considerably higher than the dowry.Novella Maioriani 6.9‚Äì103, cited in Grubbs, p. 119. = Relationship with the senatorial aristocracy = Avitus, the predecessor of Majorian on the imperial throne, had alienated the support of the Roman senatorial aristocracy by appointing members of the Gallo-Roman aristocracy, of which he was a part, to the most important offices of the imperial administration. He was overthrown by Majorian, who did not repeat the error and rotated the main offices between representatives of the two aristocracies. When Majorian took power by deposing Avitus, the province of Gaul, where Avitus' power was based, did not recognize the new Emperor. When Majorian re-conquered the province, he chose to forgive this rebellion. The reason was that Majorian understood that one of the mistakes of his predecessor was to promote and trust only the senatorial aristocracy of Gaul, the region he came from, favouring it over the senatorial aristocracy of Italy. Majorian, instead, decided to gain the favour of the wealthy and noble families of the recovered province by involving them in the imperial administration, together with the Italian aristocracy that had supported him since the beginning. For evidence of this policy, one can point to the origins of the high civil servants of his administration, in particular of the consuls, whom the Emperor appointed jointly with his Eastern colleague. In the first year (458) Majorian reserved the honour for himself, as was usual for the augusti, while in the second year he appointed his former colleague and powerful magister militum, Ricimer. Then, for the year 460, he choose the Gallic senator Magnus, and for the next year the Italian senator Severinus. Magnus had been appointed Praetorian prefect of Gaul in 458, while the Praetorian prefect of Italy was Caecina Decius Basilius, who was the patron of the Gallic senator (and poet) Sidonius Apollinaris, while the comes privatae largitionis, Ennodius, was related to a family with interests in Arelate. Majorian also showed great respect towards the Roman senate, as suggested by the message he addressed to it on the eve of his coronation: he promised the senators he would not take into account the accusations of informers, which were much feared as they might be used by the Emperor to cause the fall of influential figures.Novella Maioriani 1, De ortu imperii domini Majoriani Augusti, \\"The Beginning of the Reign of Our Lord Majorian Augustus\\". He followed through on his promises, as told by Sidonius Apollinaris, who had been anonymously accused of the authorship of a pamphlet against some influential figures: during a dinner together, Majorian defused the risky situation with a witticism.This event took place in 461, and is recorded in a letter (Letters, I.11.2‚Äì15) of Apollinaris to a friend (Mathisen). = Conservation of the monuments of Rome = From the beginning of the 4th century, the monuments of Rome, and more generally all buildings of some value that were in a state of neglect for various reasons, were increasingly used as quarries for valuable building materials. This practice, in fact, was cheaper and more convenient than import from remote locations, which was sometimes rendered difficult or impossible by the control of the sea by the Vandals.Paolo Delogu, Le invasioni barbariche nel meridione dell'impero: Visigoti, Vandali, Ostrogoti, Rubettino, p. 336. Roman officials conceded upon petition the use for construction of marble, stone and brick recovered from demolition of ancient monuments: To cope with this phenomenon, Majorian promulgated a law, Novella Maioriani 4, De aedificiis pubblicis (\\"Public Buildings\\"), in Ravenna on July 11, 459, addressed to Aemilianus, praefectus urbi of Rome. The punishment for judges who had allowed the destruction of ancient public buildings was 50 pounds of gold, while their subordinates were whipped and had both hands amputated. Those who had removed materials from public buildings were to return them. The Senate had the power to decide whether there were extreme conditions that justified the demolition of an old building and, if it decided for the demolition, the Emperor still had the right to order that the resulting materials should be used to decorate other public buildings.  Fall and death  As coin of Majorian. Just as Avitus had been betrayed by Ricimer and Majorian and by the dismissal of his German guard, so the fate of Majorian himself was decided by the disbandment of his army and a plot organized by Ricimer. In fact, while the Emperor was busy away from Italy, the barbarian patricius et magister militum had gathered around himself the aristocratic opposition to his former comrade with whom, just a few years earlier, he had cultivated dreams of power. Majorian's legislation had shown that he intended to intervene decisively on issues that plagued the empire, even if they countered the interests of influential aristocrats.Hydatius, 210. After spending some time at Arelate, his base at the end of the operation against the Vandals in Hispania, Majorian disbanded his barbarian mercenaries and, accompanied by some guards, set off to Rome, where he intended to carry out reforms. Ricimer went to meet Majorian with a military detachment; the magister militum met the Emperor near Tortona (not far from Piacenza, where Avitus had been killed), and had him arrested and deposed (August 3). The Emperor was deprived of his dress and diadem, beaten and tortured. After five days, Majorian was beheaded near the river Iria (August 7, 461):John of Antioch, fragment 203; Marcellinus, sa 461; Fasti vindobonenses priores, No 588. Procopius (VII.14‚Äì15) does not mention the Emperor's return from Hispania and said that Majorian died of dysentery: it is possible that the news has been put about by Ricimer (Fik Meijer, Emperors Do not Die in Bed, Routledge, 2004, , p. 155). Victor of Tonnena erroneously claims that Majorian reached Rome and was killed there, and puts this event in 463 (Chronica, s.a. 463). He was about forty years old and had reigned for four years. The city of Tortona now hosts, in the church of St. Matthew, a building traditionally identified as the \\"mausoleum of Majorian\\".\\"Mausoleo di Maiorano (Sec. I a.C.)\\" , Citt√† di Tortona. After the death of Majorian, Ricimer waited for three months before placing on the imperial throne a person he believed he could manipulate. He finally chose Libius Severus, a senator of no political distinction, probably selected to please the Italian senatorial aristocracy. The new emperor was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor Leo I, nor by any of the generals who had served under Majorian: not by Aegidius in Gaul, not by Marcellinus in Sicily and Illyria, and not by Nepotianus in Hispania.O'Flynn, p. 111. Legacy According to historian Edward Gibbon, Majorian \\"presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species\\". The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica likewise calls him \\"the only man to hold that office [i.e. the imperial throne] in the 5th century who had some claim to greatness.\\"  Notes   Sources  = Primary sources = * Hydatius, Chronicle * John of Antioch, Historia chronike * Jordanes, Getica * Marcellinus Comes, Annales * Priscus, History * Procopius, Vandal War * Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina; Letters.
