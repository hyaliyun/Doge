It was home to Governor Thomas Ward Veazey (Governor from 1836 to 1839) and John Ward, Colonel of the Provincial Militia of Cecil County (1756). This fine Georgian manor house was probably built earlier than 1770, more likely 1740 to 1760. It was built on land patented to John Ward in 1674. The Ward family occupied it for at least 100 years. It was one of the fox hunting centers of Cecil County Maryland, that sport being one of the early settlers' favorites. The mansion is noted for its architectural purity and for its paneling and fine woodwork. Especially noteworthy are the Wall of Troy and the Rose of Sharon molding. The original brick dependencies were still standing in 1967. Other noteworthy features are the large reception hall with its graceful, easy-tread stairway; the big fireplaces in both wings, as well as smaller ones in each of the rooms the fanlights over the double door entrances to each of the wings; the family graveyard; the old boxwood and the large maple tree, one of the largest in the state of Maryland.

He was the second son of Henry VII with a Scar, Duke of Brzeg, but the eldest born by his second wife Margareta, daughter of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia. Life Little is known about Louis II's first years. The death of his father in 1399 left him and his older half-brother Henry IX as the co- rulers of the Duchy of Brieg; however, one year later (October 1400) they decided to make a formal division of their domains: Louis II retained Brieg and Henry IX took Lubin (Lüben), Chojnów (Haynau) and Oława (Ohlau). On 17 July 1402 both brothers appeared in a meeting of Piast Dukes in Wroclaw, in which they concluded with each other and the other Dukes a defensive alliance and paid homage to King Wenceslaus IV. In 1404 Louis II made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, during which he was imprisoned by the Saracens. The unfortunate news reached Brzeg only at the end of the year. Henry IX, in order to gather the ransom for his brother, imposed on the inhabitants of Brzeg, as well on his own subjects of Chojnów and Oława an additional tax. The needed sum of 4,000 fines was collected shortly after; however, Louis II wasn't returned to Silesia until the end of 1405. During his captivity, his brother held the regency over his Duchy of Brieg. Relations between the brothers (which since their childhood had always been close and warm) suffered a total breakdown in connection with the issue of the succession over the Duchy of Legnica. In March 1409 Duke Wenceslaus II of Legnica, Bishop of Wroclaw, decided to name Louis II as his heir, left him Legnica and a half of Złotoryja (Goldberg). The rights over the other half of Złotoryja and a rent of 6,000 fines were assigned to Henryk IX. Wenceslaus II also decided that both brothers had the option to take control over all Złotoryja if one paid the other in compensation. In the same year Louis II purchased from Henry IX his part of Złotoryja. At this point, the Duke of Lubin (already infuriated by the favoritism of Wenceslaus II over Louis II) and his younger brother broke their friendly relations. Soon the dispute turned into an open war, begun by Henry IX, which occurred during the years 1411–1414. Eventually, on 16 March 1413 Wenceslaus II resigned from the government of Legnica, and gave it to Louis II. The war continued despite the mediation of Wenceslaus II, who tried to persuade Henry IX to stop. The dispute only ended thanks to the action of King Wenceslaus IV, who forbade his vassals from fighting. The brothers were finally reconciled and issued a document on mutual help. The residents of the Duchy of Legnica-Złotoryja were obliged to pay homage to both Dukes. In 1419 Ludwik II obtained the town of Krnov for life, and in 1427 Strzelin. In 1413 he had already pledged the towns of Kluczbork, Wołczyn and Byczyna to Conrad VII the White, Duke of Oleśnica, who finally bought them in 1420. In 1434 Conrad VII also pledged these lands, this time to the Dukes of Opole. Marriages and Issue Before 14 August 1409, Ludwik II married firstly Hedwig Zápolya (d. 1414), daughter of a Hungarian baron. They had no children. In Konstanz on 9 April 1418, Ludwik II married secondly Elisabeth (b. 1 May/29 September 1403 – d. Legnica, 31 October 1449), daughter of Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg. They had four children: #Louis (b. 1419/20 – d. bef. 7 January 1435) #Elisabeth (b. 5 January 1426 – d. bef. 7 January 1435) #Magdalena (b. ca. 1430 – d. 10 September 1497), married by February 1442 to Duke Nicholas I of Opole. #Hedwig (b. ca. 1433 – d. 21 October 1471), married in February 1445 to Duke Jan I of Lubin. The death of his only son left Louis II without heirs. On his death, one year later, he left the duchies of Legnica and Brieg to his wife as dower. Eventually, both duchies were obtained by his grandson Frederick I of Legnica -Hedwig's son- in 1481.

Until the early 20th century the scientific name was usually written with a hyphen and spelled \\"pes-pelicani\\". Etymology and nomenclature The specific name pespelecani is Latin, and means the same thing as the common name: \\"pelican's foot\\". This name is based on the shape of the three-pointed (or four-pointed) expanded outer lip of the adult shell, which resembles the webbed foot of a sea bird such as a pelican. The specific name is often spelled pespelicani by analogy with the modern spelling of the word \\"pelican\\", however this is incorrect. It was not the original spelling as used by Linnaeus, the original authority of the species, which he called Strombus Pes pelecani. The rules of the ICZN state that the original spelling of a species name is the correct one, even in cases where the word was originally misspelled, or is not in line with current spelling. However, in this case, the specific name must now be written as one word, not two, and cannot be hyphenated. Distribution This snail lives in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea and also in the Black Sea. Habitat This species of sea snail lives below the low tide level, in the sublittoral zone, from 10 to 130 m depth, on mud or muddy sand. The empty shells do sometimes wash up on beaches however.

Their mother, the Dowager Duchess Margareta, received the Duchy of Ohlau as a widow's land. In 1446, the difficult financial situation forced John I and Henry X to pledged Lüben to Duke Henry IX of Glogau. The death of Elisabeth of Brandenburg, Dowager Duchess of Brieg-Liegnitz in 1449 left in jeopardy the future of the Duchy of Liegnitz. John I and Henry X were the legitimate heirs of that land, as grandsons of Duke Henry IX of Lüben, elder brother of Duke Louis II, Elisabeth's late husband, who left her Liegnitz and Brieg (already give by the Dowager Duchess to both brothers in 1443) in 1436; in addition, John I had another claim over Liegnitz through his marriage with Hedwig, youngest daughter of Louis II and Elisabeth.

The formerly independent families Dicranopteridaceae and Stromatopteridaceae are generally included in the Gleicheniaceae, whereas the Dipteridaceae and Matoniaceae, although closely related, are considered separate families by most authors.Smith et al. (2006) Description These tropical ferns are the most widespread living lineage of Gleicheniales. Their rhizomes have a \\"vitalized\\" protostele or in some taxa a solenostele. The leaves are indeterminate, with pseudodichotomously forked leaves except in Stromatopteris, and free veins. The sori are abaxial but not marginal and carry 5–15 exindusiate round sporangia each. These have a transverse-oblique annulus and contain 128 to 800 bilateral or globose-tetrahedral spores. The sori and sporangia mature at the same time, and the spores grow into surface- dwelling green prothalli beset with club-shaped hairs. Systematics There is some dispute about ranking these ferns. They are typically placed in the order Gleicheniales. They may alternatively be considered a subclass Gleicheniatae or class Gleichenopsida, so that a distinct taxon can be established for the leptosporangiate ferns. In this case, the Gleicheniaceae are upranked to an order and receive the name Gleicheniales. Irrespective of their modern taxonomic treatment, the Gleicheniaceae were formerly included in the order Polypodiales. But the ferns in the loose sense are much too diverse a group to be shoehorned into one taxon at such a low rank. The Triassic Antarctipteris and Gleichenipteris are sometimes ascribed to the Gleicheniaceae, but are probably better considered Gleicheniales incertae sedis. The six extant genera recognized are: * Dicranopteris * Diplopterygium * Gleichenella * Gleichenia * Sticherus * Stromatopteris Footnotes References * A. R. Smith, A. R. Kathleen, M. Pryer, E.

He was a mechanic by trade.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-39, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006, p. 284 Early life Hedilla was born in a village in Cantabria with his civil servant father dying when Hedilla was still a boy. He was educated at Roman Catholic schools in Bilbao before taking an apprenticeship as a shipyard worker, a route that led to unemployment as Spain's shipping industry was in terminal decline.Aristotle A. Kallis, The Fascism Reader, Routledge, 2003, p. 427 Under the government of Miguel Primo de Rivera he returned to work on a road-building project, although he was once again unemployed following the collapse of that regime.Kallis, Fascism Reader, p. 427 He moved to Madrid to set up his own garage, although the business was a failure.Kallis, Fascism Reader, p. 427 Falangist involvement In Madrid, Hedilla took up a job as an engineer at a Catholic dairy farm co-operative and whilst involved in this he joined the Traditionalist wing of the Falange.Kallis, Fascism Reader, p. 427 Hedilla was an original member of the Falange and a close associate of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who during the early stages of the Spanish Civil War was recognised as the leader of the so-called 'Old Shirts'.E. de Blaye, Franco and the Politics of Spain, Penguin Books, 1976, p. 140 Indeed, immediately after Primo de Rivera's death he was briefly nominal leader of the Falange before Franco quickly established full control of the movement for himself.C.P. Blamires, World Fascism - A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 220 Clash with Franco Although nominally the Falangist leader in Santander, Hedilla was based in A Coruña when the northern uprising began. He thus took charge of securing this city and was responsible for the bloody repressions. Despite this Hedilla, who was on the left wing of the Falange and emphasised the proletarian and syndicalist nature of the movement soon became a critic of the indiscriminate violence being perpetrated by the Nationalists. Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 284 Following the death of José Antonio Primo de Rivera Hedilla was nominated as his successor but he was soon at the centre of a power struggle between himself and the legitimistas led by Agustín Aznar and Sancho Dávila y Fernández de Celis.Paul Preston, Franco, London: 1995, pp. 261-6 Hedilla's pro-social reform position won the support of the German ambassador General Wilhelm Faupel and, although Hedilla was not directly involved, his followers took the initiative in Salamanca on April 16, 1937 by attempting to wrest control of the Falangist headquarters from rightist leader Sancho Dávila.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 285 In the aftermath of the event Hedilla secured his own leadership of the Falange two days later although his triumph was short-lived as Franco checked his power by immediately announcing the formation of the Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx of the Assemblies of National-Syndicalist Offensive as a grand party of all his followers, including Hedilla's followers.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 285 Problems were escalated when Hedilla's close ally José Sáinz Nothnagel sent a telegram to Falangist leaders telling them to ignore all merger orders apart from those delivered 'through proper hierarchical channels'. Whilst the message was vague as to whom the proper channels actually meant it was taken by Franco and his supporters to be a warning that only Hedilla should be obeyed and thus increased tension.Preston, Franco, p. 268 Believing that his power would be increased by maintaining Falangist independence, Hedilla refused to join the council of the new movement. However he overestimated his power and was arrested on April 25 and sentenced to death the following month. However, on the advice of Ramón Serrano Súñer, who feared losing the Falange, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and ultimately Hedilla would only serve four years.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 286 Mindful of the need to keep the Falangists onside, Franco appointed another 'Old Shirt', Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta, as leader of the Movement.De Blaye, Franco, p. 141 Autobiography controversy A controversial episode occurred towards the end of his life when Hedilla hired pro-Falange journalist Maximiano Garcia Venero to write his memoirs. The volume that they produced gave a somewhat critical interpretation of Franco during the civil war and, under pressure from the government, Hedilla decided against publishing. Garcia Venero then sought to have the volume published outside Spain by the leftist Ruedo Ibérico, a publisher controlled by the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) and the book appeared in 1967 under the title La Falange en la guerra de España: la Unificación y Hedilla. However given that the publisher was avowedly left-wing a companion volume by Herbert R. Southworth, highly critical of Hedilla, appeared simultaneously. Garcia Venero and his subject fell out over the issue with Hedilla bringing a lawsuit and the writer publishing a new book in Spain in 1970 that was much more critical of Hedilla. By 1972 Hedilla's heirs, who gained ownership of the original manuscripts in the court case, were allowed to publish it and other writings under the title Testamento politico de Manuel Hedilla.Stanley G.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is currently open to the public.  Style  Mount Harmon is an 18th-century brick mansion built by Sidney George around 1788. It features a central door with a scrolled pediment and pineapple keystone supported by Ionic pilasters. In the late 1920s a frame wing was built on the south gable.  History  The Mount Harmon Plantation estate and nature preserve covers some adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay, on a peninsula by the north shore of the Sassafras River. The plantation was created in 1651 as a land grant from Lord Baltimore to Godfrey Harmon. From 1760 to 1810 Mount Harmon flourished as a tobacco plantation owned by the Louttit and George families. Mount Harmon eventually fell out of family hands and into disrepair. In 1963, Marguerite duPont de Villiers Boden, a direct descendant of the Louttits and Georges, rescued the plantation, restoring the Colonial Kitchen and Manor House. Mrs. Boden filled the house with 18th-century antiques, and restored the Tobacco Prize House as a reminder of the plantation's days as a tobacco shipping center for the Sassafras River area. After Mrs. Boden's death, her daughter Kip Kelso Boden Crist ensured the plantation's future by forming Friends of Mount Harmon, Inc.  Friends of Mount Harmon  Today, the Friends of Mount Harmon (FOMH), almost all volunteers, preserve and interpret the plantation for the education and enjoyment of its visitors. FOMH conducts house and kitchen tours, hosts Colonial picnics, Yuletide tours, and special events, as well as operating educational programs for schools and maintain nature trails that wind around the property. Mount Harmon gives water access to canoes, kayaks, and boats. The formal boxwood garden is used for weddings, and the spacious Manor House grounds are open for festive events and corporate meetings.

He is known as the founder of the Opportunity Asset Management and for being at the centre of various corruption scandals in Brazil. Career In the late 1990s, Dantas was a fund manager for Citigroup and a key figure in the privatization of the telecoms sector. His company controlled Brasil Telecom Participacoes, then one of the country's largest telecoms groups, together with Citigroup (C.N) and Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI). The Opportunity led an international private sector partnership that bought up a large chunk of the Brazilian telecoms sector in 1997, when this sector was privatized. =Operation Satyagraha= In July 2008, several TrueCrypt-encrypted hard drives were seized from Daniel Dantas, who was suspected of financial crimes. The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried for five months (without success) to obtain access to his TrueCrypt-protected disks, after which they enlisted the help of the FBI. On June 7, 2011 the National Council of Justice (CNJ) unanimously recognized that Judge Fausto de Sanctis, at the time the head judge of the 6th Criminal Court of São Paulo, intentionally disobeyed the orders of the Federal Supreme Court (STF), when he ordered the detention of Daniel Dantas in Operation Satyagraha. The judges of the CNJ followed the vote of reporting Judge Morgana Richa, who determined that De Sanctis's conduct is incompatible with that of a judge, and that he would only escape proper punishment through the lack of a legal provision. Also on 7 June 2011, the Higher Court of Justice (STJ) accepted the opinion of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office and voided the criminal action originating from Operation Satyagraha, for its irregularities. According to the President of the 5th Bench of the Higher Court of Justice, Jorge Mussi, \\"the involvement of ABIN (Brazilian Intelligence Agency) was demonstrated in a document in which the Federal Police ordered the internal investigation of irregularities in the operation\\". The scheme of informal investigation set up in Satyagraha represents, for Mussi, \\"a model of investigation more suited to the secret police, beyond the most basic rules of the Democratic State of Law\\". In 2016, he was found, on this technicality, to be innocent from all charges related to Operation Satyagraha and frozen bank accounts were released. =Acquittal= Dantas was arrested twice by Protógenes Queiroz, a police officer who investigated Daniel Dantas's involvement in Operation Satyagraha, in early July 2008, but each time was released almost immediately. President of the Supreme Court Gilmar Mendes gave Dantas two habeas corpus rulings in less than two days. On December 2, 2008, Daniel Dantas was convicted of an attempt to bribe police officers related to an investigation into money laundering. He appealed the conviction. Daniel Dantas was finally sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in December 2008 for attempting to bribe a police officer. On October 21, 2014, Protógenes Queiroz, a former police officer who commanded Satiagraha, was sentenced by the Supreme Federal Court (STF) and expelled from the Federal Police. Today, he is on the run in Switzerland and is being investigated for prevarication, corruption and crimes against the national financial system. On June 24, 2015, the STF ratified the decision of the Superior Court of Justice that annulled Satiagraha. On February 22, 2016, in the Criminal Appeal, the 5th Panel of the Federal Regional Court of the 3rd Division (TRF 3) ordered the filing of the criminal action related to the financial crimes charges in Operation Satiagraha. On the same date, the 5th Class of TRF 3 also acquitted Daniel Dantas of the crimes of corruption imputed under Operation Satiagraha. Over the past decade, AgroSB, the farming empire owned by the Opportunity group, co-founded by Daniel Dantas, has been accused of illegal deforestation, keeping workers in slave-like conditions, and spraying a community occupying one of its farms with pesticides.the guardian  References   External links  Brazilian bankers Living people 1954 births ","title":"Daniel Dantas (entrepreneur)"},{"id":"21154668","text":"Elisha Kirk House is a historic home located at Calvert, Cecil County, Maryland, United States.

Best known for introducing new themes and subject-matter into Australian art and being one of the first Australian artists to be influenced by Pop art, particularly British Pop artists like Peter Blake, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson and the formal strategies of the post-modernist R. B. Kitaj. Another major Influence was and remains the British painter Francis Bacon. He was an associate of Brett Whiteley and there was a likely mutual influence. Sansom has had a distinct influence on subsequent Australian art, paving the way for later notable artists such as Juan Davila and Howard Arkley. His work is represented by the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and the Mertz Collection. His paintings are eclectic, studded with allusions both historical, cultural and personal. There is something almost diaristic about his work, but its presentation is anything but linear and logical. Abiding themes are mortality, ageing, sexual identity, popular and youth culture and cinema. There is also a strong element of humour, iconoclasm and irony in his work, from their titles, such as \\"Art Can't Fart (for Rose Selavay)\\", \\"Four Wise Men Looking for God in Abstract Art\\", \\"Dr Fu Manchu's Death by Gyro\\" or \\"Ship of Fools (Hello sailor!)\\" to comic and grotesque figurative elements and their sometimes lurid but highly resolved colour schemes. On a technical level his paintings combine oils, enamels (both sprayed and applied with brush) and collaged elements from personal photographs to objects stuck on or painted over. Stylistically Sansom uses a wide array of painting techniques but signature devices include allowing earlier layers of paint to remain visible, hard-edge geometric shapes juxtaposed with playful, lyrical, more organic or atmospheric passages of paint and figurative \\"doodles\\", often at the margins of the paintings. Gareth Sansom, Bates Motel, 2011, oil, enamel, collage photographs on linen. Early career Sansom studied at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, (now RMIT University), from 1959 to 1964. He held his first solo exhibition in 1959 at Richman Gallery in Melbourne. He asked Arthur Boyd to open the exhibition and Boyd agreed. Boyd also purchased a painting from the show. After his studies at RMIT, two exhibitions were at South Yarra Gallery, in 1965 (from which the National Gallery of Victoria purchased the work, 'He Sees Himself'), and Gallery A, in 1966 (from which The National Collection - now Australian National Gallery - purchased the work 'Leaving that well known void'). In 1968 he painted 'The Great Democracy, where his influences can be readily discerned. (This painting is now in the collection of the Australian National Gallery, Canberra). During the 1970s, Sansom began to experiment with self- portrait photographs involving images of himself dressed as a woman. In particular Sansom developed a series of photographs in which he portrayed Hollywood film noir icons such as Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford. Two series of works on cardboard using these photographs as collaged items within graphic media and paint were shown at Warehouse Gallery, Melbourne, in 1975 and 1977. In 1978, RMIT Gallery presented a major survey of Sansom's paintings and graphic works covering the period 1964–1978. Sansom was head of painting at the VCA School of Art, prior to becoming Dean in 1986. Mid career In 1982, Sansom was a visiting artist at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and in 1985 he was Artist-in-Residence at The University of Melbourne. In 1991, Sansom represented Australia at the Indian Triennial held in New Delhi. At this event he exhibited watercolours made while he lived for six months in New Delhi, in 1989. His aim had been to make one watercolour per day during this period, using humble materials, but on archival paper. Many aspects of contemporary Indian life and culture infiltrated the modus operandi of these works. Back in Australia these watercolors were exhibited at Roslyn Oxley9Gallery in 1990 ('Out of India'), and at the Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne in 1991. From 1986 to 1991 Sansom was Dean of the School of Art at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA). In 1991 Sansom resigned from the VCA. Gareth Sansom, Skateboarding punk video shit, 2009, Oil and enamel on linen Recent career In 2005, a career survey of Sansom's work, titled \\"Welcome to my mind: Gareth Sansom, a study of selected works 1964-2005 \\", was held at the Ian Potter Gallery at The University of Melbourne. In 2008, Sansom won the John McCaughey Memorial Prize. The judge, Alex Baker, the National Gallery of Victoria's senior curator of contemporary art, said of Sansom's work: > \\"The balance between figuration and abstraction, the self-investigatory > aspect of the work, the psychedelic aspect, all really hit me as being very > much of the moment. I think younger artists should really look at this guy's > work to understand what's going on in contemporary painting.\\" Sansom stated recently that > \\"In my earlier days it was always firmly about being anti-intellectual and > beating my chest. It seems somewhat foolish now. Nowadays I am open to > anything that's going to make my paintings better. Where I had always relied > on spontaneity I've realised you have to raise the bar and part of that is > intellectually.\\" Sansom (now in his eighties) has recently returned to earlier themes in his paintings by inserting digital photographs of himself in various disguises using latex horror masks and realistic female masks, as well as incorporating latex prosthetics of female body parts; his aim being to create an uneasy tension between the literalness of the photographs and the painterliness within the paintings, which can veer wildly between abstraction and figuration. Sansom is married to the painter Christine Healy. He lives and works in Melbourne and Sorrento, and is currently represented by STATION Gallery, in Melbourne: the Milani Gallery in Brisbane, Queensland; and the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney, NSW. In 2016 the artist participated in the exhibition 'Magic Object' - Adelaide Biennial at the Art Gallery of South Australia.http://adelaidebiennial.com.au/2016/ He also featured in the important survey show of Australian painting, Painting, More Painting, mounted at ACCA (Australian Centre for Contemporary Art), Melbourne. Also in 2016, Sansom was included in Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA), Sydney. Also in 2016, Sansom was interviewed for the James C. Sourris AM Collection. Sansom spoke about his life, art practices and his success at winning the Hugh Williamson Prize; the McCaughey Memorial Prize; and the Dobell Prize for Drawing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_auEz3mstTA In October 2017, the artist was invited to speak at the seminar, 'Artist to Artist: Gareth Sansom', during which, he discussed his work as an artist, and his important and influential role as an art educator. This event was staged as part of 'ART150' at the Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne, Australia, which celebrated 150 years of art in Melbourne. In 2017–2018, the Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia staged a major retrospective of Sansom's work, 'Gareth Sansom: Transformer'. Over 130 works were featured in the exhibition, including many ground-breaking pieces that had not been previously seen in public. The exhibition comprised: suites of works on paper; photography; watercolours; collages; and paintings - including many works from the past 15 years. The show was opened by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, Sebastian Smee, whose essay about the show stated that Sansom had a lack of sentimentality about \\"our darker natures; for the parts of us that idle along during the day, purring harmlessly beneath the surface of our charming, careful, mildly-anxious social selves, but that intermittently growl, bark or stare inappropriately; that come out at night, and are liable to erupt in spasms of desire, violence and teeth-baring, and are tempted by self- annihilation.http://garethsansom.com.au/NGV-2017.php Art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald, John McDonald, wrote of the exhibition's: \\"sheer, crazed abundance. Part fun-house, part warehouse, the show is bursting with paintings, collages, photos, objects and memorabilia. There are veins of pure kitsch, grotesquerie, dark eroticism\\".https://www.johnmcdonald.net.au/2017/gareth-sansom-transformer/ In 2019, Sansom was included in the exhibition, Ways of Seeing: recent acquisitions from the collection, staged at the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide. In the same year, his work was showcased in Berlin, in the exhibition, STATION at Arndt Art Agency (formerly Arndt & Partner).

Giannini's aggressive banking approach at the Bank of America, he drove to San Francisco after completing his military service and approached Giannini for a job at the bank. Diners Club, the first major travel and entertainment charge card, had been introduced in 1950, and American Express and Carte Blanche followed in 1958, but all of these offerings had to have bills repaid in 30 days and were accepted by a limited number of vendors. By the mid-1950s, Williams was the senior vice president in charge of a group that had the unofficial task of creating the nation's first all-purpose credit card. Studying previous failures and analyzing the successes by Sears, Roebuck and Company and Mobil in offering credit to their customers, the team led by Williams conceived of a set of features — an 18% interest rate applied after a 25-day grace period, credit limits and floor limits — that became the standards for the credit card industry since.Oliver, Myrna of the Los Angeles Times. \\"J.P. Williams, who developed first bank credit card, dies at 88\\", The Seattle Times, November 30, 2003. Accessed January 18, 2009. In 1958 the bank sent 60,000 BankAmericard offers to residents of Fresno, California, followed by Bakersfield, California with two million more offers sent statewide in the subsequent 15 months, marking what was called by The New York Times as \\"the official dawn of the bank credit card\\". The cards had preapproved credit lines ranging from US$300 to US$500 and floor limits of US$25 to US$100. Resentment from merchants and customer delinquencies started almost immediately, and Williams left Bank of America two months before the bank's statewide rollout was complete. The bank lost almost US$9 million in just over a year after the cards were introduced. During the 1962 New York City newspaper strike, Williams published The New York Standard, one of several alternative newspapers that were published during the 114-day strike that hit the city's major newspapers. He formed the Uni-Serve Corporation in 1962 and bought the credit card operations from Chase Manhattan Bank for US$9 million, the value of the unit's unpaid billings. Uni- Serve was sold to American Express in 1965, with Williams remaining as president of the unit until 1966 and as the unit's chairman until 1968.

Pratt asks where Neela is and the soldier tells him that she's not coming. Kerry is called up to a meeting with Anspaugh to discuss the situation with Clemente. She's surprised to find that their words are being recorded. Anspaugh wants to know why Kerry hired Clemente in the first place after his troubled history and she defends her actions. Anspaugh says the hospital is facing a malpractice suit by a patient that could be very costly. Kerry notes that Luka was in charge of the ER when everything started going wrong and Anspaugh notes that people aren't very happy with Luka's work either. He asks Kerry if she is happy with it and she reluctantly supports him saying \\"he's done the best with the resources he's had\\". At Luka's apartment Abby wakes up to the sound of Croatian muttering in another room. She follows the sound and finds Luka assembling a crib for the baby. Amused she tries to articulate her feelings for Luka. He takes this as a sign that she is ready for commitment and suggests that they get married. Later in a trauma Luka is giving Abby frosty looks. She calls him on this and he admits he's annoyed because she didn't give him the answer he was hoping for. He asks if they love each other and she admits that they do but she doesn't want to rush into anything like she did with her first marriage. Their discussion is put on hold by a patient needing Abby and Kerry wanting to talk to Luka. Kerry tells Luka about her meeting with Anspaugh. Luka notes that he wasn't chief when Clemente was hired and asks if he's getting blamed for not firing him sooner. Kerry is vague but from this non-answer Luka can see that his job might be in jeopardy. Meanwhile, it's Morris' last day in the ER before he leaves to work for a drug company and he's refusing to treat half of the patients that come in as he thinks he deserves special treatment. He also is trying to keep a video diary to remind him of his time at County and is shoving a camera into people's faces and getting them to say complimentary things about him. Once the staff tire of this he starts in on the patients – prompting them what to say. One of the patients Morris rejects is a little boy called Timmy who is dressed as a strawberry. Jerry tries to comfort the boy while he waits for another doctor. Pratt gets to Neela's apartment and begs her to go to the funeral. She admits that she's not ready to say goodbye to him yet but eventually consents to come. In the limo the soldier goes over the program of events including the full military honors that Michael will be given. Neela isn't keen but Pratt gently says that Michael would have probably liked it. Sam is given the task of showing EMT trainee Mary around the ER and letting her perform minor procedures such as taking a BP. She quickly becomes irritated by Mary's lack of knowledge as do the other staff, especially when she claims to know CPR and then performs it incorrectly. Luka throws her out of the exam room then later sympathizes with Sam over her predicament which only gets worse when Steve and another prisoner are brought into the ER for injuries sustained while fighting. Morris again opts out on the patients, instead turfing them to Ray. The second prisoner is called Rafe and is suffering from head injuries. Steve has ripped stitches from his appendectomy (see episode No Place To Hide). Rafe blames Steve for the fight. The two prisoners are accompanied by correctional officers. When Sam hears about Steve being in she goes to see. She speaks with Rafe who talks Steve down. Mary's skills seem to be improving though as she takes a correct BP. Sam gathers her courage and finally goes to see Steve. She starts to treat his wound, not noticing Mary in the other room knocking out the officer looking after Rafe with a chloroform-soaked rag. While Sam chats with Steve, Mary unlocks Rafe and the prisoner dresses up in the officer's clothes. At the funeral Neela and the other mourners flinch at the twenty-one gun salute. Neela remembers the good and bad times with Michael (see episodes The Student, Where There's Smoke, Two Ships and Split Decisions). Afterwards at the wake Michael's father starts talking about the 'mind of a warrior' being constantly prepared for death. Neela gives him Michael's medals and when he tries to give them back to her she rounds on him and accuses him of persuading Michael to go back to Iraq for no good reason. She says that his father should have made him stay simply because he loved him, not sent him away for a false sense of duty. Sam is treating Steve in the suture room when Mary walks and points a gun at the other guard. Rafe follows her, also with a gun. Sam asks what they're doing as they knock out the other officer and unlock Steve. They are escaping. Steve says that his newfound religious faith convinced him that everything would be right in his life if he got his family back. Abby treats an elderly man while two elderly lady friends watch. They say he disappeared from the nursing home but they found him through the power of prayer. They say they'd like to get out of the ER as soon as possible as they sense something bad is coming. They ask Abby if her baby is okay. She responds that it is but the question worries her. They ask Abby if she is religious and when they guess she is not they call her brave for having a child in a bad world without believing in God. At the admit area Luka hears that Steve has been brought in to the ER and that Sam is treating him. He goes to see if she needs any help. When he gets to the suture room that Steve was being treated in he finds the door locked. He knocks and inside they freeze. He demands to be let in and Mary tells him to wait just a moment. Luka bangs on the door and they let him in. When Luka sees what's going on a struggle ensues. Mary stabs Luka in the back with a syringe full of vecuronium bromide. This causes him to collapse and stop breathing, paralysed. Steve is now anxious for them to leave but Sam has to intubate Luka as he will not be able to breathe for another half-hour. Steve tells Mary to go outside and drive the prison van up to the exit door. Mary stops to exchange a passionate kiss with Rafe, indicating they are together. Mary then leaves the suture room but Abby approaches her, looking for the sonosite. Mary tells her she doesn't think it's in there. Abby attempts to sidestep Mary to enter the suture room but Mary stops her. Abby becomes suspicious and asks if there is something going on in there and Mary tells her they're about to do an intubation. Abby asks Mary if Kovac is performing the intubation and Mary tells her that Kovac has gone to the place they do the \\"head thingy.\\" Abby walks around her and approaches the suture room, asking if \\"the head thingy\\" was to mean \\"CT.\\" In a panic to distract Abby, Mary acts confused, asking \\"The what?\\" Abby turns back to face Mary, pushing open the door several inches and asks if she meant to say \\"CT\\" just as Rafe raises a gun, positioning it to be directly in her face when she turns back to enter the room. Defeated, Mary confirms she meant Kovac had gone to CT, just as Abby remembers she had last seen the sonosite in exam 3. Abby walks away and the door falls closed, leaving Abby oblivious to the gun formerly just inches away as she narrowly avoided disaster. Sam wants to help Luka and tells them they do not want to be murderers. They let Sam do it but she is nervous and shaking and it takes her a while. Sam tubes Luka with the help of Steve and starts to squeeze in air. His eyes flutter and for the moment he is okay. For the criminals this means that it's time to go. They grab Sam and drag her away despite her protests that Luka still needs help. Mary goes to fetch the van giving Rafe a kiss to indicate they are together. Steve and Rafe hide their guns and Steve sits in a wheelchair. Sam tells them they can stop this now but they ignore her. She wheels the chair through the ER, Rafe following behind dressed as an officer. Just before they exit Morris stops them because some police officers have arrived looking for a patient that Sam treated. Sam tries to hint at Morris that something is wrong but he doesn't get it. As they are leaving Abby, who is at the admit desk, asks Sam if everything is okay. She replies that everything is but calls Abby 'Abigail'. Abby knows that there is something wrong and tells the police officers to call them back from the waiting room. When they do Steve stands up and Rafe turns and the two of them start shooting at everything in sight. Broken glass and bullets fly everywhere. Jerry pushes the little boy Timmy to the ground. Abby is knocked over. A police officer is shot and patients and staff alike try to get away from the danger. Rafe and Steve turn and, dragging Sam with them, exit to the ambulance bay where Mary has brought a van. They fire a few warning shots and the people in the street around them scatter. Sam begs to be let go, telling Steve to think of their son Alex. He already has. He opens up the van to reveal Alex tied up in the back. Sam jumps in and the criminals follow her, screeching away. In the ER the staff get to action organizing the wounded. Abby has a cut on her head but otherwise appears fine. The police officer who was shot needs treatment. Jerry is still lying on the floor. The staff roll him over to find that he's been shot through the chest. They take him to the trauma rooms and start working on him. Neela sits at Michael's graveside again. Pratt gets a call from the ER but he ignores it. Neela asks if this is something that she will never get over. Pratt tells her that she will get over it and manage to lead a good life. Pratt gets another call from the ER. Sam and Alex sit in the back of the van as they speed down the highway. Rafe and Steve are panicking now as the police chase them. Sam notes that they probably killed some of her friends and tries to get them to stop but they ignore her and drive on. In the suture room Luka is handcuffed to a gurney. He tries to rock it and get it to move but doesn't have much success. In the trauma room Morris, Ray and Abby work hard on Jerry, whose condition is slowly deteriorating. Abby starts to feel dizzy but puts this down to the bump on the head she received. Kerry arrives, angry that no one called her sooner, and starts to get to work. Abby goes searching in the empty trauma room for a piece of equipment and again starts to feel dizzy. Luka sees her through the window and again starts to rock the gurney to try to get her attention. Abby doubles over with pain. She draws a hand out from between her legs and it is covered in blood. She sways again then collapses on the floor, unconscious. Luka seeing this, starts to fight hard against the cuffs but there is nothing he can do. Abby lies alone on the floor of the empty trauma room.

The band mixes genres such as rock, funk, jazz, jive, blues, surf, rhythm and blues, reggae, rockabilly, rap, and psychedelic. Their sound has also been described as \\"equal parts Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, bizarre electronica, creepy hip hop and in-your-face gonzo rock\\". Gypsy jazz has been used in description of the band while frontman Godforbid describes the band's music as \\"fringe pop\\". History The band was founded by Godforbid and Jeremy Page. Predating the band's existence, they were both members of the hip hop group Alaskan Fishermen, along with Thirstin' Howl III and Father Time. That Handsome Devil released their first single \\"Dating Tips\\" in 2004, which featured the songs \\"Dating Tips\\", \\"How to Get Money\\", and \\"Don't Go\\". In 2006, the band released their eponymous debut EP That Handsome Devil, which included the single \\"Dating Tips\\". \\"Elephant Bones\\", the fourth track on the album, was featured as a bonus song in Guitar Hero II. Their first studio album, A City Dressed in Dynamite, was released in 2008 to several positive reviews, being praised by Amplifier Magazine as \\"a madcap musical frenzy as dizzying as it is dazzling\\". With music as stylistically varied as their last release, the album expanded on the band's themes of emptiness, drug addiction, materialism, and death, and featured their trademark of dated sound bites from the 1950s. A portion of \\"Mexico\\" was featured in the seventh episode of season four of Weeds, \\"Yes I Can\\", before A City Dressed in Dynamite was released. \\"Rob the Prez-O-Dent\\" was featured as a playable track in Rock Band 2. This, along with the appearance of \\"Elephant Bones\\" in Guitar Hero II, greatly increased their visibility. In 2009, their second EP, Enlightenment's For Suckers, was released. That Handsome Devil went on a national tour named \\"Hating New People\\" in the summer of 2010, where they sold small-print discs of previously unreleased singles and covers. In 2011, That Handsome Devil released their third album, The Heart Goes to Heaven, The Head Goes to Hell, to favorable reviews from fans and critics. The band supported the album with a tour and the launch of an independent website. The album was financed in part by a fundraising effort on project startup service Kickstarter, raising $6,013 after a month. That Handsome Devil announced their fourth EP, The Jungle Book, in 2012, available for free on their website. The album consists of covers of several songs from the original Disney movie. In September 2014, That Handsome Devil released the first single, \\"$=❤\\", from their forthcoming album. In November, The band released the album Drugs & Guns For Everyone on their YouTube channel.

(HBO) is an American multinational media and entertainment company operating as a unit of WarnerMedia Studios & Networks, and controlled by AT&T; through mass media and entertainment subsidiary WarnerMedia. Founded by Charles Dolan and based out of WarnerMedia's corporate headquarters at the 30 Hudson Yards complex in the West Side of Manhattan, its main properties include its namesake pay television network Home Box Office (HBO), sister service Cinemax, the HBO streaming service (a secondary HBO- branded service, HBO Max, is operated under an eponymous sister subsidiary of WarnerMedia that shares principal management with Home Box Office, Inc.), and HBO Films. It has also licensed or maintained ownership interests in international versions of HBO and Cinemax, most of which are managed by Home Box Office, Inc. through sister division WarnerMedia International. The company has achieved several pioneering innovations in the cable television industry, including its satellite uplink of HBO as the first television network in the world to transmit through that technology, and the development of original programming for pay television.  History  =Origins as Sterling Communications= Home Box Office, Inc.'s origins trace to December 1, 1965, when Charles Dolan—who had already done pioneering work in the commercial use of cables—was granted a franchise permit by the New York City Council to build a cable television system encompassing the Lower Manhattan section of New York City (traversing southward from 79th Street on the Upper East Side to 86th Street on the Upper West Side). Along with Dolan, TelePrompTer Corporation (which was assigned most of Upper Manhattan) and CATV Enterprises Inc. (which was assigned part of the city's Upper West Side, extending north of the Harlem River, and The Bronx's Riverdale neighborhood) were also awarded cable franchise permits on that date. Dolan's maiden television venture was Teleguide, a closed-circuit television system started by his initial company, Sterling Movies U.S.A., in June 1962; it distributed a schedule of tourist information, news, interview segments and feature interstitials to hotels, and by 1964, apartment buildings and office buildings in the New York metropolitan area. Through Dolan's Sterling Information Services subsidiary, Manhattan Cable TV Services began limited cable service in September 1966. Manhattan Cable (renamed Sterling Manhattan Cable Television in January 1971) was the first urban underground cable television system to operate in the United States. Rather than string up cable on telephone poles or use microwave antennas to receive the signals, Sterling had laid new cable lines beneath the streets of and into buildings throughout Manhattan, and repurposed Teleguide's existing cable infrastructure for use by the new operation. Sterling's use of underground cables complied with a longstanding New York City Council ordinance—originally implemented to prevent broad-scale telephone and telegraph outages, after a severe blizzard affecting the Northeastern United States in March 1888 had caused widespread damage to above-ground utility lines in the area—requiring all electrical and telecommunication wiring to be laid underground to limit weather-related service disruptions, and because the multitude of tall buildings on Manhattan Island subjected television signals to reception impairments. Dolan curried the financial backing of Time-Life, Inc. (then the book publishing unit of Time Inc.), resulting in Manhattan Cable becoming one of its first cable system properties. Despite the investments from Time-Life's share of Sterling (initially 20% at the beginning of operations), Sterling Manhattan consistently lost money throughout its first six years of operation; the company incurred much of its debt from underground wiring expenses (costing as much as $300,000 per mile), and its difficulties attracting new subscribers to generate income (Manhattan Cable managed to receive only around 400 customers by 1967). On August 27, 1969, Sterling Communications consolidated ownership of the cable assets: it acquired Time-Life's 49% share in Sterling Manhattan, in exchange for stock and other assets worth $1.84 million. (Time-Life's interest in Sterling Communications concurrently increased from 25% to 44.5%.) Dolan was looking for a way to help his struggling cable company grow to become financially viable. In the summer of 1971, during a family vacation to France aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Dolan conceived \\"The Green Channel\\", a codenamed concept for a cable-originated television channel that would be distributed via Sterling Manhattan and other participating cable systems. The proposed service would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from the major Hollywood film studios and live sporting events, all presented without interruptions by advertising and sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers. Dolan wanted to offset the service's start-up costs by having Sterling enter into carriage agreements with other cable television providers to transmit and sell the service to their customers, and draw revenue from fees charged to subscribers who added the channel onto their existing cable service (which then consisted exclusively of local and imported broadcast stations). Dolan later presented his idea to management at Time-Life, who, despite the potential benefit to the company's cable assets, were initially hesitant to consider the \\"Green Channel\\" proposal. In the early 1970s, the cable television industry was not very profitable, and was under constant scrutiny from FCC regulators and the major broadcast television networks (CBS, NBC and ABC), who saw cable as a threat to their viability. Attempts to launch pay television services had been done on an experimental basis in the United States dating to 1951 (among them, Phonevision in New York City, Chicago and Hartford; SubscriberVision in New York City; Telemeter in Palm Springs, California; and Telemovies in Bartlesville, Oklahoma) with little to no success, muzzled by campaigns backed by movie theater chains and commercial broadcasters to assuage television viewers to the supposed threat of pay television to the movie industry and free-to-air television access, limited user interest, and FCC restrictions on the types of programming that could be offered to subscription services. Undeterred, Dolan managed to persuade Time- Life to assist him in backing the project. After the Federal Communications Commission ruled that local governments could not restrict the operation of subscription television services in cable franchise terms, in July 1971, Sterling Communications—now consisting of Sterling Manhattan; its Long Island- based sister system, Sterling Nassau Cable Television; production firm Allegro Films; and direct-to-cable programming firm Television Presentations Inc.—informed the FCC that it planned to operate a cable-originated pay television service. Because Sterling's New York City Council franchise grant specifically required FCC approval for that purpose, Time/Sterling filed an FCC request to authorize pay television operations. Sterling indicated that a subscription television operation would also help Sterling Manhattan fund its fledgling local origination channel, which had incurred $1 million in start-up debt on top of annual company operating losses of $250,000. On September 10, 1971, the FCC gave preemptive authorization to Time-Life and Sterling Manhattan Cable to begin a pay television operation. On November 2, 1971, Time Inc.'s board of directors approved the \\"Green Channel\\" proposal, agreeing to give Dolan a $150,000 development grant for the project. = Early history; spin-out from Sterling = HBO headquarters in New York City, United States, April 2017. The namesake Home Box Office (HBO) pay television network was founded by Dolan—as a joint venture between Sterling Communications and its co-partner, Time Life Broadcast Inc.—in 1972. The service—originally to have been called the \\"Sterling Cable Network\\", before Dolan and his development team settled on naming it \\" _H_ ome _B_ ox _O_ ffice\\", originally intended as a placeholder name to meet publishing deadlines for the service's announcement memorandum and research brochures—launched on November 8, 1972, over Teleservice Cable (now Service Electric)'s Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, system. Time Life originally planned for HBO to debut on a Teleservice system in Allentown, but, per an agreement with Teleservice president John Walson, moved the launch system to the company's Wilkes-Barre system to avoid blackouts of NBA games (specifically those featuring the Philadelphia 76ers, with which HBO was unable to materialize a television agreement to accompany its planned broadcasts of New York Knicks games) that were scheduled to air on the service. Programming on HBO initially consisted of theatrical films and event programming (much of which was sourced to the service through an agreement with Madison Square Garden that dated to 1969, and was extended to allow regional broadcasts one week before HBO launched), arranged in the form of a double feature, or a single movie presentation paired with either a sports or special event (often bridged by a short film or other interstitial content); by 1974, when the service began offering programming during the l concert specials and other music programs, daytime children's programs and various instructional series were added to the schedule. Originally headquartered from the Time-Life Building on Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) in Midtown Manhattan, HBO initially relayed its programming via a network of microwave relay towers throughout the Northeastern United States to participating cable systems carrying the channel; On February 28, 1973, Sterling Communications announced it would spin-out HBO and associated assets into Home Box Office, Inc., a new subsidiary created in accordance with the sale of 9% of Sterling's HBO equity to Time Inc. (expanding its controlling shares to around 75% of HBO's equity) and a $3-million direct investment. Sterling also raised Time's equity in the company to 66.4% in exchange for the added HBO stake, through the purchase of additional stock and a converted $6.4-million note obligation. Dolan—who reportedly had major disagreements with Time-Life management on policy issues, claims which the company denied—subsequently resigned as chief executive officer of Sterling Communications and Home Box Office, accepting a $675,000 buyout of a portion of his stock while remaining on the board of directors at both companies in the interim; Dolan used portions of the sale's proceeds to repurchase Time's share of the Sterling Nassau systems and to start the Long Island Cable Community Development Co. (the forerunner to Cablevision Systems Corporation, that would be combined with the Sterling/Cablevision systems on Long Island) as the system's parent company. Gerald M. Levin—an entertainment industry attorney previously with New York City-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who had been with Home Box Office since it began operations as its director of finance, and later as its vice president and director of programming—replaced Dolan as the company's president and CEO; by September, he was joined by Time Life vice president J. Richard Munro as chairman of Home Box Office as well as Time-Life Broadcast's other subsidiaries, Manhattan Cable Television and NBC affiliate WOTV (now WOOD-TV) in Grand Rapids, Michigan (which became the company's lone conventional broadcasting property, after Time sold its television station properties as it began expanding into cable system ownership). On May 9, 1973, reportedly because of high start-up and operating costs for HBO and other Sterling cable assets, Time announced it would sell its controlling share of Sterling to Warner Communications for $20 million. Time intended to convert the 260,000 convertible notes it held in Warner's cable television unit, Warner Cable Communications, into common stock shares totaling up to 20% in interest. Sterling would then maintain oversight of Home Box Office under Warner's purview. The Time-Warner cable deal was terminated on June 27, after both companies failed to reach a definitive agreement to sell HBO and the other Sterling subsidiaries to Warner; financial arrangements made between Sterling and the New York City Council as part of their 20-year noncompete franchise agreement were alleged to have curtailed the sale. On July 19, 1973, Time Inc. reached an agreement to purchase and assume financial liabilities of Sterling Communications for $6.2 million (including $3.1‐million in redeemed public debentures). Time completed its acquisition of Sterling on September 18, 1973, formally dissolving the Sterling holding company and transferring Home Box Office and Sterling Manhattan Cable to its Time-Life division. The \\"Sterling\\" name was subsequently removed from the Manhattan and Long Island systems, with the Manhattan unit being renamed \\"Manhattan Cable Television\\". (Time's purchase of Sterling was the subject of a $97-million class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 28, 1973, by 15 former Sterling stockholders who accused Time and its corporate board of \\"conspiracy\\" to depress the value of Sterling stock in order to \\"force\\" the sale at below market value \\"far less than its true value.\\") As the acquisition was being completed, the service had struggled to grow to complete viability: by October, it had around 8,000 subscribers and was carried on 13 cable systems in Pennsylvania and southern New York State with a combined 110,095 subscribers, and it was suffering from a significant churn rate as subscribers who found the channel's program scheduling repetitive, because of the limited allotment of movies outside of special events, decided to cancel their service. On April 11, 1975, Levin and Time-Life unveiled plans to distribute the HBO signal via satellite under a transponder leasing agreement with RCA Americom Communications, intending to distribute its programming to cable systems and multipoint distribution services throughout the United States. Levin reached an agreement to distribute the HBO satellite feed on eight UA-Columbia Cablevision systems in California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Arkansas and Washington State, and build earth station receivers to intercept and relay the signal to the UA-Columbia systems' headends. HBO also signed a $7.5-million agreement (including $6.5 million allocated by Levin) with RCA Americom to lease a transponder on the then-under construction Satcom I), which was expected to be launched at the end of 1975, for a five-year term. Cable television equipment manufacturer Scientific Atlanta (through a client arrangement with Transcommunications Corp.) also intended to build earth-based satellite transmitting stations for setup outside of HBO's Manhattan headquarters and at the headend sites of the client cable systems that reached agreements to receive the signal ahead of the satellite launch. HBO began continuously transmitting via satellite on September 30, 1975, for the broadcast of the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" heavyweight championship boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier from the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Philippines. The broadcast that marked the television industry innovation was received by UA-Columbia Cablevision's Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida, systems, and American Television and Communications Corporation's Jackson, Mississippi system, alongside systems already receiving HBO via microwave beforehand in the northeastern U.S. The service temporarily retransmitted its signal from transponder on Westar 1 for the first three months of satellite transmissions, before switching to Satcom I when that satellite commenced commercial operations on February 1, 1976. It also gradually turned around the fortunes of HBO: at the time Time-Life, Inc. bought the remaining interest of the channel in September 1973, HBO's subscribership amassed only 8,000 customers across 14 Pennsylvania cable systems and was hampered by significant churn rate as some subscribers cancelled their service because of the repetitive scheduling of programming. By 1980, HBO was carried on cable and MMDS providers in all 50 U.S. states, with more than three million subscribers nationwide. Other cable channels followed HBO's footsteps in satellite distribution; in December 1976, Atlanta superstation WTCG-TV—now WarnerMedia- owned basic cable service TBS, and owned by Ted Turner at the time it went national—became the first television broadcaster to transmit via satellite as a basic cable service. This, along with the CBN Satellite Service (now Freeform) launching by satellite in April 1977—pioneered the development of basic cable, using HBO's blueprint of utilizing satellite delivery for the cable television industry. In May 1976, Gerald Levin was promoted to chairman and CEO of Home Box Office Inc., succeeded as company president by Manhattan Cable president Nicholas \\"N.J.\\" Nicholas Jr.  Home Box Office v. FCC; acquisition of Telemation  The ability of Home Box Office and other pay television services to offer a wide array of content was challenged on March 20, 1975, when the Federal Communications Commission updated its pay-cable regulations to modify anti-siphoning regulations that further limited the operations of HBO and other movie- and sports-based cable services (including local and regional operations). Under the regulations, cable-originated services could not devote more than 90% of their programming schedule to theatrical motion pictures and sporting events, and could not broadcast movies released within three years of their initial theatrical exhibition. Specific sporting events (such as annual tournaments) could not be \\"siphoned off\\" by cable services if such events had been televised on broadcast television within the past five years, and regular season games involving major sports leagues was limited to allow a proportion of games to continue to be shown on broadcast television or else cable programmers would be required to limit their sports programming proportionately should over-the-air sports telecasts decline. On November 3, Home Box Office Inc., Manhattan Cable Television, five other cable television system operators (American Television and Communications Corp., Viacode, UA-Columbia Cablevision, Warner Cable Communications and TelePrompTer Corp.) and competing pay-cable programming operator Theatrevision filed a joint appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, alleging the rules violated antitrust statues by inhibiting competition, exceeded FCC authority and violated cable programmers' First Amendment rights by regulating their access to content. (Network executives, National Association of Broadcasters officials and other broadcast industry representatives also were critical of the rules as administrative record did not support FCC allegations of content \\"siphoning\\" by cable-originated services. NBC and ABC, however, requested re-consideration of an increase to the minimum period of exclusive broadcast exhibition of movies from two years to three.) Earlier in 1975, the film exhibition rules prevented HBO from licensing two 20th Century Fox films released well outside the two-year window, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sound of Music (1965). Though rules for movies and sports were tightened, the FCC conversely drafted relaxed rules limiting pay television services from airing a television series unless it has had no prior conventional television broadcast, suggesting allowing pay services to carry series not purchased by broadcast outlets, under contract to a local station in any market, not shown on broadcast television for at least three years or with 50 episodes or less to be available for pay syndication. However, cable programmers and the Motion Picture Association of America petitioned for the rules to be eliminated entirely. The initial joint appeal and a separate objections by the U.S. Department of Justice and Metromedia were consolidated by the Court of Appeals into Home Box Office v. Federal Communications Commission. On June 24, 1976, Home Box Office Inc. reached an in-principle agreement to purchase Telemation Program Services, a supplier of programming from individual program distributors to pay-cable systems. HBO sought Telemation to extend the channel's distribution to the 180,000 subscribers (across 40 cable systems) to which the company provided content distribution; theoretically, this would allow Telemation to accommodate a custom feed of HBO to a system owner that declined to offer the service (such as for objections to carry R-rated movies). (Telemation later merged with a separate program marketing unit formed in April 1979, HBO Program Services, in 1980.) On March 29, 1977, the District of Columbia Appeals Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in Home Box Office v. FCC, overturning cable television anti- siphoning rules. (Similar rules applying to over-the-air pay television were affirmed in the ruling.) The 105-page decision held that the FCC trespassed on the First Amendment rights of cable operators, pointing that cable bandwidth was not a scarce resource and therefore, was not subject to limitations affirmed in the Supreme Court's 1969 Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC ruling (which upheld equal time provisions in the Fairness Doctrine). The court applied the O'Brien test (determining the FCC had failed two of its four \\"prongs\\" or standards) and found that the degree of limitation of free speech imposed by the FCC was inadequate, \\"grossly overboard\\" and thereby \\"arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional\\" to the rights of pay-cable telecasters. The decision gave free rein for Home Box Office and other pay cable services to acquire movie and sports rights without restriction, opening the door for services like HBO to engage in library content agreements for older films and, more broadly, the ability of cable-originated services to acquire a broad spectrum of sporting events (albeit with league-determined protections to ensure events are distributed on both broadcast and cable networks). A subsequent appeal decision by the U.S. Supreme Court on October 3, 1977, affirmed the ruling by refusing to review the District of Columbia Appeals Court's overturning of the pay-cable rules. = Early expansion; challenges to indecency statutes = As the HBO television service was growing nationally, Time-Life efforted to develop companion pay services to sell to prospective subscribers, including existing HBO customers. Home Box Office's first attempt at a secondary service was Take 2, a movie channel marketed at a family audience that launched in April 1979. The \\"mini-pay\\" service (a smaller-scale pay television channel sold at a discounted rate) tried to cater to cable subscribers reluctant to subscribe to HBO because of its cost and potentially objectionable content in some programs. Take 2, however, was hampered by a slow subscriber and carriage growth, forcing Time-Life to shut down the channel in May 1980. HBO executives then decided to develop a lower-cost \\"maxi-pay\\" service: on May 18, 1980, Home Box Office Inc. announced during that year's National Cable Television Association Convention its plans to launch Cinemax, a companion movie channel designed as a direct competitor to The Movie Channel (then owned by Warner- Amex Satellite Entertainment, part-owned by WarnerMedia predecessor Warner Communications) initially focused on movies chosen for their appeal to select audience demographics. Cinemax was designed to complement HBO (designated as a higher-tier \\"foundation [premium] service\\"), and avoid difficulties associated with bundling multiple \\"foundation\\" pay services. Cinemax launched over 56 cable systems in the Eastern and Central Time Zones on August 1, 1980. (A West Coast feed for the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones launched on September 1.) Compared to Take 2, Cinemax experienced far greater success because it relied on classic feature films from the 1930s to the 1970s, mixed with some more recent films, incidentally benefiting from the limited headend channel capacity offered by cable systems and customer demand for uncut broadcasts of theatrical movies. HBO traditionally marketed Cinemax to cable operators for sale to subscribers as part of a singular premium bundle with HBO, available at a discount if electing to subscribe to both channels. As Cinemax evolved, it expanded into non-film programming content, including music specials, some limited original and acquired programming (such as SCTV Channel and Max Headroom) and, most notably, late-night softcore pornographic films and series; the adult programming—initially offered as part of the \\"Friday After Dark\\" block, eventually expanding to all seven nights by the start of the 1990s—became a key draw for Cinemax subscribers, and the main association with the channel in pop culture. Pornographic adult programming on began to be de-emphasized from the linear Cinemax and HBO Zone channels' late- night programming in 2011, as part of the former's refocusing toward its mainstream feature films and a then-emerging slate of original action series, and was removed entirely from Home Box Office's linear and on-demand platforms in 2018. The 1980s also saw HBO join three separate lawsuits concerning municipal and state-level statutes that would have legally prohibited cable systems from transmitting \\"indecent\\" content—specifically, programs that featured descriptions of or depicted \\"illicit\\" sexual acts and/or nudity—which Home Box Office Inc. and cable systems that challenged the laws saw as overbroad and in violation of the First Amendment, and would have precluded HBO and other pay television networks from airing programs containing material that may be considered inappropriate. Two of these involved statutes in Utah: HBO and four Utah cable systems sought a permanent injunction to a 1981 statute passed by the Utah State Legislature to restrict indecent cable program content, which was granted by the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah Judge Bruce S. Jenkins on November 17, 1981; the statute was declared unconstitutional as a violation of the First and 14th Amendments in a separate ruling by Jenkins on January 13, 1982. A second attempt at addressing obscene cable programming, the Cable Television Programming Decency Act, was declared unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds by Utah District Court Senior District Judge Aldon J. Anderson on April 10, 1985, in a case filed by HBO, Community Television of Utah and several viewer groups; a modified form of the statute was ruled as a violation of the First Amendment by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on September 10, 1985, and affirmed as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 23, 1987, formally asserting that the subscriber-based model of cable television precluded programming content from being regulated in the same manner as broadcast television. A separate city ordinance in Miami that would have allowed the revocation of Miami Cablevision (now operated by Comcast)'s franchise license for carrying programs that the city manager deemed \\"obscene or indecent\\" was struck down by Judge William Hoeveler of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on August 3, 1983 on the grounds outlined in Jenkins' ruling, and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on April 10, 1985. On September 27, 1984, Home Box Office Inc. announced it would acquire a 15% equity share in Black Entertainment Television (BET), which would be accumulated under a \\"contribution\\" arrangement in which BET will stop paying a monthly lease to the transponder that HBO had then leased to BET until the accumulated lease amount matches what the latter would have paid fellow minority shareholders Taft Television & Radio Company and Tele-Communications Inc. BET repurchased all of Time Warner's stock in April 1996 in a $58-million transaction. In 1985, the operations of Home Box Office Inc. were relocated to facilities on West 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue in the Bryant Park district of Midtown Manhattan. = Home video, production and television ventures =  Film and television production  Home Box Office, Inc. began diversifying its portfolio beyond cable television during the 1980s. In 1982, HBO entered into a joint venture with Columbia Pictures and CBS Theatrical Films to form Tri-Star Pictures (the hyphen in the name was removed in 1991), to pool resources to split the ever-growing costs of making feature films. The studio's first production, Kevin Costner-led The Natural, was released in 1984. Tri-Star entered into the television production business, in April 1987, with the formation of Tri-Star Television. Towards the second half of the decade, the partnership transitioned into a singularly owned entity: CBS sold its ownership stake in the studio in November 1985, followed by HBO/Time Inc. in December 1987. HBO transferred its venture shares to Columbia Pictures, which integrated Columbia and Tri-Star into the umbrella company Columbia Pictures Entertainment. (, TriStar operates exclusively as a film production arm of Sony Pictures Entertainment. Its television unit was merged with Columbia Pictures Television and joint venture studio Columbia TriStar Television in 2002 to form Sony Pictures Television). Film production for the HBO television service commenced in 1983, through the formation of HBO Premiere Films, which was originally developed to produce original made-for- cable movies and miniseries with higher budgets and production values compared to other television films. The film division began producing original movies for the network in 1983 with the debut of The Terry Fox Story, a biographical film on the amputee runner who embarked on a cross-country run across his home country of Canada that was cut short by the advanced-stage osteosarcoma that ended his life through associated complications soon afterward. Differing from most television films produced for cable television, most of the original movies produced by HBO have featured major film actors over the years, ranging from James Stewart to Michael Douglas. The unit—which would be rechristened HBO Pictures in 1984—expanded beyond its telefilm slate, which was scaled back, ventured into independent film production. When HBO Pictures was formed, HBO entered into a limited partnership with Thorn EMI to form Silver Screen Partners. The first L.P. of its kind to be developed for the financing of feature film production, Silver Screen released only seven films between 1983 and 1986—most of which were not commercial or critical successes, with the minor exception of the 1985 comedy film Volunteers. A secondary internal film production unit, HBO Showcase, was created in 1986 to focus primarily on high- quality drama productions. One of its productions, 1989's Age Old Friends, became the unit's first film to earn Primetime Emmy Awards, respectively for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Hume Cronyn) and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Vincent Gardenia). In January 1996, HBO Showcase was superseded by HBO NYC Productions, a New York-based studio focusing primarily on HBO original movies as well as occasional drama series productions for the network. Time Warner consolidated HBO Pictures and HBO NYC Productions into a singular unit, HBO Films, in October 1999; since then, the division has expanded into theatrical film productions distributed by sister company Warner Bros. Pictures and its subsidiaries, in addition to continuing to produce HBO's slate of original movies. In 1987, HBO entered into another limited partnership to create Cinema Plus L.P. The studios' most notable film is Ricochet (a co-production with Silver Pictures), with other titles produced throughout Cinema Plus' existence including Mom and Dad Save the World, Switch and Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. All of the films—none of which were critical or commercial successes—were released in 1991 and 1992, and were distributed by HBO sister company Warner Bros. Pictures. Home Box Office, Inc. entered into television production outside of the flagship HBO channel in 1988, with the formation of HBO Downtown Productions. In addition to handling the production of comedy specials for HBO, the channel produced program content for Comedy Central (such as Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist). A secondary television production unit, HBO Independent Productions (HIP), was formed in October 1990. The Los Angeles- based production company specialized in television series and specials for broadcast, cable and syndicated television as well as lower-budget theatrical films. Throughout its 16-year existence, HIP primarily produced sitcoms for broadcast television and basic cable networks (including Martin, Roc, The Ben Stiller Show and Everybody Loves Raymond).  Home video  During the early 1980s, HBO had an agreement deals with Vestron Video to distribute some of HBO's made-for-cable films (such as The Terry Fox Story). In November 1984, as the broader entertainment industry began to drop their objections to and begin releasing their films through the then-burgeoning home video marketplace, HBO signed a partnership with the home entertainment unit of Thorn EMI to form Thorn EMI/HBO Video to distribute independent films and HBO- produced programming.Billboard (December 1, 1984, page 6) Thorn EMI signed distribution agreements with various mid-level and independent film production companies (such as Orion Pictures and New Line Cinema) that did not have their own home video units. In August 1986, Cannon Films acquired Thorn EMI's interest in Thorn EMI/HBO Video, which Time Inc. subsequently renamed HBO/Cannon Video upon transferring partial ownership of the unit. HBO acquired Cannon's interest in the venture in April 1987, amid financial losses incurred by the film studio after an unsuccessful attempt at releasing a series of larger budget films that floundered in box office revenue; the unit was subsequently renamed HBO Video. Over time, HBO Video—which eventually became HBO Home Video in January 1994—shifted focus away from releasing films from independent studios to releasing HBO's catalog of original programs and films on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. In addition, HBO Video also entered into various licensing deals with distributors such as Congress Video, Goodtimes Home Video, and Video Treasure to distribute and re-issue HBO's content catalogs. The unit—renamed HBO Home Entertainment on September 5, 2009—transferred the manufacturing of physical products to Warner Home Video.  Expansion of television service  On April 1, 1986, HBO commenced test-marketing of a new mini-pay service, Festival, to six American Television and Communications Corporation systems. Festival was targeted at older cable subscribers who objected to violent and sexual content on other pay cable services, non-cable television viewers, and basic cable subscribers that had no existing premium service subscription. Festival ceased operations on December 31, 1988; HBO cited headend channel capacity limitations for the closure, as it prevented Festival from expanding its distribution. On January 2, 1989, Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax (\\"Spanish Selections from HBO and Cinemax\\"), a Spanish-language audio feed transmitted through, depending on the cable system affiliate, either an auxiliary second audio program channel (accessible through built-in and external multichannel audio decoders) or audio simulcasts via FM radio, launched. The service originally offered Spanish audio simulcasts of recent feature film releases from HBO and Cinemax's movie suppliers, and by Spring, added audio simulcasts of HBO's live boxing matches (except for certain events broadcast exclusively in Spanish on networks such as Galavisión). Selecciones was replaced by two dedicated Spanish feeds of the two services, HBO en Español and Cinemax en Español, on September 27, 1993; both channels acted as part-time simulcast feeds with added first-run Spanish-language movies (mostly from Mexico, Argentina and Spain), and Spanish dubs of HBO's non-sports-event original programming. = Time-Warner merger = On March 4, 1989, Warner Communications announced its intent to merge with Time Inc. for $14.9 billion in cash and stock. The merger underwent two unsuccessful efforts by Paramount Communications to block the merger via civil injunctions, wanting to thwart the Warner offer as Paramount was seeking to acquire Time in a hostile takeover bid. The Time Inc.-Warner Communications merger was completed on January 10, 1990, resulting in the consolidated entity becoming known as Time Warner. (Manhattan Cable Television would be integrated into Time Warner Cable—formed through a consolidation of the cable system assets of American Television and Communications [ATC], which Time acquired for $140 million in January 1978 and subsequently integrated with Manhattan Cable, and Warner Cable Communications—and would adopt its parent unit's identity in January 1993. Time Warner Cable would be spun-off from its namesake parent as an independent company in 2009, and later merged into Charter Communications in May 2016.) By the start of 1990, HBO served 17.3 million subscribers out of a cumulative 23.7 million subscribers covered between it and sister network Cinemax. On November 15, 1989, Home Box Office, Inc. launched The Comedy Channel, a comedy-centered basic cable channel featuring clips excerpted from stand-up comedy sets, comedic feature films and television series. The Comedy Channel's programming model was similar to the original format of MTV (which, ironically, was launched under WarnerMedia predecessor Warner Communications and American Express's media joint venture, Warner–Amex Satellite Entertainment). Its competitor was Viacom-owned Ha!: The TV Comedy Network, another startup comedy-oriented cable channel that was formally announced after The Comedy Channel and debuted on April 1, 1990, focusing on reruns of older network sitcoms. Both channels experienced difficulties gaining sufficient cable distribution (both Ha! and The Comedy Channel each had fewer than 10 million subscribers), and struggled to turn a profit, making them \\"prohibitively expensive\\" to operate independently. On December 18, 1989, Viacom and HBO reached an agreement to consolidate Ha! and The Comedy Channel into a single channel, CTV: The Comedy Network, which launched on April 1, 1991; its name was subsequently changed to Comedy Central on June 1 of that year, in order to limit confusion and potential trademark issues with the Canadian-based CTV Television Network. Time Warner/HBO exited the venture in April 2003, when Viacom bought out its 50% stake in Comedy Central for $1.23 billion. (, Comedy Central operates under the Domestic Media Networks unit of ViacomCBS.) On December 19, 1990, Home Box Office, Inc. announced the formation of TVKO (renamed HBO PPV in 2001 and HBO Boxing Pay- Per-View in 2013), a sports production unit—operated by Time Warner Sports, in conjunction with its HBO Sports unit—which distributed and organized marquee pay-per-view boxing events with the partnership of participating promoters. The announcement came as HBO secured an agreement with promoter Dan Duva to broadcast then-heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield's pay-cable and pay-per- view matches, which had been airing on Showtime since 1986. HBO announced it would fold HBO PPV on September 27, 2018, as part of the HBO television service's broader exit from boxing telecasts after 45 years, citing the influx of sports-based streaming services (such as DAZN and ESPN+) as well as other issues with promoters that hampered HBO's ability to acquire high- profile fight cards, declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among HBO's subscribers, and the network's efforts to place more focus around its scripted programming in the aftermath of its acquisition by WarnerMedia. In 1993, HBO purchased post-theatrical distribution rights for 48 films in development from upstart production company Savoy Pictures (co-founded by Victor A. Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman). Savoy Pictures never generated success with any of its feature film releases, and eventually folded in 1997. In 2005, HBO Films and New Line Cinema formed Picturehouse, a worldwide theatrical distribution company for high-quality independent films. The company, along with sister studio Warner Independent Pictures, was shut down in May 2008 as part of the consolidation of New Line with its sister unit Warner Bros. Entertainment. (Picturehouse CEO Bob Berney would later resurrect the studio as an independent entity in 2013, after purchasing the trademark rights from Time Warner.) On March 1, 1994, a partnership between Home Box Office, Inc. and Showtime Networks (parent of HBO rivals Showtime and The Movie Channel) implemented a cooperative content advisory system that was initially unveiled across HBO, Cinemax and the Showtime Networks properties that would provide specific content information for pay-cable subscribers to determine the suitability of a program for children. The development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in HBO and Cinemax’s respective program guides and those distributed by other participating premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing HBO and other services to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material). Labels are assigned to each program at the discretion of the participating service. A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented across HBO and the other participating pay services on June 10, 1994. On January 7, 1998, Time Warner announced it would immediately consolidate its C-band retail businesses, HBO Direct (a retail arm of HBO's direct-to-home operations that sold HBO, Cinemax and their respective multiplex packages as well as ancillary programming services) and Turner Home Satellite (THS) (which handled C-band, direct- broadcast satellite and hospitality distribution of the Turner Broadcasting System cable networks—including TBS Superstation, CNN, CNN Headline News, CNN International, TNT, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies—and until the promotion's folding in 2001, World Championship Wrestling [WCW] pay-per-view events), into a singular retail unit under Home Box Office Inc. On October 15, 2014, Home Box Office, Inc. announced it would launch an over-the-top (OTT) subscription streaming service in the United States in 2015, which would be marketed directly to cord cutters (consumers who primarily use streaming video services rather than watch television via a cable or satellite subscription) and competing with services such as Netflix.HBO Now formally lauunched on April 7, 2015, initially retailing only to Apple TV and iOS devices under a three-month exclusivity agreement. The service is similar to HBO Go, a TV Everywhere streaming platform that launched on February 18, 2010, and is marketed exclusively to existing HBO linear subscribers through a television provider. Under WarnerMedia stewardship, on October 10, 2018, the company announced plans for a new OTT platform combining programming from HBO with content from various other WarnerMedia properties, including Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Television, and the WarnerMedia Entertainment- and Warner Bros. Entertainment-operated basic cable networks previously owned by the Turner Broadcasting System. The service—announced as HBO Max on July 9, 2019, and operating under WarnerMedia Direct, making it one of two HBO-branded properties (alongside HBO Home Entertainment) not to operate under the Home Box Office, Inc. umbrella—was developed under a separate infrastructure from HBO Go and HBO Now, and existing subscribers were offered to transfer subscriptions to HBO Max following its May 27, 2020 launch. Although the two existing platforms continue to be sold, WarnerMedia began phasing out HBO Now on participating digital platforms with the launch of HBO Max, which utilizes a similar design interface as HBO Now for its Apple and Android apps. = Acquisition by AT&T; = On October 22, 2016, AT&T; disclosed an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion, including assumed debt held by the latter company. The merger would bring Time Warner's various media properties, including Home Box Office, Inc., under the same corporate umbrella as AT&T;'s telecommunications holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV and IPTV/broadband provider AT&T; U-verse. Time Warner shareholders approved the merger on February 15, 2017. On November 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against AT&T; and Time Warner in an attempt to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction. U.S. clearance of the proposed merger—which had already received approval from European, Mexican, Chilean and Brazilian regulatory authorities—was affirmed by court ruling on June 12, 2018, after District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T;, and dismissed antitrust claims asserted in the DOJ's lawsuit. The merger closed two days later on June 14, 2018, with Time Warner becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T;, which renamed the unit WarnerMedia. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington unanimously upheld the lower court's ruling in favor of AT&T; on February 26, 2019. In August 2017, as part of their co-production deal with the studio, HBO and Sky acquired minority equity interests in British television production company Bad Wolf (producer of the HBO miniseries The Night Of). On February 28, 2019, Richard Plepler stepped down from his position as CEO of Home Box Office, Inc., after a collective 27-year tenure at HBO and twelve years as head of the network and its parent unit. The New York Times reported that Plepler \\"found he had less autonomy after the merger.\\" On March 4 of that year, AT&T; announced a major reorganization of WarnerMedia's assets, dividing WarnerMedia's television properties among three corporate divisions. Home Box Office, Inc. (encompassing HBO, Cinemax, and their respective wholly owned international channels and streaming services) was reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment, placing it under the same umbrella as sister basic cable networks TBS, TNT and TruTV (which were formerly part of the dissolved Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary), and under the leadership of former NBC and Showtime executive Bob Greenblatt. However, Home Box Office, Inc. otherwise operates as an autonomous subsidiary within the WarnerMedia Entertainment umbrella. (Other former Turner assets were split between two other new subsidiaries: WarnerMedia News & Sports, which oversees CNN and its sister networks, Turner Sports and management operations for NBA TV, and Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics, a unit of Warner Bros. that oversees such networks as Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies.) On May 8, 2019, as part of a broader reorganization that also brought HBO Enterprises and programming distribution for Turner Entertainment under the division, HBO parent WarnerMedia announced that HBO Home Entertainment would be transferred from Home Box Office, Inc./WarnerMedia Entertainment to Warner Bros. Worldwide Home Entertainment and Games. On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia restructured several of its units in a major corporate revamp that resulted in Home Box Office, Inc. and all other WarnerMedia Entertainment assets being consolidated with Warner Bros. Entertainment to form WarnerMedia Studios & Networks Group. HBO/Cinemax President of Programming Casey Bloys—who has been with Home Box Office, Inc. since 2004 (as director of development at HBO Independent Productions), and was eventually elevated to programming president in May 2016—added oversight of HBO Max and WarnerMedia's basic cable networks to his purview. (The restructuring also resulted in the three former Turner networks reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment being brought back under the same umbrella as sister networks Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies.) Among the around 800 employees whose positions were eliminated as part of the changes, the restructuring resulted in the layoffs of around 150 Home Box Office, Inc. employees.

He served as the French Minister of Information from 1941 to 1944. Early years Marion joined the French Communist Party in 1922 and wrote for L'Humanité as well as being elected to the party's central committee in 1926. After a spell in Moscow working for Comintern he left the Communist Party to join the more moderate Socialist Republican Union, which counted Marcel Déat amongst its membership, in 1929. He switched his allegiance to the Parti Populaire Français (PPF) in 1936.Robert Soucy, French Fascism: The Second Wave 1933-1933, Yale University Press, 1995 p. 231 Despite his political origins Marion was quoted as saying that the PPF would ally itself with the Devil and his grandmother in order to defeat communism.Soucy, French Fascism, p. 228 In 1938 he published the Programme of the PPF, a document that defended capitalism as well as endorsing corporatism.Soucy, French Fascism, p. 232 Marion was widely associated with the more moderate tendency within the PPF, which emphasised anti-communism above all, as opposed to the openly fascist tendency loyal to Pierre Drieu La Rochelle.Malcolm Anderson, Conservative Politics in France, Allen & Unwin, 1974, p. 218 He also wrote for a number of right-wing journals, including Jean Luchaire's Notre Temps.W. Fortescue, The Third Republic in France, 1870–1940 , 2000, p. 244 The same year he was one of a group of leading members who split from the PPF, feeling that Jacques Doriot had become too fulsome in his support for Adolf Hitler whilst also endorsing accusations that Doriot had been using his position to personally enrich himself.Soucy, French Fascism, p. 243 Marion was part of a loose group of leading members, unofficially led by Pierre Pucheu, who left the party together in early 1939.Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, France and the Nazi Threat: The Collapse of French Diplomacy, Enigma Books, 2004, p. 298 Vichy Reunited with Doriot under the Vichy regime, he served as Minister of Information from 1941 to 1944. His power grew as he was elected to the controlling committee of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and, along with Jacques Benoist-Méchin, pushed to Pierre Laval the idea that the group should become an official arm of the Vichy government.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 249 In his government office he also helped to create an Association of Friends of the Waffen SS, which played a central role in recruitment.J.G. Shields, 'Charlemagne's Crusaders: French Collaboration in Arms, 1941–1945', French Cultural Studies, 2007, 18, p. 93 He also attempted to use his position to politicise France's youth groups although in this endeavour he was unsuccessful.Charles Williams, Petain, 2005, p. 372 He remained in office until 1944 when a group of radicals briefly took power and he was replaced by Philippe Henriot.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 271 Marion returned to office soon afterwards following Henriot's death and served in his former position when the Vichy government was shifted to Belfort, although by then it was effectively powerless.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 276 Post- war Sentenced on 14 December 1948 to ten years in prison, he was pardoned in 1953 for medical reasons, and died of illness in 1954.

Early years Fraser was born on 11 November 1654 in the small town of Fraserburgh. His parents were Alexander Fraser, Master of Saltoun (c.1630-1682) and Lady Ann Kerr (1631–1658). When his grandfather, Alexander Fraser, 11th Lord Saltoun died on 11 August 1693, he became 12th Lord Saltoun of Abernethy and inherited the lands of Philorth as 11th Laird. Political life On the death of his grandfather in 1693, he also inherited a seat in the old Scottish Parliament. He formally took the seat in 1695, taking the Oath on 9 May of that year. He was key member of the 'Patriot Parliament'. One of the first major causes he fought was for the Scots rights to Darien in the 1700/01 Parliament. More significantly, he consistently voted against the Anglo-Scottish Union from 1705–1707. When the Alien Act was passed in England in 1705, Fraser voted against the Act for Union in the Scottish Parliament. His political colours were shown when on 15 November 1706 he supported the Earl Marischal's protest against any future link with England. The protest emphasised the view that with the death of an heirless Queen Anne, \\"no person can be designed a successor to the Crown of this realm\\". This was in direct contradiction with the first article of Union, and threatened to end the Regal Union of 1603 which would have severed all ties between the Kingdoms of Scotland and England. He ultimately voted against the final ratification of the Treaty in the Scottish Parliament on 16 January 1707. It has also been written that he was critical of the leadership of the Duke of Hamilton who led the opposition against the Acts of Union. In correspondence to his ally the Earl of Erroll, Fraser told of his belief that Hamilton was on the pay of the English Crown and doubted his real intentions. Given Hamilton's weak leadership and the benefits he reaped from the Union, historians take real note of Fraser's observation when his contemporaries did not. Given his political patriotism, there is little wonder that Fraser was initially arrested with the outbreak of the Jacobite rebellion in 1708. The warrant for his arrest was quickly dropped as he was gravely ill during the rebellion. There is little doubt that Fraser was a Jacobite sympathiser, not unlike the majority of his neighbouring Buchan Lords. The Fraser family were Episcopalian, and as such more inclined towards Jacobitism. In 1702 he supported the Episcopalians of Fraserburgh when the Presbyterian's attempted to take the High Church. Indeed, Fraser's wife was Margaret Sharp - was daughter of the infamous Dr. James Sharp, the Episcopal Archbishop of St. Andrews. Fraser's intentions are, however, ultimately unknown as he died before the rebellion of 1715. His wife was, after 1715, a known Jacobite sympathiser. Also his daughter, Henrietta Fraser (c.1698-1751) married John Gordon of Kinellar (1684–1764) - a Jacobite who entered Aberdeen with Earl Marischal to proclaim James Francis Edward Stuart as King James VIII. Fraser's son and successor, the 13th Lord Saltoun, did not come out for the Jacobites in 1715. Family, succession, death Fraser married Margaret Sharp 11 October 1683. She was the daughter of James Sharp, the Archbishop of St Andrews who was murdered by Scottish Covenanters on Magnus Muir in 1679. She survived Fraser, dying in 1734. They had seven children, *Alexander Fraser, 13th Lord Saltoun, married Lady Mary, daughter of George Gordon, 1st Earl of Aberdeen and Anne Lockhart. *William Fraser, of Fraserfield (1691–1727), married Anne Erskine, daughter of the David Erskine, 9th Earl of Buchan. *James Fraser of Lonmay (d.10 Aug 1729), married Lady Eleanor, daughter of Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres and Lady Margaret daughter of James Campbell, 2nd Earl of Loudoun.

It was built in Hamburg, in the HC Stülcken & Sohn shipyard, and launched on 25 June 1931. The construction cost 8,407,030 dinars, or 622,743 RM, and was funded in part by the Jadranska Guard maritime organization and in part by a loan taken from the Navy war reparations. On 16 July 1933, at 10.00 hours, the ship arrived in Tivat, and was commissioned into the Yugoslav Royal Navy on 19 August 1933, although the commissioning ceremony (which included a salute with cannons) was held only on 6 September at Split. The ceremony, which lasted three days, was attended by representatives of the political and military leadership from the whole country. The ship joined the Adriatic fleet on 25 June 1934. The vessel cruised several times in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic Ocean three times. During the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the ship was based at Boka, in the Đenovici. The ship commanded underwater weapons, and South sector of naval defense. The crew was not complete due to the requirements of Yugoslavia's other fleet, but there were enough crew members to carry out task-transport unit within the bay. Aircraft bombed the ship, but the crew several times opened fire on the low-flying aircraft. The crew remained on board until 17 April, when the destroyer was sunk. It was surrendered to the Italian navy, which used it as a training ship under the new name Marco Polo. After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, the ship lay abandoned in Venice and began to decay. Its equipment was looted and at the end of the war, it was barely floating and was serving as a bridge in one of the Venetian canals. At the request of the Yugoslav government and the ship was returned to Tivat. Immediately its restoration was begun in the Sava Kovačević marine-technical repair bureau. The crew was carefully chosen because a military enlistment lasted four years. Repairs began on 21 April 1947, and finished on 17 December 1948. The ship was ready for sailing, and served as part of the Vojnopomorskog school center in Divulje. With cruises began immediately and continued to the present day, being the right landing classroom. In 1956 and 1957, further general repairs and reconstruction of the ship were done in Tivat. The ship was completely gutted, and its complete inventory and a mast were replaced. The deck was dismantled, new equipment installed and new sails were added. Ten years later, the ship was completely rebuilt and modernized once more in Tivatin Arsenal. Jadran sailed to Barcelona in 2008 as part of an event organized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for the 2008 World Conservation Congress. It sailed with 20 other sailboats, ranging from schooners to catamarans, and two research vessels. Jadran is a barkentine with a displacement of 737 tons and a length of almost .

It is the second book featuring the J. W. Wells magic firm, and was published in 2004: J. W. Wells is inspired by the title character in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer. Plot summary  Paul Carpenter is the protagonist of the book. The book is summarized in the next book in the series Earth, Air, Fire, and Custard where Paul tells his uncle about what happened to him. So Paul told him all about it: how he'd got a job as a junior clerk with a firm called J. W. Wells & Co in the City, without knowing what it was they actually did; how it'd come as rather a shock to him when he found out that they were one of the top six firms of family and commercial magicians in the UK, specialising in the entertainment and media, mining and mineral resources, construction, dispute resolution, applied sorcery and pest-control sectors; how he'd almost immediately tried to resign, and how he'd found out a little while later that the reason why they wouldn't let him was that his parents had financed their early retirement to Florida by selling him to the partners of JWW, who wanted him because the knack of doing magic ran in his family to such an extent that it was inevitable that he'd have it too; how he'd briefly found true love with Sophie, the other junior clerk, shortly before she was abducted by Contessa Judy di Castel Bianco, the firm's entertainments and PR partner and hereditary Queen of the Fey, who permanently erased Sophie's feelings for Paul from her mind; how he'd learned scrying for mineral deposits from Mr Tanner, who was half-goblin on his mother's side, and heroism and dragonslaying from Ricky Wurmtoter, the pest-control partner, and a bit of applied sorcery from the younger Mr Wells (before the elder Mr Wells turned him into a photocopier); and how he'd just started learning spatio- temporal displacement theory with Theodorus Van Spee, former professor of classical witchcraft at the University of Leiden and inventor of the portable folding parking-space; oh, and how he'd died, twice (only the second time was an accident) and been put on deposit for a while in the firm's account at the Bank of the Dead.

It appears to have been constructed in two principal periods: the original -story section built between 1810 and 1820 of stuccoed stone and a -story rear kitchen wing; and two bays of stuccoed brick, with double parlors on the first story, and a one-story, glazed conservatory constructed between 1840 and 1850. The home features Greek Revival details. Also on the property are a 2-story stone smokehouse and tenant house, a small frame barn and corn house, a square frame privy with pyramidal roof, a carriage house, frame garage, and a large frame bank barn. Woodlands was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Significance: Woodlands is the estate and ancestral home of the Coudon family. The main dwelling house and adjoining outbuildings are situated on a hill overlooking the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. The house has lovely grounds, with landscaped gardens, boxwoods, and several old trees of merit. The mansion is one of the most important 19th century buildings in Cecil County. The house has endured moderate alterations, but still portrays pre-Civil War times more like the antebellum South than a border state. The Greek Revival period of the house is without equal in Cecil County. Another important feature of the property is the large number of original outbuildings still intact and continuing to perform as part of a working farm. The Coudon family has been an important family in Cecil County, particularly in the field of religion. The Reverend Joseph Coudon, father of the first Coudon to own Woodlands, served as rector to St. Mary Anne's Church in nearby North East, Maryland, from 1787 to 1792. The family has continued to worship at and support this church through the years. Joseph Coudon, Jr.'s son married the daughter of George P. Whitaker, owner of Principio Furnace, which created early ties between the two historic properties. Due to the long occupancy of Woodlands, a large amount of furniture and artwork have accumulated within the house.

Program history First Outlook and Your Weather Today premiered in 2000, taking significant portions of time out of Weather Center AM, which soon disappeared. At the time of launch, the original pair of meteorologists for First Outlook was Rick Griffin and Cheryl Lemke, along with Travel Analyst Dennis Smith. They were replaced by Nick Walker and Kim Perez (now Kim Cunningham), and Jennifer Carfagno became the Travel Analyst shortly thereafter. In May 2008, meteorologist Jeff Morrow joined the show, and Jennifer Carfagno became his new co-host after Kim Perez moved to Day Planner and Weekend Now in June of that year. At this point, the Travel Analyst position was eliminated, and Carfagno simply hosted the Travel segments from this point forward. The focus of First Outlook is on straightforward forecasts for business travelers and commuters. It includes several unique segments not found elsewhere on the network including the \\"Business Travel Desk\\", which regularly featured daily phone calls to the Federal Aviation Administration at 6:40 am Eastern Time, and, on Tuesdays and Thursdays \\"The Business Barometer\\" which focuses on the impact weather has on the business world. These segments were replaced by Wake Up with Al on July 20, 2009, when First Outlook was trimmed to two hours. On September 14, 2009, Scott Williams, who had filled in for Carfagno during her maternity leave that summer, became her permanent co-host while Jeff Morrow hosted various segments on Your Weather Today prior to moving to Weekend View. In 2010, Carfagno left the show to co-host Weekend View. In May 2012, Williams left First Outlook and the Weather Channel. He was replaced by Alex Wallace. In August 2012, Kyla Grogan joined Wallace as co-host of the show. Wallace and Grogan co-hosted from 4 am to 5:30 am ET, while Maria LaRosa hosted from 5:30 am to 6 am ET. Danielle Banks became a fill-in host. The show was accredited to being one of the few that followed a specific format, and showed mostly weather-related segments and forecasts. On November 12, 2012, First Outlook was replaced by First Forecast and On The Radar. First Forecast aired from 4 am to 5 am ET and On The Radar aired from 5 am to 5:30 am ET. The meteorologists hosting were Reynolds Wolf from Atlanta and Stephanie Abrams from New York. Wolf anchored both programs, while Abrams co-hosted On The Radar with Wolf. The 5:30 am to 6 am ET timeslot was replaced by an extended half-hour of Wake Up With Al. In July 2013, Wolf also became the new co-host for Weekend View, and thus Alex Wallace began hosting the programs on Mondays, Tuesdays, and alternating Wednesdays. Wolf hosted on alternating Wednesdays, and on Thursdays and Fridays. If there was a major weather event, First Forecast would start an hour early and air from 3 am to 5 am ET, and On The Radar would be pre-empted by an additional half-hour of Wake Up With Al. On November 12, 2013, exactly one year after both shows launched, First Forecast and On the Radar were replaced by the extended edition of Weather Center Live program, as part of the 2013 relaunch of the Weather Channel.

Apart from authoring numerous well-known devotional songs that propagate the Vaishnava (\\"faith\\"), Jagannatha Dasa wrote the in the native (six-line verse) metre and in the native (three-line verse) metre.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1764 He was also an accomplished scholar in the Sanskrit language. Overview For about a century after the death of Vadirajatirtha (1480–1600), a noted saint-poet, the Haridasa devotional cult which propagated the philosophy of Madhvacharya through lucid Kannada devotional songs, seemed to wane.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 200 The movement however revived in the 18th century under the guidance of Vijaya Dasa, this time centered on the holy town of Mantralayam in modern Andhra Pradesh and a large area covering the Raichur district in modern Karnataka.Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 883–884 The poetry written by these later day saints closely followed the style established by the 15th- and 16th-century saints of the Haridasa cadre. The Haridasa contribution to Hindu mysticism and the literature overall is similar to the contributions of the Alvars and Nayanmars of modern Tamil Nadu and that of the devotional saint-poets of Maharashtra and Gujarat.Sharma (2000), p. xxxii According to the scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash, about 300 saint-poets from this cadre enriched Kannada literature during the 18th and 19th centuries.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 201 Sainthood Legend has it that Jagannatha Dasa, whose birth name was Srinivasacharya (or Sinappa), was once invited by Vijaya Dasa, a noted Haridasa of the 18th century, to attend a religious ceremony at Manvi. The ceremony included dining with the devotees of Vijaya Dasa as well. Srinivasacharya excused himself from attending the ceremony on the pretext of suffering from severe stomach ache. Unfortunately, Srinivasacharya actually fell ill and developed severe stomach pains. Unable to find relief, Srinivasacharya sought the help of Vijaya Dasa who asked him to meet his disciple Gopala Dasa. Srinivasacharya visited Gopala Dasa and was cured by him. Repentant for his attitude towards the Haridasas, Srinivasacharya became a disciple of Gopala Dasa and took to the Haridasa fold. His poems are written with the (pen name, also called ) \\"Jagannatha Vittala\\".Sharma (2000), p. 522 These details are known from a song written by Jagananatha Dasa expressing his gratitide to Gopala Dasa and Vijaya Dasa. Kannada Writings The is a poem that treats on the philosophy of Madhvacharya and is considered his magnum opus and an important work by the school. Written in the native metre, it contains 32 chapters () comprising 988 stanzas. Later day scholars wrote ten commentaries on this work, including a Sanskrit commentary in 1862 (by Sankarsana Odeyaru), an indication of its superior literary content.Sharma (2000), p. 523 The , containing 1,200 pithy and proverbial poems of which 600 stanzas are available today, was written in the native metre, in a simple style, and is known to have been a consolation to his young widowed daughter.

Note the alphabet dial and pointer instead of the usual transmission key. The Beardslee Telegraph was a portable military telegraph developed by George Beardslee and adopted by Albert J. Myer to provide a mobile field telegraph system. The instrument was operated by hand- turned magnetos and did not require the heavy batteries needed in the civilian telegraphs. It included an alphabet dial and pointer instead of the usual key for transmission.Boatner p. 53 Limitations of the instrument were its short range of about ten miles due to insufficient power, slow transmission, and frequent lack of synchronization between sending and receiving sets. It was first used 24 May 1862 in the Peninsular campaign. Its first major triumph was during the Battle of Fredericksburg when it provided Burnside with communications across the river when fog and smoke had rendered the usual visual signal communication impossible.Boatner p. 54 Its popularity declined after this battle because it was often competing with the faster and more powerful commercial telegraph facilities. In November 1863, most of the equipment was discarded. Only the insulated field wire remained in military use. Operation The Beardslee telegraph operated using a magneto. The magnetos generated power to send electricity over the telegraph wire. The operator needed only to move the lever to a point on the dial representing the letter that he wished to send as part of his message. On the receiving end, the dial would move to the corresponding position on the dial.  Results  =Slow rate of transmission= The Beardslee was considered to be capable of only a slow rate of transmission. The dial consisted of thirty positions around the circumference. In the worst case of a double letter, all thirty positions must be traversed to send the second iteration. The advancing mechanism is an escapement very similar as would be found in a pendulum driven clock. Each advance would require two movements of the escapement. Each movement would advance the dial six degrees with twelve degrees per step being 360/30. Therefore 60 movements would be required. Because of these factors, nothing over 5 words per minute would have been achieved.

The name derives from its motherhouse, the Holy Saviour Monastery (; ), at Joun in Chouf near Sidon, Lebanon.  History  The order was founded in 1683 by Euthymios Saifi, bishop of Saida, with the aim of supporting pastoral and missionary activities by well-educated Melkite clergy, choosing for them the rule of Saint Basil. Saifi started to gather some monks in his episcopal residence, but it soon became too small for the community. In 1685 a miracle was reported during a pastoral visit of Euthymios Saifi to the village of Joun and thus some monks were sent to live in a farm near Joun. In 1710 Saifi succeeded in buying the farm and in 1711 the first building of the Holy Saviour monastery was erected. The order was cited by Pope Benedict XIV in 1743 in the encyclical Demandatam, and on 20 April 1751 the Pope sent them a letter urging them to fully follow the Byzantine rite rejecting the Latinizations introduced by Cyril Tanas against the wishes of Rome. Their specific rules (constitutions) were formally drafted and approved only in 1934. The Basilian Salvatorian Order soon became one of the two main religious orders of the Melkite Catholic Church. The other order was the Basilian Chouerite Order. According to their tradition, the Basilian Salvatorian Order had a more missionary aim, while the Basilian Chouerite Order was more contemplative. The Basilian Salvatorian Order recruited in the areas of Damascus and South Lebanon, while the Basilian Chouerite Order recruited in the areas of Aleppo, Homs, North Lebanon and Galilee. Attempts to unite these two orders in the 18th century failed: the opposition between them and between the different communities from which they recruit members is an important aspect to understand in the early history of the Melkite Catholic Church. Up to the first half of the 19th century, these two religious orders ran a large number of parishes and provided most of the bishops of the Church. With the increasing importance of the celibate diocesan priests since the patriarchate of Maximos III Mazloum, the religious orders lost some of their importance. The 19th century saw moments of difficulty in the life of the Basilian Salvatorian Order: the main problems were the lack of respect for the vow of poverty by some monks and the antagonism between the Damascene wing and the Lebanese wing. Reforms in the early years of the 20th century solved the issues.  Statistics  As of 31 December 2005, the Basilian Salvatorian Order had 18 monasteries and 114 monks, of which 97 are priests. In 2012, it had 11 houses left and 92 members (including 87 priests). In the United States it maintains a center in Methuen, Massachusetts. The Order serves the Church in four main areas: pastoral service in parishes, social service, ecumenical activity and dialog among different religious communities in Lebanon.  Superiors general   Prelates from the order  The Basilian Salvatorian Order has given more than sixty bishops and eight Patriarchs to the Melkite Church: Cyril VI Tanas, Athanasius IV Jawhar, Cyril VII Siaj, Agapius II Matar, Athanasius V Matar, Macarius IV Tawil, Clement Bahouth, and Gregory II Youssef; Patriarch emeritus Gregory III Laham is also a member of this Order.

Saimon is a native of Pohnpei and a national of the Federated States of Micronesia; he was living in Neosho at the time of the shootings. Witnesses reported that on 12 August 2007, Saimon entered the First Congregational Church in Neosho during Sunday services. There were over 50 people attending the services, most of them from Neosho's Micronesian community. Police said that Saimon carried two small-caliber handguns and a 9-millimeter semi-automatic pistol. After asking the children and some members of his own family to leave the room, Saimon began shooting at the other people in the church. Three people were killed: the pastor of the church and two deacons. Police suspected that he was specifically targeting church leaders. Saimon was arrested after approximately ten minutes of negotiations with the police. After his arrest, police announced that Saimon was also being charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old relative. The connection between the alleged sexual assault and the shooting incident was unclear. A preliminary hearing was held on 18 September 2007, where Saimon pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder, four counts of assault, one count of felonious restraint, and one count of armed criminal action. In September 2008, Saimon's trial was scheduled to begin in July 2009. Before the start of the trial, Saimon reversed his plea and pleaded guilty on March 29, 2009 to three counts of first-degree murder and four counts of first-degree assault. He also pleaded guilty to charges of statutory rape and statutory sodomy for a sexual assault on a 14-year-old girl two days before the August 12, 2007, shootings. In a deal with prosecutors, he avoided the death penalty, but was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, along with four 30-year sentences for the assaults and two seven-year sentences for the sex offenses. Saimon is imprisoned in Crossroads Correctional Center.

Myron Wyn Evans (May 26, 1950 - May 2, 2019), which claimed to unify general relativity, quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. The hypothesis was largely published in the journal Foundations of Physics Letters between 2003 and 2005. Several of Evans' central claims were later shown to be mathematically incorrect and, in 2008, the new editor of Foundations of Physics, Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft, published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis. Scope Earlier versions of the theory were called \\"O(3) electrodynamics\\". Evans claims that he is able to derive a generally covariant field equation for electromagnetism and gravity, similar to that derived by Mendel Sachs. Evans argues that Einstein's theory of general relativity does not take into account torsion, which is included in the Einstein–Cartan theory. In 1998 Evans founded the Alpha Institute for Advanced Studies (AIAS) to keep developing his theory. Its website collects papers on the theory and recent developments. The theory has been used to justify the motionless electromagnetic generator, a perpetual motion machine. In July 2017, Evans claimed (on his blog): \\"There is immediate international interest in [papers] UFT382 and UFT383, describing the new energy from spacetime (ES) circuits. There is also great interest in UFT364, the paper that describes the circuit [...] These circuits should be [...] developed into power stations.\\" In November 2017, Evans expanded on this point, as follows (again on his blog): \\"There is no reasonable doubt that the vacuum (or aether or spacetime) contains a source of inexhaustible, safe and clean energy. This source can be used in patented and replicated circuits such as those of [Evans' self-published papers] UFT311, UFT364, UFT382, and UFT383.\\" Reception Evans' claims are not accepted by the mainstream physics community. In an editorial note in Foundations of Physics the Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft discussed the \\"revolutionary paradigm switch in theoretical physics\\" promised by ECE theory. He concluded that activities in the subject \\"have remained limited to personal web pages and are absent from the standard electronic archives, while no reference to ECE theory can be spotted in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals\\". Several of the published contributions in this theory have been shown to be mathematically incorrect. In response to these demonstrations, 't Hooft's editorial note concludes, \\"Taking into account the findings of Bruhn, Hehl and Obukhhov, the discussion of ECE theory in the journal Foundations of Physics will be concluded herewith unless very good arguments are presented to resume the matter.\\" See also * List of topics characterized as pseudoscience References =Citations= =Books=   =Selected papers=       * =Criticism=    * =Other= * External links * Alpha Institute for Advanced Study (AIAS) — Myron Evans' website * About Dr. Evans — Myron Evans' blog * Myron W.

Some fluorotelomers and fluorotelomer-based compounds are a source of environmentally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acids such as PFOA and PFNA, while others are under extended investigation. Manufacture and use In the radical telomerization of fluorotelomer molecules, a variety of fluorinated alkenes can serve as unsaturated taxogens including tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and hexafluoropropene. However, many fluorotelomers, such as fluorotelomer alcohols, are fluorocarbon-based because they are synthesized from tetrafluoroethylene. In addition to alcohols, synthetic products include fluorotelomer iodides, olefins, and acrylate monomer. Polymerized acrylate from iodide and alcohol monomers represent >80% of the global manufacture and use of fluorotelomer-based products. Fluorotelomers are used in \\"fire-fighting foams, grease-resistant food packaging, leather protectants and stain- resistant carpeting and textiles.\\" Fluorotelomers are applied to food contact papers for their lipophobicity, making paper resistant to absorbing oil from fatty foods. Fluorotelomer coatings are used in microwave popcorn bags, fast food wrappers, candy wrappers, and pizza box liners. Environmental and health concerns Fluorotelomers that contain PFOA precursors can be metabolized into, and degrade to, PFOA, a persistent global contaminant found in people in the low-parts per billion range. Toxicologists estimate microwave popcorn, because of the high heat and coated bag, could account for about 20% of the PFOA levels measured in an individual consuming 10 bags a year if 1% of the fluorotelomers are metabolized to PFOA. PFOA is also formed as an unintended byproduct in the production of fluorotelomers, and is thus present in finished goods treated with fluorotelomers, including those intended for food contact. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) study, fluorotelomer-based paper coatings (which can be applied to food contact paper in the concentration range of 0.4%) were found to contain 88,000-160,000 parts per billion PFOA, while microwave popcorn bags contained 6-290 parts per billion PFOA. Industry and government actions In 2002 Burger King stopped using fluorotelomer coated boxes.Sanford Lewis. \\"The Shareholder’s Right To Know More - 2007 Update: DuPont’s Market and Liability Exposures Continue from PFOA and Related Issues\\" DuPont Shareholders For Fair Value, April 2007. (Accessed September 10, 2008). After more than a year of negotiating with \\"telomer makers Asahi Glass, Clariant, Daikin America, and DuPont to perform degradation studies on 13 of their products\\", the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and companies were not able to agree on terms. Thus, in late June 2004 the USEPA announced it would perform the degradation studies itself, with an expected time to complete the studies of 1 year. However, in a December 2005 deal with the USEPA over alleged withholdings, DuPont agreed to test nine of its fluorotelomer-based products' potential to break down into PFOA by 27 December 2008. Yet, in late December 2008, the USEPA and DuPont filed a joint motion stating that DuPont needed additional time to purify the products. USEPA lawyers extended the deadline by three years, to 27 December 2011, in the last month of the Bush Administration. In 2009 a 546-day USEPA study was published that estimated a degradation half-life for a fluorotelomer-based polymer in the range of 10-17 years. This estimate was much shorter than the half-life estimated by a DuPont study. Given this discrepancy, the USEPA undertook an extensive effort to develop methods for testing the degradation rate of commercial fluorotelomer-based polymers. The USEPA then carried out studies with two DuPont polymers in four soils and water using these methods. These new studies reported half-life ranges for these commercial fluorotelomer-based polymers of 33 to 112 years, roughly consistent with EPA's 2009 estimate.

He was born at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. He was the son of George Neville, 4th Baron Bergavenny and his wife Margaret, daughter of Hugh Fenn. He married Eleanor Windsor, daughter of Andrew Windsor, 1st Baron Windsor and Elizabeth Blount, before 6 April 1529. He was the brother of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny and the two of them became close to King Henry VIII (their distant cousin) and the Queen, Catherine of Aragon.Garrett Mattingly, Catherine of Aragon, p.160 Edward Neville was Esquire of the Body, and Keeper of Sewer (official overseeing service) to Henry VIII's household. He lived at Addington Park, Kent, England. On 25 September 1513 he was invested as a Knight and in 1516 held the offices of Master of the Hounds and Gentleman of the Privy Chamber. The Nevilles and their cousins the Courtenays supported Catherine of Aragon's marriage and for the Pope's authority in England, which alienated King Henry. But Edward seems to have kept the King's favour as late as 1535.Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn, p.261 He was Henry's Standard Bearer in 1531, and in 1534 he was Constable of Leeds Castle in Kent. But a few years later Henry turned against him. Early in 1538, Henry's chief minister Thomas Cromwell was warned that Edward Neville was secretly trying to obtain the estates of Moatenden Priory, which had been recently dissolved. Cromwell, after the death of the Earl of Northumberland in 1537, had marked its property for his own. After the Pilgrimage of Grace, many conservative nobles were accused of treason.Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn p.416 Neville was arrested on 3 November 1538, for conspiracy, along with his cousin Henry Pole. They were charged with high treason for conspiracy with Henry's exiled brother, Cardinal Reginald Pole: \\"devising to maintain, promote, and advance [Cardinal Pole], late Dean of Exeter, enemy of the King, beyond the sea, and to deprive the King.\\" Neville was sent to the Tower, tried at Westminster, and beheaded on 8 December at Tower Hill. A patent was issued to Cromwell confirming his estate, possession and interest in the site of the late priory, of Mottenden, and the manors of Mottenden, Plushenden, Plomford, and Delmynden in Kent; the rectory of Lancing, Sussex, and all tithes thereto belonging; the advowson of the parish church of Lancing and the vicarage of the same church; a saltmarsh in Canwynden alias Derwishop, Essex; and all lands, &c.;, in the counties of Kent, Sussex, and Essex, late of John Gregory alias John Harietsham, late minister of the Trinitarian priory of Mottenden.

Seiter and starring Joan Fontaine, Walter Abel, George Brent, Dennis O'Keefe and Don DeFore. It is also known as Chameleon. Plot Susan Darell, a successful dramatic actress, returns to New York City from a tour entertaining the troops overseas. She is about to marry Richard Aiken, even though they have only known each other for a few weeks. Then Richard discovers that Susan has an ex-husband (and her current Broadway producer) named Roger Berton and two other former boyfriends when he sees their pictures in her living room. At a cocktail party, he meets all three, each of whom describes her as an entirely different person. Worried, he invites them all to dinner, where he asks them to tell him all they know about her. Roger is willing, but the other two start to walk out. However, when Roger starts reminiscing about Susan, they sit back down. Roger meets Susan while on vacation in Rhode Island. When actress Mona Kent shows up, hoping to be cast as Joan of Arc in his next production, he flees by rowboat to an island. He talks a man into letting him board at his house for a while. He meets Susan, the man's niece, who lives there. Initially suspicious of her, he discovers that she is straightforward and honest and completely uninterested in acting. However, he thinks she is perfect to play Joan and makes her an actress, against her strong resistance. Then they fall in love and get married. Just before the premiere of Joan of Arc, Mona shows up and tries to sabotage it by getting a naive Susan drunk. Roger finds out in time and sobers her up. Susan draws rave reviews, but hardly anyone comes to see the play. Roger becomes repeatedly annoyed when Susan's complete honesty and forthrightness cause trouble for him. They divorce as a result. Next up is Mike Ward, a wealthy lumberman from Montana. He meets Roger in a bar. When Roger sees how rich he is, he invites Mike to his office to discuss Mike investing in Roger's next show. A more sophisticated and less honest Susan barges in during the meeting, and taking a lesson from Mona, flatters Mike and takes him to lunch. Mike falls in love and begins proposing to her in a nightclub. Susan starts to let him down gently when Roger barges in and, assuming the worst (and wanting to reconcile with her), infuriates Susan into accepting Mike. However, Mike finds out about Susan's (fairly innocent) lying and breaks up with her. Then novelist named Bill Anthony meets Susan in a park. Under Bill's influence, Susan turns into an intellectual. When Roger tells her that Bill does not believe in marriage, she does not trust him. She gets Bill drunk, knowing that when he is intoxicated he will agree to anything, and sets out to find a justice of the peace to marry them, but at the last moment, changes her mind. Back in the present, Bill regrets that she did not go through with it. Reassured, Richard decides to go ahead with the marriage. However, Mike and Bill both propose to Susan again. She gently turns them down. Roger tells her that when they were first married, she was too young. Now she has grown up. She ultimately chooses him over Richard. Cast Reception The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Story in the 18th Academy Awards, but lost to The House on 92nd Street. Critic Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, \\"Producer Hal Wallis should have condensed the whole romp into an hour or so and not the two hours which the picture takes to run its course.\\" He thought all four male leads gave capable performances, but found Fontaine's to be \\"very uneven\\".

It was approximately long and weighed around . It probably fed on insects. Brasilitherium was found in the Candelária Formation of the Paraná Basin in southeastern Brazil. Brasilitherium represents a transition between advanced cynodonts and mammals, having features of both and having early evolution of certain mammalian features, such as hearing and a nasal cavity.  Paleoenvironment  The discovery was part of the Caturrita Formation, where the rock was made up of two different layers, the lower layers being sandstone and upper layers being mudstone. This specific taxon was found in the fine sandstone layer in the middle. The fossils were found in outcrops, and due to the different layers, it is suggested that there was a river, and this area experienced both gravitational flows as well as peak flows. Gravitational flow would be a type of flow due to gravity, where as peak flows would be due to specific events that experienced a high amount of flow causing an event.  Discovery  Brasilitherium was discovered in Rio Grande do Sul in Southern Brazil, work initiated by the Museu de Ciencias Naturals of the Fundacao Zoobotanica of Porto Alegre. Brasilitherium is part of the family Brasilodontidae, and was found in the middle to late triassic.Bonaparte2013 The family of Brasilodontidae was found in Argentina, India, and Brazil, where Brasilitherium was found. Brasilitherium is thought to be a transitional species between cynodonts and the earliest mammals.  Description and paleobiology  = Skull = The skull of the Brasilitherium is about in length. The dentary bone in the skull is more slender than in previous ancestors, as well as a slightly smaller skull in general. The genus Brasilodon is different from Brasilitherium due to the lower post canines as well as the pre orbital. Although more studies and more fossils are needed to truly confirm, paleontologists seem to believe that Brasilodon and Brasilitherium are not sister groups and that Brasilitherium is more closely related to mammaliaformes. The lower jaw is articulated to the skull, which is between the squamosal and the dentary which isn't seen in other cyandonts. When looking the jaw of Brasilitherium, one could say that it is closely related to Thrinaxodon, but paleontologists have concluded that they are not closely related, but simply have convergent evolution. The skull shows quadrangular upper post canines and asymmetrical lower post canines. Post- canines are constantly getting replaced in this taxon and they are replaced in an alternate sequence, meaning they are not getting replaced next to each other at the same time. Brasilitherium's post canine teeth also have more that one replacement which is something they keep from their cynodont ancestors. The upper incisors are also ventrally directed. In terms of comparing Brasilitherium to Brasilodon, the interpterygoid vacuity is 1/6 the skull length in Brasilodon and 1/8 the skull length in Brasilitherium. From the skull paleontologists found that the wings of the vomer and posterior part of the nasal cavity forms the primary mouth roof, and an elongated secondary palate also forms.Ruf2014 Origin of the nasal capsule is hard to place on a phylogony due to late ossification, therefore it was most likely cartilagenous in this taxon. = Other features = Limb bone osteohistology of Brasilitherium riograndensis Brasilitherium is a transitional taxon that sets the stage for development of different critical features. Brasilitherium has specialized their basicranium which allows them to start specializing in the middle ear and hearing. Brasilitherium has a stapedial process of the quadrate which is a derivation of the middle ear. Paleontologists looked at endocasts in order to study the increase in size of olfactory bulbs. Preservation of soft tissue is virtually impossible in fossils, therefore paleontologists rely on endocasts to study the brain. Some skulls have the brain pressed up against them, leaving impressions that allow the paleontologists to see possible structures that are soft tissue that are harder to see such as blood vessels. They found that the casts in Brasilitherium was larger than non mammaliaform cynodonts. This led to the suggestion that Brasilitherium had early evolution of the mammalian brain. Similar to mammaliaforms and not cynodonts, Brasilitherium is found to have grooves in their post canine teeth as well as a formation of a tongue. Another similarity to mammalian taxon is that the intraorbital fenstra evolves under the orbit.  See also  * Trithelodontidae  References   Further reading  *Bonaparte et al.

Depending on the ratio of the high- field and low-field mobility of the ion, it will migrate toward one or the other electrode. Only ions with specific mobility will pass through the device.  Application  One application of FAIMS is as an additional separation step between the liquid chromatography separation and mass spectrometric analysis in Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as used in proteomic studies. It allows for online fractionation of the analyte components to improve detection of peptides in complex samples. LC-MS uses the mass to charge ratio of peptide ions to analyse samples and the resulting spectra are compared to spectral reference libraries. FAIMS can be used to filter out \\"chemical noise\\", i.e. compounds whose spectra would interfere with the spectra of the desired compound, either by overlapping with the desired compound's spectra or adding additional peaks to the spectra. It can be used to filter out interfering ions and simultaneously select peptides with charge states that are optimal for analysis. A further advantage of this technique is that it can be used to select for peptide ions that are of low abundance in the sample. Such low abundance ions are often not analysed because of the limitations of the duty cycles of the mass spectrometers. By selectively removing the more abundant ions FAIMS can assist in distinguishing between ions with similar mass to charge ratios and can prevent a more abundant ion from masking the presence of a less abundant ion.

Sohaemus was a member of the Royal family of Emesa. He was the second born son and a child to Priest King Sampsiceramus II who ruled the Emesene Kingdom from 14 until 42 and Queen Iotapa. He had an elder brother called Gaius Julius Azizus, who was the first husband of the Herodian Princess Drusilla and had two sisters: Iotapa who married the Herodian Prince Aristobulus Minor and Mamaea. Sohaemus was born and raised in Emesa. His paternal grandfather was the former Emesene Priest King Iamblichus II, while his maternal grandparents were the former Commagenean Monarchs Mithridates III of Commagene and his cousin-wife Iotapa. Azizus had died in 54 and Sohaemus succeeded his brother as Priest King. He ruled from 54 until his death in 73 and was the priest of the Syrian Sun God, known in Aramaic as El-Gebal. At an unknown date in his reign, Sohaemus became the patron of the Roman colony of Heliopolis (modern Baalbek, Lebanon). In honor of his patronage to Heliopolis, a statue of him with an accompanied honorific inscription was dedicated to him in the city. The honorary Latin inscription reads: : The inscription dedicates and honors, Sampsiceramus II with his son Sohaemus each as a Great King [Regis Magni]. In the inscription, Sohaemus is honored as a duumveir quinquennalis; a Patron of the colony at Heliopolis and has been granted the ornamenta consularia [honorary consular status]. In the first year of his reign, under either Roman emperor Claudius or Nero, Sohaemus received the Roman province of Sophene to rule. As Sophene was near the source of the Tigris river, he would have been able to mount his archers to ward off the Parthians. In 56, Sohaemus married his relative who was the Princess Drusilla of Mauretania. She was the child of the late Roman Client Monarchs Ptolemy of Mauretania and Julia Urania. Drusilla was the great grandchild of Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. In Sohaemus’ reign, Emesene's relations with the Roman government grew closer. When Vespasian in 69 became Roman emperor, Sohaemus was among the first to swear allegiance to him. Under him, Emesa sent the Roman military a regular levy of archers and assisted them in their siege of Jerusalem in 70. In 72, Sohaemus supplied troops to the Roman General Lucius Caesennius Paetus who was the head of the Legio VI Ferrata, in the annexation of the Kingdom of Commagene. Drusilla was a Queen consort to Sohaemus. Drusilla bore him a son called Gaius Julius Alexio, who is also known as Alexio II. When Sohaemus died, he was buried in the tomb of his ancestors at Emesa and was succeeded by his son. Through his son, Sohaemus would have various descendants ruling on the Emesene throne and among those who claimed from his family's ancestry was Queen of Palmyra, Zenobia. References Sources * H.

This department existed in three different forms during the war. 1861 The first \\"Department of Kansas\\" was created on November 9, 1861 from the Western Department. It included Kansas, Nebraska Territory, Colorado Territory, Dakota Territory and the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). On March 11, 1862 the department was absorbed into the Department of the Mississippi. Brigadier General David Hunter was the sole commander during this period. During this interlude a District of Kansas existed under the command of Brigadier General James W. Denver from March 19-April 10, 1862.Eicher p.830 1862 Two months later the Department of Kansas was reformed out of the Dept. of Mississippi on May 2, 1862. This form of the department included all previous territories except Fort Garland, Colorado. Brigadier General James G. Blunt was appointed commander. On August 16, Blunt created the Army of Kansas which was virtually synonymous with the department. Nebraska and Dakota Territories were detached and transferred to the Department of the Northwest and shortly after on October 11 the Department of Kansas was absorbed into the Department of the Missouri.

It included Kansas, Nebraska Territory, Colorado Territory (except Fort Garland), Indian Territory, and Fort Smith, Arkansas. Major General Samuel R. Curtis was appointed command. Fort Smith and the Indian Territory were transferred to the Department of Arkansas in April. On October 13 Curtis organized the Army of the Border, composed of troops from his department to confront Price's Missouri Raid. For the first time of the war troops from the Department of Kansas were involved in a major campaign, turning back Price's Confederates at the Battle of Westport. The Army of the Border was disbanded on November 9. It was also during this time that Colonel John M. Chivington, commander of the District of Colorado Territory, engaged the Native Americans at the battle of Sand Creek.

Credited to \\"TonyAll\\", it consists of twelve songs written by Lombardo between 1979 and 1989. Lombardo played bass guitar on the entire album, with the members of All playing the rest of the instrumentation. Vocals were split between Lombardo and All singer Scott Reynolds, with All bassist Karl Alvarez also singing one song. Along with their 1990 album Allroy Saves, recorded at the same time, New Girl, Old Story was the last album recorded by All before their relocation from Los Angeles to Brookfield, Missouri.  Background  Lombardo was the original bassist in the Descendents, joining founding members Frank Navetta and Bill Stevenson in 1979 while the group was still in its formative stages. He played on the band's debut single \\"Ride the Wild\\" / \\"It's a Hectic World\\" (1979), the Fat EP (1981), and the albums Milo Goes to College (1982) and I Don't Want to Grow Up (1985), but left the group in 1985 because he did not want to go on tour.\\"The Lombardo Short\\".

The Descendents experienced several lineup changes and in 1987, when singer Milo Aukerman left the band to attend graduate school, the remaining members—Stevenson, bassist Karl Alvarez, and guitarist Stephen Egerton—relaunched the band as All with singer Dave Smalley. Lombardo, meanwhile, performed with singer Scott Reynolds in the bands Boxer Rebellion, Nuclear Bob, and Three Care Pileup. Reynolds replaced Smalley as All's singer in 1988, and Lombardo contributed two songs to Reynolds' first album with the band, Allroy's Revenge (1989), \\"Man-O-Steel\\" and the instrumental \\"Gnutheme\\".Filmage: The Story of Descendents/All\\".

Recording  According to Lombardo, the idea to record an album with All was Stevenson's: \\"Bill owed me some money, and I think he suggested that he would record an album for me in lieu of paying me some money at that particular point in time. I thought it was a great idea.\\" The songs were ones Lombardo had written and arranged between 1979 and 1989. \\"They were songs of a different nature\\", he later recalled. According to Stevenson, some of the songs dealt with a relationship Lombardo had been in with a younger woman: > \\"Special to Me\\" is one of my all time favorite songs of Tony's. He was so > sad about all that with his younger girlfriend, and I swear nothing has ever > been more heartfelt. I get teary just thinking about it. It's so positive > and so negative. When it goes into \\"I love you, even though I know, too > [that our love is taboo]\\", it's like the saddest thing I've ever heard. But > there really was a tremendous age difference. The album was recorded in March 1990 at Third Wave Recording in Torrance, California and Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood. Stevenson and Egerton produced and engineered the recording, with additional engineering at Westbeach done by Donnell Cameron. Lombardo played bass guitar on the entire record and sang on five of its twelve tracks. Reynolds sang on five tracks, while Alvarez sang \\"Guitar Case\\" (the remaining track, \\"Son-O-Theme\\", is an instrumental). \\"We got Karl to sing, Scott sang\\", Lombardo later remembered. \\"I sang, if you want to call it singing.

Written by Jay Moriarty & Mike Milligan and directed by Bob Lally, it is the penultimate episode of the sixth season, and the 134th episode of the series. The episode was produced in remembrance of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which occurred 12 years earlier on April 4, 1968. Plot summary While looking through a series of old photographs, Louise (Isabel Sanford) and George (Sherman Hemsley) recall the opening of the first Jefferson Cleaners store in Harlem. On April 4, 1968, George prepares to sign the final papers to obtain a loan allowing him to open the store, which he plans to call \\"Handy Dandy Cleaners\\" (rejecting Louise's suggestion to use the name \\"Jefferson Cleaners\\" instead). Meanwhile, Lionel (who is approximately eighteen years old) is becoming increasingly militant, and Louise and George worry that his future is headed in the wrong direction. While inspecting the space that George has rented for the store, the three of them notice that civil unrest has broken out in the streets. One of the rioters informs them that Martin Luther King Jr. has just been assassinated. The family is stunned, and an infuriated George hurls a chair through his own storefront window, screaming \\"You bastards!!\\" The next day, the loan officer from the bank (Roger Bowen) arrives at the Jeffersons' apartment with the final paperwork for the loan. However, the man shows little empathy for the grief accompanying Dr. King's death, and George throws him out after he refers to the people in the neighborhood as \\"animals\\". A frustrated Lionel (Mike Evans) starts to head outside to join the rioters, but George and Louise convince him to stay, reminding him that Dr. King would not approve. The episode ends with Louise, George and Lionel listening to a news report on the radio. An excerpt from Dr. King's last speech, \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\", is being played, as the three family members struggle to hold back their tears. Continuity error The events portrayed in this episode contradict the already-established history of the characters, who were originally described as having just opened their first cleaning store in the All in the Family episode \\"My Aching Back\\" (first airing in 1971, three years after King's assassination). The first store was said to have been funded with money George had been awarded in a settlement, following a motor vehicle accident.

Prior to joining the BYU staff in 2017, he served at Louisiana State University (LSU) from 2014 to 2017 as offensive line coach and run game coordinator, offensive line coach at Virginia Tech in 2013, and a similar position at Auburn University from 2009 through the 2012 season. Before coaching at Auburn, he was the assistant head coach, running game coordinator and offensive line coach at the University of Colorado. Grimes also coached the offensive line at BYU, Arizona State University (ASU) and Boise State University (BSU). Personal life Grimes graduated from the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP) in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in education, and earned a master's degree in education administration from Texas A&M; in 1997, while serving as a graduate assistant. He is married to former Aggies volleyball player Sheri Hermesmeyer-Grimes and they are the parents of four children. Playing career Grimes earned four letters as an offensive tackle for the UTEP Miners between 1987 and 1990. He was coached by Marty Mornhinweg {QB coach), Dave Toub (strength coach), Andy Reid offensive line coach) and Dirk Koetter (offensive coordinator). Grimes was not drafted into the National Football League (NFL), but had a brief professional career, participating in training camp with both the Los Angeles Raiders and the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football. Coaching career Grimes entered into coaching in 1993 as a high school coach at Riverside High School in El Paso. After two years as the offensive coordinator and line coach there, he decided to make the move to the college ranks and started working as a graduate assistant under Ken Hatfield at Rice in 1995. He spent the next two seasons in the same position under R. C. Slocum at Texas A&M;, while serving under line coach Mike Sherman, before receiving his first full-time college position in 1998, serving as offensive line coach at Hardin–Simmons, under Jimmie Keeling. The Cowboys were 21-2 during his tenure, averaged 39.4 points per game and reached the national semifinals in 1999. Grimes was hired to join his college coach, Koetter, at BSU for the 2000 season, working alongside Dan Hawkins. In his one season at BSU, Grimes’ offensive line helped the Broncos lead the nation in scoring offense and accumulate 175 rushing yards per game. When Koetter was hired as the new head coach at ASU after the season, Grimes also left the Broncos to join the Sun Devils, serving as offensive line coach and running game coordinator. Grimes had great success at ASU, with four of the 2001 seniors drafted into the NFL (just the second time that had been done at any school since the NFL adopted the seven-round draft format in 1993). He helped orchestrate a solid rushing attack, tutoring Loren Wade to break the ASU freshman rushing record while leading the Pac-10 in yards per carry. After spending 3 years with the Sun Devils, Grimes was offered the job coaching the offensive line at BYU by Gary Crowton. After Crowton resigned following the 2004 season, newly promoted head coach Bronco Mendenhall decided to keep Grimes on his staff. His 2006 BYU linemen blocked for the nation's fourth best offense, averaging over 465 yards per game including 141.9 on the ground, and were a large part of the Cougars winning the MWC Championship. BYU finished 11-2 and ranked 15th in the Coaches' Poll. Hawkins lured Grimes away from BYU to Colorado in February 2007. He had previously worked with Hawkins at Boise State and also served with Colorado offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich at ASU. Grimes served as the assistant head coach, running game coordinator and offensive line coach for the Buffaloes. On January 18, 2009, Grimes was hired by new head coach Gene Chizik to fill the vacant position coaching the offensive line at Auburn. After the 2010 season, Grimes was interviewed by Mack Brown to become the new offensive line coach at the University of Texas, where it was reported he would have become the highest paid coach at his position in the country. Ultimately, Grimes decided to stay at Auburn. At the end of the 2012 season, Chizik was fired by Auburn. Former offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn was hired as head coach on December 4, 2012. Shortly after being hired, Malzahn announced that all assistant coaches were being released, thus ending Grimes' career at Auburn. On January 18, 2013, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer announced Grimes' hiring as one of three new Hokies offensive assistants, along with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler (also formerly of Auburn) and wide receivers coach Aaron Moorehead (formerly of Stanford University). Following Virginia Tech's 2013 bowl game, Grimes accepted the offensive line coaching job at LSU under Les Miles replacing Greg Studrawa. The news was unofficially released on January 15, 2014 and later confirmed by Virginia Tech's RB coach, Shane Beamer. In December 2017, he was named the offensive coordinator at BYU, replacing Ty Detmer. Grimes has experience coaching in seven bowl games: the 2000 Aloha Bowl, 2002 Holiday Bowl, 2005 Las Vegas Bowl, 2006 Las Vegas Bowl, 2007 Independence Bowl, 2010 Outback Bowl, 2011 BCS National Championship Game and the 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl.

It was one of the strongest castles, controlling the Elean fields and the mountain passes to Tritaia. It was built in 1311 by the Frankish Nicholas of Saint-Omer, who gave his name to the castle.William Miller The Principality of the Peloponnese, 1927, Greek translation by Spyridon Lambrou, In Venetian records it was listed as Edrolcamo (Εντρόλκαμο). Saint-Omer was lord of Thebes. Around the castle developed a large city, that had 1,500 houses at its peak. The Byzantines had tried many times to besiege the castle without succeeding. According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea, the Byzantines lost 1,500 men and 500 horses in a large battle between the Byzantines and Navarrese, that ruled the castle at the time. It was handed over as dowry to the Despot of the Morea Constantine Palaeologus in 1429 along with Chlemoutsi castle, when he married Theodora Tocco, daughter of Leonardo II Tocco. Theodora died the following year during childbirth and was buried in Santameri. After many years, her remains were transferred to Mystras. The Ottomans captured the castle in 1460, and many of its inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery. Today, the walls of the castle and ruins of many buildings and a Byzantine church remain.

During smelting, impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal. Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are disposed of as waste or utilized as discussed below. Characteristics Slag from ores that are mechanically concentrated before smelting contain mostly iron oxides and silicon oxides. Applications =Grit Blasting= Copper slag is mainly used for surface blast-cleaning. Abrasive blasting is used to clean and shape the surface of metal, stone, concrete and other materials. In this process, a stream of abrasive grains called grit are propelled toward the workpiece. Copper slag is just one of many different materials that may be used as abrasive grit. Rate of grit consumption, amount of dust generated, and surface finish quality are some of the variables affected by the choice of grit material. Internationally the described media is manufactured in compliance with ISO 11126-3ISO 11126-3:1993 Preparation of steel substrates before application of paints and related products  Specifications for non-metallic blast-cleaning abrasives  Part 3: Copper refinery slag: Preparation of Steel Substrates Before Application of Paints and Related Products. The blasting media manufactured from copper slag brings less harm to people and environment than sand. The product meets the most rigid health and ecological standards. =Construction= Copper slag can be used in concrete production as a partial replacement for sand. Copper slag is used as a building material, formed into blocks. Such use was common in areas where smelting was done, including St Helens and Cornwall in England. In Sweden (Skellefteå region) fumed and settled granulated copper slag from the Boliden copper smelter is used as road-construction material. The granulated slag (<3 mm size fraction) has both insulating and drainage properties which are usable to avoid ground frost in winter which in turn prevents pavement cracks. The usage of this slag reduces the usage of primary materials as well as reduces the construction depth which in turn reduces energy demand in building. Due to the same reasons the granulated slag is usable as a filler and insulating material in house foundations in a cold climate. Numerous houses in the same region are built with a slag insulated foundation.http://jarnsand.boliden.com/  See also  * Pressure washer * Dross * Water jet cutter  References  Industrial processes Metalworking ","title":"Copper slag"},{"id":"21156217","text":"Central Bank of Syria on the Sabaa Bahrat Square Sabaa Bahrat Square ( / ALA- LC: sāḥat as-Saba‘a Baḥrāt; which means \\"square of the Seven Fountains\\") is a large and important square in Damascus, Syria.

The Sunseeker Solar Car Project, Sunseeker for short, is Western Michigan University's solar car team. Each vehicle is designed, built, maintained, and raced by students. Sunseeker has competed in all of the American Solar Challenge events, going back to 1990.https://www.wmich.edu/sunseeker/about/ The mission of the Sunseeker Solar Car Project is to design, build, and race solar powered vehicles to advance and demonstrate the abilities of the renewable energy technologies. When not racing, the team participates in numerous events, where they show their cars to the public.  History  = 1990 = In 1990, WMU's Sunseeker competed in the General Motors sponsored Sunrayce USA that ran from Orlando, Florida to Warren, Michigan. With over 1600 miles and 38 competitors, Sunseeker 77 finished in 8th place. = 1991 = In 1991, Sunseeker competed in two Arizona solar challenges. One of them was the Solar and Electric 500 at Phoenix International Speedway where Sunseeker received the honor of 5th place. Sunseeker placed an impressive 2nd place in the Arizona Governor's Cup Solar Challenge, a 2.5 mile Grand Prix course through the streets of Phoenix, Arizona. = 1993 = In 1993, GM was joined by the DOE, National Renewable Energy Laboratories and EDS to sponsor the solar challenge. The Sunrayce ran from Dallas, Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Rain and clouds contributed to a disappointing 18th place for Sunseeker 93. = 1995 = The NREL, EDS, and GM together sponsored the 1995 Sunrayce. The route ran from the Indianapolis Speedway to Denver, Colorado. Sunseeker 95 took advantage of the excellent chassis from the previous race and built a new array, installed a new power train, refined the aerodynamics, and formed a new strategy. These changes allowed Sunseeker to place 8th in a competitive field of 36 cars. = 1997 = The 1997 Sunrayce ran from Indianapolis to Colorado Springs, Colorado with the DOE, EDS and General Motors as its sponsors. The team built an entirely new vehicle for 1997. Sunseeker 97 finished in 16th-place. = 1999 = 1999 brought about a whole new aerodynamic body design that was different from all previous Sunseeker designs. There was only one problem: rain. Nine of the ten race days from Washington, D.C. to Orlando, Florida were plagued with overcast and rain. The rain damaged one of Sunseeker's two motors, which had to be taken apart and dried. On the last and only sunny day of the race, Sunseeker 454 passed more than 20 competitors and finished 3rd for the day, but still finished in 26th position overall. = 2001 = Sunseeker 295 at the Air Zoo The first American Solar Challenge race in 2001 was sponsored by EDS, the DOE, and NREL. WMU hosted scrutineering where the solar cars are inspected for mechanical, electrical and safety requirements. Sunseeker 95 was modified with a new array panel and more efficient solar cells. The wheels were replaced with the carbon fiber wheels used on the 1999 car. A number of other modifications were made and the car was renamed Sunseeker 295. After a 2400-mile race from Chicago to Los Angeles down Route 66, it finished 5th in Stock Class and 23rd overall. = 2003 = For WMU's Centennial in 2003, the team reduced the 1999 car's length and width and constructed an all composite body and chassis of carbon fiber and honeycomb, designed a new rear suspension, built a high efficiency solar array, and installed the hub motors from the '99 car. Entered in the Open Class, again following Route 66, Sunseeker 03 captured 5th place in the race, sporting car number 786. It also won the Inspector's Award for best mechanical and electrical design, the Sportsmanship Award, the Most Improved Award, and EDS's Gold Award for Best Solar Car Design. = 2005 = For 2005, the race became the North American Solar Challenge as the route started in Austin, Texas and ran north to Winnipeg, Manitoba then west to Calgary, Alberta. It was the longest solar car race ever at 2500 miles (4000 km). Sunseeker 03 was given a new canopy, stronger rear suspension, improved aerodynamics and renamed Sunseeker 05. With no mechanical or electrical breakdowns, car number 786 crossed the finish line in 6th place and took home the Aesthetics Award for the prettiest car. Sunseeker 05 can still be seen in public events, such as the Kalamazoo Holiday Parade, along with other past Sunseeker solar cars.250x250px = 2008 = A radical change in driver seating for the 2008 solar challenge caused all teams to build totally new cars. Sunseeker 08 used the very efficient array from the previous car and was changed to a front wheel drive quasi three wheel vehicle since the two rear wheels were about a foot apart behind the cockpit bulge. However, the array blew off the car during qualifying and the car could not participate in the event. WMU team members joined other teams to assist during the race. At the award ceremony after the race, they received the Sportsmanship Award to a long round of applause. The 2010 car racing towards the top of the hill at turn one at 250x250px = 2010 - 2014 = For 2010, the team introduced a new solar car to compete in the American Solar Challenge. The vehicle was the first, and remains as the only three-wheeled design produced by the team. It has two powered wheels in the front, and a single unpowered wheel in the back. It is considered an experimental motorcycle by the Michigan Secretary of State. Each of the two CISIRO motors produce 6 horsepower, and enable the 600 pound (without a driver) car to travel at most 80 miles per hour. During races, however, the car's top speed was limited to 45 miles per hour in order to keep it running efficiently. The 2010 car raced in three American Solar Challenge road races, and five Formula Sun Grand Prix races. = 2015 - Present = During the Fall 2014 semester, the team began working on the next generation Sunseeker solar car.(Code named Farasi) The car incorporates four wheels, with the two rear wheels being powered. The aeroshell is made of light-weight carbon fiber, while the chassis is made of carbon fiber and chromoly steel. This car was meant to be raced in the 2016 American Solar Challenge but didn't get to compete until the 2017 Formula Sun Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, TX. In 2018 Farasi completed 163 laps at Motorsports Park Hastings for the Formula Sun Grand Prix and ran 52 miles of the American Solar Challenge under a conditional qualification.

History The shows were about an hour in length but could be as short as 25 minutes, either way being well suited for traveling or road shows. They had lower costs and fewer logistical complications than major productions. To achieve this, producers typically eliminated much of the dialogue, plot and chorus of the parent, often Broadway production, reduced the scenery to a few flats and platforms that could be easily transported by rail or roadway, and retained only the hit numbers and the principal characters including the love interests and the chief comic. With this shortened format, tab shows did not usually serve as an entertainment form in themselves but were adjuncts for at least three other forms of major entertainment. First, they could be the featured act of the second half of a vaudeville bill. The substitution of these shows for a portion of vaudeville acts in the early 1900s was described as \\"far- reaching in its scope\\" in a Billboard article of 23 December 1911. Second, they were often performed in conjunction with silent films for a half hour performance either before the film came on, or as a vaudeville act between films. Show Boat was one Broadway hit that was reduced to a truncated tab show running in movie theaters in the early 1930s. Third, tab shows were closely related to the early, non-stripper versions of burlesque. The girls were 'clean' and did not have bare legs. By the 1920s, \\"tab show\\" was sometimes used to avoid the negative, low-brow connotations of \\"burlesque\\". There are two suggestions for the origin of the word \\"tab\\". It is often said to be derived from \\"tabloid\\", as in the short form of a newspaper. Alternatively, it could refer to \\"tableau\\" as in the tab style of curtain across the front of a stage, since the curtain and a few pieces of furniture might be the only scenery used by a tab show. As variations on these themes, tab shows occasionally were up to two hours in length and with their lower costs and fewer logistic demands, were a popular alternative to vaudeville acts in the 1910s. Also, while the term \\"tab show\\" may have been restricted to the United States, the theme of the vicissitudes of traveling third-rate vaudevillians was presented in 1950 in Federico Fellini's Italian film Variety Lights. It has been described as \\"wholesome corn\\".

It is preceded by Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians. Plot summary Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones is the second novel in the Alcatraz series. Sanderson continues the series as Alcatraz goes to the Library of Alexandria and tries to rescue his Dad and Grandpa from the soul stealing library curators. Once he arrives he is immediately separated from the rest of the group consisting of Bastille and her mother Draulin, Alcatraz's uncle Kazan, and Alcatraz's cousin Australia. Alcatraz is travelling through the library alone and he is often pestered by the curators who ask him to take a book at the cost of his soul. The curators speak long forgotten languages which he can understand because of his Translator's Lenses. At one point Alcatraz finds Bastille caught in a net, and he breaks the ropes that bind her. After Bastille and Alcatraz continue to venture Kazan finds them by utilizing his talent of getting lost. He finds them because they are both abstractly lost. Soon after the three travel the library with Kazan's talent they activate another trip wire which encloses them in a hardened goo. Alcatraz escapes by biting through it, and his friends follow suit. Along the way he finds the tomb of Alcatraz the first, who was the first wielder of the breaking talent. His tomb does not age because he broke time. At the tomb he also finds a note which informs him that his talent is more of a curse than a blessing. After activating yet a third trip wire Bastille and Alcatraz fall into a pit. After a lengthy (and awkward) discussion about responsibility, they escape using Windstormer's Lenses and proceed to fight the Scrivener's Bones—a sect of Dark Oculators. They defeat him by tricking him into checking out a book, then the curators take his soul. Later, they find Grandpa Smedry crying over a note. It is revealed that indeed, Attica Smedry (Alcatraz's father) has sold his soul for all the knowledge in the world. But, in claiming a note written before he was turned into a curator, Alcatraz learns of a way to turn him back. Characters Australia (Alcatraz's cousin), ever present Bastille, Draulin (Bastille's mother and knight of Crystallia), and Kazan, or Kaz as he is often called (Alcatraz's uncle), join in the fight against the Librarians. Kilimanjaro, a Scrivener's Bone (a sect of cyborg-like Librarians who replace parts of their bodies with Alivened technology), attempts to capture Alcatraz and his clan throughout the book. Floating around the Library are the always-present Curators of Alexandria, who will let you pick up any book in the Library - at the cost of your soul. Smedry Talents The new Talents are Australia's: waking up and looking incredibly ugly (useful as she wakes up looking like whoever, or whatever, she thought of last before she fell asleep) and Kazan, whose talent is getting lost (also very helpful, as he can 'get lost' whenever he is in a dangerous situation, and he 'finds his way back' when he deems it necessary). Each one helps Alcatraz as he wanders the rows of book shelves in the Library of Alexandria. Also revealed is Alcatraz's father and mother's Talent of Losing Things. Sequels A third Alcatraz book was released October 1, 2009, titled Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia. A fourth book, Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens, was published in 2010.

The term is used to describe economists in the 1820s and 1830s who developed a theory of capitalist exploitation from the theory developed by Ricardo that stated that labor is the source of all wealth and exchange value. This principle extends back to the principles of English philosopher John Locke. The Ricardian socialists reasoned that labor is entitled to all it produces, and that rent, profit and interest were not natural outgrowths of the free market process but were instead distortions. They argued that private ownership of the means of production should be supplanted by cooperatives owned by associations of workers. This designation is used in reference to economists in the early 19th century that elaborated a theory of capitalist exploitation from the classical economic proposition derived from Adam Smith and David Ricardo stating that labor is the source of wealth. Although Ricardian socialist thought had some influence on Karl Marx's theories, Marx rejected many of the fundamental assumptions of the Ricardian socialists, including the view that labor was the source of all wealth. Economics Ricardian socialism is considered to be a form of socialism based on the arguments made by Ricardo that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor and that profit, interest and rent were deductions from this exchange- value. This is deduced from the axiom of Ricardo and Adam Smith that labor is the source of all value. The first imputation that early British and Irish socialists were influenced by Ricardo is made by Karl Marx in his 1846 Poverty of Philosophy: > Anyone who is in any way familiar with the trend of political economy in > England cannot fail to know that almost all the Socialists in that country > have, at different periods, proposed the equalitarian application of the > Ricardian theory. We quote for M. Proudhon: Hodgskin, Political Economy, > 1827; William Thompson, An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution > of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness, 1824; T. R. Edmonds, Practical > Moral and Political Economy, 1828 [18], etc., etc., and four pages more of > etc. We shall content ourselves with listening to an English Communist, Mr. > Bray. We shall give the decisive passages in his remarkable work, Labor's > Wrongs and Labor's Remedy, Leeds, 1839... The link is later re-asserted by Herbert Foxwell in his introduction to the English translation of Anton Menger's \\"The Right to the Whole Produce of Labor\\" (1899). Consequently, the category of Ricardian socialist came to be accepted by supporters and opponents both of Marxism by the early 20th century. However, in recent years a number of scholars have challenged the validity of the category based on the lack of evidence that its proposed members had either read Ricardo's \\"Principles of Political Economy\\" or the contradictory internal evidence of their own value theory which appears to owe more to Adam Smith than Ricardo. So much so that several scholars prefer the term \\"Smithian Socialism\\".Noel Thompson discusses several scholars in his 1977 article Ricardian socialists/Smithian socialists: what's in a name?, made available as a Research Paper of Cambridge University doi:10.1017/CBO9780511522840.006, and reprinted as Chapter 4 of Thompson (1984).

It was formed by coastal erosion of the scarp in the Pleistocene, when the sea level was higher, and the scarp located further west than at present. The action of coastal forces produced sand dunes that subsequently lithified into eolianite, and eroded the ironstone of the scarp, resulting in an iron-rich sandstone with a laterite cap. The iron gives the sandstone a dull purple-brown colour; depending on the extent of iron- enrichment, the sandstone may appear predominantly yellow, predominantly purple-brown, or a mottled combination of the two. The shelf is about high on average, and is therefore well-drained. It is largely vegetated by a forest of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) and Corymbia calophylla (Marri), with an understorey of Banksia, Casuarina fraseriana and Xylomelum occidentale (Woody Pear). Some publications identify the Ridge Hill Shelf with the foothills of the scarp, but this is incorrect.

His research field was the visualization of dynamic processes within living cells using light microscopy. Research Inoué can be considered the father of the field of cytoskeleton dynamics. In the 1940s and 50s he built the first microscope capable of imaging dynamic processes in live cells, using polarized light, and proved for the first time that the mitotic spindle is composed of aligned protein fibers. We now know these fibers are microtubules. By perturbing cells with agents that cause microtubules to depolymerize (e.g. colchicine or high pressure) or polymerize excessively (e.g. D2O), Inoué demonstrated that spindle fibers are in a state of rapid dynamic equilibrium with a pool of soluble subunits in the cytoplasm. He went on to show that artificial polymerization and depolymerization of spindle fibers can generate forces within the cell, and proposed that chromosomes are normally moved by such forces during mitosis. These ideas were summarized in a seminal review in 1967. He also was the first to develop video microscopy, and wrote a major textbook on the subject. Consistent with Inoué's pioneering ideas, it is now widely believed that chromosome movement during mitosis is powered by microtubule depolymerization. We also know that force generation by polymerization and depolymerization of cytoskeletal protein fibers is perhaps the most ancient of motile mechanisms within cells, whose use extends back to bacteria. Personal life Inoué was born in London, England, the son of a diplomat. He built his first polarized light microscope from a discarded machine gun base and a tin tea can. He attended Tokyo Metropolitan University, and went to Princeton University for his graduate studies. He was a member of the faculty at Dartmouth College (1959–1966) and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania (1966-1982), before joining the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in 1982. Inoué died in East Falmouth, Massachusetts on September 30, 2019.

Vision The College's stated vision is to provide a caring and supportive environment, where students are encouraged to grow in faith within a Catholic community and to develop their potential.http://www.staloysius.tas.edu.au/vision-mission/ History St Aloysius Catholic College, founded in 1960 by the Sisters of Charity as St Aloysius Primary School, catered for Kindergarten to Grade 6 until 2009, when the educational capacity began expanding to cater for Grades 7 -10. The Sisters conducted the school until 2001. In 2007, the Archbishop of Hobart, Adrian Doyle, gave approval for the primary school to extend its educational program to include Grades 7 -10 and for St Aloysius School to become St Aloysius Catholic College. The introduction of the Grades 5 -10 facilities at the Huntingfield Campus began in 2009. The Kindergarten to Grade 4 Kingston Campus had its educational provision enhanced with the construction of the Sisters of Charity Centre, a large ominous multi-purpose facility, and an extension to provide extra learning areas for Kindergarten staff and students. Further developments took place in early 2015.http://www.staloysius.tas.edu.au/about-us/history-of-the-college/ After the Sisters of Charity handed leadership over of the school, Janine O’Hea was the first lay Principal.

The wetlands are preserved within the Boondall Wetlands Reserve which was preserved in 1990 and covers more than 1100 hectares of internationally significant wetlands. Description The Boondall Wetlands are Brisbane's largest wetlands. They became protected under the Ramsar Convention on 22 October 1993. The northern boundary is marked by Cabbage Tree Creek and the Kedron Brook floodway marks the southern limits of the wetlands. Nudgee Creek and the Gateway Motorway both pass through the wetlands, with the later providing road access to the Boondall Wetlands Environment Centre. Facilities in the park includes elevated walkways, bikeways and bird watching platforms. Flora and fauna The reserve supports various vegetation communities including tidal flats, mangroves, freshwater lakes, salt marshes, casuarina forests, melaleuca swamplands, grasslands, open forests, woodlands and remnant rainforest. The wetlands support a diversity of wildlife, including invertebrates, fish, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and more than 190 species of birds. Many of the birds are international migratory shorebirds which breed during the northern summer months in Arctic regions, making Boondall Wetlands globally important for these long-distance visitors. The wetlands form part of the Moreton Bay and Pumicestone Passage Important Bird Area. Some of the migratory species include the Mongolian plover, eastern curlew, grey-tailed tattler and bar- tailed godwit.

The 317-bed hospital is part of the Allegheny Health Network. It serves as a Clinical Campus of Temple University School of Medicine, offering medical education, including a large number of residency and fellowship programs, as well as its own nursing program on campus. Founded on March 18, 1848, as Pittsburgh's first chartered public hospital, West Penn was built Pittsburgh's 12th ward, on a hillside overlooking the city's Strip District and adjacent to what is now Polish Hill (today, that plot is home to a ballfield and West Penn Park, after having been sold to the City of Pittsburgh). The four-story, 120-patient hospital finally opened in spring 1853, after five years of design, construction and funding setbacks. During its early years, many of the patients were those injured by industrial accidents in Pittsburgh's mills and rail yards. Others had mental illness, and in 1862, West Penn opened the Dixmont Hospital (known officially as the \\"Department of the Insane in the Western Pennsylvania Hospital of Pittsburgh”) on a steep bluff overlooking the Ohio River, about eight miles downriver from West Penn. That hospital, the first specialized mental health facility in Western Pennsylvania, remained under West Penn's ownership until 1907. Eight years after the opening of West Penn Hospital, the American Civil War began, and West Penn became a primary triage center serving Union Forces. Because of its size, and because it was a public hospital not bound by religious affiliations, the United States government commandeered West Penn Hospital in 1862, making alterations to it and turning it into a military hospital for the next three years. (Civilians could still be treated at West Penn in emergency situations). By the end of the Civil War in 1865, some 3,000 soldiers had been treated at West Penn. The West Penn Medical College, founded by West Penn surgeons and doctors, opened in October 1885, with a class of 55 students. It was the region's first medical school. By the turn of the 20th Century, the original hospital was outdated, and the hospital's board agreed to build a new hospital in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield neighborhood, about a mile to the east. The cornerstone was laid in 1909, and on New Year's Day, 1912, the new West Penn Hospital opened, and 219 patients then in the hospital's care were moved to the new hospital. The six-story, X-shaped hospital was able to accommodate up to 500 patients, and featured modern operating rooms, laboratories, and X-ray machines. In 1919, the hospital purchased another property on Friendship Avenue and by 1923 had opened a \\"Residence and Training School\\", now the West Penn School of Nursing. The building currently houses nurse educators and students as well as the Simulation Teaching, Academic Research (STAR) Center. In 1950, West Penn added a new obstetrical wing, an intensive care unit came in 1958, and by the 1960s, another substantial expansion was underway; West Penn launched a capital campaign to build a new entrance to the hospital along Millvale Avenue, and to build a new ambulatory care center along Liberty Avenue (to be named Mellon Pavilion). Both Mellon Pavilion and the hospital's renowned Burn Care Unit opened in 1970, a heliport was added in 1971, and the East Tower, which specialized in diagnostic and critical care, opened in 1981. A nine-story patient care tower was added in 1995, topped by a copper dome visible for miles. The late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in several changes to West Penn's governance structure. Following the fall of AHERF and its historic 1998 bond default, West Penn Hospital agreed to rescue AGH and its affiliates through a merger. As alternative to bankruptcy liquidation, AGH, Forbes, Allegheny Valley and Canonsburg “were transferred to the West Penn system in 1999 in exchange for a $25 million payment to the creditors, who agreed to release [AGH] from liability for all claims.” That new system was known as the West Penn Allegheny Health System. In 2010, as parent company West Penn Allegheny Health System was experiencing severe cash shortages and financial difficulties, WPAHS leadership agreed to close West Penn's emergency room as a cost-saving measure. It closed on Jan. 1, 2011, and remained closed until February 2012, after WPAHS had reached an agreement in principle with Highmark Inc. regarding the acquisition of the hospital system. That agreement was announced in June 2011, and without the affiliation and capital infusion from Highmark, had “another investor not materialized, WPAHS was preparing a budget that would have included the autumn closure of West Penn Hospital,” according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. West Penn became a part of Allegheny Health Network in 2013. Today, West Penn Hospital is a 317-bed academic medical center; its obstetrical program delivers 4,000 babies a year, and the hospital's Level III neonatal intensive care unit, its adult and pediatric certified burn trauma center, its extended-hours oncology clinic and dozens of other services draw patients from across the state. West Penn was the first hospital in southwestern Pennsylvania to receive the prestigious Magnet Recognition Program award for nursing excellence American Nurses Credentialing Center, in 2006, and it is also the first in the region to be re-designated for a third consecutive time.

His series was called \\"The Lost World.\\" Fictional history Hunt Bowman lived on a future Earth that had been conquered by the Voltamen, fierce reptilian creatures that were initially depicted as short and orange, but later became tall with green skin. He is a giant of a man, massively strong, and highly skilled with a bow and arrow. He is discovered living on Earth by Lyssa, the Queen of Mars, when she leads an exploration party onto that planet. She takes him to Mars with her, then they return to Earth, where they gradually develop a resistance movement against the Voltaman. Among the people who join their resistance movement is Bruce, one of a set of triplets found by the Voltamen in suspended animation, who is in possession of the body of Guth, the Prince of the Voltamen. After Bruce was killed, his brother placed Bruce's brain into the Voltaman's body. While they develop their resistance movement, Hunt and Lyssa wander the future earth, defending the remaining people they find against the Voltamen. =The Voltamen= By the beginning of their appearance in the first story in Planet Comics #21, the Voltamen have already conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. Hunt Bowman, one of the few surviving free humans, meets Lyssa, the Queen of Mars, and together they defeat the Voltamen who have captured them, and use their ship to return to Lyssa's homeworld. There, they form an invasion party to take back the Earth from the Voltamen. Originally, the Voltamen were depicted as being short, somewhat hunchbacked, and orange- skinned beings, but eventually they became the tall thin green-skinned lizard men familiar to most of the Fiction House readers. The Voltamen wear grey uniforms with spiked pith helmets similar to those worn in World War I, and they have jet black eyes with red pupils. =Bruce= Bruce was one of a group of three siblings who were found by a party of Voltamen in the ruins of their father's laboratory and revived by the Voltaman commander. Once revived, the Voltamen wanted to kill the three children, but Hunt Bowman and Lyssa intervened and defeated the Voltamen. The Voltaman commander shot Bruce right through the heart and was tackled by Hunt and subdued. Bruce's brother, Thomas, then removed Bruce's brain from his dying body and transplanted it into the body of the Voltaman commander — who turned out to be Prince Guth, the Emperor's son. Because he possessed the Prince's body, Bruce was able to go the Voltaman's home planet, Volta, due to an accident and kill their aging Emperor. This act made him a wanted man.

Chieftain Malla Byre Gowda of Avathi, a Vijayanagara empirevassal, built a mud fort in c. 1501 at Devanadoddi (now called Devanahalli). In the late 18th century, Hyder Ali re- constructed the fort in stone resulting in the current structure. It was originally built in 1501 by Mallabairegowda, which remained in the hands of his descendants until the mid–eighteenth century. In 1749, the then Dalwai of Mysore, Nanjarajaiah, attacked the fort and occupied it. Later, the fort passed into the hands of Hyder Ali and subsequently Tipu Sultan. In 1791, Lord Cornwallis laid siege to the fort and took possession during the Anglo-Mysore War. The birthplace of Tipu Sultan, also known as Tiger of Mysore, is located near to the fort. The fort is situated on the side of National Highway 7, near the Bengaluru International Airport. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) board outside the fort and at Tipu Sultan's birthplace declares them to be protected monuments. History Exterior of the fort The history of Devanahalli dates back to 15th century, when a family of fleeing refugees from Conjeevaram (modern day Kanchi), camped near the foot of Ramaswami betta, east of Nandi Hills. Their leader Rana Baire Gowda was apparently directed in a dream to set up a settlement in this region. He and his Morasu Wokkalu family settled in a small village, Ahuti, which was later known as Avati. His son Malla Baire Gowda founded Devanahalli, Chikka-ballapura and Dodda-ballapura. Kempegowda, the founder of Bangalore city is also from Morasu Wokkalu family. Devanahalli was part of Gangawadi and later came under the rule of Rashatrakutas, Nolamba, Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara rulers. During the time of Vijayanagra rule, Malla Baire constructed the initial mud fort in 1501 AD with the consent of Devaraya at Devanadoddi, the previous name of Devanahalli. In 1747 AD, the fort passed into the hands of the Wodeyars of Mysore under the command of Nanja Raja. It was conquered many times from the Marathas and later came under the control of Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan. Fort entrance Tipu also renamed it as Yousafabad (the abode of Yousuf, the finest man) which never got popular. The fort finally fell into the British, under Lord Cornwallis in 1791, during the Mysore War. Architecture Fort is spread over an area of 20 acres (8 ha). The roughly oval east oriented fortification veneered with dressed masonry has as many as 12 semi-circular bastions at regular intervals. A spacious battlement is provided towards the inner side of the fortification. The fort has entrances decorated with cut plasterwork at the east and west. The entrances are quite small, comfortable enough for the horses of yore. The bastions are provided with gun points built with lime and brick. The house in which Tipu and Hyder Ali lived also still exists. The house of Dewan Purnaiah, a high-ranking official in Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan's court, is also located inside the fort. 200px Tipu's birthplace 200px A memorial with a small plaque stands south-west outside of the fort, stating that Tipu Sultan was born here in 1751. It is about six feet (2 m) tall with a pillared enclosure and square top and bears a stone tablet. The area around the enclosure is known as Khas Bagh and has a dried up stone pond, banana, tamarind and mango plantations. Temples inside the fort Venugopalaswamy temple The small town inside the strong walls of Devanahalli fort has many temples. The Venugopalaswamy temple, which faces the main town road is one of the oldest among them. The courtyard, with a Garuda Stamba, is spacious and the walls of the temple depict various scenes from Ramayana and the feats of Lord Krishna as a child, and the pillars have beautiful statues carved on them. The sculptures in this temple is said to be comparable to the temples of Belur and Halebid. On the pillars of the main entrance stand two horsemen with swords unsheathed. The Garbhagriha has a standing Venugopala image of Vijayanagara style. There is a Dravidian style Shikhara over the temple. The Navaranga has four black-stoned pillars carved with fine relief sculptures on all sides, such as hayagriva, dancing female figures with attendant musicians, a conch blower, a kinnara with the lower portion of his body in bird form, a huntress removing a thorn from her leg, etc. A teru is the big chariot used to parade the idol of Gopalaswamy around the town once a year. A few yards away from the Venugopalaswamy temple is Siddalingeshwara temple. Next to this temple is a Raghavendraswamy Math. Across the street is another age old temple, Chandramouleshwara Temple. It has a spacious inner prakara is built in Vijayanagara style. The Garbhagriha has a shivalinga, and there are two cells on either sides with images of Ganapati and Parvati enshrined respectively. On the left of the main road stands another temple dedicated to Anjaneya known as Sarovaranjaneya temple. The Nanjundeshwara temple is a small building with two cells in a line and a common navaranga. It is said that this was earlier called Kashi Vishveshwara and is regarded as the oldest temple in the town.

His father owned Haviland & Co., a well-known china manufacturer in Limoges, and his mother was the daughter of art critic Philippe Burty. His family was very wealthy for the time, and Haviland grew up surrounded by art, music and theater. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Paris, and from 1899 to 1902 went to graduate school at Harvard University. After graduating he worked from 1901 to 1917 in New York as a representative of his father's china firm. He did so to please his father, but in reality he spent as little time as possible in his office. Loraine Wyman, American soprano and folksong fieldworker, as portrayed by photographer Paul Burty- Haviland wearing representative performance attire (here, Breton peasant costume), some time in the mid 1910s. In early 1908 he and his brother Frank, who was a photographer, went to see the exhibition of Rodin drawings at the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, where he met Stieglitz. Both he and his brother bought works from the exhibit, and soon he and Stieglitz were engaged in long discussions about art and culture. Haviland considered the gallery \\"a unique oasis of cultivation\\" and soon spent most of his time there. A few months later, Stieglitz told him the gallery was going to close because of a substantial increase in the rent, and without telling Stieglitz Haviland went to the landlord and signed a three-year lease for an even larger space directly across the hall. Stieglitz was so appreciative of Haviland's generosity that for the next decade the two were nearly inseparable friends and colleagues. Beginning in 1909, Haviland began writing regular columns for Stieglitz's journal Camera Work, and later that year one of his photographs was published in the magazine (Portrait – Miss G.G., No 28, October). A year later he was named associate editor. He also functioned as secretary of the gallery and helped organize many of the shows of French artists. \\"Miss G.G.\\" by Paul Haviland. Published in Camera Work, No 28, 1909In 1912 Haviland won first prize in annual John Wanamaker Exhibition of Photographs in Philadelphia (judged by Stieglitz). A few months later six more of his photographs were published in Camera Work (No 39, 1912). In 1913 Haviland co-authored, with Marius de Zayas, one of the first extended essays on modern art, \\"A Study of the Modern Evolution of Plastic Expression (New York, 1913).\\" \\"Miss Doris Keane\\" by Paul Haviland. Published in Camera Work, No 39, 1912 In 1914 his brother Frank Burty had one-man show at Stieglitz's gallery, which by then was known as \\"291\\". Later that year two more of Haviland's photos were published in Camera Work (No 46). In 1915 Haviland teamed up with two other people who had become regulars at \\"291\\", Agnes Ernest Meyer and de Zayas. They were frustrated with Stieglitz handling of artists at the time and felt the galley had become stuck in a rut. They proposed a new publication to help re-energize both Stieglitz and the gallery. Haviland soon became one of the driving forces and editors of a new and then radical magazine, also called 291 after the gallery. For the next year Haviland put much of his energy into editing and publishing the magazine with his co-workers. In 1916 his father summoned him back to France to deal with the family business in Limoges. Due to his father's poor health he remained in France, and the next year he married Suzanne Lalique, daughter of famous art nouveau glass designer René Lalique. While in France Haviland corresponded frequently with Stieglitz, but because of his new bride and his increasing involvement in the family's business he never returned to New York. His father died in 1922 and for several years Haviland was completely absorbed by legal entanglements concerning the ownership of the business. The estate was finally settled in 1925, and afterward he used his share of the estate to purchase a 17th-century priory in Yzeures-sur-Creuse. He turned the grounds into a vineyard and spent the rest of his life making wine and living as a gentleman farmer.

HistoryRevised Student Handbook, La Limarisa Printing Press, Manila: 2015. Espiritu Santo Parochial School (ESPS) was formally established in 1947 by Rev. Fr. William J. Duschak, SVD (school director, 1947-1951), former Vicar Apostolic of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro. Not long after, the school, then managed by the priests of the Society of the Divine Word (SVD), was officially recognized by the government to offer the complete elementary course from Grade I to Grade VII courses in 1948 and the Kindergarten course in 1962. Serving after Fr. Duschak was Fr. Matias Buendgen, SVDBell 2, Espiritu Santo Parish, 1954 (school director, 1951-1958) who was credited for the construction of the Main Building, which stands at the corner of Rizal Avenue and Tayuman Street. Blessed by Archbishop Rufino J. Santos in November 1955, the said structure was then described as a “beautiful, imposing edifice” and was considered to be “one of the best parochial school buildings in Manila” after its construction. When Fr. Buendgen left for Germany in 1958, Fr. Antonio Albrecht, SVD, took over as the school director (served 1958-1973). Under his leadership ESPS grew by “leaps and bounds”. Fr. Albrecht added one more story to the Main Building, which eventually became the School Auditorium. It was under his administration that the Annex I and II buildings were built in succession with the former in the corner of Tayuman and Oroquieta Streets and the latter at Oroquieta corner Batangas Streets. In 1973, the SVD Fathers formally turned over ESPS to the diocesan priests, following the transfer of the parish supervision from the said congregation to the Archdiocese of Manila. Msgr. Gorgonio Encarnacion was the first diocesan priest to serve as school director on 1973-1981. The Religious Missionaries of St. Dominic took over the school’s management in 1981 with Sr. Ma. Cristina Castro, O.P. as the first school directress (served 1981-1982). Under the vision of the Dominican Sisters, the school initiated the much-needed reforms in the curricular offerings and further improved the physical facilities to ensure academic excellence, heighten spiritual awareness and create a healthy environment conducive to learning. Thus, the Audio Visual Room was constructed in 1984 and a year after, the Science Laboratory in the Main Building was built. The construction of both facilities were made possible by the Parents Auxiliary Board during the term of Sr. Mary Martires, O.P. as school directress (served 1982-1985). Consistent to avowed school aims, ESPS never ceased to upgrade and improve the quality of instruction. The year 1997 under Sr. Ma. Rosalinda Calong, O.P. (school directress, 1997-2001) saw a myriad of significant changes in the school set- up both in the curricular programs and the physical plant. To date, the school is equipped with modern facilities: the Instructional Media Center (IMC), computer laboratories, fully air-conditioned offices and classrooms, well- ventilated cafeterias, electronically catalogued libraries, a functional audio-visual room, a covered catwalk connecting the Main Building and the Annex I, the installation of the MIS (Management Information System) and a Wide Area Network (WAN) Internet. In 2007, the school prioritized the completion of the five-floor Annex II building in Oroquieta Street. By 2008, Annex II, which serves as the Grade School building, was completed. A year after, the covered court/gym located between the Annex I and the Main Building in Tayuman Street was already in use. Parallel to this facelift effort is the continuous review and revision of school programs and services to ensure the development of the learners. It was in March 2000 that the Religious Missionaries of St. Dominic formally entrusted the administration and supervision of ESPS to Manila Archdiocesan and Parochial Schools Association (MAPSA) under the leadership of Msgr. Alberto G. Salonga Jr. (served 2001-2014) as Director and Sr. Ma. Rosalinda F. Calong, O.P. as principal (served 2001-2014). Through the years, the school community continuously commits itself towards the realization of its vision-mission coupled with a deep sense of dedication and firm resolve by renewing its ties to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila Educational System (RCAM ES) in May 2014 following the formal transfer of supervisory reins from MAPSA to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila (RCAM). To date, Rev. Fr. Nolan A. Que, Ph.D. heads ESPS as the school director/principal (2014–present). Under his administration, the construction of a six-story building in Tayuman Street began. When completed, this building will house the school parking space, additional classrooms, the canteen extension and a roof deck gymnasium. During the first year of his term the school libraries and science laboratories were renovated. Accreditation In 1998, ESPS applied for academic accreditation to the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), a “private, voluntary, non-profit and non-stock corporation” that “recognizes academic programs which meet standards of quality education”. PAASCU analyzed and evaluated the school’s curriculum, student services, facilities, Faculty and staff development. In August 1999, the school passed the First Preliminary Survey in which it successfully met its standards and requirements for Level I, thus making the school eligible for Formal Survey. In May 2000, ESPS passed the Formal Survey and was awarded with PAASCU Level I Accreditation. Consequently, the school was granted the Level II status in May 2002 and was recommended for the Re-Survey three years after. Hence, ESPS prepared for the PAASCU Re-survey accreditation in November and December 2004. By May 2005, the Grade School and High School departments were granted Level II re-accreditation for a period of five years. In November 2010, ESPS was granted its latest PAASCU Level II re-accreditation, recognition of the school’s continuous work in improving its standards of academic and professional excellence.

The school was started in 1907 to provide Catholic education for children of European and Anglo-Indian descent. History =The first 25 years= St. Bede's School was born in 1907. When Lord Curzon announced the scheme of European education for the whole of India, His Lordship the Bishop of Mylapore, Dom Theotonius Emmanuel Rebeiro Vieire de Castro, decided to start a school separate from the San Thome High School for the benefit of the Anglo-Indian children. The \\"Leland’s Garden\\", a building on the Santhome High Road which now forms part of the C.S.I. School for Deaf & Dumb, was rented to house the new school. These premises were taken over later for housing the present school for deaf and dumb. On 18 January 1907, St Bede's (then known as St. Bede's European High School) was formally blessed and declared open by its reverend founder – His Lordship the Bishop of Mylapore - Dom Theotonius Emmanuel Rebeiro Vieira de Castro. The school began in 1907 with six classes: Standard II to Standard VII, and with Rev. Fr. M.I. Anacleto as its first Headmaster. Seventeen inmates of the San Thome Orphanage who were studying in the San Thome High School were brought on to the rolls of the new School. A new boarding (The St. Bede's Boarding) was started with just three students. These, with the 35-day scholars, brought the strength of the school to 55 in the first year. The San Thome Orphanage (also started by the founder of St. Bede's) and the St. Bede's Boarding were always considered part of St. Bede's School, as their inmates were pupils of the School. Rev. Fr. M.J. Salgado was the Director of the Boarding House and Rev. Fr. D’Costa was in charge of the Orphanage. In 1908, when Fr Anacleto went on leave, Fr. Salgado took over as headmaster. The first high school class was begun in 1909 and science was introduced. Don Bosco 'Father and Teacher of Youth' (statue inside the school) In 1909 the Bishop of Mylapore invited the Selesian Fathers to take over the San Thome Orphanage, which had been under the direct management of the mission of Mylapore. Rev. Fr. George Tomatis, S.D.B., who was then working in Tanjore, was called upon to shoulder the new responsibility as the Director. An exceptionally gifted man, Fr. Tomatis was a multi-linguist. As a boy, he had been in personal contact with Don Bosco and he had served the Saint's mass for three years. The first batch of High School candidates from St. Bede's appeared for the European High School Examination in December 1909. Joseph Sears secured the first rank in the Madras Presidency. He was later killed on the battlefield in France during the First World War. In 1913, work started on a new building (the one on the northern end of the San Thome Orphanage compound). Rev. Fr. J.J. Lopez became the School's First Correspondent. Among the newcomers on the staff that year was Rev. Fr. Francis A Carvalho, who later became the auxiliary Bishop of Madras and Mylapore. The same year, Joseph B. Figredo (later Rev. Fr. J B Freeman, and Principal of St. Bede's from 1944) secured the first rank in the Presidency. He was the only candidate to get a First Class in Madras. In 1914, Fr. Villa Verde took charge as Principal and saw the school through the First World War. He proved to be one of the most outstanding Principals of St. Bede's. On 29 April 1914, the new building was blessed by Bishop of Mylapore and inaugurated by the Hon. Justice Sir John Wallis, Kt. The boarding is housed in \\"Bethany House\\" and the Orphanage in the Old Parish Hall (now the Community Hall which is opposite Santhome Basilica). While the school moved into the new building, the boarders were moved into a separate building, the present \\"Church View\\" on Rosary Church Road. In the war years some of the older pupils were mobilized into the Volunteer Corps. In 1920, Fr. Lopez Pires was appointed Principal and Correspondent. In 1921, Fr. Villa Verde returned from Europe and took charge as Principal and Correspondent. In 1922, Mr. G.C. D’Cruz was appointed as Headmaster – the first layman to hold the post. About this time there was great enthusiasm for the Scout movement and 24 of the school youngsters who had passed the Tenderfoot examination were formed into the first school Scout troop. The school won the European Schools Athletic Association Championship for four years in succession. On 25 November 1925, St. Bede's and its affiliates received the news of the passing away of Rev. Fr. George Tomatis at St. Martha's Hospital in Bangalore. Fr. Thomatis was the leader of the first pioneering group of Salesians who came to India from Europe in 1906, he directed the San Thome Orphanage from 1901 till his death in 1925 at the age of sixty. Fr. Hanker, S.D.B. takes charge of the Orphanage. The steady increase in the requests for seats in the Boarding House necessitated moving out a third time in 1926. The unit now shifted to ‘Bainten’, a vacant house on the San Thome High Road. The Orphanage too had grown – from 35 boys in 1909 to 280 boys in 1928, when the Salesians handed the institution back to the Mylapore Mission. This change was necessary because the Salesians were needed at the Archdiocese of Madras, which had been given to their charge. The Rev. Fr. A. Neves of the diocese of Mylapore took over the Orphanage from the Salesians. On 5 March 1930, Lt. Col. The Hon’ble Sir George Stanley, in the presence of Lady Stanley, laid the foundation stone of the New Building and Boarding House building, which now forms part of the present Eastern Wing of our School building. In September 1930, St. Bede's got a Bus – \\"The Old Grunter\\". The new Bishop of Mylapore, Dom Antonio Maria Texeira, began making plans for expansion. One half of the structure planned was ready in about two years time and the school and the boarding house moved into it. In July 1931, Mr. R.E. Davey joined the staff. The following year, in April 1932, the Founder Dom Theotonius de Castro, who had by then been made Patriarch of the East Indies, visited the School and blessed the new building. The ground floor was utilized for classrooms, the upper floor being used as residential quarters. St. Bede's School and the Boarding thus found a permanent home in 1932, its Silver Jubilee year which was celebrated in September with the formal inauguration of the new building by Hon. Chief Justice Sir Owen Beasley. =26th year - 50th year= On 15 March 1933, the Bishop Texeira died suddenly of a heart attack. In January 1935, Rev. Fr. B.A. Figredo joined the staff. In March that year, Fr. Ville Verde retired after twenty-one years of service as Principal and left for Europe. Rev. Fr. Lopez took over from him as Principal. In 1937, the School received recognition for Senior Cambridge. In 1937, Fr. Figredo acted for Fr. Lopez, who went to Portugal. Fr. Lawrence Pereira was appointed as Procurator. In 1938, Fr. Lopez returned and was appointed as Boarding Master. The Second World War upset the smooth working of the School. On 12 March 1942, St Bede's was ordered to evacuate to Coimbatore and share a building with St. Patrick's of Adyar. As the accommodation was inadequate, St. Bede's decided to move to Tanjore. Mr. G.C. D’Cruz resigned that year. A Catholic gentleman, Mr. Arulanandaswamy Nadar, placed a spacious ground at the disposal of the School. The Rev. Fr. B.A. Figredo, Headmaster of St. Anthony's Tanjore, permitted St. Bede's to use his classrooms. In August 1943, the Orphanage and Chapel was gutted by fire and the school at Madras was occupied by the military authorities. In 1944, Fr. Fr Lopez retired and Fr. J.B. Freeman, M.A., L.T., Ph.D., became the Principal. In January 1945 Fr. B.A. Figredo is made the Principal and it was in Tanjore that Mr. G.V. D’Netto joined the School. After the war the military vacated the school and St. Bede's returned to Madras on 8 July 1946. Classes started again on 10 July 1946. The buildings used by the military were left in a very shabby condition. Fr. Figredo and his team had a Herculean task putting the building back into working order. In 1952, the two Dioceses of Madras and Mylapore were reorganized. Some portions of the old Mylapore Diocese were joined and the old Archdiocese of Madras forming the new Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore, with The Most Rev. Dr. Louis Mathias as its first Archbishop. Thus St. Bede's, which had so far been under the diocese of Mylapore, now came under the new Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore. In 1953, Fr. G. Lawson was appointed General Prefect and Assistant Headmaster. Archbishop Dr. Louis Mathias soon moved his headquarters to San Thome and set about his task. In 1954, he gave orders to demolish the military sheds that were being used as classrooms and to complete the construction of the main block, one half of which had been completed in 1932 by Bishop Texeira. Along the eastern end of the campus he put up the building, which now serves as the kitchen, dining hall and infirmary. The Archbishop then handed over the Old Parish Hall to the school to be used as a chapel. The New Block (Western Wing) was completed and housed Std VI and Std VII with the chapel upstairs. When all the buildings were ready, he moved the orphanage also in, thus forming one unit with the boarding. In 1955, Mr. F.M. Theobald retired after 35 years of service. In 1956, the Archbishop invited the Salesians to take over the institution. A Group of Salesians, with Rev. Fr. Tuena as its First Rector and Correspondent, and Rev. Fr. J.P. Mallon as its First Salesian Principal, took over in January 1956. Thus, St. Bede's was passed on to the care of the Salesians of Don Bosco. The year of transition passed quietly, ringing in the Golden Jubilee Year, 1957. When Rev. Fr. Mallon went on leave in January, Rev. Fr. Ittyachen, S.D.B. B.Sc., B.T. took over as its first Indian Principal until June and then Mr. R.E. Davey is appointed as its acting Headmaster.

A primitive Eastern Roman Christian church stood on the site, and some researchers have identified this with the one built in the 6th century by Emperor Justinian I. This was replaced by the old Great Mosque of Ceuta, an architectural work of enormous wealth, according to descriptions which have survived, and although it underwent several enlargements, hardly any remains of it are to be seen today. After the Portuguese conquest of 1415, the Great Mosque was transformed into a Christian church by alterations, but there is no record of what they were. The passage of time and damage suffered by warlike incidents caused the ruin of the building, and at the end of the 17th-century it was decided to replace it by a new church designed by the architect Juan de Ochoa. Building work began in 1686, but many difficulties were suffered in the years which followed as a result of a great siege to which Ceuta was subjected, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1726, when it was dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady. Attached to the cathedral, there is a building housing the Vicariate, Secretariat, Diocesan Archive, Library, Cathedral Museum, and other offshoots of the diocese, and there is also the bishop's palace, which surrounds a small triangular courtyard. Important sights in the cathedral are the Chapel of the Most Holy Trinity, a Baroque altarpiece, and frescoes by Miguel Bernardini, besides three large canvases and a 15th-century figure of the Great Virgin, which is of Portuguese origin.

Marshall finished as runner-up in the 2008 C-USA Baseball Tournament, falling in the finals to Houston, 3–2, but winning a MU record 30 games without a home field to use in Huntington for the entire season. For the first time since 1994, MU had players drafted in the June 5–6 Major League Baseball Draft with a school-record three being selected, plus one recruit in 2008. Steve Blevins, who tied the single-season wins mark with a 9–3 mark, signed with the Minnesota Twins on June 11, while Nate Lape was drafted by the Colorado Rockies and Tommy Johnson by the Seattle Mariners. Lape and second baseman Adam Yeager played in the Cape Cod League, the premier wooden bat summer college baseball league, for the Brewster Whitecaps. In 2015, outfielder Corey Bird was an All-Cape Cod League selection, then hit .300 for the 2016 Herd and led C-USA in stolen bases. In 2016, Marshall finished second in C-USA by 1/2 game behind Florida Atlantic, and the Herd advanced to the semi-finals of the C-USA Tournament, losing to eventual champ Southern Miss on the Golden Eagles home stadium, 3–2, in the semis and finishing 2–2 in the tourney. The Herd won a Marshall record 34 games (and lost only 21), posted the first winning season since 1994 and made the C-USA Tournament for the first time since 2010. Marshall was 13–2 in the final five series of the year in the league games and swept three in a row on the way to winning eight C-USA series, also an all-time high. Senior Chase Boster became Marshall's biggest winning when he passed both Albie DeYoung and Grant Harper with his 20th win of his career, finishing 8–3 on the season. Houston vs. Marshall in the 2010 Conference USA Baseball Tournament Marshall has an all-time record of 1,363–1,532–12 (at end of 2016 season, 110 seasons all-time since 1896).\\"2011 Marshall Baseball Media Guide .\\" 2011 Marshall University Baseball Media Guide Retrieved on March 16, 2011. Unlike most Division I baseball programs, Marshall did not have a full-time home stadium. Due to Conference USA standards, it played non-conference games at Kennedy Center Field, a community baseball field just outside Huntington. Due to its limited amenities for both fans and players, Marshall has played conference games at Appalachian Power Park in Charleston, more than 50 miles from campus. Select games were also played at Linda K. Epling Stadium in Beckley, 110 miles from campus. Upgrades to the Kennedy Center Field allowed Marshall to play all its games at beginning in 2019, with the exception of games versus rivals WVU and Virginia Tech, which draw a larger crowd than the Kennedy Center can accommodate and will continue to be played in Charleston. In 2018, the school purchased land for a new stadium near campus which will fully be adequate for baseball purposes.

A right arm fast-medium bowler, Sutherland made his first- class debut against Queensland at the St Kilda Cricket Ground, where one of his opponents, Scott Muller, was also debuting. He claimed Carl Rackemann as his maiden wicket and in the second innings dismissed Stuart Law for the first of his two-second innings victims. The following week the Victorians defeated New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield Final but the paceman had lost his place in the side to Paul Jackson and instead was relegated to 12th man. In his three other first-class appearances he chipped in with the occasional wicket but was unable to take a big haul. He did however take some big wickets, including Justin Langer twice and against Tasmania he dismissed Ricky Ponting hit wicket. As Cricket Australia chief executive, Sutherland would later work alongside the Australian captain, as he did with Steve Waugh whom he also took the wicket of during his career, on his List A debut. He was part of Victoria's 1992/93 Mercantile Mutual Cup campaign and played in the Final which they lost to New South Wales.

The team's 4,417 wins as of the 2017 season are the most of any NCAA Division I baseball team. This is mainly because Fordham began playing baseball well before many collegiate baseball powers took up the sport. For example, Texas, currently second on the all-time wins list, did not field a baseball team until 1894, 34 years after Fordham. Nonetheless, the Rams heavily stress their status as the winningest program in college baseball history in recruiting. The Rams have reached six NCAA Tournaments, most recently in 2019.Curry, Jack. For 150 Years, Fordham Baseball’s Tradition of Winning, The New York Times, April 5, 2009. Accessed April 6, 2009. History Tobacco card circa 1910 Founded in the late 1850s, the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club of St. John's College (the precursor to Fordham University, and of no connection at all to St. John's University) played against St. Francis Xavier College in the first ever college baseball game under modern nine-man-team rules (Knickerbocker Rules, or \\"The New York Game\\") on November 3, 1859. There have been 56 major leaguers who have played for Fordham, including All-Star pitcher Pete Harnisch and Baseball Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch. Frisch, a star athlete in four different sports at Fordham, was known as the \\"Fordham Flash\\". Steve Bellán, a Cuban who attended what was then St. John's College from 1863 to 1868, played in the major leagues, primarily as a third baseman, and was the first Latin American in professional baseball. Gil McDougald, who played for the New York Yankees, was a coach on the team. Announcer Vin Scully, who played outfield at Fordham before achieving greater fame in the broadcast booth, hit one home run in his Fordham career, which included a game against George H.W. Bush who was playing for Yale University. Fordham's most recent Hall of Fame inductee class in 2012 included a member of the baseball team, Bob Cole. In honor of the 150th anniversary of the team's first game, Fordham played Williams College, which was also celebrating its sesquicentennial of baseball play. University President Joseph M. McShane, who had conceived of the anniversary game, threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the game. Williams had lost to Amherst College July 1, 1859 and considered the first college baseball game under the now defunct Massachusetts rules, losing 73-32. Home field The team plays home games at Jim Houlihan Park at Jack Coffey Field. Jack Coffey Field, a multisport facility, is named after Jack Coffey, former athletic director and baseball coach at the University. He amassed 817 wins as a baseball coach. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox).

Early years Olivieri Sánchez was born in Yauco, Puerto Rico, when the island was still a Spanish possession. He was a native inhabitant of Puerto Rico and a Spanish subject, though not of the Peninsula (Spain). Olivieri Sánchez was still residing in the island when the United States annexed Puerto Rico after the Spanish–American War in 1898 and Spain had lost its last colony in the western hemisphere. United States occupation of Puerto Rico The United States established a military government, which acted as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs. Almost immediately, the United States began the \\"Americanization\\" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economy and polity and did not apply democratic principles in their colony. Puerto Rico was classified as an \\"unincorporated territory,\\" which meant that the protections of the United States Constitution — including the right of citizenship — did not automatically apply, because the island belonged to the U.S., but was not part of the U.S. One of the conditions of the treaty was the transfer by cession the allegiance of the islanders to the United States. Olivieri Sánchez was a citizen of Puerto Rico, but not of the United States even though the island was governed by that nation. Situation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane San Ciriaco On August 8, 1899, Hurricane San Ciriaco, with winds of over 100 miles per hour, struck Puerto Rico and, on August 22, another hurricane followed. The floods caused by 28 days of continuous rain damaged the agricultural industry and left 3,400 dead and thousands of people without shelter, food or work.Hurricane San Ciriaco As a result, there was a shortage of sugar from the Caribbean in the world market and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii and other sugar producing countries. To meet the demand, plantation owners from Hawaii began a campaign to recruit the jobless laborers in Puerto Rico. First Puerto Rican immigrants to Hawaii Type of Steamship in which Puerto Ricans immigrated to Hawaii. On November 22, 1900, the first group of Puerto Ricans consisting of 56 men, began their long journey to Maui, Hawaii. The trip was long and unpleasant. They first set sail from San Juan harbor to New Orleans, Louisiana. Once in New Orleans, they were boarded on a railroad train and sent to Port Los Angeles, California. From there they set sail aboard the Rio de Janeiro to Hawaii. According to the \\"Los Angeles Times\\" dated December 26, 1901, the Puerto Ricans were mistreated and starved by the shippers and the railroad company. They arrived in Honolulu, on December 23, 1900, and were sent to work in different plantations on Hawaii's four islands.Los Angeles Times December 26, 1901 By October 17, 1901, 5,000 Puerto Rican men, women and children had made their new homes on the four islands. Records show that, in 1902, 34 plantations had 1,773 Puerto Ricans on their payrolls; 1,734 worked as field hands and another 39 were clerks or overseers (foremen). Wages and living accommodations depended upon their jobs and race. Europeans were paid more and were given better living quarters. Most of the workers moved from plantation to plantation to work because they did not like the work they did and because of the racial discrimination. Manuel Olivieri Sánchez travels to Hawaii In 1900, when Olivieri Sánchez was 12 years old, his father died. That same year, the United States passed the Foraker Act establishing the territorial status of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican citizenship in accordance to Section VII. Therefore, Puerto Ricans were not entitled to the same rights that citizens of the United States had,Race Space and the Puerto Rican citizenship even though the island was governed by that nation.U.S. Supreme Court, Retrieved September 3, 2008 Olivieri Sánchez's family financial situation worsened and in 1901, he moved to Hawaii with his mother. He became fluent in both English and Spanish and worked as a court interpreter. At the time Puerto Rico and Hawaii were unincorporated and incorporated territories of the United States respectively; however, the passage of the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917, same year that the U.S. entered World War I, granted U.S. citizenship to the Puerto Rican residents in Puerto Rico and excluded those who resided in Hawaii. Even though Puerto Ricans in Hawaii were excluded from U.S. citizenship, they were assigned draft numbers along with those who were citizens.\\"Images and Identities\\", By Asela Rodríguez-Seda de Laguna, Pgs. 101 -102; Publisher: Transaction Publishers; Plantation owners, like those that comprised the so-called Big Five, had an association called the \\"Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association\\" (HSPA), found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap labor overseas, especially from Puerto Rico and Asia. Such immigration was prohibited in various other states of the Union.Land and Power in Hawaii: The Democratic Years; by George Cooper, Gavan Daws; Published 1990; Publisher: University of Hawaii Press; Struggle for U.S. citizenship In 1917, Puerto Ricans in the island, believing that they were entitled to the same rights that every other U.S. citizens had, tried to sign up to vote in a local Hawaiian election and were denied their rights by David Kalauokalani, the county clerk, who claimed that early immigrants to Hawaii were not covered by the Jones Act. Olivieri Sánchez became enraged in what he viewed as a violation of the civil rights of his fellow countrymen. He encouraged his fellow Puerto Ricans to protest by telling them that \\"If you are not allowed to vote, don't answer the draft call\\". Olivieri Sánchez took a mandamus suit to court with the claim that all Puerto Ricans were United States citizens and entitled to the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, however the lower court ruled in favor of the county clerk.Hawaiian reports: cases decided in the Supreme Court of the ..., Volume 24, pages 21-26; By Hawaii Supreme Court; Publisher: General Books LLC (August 10, 2009); Olivieri Sánchez hired two liberal lawyers. Together they presented the case to the Territorial Supreme Court. The case known as \\"IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF MANUEL OLIVIERI SANCHEZ FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS AGAINST DAVID KALAUOKALANI\\" No. 1024, which was decided on October 22, 1917, reversed the lower court's decision. The Territorial Supreme Court recognized that all Puerto Ricans in Hawaii were citizens of the United States and were entitled to all rights of citizenship.\\"The Puerto Rican Diaspora\\", By Carmen Teresa Whalen; Pg. 47; Publisher: Temple University Press (August 30, 2005); Struggle against discrimination Olivieri Sánchez' victory was not welcomed by the members of HSPA, who depended on the cheap labor non-citizens provided. In 1930, HSPA began circulating false rumors. They made it known that they (HSPA) planned to recruit laborers in Puerto Rico, while at the same time they had the \\"Honolulu Star Bullentin\\" and other local newspapers they controlled run anti-Puerto Rican storiesclaiming, for example, that Puerto Ricans were \\"unhealthy hookwormers who had bought disease to Hawaii\\". In a Dec. 1931 letter to the editor of the \\"Hawaiian Advertiser,\\" Olivieri Sánchez wrote that he saw all of the rhetoric as a tactic by the HSPA to push the different ethnic groups in the local labor force back to work on the plantations. He was right, the HSPA wanted to persuade Congress to exempt the territory from a law, which in 1924 was requested by California to prevent the migration of Filipinos and Japanese nationals to the U.S. (National Origins Quota Action (Immigration Act) and Johnson Immigration Act of 1924).Jim Crow Guide: The Way it Was, by Stetson Kennedy 1959 HSPA's secretary treasurer J. K. Butler claimed that the association was unwilling to import Puerto Ricans to Hawaii. His defamation of Puerto Ricans condemned not only the Puerto Ricans of Hawaii, but also those on the island. Despite the efforts of Olivieri Sánchez, HSPA had their way and Hawaii was exempted from the stern anti-immigration laws of the time. The power of the plantation owners was finally broken by the activist descendants of the original immigrant laborers. Because they were born in an incorporated United States territory and they were legal American citizens, they gained full local voting rights and actively campaigned for statehood for the Hawaiian Islands.Star Bullentin Legacy His efforts helped to make the United States citizenship, which was granted to the citizens of Puerto Rico by way of the Jones Act of 1917, to be extended to the Puerto Ricans living there.

Biodiversity banking provides a means to place a monetary value on ecosystem services. Typically this involves land protection, restoration, an/or enhancement. Biodiversity banking is often applied so that there is no \\"net loss of a particular biodiversity feature.\\" According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, by 2004, interest in voluntary biodiversity offsets was growing in the United States, Brazil, Australia, Canada and the EU. Experience suggested that industry, governments, local communities and conservation groups all benefit from biodiversity offsets or biodiversity banking. Terminology According to the IUCN, \\"[b]iodiversity offsets are designed to compensate for residual environmental damage caused by development after avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of environmental impacts have been considered and implemented. The goal of offsets is to compensate for the loss of biodiversity at one location with conservation gains elsewhere.\\" In practice In practice, biodiversity banks rely on existing governmental laws, which forbid companies or individuals of buying up land in an area that houses, say a critically endangered species. An exception is also in place in this governmental law which allows companies to buy up the land nonetheless, if they also buy a certain amount of compensation credits with a certified biodiversity bank. These credits, which represent a significant extra cost to the company, are then used to provide revenue for the biodiversity bank, but the revenue derived thereof is also used by the bank to buy up conservation area elsewhere for the endangered species.Banking Nature documentary United States In the United States a \\"mitigation banking\\" process applies to impacts on wetlands. It requires that developers firstly avoid harm to wetlands, but if harm is considered unavoidable, then wetland habitat of similar function and values must be \\"protected, enhanced or restored\\" to compensate for those that will be damaged. The process comes under the US Clean Water Act 1972 the US Army Corps of Engineers regulations http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/bdoffsets.pdf and the commitment to \\"no net loss\\" of wetlands habitat. Since about 2000 the term \\"species banking\\", sometimes called \\"conservation banking\\", has applied to impacts on species of special concern, typically those that are listed by state and federal agencies under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or its state- based equivalent. Similar to wetlands banks, conservation banks are designed as compensation for impacts to listed species or their habitat, ensuring a similar no net loss policy for these biodiversity resources. Compensation for impacts to a stream riparian zone may also be required in relation to the linear distance of lost stream functions resulting from stream bank structures (e.g., concrete or rip rap), sedimentation, channelization, dredging or similar activities. Australia Two biodiversity banking schemes operating in Australia are the New South Wales BioBanking scheme,Biodiversity Banking and Offsets Scheme (BioBanking) environment.nsw.gov.au which commenced in 2008, and the Victorian Native Vegetation Management Framework scheme. Both schemes apply particularly to developers, where biodiversity values will be reduced through land clearing and building development. The framework requires developers to source biodiversity credits through a market mechanism to offset biodiversity loss. Listed species, critical habitat, wetlands and stream habitat are all components of biodiversity ecosystem services. Taken collectively, they may be referred to as \\"biodiversity banks\\". Canada In Alberta, Canada, Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) researchers use the oil sands industry of Alberta as a case study in their paper in which they evaluated the commonly used and costly ecological equivalency-based biodiversity offset in terms of economic and ecological performance with more flexible alternative offset systems. They used ABMI's \\"empirically derived index of biodiversity intactness to link offsets with losses incurred by development.\\" They evaluated ecologically equivalent areas in regards to vegetation types and regional conservation priorities such as the recovery of the boreal woodland caribou and the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion in the oil sands region. They found that flexible alternative systems like the priority- focused offsetting networks, cost 2-17 times less than the ecological equivalency-based biodiversity offset vegetation cost 2–17 times more than priority-focused networks.

He remained at Swindon until the start of the 1907–08 season, when he moved to the south coast to join Portsmouth for a fee of £75. He played for Portsmouth for three years on a part-time basis, while working as a motor engineer. In his time at Fratton Park he performed consistently, but Portsmouth were unable to regain the league title, with a best finish of fourth in 1908–09. In October 1910, he was on the verge of retiring when he received an offer from Southampton. Beaumont therefore joined the \\"Saints\\", again on a part-time basis. He trained nightly at Fratton Park and only made contact with the Southampton team on match days. According to \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\", he was \\"never a brilliant player (but) was, nonetheless, versatile\\" and could play in any of the half back positions. He made his Southampton debut on 29 October 1910 in a 3–2 defeat at Brentford and only missed three matches as Saints finished the season just one point above the relegation places.

The route is recognized in the historic climbing text Fifty Classic Climbs of North America. The route was first climbed Oct. 1936 by Ken Adam, Morgan Harris, K. Kenneth Davis. The route is moderate in difficulty and is frequently climbed. The first 4 pitches are along a west facing dihedral. At Pitch 5, the route turns north and ascends the main face along crack systems. Pitch 10 can be free climbed at 5.10b however, most climbers use a fixed rope to pendulum to a long ledge. At the end of Pitch 15, begins the bolted rappel route. It is 18 rappels to the Valley floor. Some climbers prefer to continue to \\"The Jungle\\" at the end of Pitch 16. Beyond The Jungle is a 5.4 slab and 4th Class scrambling to the Valley Rim. The descent is usually accomplished by traversing northeast to Washington Column and descending the exposed North Dome Gully. The Royal Arches route has long been a popular free-solo, and the competition over the years has led to some astounding ascent times. Even as far back as 1979, the 15 pitch ascent was being done in under an hour. However, many people find themselves spending the night on the route. There have been several accidents on the route and rappel route. Leading the 11th Pitch of Royal Arches, August 1984. This was shortly after the famed rotten log fell on the original route.

Their crew consisted of 150 officers and crewmen.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 143 The main armament of the Mutsuki-class ships consisted of four Type 3 guns in single mounts; one gun forward of the superstructure, one between the two funnels and the last pair back to back atop the aft superstructure. The guns were numbered '1' to '4' from front to rear. The ships carried two above-water triple sets of 61-centimeter torpedo tubes; one mount was between the forward superstructure and the forward gun and the other was between the aft funnel and aft superstructure. Four reload torpedoes were provided for the tubes. They carried 18 depth charges and could also carry 16 mines. They could also fitted with minesweeping gear.

Mrs Slocombe is the Senior of the Ladies Department and known for her unusual hair colours, such as lime green, purple and orange. Throughout the series, her husband is alluded to as having either left Mrs Slocombe, or possibly been arrested by the Fraud Squad. In Grace and Favour, it is revealed that Mrs Slocombe's husband, Cecil, had walked out on her one morning (to buy slightly salted butter at Sainsbury's) and ended up a successful land developer. In one episode she accepts what she thinks is a marriage proposal from Mr Humphries, implying that she is now divorced from Mr Slocombe. Mrs Slocombe lives with her cat, Tiddles, which she refers to as \\"my pussy\\", and is the source of many a double entendre. Mrs Slocombe also tries to sound posh and refined, but when exasperated or annoyed, she reveals more than a trace of a northern accent. Mrs Slocombe's catch phrases include \\"...and I am unanimous in that...\\" and \\"Weak as water!\\" Mrs Slocombe often utters malapropisms when confronted with long words, rendering, for example: * \\"obstreperous\\" as \\"obstropulous\\" * \\"organism\\" as \\"orgasm\\" * \\"centimetres\\" as \\"centipedes\\". Much of her free time appears to be spent prowling public houses, roller rinks and discos with friends referred to variously as Mrs. Axelby, Mrs Elthrop, or others. Due to her middle age, men are less and less attracted to her, which she dismisses as politeness on the part of all men. Mrs Axelby and Tiddles aside, Mrs Slocombe's best friend appears to be Miss Brahms; in spite of their 28-year age difference; they are often seen gossiping, and take united stands against management. The three junior salesmen, Mr. Lucas, Mr. Humphries, and Mr. Spooner, constantly make sarcastic jokes and remarks about Mrs. Slocombe's sex life, age, appearance, size and weight. Nonetheless, Mr Humphries is also the most congenial towards her. In one instance, for example, when the department was facing the possibility of having an employee sacked, Mr. Humphries is quick to jump to Mrs Slocombe's defence. The five senior salesmen (Mr. Grainger, Mr. Tebbs, Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Grossman, and Mr. Klein) resent having to share the floor with her. In Mr. Grainger's case, it this starts as a response her area taking space he regarded as rightfully part of his department, while the others seem to half-heartedly maintain this dislike. In a number of episodes, namely \\"The Clock\\", \\"Cold Store\\", \\"German Week\\", \\"Do You Take This Man?\\", and \\"The Erotic Dreams Of Mrs Slocombe\\", she is shown to have a fondness for alcohol, mainly gin, and thus gets drunk. Mrs. Slocombe is very vain about her age, once claiming to be \\"only 46\\" and another time claiming to be in her 30s. However, in the episode \\"Fifty Years On\\", the staff determine that she was born in the 1920s (they also determine that she is 50), and in \\"Founders Day\\" Mr. Lucas announces her year of birth as 1926. In \\"The Junior\\", Captain Peacock threatens to reveal that she worked at Lyons as a nippy, possibly implying that she was at least in her late teens during World War II, although Lyons Corner Houses existed until 1977, so she could have worked there later. In the Second World War, as a child, Mrs. Slocombe was evacuated to Tiverton in Devon, where she worked on a farm as a Land Girl. As she grew older, she became an ARP Warden; in this role she met her husband, who saved her from a bomb in an air raid. She then became an ambulance driver, and was nearly killed by a land mine explosion on Clapham Common. She described the experience several times, saying: \\"I remember being thrown on my back in Clapham Common during an air raid ... the German air force was responsible.\\" Mr Lucas snarkily replied, \\"All the other times the American air force was responsible.\\" At various times, often while drunk, Mrs. Slocombe tried to flirt with various male staff members. Though she often sparred with Mr. Lucas, she was heard to remark that he had \\"very smooth hands\\" when he accidentally tries to straighten her stockings instead of a display dummy's, and she was very pleasant towards him in the early episodes (although he was young enough to be her son). Mrs. Slocombe often casts an eye towards Captain Peacock, usually calling him \\"Stephen\\" in a conspiratorial tone and complimenting him in an effort to appeal to his masculine ego. At one point, when pretending to be locked in a passionate embrace with Captain Peacock, Mrs Slocombe is overcome with the smell of his cologne, and comments that he is actually a rather handsome man. (On the other hand, when he once beckoned to her, she famously declared, with typical solemnity, \\"I do not respond to any man's finger.\\") She was occasionally known to smile and wink at Mr Humphries. Mrs Slocombe also once implied that she had a crush on Mr Spooner (although she was just saying this when she heard that he was a pop star; again, he was young enough to be her son). It is mentioned later on in the series that Mrs. Slocombe's residence is a block of flats at the end of a cul-de-sac backing onto a common. In series 7 Mrs. Slocombe's residence on the top floor of Grace Brothers resembles what Mrs Slocombe's home actually looks like. Mrs. Slocombe mentions on three occasions that she has a pet canary called Winston, who is seen in \\"The Apartment\\". She sometimes refers to her cat Tiddles as a male, even though Tiddles has given birth to two litters of kittens. In every episode, and sometimes during the episode, Mrs Slocombe's hair colour and style changes, and yet it is not mentioned by any of her fellow workers. Grace and Favour Mollie Sugden reprised the role of Mrs Slocombe for the spin-off show, Grace and Favour, in 1992 and 1993. Are You Being Served? (2016) BBC TV revived Are You Being Served? for a one-off revival in 2016, featuring Sherrie Hewson as Mrs Slocombe. In this single episode, Mrs Slocombe was portrayed with pink hair.

Career Stones made his Football League debut for Lincoln City as a 72nd-minute substitute for Worrell Sterling in the 4–0 home victory over Swansea City on 5 April 1997. Stones was aged just 16 years 309 days old and, at the time, the third youngest player to appear for the club in the Football League: he is currently the fourth after Jack Hobbs, Shane Nicholson and Carl Dawson. He spent the end of the 1999–2000 season on loan at Grantham Town, debuting in the 1–0 home defeat to Burton Albion on 1 April 2000 and making a total of seven league appearances for the club, scoring a solitary goal in the 6–0 home victory over Atherstone United on 8 April 2000.Jon Barnes, The Who's Who of Grantham Town Football Club, pp. 167, Gingerjonny Publications, 2005. It was no surprise that, after just 21 league appearances in three seasons as a professional, he was released by the Sincil Bank based club at the end of season. He dropped out of professional football to sign with Spalding United before moving onto Brigg Town in March 2001. Having spent some time with the club during the pre-season in November 2002 Stones signed for Gainsborough Trinity who were under the command of his former Lincoln coach Phil Stant. He made his Northern Premier League debut for the club in the 2–1 home victory over Colwyn Bay on 23 November 2002 and made a further eight league appearances, scoring a single goal in the 4–2 home victory over Worksop Town on 26 December 2002, before returning to Brigg Town in February 2003. He helped Brigg to secure the FA Vase that season, appearing in the 2–1 final victory over AFC Sudbury at Boleyn Ground on 10 May 2003. He moved to Sleaford Town in November 2006. Stones was forced to miss the entire 2007–2008 season after breaking his leg in two places just two minutes into a friendly with Lincoln Moorlands Railway on 7 July 2007, the first fixture at Sleaford's new Eslaforde Park ground. He returned to fitness ahead of the 2008–2009 season. He departed Sleaford Town in July 2009 to link up with his one-time Brigg Town manager Ralph Clayton at Bottesford Town. He remained with the club for a single season before returning to Sleaford Town ahead of the 2010–11 season.

Klarenthal was the only abbey in present-day Wiesbaden. History as an active monastery King Adolf of Nassau and his wife Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg in a mural at Klarenthal Abbey, drawing by H. Dors, 1632 Klarenthal Abbey was established in 1298 by Count Adolf of Nassau (born before 1250; died July 2, 1298), who was elected King of Germany on May 5, 1292. The monastery was to serve as a tomb for the House of Nassau, and Adolf's wife Queen Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg and many of his descendants were buried here. This continued until 1370, when, after the division of the Countship of Nassau, the preferred burial places became the central churches of the cities of residence of that particular branch of the House of Nassau. In 1429, Count Philipp I of Nassau- Weilburg-Saarbrücken was buried at Klarenthal. He was the last reigning member of the House of Nassau to be buried there. The monastery belonged to the woman's Order of Poor Ladies, also known as the Poor Clares, which was founded on St. Clare of Assisi, from which is derived the name Klarenthal. Many noble women of the surrounding area joined the monastery, in particular from the Rheingau and Rheinhessen. During the siege of Wiesbaden by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1318, Klarenthal Abbey was looted and destroyed. It was rebuilt, however, in the following years. One hundred years later, under the abbesses Paze of Lindau (1412?–1422) and Countess Agnes of Hanau (1446? – 1450), the monastery reached its heyday. Economically consolidated, it could also expand and decorate the ensemble of its monastic buildings. The cloister was redesigned and the church partly painted. The Mainz Diocesan Feud (1461–1462) presented a setback. Although the monastery was unaffected in the conflict, many of the properties from which the monastery's income was generated were destroyed. The monastery eventually recovered economically. In the late 15th century and early 16th century, however, Klarenthal Abbey found it increasingly difficult to attract young women. The local gentry, from which most of the nuns once came, found itself falling behind the middle class economically and no longer wanted to pay the high entrance fees for admission to the monastery. Also the reputation of monasteries suffered during the late Middle Ages, so that entry into a monastery had lower social prestige. The medieval idea faded that a member of a family in a monastery performed a valuable service by praying for the deceased of her family. The Protestant Reformation, which turned its back on the monastic life, sounded its death knell in the areas where it prevailed, legitimizing the seizure of the monasteries by the local lord. From 1553 Count Philip III, Count of Nassau- Weilburg began to take steps to dissolve the monastery. He transferred the documents and records stored there into his own possession. By no longer issuing the necessary permits, he prevented the monastery from receiving novices or choosing a new abbess. He adopted a policy of allowing its membership to decline through attrition. In 1559, the remaining five nuns accepted the Count's proposal to leave the monastery in exchange for appropriate compensation. This, however, did not legally abolish the monastery since, according to the Augsburg Interim, the Count needed the Pope's consent. Nevertheless, the monastery was secularized in 1559. Later use Initially, the assets of Klarenthal Abbey were used to assist the poor, run by priests and teachers paid by the Countship. In 1607 the buildings were transformed into a state hospital by Count Louis II of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1632 or 1650, the epitaphs of the Counts of Nassau and their relatives interred at Klarenthal were dismantled and set up in the Mauritius Church in Wiesbaden, where they would later be destroyed in the Great Fire of 1850. In the Thirty Years War, the buildings of Klarenthal Abbey were heavily damaged. The church was without a roof, declined to ruin, and was eventually demolished in 1756. During a time of Catholic rule during the war, the Kloster was once again used as monastery, this time of the Jesuit order. But in 1650, it was again yielded. In 1706 it became a factory for glass. This operation existed until 1723, when a fire severely damaged the facility. From 1724, it then became a paper mill. This lasted until 1840 when another fire damaged the building and this use ended. In 1730, the small settlement, which had formed around the factory, erected a chapel, which was overseen by a pastor from Wiesbaden. Remains Of the original monastery buildings, little remains visible after to the repeated destruction. The present buildings partially use the foundations of the monastery buildings and in some places the walls preserve medieval stonework, including some of the arcades of the cloister. Also, spolia can be seen in various places. Anything else remaining of the original monastery is invisible to all but archaeologists.

It deals with the life of Arthur Stace who was known as \\"The Eternity Man\\" because he chalked the word \\"Eternity\\" about 500,000 times in over 35 years on Sydney's walls and footpaths. The opera is written for four voices. These include the voice of Stace himself (baritone) and three female characters (soprano, mezzo- soprano, contralto) who represent alternatively Stace's sister, Myrtle; a Darlinghurst brothel keeper; and an assortment of female choruses – female freaks at the Sydney Royal Easter Show and also ghosts of female convicts and a gaggle of Kings Cross drag queens. A performance lasts for about 70 minutes. Performance history The work was commissioned by and premiered at London's Almeida Theatre on 23 July 2003, conducted by Stuart Stratford, production by Benedict Andrews, with singers Richard Jackson, Tara Harrison, Claire McCaldin and Andee-Louise Hippolite. The work had one Australian season, at the Sydney Festival in January 2005. That performance at the Sydney Opera House Studio, conducted by Richard Gill included the singers Grant Smith, Christa Hughes, Belinda Montgomery, Inara Molinari.

It lies approximately north of Kawęczyn, south of Turek, and south- east of the regional capital Poznań. The village has a population of 190.  History  Village Kowale existed already in the 13th century. Bought by Archbishop Jakub Świnka around 1280 it remained the property of the Gniezno Archdiocese until the 18th century. The name Kowale appeared in the 17th century, in reference to a community of blacksmiths (kowale in Polish) servicing local market. The church, founded by Antoni Czarnecki, was built in 1847; the church's parish included 12 villages. In mid 19th century, during the Partitions of Poland, the population of Kowale Pańskie (and the adjacent Wola Kowalska) was only 323 people, half of whom lived and worked around the local historic manor (built in 1750), owned by industrialist Robert Schultz who run a steam-powered mill. Kowale Pańskie consisted of 30 farms. The inhabitants was predominantly Polish, with some German and even fewer Jewish families. Following Poland's return to independence Kowale became the county seat (gmina) in 1928 consisting of 59 settlements. Volunteer fire station was built, a school complex (1933), and a community bank (Gminna Kasa Pożyczkowo- Oszczędnościowa). = World War II and the Holocaust = With the German invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, Kowale became part of Turek Kreis in Reichsgau Wartheland territory annexed directly to Nazi Germany. Kowale county was chosen as the location of a transit ghetto for Polish Jews from the entire region spanning 16 settlements including Turek. Also in: The ghetto – centred around Czachulec – was known in German as Heidemühle in reference to an old windmill standing there; all Polish families were expelled from the zone with younger Poles taken to Germany for slave labour. The Nazis ordered the creation of a single Judenrat council for all Jewish communities together. The ghetto held 3,700 Jews; up to 18 families per each farmhouse living anywhere they could including in barnyards. In October 1941, SS- Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange chose nearby Chełmno as the location of the first ever extermination camp. Also in: The gas vans manufactured in Berlin were delivered some time in November. On 8 November 1941, all Jews from the Kowale Pańskie Ghetto were herded in the village of Bielawki for a selection. About 1,100 people were declared \\"incapable of work\\" and on 13–14 November transported to the death camp in Chełmno. The younger and stronger men in Kowale were deported to forced labour near Poznań in early 1942, followed by a group of Jewish women. The final liquidation of the ghetto took place on 20 July 1942, when the remaining Jews were sent to Chełmno, but also murdered outside the village, along with Jewish hospital patients and 12 Jewish policemen. The inhabitants of Babiak, Dąbie, Dęby Szlacheckie, Grodziec, Izbica Kujawska, Kłodawa, Koło, Nowiny Brdowskie, and Sompolno were deported to Chełmno before March 1943.
