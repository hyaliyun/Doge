Although not one of the original Charlestown founders of 1629, on arrival in 1634 he swiftly found his place among them in the church they had convened two years previously. One of the many emigrant ministers who emerged from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he was a close fellow-worker among the leading lights of the \\"Bible Commonwealth\\". Having helped to formulate the laws by which the civil and ecclesiastical polity of the Colony were interwoven, throughout his long ministry he strongly upheld the conservative Puritan orthodoxy of his own Church, and of the Congregational collective, against doctrinal threat or dissent. Even in his passage to America he was confronted with the Antinomianism of Anne Hutchinson, and having urged and participated in the proceedings against her party which led to their banishment, he played an active part in the many unfolding controversies against the Baptists, the Quakers, and other subversive tendencies. With Massachusetts Baptists in particular he had a long struggle as their leading protagonists during the 1640s and 1650s were members of his own church.'Zechariah Symmes, 1634-1671', in W.B.

Vinton, The Symmes Memorial: A Biographical Sketch of Rev. Zechariah Symmes (David Clapp & Son, Boston 1873) (Internet Archive). Origins William Symmes, the father of Zechariah, matriculated from Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1577, and took B.A. in 1580/81 and M.A. in 1584. Becoming a Fellow of the college, he was ordained deacon and priest by the Bishop of Peterborough (Richard Howland) on 5 March 1586/87, and received the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1591.'Symmes or Sym, William', in J. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses Part I volume 4 (Cambridge University Press, 1927), p. 76 (Internet Archive). Clergy of the Church of England database, 'Syme, William', CCEd Person ID: 148989. Soon after ordination, around 1588 he preached at St Mary's church, Sandwich, in Kent, where Revd. Thomas PawsonSee under 'Pausson, Henry', in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part I volume 3 (Cambridge University Press 1924), p. 321 (Internet Archive). (who had been ordained by Matthew Parker in 1560) held the vicarage jointly with that of Ham in Kent (both Crown presentations) from 1564 until his death in 1597.Church of England Clergy database, 'Pawson, Thomas (1560-1597)', CCEd Person ID: 73309. Pawson, who had known Symmes and his parents in his schooldays, informed him that his father (also William Symmes) and mother had been protestant in the time of Queen Mary, and gave to the younger William a book of evangelical sermons which had belonged to the elder William and had been hidden in the Symmes house to avoid persecution. In December 1602 William junior recorded this information on the flyleaf of the book, and added the following remark: > \\"I charge my sons Zachariah and William, before Him that shall judge the > quick and the dead, that you never defile yourselves with any idolatry or > superstition whatsoever, but learn your religion out of God's holy word, and > worship God as he himself hath prescribed, and not after the devices and > traditions of men.\\"C.

St Peter's Church, Dunstable Born at Canterbury on 5 April 1599, Zechariah was religious from childhood. He was apparently the elder brother: he and William both attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Zechariah went first, admitted pensioner 1617, taking B.A. in 1620/21 and M.A. in 1624, and his brother followed, matriculating in 1619, taking B.A. in 1622/23 and M.A. in 1626. Zechariah is said to have been a particularly close friend of Jeremiah Burroughs.Mather, Magnalia, I, pp. 415-16. After working as children's tutor in various wealthy households,Mather, Magnalia, I, p. 415. he became lecturer at St Antholin, Budge Row in London in 1621 and in the following year married Sarah Baker at St Saviour's, Southwark. A son (c. 1623), and a daughter Sarah (c. 1625) were born to them in London.Vinton, The Symmes Memorial, pp. 1-17, at p. 16 (Internet Archive). However, as a dissenter he suffered persecution in the Bishops' Courts and resigned this position in 1625, being presented instead as Rector of Dunstable, Bedfordshire in that year, where he remained until 1634. There his children William (1626), Marie (1628), Elizabeth (1629), Huldah (1630), Hannah (1632) and Rebekah (February 1633/34) were baptized.J. Savage, Gleanings for New England History (Separate printing, 1843), at pp. 65-66 (Internet Archive): Issued also in Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society Series 3 volume 8, pp. [243]-348. Upon graduation and ordination his brother William received the Crown presentation of Harlington in Bedfordshire (not far from Dunstable) in 1627, where he at once married Mary Crawley on 17 May, and remained the Rector of Harlington until 1638.'Symmes, Zechariah' and 'Simmes, William', in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part 1 volume 4, p. 76 (Internet Archive). Emigration Whether for reasons of continuing persecution, or for the insufficiency of the living of Dunstable, Symmes followed the call of Divine providence to New England with his family in 1634. He sailed in the Griffin (which in the previous year had carried John Cotton to the same destination), arriving in Boston on 18 September. Among his fellow-travellers were the Revd. John Lothropp (who became pastor at Scituate and later at Barnstable, Plymouth Colony) together with some 30 of his congregation from the original English Independent Church in Southwark.Vinton, The Symmes Memorial, p. 3 (Internet Archive).'First Independent Church in England', in W. Wilson, The History and Antiquities of Dissenting Churches and Meeting Houses, in London, Westminster, and Southwark, 4 Vols. (Author, London 1808), I, pp. 36-50, at pp. 40-41 (Google). During the passage Symmes and Lothropp conducted religious meetings in the great cabin of the ship, where Symmes formed an unfavourable opinion of Anne Hutchinson, also a passenger, in whom (according to his later testimony) he perceived a secret opposition to the content of their ministry. They were (she thought) preaching a Covenant of Works, where Anne contended for a Covenant of Grace. Symmes, who in England had once or twice heard her slight the ministers of the Word, found her opinions corrupt and narrow in a discussion concerning a passage in St John, \\"that place in John concerning the love of the brethren\\",I.e., the First Epistle of John. Anne was affirming that those who love Christ will love one another. and she challenged him and said that \\"when they came to Boston there would be something more seen\\" than he had said, and that she had many things to say, but he \\"could not bear them now\\". On arrival at Boston he reported her for her views, and was called in to discuss the point at issue when she applied for admission to the church.Hutchinson, The History of the Province of Massachusetts-Bay (Thomas and John Fleet, Cornhill, Boston, 1767), Appendix II: 'November 1637, The Examination of Mrs Anne Hutchinson at the Court in Newtown', pp. 482-520, at p. 493 (Internet Archive).See also D.D. Hall (ed.), The Antinomian Controversy, 1636-1638: A Documentary History, pp. 322-23 (Google). Soon after his arrival Symmes was invited to assist in founding a church in a new place, but not wishing to distance himself from other ministers preferred to join a settled church, and, having been admitted to the church at Charlestown on 6 December, on 22 December 1634 he was granted the office of Teaching Elder, where Thomas James was pastor.W.F. Poole (ed.), Wonder-Working Providence of Sions Saviour in New England, by Captain Edward Johnson (Warren F. Draper, Andover 1867), Chapter XXXII, p. 70 (Internet Archive). (Original: Nathaniel Brooke, London 1654). James Cudworth, who had settled shortly before this in Scituate, referred to the arrival of his \\"cosson\\" Symmes there in a letter to his stepfather Dr. John Stoughton, active in the promotion of the emigrant ministry.'Letter of James Cudworth of Scituate, 1634', (to Dr. Stoughton), in New England Historical and Genealogical Register 14 (1860), pp. 101-04; see also J.C.

Sainsbury (ed.), Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574-1660 (Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts, London 1860), p. 194, no. 39 (Internet Archive).

John Stoughton had been a senior Fellow at Emmanuel College while the Symmes brothers were studying there.Alumni Cantabrigienses Part I Vol. 4, p. 171 (Internet Archive). Edward Johnson remarked that Mrs Sarah Symmes, 'indued by Christ with graces fit for a Wildernesse condition, her courage exceeding her stature, with much cheerfulnesse did undergoe all the difficulties of these times of straites, her God through Faith in Christ supplying all her wants with great industry, nurturing up her young children in the feare of the Lord'.Wonder-Working Providence, p. 70. Her children baptized in Charlestown were Ruth (1635), Zechariah (1637/38), Timothy (1640, died 1641), Deborah (1642) and Timothy (1643).The Symmes Memorial, pp. 16-17. Pastor of Charlestown: first years ;Thomas James Until 1632 the congregations of Boston and Charlestown were united under their pastor John Wilson, who was joined by John Cotton in 1633. The arrival of Thomas James (who had studied at Emmanuel College between 1611 and 1617, and after ordination had for some years ministered in the Lincoln dioceseVenn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, Part I vol. 2 (Cambridge University Press 1922), p. 462 (Internet Archive).) provided the opportunity for Charlestown to have a separate church: its members were detached from Boston in October 1632, and its covenant formed, with Revd. James its elected pastor, in November.W.I. Budington, The History of the First Church, Charlestown: In Nine Lectures, with Notes (Charles Tappan, Boston 1845), pp. 20-21 (Internet Archive). The coming of Zechariah Symmes as his preacher highlighted differences. \\"The teacher, Mr Symmes, and most of the brethren had taken offence at divers speeches of his,\\" [i.e. Mr. James's] \\"he being a melancholy man, and full of causeless jealousies, etc., for which they had dealt with him both in publick and in private.\\"J.K. Hosmer (ed.), Winthrop's Journal \\"History of New England\\" 1630-1649 Vol. I (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1909), p. 121 (Internet Archive). \\"Dealt with\\" here means \\"debated with\\". Many of his congregation, led by Increase Nowell, ruling elder, considered reuniting with Boston. Receiving no satisfaction, they sought advice from neighbouring churches, and after some formal meetings Revd. James obtained a dismission in March 1636 and removed to New Haven, Connecticut.W. Hubbard, A General History of New England, From the Discovery to MDCLXXX, 2nd Edition (Charles C. Little & James Brown, Boston 1848), pp. 190-91 (Internet Archive). Winthrop, Journal, I, p. 176 (Internet Archive). Symmes was then installed as pastor, an office he was to exercise for the next 35 years. ;Antinomians Symmes was without a formal assistant as preacher at Charlestown during the controversies of 1636-1637, which developed through the differences between John Wilson and John Cotton in Boston over the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, and the objections (raised by Thomas Shepard, pastor of Newtown (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and others of the wider ministry) against aspects of Cotton's teaching of \\"free grace\\", from which the Antinomians had drawn considerable strength.J.F. Cooper, Jr., 'Anne Hutchinson and the \\"Lay Rebellion\\" against the Clergy', The New England Quarterly Vol. 61, No. 3 (Sep. 1988), pp. 381-397 (JStor - Login). The rise in the followings of Anne Hutchinson and her marital kinsman John Wheelwright posed a great threat to the foundational values of the Colony plantation. This was the context for the condemnation of their opinions at the Assembly of the Churches at Newtown (Cambridge), on 30 August 1637,J. Winthrop, A Short Story of the Rise, Reign, and Ruin of the Antinomians, Familists, and Libertines that Infected the Churches of New- England (Thomas Parkhurst, London 1692). Full text at Umich/eebo. (open) and the subsequent hearings and trials by which they were driven from the Colony.Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, I, pp. 309-30 (Hathi Trust). John Cotton was brought into conference with the Assembly to disentangle the teachings which had led many (including Governor Vane) to oppose John Wilson, and at its close in late September 1637 John Davenport, newly arrived from England, was invited to preach.Budington, History of the First Church, Charlestown, pp. 42-44 (Internet Archive). At the examination of Anne Hutchinson at Newtown in November 1637, Symmes's questions and testimony carried significant weight.T. Hutchinson, The History of the Province of Massachusetts-Bay (Thomas and John Fleet, Cornhill, Boston, 1767), Appendix II: 'November 1637, The Examination of Mrs Anne Hutchinson at the Court in Newtown', pp. 482-520 (Internet Archive). At her first church trial Symmes showed his impatience with her sympathizers, remarking: \\"I am much grieved that so many in the congregation should stand up and declare themselves unwilling that Mrs Hutchinson should be proceeded against for such errors.\\" For this John Davenport reproved him, reminding him that the congregation must be persuaded of the rightness of their proceedings.J.F.

At interviews leading to this, and to her second church trial in Boston in March 1638, Symmes pressed hard to carry the judgement against her.L.

He assisted Symmes as preacher for a time, and the strong affection of his preaching is noted by Edward Johnson,Wonder-Working Providence, pp. 133-34. though there is no record of his ordination. In April 1638 he, together with Increase Nowell, Zechariah Symmes and three others, were chosen by the townspeople to formulate a preliminary body of laws for the town, in response to the invitation of the General Court to draft \\"such necessary and fundamentall lawes as may bee sutable\\".S.E. Morison, The Founding of Harvard College (Harvard University Press 1995), pp. 210-27, at p. 218 (Google); Budington, History of the First Church, Charleston, pp. 44-45 (Internet Archive). However on 14 September 1638 Harvard died of consumption, and gained his worldly immortality by leaving nearly ¬£780, half his estate, together with his valuable library, towards the foundation of the College or School at Cambridge, Massachusetts which bears his name, for training young men for the ministry. Although accounts of the foundation emphasize the role of Thomas Shepard, who had advocated the project since 1636,'John Harvard (1607-1638)', Emmanuel College webpage. C.E. Wright, 'Harvard, John (1607‚Äì1638), educational benefactor', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). for many years Symmes was an Overseer of the College, which arose only a short distance from Charlestown, and his son Zechariah was among its early graduates and Fellows.Morison, The Founding of Harvard College, pp. 328, 402; J.L. Sibley, Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Volume 1: 1642-58 (Charles William Sever, Cambridge Mass. 1875), Johnson reprint, I, p. 489 ff (Google). ;Appointment of Thomas Allen, 1639 The vacancy left by Harvard's death was supplied by Thomas Allen, a graduate of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, ordained in March 1633/34, who had a ministry in his home city of Norwich until silenced by Bishop Wren in 1636 for nonconformism.Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses Part I vol. 1 (Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 19 (Internet Archive]. Having arrived at Boston in 1638, he married John Harvard's widow and became administrator of his will. At first admitted to the Boston church, with the support of the Charlestown congregation he obtained dismissal from it in June 1639. The General Court had granted him 500 acres in Charlestown in the May preceding, and he was received into the Charlestown church in the December following.R. Frothingham, The History of Charlestown, Massachusetts (Charles C. Little & James Brown, Boston 1845), p. 75, note 4 and p. 130 ff (Internet Archive). Then or soon afterwards he became its Teacher, and remained co-worker with Symmes until he returned to England in 1651. At about this time Symmes contributed his Letter of Dedication (to Lady Anna Wake, widow of Sir Isaac Wake) to the publication of Thomas Hooker's The Christians Two Chiefe Lessons, viz. Selfe-Deniall, and Selfe-Tryall, published in 1640.The Christians two chiefe lessons viz. selfe-deniall, and selfe-tryall. As also the priviledge of adoption and triall thereof.

Foundation of Woburn The foundation territory of Charlestown was apportioned to its townsmen and investors, and as outlying settlements developed administrative authority was ceded to them, defining fresh boundaries.Frothingham, The History of Charlestown, pp. 49-66 (Internet Archive). The township stood on the Neck or peninsula fronting inner Boston Harbor between the Charles River to the south and the Mystic River descending from the north-west. Its leading citizens had farm estates extending through \\"Mistick field\\" along the Mystic River valley, and in the difficult first years a large estate on the north-east side at Medford was staked out for Mathew Cradock, first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company; formally granted in 1634, this private domain became a Peculiar managed on his behalf by his representatives.C. Seaburg and A. Seaburg, Medford on the Mystic (Medford Historical Society, 1980). C. Brooks, The History of the Town of Medford (James M. Usher, Boston 1855), pp. 31-45 and pp. 78-93 (Internet Archive). The town of Charleston granted 300 acres to Zechariah Symmes, the abutters of which are noted in records of 1638.W.H. Whitmore, Charlestown Land Records, 3rd Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston (Rockwell & Churchill, Boston 1878), pp. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 18, 29, 32, 36, 39, 40, 43, 47, 49, 57, 64, 66. Some 280 acres lay in a body in the area of Winchester either side of the river, with Mystic Pond at its south-west and the Woburn area to its north-west: the old farmstead was in the north of the estate, near the river. He also held some 11 acres of meadow in the southern part of Stoneham and some 9 acres of salt-marsh at Menotomy (in what is now Arlington).Vinton, The Symmes Memorial, pp. 11-12, 15, pp. 22-23 (Internet Archive). On 13‚Äì15 May 1640 Charlestown petitioned for the addition of two miles square to its territory at its western border, to accommodate farms for new townsmen who might be admitted. This being granted by the General Court, Increase Nowell, Zechariah Symmes, Edward Convers, Edward Johnson and others, whose own lands lay towards that quarter, went at once to explore it. After a further visit in September to observe its boundary with Lynn (later Reading), on 7 October the grant was increased to four square miles, with a view to settling a village there. On 5 November a committee was appointed by the town to draw a boundary between the proposed village and the town, but immediately the Charleston church appointed its own commissioners to develop a new distinct township there with its own church. The idea gained so much favour that the church hesitated, fearing too large a departure: but in February the Convers Bridge was built, and a site was chosen for the town, from which however the intending settlers were dissuaded by Nowell and Symmes as being unsuitable, and another was decided upon. As the town was a-building, a pastor was sought, and after two disappointments hopes were renewed in Thomas Carter (of Hinderclay, a graduate of St John's College, CambridgeVenn, Alumni Cantabrigienses Part I vol. 1, p. 301 (Internet Archive).) now an Elder at Watertown, Massachusetts.S. Sewall, The History of Woburn, Middlesex County, Mass. (Wiggin and Lunt, Boston 1868), pp. 8-18, with sources there cited (Internet Archive). The First Burial Ground at Woburn, Massachusetts The commissioners obtained leave to have public worship at the village, and Symmes preached the first sermon at the village on 21 November 1641 (\\"Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns\\" - Jeremiah IV v. 3): Carter preached on 5 December. Over the next months he continued to encourage them. The settlers obtained dismissal from Charlestown in June 1642, and in August the Woburn congregation was solemnly gathered in the presence of the leading ministers of Massachusetts. Zechariah Symmes continued between four and five hours in praying and preaching, after which the elders made their formal declarations and covenant to welcome the new church. The town of Woburn was incorporated at the end of September 1642. Thomas Carter was ordained their pastor in November, in the presence of the same assembled ministers, by the laying on of hands by two laymen: since the church had no elders of its own, other elders present might have performed it, but they chose to avoid any suggestion of a presbytery or dependency of churches.Sewall, The History of Woburn, pp. 18-23 (Internet Archive). Wonder-Working Providence, pp. xcii-xcvi and pp. 175-81 (Internet Archive). Carter was pastor until his death in 1684. Certain \\"remote lands\\" mentioned in the 1640 petition, commonly called \\"The Land of Nod\\", lay to the north of Woburn, and although all was laid under the municipal authority of the new town, the more remote part of this tract was granted to Charlestown proprietors. Of these lands Zechariah Symmes and Thomas Allen were each allotted 300 acres in 1643, though they were not laid out until 1650. Meanwhile, a town boundary dispute arose between Charlestown and Woburn, which in 1650/51 was settled to lie along the property boundaries of the farms of Increase Nowell, Zechariah Symmes and Edward Convers.Frothingham, The History of Charlestown, pp. 110-12 (Google). Unfolding controversies Within the puritan ministry central to the religious plantation of the Bay Colony, Symmes and Allen in 1648 held annual salaries of ¬£90 and ¬£60, matched only by John Cotton and John Wilson at Boston in their respective roles, well in advance of other colleagues.Good News from New-England: with an exact account of the first plantation of that country (Printed by Matthew Simmons, London 1648), reprinted in Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, 4th Series volume I (Boston 1852), pp. 195-218, at pp. 211-14 (Internet Archive).

(during which the Charlestown church records are very imperfect), they faced continuing challenges both from the Old England ministry and from advocates of liberty of conscience not to be tolerated. ;Samuel Gorton The Colony's incursion into Shawomet in the Narragansett lands south of Pawtuxet for the capture of Samuel Gorton and his associates, led to Gorton himself being imprisoned in Charlestown; there, in 1643, having narrowly avoided a death sentence, Gorton was put to labour in chains, yet contrived to demand of his captors and their ministers an exposition of the locusts of the Fifth trumpet of the Book of Revelation.S.

If Christ's suffering had purchased the redemption of mankind from its inherent sin (he argued), it was not also a punishment upon Him (penal substitution) incurred by God's anger against the sins of mankind. Faced with this inflammatory heresy, a Boston court in session seized the whole print-run as it arrived, sent an immediate letter of denunciation to England, and set proceedings against Pynchon in motion.

Both as Overseer and parent Symmes had a personal interest: his son Zechariah junr. was a student at the college from April 1653 to October 1656.Sibley, Biographical Sketches of Graduates, p. 489 (Google). Dunster was subjected to a civil prosecution and tendered his resignation in October 1654.Chaplin, Life of Henry Dunster, pp. 124-36 (Internet Archive). What was admired of Symmes was expressed in 1654 in verse by Edward Johnson: > \\"Come Zachary, thou must re-edifie > Christ['s] Churches in this desart Land of his: > With Moses' zeale, stampt unto dust, defie > All crooked wayes that Christ['s] true worship misse; > With spirit's sword and armor girt about > Thou lay'st on load, proud Prelate's Crown to crack, > And wilt not suffer Wolfes thy flock to rout, > Though close they creepe, with sheepe skins on their back...\\"Johnson, > Wonder-Working Providence, p. 71 (Internet Archive).

It was therefore under Dunster's successor Charles Chauncy that the Elders of the Churches of Christ in New England (including Symmes) made their petition to Lord Protector Cromwell, that he should enlarge his \\"pious and princely heart and hand to the affording of more settled and comfortable subsisting and maintenance to our English College in Cambridge\\". They remarked that the Lord had set up his Highness, \\"Hezekiah-like\\", to be \\"a second founder (as it were) of the Universities and Schooles of Learning\\"; they feared, \\"least that vision should faile from amongst us by reason of the continuall wasting of the old stock of the Seers and Ministers of Christ in these partes, having no hopes of other supplyes, besides what is raysed out of one Colledge at Cambridge amongst us\\" (that one college being in a poor and mean condition, and its maintenance too great a burden for the people of the country to bear); \\"and lastly, because the education of the Indian youth in Piety and Learning, in our Indian Colledge, erected and annexed to our English Colledge, doth depend much upon the welfare, comfortable support, and instruction of the English\\".J.

Backus, A History of New England, with Particular Reference to the Denomination of Christians Called Baptists, 2 vols (Edward Draper, for Phillip Freeman, Boston 1777), I, pp. 355-415 (Internet Archive). Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, p. 151 no. 30 (Hathi Trust). His account spans the whole period until 1665, throughout which Symmes led the denunciation against him, resulting at last in Gould's excommunication, his imprisonment and his gathering of the first Baptist Church in Charlestown.Gould's Narrative in Backus, History of New England, I, pp. 359-71 (Internet Archive). Gould having withheld his child from baptism, at a deferred church meeting to which he was summoned Symmes accused him of lying, and sought to proceed against him, but the accusation was disproved. At a meeting arranged for Gould to present his views, Symmes arrived with a written list of points in Scripture for Gould to answer, but this procedure was not in order: further, when Gould completed a sentence quoted by Symmes, Symmes angrily but mistakenly accused him of blasphemy, until others corrected him. However Symmes at first tried to keep Gould's affair out of court, and sought (unsuccessfully) to induce him to withdraw to avoid the admonitionAdmonition was a formal step in Church discipline which opened the way to Excommunication. See 'Chapter V: The fourth Instruction', in R. Resbury, The Tabernacle of God with Men, or, The Visible Church Reformed (London 1649), pp. 71 ff (Google). which was next delivered against him by Elder Green.Backus, History of New England, I, pp. 359-66. Thus excluded by conscience from the communion, Gould thereafter attended meetings in Cambridge, and in June 1658 received a second admonition from Symmes directly (Elder Green having died), on the grounds of schism by departing from the covenant.Budington, The History of the First Church, Charlestown, pp. 56-59 (Internet Archive). ;Quakers The Ecclesiastical Assembly at Boston of June 1657, to which Symmes was called,'The Half Way Covenant Decisions of 1657 and 1662', in W. Walker, The Creeds and Platforms of Congregationalism (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1893), pp. 238-339, at p. 258 and pp. 288-300 (Internet Archive). addressed issues of the baptism and admission of children, but left an uneasy laxity (Sect. 10) concerning the Half-Way Covenant for the children of children covenanted in the name of their parents.Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 153-59 (Hathi Trust). Hubbard, A General History of New England, pp. 562-71 (Internet Archive). Meanwhile, confronted by the arrival of several Quakers who were duly arrested and returned to England, in October 1656 the Bay legislature had enacted a severe law of exclusion against that \\"cursed sect of hereticks\\".Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 148-49 (Hathi Trust) These people followed a call to encourage and minister to Friends and sympathizers throughout New England, and found their way back into the Bay Colony through Providence or Barbados. During July and August 1657 Christopher Holder and his companion John Copeland carried their mission successfully through several townships, including Charlestown, until arrested in Salem, where they were imprisoned and whipped, and after further infractions had their right ears cut off.C.F. Holder, The Holders of Holderness. A History and Genealogy of the Holder Family with especial reference to Christopher Holder (Author, California (1902)), pp. 20-148 (Internet Archive). Their persistence despite repeated punishments inflamed the hostility of John Endicott, and cruel and cumulative penalties were meted out to all who succoured them. The puritan legislature issued a demand to the Assembly of Rhode Island that measures be taken to prevent Quaker incursions into the United Colonies of the New England Confederation, which was stoutly rejected.T.W. Bicknell, The History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Vol. III (The American Historical Society, Inc., New York 1920), pp. 1024-25. (Hathi Trust) Symmes's cousin James Cudworth of Scituate (who alone as a Commissioner had refused to sign this letterFelt, Ecclesiastical History, II, p. 170 (Hathi Trust).) was soon deemed to be a favourer of Quakers and was deprived of his military command and magistracy. In a letter to England of December 1658 he exposed this persecuting spirit of intolerance,R.P. Hallowell, The Quaker Invasion of Massachusetts (Houghton, Mifflin & Co, Boston/Riverside Press, Cambridge 1883), pp. 162-172 (Internet Archive). and in 1660 was disfranchised of his freedom of Plymouth Colony as a subversive.Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 243-44 (Hathi Trust). Driven to make an example, Endicott in 1659 presided over the condemnation of William Robinson and Marmaduke Stephenson, and of Mary Dyer. During their trial and imprisonment awaiting execution, Zechariah Symmes and John Norton (who drew up articles of refutation) were deputed to attend Robinson and Stephenson \\"with religious conversation fitted for their condition\\",Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 212-17, at p. 212 (Hathi Trust). but it was John Wilson who shouted his denunciations at them in their march to the Boston scaffold.J. Besse, A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers, from 1650 to 1689 (Luke Hinde, London 1753), Vol. 2, pp. 198-205 (Google). The Boston court, in self-justification, called them \\"felons de se\\" for their persistent breach of a known law.Hubbard, A General History of New England, pp. 571-74 (Internet Archive). Later ministry ;Thomas Shepard, junr. A letter of February 1657/58 from Ezekiel Rogers, pastor at Rowley, Massachusetts, lamenting the state of the world, expresses his affection for Symmes.Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana, I, pp. 372-73 (Google). T. Gage, The History of Rowley (Ferdinand Andrews, Boston 1840), pp. 57-58 (Google). The long absence of a Teacher at Charlestown was supplied in 1659 by Thomas Shepard (1635-1677), son of the lamented pastor of Cambridge. Shepard emerged from Harvard College in the class of 1653 and was chosen a Fellow in 1654, while the younger Zechariah Symmes was studying there.Sibley, Biographical Sketches of Graduates, pp. 327-335 and p. 489 (Google). In the absence of an Elder, the Platform now provided for ordination by elders of other churches, if at the express desire of the church ordaining: having been admitted to Charlestown on 31 October 1658 by dismissal from Cambridge, he was accordingly ordained (with prayer and fasting) to the office of Teacher at Charlestown by the imposition of hands of Symmes, and of pastors John Wilson (Boston) and Richard Mather (Dorchester). John Norton (Teacher, Boston) gave him the right hand of fellowship in the name of Boston, Roxbury, Cambridge and Watertown, as Symmes carefully recorded:S. Sewell, 'Appendix to Brief Survey of Congregational Churches and Ministers in the County of Middlesex', in B.B. Edwards and W. Cogswell (eds), The American Quarterly Register Volume XII (February 1840), pp 234-53, at p. 244. Shepard, who like Symmes was conservative in doctrine, remained with him thereafter, and the Charlestown church records are then mainly in his hand.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, pp. 161-62 (Internet Archive). ;John Dury's Letter The Restoration of the English monarchy transformed the position of New England towards the sovereign authority. In 1660 John Dury, whose great project was to pacify differences between protestant denominations, wrote to the New England ministers, for whom John Norton composed the (Latin) reply.S. Mather, An apology for the liberties of the churches in New England: to which is prefix'd, a discourse concerning congregational churches (T. Fleet, for Daniel Henchman, over-against the Brick Meeting House in Cornhill, Boston 1738), pp. 151-66. Full text at Evans/tcp. Symmes and his son (as Fellow of Harvard) were among the signatories. Commending his courage in so superhuman a cause,They thought it impossible: \\"Which Task, whosoever shall effect, if we may be Judges, will deserve a more than ordinary Triumphant Statue; and whose Monument will so far excel the Trophies of Achilles, as if they were not worthy to be mentioned in the same Day.\\" This is perhaps the only Puritan joke to have survived. they offered fellowship with any church which professed the Gospel, the fundamentals of doctrine and the essentials of order.See Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 228 (date), and 344-45 (Hathi Trust). Having executed William Leddra (for refusing to leave the Jurisdiction) in March 1661, and condemned others, their treatment of Quakers was catalogued by George Bishop in 1661, who noted that their Charter did not empower them to make laws \\"repugnant to the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances of this Realm\\".G. Bishope, New England Judged, not by Man's, but the Spirit of the Lord: and the Summe Sealed up of New-England's Persecutions, being a brief relation of the sufferings of the people called Quakers in those parts of America from the beginning of the fifth moneth 1656 (the time of their first arrival at Boston from England) to the later end of the tenth moneth, 1660 (Robert Wilson, London 1661), p. 31.

There followed the royal Mandamus of 9 September 1661, addressed to Endicott and his ministers, against any corporal or capital sentence being carried out against Quakers: which, though it tempered the puritans' severity, did not weaken their purpose.Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, pp. 281-88 (Hathi Trust). ;Boston Synod of 1662 Governor Endicott's court having appointed John Norton and Simon Bradstreet to present its address to the King in London and to negotiate the continued rights and privileges of the Colony,Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, p. 288-90 (Hathi Trust). at the Boston Synod convened in March 1662 Zechariah Symmes was a senior figure among more than 70 clergy present. The agenda turned principally upon who were fit subjects for baptism, and on the consociation of churches.Walker, Creeds and Platforms of Congregationalism, p. 263-66 (Internet Archive). The June/July session, passing over objections to Congregationalism forwarded by Thomas Parker,Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, p. 293. prepared itself to accommodate what changes would be demanded of them. The King's declaration, issued 28 June (shortly after the beheading of Sir Henry Vane the Younger), upheld the Bay Colony's Charter, but in freedom of conscience, requiring no disadvantage for observation of the established Prayer Book, and admission for all leading upright lives to The Lord's Supper, and their children to baptism, though supporting sharp laws against the ungovernable Quakers.E. Hazard, Historical Collections: Consisting of State Papers, and Other Authentic Documents, 2 vols (1792-94), II, pp. 605-07 (Google). In England the Act of Uniformity (1662) came into force in August, and many non-subscribing ministers were ejected. Accordingly in September the Halfway Covenant was re-formulated: in October the King's letter was brought into the Massachusetts Court, and Wilson, Mather, Symmes and John Allin entered with the Result of the Synod,Walker, Creeds and Platforms of Congregationalism, pp. 265-70, and pp. 301-39 (Internet Archive); Felt, Ecclesiastical History II, 293-96, 299.Propositions concerning the subject of baptism and consociation of churches, collected and confirmed out of the word of God, by a synod of elders and messengers of the churches in Massachusetts- Colony in New England.

Burg, Richard Mather of Dorchester (University Press of Kentucky, 2015), p. 152 (Google). ;The Baptists In 1663 Zechariah Symmes junior was preaching in Rehoboth, Plymouth Colony, and sharing duties with John Myles,Felt, Ecclesiastical History, II, p. 387. who in that year departed to found the First Baptist Church in Swansea. In the Bay Colony the Halfway Covenant, though fiercely opposed by John Davenport and others, made firm ground on which to oppose the Baptists, whose recalcitrant luminaries were particularly concentrated in Charlestown.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, pp. 162-173 (Internet Archive). Thomas Gould, deprived of the ordinances of the church but not yet formally excommunicated, was joined by friends from England and, supported by sympathizers, held private meetings.'Discipline of Thomas Goold' and 'Thomas Goold's own Narrative', in N.E. Wood, The History of the First Baptist Church of Boston (1665-1899) (American Baptist Publication Society, Philadelphia 1899), pp. 37-51 (Internet Archive). Gould and Thomas Osborne were called out: in a notable confrontation, Symmes senior questioned Gould's long absence and urged his excommunication. Gould maintained he was no schismatic, but had been excluded because he would not disavow his objection to infant baptism (i.e. to the doctrine of the heritable Elect Seed of righteousness) to gain readmittance, and remained upright in life and worship. When he suggested the arbitration of other ministers, Symmes asserted the authority of his own church to deal with him: but members of the congregation came to Gould's defence. Symmes moderated his demand to a further admonition, but this also was spoken against, and the meeting ended in confusion when it was found that Symmes's second admonition of Gould (of 1658) had not been in order and was unknown to the congregation.'Thomas Goold's own Narrative'. His perceived hostility towards Gould was draining his support from his own church.A.L. Sweet, 'The Development of Local Religious Tolerance in Massachusetts Bay Colony', Master's Thesis, University of Massachusetts Amherst 1991, (ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst pdf, pp. 35-48), at p. 41 (pdf p. 47). Further admonitions in early 1664 failed to prevent Gould's continued meetings, and in May 1665 he and eight others formed a church, re-baptized, and signed articles, so instituting the First Baptist Church in Boston.Wood, First Baptist Church of Boston, pp. 55-64 (Internet Archive). The Charlestown church proceeded to excommunication in late June or July 1665, and in September‚ÄìOctober Gould, Osborne and three others, having presented a confession of faith,Wood, First Baptist Church of Boston, pp. 64-71 (Internet Archive). came before the General Court and were condemned as schismatics and disfranchised of their freedom of the Colony, under threat of immediate imprisonment. But they continued to meet until April 1666, when being called before the grand jury at Suffolk County Quarterly Court they refused to pay fines and were imprisoned. In March 1668 Gould appealed to the Court of Assistants and the Suffolk County judgement was overturned, but then reinstated.Backus, History of the Baptists, I, pp. 371-80 (Internet Archive). Governor Bellingham then agreed to sponsor the Boston Debate of 14‚Äì15 April 1668, ostensibly to deliberate on their views, but (as the transcript reveals) intending to defeat or incriminate them.W.G. McLoughlin and M.W. Davidson, 'The Baptist Debate of April 14‚Äì15, 1668', Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society 3rd Series, Vol. 76 (1964), pp. 91-133 (Jstor - Login). Jonathan Mitchel (Moderating) and Thomas Shepard challenged them at length: Symmes was present, but spoke only to say he thought Gould was very sinful. Gould and another were again imprisoned, and (despite a scandalous petition to free themBackus, History of the Baptists, pp. 380-82, & ff. (Internet Archive).) remained so until March 1669: being granted a brief release, they escaped to Noddle's Island, where they continued unmolested. Death and legacy In 1667 John Wilson died, and in 1669 Richard Mather followed him to their eternal reward. The church of Charleston sought to relieve Symmes of his labours, and approached John Oxenbridge for the ministry, who had often preached to them, but he succeeded Wilson at Boston.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, pp. 174-75 (Internet Archive). Zechariah Symmes died on 4 February 1671. He had dated his will on 20 January 1664/65. He left to his widow the use of all his worldly estate while she remained unmarried, and then to be divided among his children, having already provided portions for his daughters. Particular reference is made to his library (valued at ¬£85.10s.03d.), which was left to Zechariah junr., including all his written books (manuscripts and notes of sermons), none of which he had ever prepared or intended for print, but which were in bound volumes, and which he asked might be loaned among his children at their desire. His lands, including the Charlestown dwelling-house, the farm near Woburn with land at Menotomy, the 300 acres in the Land of Nod, and several other parcels, were together valued at ¬£460. His furniture and moveables (including library) were worth ¬£681. He included a legacy of ¬£5 to his brother William, \\"a small remembrance of his very great love and costs to us and ours\\". The will was proved 31 March 1672.Vinton, The Symmes Memorial, pp. 12-15 (Internet Archive). On 6 November 1672 the town voted that he should have a stone tomb, to be commissioned from \\"the stone cutter at Boston\\", for which the order was issued in February 1673.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, p. 175 (Internet Archive). It bore an epitaph which is no longer legible, but which was observed by Cotton Mather, who recorded the lines: > \\"A prophet lies under this stone: > His words shall live, though he be gone.\\" He adds that it ought to have said, \\"Here lies the friend of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs\\", for he has the letters Burroughs sent to Symmes on his coming to New England, in which Burroughs compares their love to that of David and Jonathan, as a sort of sworn brotherhood from their University days.Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana, 2nd edition, I,pp. 415-16 (Google). Thomas Shepard succeeded fully to his ministry at Charlestown, and the meeting-house was largely refurbished soon afterwards.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, p. 186 (Internet Archive). The pastor-poet Edward Taylor wrote an Elegy upon his death.W.B. Sprague, Annals of the American Pulpit (Robert Carter and Brothers, New York 1857), p. 179 (Internet Archive). Sarah Symmes, with whom he had lived 49 years and 7 months, survived him, and her will was proved on 28 December 1676, to which their sons-in-law Thomas Savage and Edward Willis were executors.Vinton, The Symmes Memorial, p. 16 (Internet Archive). The deaths of Wilson, Mather and Symmes presaged the close of what has been called the \\"golden era of the Bible Commonwealth\\".McLoughlin and Davidson, 'The Boston Debate', at p. 94. As in Plymouth Colony the death of Thomas Prence ushered in more lenient times towards Quakers under Josiah Winslow, so Symmes's determined defence of his doctrines had played its part in shaping the future of the Baptist movement. His cousin James Cudworth, rehabilitated in his Plymouth military command, joined with Thomas Savage (whose first wife was Faith, daughter of Ann Hutchinson) leading the Massachusetts men, in their march to relieve Swansea in June 1675.G.M.

Early life Duntzfelt was born in Negapatnam, the son of Ingeneer Leutenant in the Dutch East India Company Johann Friedrich D√ºntzfeld (1725‚Äì85) and Anna Abigael Kr√∏ckel. Duntzfelt's father left his wife and son when Duntzfelt was just two years old. A relative, Ole Bie, took care of the boy and secured him a position as a reserve assistant in Tranquebar and in 1777 as an assistant in Frederiksnagore. Over the years he was promoted through the ranks, initially in the service of the Danish Asiatic Company and later in the local government. He had also interests in overseas trade between the Rast Indies and Europe as a partner in the firm Duntzfelt, Bloom og Kierulff. Career in Denmark William Duntzfelt Duntzfelt visited Denmark in 1788 and married the daughter of the wealthy merchant Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck on the Dronningg√•rd estate in July 1790. He briefly returned to Danish East India but settled permanently in Copenhagen from February 1791. He became a managing partner in the firm Pingel, Meyer, Pr√¶torius & Co. which had been initiated by his father-in-law in 1787 as a replacement for the Baltic African Company. Duntzfelt also established his own trading house that traded on Rast India. He was granted citizenship (borgerskab) as merchant (grosserer) in 1795 and, in 1796, Duntzfelt and de Coninck decided to dissolve the consortium and transfer the activities to their personal firms. He was also active as a banker and in the market for insurrances. Fran√ßois le Chevalier and Johannes S√∏b√∏tker joined his firm as partners in 1799 and 1804. At the turn of the century, Duntzfelt was the largest ship-owner in the Nordic countries. He had profited immensely from Denmark's neutrality but many of his ships were still captured by English and French privateers and subsequently confiscated by court order. Duntzfelt & Co.'s losses from British confiscations alone was estimated at ¬£144,660. He also suffered great losses during the war with England and the 1807 bombardment of Copenhagen. Duntzfelt was a member of the managing board of Speciebanken from 1796 and of Depositokassen from 1799. He was a member of Grosserersocietetet's governing body from 1802. Personal life Duntzfelt owned a house in Amaliegade in Copenhagen and later the Dehn Mansion in Norgesgade. He also owned the country house Ankersminde (later Ordruph√∏j) in Ordrup. He died during a visit to Paris in 1809. In spite of the great losses that he had suffered during the last decade of his career, he still died as one of the wealthiest merchants in the country. Duntzfelt's two sons, William Frederik Duntzfelt and Frederik Duntzfelt, joined Duntzfelt & Co. after their father's death. It was declared bankrupt in 1833.

It is a private company based in Buffalo, New York. Thiru Vikram is the CEO of the company.  History  Buffalo Automation was founded by Thiru Vikram, Alexander Zhitelzeyf and Emilie Reynolds, who were engineering students at the University at Buffalo. Originating as a university research project, the concept was transformed into a company in 2015. =AutoMate= The team developed AutoMate, a predictive system which uses artificial intelligence technology and neural networks to coordinate and integrate data, decisions, and actions based on nautical maps, cameras, sensors, thermal imaging, broadband radars, GPS, LiDAR and Automatic Identification System (AIS). The system allows autonomous identification and safe navigation around stationary objects (allision avoidance), swimmers, and other vessels within the surrounding . Initially developed as a fleet management and autopilot solution for the commercial shipping industry, the technology has since been adapted for use with recreational boats, including yachts and motorboats. Initial tests were performed in 2015, using a -long catamaran equipped with the AutoMate system. In addition to hazard identification and avoidance, the AutoMate system also employs neural networks to recognize navigation signs, help vessels maneuver in compliance with International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), and interpret weather conditions. The technology helps in fuel efficiency, which was tested in 2018 on vessels in the Great Lakes. In early 2018, Buffalo Automation began tests of a -long autonomous pleasure boat made by Sea Ray, a boat manufacturer owned by the Brunswick Boat Group. Also in 2018, Buffalo Automation expanded its sales focus to Europe. Trials of the United Kingdom's first robot water taxis, watercraft equipped with the AutoMate autonomous navigation system, are scheduled for summer 2020 in Plymouth (UK). =The Mayday= In 2020, Buffalo Automation introduced The Mayday (originally named Greycraft), a free app designed to encourage people to experiment with and experience artificial intelligence technology that is otherwise not readily accessible to the average person. Greycraft operates as a self-contained offline neural network capable of detecting boats, ships, and other vessels visible to a cell phone camera. =Bifrost= In 2020, Buffalo Automation redeveloped its thermal imaging software to enable rapid skin temperature scanning of multiple people in a crowd to detect fever, in response to a health care and public health sector unmet need created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Named Bifrost, the system operates as a Software as a service (SaaS) solution, where Buffalo Automation's convolutional neural network is combined with existing thermal imaging equipment in order to rapidly report the skin temperature of different facial regions of each individual in a crowd. The Bifrost Project was piloted at the entry to the University of Buffalo Neurosurgery Center of the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.  Funding  In 2016, Buffalo Automation secured US$25,000 in pre-seed investments from Launch NY and Z80 Labs. In 2018, it raised $900,000 in a seed funding round led by the Jacobs family office, with Z80 making a $100,000 follow-on investment. Grants from SUNY and New York State business plan competition prizes helped bootstrap early activity.  Awards and recognition  * In 2015, Buffalo Automation won the inaugural Buffalo Student Sandbox, an accelerator program. * In 2016, it won the University at Buffalo's Henry A. Panasci Jr. Technology Entrepreneurship Competition.

It has a triangular, sharply pointed leaf and a small translucent, greenish-white flower with purple markings and with very long sepals. It is found on both the main islands of New Zealand and also some of the off-shore islands.  Description  Corybas acuminatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single triangular to heart-shaped leaf up to long and wide with a sharply pointed tip. The leaf is light green on the upper surface and silvery with red veins on the lower side. A single more or less translucent flower with dull red striations arises directly above the leaf. The largest part of the flower is the dorsal sepal which is up to long with a long, horizontal, thread-like tip. The lateral sepals are erect, thread-like and are up to longer than the flower. The petals are similar to the lateral sepals although smaller and are held horizontally or turn downwards. The labellum is red and creamy green and has two rounded ear-like shapes near its base. Flowering occurs from August to December.  Taxonomy  Corybas acuminatus was first formally described in 1991 by Mark Clements and Edwin Hatch from a specimen collected near Karekare and the description was published in the New Zealand Journal of Botany. The specific epithet (acuminatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"pointed\\" or \\"sharpened\\", referring to the shape of the leaf of this orchid. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Nematoceras but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The dancing spider orchid grows in moist, shady forests. It occurs on the North, South, Stewart, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Conservation Corybas acuminatus is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation.

She received a BSc in biology from the University of Michigan, where she also learned to scuba dive. She studied marine biology at Hopkins Marine Station run by Stanford University in California. She received a MSc in marine biology from the University of Hawaii. She did not pursue a career in science, as women were not easily accepted, so instead went on to teach in science to 7th and 8th grade students in Gilroy, California, while pursuing the exploration of underwater photography. From 1969 to 1987, she was married to Jim Church, a pioneer in underwater photography. With him, she developed photography courses which were offered through the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS), but due to NASDS attaching their own copyright to the course, the Churches never updated or continued to pursue this product. Cathy co-wrote and published four books on underwater photography and contributed articles to various magazines. For fifteen years, she was co-photo editor for Skin Diver Magazine. She has done photography for various clients, including Kodak, Nikon, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. Church received a NOGI Award from the Academy of Underwater Arts and Science in 1985 and was the President of this esteemed organization two times. She was also awarded the Diving Equipment & Marketing Association's DEMA Reaching Out Award in 2000. She was named to the Women Divers Hall of Fame in 2000 and to the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in 2008. She started teaching underwater summer courses at Spanish Bay Reef Resort in Grand Cayman in 1972, and continued teaching summer classes for seven more years. She then devoted her full time to teaching at her photo centre \\"Cathy Church's Photo Centre\\" in Grand Cayman where she is still actively taking pictures and teaching underwater Photography.

The murders were committed by Huang after the family failed to repay gambling debts.  Background  = Eight Immortals Restaurant = The Eight Immortals Restaurant was a Chinese restaurant in the Portuguese colony of Macau. The modest eating establishment was connected to the Eight Immortals Hotel. The restaurant was owned and operated by Zheng Lin, a former street hawker who moved his business from a stand into a formal restaurant in the 1960s. He lived nearby his restaurant with his family, who helped him run his business. The restaurant was a financial success, but Zheng and his wife were noted to be heavy gamblers. = Huang Zhiheng = Huang Zhiheng (sometimes spelled Huang Chih-heng) was born on the Chinese mainland before emigrating to Hong Kong in the 1970s. Huang went by various names during his life, going by Chen Shuliang or Chen Yuliang when in Hong Kong. In 1973 he was involved in a dispute with another man who owed Huang money. The dispute resulted in Huang murdering the other man and fleeing Hong Kong for Guangzhou. After living in Guangzhou for several years, Huang married the daughter of his landlord. The woman's family disapproved of the marriage, so the couple eloped, fleeing to Macau. Before his second leaving of China, Huang burned off his fingertips to avoid being connected to the murder he committed in Hong Kong. In Macau Huang became involved in the local gambling scene, becoming acquainted with the Zhengs in the process. Huang was around 50 years old at the time. During one evening of gambling in 1984 Huang and Zheng Lin became involved in a series of high stakes bets against each other. In the end Huang won 180,000 yuan from Zheng and his wife. The Zhengs were unable to pay the debt, so a verbal agreement was made that the Zheng family would cede their restaurant's mortgage to Huang if the debt were not repaid within one year. Huang agreed. However, after one year the Zhengs had failed to repay their debt. Huang later claimed that, not only had the family failed to repay him, they had also continued to lose money to him. In total, he stated that they owed him 600,000 yuan.  Murders  The Eight Immortals murders took place on the night of 4 August 1985. Nine members of the Zheng family were busy inside the restaurant, having earlier closed the establishment for the evening. The Zhengs were last seen alive by a delivery truck driver late in the afternoon. In the evening an angry Huang entered the Eight Immortals Restaurant and demanded that the Zhengs pay him 30,000 yuan (he later claimed that he dropped his demand to 20,000 yuan) of the debt they owed him. He grew increasingly agitated when Zheng Lin refused to turn over ownership of the restaurant. Eventually Huang grew physically aggressive towards the Zhengs, breaking a beer bottle and using the jagged glass that remained as a weapon. He took Zheng Lin's son hostage and forced the other members of the family to bind and gag each other while holding his weapon to the son's neck. Huang later confessed that one family member broke free and started to scream, causing him to stab her in the neck with his weapon. He then proceeded to kill nine members of the Zheng family, either by strangulation or with the broken bottle. He then briefly left the restaurant to lure one of Zheng's sisters to the restaurant, where he then killed her. He dismembered the bodies over the course of eight hours and wrapped them in black plastic trash bags, which he then dumped into the ocean or threw into dumpsters. He recovered some money and a safe key from Zheng Lin's corpse and left the restaurant, choosing instead to stay the night at the Zheng's nearby residence. The next morning a delivery truck driver (the same one who had delivered goods to the Zhengs the previous afternoon) found the restaurant locked with a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed for three days. He visited the Zheng family home, where Huang answered the door, telling the delivery man that the Zheng family had left on a trip to the mainland. On 8 August 1985 a swimmer found eight pieces of human limbs on a nearby beach. It was originally suspected that either smugglers or sharks were involved, but an examination of the limbs revealed that precise cuts had been used to sever them. This finding prompted a police investigation and a search for potential missing persons. Over the next few days forensics determined that the limbs belonged to at least four separate people. A further three body parts were found on Macau's beaches over the following week. These findings generated significant interest in the press, and several theories were raised as to what had happened. The last body parts traceable to the Eight Immortals murders were found in a trash dump in 1989. Eventually the Macau police were able to discover that the severed limbs belonged to the Zheng family, who were reported missing by relatives. In the meantime, Huang had reopened and continued to operate the Eight Immortals Restaurant; this was considered unusual but not unwarranted as he was known to associate with the Zheng family and was in possession of the restaurant's ownership documents. He also began collecting rent from the Zheng family's former home. However, Macau police grew suspicious of Huang's activities and began investigating him. When they searched his bank holdings, they found documents belonging to Zheng Lin and student ID cards belonging to the missing Zheng children. Huang attempted to flee Macau for the Chinese mainland, but he was caught and arrested on 28 September 1986. He was charged with the murder of all ten members of the Zheng family, and was convicted on 2 October 1986. Huang's arrest and the revelation that he had been operating a restaurant for months after dismembering the eatery's former owners resulted in the urban legend that he had baked his victims into pork buns. Huang was attacked in prison by another inmate the day after his conviction. He was sent to a hospital to convalesce, where he attempted to escape without success. On 6 October he confessed to the murders and detailed to investigators how he had killed the Zheng family. He attempted suicide twice, succeeding the second time on 4 December 1986 by slicing his wrists on a trashcan lid. He left a suicide note and a letter to a local newspaper explaining his actions, stating in his note that his suicide was not due to his acceptance of his sins, but rather to escape his chronic asthma. = Film adaptation = The events surrounding the Eight Immortals Murders were depicted in the 1993 Hong Kong movie The Untold Story. The film featured a fictionalized version of the murder of the Zheng family, and notably played upon the rumors that cannibalism had occurred after the murders. In China the film was also released under the names The Human Pork Bun and Human Meat Roast Pork Buns.

Juliano-Villani painting's pull from a wide range of references including fashion, photography, illustration, and art history to create hyper-saturated scenes and portraits. Juliano-Villani lives and works in New York, NY.  Early life and education  Juliano-Villani grew up in Newark, New Jersey. As a daughter of commercial painters, Juliano-Villani spent much of her childhood in her parents silk-screening factory familiarizing herself with 1970s and 1980s graphic design. Juliano-Villani graduated from Rutgers University in 2013.  Work  Juliano-Villani's first solo exhibition, Me, Myself and Jah, opened at Rawson Projects in 2013. In an interview with Jonathan Griffin, featured on ARTnews, Juliano-Villani says of her work, > \\"My paintings are meant to function like TV, in a way. The viewer is > supposed to become passive. Instead of alluding or whispering, like a lot of > art does, this is art that tells you what‚Äôs up. It kind of does the work for > you, like TV does.\\" The following year, Juliano-Villani was included in the group show, Puddle, Pothole, Portal, curated by Camille Henrot and Ruba Katrib at SculptureCenter in Queens. In 2015, Juliano-Villani had her first solo museum show at Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Later that year, the artist presented new works at JTT gallery, titled Crypod. Writer and art critic Sarah Nicole Prickett writes for Artforum, \\"The best painting is the one that looks you square in the eyes, but its own eyes are scratched right out: Penny‚Äôs Change is a smear- up of a puffer-jacketed graffiti artist‚Äôs selfie and Peter Saul‚Äôs Mona Lisa Throws Up Pizza, 1995, with the kind of teeth‚Äîbig but mostly missing‚Äîthat appear to you in nightmares about money.\\" The artist has lectured at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and at the Swiss Institute alongside Brian Belott . In early 2018, Ten Pound Hand, Juliano-Villani's second show at JTT gallery, opened with positive reviews. Critic Zo√´ Lescaze writes that, \\"In Gone with the Wind (all works 2018), a cartoon fish gluts itself on Coca-Cola while a helpless-looking firefighter floats above burning California. October depicts an ash-choked Pompeian infant blowing across an empty school hallway. The linoleum floor is littered with shattered glass, in an eerie evocation of recent school shootings. Together, these works convey a loss of control, of entropy overriding security, idealism, and best-case scenarios.\\" Juliano- Villani sources a wide range of artists, animators, and illustrators in her work such as Chuck Jones, Marcell Jankovics, Ralph Bakshi, Bernard Szajner, R. Crumb, and more. She approaches each painting with a ‚Äúhyper-specific‚Äù concept in mind spending, workshopping various concepts together from archival and internet research. Juliano-Villani names Mike Kelley, John Wesley, Giorgio Morandi, Wendy White, and Gertrude Abercrombie as some of her favorite artists.

Biography Merz was born September 10, 1834 in Bensheim, near Frankfort-on-Main, Germany.. He received his early musical instruction from his father, a violinist and organist at the church in their hometown. But for the most part he is considered self-taught. By the age of eight or nine he was playing violin in a quartet club which met at the residence of Baron of Rodenstein. He is also known to have frequently played at \\"musical gatherings\\" at the castle of the baron of Rodenstein. At the age of eleven he had \\"assumed his father's duties as organist\\" at the church. He was educated at a seminary and graduated from college in 1853. For a year he taught school near Bingen am Rhein. During a trip home he met a man from Philadelphia who invited him to the United States. Accepting the invitation he arrived in the U.S. in late 1854. After losing a job as a store clerk in Philadelphia because of his lack of English he found a place with a band of musicians. For a year he was an organist at the Sixth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. Wolsieffer, who had a German musical journal, hired him as a critic for that publication. In 1856 Merz went to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. to teach at a seminary. Between 1859 and the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 he was somewhere in the South.Jones (1886), p.98 After returning to the North, around September 1861 he became a professor of music at Oxford Female College in Oxford, Ohio. {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; font-size: 90%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 30%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" As we enjoy sunsets the best when seen from our own porch, so music sounds sweetest in our own homes.

In 1882 he relocated to Wooster, Ohio and founded and organized the Musical Department at Wooster University. During his career he wrote a vast number of musical pieces consisting of operettas, sacred pieces, choruses, songs, piano solos, waltzes, dances, and pieces in almost every vocal and instrumental form.

Description  L. trifolii are relatively small flies for their family. The adults typically measure less than 2 mm in length. They are mostly yellow in color, although parts of the abdomen and thorax are dark brown or grey. They typically have yellow legs. A key distinction between L. trifolii and their very similar relatives, L. sativae, are L. trifolii's dark, matte mesonotum. Wing veins L. trifolii typically have a wingspan of 1.25 to 1.90 mm. Their wings are transparent and have veins in a similar pattern to that of flies in the Phytomyzinae subfamily.  Distribution  Originally, L. trifolii was solely found in Caribbean countries and the southeastern United States (specifically concentrated in southern Florida). However, export of produce and other vegetative goods from these areas has led to the dispersion of L. trifolii to several countries in Asia along the Pacific Ocean, as well as Europe, California, and certain parts of Canada. This human-facilitated dispersion occurred mostly after L. trifolii became resistant to certain insecticides and therefore were not killed off by the exports' treatment with insecticides before and after transport.  Habitat  L. trifolii are naturally found in tropical and subtropical regions. However, they frequently infest greenhouses and can now be found as an invasive species in a wider variety of climates. Because of this human-facilitated dispersion, L. trifolii can now be found in more temperate climates than they naturally would, although their development and survival is not as successful in the cooler climates.  Life History  Compared to other flies, L. trifolii have a relatively brief life cycle, ranging from 21 to 28 days in habitats they are native to. Because of this, there can be multiple generations of L. trifolii within one year in warm climates. Additionally, the rate of development for L. trifolii has been shown to be temperature-dependent. Maximum pupal survival rates and oviposition rates were shown to occur at 30ÀöC. = Eggs = The eggs are typically about 1 mm long, 0.2 mm wide, and oval in shape. Initially after oviposition, the eggs are clear, but they become creamy white in color as time goes on. Eggs are laid just below the surface of the leaf; when the larva hatch, they mine their way out of the leaf as they feed, hence the name \\"leaf miner\\". The eggs frequently fall victim to parasitoid wasps. = Larval Instars = Larval shape The larva of L. trifolii are unique from those of many other flies in their shape, as the body of L. trifolii larva does not taper at the head end. The larva are uniform in thickness at both their anterior and posterior ends but additionally have a pair of spiracles at the posterior end. They do not have legs and are initially clear in color, but gradually become yellow as they mature. The larval instars are differentiable by the lengths of the body and mouthparts. The first instar is recognizable by a mean body length of 0.39 mm and a mouthpart length of 0.10 mm. For the second instar, the mean measurements are 1.00 mm (body) and 0.17 mm (mouth). For the third instar, the mean measurements are 1.99 mm (body) and 0.25 mm (mouth). The fourth instar is a non-feeding stage and thus is usually disregarded. = Pupa = Typically, at the end of the larval phase, L. trifolii drop to the soil to pupate after exiting the leaf mines they have created. Initially, the puparium is yellow, but it grows to become a darker brown over time. The puparium is typically less than 2.3 mm long and 0.75 mm wide. = Adults = Adult female L. trifolii tend to live around 13 to 18 days. Male adults typically only live 2 to 3 days because they are unable to puncture plants and thus have difficulty feeding. As previously described, both males and females are typically around 2 mm in length with a wingspan around 1.25 mm. After chewing a fan shape into the leaf of their host plant, adults feed on exuding sap of the host plant on which oviposition will occur.  Food Resources  Both larval and adult female L. trifolii feed primarily on the leaves of their host plants. Larva feed mostly on the layer of the leaf just below the epidermis, while female adults feed on liquids expelled by the leaves after the adult has punctured them. L. trifolii feed on a large variety of host plants, including both vegetables and ornamental plants. Studies on the flies' preferred hosts show that some of L. trifolii's most preferable hosts are chrysanthemums, Gerber daisies, and celery. When the females are placed on preferable hosts, they produce more holes and show an increased rate of oviposition.300x300px  Mating  The ways in which L. trifolii signal readiness for mating are not entirely known. Researchers have not reported the presence of any sex pheromones, but L. trifolii may attract mates and signal readiness through a series of short-distance vocalization by the males. This vocalization also manifests into male L. trifolii rapidly \\"bobbing\\" up and down when nearby to females they would like to mate with. Males are typically not overly aggressive, but aggression between L. trifolii males has been observed in severely overcrowded laboratory conditions. During copulation, if a rival male approaches a pair, the mating male will repeatedly flex his wings until the rival is scared away. This is likely a display of his fitness through his wing size.  Parental Care  = Oviposition = Oviposition occurs within 24 hours of mating, usually during daylight hours. When oviposition is going to occur, the female punctures the host leaf in a tubular shape, feeding on the sap released from the leaf as she punctures. Oviposition typically occurs at a rate of 35 to 39 eggs per day. Females often lay a total of 200 to 400 eggs in their lifetime when on ideal hosts such as celery. Both the rate of oviposition and the total fecundity decrease when located on less ideal host plants, such as tomatoes. = Site Selection For Egg Laying = Leaf mines Eggs are typically oviposited on leaves toward the center of the host plant. Regardless of host plant, the female's first action is bending of the abdomen to position her ovipositor at the correct angle to the leaf. The ovipositor than contacts the leaf in a series of \\"rapid thrusts\\". The female punctures the leaf in either a fan shape or a tubular shape. The eggs are inserted into the tubular punctures on the bottom surface of the host leaf, just below the epidermis. This is where the larva will create its mine upon hatching. Oftentimes, the mother will make multiple punctures before selecting the ideal spot. Oviposition rate is significantly increased for female L. trifolii located on ideal host plants such as celery.  Enemies  = Parasites = Parasitoid wasp from family BraconidaeThe most significant natural threat to L. trifolii are parasitoid wasps. These wasps lay their eggs amongst the eggs of L. trifolii. When the wasps hatch, they typically devour the flies' nearby eggs, as is the defining characteristic of parasitoids. The most common parasitoids of L. trifolii are wasps from the families Braconidae, Eulophidae, and Pteromalidae. In the absence of insecticides, these parasitoids play a major role in keeping the L. trifolii population under control. = Predators = Although predators and diseases tend to impact the L. trifolii population to an insignificant amount compared to parasitoids, both larvae and adult L. trifolii can still be at risk of predation by general predators. The most common predators of L. trifolii are ants.  Interactions With Humans  L. trifolii is a highly destructive pest of both produce and ornamental plants. They often infest greenhouses and inhabit shipping containers, making them an invasive species in several countries around the globe. Because of this, they are a quarantine species in several countries, meaning their host plants are isolated for testing when L. trifolii are found on them. L. trifolii are most destructive to floricultural crops, which are severely impacted by any insect damage. Leaf miner abundance is assessed using a variety of sampling methods, including counting mines, counting live larvae, collecting pupae, and capturing adults. L. trifolii can be destructive to crops in many ways, including spreading diseases, destroying seedlings, and altering leaf production, which damages the fruits. All of these impacts on the crops decrease their value, which can be catastrophic to the industry. = Insecticide Resistance = Floriculture greenhouse The spread of this pest is widely due to the fly's developed resistance to certain insecticides. This has been a major issue combatted by attempts from the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association (FFVA) to mitigate the infestation and spread of these pests. However, due to previous spreading of L. trifolii through exported goods, L. trifolii are already a major pest of ornamentals in California. The California chrysanthemum industry lost approximately $93 million to damage caused by L. trifolii in the 1980s. Insecticides also kill off parasitoids that inhabit the area. Thus, the use of insecticides not only damages the ecosystem, but also reduces the population of the main form of biological control for L. trifolii.

It is commonly found in eastern California, Arizona and southwestern New Mexico north through Utah and southern Nevada to southern Idaho.  Ecology  Aeoloplides tenuipennis inhabits many parts of southern United States and northern Mexico. Its food plants inhabit Lower Sonoran life zone desert scrub, alkali flats, and grasslands. In southeastern Arizona, it is abundant on fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens ; it also occurs on cattle saltbush, Atriplex polycarpa, seepweed or seabite, Suaeda, greasewood, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, and introduced prickly Russian thistle, Salsola tra. The specialized chenopod diet includes noxious plants such as prickly Russian thistle (tumbleweed), and A. tenuipennis is generally considered innocuous to beneficial where cattle are grazed.  Economical Factors  Many species of grasshoppers, like Aeoloplides tenuipennis, have posed a threat to agricultural economy in regards to pest management. They have been known to alter crop life and decrease agricultural profits. Research has been done in understanding the early stages of the narrow-winged saltbush grasshopper, known as nymph stages, in order to decrease grasshopper destruction in a environmentally friendly manner.

Established in 1855, the newspaper typically consisted of four pages size 28x44 and was published every Friday.. Having served as senator in St. Croix County between 1889 and 1890 and many other political positions throughout his life, one of the paper‚Äôs editor, Horace A. Taylor, held strong Republican beliefs which he preached throughout the contents of the Hudson City Times. Aligning with this theme, the Hudson City Times had the tagline ‚ÄúWhere liberty dwells is my country,‚Äù a quote which is said to be from a letter that Benjamin Franklin wrote to Benjamin Vaughan on March 14, 1783. The paper had a $2 subscription fee and claimed to have a circulation of around 950 Origins The Hudson City Times was originally called the Hudson Chronicle before it was purchased by its editor, Horace A. Taylor. Mr. Taylor eventually purchased the Hudson Star and decided to combine it with the Hudson City Times in 1854, eventually creating a new weekly paper called the Hudson Times and Star which lasted nearly thirty years. About the Editor Horace Adolphus Taylor was born in St. Lawrence county, New York in 1837. After moving to River Falls, Wisconsin in 1855 spending his days working on a farm, Mr. Taylor tried his hand in real estate before eventually making his way to the newspaper business. He partnered with his brother Lute A. Taylor and created the River Falls Journal, but three years later decided to give the paper to his sibling. After doing so, he moved to Hudson, Wisconsin and purchased the Hudson Chronicle, which later became the Hudson City Times. The two brothers also owned the La Crosse Morning Leader, another newspaper, between 1869 and 1871. Mr. Taylor found himself very rewarded by his newspaper endeavors and used his earnings from the industry to invest in property, banking, lumber and mining. Horace was also very successful and influential in politics as a Republican delegate to the national conventions in 1876 and 1884, a chairman of the Republican state central committee from 1883 to 1887 and an agent for the St. Croix Land Grant from 1876 to 1881. The presidents at this time, James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, appointed him as U.S. Consul in Marseilles, France between 1881 and 1883, state senator from St. Croix County in 1889 until 1890 as well as the U.S. railroad commissioner. Mr. Taylor retired from the railroad commission in 1893 and went back to Madison, Wisconsin where he was also an editor for the Wisconsin State Journal, a leading Republican newspaper in the state for its time, when he lived between 1881 and 1901. His last appointment was assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C. where he eventually retired in 1906. Thereafter he returned to his home in Madison in 1906 until he passed away four years later.'Horace A.

According to the epic Aginid, Bayok sa atong Tawarik, a Bisayan epic story, Sri Lumay was a half-Tamil and half Malay minor prince of the Chola dynasty in Sumatra. Sri Lumay was the grandfather of Rajah Humabon. He may be called a semi-legendary figure, since no other written records mentions about Sri Lumay, other than in oral traditions in the Visayan epic story of Anginid. Legendary accounts Sri Lumay, or Rajahmura Lumaya, established the Rajahnate of Cebu. He was a prince of the that ruled Sumatra then. Initially, he was commissioned by the Maharajah to establish a base for their army force; instead, he created his own rajahnate which he himself ruled with his son, Sri Alho and Sri Ukob; they ruled the south known as Sialo, which included Valladolid, Carcar, up to Santander. The account of Aginid, Bayok sa atong Tawarik is about Sri Lumay of Sumatra who settled in Sugbo with his son, Sri Alho, ruling the south known as Sialo which included Valladolid, Carcar, up to Santander. Sri Lumay established the city of Singhapala that become the capital of the rajahnate and what is now part of Mabolo in the northern district of Cebu City. =Battle campaigns= Sri Lumay fought the Magalos or destroyers of peace , this is a Muslim Moro warriors who come from Mindanao , they had been raiding the island of Cebu in search for precious item like gold or ceramics and slaves. Sri Lumay was noted for his strict policies in defending against Moro Muslim raiders and slavers from Mindanao. His use of scorched earth tactics to repel invaders gave rise to the name Kang Sri Lumayang Sugbu (literally \\"that of Sri Lumay's great fire\\") to the town, which was later shortened to Sugbu (\\"scorched earth\\").https://web.archive.org/web/20120703210211/http://cebueskrima.s5.com/custom3.html In other folk stories, the problem about the Magalos where already an issue since the time of early Malay settlers during the time of the legendary Datu Daya who build a watch towers to watch the community against the up coming raids. =Death= He died in battle, fighting with the Muslim Moro pirates known as magalos from Mindanao. Sources The Anginid epic mentioned Sri Lumay, his works, where he came from, and how he established the rajahnate: Issue * Sri Ukob, ruled the north, known as Nahalin, which includes the present towns of Consolacion, Liloan, Compostela, Danao, Carmen, and Bantayan. * Sri Alho ruled over Sialo, which includes the present-day towns of Carcar and Santander in the southern region of Cebu.

M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung was the son of a fisherman in present-day Hai Phong and claimed to be descendant of M·∫°c Binh Chi, a scholar-official ...\\" M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung got his start as a bodyguard to the cruel and depraved monarch of Vietnam, L√™ Uy M·ª•c. M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung was famous for his strength and cunning. (For more information see the article on the L√™ Dynasty). Note that while some sources claim M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung was a Confucian scholar (government administrator) this seems to be the result of confusion with another notable Vietnamese scholar whose family name was also Mac. M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung was a military man who rose through the ranks.Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation D. R. SarDesai, p37, 1988 Despite several assassinations (both L√™ Uy M·ª•c and his successor L√™ T∆∞∆°ng D·ª±c were assassinated) M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung continued to gain power and rank in the military. With the enthronement of the young emperor L√™ Chi√™u T√¥ng in 1516, a power struggle in the court ensued. On the one side was M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung and his supporters (Mac was now the top general of the armies of Vietnam). On the other side were two noble families of Vietnam, the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn, led by Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Du and Tr·ªãnh Duy Dai and Tr·ªãnh Duy S·∫£n. Around 1520, the power struggle broke into civil war. The young emperor fled south to Thanh H√≥a Province along with the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn families. M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung soon proclaimed that the king's younger brother, Prince Xuan, was now the true monarch of Vietnam and had him installed under the name L√™ Cung Ho√†ng. Meanwhile, armies fought along the border of Thanh H√≥a Province. In 1524, forces loyal to M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung captured and executed the original emperor L√™ Chi√™u T√¥ng along with the leaders of the revolt (Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng Du, Tr·ªãnh Duy Dai, and Tr·ªãnh Duy S·∫£n). The revolt by the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn was defeated for the moment.  Emperor Minh ƒê·ª©c  Map of Vietnam showing the Mac in control of the north of Vietnam while the Nguy·ªÖn-Tr·ªãnh alliance controls the south and central part. In 1526, after murdering the former emperor L√™ Chi√™u T√¥ng, M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung proclaimed himself the new emperor of Vietnam under the name Minh ƒê·ª©c. Using ruthless methods, he forced the L√™ officials to recognize his dynasty and he murdered the members of the L√™ family who still remained in the north including the deposed emperor L√™ Cung Ho√†ng and his mother. Some government officials committed suicide rather than acknowledge M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung as emperor, but others fled south and joined the resistance. Yet another rebellion was launched, this time under the leadership of Nguy·ªÖn Kim and his son-in-law Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm. Appeals from the Tr·ªãnh and Nguy·ªÖn were made to the Chinese Ming court to send in an army to remove the usurper. However M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung, using submissive behavior and bribery, managed to obtain a temporary recognition of his rule from the Ming dynasty in 1528. The murder of the L√™ emperor provoked unrest and the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn revolted against the rule of M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung. Nominally the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn were fighting on behalf of another L√™ emperor, L√™ Trang T√¥ng, but in reality, he (and all future L√™ monarchs) had no power. In 1529 M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung abdicated in favor of his son, M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Doanh, thus establishing his dynasty.  Retirement and rule again  M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung lived on as a retired emperor while his son had to deal with the continuing revolt by the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn. His son was not the equal of his father and as a result of several defeats, he lost control of the provinces south of the Red River. In 1533, the Nguy·ªÖn-Tr·ªãnh army conquered the Winter Palace and proclaimed L√™ Trang T√¥ng the rightful ruler of Vietnam. Adding to the problems of military defeats, an official Chinese delegation determined that M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung's usurpation was not justified and so, in 1537 a very large army was dispatched to Vietnam under the pretense of restoring the L√™ family to power. In the summer, with the Chinese invading the north, Dung's son Doanh died and so Dung resumed his former position as emperor. The Ming Chinese threatened M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung with an invasion of 110,000 men ready to invade Vietnam from Guangxi in 1540. Mac succumbed and caved in to Chinese pressure and accepted the bitter demands the Chinese made, including crawling barefoot in front of the Chinese, giving up land to China, downgrading the status of his polity from a country to a chieftaincy and giving up official documents like tax registers to the Ming.http://www.eacrh.net/ojs/index.php/crossroads/article/view/43/Vol8_Yamazaki_html The Chinese accepted him as ruler over a part of Vietnam while he claimed to accept L√™ rule over the southern part of Vietnam. But the Nguy·ªÖn and the Tr·ªãnh refused to accept this division and so the war continued in the south. M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung died in 1541 and de facto authority was transferred to his grandson M·∫°c Hi·∫øn T√¥ng. Despite the Chinese recognition and his rule over much of Vietnam, later Vietnamese historians question the legitimacy of his reign. The usurpation by M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung split the kingdom, with the M·∫°c Dynasty reigning in the north, and the L√™ Dynasty continuing in the south, supported by the Tr·ªãnh lords and the Nguy·ªÖn Lords.

It is found in Western Atlantic Ocean. Distribution The Acadian hermit crab, also known as Pagurus acadianus, can be found in the Western Atlantic Ocean, including areas such as the Vineyard Sound. In addition, the Acadian hermit crab has been cited as the most abundant species of crab in Salisbury Cove, Maine by William C. Grant, Jr, during his extensive study of hermit crabs populating this area in 1961. History Pagurus acadianus was first identified in scientific literature by scientist J.E. Benedict in 1901. As examined by Morris H. Roberts, Jr.‚Äôs, Benedict was able to differentiate this organism from that of a very similar taxa, Pagurus benhardus, due to physical variations. Benedict observed that Pagurus acadianus had larger eyestalks, shorter fingers of the chelae and sharper chelipeds, all of which are necessary identifiers of the Acadian hermit crab. Taxonomically, the Acadian hermit crab belongs to the Arthropoda phyla. Arthropods belong to the most populous animal phylum, with a recorded million (and counting) species. Arthropods include crustaceans and insects, and are characterized by the breadth of their variation in morphology, or their relationship among similar organisms based on comparisons between physical, chemical and taxonomic similarities. This can often be seen through the use of phylogenetic trees and cladograms. The Acadian hermit crab belongs to the Pagurus genera, along with the hairy hermit crab, or Pagurus pubescens, and the aforementioned Pagurus bernhardus. The abundance of their populations is seasonally dependent, with a peak in richness in the month of June, and a staggering decrease from the months of November to March. In addition, they are most plentiful in seawater temperatures ranging from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 41 degrees Fahrenheit. The Acadian hermit crab has most often been observed in its fossilized state, with 95.4% of occurrences being recorded as preserved specimen. With only 4.4% of occurrences being living organisms, there is much to know about this creature, and whether its ecological niche is similar to that of its common ancestors. Reproduction and development Though very little is known on the specific reproductive behavior of Pagurus acadianus, information on their adolescence was attained by Roberts during his laboratory studies of this species. Roberts found that the incubation period of the larva is approximately 30 days, and the optimal temperature during gestation is 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Once they hatch, the size of the eggs is about 0.58 by 0.64 millimeters, and can be distinguished by varying hues of red and yellow coloration, in addition to distinctive eyespots. Both larval and adult Acadian hermit crabs are often confused with the closely related Pagurus berhnardus, or the common marine hermit crab of western Europe, and this comparison has been the focal point of many scientific evaluations, as demonstrated by Benedict's work. Habitat As examined by Jennifer E. Angel in her paper, hermit crabs are known to inhabit different shells throughout their lifetimes, switching from shell to shell as a result of growth. Increased growth means increased shell size, because inhabiting a shell that is too small for the crab's body results in an increase in predation and desiccation. Pagurus acadianus are often found inhabiting the shells of Littorina littorea, Thais lapillus, Buccium undatum, and Polinices heros, as concluded by William C Grant, Jr. Larger individuals are often located on elevated areas within the rocky intertidal, which is defined as the area between the highest high tides and the lowest low tides. This area is one of much scientific exploration, due to its accessibility and the adaptations of the organisms that live there. These organisms have to face daily variation in salinity, exposure to sunlight and lack of food. Small individuals can be found on wharf piling and vertical faces of rock. This area can also be defined as the midway region of the rocky intertidal zone. This species of hermit crab has been observed to be quite aggressive, therefore yielding staggering amounts of both intraspecific and interspecific competition. Smaller individuals have been recorded to be more aggressive and dominant, which may be the result of an adaptation to accommodate for smaller size. Diet The diet of these organisms, like many other species of hermit crab, includes macroscopic animals and detritus, due to the fact that hermit crabs are classified as omnivorous detritivores. In addition, the bulk of their nutrient intake comes from detritus, classified by many marine scientists as ‚Äúmarine snow‚Äù. They consume their food sources through proteolytic enzymes that split carbohydrates and lipids. Threats Some of the threats to this species include a microbial infection, which is the result of the fungus Fusarium solani. This fungus causes lesions, attack of the dermis, and mixed inflammatory response, therefore reducing the organism's ability to fight off infection. In addition, larval parasitic nematodes, such as Hysterothylacium aduncum, have been reported to infect this species of hermit crab and hosts itself as a parasite within the individual. One to three of these parasitic nematodes were observed per hermit crab by David J. Marcogliese during his study of nematodes of the past of Eastern Canada, and defined Hysterothylacium aduncum as intestinal parasites. Though not much is known on their affect to the organisms with which they inhabit, their position within the gut of their host may be in order to consume the food that the organism has ingested, causing possible starvation to the host. A common invasive species affecting Pagurus acadianus is the Asian shore crab, Hermigraspus sanguineus, which outcompetes many different species of crab as a result of being aggressive interspecific competitors. The introduction of this invasive species was first observed in New Jersey in 1988. In their work, Christopher P. Bloch, Kevin D. Curry, and John C. Jahoda attribute their occurrence to international commerce and global travel. Defenses Acadian hermit crabs have been cited to have two major defense mechanisms: fleeing when approached in the face of predation, or curling up and hiding in their shells. They decide which tactic to use depending on cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. Like many terrestrial and marine organisms alike, Pagurus acadianus will choose either method depending on the exhaustion of energy or the depleted availability of food during a threat.

On 2 January 1892, Francis Augustin Henschke was born into a Polish-German family, in Hookina, which is located in the South Australian outback. His parents were August Henschke and Anne Michael. On 16 November 1939, he was appointed the Bishop of Wagga Wagga. He kept this position until his death on 24 February 1968. Henschke Primary School, Wagga Wagga, is named after him. Family The Henschke line began in Australia when George Henschke and his Polish wife, along with their first daughter and seven children from his first marriage, migrated to Australia from Posen, Poland. George's daughter later became Sister M. Annette, who was a founding member of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, whose most notable member is Mary MacKillop. His maternal grandparents both came from Bavaria, his maternal grandfather, John Michael, migrated to South Australia in 1848 with Franz Weikert, who went on to form the Sevenhill settlement. His maternal grandmother immigrated in 1854. On 2 January 1892, Francis Augustin Henschke was born to parents August Henschke and Anne Michael. He had 8 siblings, six brothers and two sisters, and another two sisters had died early in life. His whole family was quite tall, with Bishop Henschke's 6' 4\\" not being the tallest in the family. Seven of his family members devoted themselves to God and religious life. His two sisters became religious sisters, one brother a brother and three brothers (including him) became priests. Early life His early education was provided by both his parents, and a small local school. Later, he was enrolled at Sacred Heart College, Glenelg, South Australia. There he completed his secondary studies. Shortly thereafter, he took up a teaching position for the Department of Education in Adelaide, South Australia. He soon offered himself as a candidate for priesthood to The Reverend John H. Norton, the Bishop of Port Augusta. Priestly studies To do his study of philosophy, he was sent to Ireland, studying at the famous monastic college of Mount Melleray Abbey, then headed to Propaganda College in Rome, where he completed his theological studies. Prior to commencing this study of theology, he received a Doctorate in Philosophy. This degree was rarely mentioned in his later life. He was ordained a priest on 2 June 1917, at the Basilica of St John Lateran, by Cardinal Pompili. Positions After his ordination, he was appointed to the position of Assistant Priest of Hawker, South Australia, where he stayed for a little over a year. He then moved to Jamestown, where he became the Curate for ten years. He stayed at Jamestown for nine more years, but as priest. While in Jamestown, he received many diocesan positions. In 1924, he was appointed as the Chancellor of the Diocese. Then, in 1929, a Diocesesan Consultor. Finally, he took the position of Vicar-General in 1935. At the time he was appointed as a bishop, he was holding all these positions simultaneously. The process of becoming a bishop began when Joseph Wilfrid Dwyer, then Bishop of Wagga Wagga, asked Pope Pius XI to grant him the aid of an auxiliary bishop. On 20 May 1937, Henschke was appointed as the Auxiliary Bishop of Wagga Wagga and the Titular Bishop of Praenetus. His consecration took place at Saint Anacletus' Cathedral on 15 August 1937. The chief consecrating Prelate was the Most Rev. Dr Andrew Killian, Archbishop of Adelaide. He was assisted by Most Rev. N. T. Gilroy who had been bishop in his old diocese and had recently been appointed co- adjudicator of Sydney and the Bishop of Wilcannia-Forbes the Most Rev. Dr Fox who had been a companion of Henschke at school and the seminary. Three priests from the Diocese of Wagga, which the Bishop was headed to, were also at the ceremony. These were Dean Hartigan of Narrandera, also known as the poet John O'Brien, Dr Harper and Fr L. Hatswell. Upon his arrival in Wagga, Bishop Henschke was appointed the Parish Priest of Junee, as well as the Vicar- General of the diocese. Due to the ill health of Bishop Dwyer, Henschke did extensive travel around the diocese.
