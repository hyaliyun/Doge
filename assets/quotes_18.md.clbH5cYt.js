In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and served after that in the Soviet Navy as T-283. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-131, Candid was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-154, on 21 February 1942. She was launched on 14 October 1942 at Portland, Oregon, by Willamette Iron and Steel Works and commissioned on 31 October 1943 with Lieutenant E. G. Bemis, USNR, in command. Service history Candid departed San Francisco, California, on 28 February 1944 for duty in the waters of the Territory of Alaska. Called upon to escort convoys and conduct patrols as well as to sweep for mines, she sailed through stormy waters to fog-bound ports in the Aleutian Islands, supporting United States Army units on the isolated islands and backing up U.S. Navy attacks on the Kuril Islands of northern Japan. She returned to San Francisco on 18 August 1944, and two weeks later got underway for the Marshall Islands for operations there and in the Mariana Islands, providing local escort services in support of the consolidation of these islands and their development as bases for naval and air strikes against the Japanese. On 16 April 1945, Candid got underway for Seattle, Washington and an overhaul. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - she departed Seattle in the summer of 1945 after the completion of her overhaul and proceeded to Cold Bay to begin familiarization training for her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1958= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Candid was decommissioned on 17 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-283 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Candid to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-154 on 7 February 1955. Disposal The Soviet Navy struck T-283 from its vessel register in 1958. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Candid on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

The by-election was caused by the death of Conservative Party Member of Parliament Martin Maddan. Hove was a safe Conservative seat, having been held by the party since its creation for the 1950 general election. At the 1970 general election, the Conservatives had won over two-thirds of the votes cast. The Conservative candidate was Tim Sainsbury, a member of the board of supermarket chain J Sainsbury plc. Former Labour Party MP Desmond Donnelly was unsuccessful in getting the Conservative nomination. Labour, who had put up the only other candidate in 1970, stood Ronald Wallis. The Liberal Party, who had not stood a candidate in 1970, but had won 16% of the vote in 1966, stood New Zealand-born Des Wilson, one of the founders of Shelter. Two other candidates stood. The far right National Front stood John Harrison-Broadley, a former Royal Air Force Squadron LeaderNational Front candidate Sqn. - Ldr. John Harrison-Broadley and bobsleigh champion, while the Maoist Communist Party of England (Marxist-Leninist) stood Carole Reakes. Results Sainsbury held the seat for the Conservatives, although the party now gained less than half of the votes cast. This was largely due to a strong result for Wilson, who took the Liberals into second place, while the Labour vote fell sharply; Labour in fact lost their deposit. Sainsbury held the seat until he stood down at the 1997 general election. Wilson became the Vice Chair of the Liberal Party, and later the Campaign Director for the Liberal Democrats at the 1992 general election.

It was loosely based on the novel Sangre y arena of Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez, which had been adapted for the screen three times before, in 1916, 1922 and 1941. Plot The story revolves around the young and talented natural gifted Torero Juan Gallardo (Christopher Rydell). Juan wants to be popular in bullfighting. One night, Juan takes the cousin of his love Carmen (Ana Torrent) with him for a bullfighting competition. They successfully earn some level and skills in the arena, but something goes wrong. As the bull charges at Juan, his friend saves Gallardo at the cost of his own life. Juan then leaves, and meets a beautiful rich woman named Do√±a Sol (Sharon Stone), the daughter of a wealthy landowner. Lady Do√±a Sol offers Juan an opportunity to join her company as a worker of her fields and lands, but Juan insists on becoming a superstar as a bullfighter in his country. As Juan leaves her home, a security guard tells him to join the bullfighting trainer Nacional (Albert Vidal). Nacional trains Juan until he is able to join the national bullfighting competition. Another one of Juan's friends named Garabato (Guillermo Montesinos) also joins him. Juan displays brilliant skills in his first appearance of national league and his popularity rises. Juan then marries Carmen, and his popularity increases weeks after weeks. Juan soon develops a crush on Lady Do√±a Sol, which starts a dramatic twist in the movie. As time passes, Juan falls deeply in love with Lady Do√±a Sol and offers to marry her, but Lady Do√±a Sol isn't interested in marrying him. Carmen finally visits Lady Do√±a Sol to talk about Juan, but instead, Lady Do√±a Sol shows where Juan is hiding. That night, Juan goes to a midnight bar. Against the advice of Nacional, Juan gets drunk and hangs out with some bar girls. Nacional advises Juan to focus on the competition for the next day. In response, Juan kicks Nacional and asks him to leave; an angry Nacional complies and storms out of the bar. Juan and Lady Do√±a Sol go to a popular city hotel, where Juan's rival, Pepe Serrano, is present. Juan angrily punches Serrano after he tries to make a move on Lady Do√±a Sol, but Serrano takes her anyway. The next day, Juan drunkenly goes to the office of his manager Don Jose, accompanied by two girls. Nacional admonishes Juan again, and in response, Juan slaps him hard; Nacional gives up on teaching Juan. To make amends for cheating on Carmen, Juan calls Carmen and apologizes, but Carmen does not forgive him. The next day, the bullfight commences; Juan begins failing to control the bull. At the same time, Carmen and Juan's mother pray for him, while Juan's brother-in-law Antonio advises Carmen to go help Juan and forgive him. As Carmen enters the stands, Nacional sees her and runs to Juan, telling him that Carmen has come to watch him. Before Juan begins the competition, he throws his cap to Carmen as an apology. Juan gives an outstanding performance, but in the final move, where he is about to kill the bull with his sword, the bull suddenly charges towards Juan, goring him in the stomach. The bull then throws him to the ground several times. Paramedics arrive and immediately take Juan to the emergency trauma room. Concerned for Juan, Carmen and Nacional follow them; Juan dies from the trauma and blood loss, and Carmen and Nacional walk away weeping. Back in the arena, Serrano defeats the bull, winning the competition, and he is escorted out of the arena.

It was conceived by Bertram Lamb, who took the role of Uncle Dick, signing himself (B.J.L.) in an early book, and was drawn until c. 1939 by Austin Bowen Payne, who always signed as A. B. Payne. It concerned the adventures of an orphaned family of animals. Pip, who assumed the \\"father\\" role, was a dog, while the \\"mother\\", Squeak, was a penguin. Wilfred was the \\"young son\\" and was a rabbit with very long ears.  Character beginnings  The characters Pip, Squeak and Wilfred were created by Bertram Lamb, a journalist on the Daily Mirror, who was born in Islington, London, on 14 May 1887 and died in Switzerland in 1938. He never drew the cartoons, but thought up the idea of the characters. The origins of the characters are mentioned in the cartoon strips. Squeak was found in the London Zoological Gardens after hatching on the South African coast years before. Pip was discovered begging by a policeman on the Thames Embankment, and was sent to a dogs' home, where he was bought for half-a-crown. Wilfred was found in a field near his burrow and was adopted by Pip and Squeak, who were in turn looked after by Uncle Dick and Angeline, the housemaid of their family house on the edge of London.  The WLOG fanclub  In 1927 the Pip, Squeak and Wilfred club began.GRAVETT, Paul, \\"1001 Comics You Should Read Before You Die\\", Universe, page 53. It was named the Wilfredian League of Gugnuncs (WLOG) and organised many competitions and events for thousands of members, especially at the British South Coast Seaside resorts. \\"Gugnuncs\\" is a combination of two baby-talk words used by Wilfred, who as a toddler-aged rabbit cannot speak yet, nunc being his version of uncle. There was a WLOG member's badge in blue enamelled metal, featuring the long ears of Wilfred. Among the WLOG rules was one to never eat rabbit.  Cartoon films  A series of silent animated cartoons were produced in 1921 by Lancelot Speed, titled \\"The Wonderful Adventures of Pip, Squeak & Wilfred\\".GRAVETT, Paul, \\"1001 Comics You Should Read Before You Die\\", Universe, page 53. Twenty‚Äìfive 5-minute shorts were made (being paired with the Mirror-Pictorial Newsreel), and were first‚Äìshown between 17 February 1921 and 11 August 1921. Titles included 'Pip And Wilfred Detectives', 'Over The Edge Of The World', 'The Six-Armed Image', 'The Castaways', 'Ups And Downs', 'Popski's Early Life', 'Wilfred's Nightmare', 'Wilfred's Wonderful Adventures' and 'Trouble In The Nursery'. None appear to be currently available in any format. Pip & Squeak Annual 1936  Annuals  An early book was Pip, Squeak & Wilfred, Their \\"Luvly\\" Adventures, issued in 1921 by Stanley Paul & Co, London. This book recapped on the earliest Daily Mirror strips, showing how they were introduced. Luvly being one of Squeak's favourite words. Pip and Squeak Annuals appeared each year from 1922, dated as the 1923 to 1939 annuals. A separate Wilfred's Annual also appeared, dated 1924 to 1938, featuring stories aimed at under-10 year olds. The 1934 Pip & Squeak Annual featured a 'magic red frame' which allowed the reader to see hidden pictures on several pages. The 1934 Wilfred's Annual similarly featured a Pantomime cut-out insert. The final Pip & Squeak annual of 1939 incorporated Wilfred's Annual, which had ended the previous year, and is the rarest of the series due to low sales and poor quality paper being used. No annual was issued in 1940. The annuals continued the 1920s type of fairyland surrealism in their pages until the last annual, by which time other more popular annuals such as Bobby Bear and Teddy Tail were more contemporary, leaving this series appearing rather dated in comparison, meaning later years of Pip and Squeak annual and especially Wilfred's annual sold in smaller quantities. There were three Uncle Dick's Annuals issued from 1929 to 1931, dated as the 1930 to 1932 annuals, the first one being fully named 'Uncle Dick's Competition Annual'. These annuals were aimed more at boys, with action stories and very little Pip & Squeak content. As their title suggests, the books were in an elaborate competition format where you had to solve quizzes, paint in pictures and similar to win prizes. A short-lived revived Pip, Squeak & Wilfred annual was issued in the mid-1950s, as the characters had been revived in the Daily Mirror a few years previously. This featured the characters updated and now drawn by a new, uncredited, artist. A newly bow-tied Wilfred and a younger Auntie, both previously only saying the odd nonsensical word, were now made to speak fully, losing the innocence and surreal charm of the pre-war years, to better fit the 1950s. Stanley, a young penguin, became a regular character, having been introduced in the later 1930s annuals. The annual featured stories with the characters as well as cartoon strips and other non-related stories. A small paperback comic book, Adventures of Pip Squeak & Wilfred was published in the early 1920s in the Merry Miniatures series by Home Publicity of London, and was just in size.  Newspaper supplements  The Daily Mirror featured a Saturday 4-page pull-out comic supplement, starting on Saturday, 15 October 1921, titled The Adventures of Pip, Squeak and Wilfred : No 1 - Thrills in the Printing Works. Later editions were reduced to 3 pages on 25 March 1922, then to 2 pages on 8 July 1922 until the supplement ended in 1924. The popularity of Pip, Squeak & Wilfred was immense. The 16 December 1922 edition of the Daily Mirror reported 100,000 copies of the 1923 Pip and Squeak Annual had been sold. In military terminology =War medals= After the First World War (1914‚Äì18), three medals were awarded to most of the British servicemen who had served from 1914 or 1915.

During the Second World War, Pip-squeak was the code name of a radio‚Äìnavigation system fitted to some RAF fighters. This periodically transmitted 15-second tones from the aircraft's radio. These signals were used by ground-based radio direction finder stations to determine the location of the aircraft. In early 1944 the radio callsign GUGNUNC was used by No. 255 Squadron RAF in southern Italy. The squadron's Operations Record Book makes specific reference to this in the context of a search for a missing Beaufighter.The National Archives, file AIR27/1519 at folio 17. = Palestine, 1936 = \\"Pip\\", a truck-mounted QF 2-pounder naval gun, during operations against the Arab Revolt in Palestine, 1936.

As the software gets older it becomes less immune and will eventually stop functioning as it should, therefore rebooting or reinstalling the software can be seen as a short term fix. A proactive fault management method to deal with the software aging incident is software rejuvenation. This method can be classified as an environment diversity technique that usually is implemented through software rejuvenation agents (SRA). From both an academic and industrial point of view, the software aging phenomenon has increased. The main focus has been to understand its effects from a verifiable observation and theoretical understanding. \\"Programs, like people, get old. We can't prevent aging, but we can understand its causes, take steps to limit its effects, temporarily reverse some of the damage it has caused, and prepare for the day when the software is no longer viable.\\" Memory bloating and leaking, along with data corruption and unreleased file-locks are particular causes of software aging.  Proactive management of software aging  = Software aging = Software failures are a more likely cause of unplanned systems outages compared to hardware failures. This is because software exhibits over time an increasing failure rate due to data corruption, numerical error accumulation and unlimited resource consumption. In widely used and specialized software, a common action to clear a problem is rebooting because aging occurs due to the complexity of software which is never free of errors. It is almost impossible to fully verify that a piece of software is bug-free. Even high-profile software such as Windows and macOS must receive continual updates to improve performance and fix bugs. Software development tends to be driven by the need to meet release deadlines rather than to ensure long-term reliability. Designing software that can be immune to aging is difficult. Not all software will age at the same rate as some users use the system more intensively than others. = Rejuvenation = To prevent crashes or degradation software rejuvenation can be employed proactively as inevitable aging leads to failures in software systems. This proactive technique was identified as a cost-effective solution during research at the AT&T; Bell Laboratories on fault-tolerant software in the 1990s.Cotroneo, D., Natella, R., Pietrantuono, R., and Russo, S. 2014. A survey of software aging and rejuvenation studies. ACM J. Emerg. Technol. Comput. Syst. 10, 1, Article 8 (January 2014), 34 pages. Software rejuvenation works by removing accumulated error conditions and freeing up system resources, for example by flushing operating system kernel tables, using garbage collection, reinitializing internal data structures, and perhaps the most well known rejuvenation method is to reboot the system. There are simple techniques and complex techniques to achieve rejuvenation. The method most individuals are familiar with is the hardware or software reboot. A more technical example would be the web server software Apache's rejuvenation method. Apache implements one form of rejuvenation by killing and recreating processes after serving a certain number of requests.Trivedi, K. S. and Vaidyanathan, K. 2007. Software Aging and Rejuvenation. Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering. Another technique is to restart virtual machines running in a cloud computing environment. The multinational telecommunications corporation AT&T; has implemented software rejuvenation in the real time system collecting billing data in the United States for most telephone exchanges. Some systems which have employed software rejuvenation methods include: # Transaction processing systems # Web servers # Spacecraft systems The IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE) hosted the 5th annual International Workshop on Software Aging and Rejuvenation (woSAR) in 2013. Topics included: * Design, implementation, and evaluation of rejuvenation mechanisms * Modeling, analysis, and implementation of rejuvenation scheduling * Software rejuvenation benchmarking  Memory leaks  In systems that use an OS user programs have to request memory blocks in order to perform an operation. After this operation (e.g. a subroutine) is completed, the program is expected to free up all the memory blocks allocated for it in order to make it available to other programs for use. In programming languages without a garbage collector (e.g. C and C++) it's up to the programmer to call the necessary memory releasing functions and to account for all the unused data within the program. However this doesn't always happen. Due to software bugs the program might consume more and more memory eventually causing the system to run out of memory. In low memory conditions, the system usually functions slower due to the performance bottleneck caused by intense swapping (thrashing), applications become unresponsive and those that request large amounts of memory unexpectedly may crash. In case the system runs out of both memory and swap even the OS might crash causing the whole system to reboot. Programs written in programming languages that use a garbage collector (e.g. Java) usually rely on this feature for avoiding memory leaks. Thus the \\"aging\\" of these programs is at least partially dependent on the quality of the garbage collector built into the programming language's runtime environment itself. Sometimes critical components of the OS itself can be a source of memory leaks and be the main culprit behind system stability issues. In Microsoft Windows, for example, the memory use of Windows Explorer plug-ins and long-lived processes such as services can impact the reliability of the system to the point of making it unusable. A reboot might be needed to make the system work again. Software rejuvenation helps with memory leaks as it forces all the memory used by an application to be released. The application can be restarted but starts with a clean slate. Implementation Two methods for implementing rejuvenation are: # Time based rejuvenation # Prediction based rejuvenation  Memory bloating  Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management whereby the system automatically recovers unused memory. For example, the .NET Framework manages the allocation and release of memory for software running under it. But automatically tracking these objects takes time and is not perfect. .NET based web services manage several logical types of memory such as stack, unmanaged and managed heap (free space). As the physical memory gets full, the OS writes rarely used parts of it to disk, so that it can reallocate it to another application, a process known as paging or swapping. But if the memory does need to be used, it must be reloaded from disk. If several applications are all making large demands, the OS can spend much of its time merely moving data between main memory and disk, a process known as disk thrashing. Since the garbage collector has to examine all of the allocations to decide which are in use, it may exacerbate this thrashing. As a result, extensive swapping can lead to garbage collection cycles extended from milliseconds to tens of seconds. This results in usability problems.  References   Further reading  * R.

Large jumping sturgeons can inflict serious injuries to humans who get in the way. The Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) is a subspecies of sturgeon that lives in the Gulf of Mexico and some rivers draining into it. The Gulf sturgeon was first recognized as a separate subspecies in 1955. The nominate subspecies is the Atlantic sturgeon, A. o. oxyrinchus. The Gulf sturgeon is listed as threatened under the United States Endangered Species Act, having been listed in 1991. Critical habitat, reflecting the current range of the subspecies, has been designated (see map). The historical range is thought to have been from the Suwannee River on the western coast of Florida to the Mississippi River, and marine waters of the central and eastern portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Three sturgeon species in genus Scaphirhynchus share river territory with the Gulf sturgeon; none of these is anadromous.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. 1995. Gulf Sturgeon Recovery Plan. Atlanta, Georgia.  Physical appearance  Visually, Gulf sturgeon are almost impossible to differentiate from Atlantic sturgeon, as the most significant morphological difference is the spleen length, which is internal. Gulf sturgeon have a spleen length averaging 12.3% of their fork length, while Atlantic sturgeon have a spleen length averaging 5.7% of their fork length. Lesser morphological differences include relative head length, shape of dorsal scutes, and pectoral fin length. Genetic differences between the subspecies have been studied, and tend to indicate reproductive isolation occurred in the Pleistocene period. Behavioral differences are more clear, especially the dietary habits. Adult Gulf sturgeon eat primarily, or possibly only, during the winter, when they are in marine or brackish water, and eat little to nothing during the remainder of the year when they are in rivers. Their weights vary in accordance with this eating pattern, with significant weight gains in the winter and smaller weight losses in the summer. Because their diet consists of mollusks that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), in addition to other bottom-dwelling organisms such as grass shrimp, marine worms, isopods, and amphipods, their unique feeding pattern possibly reflects an adaptation to prevent PSP that coincides with higher rates of algal blooms in summer.  Lifecycle  Juvenile Gulf sturgeon remain in the spawning river until roughly two years of age, eating there. Thereafter, they join the adults in their anadromous migrations and eating habits. The upriver migration normally occurs between February and April, as river temperatures rise to 16 to 23 ¬∞C. Downriver migration normally begins in late September or October when water temperatures drop to 23 ¬∞C. Males reach sexual maturity between seven and 12 years of age, females between eight and 17 years of age. Spawning almost always occurs in the natal river, generally over a hard bottom just downstream of a spring on the river bottom feeding groundwater into the river. After spawning, the adults and older juveniles collect in regions of cooler, deeper, slower-flowing water, generally downstream of springs.  Jumping  All species of sturgeon leap out of the water at times. The Gulf sturgeon tends to jump during July and August, and again early during the offshore feeding period. They are thought to jump to communicate and maintain group cohesion. Due to their heavy body armor, large leaping sturgeon can inflict serious injuries to humans who are in the way.Biological Profiles: Gulf sturgeon, Florida Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 5 July 2015. On July 2, 2015, a leaping sturgeon on the Suwannee River in Florida struck and killed a 5-year- old girl.Leaping Sturgeon Kills 5-Year-Old Florida Girl Boating With Family NBCNews.com, 5 July 2015.  Population controls  Predators of the sturgeon, other than humans, are unknown, but thought to have limited impact upon the species. Parasites include the fish louse Argulus stizostehi, nematodes, trematodes, and leeches. No detrimental impacts from these parasites have been observed. The species also serves as host to the glochidia (larvae) of three freshwater mussel species. Overfishing and dam construction probably contributed to the historical decline in populations.

Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945= After reporting to the Pacific Fleet for assignment, Capable cleared San Francisco, California, on 8 February 1944 bound for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, and Majuro in the Marshall Islands. Arriving at Majuro on 9 March 1944, she was based there until October 1944, serving as a convoy escort, voyaging to Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, Tarawa, Eniwetok, Manus, and Makin as the United States built up its fleet bases in the Pacific to support offensive operations against the Japanese. Moving on to the more advanced base at Eniwetok, she served on local patrol and escort in the Mariana Islands, and in February 1945 escorted a convoy to Ulithi as part of the preparations for the invasion of Iwo Jima. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Capable arrived at Seattle, Washington on 6 April 1945 for pre-transfer overhaul. With her overhaul complete, she arrived at Cold Bay on 11 July 1945 to begin familiarization training of her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Capable was decommissioned on 17 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-339 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Capable to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-155 on 7 February 1955. Disposal T-339 was scrapped in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Capable on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

Mansonella perstans is one of two filarial nematodes that causes serous cavity filariasis in humans. The other filarial nematode is Mansonella ozzardi. M. perstans is widespread in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Compared to infections with other filarial parasites such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Loa loa, Mansonella infections are relatively mild. However, the pathogenicity of M. perstans infection has been recently reconsidered in various studies. These studies have demonstrated that M. perstans has the ability to induce a variety of clinical features, including angioedema Calabar-like swellings, pruritus, fever, headache, eosinophilia, and abdominal pain. The overall disability among populations in regions where filariae are endemic has been difficult to determine because of high rates of coinfection with other filariae and the nonspecificity of M. perstan infections. Furthermore, treatment of M. perstans is challenging because the most antifilarial drugs, such as ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole are not effective. The optimal treatment for M. perstans infection remains unclear. Most current studies are focused on coinfection of M. perstans with other filarial parasites, and the study of Wolbachia bacteria as endosymbionts in M. perstans and other filarial parasites. History of discovery In 1890, the microfilariae of M. perstans were first discovered by Manson in the blood of a patient from West Africa who was hospitalized with sleeping sickness in London. Because the microfilariae were first noted in a patient with African trypanosomiasis, M. perstans was initially suspected to be the cause of this disease. M. perstans as the cause of African trypanosomyasis was later ruled out by the Royal Society Sleeping Sickness Commission, who showed the geographical distribution of sleeping sickness did not coincide with that of M. perstans infection. Upon their discovery, the microfilariae were named Filaria sanguinis hominis minor, due to their relatively small size when compared to another type of microfilarae found in the same patient (Filaria sanguinis hominis major, which is now known as Loa loa). The name was later changed to Filaria sanguinis hominis perstans, and later again shortened to Filaria perstans to comply with the binary system of nomenclature. Over time, the name continued to change as changes in the generic status of the parasite took place. In 1984, Eberhard and Orihel redefined the genus Mansonella and included the M. perstans species in it, so it is currently known as M. perstans. The adult worms of M. perstans were first recovered during post mortem examination of two aboriginal Indians in British Guiana from their mesentery and subpericardial fat. While an insect vector was hypothesized, it took many years of investigation before the true vector of M. perstans was discovered. Clinical presentation in humans While Mansonella infections are often asymptomatic, they can be associated with angioedema (similar to Calabar swellings of loaisis), recurrent pruritic subcutaneous lesions, fever, headaches, arthralgia, and neurologic manifestations.CDC \\"Filariasis. Life Cycle of Mansonella perstans\\" (2009). Eosinophilia, headache, fever, or abdominal pain may also be present. M. perstans may also present with a condition known as kampala, or Ugandan eye worm. This occurs when adult worms of M. perstans invade the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye. This condition was first attributed to M. perstans in Uganda, when six patients presented with nodules in the conjunctiva. The adult worms were identified as adult female M. perstans in five of these six cases. The symptoms of M. perstans may be confounded with those of other filarial infections, such as onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis and loiasis, because coinfection often occurs.f Case study A 36-year-old man was admitted to the outpatient clinic at the Goundi Missionary Hospital in the south of Chad in May 2001. He complained of visual impairment in the left eye, ocular and abdominal pruritus, and abdominal pain. He had previously been treated with DEC for M. perstans infection five months prior to his visit. A blood sample was taken at 11:00 am, and examined microscopically as a thick blood film stained with Giemsa's solution. The thick blood film revealed the presence of M. perstans, and no other parasites were found. He had 3% eosinophilia. A visual acuity test showed a reduction of visual acuity to 4/10 for the left eye, while the right eye was 9/10. However, no abnormalities were observed during examination of the anterior left eye chamber. Upon examination of the fundus of his left eye, a narrow, white, motionless, and linear lesion of 6‚Äì7 mm was found. He was then treated with a second course of DEC (400 mg daily in two doses for eight days, after a three- day dosage increase), and by the end of treatment, he did not have pruritus, but his visual impairment was unchanged. The M. perstans burden was significantly reduced, and the peripheral eosinohpil count decreased to 1%. He was then treated with mebendazole (100 mg twice a day, for 14 days), and at the end of his treatment, his visual impairment was the only symptom remaining. After a week, with no further treatment, his vision improved and acuity was increased to 8/10 in the left eye. While ocular symptoms occur quite frequently in symptomatic M. perstans infection, intraocular localization had not been described prior to this study. This case also is an example of the difficulty of treating mansonelliasis, and shows that combined drug regimens can be more effective than treatment using a single drug. Other relevant clinical information M. perstans might potentially interfere with the host's regulatory mechanisms and influence the outcome of other infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, which often thrive in similar environments. Recent research has also focused on coinfection of M. perstans and other filarial parasites. A study examining the epidemiology of Loa loa, Onchocerca volvulus, and M. perstans in the rain forest villages of Cameroon found a high prevalence of coinfection with O. voluvulus and M. perstans. It also found a low prevalence of L. loa and O. voluvulus coinfection, as well as low prevalence of L. loa and M. perstans coinfection. Coinfection also has significant implications for treatment, because efficacious drugs for M. perstans are different from those for most filarial infections. Another study evaluated the effectiveness of ivermectin and albendazole in M. perstans and Wuchereria bancrofti coinfection in a filarial endemic region of Mali, finding that M. perstans infection did not have a significant effect on the treatment of W. bancrofti. Other studies have evaluated the efficacy of other treatments on co-infection with other filarial parasites and M. perstans. Transmission M. perstans is transmitted by the bite of species of Culicoides midges. Only the female midges take blood meals, because the blood is needed for the maturation of eggs within the female. Reservoir Humans are the only known reservoir for M. perstans. No animal reservoirs for M. perstans occur as there are for Mansonella streptocerca. Vector Various species of Culicoides can be found worldwide, and in some areas, their high numbers make them a biting nuisance to humans and domestic animals. Culicoides species are stout flies with short vertical probosces and wings folded scissor-like over their abdomens at rest. They generally measure 1‚Äì4 mm in length. The wings of most species have a pattern of light and dark marks. While certain species of Culicoides, such as C. austeni and C. grahamii have been hypothesized to play a larger role than other species in the transmission of M. perstans, very few studies have attempted to identify the species of vectors of M. perstans in endemic areas. This issue is further complicated because the taxonomy of tropical Culicoides species is still uncertain. Biting midges progress from egg, to larva, pupa, and finally the adult stage. The complete cycle takes 2‚Äì6 wk, and is dependent on environmental conditions. The females usually bite around dawn and dusk, although often at other times. Eggs are laid 3‚Äì4 d after the blood meal, and about 70-180 eggs are laid each time. Moisture is essential for the vector, and the development of its eggs and larvae. Adults survive for a few weeks, and their flight range is limited to a few hundred meters from their larval habitats. Morphology Adults are white and thread-like, and have been found to be cylindrical in shape. Males are 35‚Äì56 mm long and 45‚Äì60 Œºm wide. Females are bigger, 70‚Äì80 mm long and 80‚Äì120 Œºm wide. The tail is half a coil in females and a full coil in males. Adult worms are rarely seen, but sometimes can be recovered from a laparotomy or autopsy.> Microfilariae of M. perstans are unsheathed, have blunt tails, and their nuclei extend to the end of the tail. The microfilariae have a length of 200 Œºm, and a width of 4.5 Œºm. They have the ability to elongate and contract, so they can vary in measurement and form. They are smaller than those of Loa loa, which have tapered tails and are frequently coiled. The microfilariae of M. perstans are smaller than those of W. bancrofti and the caudal end is blunt with a terminal nucleus. Lifecycle https://web.archive.org/web/20090115010310/http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/frames/a-f/filariasis/body_Filariasis_m_perstans.htm During a blood meal, an infected midge (Culicoides grahami and C. austeni) introduces third-stage (L3) filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound. Body heat likely activates the larvas and prompts them to leave the vector and actively penetrate the skin. The third-stage larvae develop into adults that live in body cavities, most commonly the pleural and peritoneal cavities. They also can live in mesentery, perirenal spaces, retroperitoneal spaces, or the pericardium, and mature into adults. Adults in the body cavities mate and produce unsheathed and subperiodic microfilariae that reach the bloodstream. The microfilariae can also be found in the cerebrospinal fluid. While the periodicity of these midges has been unclear, the most recent study suggests microfilariae indicate a weak but significant diurnal periodicity with a peak around 8 am. A midge ingests microfilariae during a blood meal. After ingestion, the microfilariae migrate from the midge's midgut through the hemocoel to the thoracic muscles of the midge. In the thoracic muscles, the microfilariae develop into second- stage larvae. They subsequently develop into third-stage larvae, which are infective. The third-stage larvae migrate to the midge's proboscis, where they can infect another human when the midge takes a blood meal. Diagnostic tests Similar to other filarial parasites, M. perstans is diagnosed by the identification of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Because the microfilariae are present in the peripheral blood in almost equal concentrations during day and night, blood samples can be obtained at any time (unlike other filarial microfilariae). The microfilariae are short and thin, unsheathed, and have rounded tails with nuclei at the extremity. The head spot sometimes has a V-shaped appearance. The blood sample can be a thick smear, stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. These include centrifugation of the blood sample lysed in 2% formalin (Knott's technique), or filtration through a Nucleopore¬Æ membrane. Serology is not very useful for diagnosis. Because the adult worms live mainly in pleural and peritoneal cavities, they are only rarely observed. At times, they can be observed during a laparotomy. M. perstans often occurs with other filarial infections, such as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. It should be distinguished from Microfilaria semiclarum (a parasite of animals which sometimes causes accidental infections in humans). Sometimes, confusion is possible if the blood smear is randomly infected during or after preparation with a mould such as Helicospora. This organism, however, is considerably smaller and thinner than a microfilaria. The DEC, or Mazzotti test, has been shown to have minor effects on microfilariae intensity, but it is not of practical use for diagnosis of mansonelliasis.  Management and treatment  M. perstans is one of the most difficult human filarial infections to treat. Effective treatment for mansonelliasis is lacking, with no consensus among the scientific community on the optimal approach. Numerous trials evaluating traditional antifilarial drugs such as ivermectin and DEC, as well as other benzimidazoles such as mebendazole, albendazole, levamisole, and thiabendazole, have been conducted. Recently, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of doxycycline to treat M. perstans infection have also been documented. Generally, DEC is ineffective in the treatment of M. perstans infection. Other drugs such as ivermectin and praziquantel have been tried, but are neither reliable nor rapidly effective. Mebendazole and thiabendazole have a greater effect than previously described drugs, but are not sufficient for treatment alone. Combination treatments with DEC and mebendazole have had the most success. In the most recent clinical trials, doxycycline has had success comparable to, if not better than, that of combination treatments. However, because it is a relatively recent discovery, the use of doxycycline is relatively limited to clinical trials. If the patient is asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. An analysis of the results of various clinical trials for each drug is illustrated below: = Diethylcarbamazine = While diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is the most common drug used to treat M. perstans infection, it is often ineffective, especially with the administration of only a single dose. In a 2005 study of 160 patients with symptomatic M. perstans infection in south Chad, DEC was administered in 200 mg. doses, twice daily for 21 days with a gradual dosage increase in the first three days. The single course of DEC lowered microfilarae in 80% of subjects, but did not eliminate the infection or related symptoms. A second course was therefore administered, and was successful in eliminating the microfilarial burden in most cases. No persistent effect of DEC on Microfilaria was noted on long-term follow up. These results accurately represent the general efficacy of DEC in treating M. perstans: two doses are necessary to eliminate the microfilarial burden temporarily, but no persistent effect of DEC on microfilariae was shown long-term. Furthermore, symptoms are usually not entirely alleviated by DEC. It has not been reported to cause adverse side effects in patients with M. perstans infection. = Ivermectin = While ivermectin is considered a first-line agent for the treatment of many filarial diseases (especially onchocerciasis), it has shown little or no efficacy against M. perstans at a dose of 200 Œºg/kg body weight or at a dose of 600 Œºg/kg body weight. A 2009 study in Uganda evaluated the effects of ivermectin, albendazole, and a combined regimen of both drugs on M. perstans infected individuals: Single doses of ivermectin alone had no marked effect on M. perstans microfilaraemias in the 12 months after treatments, with the counts remaining to pretreatment values. This is consistent with the findings of previous studies which have suggested ivermectin, when used alone, has little or no effect on M. perstans microfilaraemias. A reduction of microfilariae in patients has been noted, but it takes a long time to achieve (over 3 yr of administration of ivermectin), and is thus not useful in the short term for symptomatic patients. = Albendazole = Single doses of albendazole alone have been consistently reported to have little or no effect on M. perstans microfilaremias in 6 and 12 m after treatment, with counts of microfilaremias remaining close to pretreatment values. More recent studies have shown the drug to be more effective at high doses for prolonged periods of time. No side effects have been reported from recent studies. = Mebendazole = Mebendazole, another possible treatment for M. perstans filariasis, has been shown to be effective in significantly reducing microfilariae levels. It has been more effective than both ivermectin and DEC‚Äîwith a greater number of responders, a more significant reduction in microfilariae levels, and the ability to eliminate the infection more efficiently. =Thiabendazole = Thiabendazole has been shown to result in a small but significant decrease in microfilariae and in eosinophil count, and symptoms as treatment for symptomatic M. perstans infection. These markers were reduced even further following the administration of the second dose, showing that thiabendazole may be effective in M. perstans infection. In a recent comparative study, thiabendazole at a higher activity than single drug treatments such as ivermectin, DEC, and mebendazole, but lower activity than the combined regimen of mebendazole and DEC. However, more research may be needed into confirm the correct dosage and true effectiveness of thiabendazole in combating M. perstans infection. = Praziquantel = Praziquantel is effective against various helminthic and protozoan infections. The few studies about the use of praziquantel against M. perstans infection do not support its use for treatment of mansonelliasis. = Doxycycline = Doxycycline has been shown to decrease the development, embryogenesis, and fertility of worms in species that harbor the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia. Wolbachiae are bacterial endosymbionts of insects and many filarial nematodes, such as Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. The dependence of these parasites on their endosymbionts has led to the use of antibiotics directed against the wolbachiae, antibiotics that have been demonstrated to have a profound salutary effect on filarial infections. In 2009, Coulibaly et al. conducted an open-label randomized trial of doxycycline, an antibiotic, for Mansonella perstans infection. This resulted in a dramatic and sustained decrease in microfilarial levels: they decreased to 23% of pretreatment levels at 6 m after treatment and to 0% of pretreatment levels at 12 m after treatment. In addition, doxycycline has been shown to have macrofilaricidal activity, which is unique among the drugs for filariasis. However, in some areas, such as Gabon and Uganda, Wolbachia endosymbionts have not been detected in the microfilariae of M. perstans. This suggests some geographic isolates of M. perstans may have lost (or gained) the endosymbiont. This presents a controversial argument for the use of doxycycline as treatment of filarial infections. On one hand, doxycycline has been shown to be one of the only successful treatments for M. perstans, and could facilitate the eradication of filarial parasites. However, some scientists argue that the treatment of filariasis with doxycycline may select worms that will have already integrated Wolbachia genes into their genome, which could potentially have unforeseen consequences. Such lateral gene transfer has occurred in various geographic isolates of B. malayi, in which a fraction of the Wolbachia endosybmiont genome is integrated into the chromosome of its nematode host (the parasite). When this integration occurs, Wolbachia can no longer be targeted as means for treatment for filariasis. = Combination regimens = Combination treatments consisting of DEC plus mebendezole, or ivermectin and albendazole, have been shown to result in a highly significant fall in microfilariae. Other studies have challenged these findings, suggesting the combination treatment of ivermectin and albendazole does not significantly reduce microfilariae levels more than a single treatment regimen. Epidemiology M. perstans is found in tropical Africa, central and eastern South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The parasite is widespread in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Infections have been reported from 33 countries in this region. In certain locations, extremely high proportions of the inhabitants show signs of infection. It often occurs among poor populations living in rural villages. M. perstans is also found in the Americas in Venezuela, Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, northern Argentina and the Amazon basin. This parasite does not occur in Asia. It also does not occur in the most northern and southern regions of Africa. A recent review of M. perstans in Africa states that about 114 million people are infected with this parasite in Africa today. Public health and prevention strategies The ongoing large-scale programs for control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis have paid little attention to mansonelliasis. Despite the high prevalence of M. perstans in areas of tropical Africa, such as Uganda, the Congo, the Republic of Cameroon, and Gabon, no vector programs have been instituted for any of the mansonelliasis-causing parasites. Major reasons for this lack of attention are that M. perstans infections prevail in poor, rural populations and that infection with the parasite has not been linked with a clear and distinct medical picture. Much of the information regarding M. perstans has been obtained as a byproduct from studies of other filarial parasites. Mansonelliasis can thus be classified as one of the most neglected among the neglected tropical diseases. Culicoides midges are small enough to pass through screening or mosquito nets, so these would not be helpful. Protection of visitors to endemic areas can be achieved through the use of insect repellents.

The disease exists in Africa and tropical Americas, spread by biting midges or blackflies. It is usually asymptomatic. Symptoms Infections by Mansonella perstans, while often asymptomatic, can be associated with angioedema, pruritus, fever, headaches, arthralgias, and neurologic manifestations. Mansonella streptocerca can manifest on the skin via pruritus, papular eruptions and pigmentation changes. Mansonella ozzardi can cause symptoms that include arthralgias, headaches, fever, pulmonary symptoms, adenopathy, hepatomegaly, and pruritus. Eosinophilia is often prominent in all cases of Mansonelliasis. M. perstans can also present with Calabar-like swellings, hives, and a condition known as Kampala, or Ugandan eye worm. This occurs when adult M. perstans invades the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye. M. perstans can also present with hydrocele in South America. However, it is often hard to distinguish between the symptoms of Mansonelliasis and other nematode infections endemic to the same areas. Causes  Mansonelliasis is caused by nematodes (roundworms) in the Mansonella genus that reside in the skin or certain body cavities. The specific species are M. perstans, M. streptocerca and M. ozzardi. Vectors and life cycle  Life Cycles of Various Mansonella During a blood meal, an infected midge (genus Culicoides) or blackfly (genus Simulium) introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound. They develop into adults that reside in body cavities, most commonly the peritoneal cavity or pleural cavity, but also occasionally in the pericardium (M. perstans), subcutaneous tissue (M. ozzardi) or dermis (M. steptocerca). In M. perstans, size range for female worms is 70 to 80 mm long and 120 Œºm in diameter, and the males measure approximately 45 mm by 60 Œºm. In M. steptocerca, the females measure approximately 27 mm long. Their diameter is 50 Œºm at the level of the vulva (anteriorly) and ovaries (near the posterior end), and up to 85 Œºm at the mid- body. Males measure 50 Œºm in diameter. In M. ozzardi, adult worms are rarely found in humans. The size range for females worms is 65 to 81 mm long and 0.21 to 0.25 mm in diameter but unknown for males. Adult worms recovered from experimentally infected Patas monkeys measured 24 to 28 mm long and 70 to 80 Œºm in diameter (males) and 32 to 62 mm long and .130 to .160 mm in diameter (females). Adults produce unsheathed and non-periodic (sub-periodic in M. perstans) microfilariae that reach the blood stream. A midge or black fly ingests microfilariae during a blood meal. After ingestion, the microfilariae migrate from the midgut through the hemocoel to the thoracic muscles of the arthropod. There the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae and later into third-stage infective larvae. The third-stage infective larvae migrate to the arthropod‚Äôs proboscis where they can then infect another human when the midge or blackfly takes a blood meal. Asymptomatic humans serve as a significant reservoir for the disease. Little is known about other reservoirs of the disease. Pathogenesis  Mansonelliasis infection has been considered a minor filariasis, remaining asymptomatic in most infected subjects. Larvae develop in the subject and migrate to their respective regions in the skin or body cavities. It is likely that aside from being caused by the worm itself, some of the pathological changes observed are induced by the immune response to the infection leading to some of the various symptoms mentioned above. However, Mansonelliasis is little studied compared to other forms of filariasis so there is not as much information known regarding its specific pathogenesis. Diagnosis  Examination of blood samples will allow identification of microfilariae of M. perstans, and M. ozzardi based. This diagnosis can be made on the basis of the morphology of the nuclei distribution in the tails of the microfilariae. The blood sample can be a thick smear, stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. These include centrifugation of the blood sample lyzed in 2% formalin (Knott's technique), or filtration through a Nucleopore membrane. Examination of skin snips will identify microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus and M. streptocerca. Skin snips can be obtained using a corneal-scleral punch, or more simply a scalpel and needle. It is important that the sample be allowed to incubate for 30 minutes to 2 hours in saline or culture medium and then examined. This allows for the microfilariae that would have been in the tissue to migrate to the liquid phase of the specimen. Additionally, to differentiate the skin-dwelling filariae M. streptocerca and Onchocerca volvulus, a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed using small amounts of parasite material present in skin biopsies. Prevention  Prevention can be partially achieved through limiting contact with vectors through the use of DEET and other repellents, but due to the predominantly relatively mild symptoms and the infection being generally asymptomatic, little has formally been done to control the disease. Treatment  There is no consensus on optimal therapeutic approach. The most commonly used drug is diethylcarbamazine (DEC), but it is, however, often ineffective. Although other drugs have been tried such as praziquantel, ivermectin, and albendozole, none has proven to be reliably and rapidly effective. Mebendazole appeared more active than DEC in eliminating the infection, and had comparable overall responses. Thiabendazole evidenced a small, but significant activity against the infection. A combination of treatments, DEC plus mebendazole, was much more effective than single drug doses. Epidemiology  Areas where Mansonelliasis is endemic Mansonelliasis is found in Latin America from the Yucat√°n peninsula to northern Argentina, in the Caribbean, and in Africa from Senegal to Kenya and south to Angola and Zimbabwe. M. ozzardi is found only in the New World, M. steptocerca is found only in the Congo basin, and M. perstans is found in both the previously described areas of Africa and Latin America. Prevalence rates vary from a few percent to as much as 90% in areas like Trinidad, Guyana and Colombia. Infection is more common and has a higher microfilarial dose with age, though studies have found microfilarial dose not to be correlated with symptoms. In parts of rural South America, men have been found more susceptible than women, possibly due to more outdoors work by males as children, and possibly due to cooking fires serving as deterrents to vectors for women who perform more domestic duties. One study in central Africa found M. perstans to be a much more common cause of filariasis symptoms compared to Loa loa and Wuchereria bancrofti. Since most Mansonelliasis is asymptomatic, it has been considered a relatively minor filarial disease, and has a very low, if any, mortality, though there is little data on which to base estimates.  History  Mansonelliasis, in the form of M. ozzardi, was first documented in 1897.

He wrote both sacred and secular vocal music, and had his music published in Paris and Lyons. His most famous work was the chanson Je suis desh√©rit√©e, which many later composers, including Lassus and Palestrina, used as a basis for parody masses. Life He was most likely from the small town of Cad√©ac, in the southern part of Gascony near the Pyrenees, as suggested by his name. All that is known about his life is that he was choirmaster in Auch, the historical capital of the region, in 1556, as mentioned on the title page of Du Chemin's publication of his Missa Alma Redemptoris Mater. A poem by Bernard du Poey, published in 1551, also mentions him as being resident in Auch, but does not give his employment or any other details.Bernstein, Grove online In 1538 Jacques Moderne published some of his chansons in Lyons; this is the earliest date of activity known for Cad√©ac, but his location or employment at that time are not known. Music and influence Cad√©ac wrote music in most of the vocal forms of the time and place, including secular chansons, motets, mass settings, Magnificats, and one isolated setting of the Credo (part of the mass). A total of 11 chansons, 24 motets, eight settings of the mass, and four of the Magnificat survive. His chansons seem to be his earliest work, and he turned to sacred music later in his career. Pierre Attaingnant (in Paris) and Jacques Moderne (in Lyons) published most of his chansons between 1538 and 1541. One of them became extraordinarily famous: Je suis desh√©rit√©e was widely distributed, and composers as diverse as Jean Maillard in France, Nicolas Gombert in the Habsburg chapel and the Low Countries, Orlande de Lassus in Bavaria, and Palestrina in Italy all used it as source material for masses later in the century.Nugent, Grove online The distribution of his motets was also extraordinary, with copies found in places as remote from their Gascon origin as Madrid, Strasbourg, Nuremberg, Venice, and Krak√≥w, Poland. According to Grove, a version of his chanson Je suis desh√©rit√©e has been found in England, fitted with English words (\\"Oure Father, God Celestiall\\"), though in fact the words are in the distinct Scots language, not English. (It is a translation of the Lord's Prayer, though the original is not so reverent: \\"I'm broke. Go tell my friend\\" is the gist of the opening stanza.) Cad√©ac's musical style originated from the homophony and simplicity prevalent in the 1530s, especially in the Parisian chanson at the time of Cl√©ment Janequin, with clear diction, short phrases, general avoidance of dense polyphony, and abundant parallel imperfect intervals. He used these same simple textures in his sacred music, textures which contrasted considerably with the dense counterpoint being written by the Netherlanders of his generation (composers such as Nicolas Gombert). Most of his motets appeared in 1555, in a publication by Le Roy & Ballard, Petri Cadeac musici excellentissima moteta. The 18 pieces in this set are for from four to six voices. This publication was the biggest single print of his music of the time. References * Howard Mayer Brown: \\"Chanson, 4.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie. 20 vol.

The name is derived from Greek ancylos Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œçŒªŒøœÇ \\"crooked, bent\\" and stoma œÉœÑœåŒºŒ± \\"mouth\\". Ancylostomiasis is also known as miner's anaemia, tunnel disease, brickmaker's anaemia and Egyptian chlorosis. Helminthiasis may also refer to ancylostomiasis, but this term also refers to all other parasitic worm diseases as well. In the United Kingdom, if acquired in the context of working in a mine, the condition is eligible for Industrial Injuries Disability Benefit. It is a prescribed disease (B4) under the relevant legislation.¬ß Ancylostomiasis is caused when hookworms, present in large numbers, produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host's intestinal walls. Signs and symptoms Depending on the organism, the signs and symptoms vary. Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus can enter the blood stream while Ancylostoma braziliensis cannot. Signs and symptoms of Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are given in corresponding page. In Ancylostoma braziliensis as the larvae are in an abnormal host, they do not mature to adults but instead migrate through the skin until killed by the host's inflammatory response. This migration causes local intense itching and a red serpiginous lesion. Treatment with a single dose of oral ivermectin results in cure rates of 94‚Äì100%. Causes The infection is usually contracted by people walking barefoot over contaminated soil. In penetrating the skin, the larvae may cause an allergic reaction. It is due to the itchy patch at the site of entry that the early infection gets its nickname \\"ground itch\\". Once larvae have broken through the skin, they enter the bloodstream and are carried to the lungs (however, unlike ascarids, hookworms do not usually cause pneumonia). The larvae migrate from the lungs up the windpipe to be swallowed and carried back down to the intestine. If humans come into contact with larvae of the dog hookworm or the cat hookworm, or of certain other hookworms that do not infect humans, the larvae may penetrate the skin. Sometimes, the larvae are unable to complete their migratory cycle in humans. Instead, the larvae migrate just below the skin producing snake-like markings. This is referred to as a creeping eruption or cutaneous larva migrans. Diagnosis They commonly infect the skin, eyes, and viscera in humans. * Ancylostoma brasiliensis causes cutaneous larva migrans. * Toxocara causes visceral larva migrans. Prevention Control of this parasite should be directed against reducing the level of environmental contamination. Treatment of heavily infected individuals is one way to reduce the source of contamination (one study has estimated that 60% of the total worm burden resides in less than 10% of the population). Other obvious methods are to improve access to sanitation, e.g. toilets, but also convincing people to maintaining them in a clean, functional state, thereby making them conducive to use. Treatment The drug of choice for the treatment of hookworm disease is mebendazole which is effective against both species, and in addition, will remove the intestinal worm Ascaris also, if present. The drug is very efficient, requiring only a single dose and is inexpensive. However, treatment requires more than giving the anthelmintic, the patient should also receive dietary supplements to improve their general level of health, in particular iron supplementation is very important. Iron is an important constituent of a multitude of enzyme systems involved in energy metabolism, DNA synthesis and drug detoxification. An infection of N. americanus parasites can be treated by using benzimidazoles, albendazole, and mebendazole. A blood transfusion may be necessary in severe cases of anemia. Light infections are usually left untreated in areas where reinfection is common. Iron supplements and a diet high in protein will speed the recovery process. In a case study involving 56‚Äì60 men with Trichuris trichiura and/or N. americanus infections, both albendazole and mebendazole were 90% effective in curing T. trichiura. However, albendazole had a 95% cure rate for N. americanus, while mebendazole only had a 21% cure rate. This suggests albendazole is most effective for treating both T. trichiura and N. americanus.  Epidemiology  An epidemic of \\"miner's anaemia\\" caused by Ancylostoma duodenale among workers constructing the Gotthard Tunnel contributed to the understanding of ancylostomiasis. Hookworm anaemia was first described by Wilhelm Griesenger in Egypt, Cairo in 1852. He found thousands of adult ancylostomes in the small bowel of a 20-year old soldier who was suffering from severe diarrhoea and anaemia (labelled at the time as Egyptian chlorosis). The subject was revisited in Europe when there was an outbreak of \\"miner's anaemia\\" in Italy. During the construction of the Gotthard Tunnel in Switzerland (1871‚Äì81), a large number of miners suffered from severe anaemia of unknown cause. Medical investigations let to the understanding that it was caused by Ancylostoma duodenale (favoured by high temperatures and humidity) and to \\"major advances in parasitology, by way of research into the aetiology, epidemiology and treatment of ancylostomiasis\\". Hookworms still account for high proportion of debilitating disease in the tropics and 50‚Äì60,000 deaths per year can be attributed to this disease.

as Necator americanus. This hookworm infection is a type of helminthiasis (infection) which is a type of neglected tropical disease. Signs and symptoms When adult worms attach to the villi of the small intestine, they suck on the host's blood, which may cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, cramps, and weight loss that can lead to anorexia. Heavy infections can lead to the development of iron deficiency and hypochromic microcytic anemia. This form of anemia in children can give rise to physical and mental retardation. Infection caused by cutaneous larvae migrans, a skin disease in humans, is characterized by skin ruptures and severe itching.  Cause  Lifecycle of a hookworm Cutaneous larvae migrans Necatoriasis is caused by N. americanus. N. americanus can be divided into two areas ‚Äì larvae and adult stage. The third stage larvae are guided to human skin by following thermal gradients. Typically, the larvae enter through the hands and feet following contact with contaminated soil. A papular, pruritic, itchy rash will develop around the site of entry into the human host. This is also known as \\"ground itch\\". Generally, migration through the lungs is asymptomatic but a mild cough and pharyngeal irritation may occur during larval migration in the airways. Once larvae break through the alveoli and are swallowed, they enter the gastrointestinal tract and attach to the intestinal mucosa where they mature into adult worms. The hookworms attach to the mucosal lining using their cutting plates which allows them to penetrate blood vessels and feed on the host's blood supply. Each worm consumes 30Œºl of blood per day. The major issue results from this intestinal blood loss which can lead to iron-deficiency anemia in moderate to heavy infections. Other common symptoms include epigastric pain and tenderness, nausea, exertional dyspnea, pain in lower extremities and in joints, sternal pain, headache, fatigue, and impotence. Death is rare in humans. Diagnosis The standard method for diagnosing necatoriasis is through identification of N. americanus eggs in a fecal sample using a microscope. Eggs can be difficult to visualize in a lightly infected sample so a concentration method is generally used such as flotation or sedimentation. However, the eggs of A. duodenale and N. americanus cannot be distinguished; thus, the larvae must be examined to identify these hookworms. Larvae cannot be found in stool specimens unless the specimen was left at ambient temperature for a day or more. The most common technique used to diagnose a hookworm infection is to take a stool sample, fix it in 10% formalin, concentrate it using the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique, and then create a wet mount of the sediment for viewing under a microscope. Prevention Education, improved sanitation, and controlled disposal of human feces are critical for prevention. Nonetheless, wearing shoes in endemic areas helps reduce the prevalence of infection. Treatment An infection of N. americanus parasites can be treated by using benzimidazoles: albendazole or mebendazole. A blood transfusion may be necessary in severe cases of anemia. Light infections are usually left untreated in areas where reinfection is common. Iron supplements and a diet high in protein will speed the recovery process. In a case study involving 56-60 men with Trichuris trichiura and/or N. americanus infections, both albendazole and mebendazole were 90% effective in curing T. trichiura. However, albendazole had a 95% cure rate for N. americanus, while mebendazole only had a 21% cure rate. This suggests albendazole is most effective for treating both T. trichiura and N. americanus. Cryotherapy by application of liquid nitrogen to the skin has been used to kill cutaneous larvae migrans, but the procedure has a low cure rate and a high incidence of pain and severe skin damage, so it now is passed over in favor of suitable pharmaceuticals. Topical application of some pharmaceuticals has merit, but requires repeated, persistent applications and is less effective than some systemic treatments. Epidemiology Necator americanus was first discovered in Brazil and then was found in Texas. Later, it was found to be indigenous in Africa, China, southwest Pacific islands, India, and Southeast Asia. This parasite is a tropical parasite and is the most common species in humans. Roughly 95% of hookworms found in the southern region of the United States are N. americanus. This parasite is found in humans, but can also be found in pigs and dogs. Transmission of N. americanus infection requires the deposition of egg- containing feces on shady, well-drained soil and is favored by warm, humid (tropical) conditions. Therefore, infections worldwide are usually reported in places where direct contact with contaminated soil occurs.

Education  Dumpit graduated from Maryknoll College (now Miriam College) with a Bachelor of Arts degree major in Mass Communication. She also holds a master's degree in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines where she was a scholar and consistent Dean's Lister. She is also a Lopez Jaena fellow from the University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication. In 2005, she took up the Command and General Staff Course CL46 at the AFP Command and General Staff College successfully completing the prescribed program on March 20, 2006 whose batch included Education Secretary Jesli Lapus among others. The CGSC is an Executive Leadership Program and in fact, is a prerequisite for promotion for military officials to the rank of General.  Career  Dumpit was in broadcast media for more than 20 years. She started her career as editorial assistant at the government station MBS (now PTV). In 1987, Dumpit moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she anchored The Philippine Reports, a weekly news show broadcast in the Midwest. She resumed her broadcasting career in PTV upon returning to the Philippines in 1992. In October 1995, Dumpit was hired by the Associated Broadcasting Company to lead its news team as anchor of Balitang Balita, an early evening newscast and two years later, she became the anchor of the late night newscast The Big News replacing Tina Monzon-Palma as the lead anchor due to her transfer to ABS- CBN's The World Tonight after Loren Legarda decided to leave the newscast when she ran and won as senator in the 1998 elections. Palma took Legarda's chair. After four years as its senior news anchor, Dumpit negotiated for a change in the terms and conditions of her work status and when her contract was not renewed in October 1999, she sent a letter to Jose Javier, Vice President for News and Public Affairs of ABC, stating that she considered this a constructive dismissal of her services. On December 20, 1999 Dumpit filed a complaint against the company for illegal constructive dismissal and demanded payment for alleged damages. After the initial dismissal of the complaint by the Labor Arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the decision and ruled in favor of reinstatement and payment of 2.6 million pesos for back wages. Following the NLRC appeal, ABC filed a petition to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court ruled on January 30, 2004 that NLRC committed a grave abuse of indiscretion and reversed the NLRC's ruling. After almost eight years, on June 8, 2007 the appellate court decision and the subsequent resolution denying the motion for reconsideration were reversed and set aside by a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The Supreme Court affirmed NLRC's decision that Dumpit was a regular employee of ABC and that the company's actions constituted illegal dismissal. The decision ruled that Dumpit was to be reinstated to her position as ABC 5 news anchor without lost to seniority and to be awarded almost three million pesos to cover backwages and benefits due a regular employee and for moral damages. Dumpit has also hosted several radio programs over DZXL, Radio Veritas and DWIZ, contributed news articles to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Philippine Star and wrote a column for the opinion page of The Manila Times. She continues to be a broadcast correspondent of radio station DWIZ. Just recently, she resumed her column at the Manila Times which appears every Thursday at the op-ed page. Dumpit served as a Barangay council member from 1997 to 2004. In 2007 she ran but lost in the mayoral election for Rosario, La Union. Dumpit expressed concern over possible election fraud and consequently, filed an electoral protest. She announced on July 11, 2007 that she was looking for a handwriting expert to analyze the ballots in order to determine the true results of the elections. The protest is still pending at Branch 32 of the RTC Agoo, La Union. Currently, she holds the position Deputy Executive Director of CITEM (Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions), an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. She was appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2008 for her expertise in communications and marketing and reappointed by President Benigno Aquino III as Director IV of the Department of Trade and Industry, a promotion from her previous rank. Her CESO rank is in process after hurdling a battery of written and oral tests where she passed with flying colors.

They are chiefly descendants of about 30,000 immigrants who arrived between 1846‚Äì1914, most following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.Los colonosAlemanes en Chile. Colonizaci√≥n Alemana en Llanquihue From the middle of the 19th century to the present, they have played a significant role in the economic, political and cultural development of the Chilean nation. The 19th- century immigrants settled chiefly in Chile‚Äôs Araucan√≠a, Los R√≠os and Los Lagos regions in the so-called Zona Sur of Chile, including the Chilean lake district.  History  = Germans in the Spanish colony = Incursions and settlements of the Conquistadores The first German to feature in the history of what is now Chile is Bartolom√© Blumenthal (Spanish alias Bartolom√© Flores) during the 16th century who accompanied Pedro de Valdivia. The latter conquistador ousted the indigenous population and founded the city of Santiago. Valdivia also arrested and took hostage the Cacique (tribal leaders and chiefs) to weaken the society of the local Mapuche people. Blumenthal took part in the defence of the Spanish settlement of Santiago when the Mapuche launched a counter-offensive on 11 September 1541 in attempt to free their caciques held hostage by the conquistadores. Later Blumenthal took part in the consolidation of the Spanish settlement that would become the Talagante Province; he was the first engineer in the remote colony. Blumenthal‚Äôs son-in- law, Pedro Lisperguer (born Peter Lisperger in Worms, Germany), was appointed as mayor of Santiago in 1572. Johann von Bohon (known in Spanish as Juan Boh√≥n) was also part of Valdivia's expedition and was ordered to establish the city of La Serena in 1544. = Hamburg and Valpara√≠so = Valpara√≠so, Chile, in 1830 In 1818 Chile became independent from Spain and began to engage in trading with more nations. The port city of Valpara√≠so became a major center for trade with Hamburg, with commercial travellers and merchants from Germany staying for lengthy periods of time to work in Valpara√≠so. Some settled there permanently. On 9 May 1838 Club Alem√°n de Valpara√≠so, the first German cultural organization was established in the city. German residents and visitors held cultural functions here. The club began to organize literary, musical and theatre productions, contributing to the cultural life of the city. Aquinas Ried, a physician, became widely known in the city for composing operas, and for writing poetry and plays. The club had its own orchestras and academic choir (singakademie) which would perform works composed by local musicians.Or√≠genes del Club Alem√°n y Primer Centro Cultural del Antiguo Valpara√≠so During World War I, the German Club of Valparaiso welcomed Admiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy after they fought the Battle of Coronel off the Chilean coast. =Colonization of Southern Chile= The Chilean government encouraged German immigration in 1848, a time of revolution in Germany. Before that Bernhard Eunom Philippi recruited nine working families to emigrate from Hesse to Chile. The origin of the German immigrants in Chile began with the Law of Selective Immigration of 1845. The objective of this law was to bring people of a medium social/high cultural level to colonize the southern regions of Chile; these were between Valdivia and Puerto Montt. The process was administered by Vicente P√©rez Rosales by mandate of the then-president Manuel Montt. The German immigrants revived the domestic economy, and they changed the southern zones. The leader of the first colonists, Karl Anwandter, proclaimed their goals: The expansion and economic development of Valdivia were limited in the early 19th century. To stimulate economic development, the Chilean government initiated a highly focused immigration program under Vicente P√©rez Rosales as government representative. Through this program, thousands of Germans settled in the area, incorporating then-modern technology and know-how to develop agriculture and industry. Some of the new immigrants stayed in Valdivia but others were given forested land, which they cleared for farms.Luis Otero, La Huella del Fuego: Historia de los bosques y cambios en el paisaje del sur de Chile (Valdivia, Editorial Pehuen) For ten years after the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, numerous liberal immigrants came from Germany, exiles of the revolutions. They settled primarily in the Llanquihue in the towns of Frutillar, Puerto Octay, Puerto Varas, Osorno and Puerto Montt. Around 1900 Valdivia prospered with industries, including the Hoffmann Gristmill and the Rudloff shoe factory. = 20th century = By the mid-1930s, most of the farming land around the towns of Valdivia and Osorno had been claimed. Some German immigrants moved further south to places such as Puyuhuapi in the Ays√©n region. German settlers in Ays√©n Region in the 1930s. Subsequently, a new wave of German immigrants arrived in Chile, with many settling in Temuco, and Santiago. Many founded businesses; for example, Horst Paulmann's small store in the capital of the Araucan√≠a Region grew into Cencosud, one of the largest businesses in the region. German settlers in Ays√©n Region in 1951. Even before the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933, a German Chilean youth organization was established with strong Nazi influence. Nazi Germany pursued a policy of Nazification of the German Chilean community. These communities and their organizations were considered a cornerstone to extend the Nazi ideology across the world by Nazi Germany. Most German Chileans were passive supporters of Nazi Germany. Nazism was widespread among the German Lutheran Church hierarchy in Chile. A local chapter of the Nazi Party was started in Chile. During World War II, many German Jews fled to Chile before and during the Holocaust. For example, the families of Mario Kreutzberger and Tom√°s Hirsch came to Chile during this time. Shortly after World War II, former members of Nazi Germany tried to take refuge in South America, including Chile, fleeing trials against them in Europe and elsewhere. Among these was SS Standartenf√ºhrer and war criminal Walter Rauff. Paul Sch√§fer, a former army medic, founded Colonia Dignidad, a German enclave in the Maule Region, in which abuses against human rights were allegedly carried out. The precise number of Nazi refugees hidden in Chile after WWII remains unknown.  German Chileans today  Raw beef crudos are considered a typical German-Chilean dish similar to the German mett. The one in picture are from Caf√© Hausmann in Valdivia. Entrance to the Kunstmann Brewery and restaurant in Valdivia, Chile German Lutheran church in Frutillar, Chile The exact number German-Chileans is unknown because many of the early arrivals' descendants have intermarried and assimilated over the past 150 years. According to the last census, there were 8,000 German-citizens living in Chile. An independent estimate calculates that about 500,000 Chileans could be descendants of German immigrants. An estimated 20,000 Chileans speak the German language.

Moore (born 1955) is a retired American journalist who was editor of The Denver Post from 2002 to 2016. Previously, he was managing editor of The Boston Globe. Career A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Moore is a 1976 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University where he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism and political science and where, as of 2016, he still served as a trustee. Moore began his 40-year journalism career in 1976 at the Journal- Herald in Dayton, Ohio; he was a reporter covering crime, education, politics and government. He spent six years at The Plain Dealer, where he began his editing career, first as state political editor in 1982 and later as day city editor.

Both sides signed a truce as part of the protocol on November 15, 1994, and the treaty was signed on November 20, 1994.Vines, Alex. Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process, 1999. Human Rights Watch.New York Times November 1, November 16, November 21 1994 Negotiation By late 1993 UNITA could operate and conduct raids in over 70% of Angola, but the government's military successes in 1994 forced UNITA to sue for peace. By November 1994 the government had taken control of 60% of the country. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi called the situation UNITA's \\"deepest crisis\\" since its creation. Savimbi, unwilling to personally sign the accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola sign in his place and President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos responded by having Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura represent the MPLA. According to Manuvakola, Savimbi wanted him to act as a scapegoat.Rothchild, Donald S. Managing Ethnic Conflict in Africa: Pressures and Incentives for Cooperation, 1997. pp. 137‚Äì138. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on November 15, 1994 in a symbolic move to boost support for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said they would be willing to meet with Savimbi; Mandela invited Savimbi to come to South Africa, but he did not go in fear of being arrested for war crimes. Treaty terms Under the agreement the government and UNITA would ceasefire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan National police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement which granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the protocol's collapse and the civil war. The Bicesse Accords largely punished the weaker signatory while the Lusaka Protocol guaranteed UNITA's hold over important governorships. Implementation United Nations Angola Verification Mission III and MONUA spent $1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the protocol. The UN largely did not enforce the provision prohibiting UNITA from buying foreign arms and both sides continued to build up their stockpile. The United Nations Security Council did not authorize a significant peacekeeping force in the area until 1995 and delayed full deployment until late 1996. U.N. Special Representative Blondin Beye covered up human rights violations because, as a UN official told Human Rights Watch in 1995, \\"the situation is too sensitive for serious human rights monitoring. Making public what we know could undermine the peace process and put us back to war.\\" In May 1998 Beye changed his mind and the UN began reporting abuses. Three months after the government signed the treaty, in February 1995 Chief of Staff General Jo√£o de Matos complained that peace would only be achieved when the government defeated UNITA militarily, calling the protocol a \\"mistake.\\" By December 1998, the government and UNITA were again in a state of war. The UN's Human Rights Division did not publish any reports from January to July 1999 because fighting prevented them from investigating. Following the protocol the government and UNITA both engaged in the indiscriminate killing of civilians, torture, and other human rights violations. Not only did UNITA not demobilize but it purchased a large amount of weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in Albania and Bulgaria, and from Zaire, South Africa, Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Togo, and Burkina Faso. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave US$250 million to UNITA between 1986 and 1991, UNITA made $1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, and South Africa. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required. In March 1995 UNITA militants shot and destroyed an UNAVEM III helicopter in Quibaxe. Military leaders met on January 10, 1995 and in February in Waku Kungo to make sure both sides continued to observe the ceasefire. Savimbi and dos Santos met four times after the helicopter downing; in Lusaka on May 6, in Gabon in August, in Brussels, Belgium in September, and in March 1996 in Libreville, Gabon. Between the first and second meetings dos Santos offered Savimbi the position of Vice President, but Savimbi turned him down in August 1996 during the party's Third Congress. Executive Outcomes, a private military company, had 400‚Äì500 mercenaries in Angola fighting on behalf of the Angolan government until January 1996 in violation of the protocol's repatriation provision. Savimbi and dos Santos spoke on the phone in December 1997 and reached an agreement on January 9, 1998 to implement the protocol, but fighting resumed and the peace process ended.

Upon completion, Kurohime destroyed the tower and entered the realm of the gods to slaughter them, as they were the ones who started the war in the first place. Through a combination of deception and brutality, the gods captured her and then split Kurohime into two beings, one representing her rage, and the other representing her compassion. The being representing her rage, in a form of a small girl named 'Himeko', seeks to regain her body and powers, and attempt to take down the gods again; however the curse can only be undone with love. Throughout the course of the manga, Kurohime is able to regain her ability to love through her relationship with Zero, causing her to evolve into different incarnations throughout the various story arcs. Magic Magic is manipulated by gifted humans who are attuned to magic, called witches (whether they be men or women).

One can perform miracles or summon great creatures and manipulate the shape, form and wellbeing of others through magic. It seems all witches are also gunslingers and how effective their magic powers are depends on their ability to create powerful \\"magical\\" bullets. A witch must channel her powers into the bullet through a casting duration that imbues her bullets with various magical powers, each having different function, such as summoning powerful beasts to aid in the caster's combat, to heal wounds, manipulate one's shape, and even to bring the dead back to life. The strength of these bullets depends on the ritual as well as the ability of the caster himself/herself. Other magical elements include land deities, such as a mountain god, or the god of death. Other supernatural being exist, such as Shinigami Angels, or Reaper Angels, and demons, who possess astounding magical and destructive powers. Most of these supernatural beings look down on humans as nothing more than pawns in their games, and see none to little value in the lives of those who cross their paths. Also, resurrection is saved for the gods alone, and any human who tried that (unless assisted by the spirits) would face divine punishment, as well as the resurrected soul torn to pieces. Characters =Protagonists= ; : Kurohime is the most powerful witch- gunslinger in the world; capable of amazing feats such as the ability to summon and control a wide variety of dragons. Ten years ago, she challenged the gods and failed, and was split into two beings as punishment, one representing her rage, and the other representing her compassion. The form representing her rage, appearing as a child named 'Himeko', seeks to regain her appearance and powers, which can only be done through the power of love. This becomes difficult as Kurohime has become cruel and vain, responding to feelings from most men by using them to further her own goals. : is Kurohime's child like form, apparently between the ages of 8 and 10. With her ability to feel love stripped following her split at the gods' hands, Shirohime forced Kurohime into a more harmless form under the condition that she can only change back when she feels love. Greedy and self-centered, Himeko also lacks the power of Kurohime and originally considers Zero to be her \\"lap-dog.\\" After spending time with Zero however, Himeko slowly began to regain the ability to love and feel compassion, allowing her to randomly regain the form of Kurohime for a few brief moments and then permanently during the battle with Darkray. : is Kurohime's second alternate form, between the ages of 13 and 15. With Shirohime slain by Dark Rei, the original curse on Kurohime was broken. Unfortunately, the trauma of losing Zero resulted in Kurohime unable to access her full powers and limiting the recovery of her proper form. Informed by Yamatohime that reviving Zero will enable her to fully regain her power and form, Kurohime received a magical Lotus which when plucked, will cause her to briefly transform at the cost of losing a memory of Zero. She also receives a sword blade called Yamato-Dachi, which once empowered with the magic of the four spirit kings will be able to resurrect Zero. Upon reception, Yamoto-Dachi promptly fuses with Senryu, changing it into Yamato Senryu which can assume the form of either a gun or a katana. Kurohime was then launched from Yamatohime's prison inside of a giant peach which was found by an old couple, who upon finding her inside gave her the name Momohime (peach princess), a name which Kurohime finds exceedingly annoying. As Momohime, Kurohime's magic is slightly stronger than Himeko but still heavily inferior to that of her true form. She also is a bit more mature than Himeko, willingly repaying kindness and helping those in need, but still has quite a temper to those who irritate her. : is Kurohime's third alternate form. After having most of her memories of Zero stripped away from her by Dark Zero, Kurohime reverts to an age between 16 and 18. In this form, the majority of Kurohime's powers have been restored, allowing her to fight her enemies on a more or less equal level without sacrificing her final two memories of Zero. Sent back in time by Kairyu to learn the truth about Zero's past, Kurohime adopted a third alias to prevent Zero from learning her identity and thereby altering the past. As Himekojo, Kurohime is slightly more \\"girly\\" than her other incarnations (her first thought upon arriving in the past is how cute the child version of Zero must be) but is also prone to vanity, taking furious offense at Ray's comments about her being ugly. Upon learning that the Zero she fell in love with is in fact Ray, Himekojo's love for him grew even stronger, and is intend to save Ray from the darkness in the present, as she failed to do so in the past. She still refers him as \\"Zero\\", despite knowing his true name. After a brutal fight with Ray, Kurohime allows herself to be consumed by the River of Death, apparently dying in the process, but also finally succeeding in returning Ray to his human form. However, it is shown that the Kurohime's soul was absorbed by the black tree which emerges from the River of Death. Yamato-hime then sacrifices herself to imbue the tree with her remaining energy, transforming the black tree into a white tree and Kurohime is reborn. She uses the ultimate blade to kill Yashahime and is reunited with Ray. It is revealed that she has the power to create a new world and that the white tree contains most of the souls of those who died. Using the white trees power to travel into space, Kurohime embraces Ray and says that one day, even if it takes an eternity, they will find a new world and be reborn so that they can start over. Four billion years later, on an Earth-like world, Kurohime, reincarnated as a male gunslinger saves Ray's life, revealed to have been reincarnated as a young woman. : is Kurohime's other half who was split into two persona by Sword. While Kurohime was banished back to earth, Shirohime became the Goddess of Benevolence. Unlike the other \\"younger\\" incarnations of Kurohime, Shirohime is calm and collected, even to death. She was killed by Darkray when defending her other half. ; : Zero is a young boy saved by Kurohime in his childhood. Over ten years, he trained and became a gunslinger. He uses four guns and is known for his incredible speed. He is very loyal to Kurohime, and although he finds her difficult to handle as a child, he is still very much in love with her. Kurohime often berates him for his naivety and open kindness, but it is also what she fell in love with. His personal morals and sense of justice stems from his past: after witnessing Kurohime's power when she saved him, he vowed only to use his guns to protect and save the innocent. In order not to kill anyone, he aims mostly to disarm his aggressors with his shots. Throughout the story, he suffers great - and almost fatal - physical damage in order to save his beloved Kurohime, despite her often insensitive and ungrateful behavior. His love for Kurohime was so strong that he willingly sacrificed his own life to save her from the River of Death. : Near the end of the time traveling arc it is revealed that the true Zero was killed after a situation forced Zero to resurrect. His soul was destroyed by the Shinigami Angels and that in reality the Zero Kurohime knows is actually Zero's brother Ray posing as Zero in penance. : Zero's soul is taken to the underworld by Yashahime and there he is resurrected as the new God of Death. The two later confront Kurohime at the prison of the Spirit King Byako and attack her, even though she isn't willing to fight him. After taking back his signature blue scarf from Kurohime, he tears out most of the petals that comprise her soul lotus, leaving one behind. This single lotus petal contains the memories of the love Kurohime has for Zero, and the pain of losing him. This act causes Zero to remember his true memories and he transforms into his full Death God form. It is revealed that Zero holds much darkness in his heart, as the \\"Good Zero\\" is told to be just \\"an image created by an idealistic youth\\". Zero continues the fight but later retreats with Yashahime after she was severely injured by Kurohime. While Kurohime was gone into Zero's past, Dark Zero declared that he would wipe out humanity, and would ask the Supreme God, Igudo, to commence with the apocalypse. ; : Despite being so small, Ray is actually Zero's older twin brother, a quiet young boy that keeps to himself. After seeing his mother murdered by Doc, he loses the will to speak, as well as stopped growing, and follows Doc around looking for a chance to kill him. He will not allow anyone else to kill Doc but himself, therefore protecting him from other attempts at his life. Unlike his younger brother Zero, or his later persona of Zero, the original Ray is rude and somewhat violent, calling Kurohime a \\"hag\\" and assaulting her when he considered her annoying. ; : The original Zero was the younger twin brother of Ray. As this Zero did not witness their mother's death at the hands of Doc, he continued to grow and was not rendered mute. His skills at quick drawing has earned him the moniker \\"Quick Draw Zero\\". He was killed by the Vengeance Knights when Doc betrayed the group. When Ray committed suicide after being awakened as a Shinigami and then returned to human by Himekojo, Zero's spirit spoke to Himekojo, requesting her to resurrect him with the forbidden spell as an angel, and returning Ray's soul to his body. After much painful decision, Himekojo agreed, and shortly after saving Ray, Zero's soul was torn apart by Sword and her comrades. ; : Onimaru is a heavyset gunslinger in pursuit of Kurohime. He was once her most loyal soldier and his back bears a large tattoo of the kanji for \\"dog\\", with the kanji for \\"Kurohime\\" branded near it. Feeling betrayed by the apparently selfish witch, he swore revenge on her, and intends to take it now that she has been stripped of her magical powers. Ironically enough, he is still attracted to her. ; : Tsucchi is an alternate form of Onimaru. In a bid to take down Kurohime, the leader of the \\"Death Angel\\" squad, Sword, seduces Onimaru and compels him to kiss her leg, and he nearly became a hideously grotesque man-snake. However, his sheer willpower prevents the transformation from fully occurring, and he becomes a mute miniature lizard; his personality and intelligence also survive this change. After learning of Kurohime's true motivations from Shirohime, he convinces her to break the curse placed on Kurohime and afterward tags along with Himeko and Asura in their quest to Yamato. By the time for the final battle between Zero and Kurohime, Tsucchi was reverted to normal by Sword into Onimaru, and he gave Kurohime the strength to fight on by expressing his love for her. ; : Yuka is a beautiful girl who first ran into Barahime, a once seductive witch who has been drained of her magical powers by Kurohime. Barahime possessed Yuka and used the girl to help drain men of their life force to continue to be young and beautiful. However, this possession can only happen at night, as by day time, Yuka is in control of her own body. With the help of Zero and Kurohime, Barahime was extracted from Yuka. This possession has left Yuka with some magical powers, and she started to develop them. : After Zero's demise, Barahime, who was set ablaze in hellfire by Kurohime to burn forever, was saved by Sword. Barahime then possesses Yuka again, this time completely, and follows Kurohime into the past in attempt for revenge. However, Kurohime completely kills Barahime, saving Yuka. Since then, Yuka follows her savior. ; : Asura is a beautiful looking woman. The people of that land call her and her kind, demons. She is extremely powerful, possessing incredible magical powers, whose destructive properties rivals a god. She is first introduced as a mysterious character who plays a subtle hand in aiding Kurohime and Zero defeat a witch. She is next seen fighting a Mountain God and is severely wounded while protecting Zero and Kurohime. Shortly after being tended to by Zero, they are attacked again by the Mountain God, and Kurohime and Asura team up together to destroy their enemy. : She is attuned to the element of fire, and much of her magic revolves around flames. She also has a demonic form that allows her to use her powers more efficiently. However, as a demon of fire, she is vulnerable to water and cannot swim. She was initially reluctant in having anything to do with Zero and Kurohime, but after being saved by Zero and witnessing the power of a vengeful Kurohime, she has a change of heart, and tells Kurohime about her master who seems intent on helping Kurohime regain her full power. ; : Tokugawa Kazuma is the prince of the Big Edo City. He is a powerful swordsman, being able to strike with lightning speed. Later, he was given a necklace that has stones imbued with the power of the three out of four Spirit Kings by his father. This grants him great powers, but using it would require him to provide his life force to Yamatohime as an exchange; this led his hair to turn white and his health to deteriorate. Kurohime noted that Kazuma's personality is exactly the same to that of Zero and has seemingly fallen in love with Kurohime. ; and : Yukionna and Yukiotoko are the goddess and god of snow, respectively. They are childhood friends, and Yukio has fallen in love with Yuki, but Yuki was determined to fill her heart with more than one man, which led her to capture many men and freeze them solid, keeping them in her vault. Despite this, Yukio is still deeply in love with her, and is willing to do anything for her. The two of them has been assigned to guard the Spirit King Byakko, but were ultimately defeated by Kurohime. During this clash, in which Yukio has taken a formed a friendship to Kurohime, Yuki was able to realize her mistake, and showed that she truly loves Yukio, and the two reconciled. The two, indebted to Kurohime, defied Yashahime and helped Kurohime, Asura, Kazuma, and Tsucchi all the way throughout the battle against the Kurohime Punishment Squad in Big Edo City, and against the Gods when Yashahime tried to devour the planet. : In combat, Yuki has command of the element of snow and ice, while Yukio can into a sleek and combat-adept abominable snowman form. Their weakness is fire, which Kurohime took advantage of. After being defeated by Kurohime, the two were reduced to their childhood forms, but can unite into one single body to become an adult during combat. ; : Rider was a member of the Wolf Brigade first mentioned in the first volume, with the nickname \\"Lightning Bolt\\". He fights alongside Zero when Kurohime returns to the past. He accompanies the gang when the Wolf Brigade defects to the Onimaru Gang, citing his reason as feeling he still owes Doc something. This is revealed when Zero was killed and Ray left: Rider stayed only for the twins' sake, due to Rei refusing to leave Doc's side. However, as Ray finally left, Rider then killed Doc in the hospital, and then left to find Ray, all the while becoming a wanted man for murder. Ten years later, Kandata (Doc) finds Rider and eventually brings him to Dark Zero, where the two reunite, while seemingly to have lost his left eye. His weapon is a gun hammer, similar to a Monster Hunter weapon, which makes explosions with each impact. He also is a very quick shot with a pistol. ; : Doc is the greedy and nefarious leader of the Wolf Brigade. He keeps Ray close by his side in order to have Zero to fight for him, and cares nothing about his men as long as he gets money. To this end, he sacrifices the wounded of the Wolf Brigade to the Lion Castle in order to launch a flank attack. After the battle ends, most of the Wolf Brigade beats him up then defects to the Onimaru Gang. He travels with the group, but it is discovered that he stole an obscene amount of money from the military, which lands the group in prison. : It is later revealed that he was , the ferryman of the River Styx, first appearing in Volume 1. His desire to learn why Ray spared his life was so strong that even after death he would not settle in Hell as other sinners did, thus becoming the ferryman. =Antagonists= ; : Darkray was the former God of Death, and one of the six High Gods. He fought Kurohime when she first challenged the gods. Using the soul of an infant murdered by an attack on Kurohime as a shield, he defeated her with Sword, slicing her in half. He was also the one who suggested splitting Kurohime into two beings: one consisting of pure hate, the other, of love and compassion. This resulted in the birth of Shirohime (White Princess), the Goddess of Mercy. He later appears in the fourth volume, not long after Kurohime killed the mountain god Moai. He orders Shirohime to seal Kurohime's powers so that he and his death angels could kill her. ; : Yashahime is the Mother Goddess of Earth, one of the six high gods, and lover of Darkray. She swears to kill Kurohime to avenge the fallen God of Death, and first appears when Kurohime killed Gandhara on Yamato. She is very powerful, with a beauteous appearance masking a fearsome treelike form. : During confrontations between the two, Yashahime shows not only extreme sadism, but a dual personality of sorts: being polite and calm in one moment, but revealing her cruel and true form when angered. Aside from her command over the earth and trees, Yashahime also wields the Hakushinboku (White God Tree), which is said to be a symbol of divine power, and the opposite of Kurohime's Kokushinboku (Black God Tree). Her twisted personality and extreme power makes even Darkray to fear her in the past. =Kurohime Punishment Squad= Shortly after Kurohime and Zero killing the God of Death Darkray, Sword, the only surviving Death Angel of the battle, gathered a crew of powerful magical witch gunslingers, all of whom have a grudge against Kurohime, in order to avenge themselves by killing her, thus forming the . ; : Also known as Reikahime, Sword is the leader of the sent after Kurohime and Zero. She and her comrades (, , , , and ) are sent to reap a group of vengeful souls from a ghost wagon who were revived courtesy of Kurohime. Sword seems to have a personal vendetta against Kurohime, leading her and her fellow death angels in an attempt to kill her by turning members of the Onimaru Gang into large demonic snakes. : Sword (and former enemies of Kurohime) reappear in the second arc as part of the Kurohime Punishment Squad. She displays several new abilities, notably the ability to manipulate blood and suck her victim's veins dry of it, and a new outfit that makes her appear more human (compared to her initial appearance). ; : Barahime is a witch who used to steal the lives of men in order to maintain her youth. She was defeated by Kurohime before the start of the series, and subsequently lost her youth. Barahime then went on to possess Yuka, a young girl. Her possession was incomplete, only allowing her to take complete control at night, but she was able to use Yuuka's beauty to once again kill men and keep her youthful appearance. Once again defeated by Kurohime, she was separated from Yuuka, and cursed to burn. The flame was extinguished by Sword, leader of the Death Angel Squad, who invited her to join the Kurohime Punishment Squad. She once again possessed Yuuka, this time completely, and with the rest of the squad was sent back in time with Kurohime after their battle in Edo city. ; : Oka is another member of the Kurohime Punishment Squad. She has abilities that are similar to Kurohime's, such as summoning dragons as well as amazing skill as a sniper. In fact, her ability to fire witch bullets through sniping and retain high levels of control surpasses Kurohime's capabilities. As a child, Oka was the princess of one of the kingdoms that was destroyed by Kurohime during her attempt to increase her magic in preparation for her assault on the gods. Later, at the Tower of the Gods, Oka attempted and failed to murder Kurohime who spared Oka and gave her a sword like witch-gun, telling her that if she really wanted revenge then she should learn to use magic. Unlike the other members of the Kurohime Punishment Squad, Oka dislikes involving innocent bystanders but is willing to use any methods she deems necessary to kill Kurohime. ; : Aika is Saika's lover and a magic gun user of the Kurohime punishment squad, she's nearly blind from birth but can concentrate her magic to sense her surroundings. She temporarily took his \\"most sacred\\" thing in return for him cheating on her, but she loves him to the extent of risking her life for him. ; : Saika is a pretty boy who sought to make Kurohime his in chapter 3, but was spurned after she realized he was only interested in her power. He returns as part of the Kurohime punishment squad to get revenge since Aika, his lover found out he cheated on her and removed his \\"most sacred\\" thing. In spite of this he truly loves Aika, becoming her eyes in exchange for her love, since she will love him after his beauty fades. Siding with the Materen in an attempt to kill Kurohime, Saika was betrayed and captured by the Materen's leader who intended to use their magic to transform him into an artificial death angel who would then exterminate all humanity. =Spirit Kings= The four Spirit Kings are the only spirits who has their own free wills by each possessing a soul, while other spirits, also known as demons or devils by humans, do not. They are the life forces of the world, a power which the gods covet. Along with this, when the four spirits imbue their life forces into the Yamato Tachi sword, it can become the god-slaying sword. To these ends, the gods captured the Spirit Kings to prevent the sword's completion, as well as slowly drain them of their life forces for their lust of power. Only Seiryu, the Spirit King of the Wind, was able to elude capture. They assist Kurohime in completing the Ultimate Sword, despite their hatred for humans for polluting the world. ; : Yamatohime is also known as the Phoenix , Devil God, and Spirit Queen of Fire. She is Asura's master, and was imprisoned by the gods in the depths of a volcano, under constant watch by the Demon God Gandhara. After Kurohime arrives in Asura and slays Gandara, Yamatohime gives Kurohime a sword hardened by the sun; the Yamato-Dachi, and a lotus flower with seventeen (originally 19) petals, each representing a memory of Zero. A petal from the flower will fall every time Kurohime reverts to her true form. She assigns Asura with the task of guiding Himeko to the four spirit kings, whose power, when added to Yamato- Dachi, will be enough to free herself. Yamatohime says she will revive Zero if Himeko can successfully release her, then sends the group away as Tor, God of War, and Yashahime arrive in response to Gandhara's defeat. As Yamatohime is the very life of the planet, she cannot be taken into the blade, so Asura was instead created to serve as replacement. By the time the Absolute Sword was complete, Yamatohime has already been reduced to a childlike form and her body rusting, her energy greatly drained. ; : Genbu is the Spirit King of Water. He was captured by Saiyuki, the goddess of the ogres, and through his imprisonment grants her the abilities of turning to intangible mist and liquid, as well as crafting ice for offense and an impenetrable rock-scaled armor. Disgusted by the ways humans pollute the earth and hunt other creatures to extinction, Genbu was willing to remain imprisoned by the gods. Kurohime convinced him though that humans did have the potential for good and he willingly sacrificed himself to Yamato Senryu. By doing so, he bestowed on Kurohime the ability to summon the same armor Saiyuki wielded as well the ability to transform Yamato Senryu into Genbu Yamato Senryu, a shotgun with a barrel shaped like a Dragon. ; : Byakko is the Spirit King of Earth. He was captured by the snow goddess Yuki-onna (Yuki) and her lover abominable snowman Yuki-otoko (Yukio), and was encased completely behind a giant ice wall. Although willing to sacrifice himself in the name of ending the Gods' tyranny, he was hesitant to grant his powers to Kurohime, who by that time had lost almost all her memories of Zero. But after seeing that her love for Zero remained intact, Byakko transferred his power to Yamato Senryu and enabling it to transform into a Gatling gun weapon called Byakko Yamato Senryu, which can fire multiple witch bullets over a short period. ; : Seiryu is the Spirit King of Wind. As the wind has no solid form, he is the only one of the four Spirit Kings not to be captured by the Gods, being able to evade them. Also, as space-time also has no solid form, like the wind, Seiryu has control of that as well. He took the form of the ocean dragon, Kairyu, and assisted Kurohime against a group of fishermen hunting for mermaid flesh, and then later led her to Zero's past, as per Kandata's request. When she returned and learned of Zero and Rei's past, and were attacked by Yashahime, Seiryu revealed his true form and deemed Kurohime to be worthy of his power, as her love for Zero is still strong, and let his own soul be transferred into the Yamato Senryu, which allows it to transform into a rifle with the size of a bazooka. This weapon, when used by Oka, had to ability to send the person it shoots back in time, as Asura was sent back to the time just as Kurohime missed her with the initial shot. ; : Kairyu is the sea dragon, who first appeared to grant Himeko her wish to see Zero again. However, as it was a mere illusion, it didn't satisfy her at the very least. When the Kurohime Punishment Squad took over his body and used him against Kurohime, he manages to escape from their grasp in his smaller medium body and takes Kurohime back to the past, to understand Zero more. When they return to the present, Kairyu reveals his true identity, Seiryu, during the battle against Yashahime. Publication Kurohime is written and illustrated by Masanori Ookamigumi Katakura.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and then served in the Soviet Navy as T-338. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-133, Captivate was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-156, on 21 February 1942. She was launched on 1 December 1942 at Portland, Oregon, by Willamette Iron and Steel Works and commissioned on 30 December 1943 with Lieutenant B. J. Kocel USNR, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945= Reporting to the United States Pacific Fleet for assignment, Captivate stood out of San Francisco, California, on 11 March 1944 bound for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, and Majuro in the Marshall Islands. Arriving at Majuro on 10 April 1944, she operated as harbor entrance patrol and pilot vessel, occasionally escorting convoys to the other islands of the Marshalls group. Leaving Majuro on 22 September 1944, she moved to the Mariana Islands, where she escorted convoys and patrolled off Tinian until 14 October 1944. Arriving in the newly captured Palau Islands on 23 October 1944, Captivate performed patrol and escort duties there until 3 February 1945, when she moved to Eniwetok to perform similar duties through the remainder of February 1945. Arriving at Portland, Oregon, on 27 March 1945, Captivate moved to Seattle, Washington, where she aided in training programs until 6 July 1945. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Captivate proceeded to Cold Bay to begin familiarization training of her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Captivate was decommissioned on 17 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-338 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Captivate to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-156 on 7 February 1955. Disposal T-338 was scrapped in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Captivate on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

A saddle roof is a roof form which follows a convex curve about one axis and a concave curve about the other. The hyperbolic paraboloid form has been used for roofs at various times since it is easily constructed from straight sections of lumber, steel, or other conventional materials.A Dictionary of Architecture, Fleming, Honour, Pevsner The term is used because the form resembles the shape of a saddle. Sometimes referred to as a hypar, the saddle roof may also be formed as a tensegrity structure.Membrane Structures: Understanding Their Forms, Prof. Dr. Eng. M.

The sister of British diplomat Effingham Grant and wife of radical leader C. A. Rosetti, she played an active part in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. She was also noted for her enduring friendships with the painter Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and with Pia BrƒÉtianu, the wife of National Liberal politician Ion BrƒÉtianu. The Rosettis were parents to eight sons: Mircea, Ion, VintilƒÉ (journalist and writer), Horia, Elena-Maria, Toni, Floricel and Libertatea Sophia, all of whom were noted for their political activities. Biography Born to Captain Edward Grant, a ship-owning resident of Guernsey, and his Guernsey wife Marie Le Lacheur, Marie belonged to the Church of England.Cernovodeanu, p.38, 39 The Grants, who eventually settled in Plymouth, claimed lineage from the Scottish Clan Grant of Cannon, but this is uncertain.Cernovodeanu, p.38 =Life= In 1837, her younger brother Effingham was appointed secretary of Robert Gilmour Colquhoun, the British consul in Wallachia; soon after, Mary herself arrived in Bucharest, where she began work as a tutor.Cernovodeanu, p.38-39 It was then that she met Rosetti, Effingham Grant's close friend and a member of the Rosetti family of boyars, who fell in love with her.Cernovodeanu, p.39 Mary Grant was employed by the family of Wallachian Militia Colonel Ioan Odobescu, and gave lessons to his children‚Äîincluding his son Alexandru, the future writer and politician. At the time, she was residing in the Bucharest area around Curtea Veche. Grant married C. A. Rosetti at her family's house in Plymouth, with an Anglican service (August 31, 1847); they remarried later in Vienna, through an Orthodox ceremony. The latter was attended by Rosetti's collaborators, ≈ûtefan and Alexandru Golescu, who were the couple's godfathers. According to historian Paul Cernovodeanu, she met difficulty in integrating boyar society, but \\"[her] innate qualities, noble demeanor, intelligence and culture did not fail [...] to impose her\\". Revolutionary Romania, painted by Rosenthal in homage to Rosetti During the 1848 revolution, her husband played a prominent part in rallying the Bucharest populace to the radical cause, and sat on the Provisional Government. As Ottoman troops entered the country, crushing the rebellion and arresting its leaders, he was himself taken into Ottoman custody and, together with other prominent participants, transported by barge from Giurgiu, on his way to the Austrian-ruled Svini≈£a, near the Danube port of Orschowa.Frunzetti, p.18-20; Georgescu, p.79-80 With the Jewish Constantin Daniel Rosenthal, Maria followed the ships on shore; upon arrival, she pointed out to the local authorities that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, persuading the mayor of Svini≈£a to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee.Frunzetti, p.20 The Rosettis then made their way to France.Frunzetti, p.21; Georgescu, p.80; Livezeanu & Farris, p.283 Her role in this last stage of the revolution was celebrated by French historian Jules Michelet in his 1851 essay Madame Rosetti,Cernovodeanu, p.39; Georgescu, p.79; Livezeanu & Farris, p.284 and by her husband, who compared her to Anita, the Brazilian-born wife of Italian insurgent Giuseppe Garibaldi.Alin CiupalƒÉ, Femeia √Æn societatea rom√¢neascƒÉ a secolului al XIX- lea, Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 2003, p.69.

Such activities give Rosetti a claim to the title of Romania's first female journalist, ahead of Maria Flechtenmacher. Maria Rosetti was subsequently involved in organizing charity events and public ceremonies: in 1866‚Äì1867, she raised funds to combat famine, and, in 1871, organized celebrations in the Moldavian locality of Putna. Her prestige increased especially after 1875, when C. A. Rosetti joined the National Liberal Party's leadership.\\"C. A. Rosetti\\" , in the Ohio University's Encyclopedia of Revolutions of 1848 , retrieved July 16, 2007 As a journalist, she contributed articles promoting women's liberation. In 1877, as Romania proclaimed her independence and joined the Russian Empire in the anti-Ottoman war, Maria Rosetti rallied funds to aid the wounded, establishing and managing the hospital in Turnu MƒÉgurele. Maria and C. A. Rosetti had eight children, only four of whom reached adulthood. These were a daughter, Liberty Sofia (commonly known as Libby, born June 1848) and three sons born in exile: Mircea, VintilƒÉ and Horia Rosetti. Her brother was himself a resident of Romania, and married to Zoe, the daughter of Wallachian landowner and politician Alexandru Racovi≈£ƒÉ (among their children was the painter Nicolae Grant).Cernovodeanu, p.39-40 Through her brother Effingham, who married into the Racovi≈£ƒÉ family, Maria Rosetti was also distantly related with physician Carol Davila and his son, playwright Alexandru Davila.George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ √Æn prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986, p.653 =Death= Upon her death, a large obituary was published in the National Liberal newspaper Voin≈£a Na≈£ionalƒÉ, who proclaimed her one of the most outstanding Romanian women of her generation. Her writings of the 1860s were collected in an 1893 volume carrying Michelet's introduction.Livezeanu & Farris, p.284 She is also one of the characters in Camil Petrescu's novel Un om √Æntre oameni. A street in central Bucharest, nearby Bulevardul Magheru, was named in her honor‚Äîit constitutes the eastward extension of C. A.

Only, this insistence upon Chinese peculiarities is misleading, taking us away from the ultimate truth that these differences are traceable not to some occult inheritance, but to tradition and training and environment.... :This is a pity in Oil for the Lamps of China.

He was the founder of the Wolf Foundation.Ricardo Wolf: from the Jewish scientist to the Cuban diplomat Early years Ricardo Wolf was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1887. He was one of 14 children born to Moritz Wolf, a pillar of that city‚Äôs Jewish community. Before the First World War, Wolf emigrated from Germany to Cuba, which became his second home. In 1924, he married Francisca Subirana, a tennis champion of the 1920s. Later years For many years, Ricardo Wolf and his brother Sigfried Wolf worked to develop a process for recovering iron from smelting process residue. Ultimately successful, his invention was utilized in steel factories all over the world, bringing him considerable wealth. Wolf lent both moral and financial support to Fidel Castro from the onset of the Cuban revolution. Beholden to Ricardo Wolf for his unswerving support, and cognizant of his personality and natural gifts as a diplomat, the Cuban leader offered him the position of Minister of Finance and, after Wolf declined, responded to Wolf‚Äôs request and appointed him in 1961 Cuban Ambassador to Israel. Wolf held this position until 1973, the year Cuba severed diplomatic ties with Israel. Upon relinquishing his diplomatic post, Wolf decided to remain in Israel, where he spent his final years. Establishment of Wolf Foundation In 1975, Ricardo Wolf established the Wolf Foundation. The Wolf Prize has been awarded since 1978 by the Wolf Foundation.

Ryumin was born in a peasant village in the Kuban area. Reputedly, his family were wealthy farmers, his brother and sister were convicted thieves, and his father in law fought against the Bolsheviks in the White Army commanded by Admiral Kolchak.Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks, The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness ‚Äì a Soviet Spymaster (Warner Books, 1995) p. 299. Despite his background, he survived the wholesale arrests of 'kulaks' instigated by Josif Stalin, and by about 1931 was working as bookkeeper on a collective farm in the Urals. His next break came after Nikolai Yezhov ordered the mass arrest of NKVD officers suspected of loyalty to his predecessor, Genrikh Yagoda in 1937, when Ryumin joined the NKVD as a bookkeeper. He worked for SMERSH during the war, and in 1948 was transferred to the Department for Specially Important Cases, within the MGB. Ryumin personally tortured prisoners in the Sukhanovo Prison, and appears to have enjoyed doing it. His victims included a young American, Alexander Dolgun who was arrested in Moscow in 1948, but later released and deported. In his memoirs, he recalled being told by Ryumin: \\"I have a Cossack method of beating. I draw as I hit. You will never have felt such pain! Ever!\\".Alexander Dolgun and Patrick Wilson, Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag (Random House, 1975) p. 197. Ryumin then beat him unconscious, using a two- foot long rubber club. Early in 1949, he supervised the interrogation of Boris Shimeliovich, a long-standing party member who came under suspicion because of his war time involvement in the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. Accused of terrorism, he refused to confess, and was beaten so badly that he had to be brought in on a stretcher for his interrogation to continue. At his trial, Shimeliovich told the judge: \\"I received approximately eighty to one hundred blows a day, so altogether I think I was hit about two thousand times.\\"Joshua Rubenstein and Vladimir P. Naumov, Stalin's Secret Pogrom, The Postwar Inquisition of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (Yale University Press, 2001) p. 287. In 1950, Ryumin began the interrogation of Professor Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger, an eminent, elderly Jewish cardiologist, who had made critical remarks about the regime to family and friends. Dr. Etinger had treated two very high ranking communists, Andrei Zhdanov and Alexander Shcherbakov who had died from heart disease. Ryumin tried to force him to confess to murdering them both. This was the origin of the Doctors' Plot, one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice of the Stalin era. It is not known whether it was originally Ryumin's idea, or whether Stalin put him up to it. According to a fellow officer, Ryumin was a \\"notorious anti-semitic\\" but \\"primitive\\".Sudoplatov, pp. 280, 306. At his trial in 1953, he was described as \\"half-educated\\" and \\"dim-witted\\". Stalin nicknamed him the \\"pygmy\\".Jonathan Brent and Vladimir P. Naumov, Stalin's Last Crime, The Doctors' Plot (John Murray, 2004) p. 108. After Etinger had been put through 37 separate interrogations between November 1950 and January 1951, Ryumin was ordered by the Minister of State Security Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov to ease up because medical staff had warned that stress might kill the elderly prisoner, despite which Ryumin carried out another 39 interrogations, accompanied by sleep deprivation and other abuses until Etinger's death on 2 March 1951.Brent and Naumov, p. 101. Ryumin was reprimanded, and fearing worse was to come, wrote to Stalin on 2 July 1951 accusing Abakumov of covering up a plot by Jewish terrorists. Reputedly the letter was largely written for him by an official named Dmitri Sukhanov, who ran the private office of Georgi Malenkov.Sudoplatov, p. 299. Stalin's reaction was to promote Ryumin to head of the Department for Specially Important Cases, and to dismiss Abakumov, who was arrested. Ryumin then handled the investigation of the so-called Doctors' Plot, until he was abruptly sacked on 13 November 1952, apparently because Stalin had decided that he was too incompetent to do the job. He then returned to his old profession as a book keeper. The Doctor's Plot was denounced as a fabrication soon after the death of Stalin in March 1953.

Life A scion of the distinguished line of Bucellini counts, Gabriel, at the age of thirteen, entered the Benedictine monastery at Weingarten. After a course in philosophy and theology at the Jesuit University of Dillingen he was ordained a priest on April 23, 1624. In the same year he was sent, as master of novices, to restore the primitive fervour and raise the standard of studies in the monastery of St. Trudpert in the Black Forest. In 1627 he became secretary to Abbott Franz Dietrich and to the Swabian Benedictine congregation. He filled the position of master of novices at Weingarten and professor of humanities at Feldkirch (1635), from which on the approach of the Swedish army he was forced to flee to Vienna, Venice, and finally Admont (1646). There he was appointed prior of St. John's monastery, Feldkirch (1651), where he remained until a few months before his death, when he returned to Weingarten. Works Bucelin was a universal scholar and a very prolific writer, being the author of some fifty-three works on genealogy, world history, hagiography and church history. He also drew maps and plans. A large number of his works are still in manuscript in the state library at Stuttgart. Many of his works remained unpublished, perhaps because of the disruptions of war. His chief claim to contemporary fame lies in the fact that he was, if not the first, at least among the first authors to deal with the ecclesiastical history of Germany. Of his published works the most important are: *Germania sacra (Augsburg, 1655), containing accounts of the principal ecclesiastics, archbishops, abbots, etc., as well as a list of the most important monasteries of Germany *Germaniae topo-chrono-stemmatographia sacra et profana (1665‚Äì78), treating, as its name implies, of the genealogy of the most distinguished members of the clergy and the nobility *Constantia sacra et profana (Frankfort, 1667) *Rhaetia etrusca, romana, gallica, germanica (Augsburg, 1661) *Nuclei Historiae universalis cum sacrae... (Ulm, 1650, 1654; carried from 1650 to 1735 by Schmier, Apparatum ad theologiam scholastico- polemico-practicam), of great importance to scholars interested in ancient charts, bulls, diplomata, etc. Bucelin was also the author of many works on the Benedictine Order and its most illustrious members, among them Aquila imperii benedictina (Venice, 1651), Annales Benedictini (Vienna 1655, Augsburg 1656) and Menologium benedictinum (Feldkirch, 1655).

Leyel is author of a book on herbalism, called Elixirs of Life,Mrs. C.F.Leyel - Elixirs of Life - Kegan Paul (2002) among other works on the subject, as well as the cookery book The Gentle Art of Cookery.Leyel, H. and Hartley, O. The Gentle Art of Cookery, Kegan Paul (2003) She was a fellow of the Royal Institution and an officer of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Background and early career Leyel was born in London and educated at Uppingham School, where her father Edward Wauton was a teacher. While still young, she developed a precocious interest in herbs and flowers and after leaving school studied medicine. She worked briefly with Frank Benson, who was an actor-manager, and in 1900 married Carl Frederick Leyel (d.1925), a theatrical manager with whom she had two sons. They later divorced. As a young woman in Lincoln's Inn, she developed an interest in food and wine and made influential friends, who rallied to her support in 1922 when she was prosecuted for running the Golden Ballot, a charity which raised money for ex-servicemen and various hospitals. Her acquittal helped to establish the legality of such ballots. She was elected a life governor of St Mary's, the West London, and the Royal National Orthopaedic hospitals. Herbalism Leyel became very interested in herbalism, and with her academic training in botany, she studied the work of the herbalist Nicholas Culpeper, among others. She wrote The Magic of Herbs in 1926, and in 1927 she opened Culpeper House on Baker Street, a shop selling herbal medicines, food and cosmetics; these proved very successful, especially with women. She founded the Society of Herbalists, a non-profit organization, for the study and application of herbalism. In 1941 the society's existence was threatened by the Pharmacy and Medicines Bill, which would have destroyed the work of the herbalist in England. Influential friends rallied to Leyel's support, and the bill was modified to enable patients to obtain treatment upon joining the society. She also joined Sir Albert Howard in his campaign for compost versus synthetic fertilizers, and those working for pure water and food. Works In 1931 Leyel edited Mrs M Grieve's A Modern Herbal in two volumes. She herself wrote a long series of works on herbs, including Herbal Delights (1937), Compassionate Herbs (1946), Elixirs of Life (1948), Hearts- Ease (1949), Green Medicine (1952), and Cinquefoil (1957), as well as others on cooking.

Unlike the SSO, male and female performers are not separated in the IYO. Performances and Recordings In 1999 and 2004, the IYO toured China and Germany as a temporary chamber ensemble named 'Isang Yun Ensemble Pyongyang'. Their 1999 tour to Berlin consisted of five chamber works of Isang Yun, and was recorded by the German recording company WERGO. The recording was released and imported to South Korea a few years later. In 2005, the South Korean recording company Synnara Music released four CDs which contain North Korean orchestral works performed by SSO, IYO and other music troupes of North Korea.

Its petals are yellow on both sides, with the exception of dark purple nectar guides on the front of the lower three petals. The flowers arise from the same stems as the leaves. Viola glabella is a perennial herb, growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) and blooming from April to July. The plant is deciduous and dies back completely to its roots during Autumn. Viola glabella prefers moist, well-drained soil and can grow in part shade. Acidic and neutral soils are suitable for Viola glabella, which prefers a pH between 6 and 6.5, and becomes chlorotic if the pH is too high. Young leaves and flower buds are edible, raw or cooked, but the yellow flowers can cause diarrhoea. References *Hitchcock, Charles Leo and Cronquist, Arthur. Flora of the Pacific Northwest.

This permits device drivers and other low-level event consumers to perform the high- priority part of their processing quickly, and schedule non-critical additional processing for execution at a lower priority. DPCs are implemented by DPC objects which are created and initialized by the kernel when a device driver or some other kernel mode program issues requests for DPC. The DPC request is then added to the end of a DPC queue. Each processor has a separate DPC queue. DPCs have three priority levels: low, medium and high. By default, all DPCs are set to medium priority. When Windows drops to an IRQL of Dispatch/DPC level, it checks the DPC queue for any pending DPCs and executes them until the queue is empty or some other interrupt with a higher IRQL occurs. For example, when the clock interrupt is generated, the clock interrupt handler generally increments the counter of the current thread to calculate the total execution time of that thread, and decrements its quantum time remaining by 1. When the counter drops to zero, the thread scheduler has to be invoked to choose the next thread to be executed on that processor and dispatcher to perform a context switch. Since the clock interrupt occurs at a much higher IRQL, it will be desirable to perform this thread dispatching which is a less critical task at a later time when the processor's IRQL drops. So the clock interrupt handler requests a DPC object and adds it to the end of the DPC queue which will process the dispatching when the processor's IRQL drops to DPC/Dispatch level. When working with streaming audio or video that uses interrupts, DPCs are used to process the audio in each buffer as they stream in. If another DPC (from a poorly written driver) takes too long and another interrupt generates a new buffer of data, before the first one can be processed, a drop-out results.

Selim is listed in the Pioneer Club of San Francisco and The Society of California Pioneers. Franklin Street in San Francisco is most likely named for him. Born in Liverpool into an English-Jewish family, he was a son of Lewis Franklin, a Liverpool banker, and Miriam Abraham. He emigrated from England to San Francisco for the California Gold Rush in October 1849. He was joined by brother Edward and cousins Lewis and Maurice Franklin. Another brother Lumley Franklin arrived in 1854. In 1850 Selim and Edward Franklin ran a zinc-front store on Clay Street Wharf selling mining equipment and supplies. In 1851 they established Selim & Edward Franklin Real Estate and Auctioneers on 77 Battery Street near Long Wharf. Advertisements of properties appeared in The Daily Alta California newspaper. In 1854 they relocated to 102 Merchant Street between Montgomery and Kearny. Selim and brother Edward built the Franklin House at 203-205 Sansome in 1852. The Annals of San Francisco (1855) lists the Franklin House as one of five more upscale hotels in the city. Permanent residents included physicians, attorneys and a judge. Cousins Lewis and Maurice Franklin relocated to San Diego and built the Franklin House there in 1855, the first three-story building in Southern California. In 1858 he moved to Victoria, British Columbia, with his brother Lumley Franklin and opened Franklin & Company, Auctioneers and Land Agents on Yates Street. Franklin & Company ran full-page ads in the daily newspaper, The British Colonist, to list items for auction: real estate, furniture, cattle, and vehicles. Because they were British-born, they were appointed by Governor James Douglas as the first government auctioneers in Victoria and British Columbia. Selim was an advisor to Queen Victoria in the 1859 Oregon boundary dispute over the San Juan Islands. In 1859 Selim was elected to the Legislature of British Columbia, becoming the first Jew to take a seat in any legislature in British North America. He achieved the title of Esquire and was a founding member of the Freemason lodge in Victoria. Franklin was Chairman of the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition of 1864. The Franklin River on Vancouver Island is named for him.http://archive.ilmb.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=4347 Selim and brother Lumley were founders and executive members of the Victoria Philharmonic Society. After resigning from the British Columbia Legislature in 1866, he returned to San Francisco. In 1879 he was listed as a Trustee of the Mineral Fork Mining and Silver Company (Utah), listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange. In 1881, Scientific American listed Franklin as a Trustee of the Geographical Society of the Pacific, based in San Francisco. Selim died sometime after May 1885, most likely from injuries sustained after falling down the stairs in his home. Of the five Franklin cousins that came to San Francisco during the Gold Rush, only Selim lived to see nephew Selim Maurice Franklin graduate from University of California Law School in 1883. Edward died in Martinez, California, in 1873. Lumley died in San Francisco later in 1873 while taking care of his brother Edward's estate. Maurice died in San Francisco in 1874 while seeking medical care there. Lewis died in London in 1879. Nephew Selim M. Franklin was elected to the Arizona Legislature in 1884 and later became a founder of the University of Arizona. Chess Master Selim Franklin was a world-ranked chess player from the renowned chess clubs in London, especially the Westminster Chess Club and Simpson's Divan Chess Room. In 1857 he was on the Planning & Rules Committee for the first American Chess Congress held in New York, which propelled 20-year-old American Paul Morphy into an international chess celebrity overnight. Franklin was President of the California Chess Congress that established San Francisco as a world chess center. The event began on March 22, 1858, at the Hall in Hunt's Building, San Francisco (three San Francisco chess clubs joined together to host the Congress: the Mechanic's Institute, the German Chess Club of San Francisco, and the Pioneer Chess Club). Franklin won the tournament and the first prize \\"of a costly gold watch\\". After this victory one system of rating historical chess players ranks him as 108th in the world. Franklin participated in several London chess matches from 1868‚Äì1871. His last high- profile match was against chess master Johannes Zukertort in San Francisco at the Mechanics' Institute Chess Room in 1884. Zukertort played Wilhelm Steinitz in the World Chess Championship 1886.

History Detail of the front entrance, -1895.The Press building in 2010. Theodore Low De Vinne, a leading New York typographer and printer who was one of nine men who founded the Grolier Club (an organization devoted to the history of printing), had the building constructed for his printing company. The press printed several leading American magazines, including the St. Nicholas Magazine, Scribner's Monthly and The Century. De Vinne also wrote books such as The Invention of Printing, Correct Composition and Title Pages. De Vinne died in February 1914, and by 1922, the company ceased operations. In 1904, architect and art critic Russell Sturgis said in The Architectural Record that \\"No photographs give the full sense of its bigness, its breadth and its mass. More than once visitors on their way to see it have been pulled up suddenly by a sudden sense of its large presence.\\" In 2003, architectural historian Christopher Gray of The New York Times described the building as \\"among the most sophisticated works of masonry in New York, a tour de force of honestly simple bricklaying built for one of the premier printing companies of a century ago.\\" Originally, De Vinne's financial stake in the property was limited to 25 percent with the remainder held by Roswell Smith, founder of the Century Company. Seven years after the press closed, De Vinne's heirs sold their interest to Smith's estate in 1929. The building later became a metalwork factory, and in 1938, the Smith estate sold the property to the Walter Peek Paper Corporation. In 1982, Walter Peek sold the building to Edwin Fisher. It is now occupied by the 11,000 square foot Astor Center, owned by the Fisher family.

Berman, and starring Clark Gable and Lana Turner. The supporting cast features Claire Trevor, Frank Morgan, Marjorie Main, Albert Dekker and Chill Wills. Plot Con man \\"Candy\\" Johnson (Clark Gable) and his friend \\"Sniper\\" (Chill Wills) flee town using quick wits and magic tricks. They catch a train to Yellow Creek, Nevada, where a gold rush is in progress. Aboard, he meets Elizabeth Cotton (Lana Turner); she takes an instant dislike to him. When they arrive, Candy is amused to discover she is the daughter of \\"Judge\\" Cotton (Frank Morgan), an old acquaintance of his. Elizabeth is unaware of her father's crooked past and present. Later that night, Candy, Sniper and the judge go to the local saloon. There, Candy finds another old friend of his, \\"Gold Dust\\" Nelson (Claire Trevor). She points out to him the owner (and sheriff), Brazos Hearn (Albert Dekker). When a gambler claims that the saloon is crooked, Candy takes his side. He forces Brazos into a game of Russian Roulette with him. The sheriff gives up after the fourth round and gives Candy $5000 to end the contest. Candy later reveals to Sniper and the judge that he had palmed the bullet; the gun was unloaded. When Candy brings the judge home, Elizabeth berates him for getting her father drunk and being a bad influence. Candy overhears a hotel guest, Mrs. Varner (Marjorie Main), the widow of a preacher, say there is no church in the town. Candy gives her $1,500 to build one. Before leaving, Candy manages to kiss Elizabeth three times before being slapped. Mrs. Varner asks her why she did not stop him at the second. Candy opens a rival saloon and gambling den, which becomes more popular than Brazos'. Gold Dust becomes jealous of Elizabeth and tells her not to expect a wedding ring. Undiscouraged, Elizabeth gets Candy to marry her by first getting him drunk. When Candy tells his new father-in-law, Cotton confesses to Elizabeth that he and Candy are both cheap crooks, and there is no hope of reforming either one. Elizabeth refuses to give up hope. That night, she locks Candy out of her bedroom in order for them to have a \\"proper courtship\\", infuriating him. He breaks down the door only to tell her \\"goodnight\\" and then storms off to have a \\"private\\" dinner with Gold Dust. Elizabeth shows up and makes up with Candy. The next morning, she persuades him to leave his guns at home. Brazos, seeing he is unarmed, sends one of his men to shoot him. Candy turns out to have a concealed weapon, and kills the man. Brazos tries to call it murder, but the townspeople disagree. When Candy learns that Brazos had appointed himself sheriff, he gets himself elected as his replacement. He soon controls the town and amasses a huge fortune through various underhanded means. Even Brazos joins him. When Elizabeth announces that she is pregnant, Candy is overjoyed. Upon hearing the news, the judge asks Elizabeth how Candy acquired the wealth to build her a mansion. When she replies that she doesn't care about Candy's method, only the results, Cotton tells her that she did not change Candy, he changed her. Candy's men pressure him to dispose of the judge, who is telling the townsfolk all he knows about Candy's setup. To save Cotton's life, Candy puts him on a train out of town, but the judge returns and is shot in the back by Brazos during a town meeting. When she hears of her father's death, Elizabeth falls from her carriage, losing the baby and nearly her own life. Following her life-saving operation, a distraught Candy decides to leave Elizabeth, as he is no good for her. Before he can, Candy learns of an armed confrontation between the townspeople and his men barricaded in city hall. Candy goes inside. He shoots it out with Brazos, who has taken over, and kills him. Then he lies to the crooks, telling them the governor has dispatched the militia to attack them (when in actuality, the corrupt governor offered Candy the militia to put down the rebellious townspeople). The crooks all flee. Candy and Sniper brazen their way out of town and end up at a hotel in Cheyenne. Sniper sends Elizabeth a telegram telling her where they are.

They made two other films together, Homecoming (1948) and Betrayed (1954). When cast, Lana Turner was only twenty and her star was flying high, having just starred in the successful films Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Ziegfeld Girl. MGM was looking to make Turner its replacement for the deceased platinum beauty Jean Harlow and therefore cast her alongside the \\"King of Hollywood\\" himself, Clark Gable. Turner was thrilled at the opportunity of working with Gable, but he was not, as she was twenty years his junior and quite green to the world of Hollywood. When reading lines with her idol, Turner was flustered and blundered quite often. Gable said, \\"She couldn't read lines. She didn't make them mean anything; it was obvious she was an amateur.\\" Nevertheless, the pairing proved successful and their steamy scenes together were unnerving to almost everyone, including Mrs. Clark Gable, Carole Lombard. She knew that Gable had an affinity for blondes and upon hearing of Turner's casting, went to production head Louis B. Mayer and told him to specifically tell Turner that Gable was entirely off-limits. Lombard had a habit of making surprise visits to the sets and was noticeably present during the bedroom scene with Turner and Gable. Turner was so intimidated by Lombard's presence that she went into her dressing room and refused to come out. When she did, Lombard was nowhere to be found. While Turner always vehemently denied rumors that she and Gable were involved in an affair, only going as far as to say she was quite smitten with him but looked up to him as more of a father-figure than anything else, it has always been speculated that a Turner and Gable affair had something to do with Lombard's last minute decision to take a plane back to Los Angeles rather than a train, resulting in the crash which took her life. Turner claimed that the only time she and Gable ever saw each other outside of a professional environment was in the months following Lombard's death. Louis B.

Turner found him a lonely, broken man and a ghost of his former self.Honky Tonk, tcm.com Reception Contemporary reviews appraised the film as about average to good. Theodore Strauss of The New York Times described the film as mostly \\"a crowd-catching midway exhibit in which Miss Turner gives a competent, if limited, performance and Mr. Gable again shows off his muscles.\\" Variety, however, called the performances \\"uniformly good\\" and noted that the screenplay \\"though padded a bit and still open to cutting, is excellent for this action picture purpose.\\" Film Daily wrote, \\"Both Gable and Miss Turner give ace accounts of themselves in the leads, and there are some slick bits by their fellow players ... Jack Conway's two-fisted direction makes for solidity and realism, and Harold Rosson's photography is expert.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"As the rough romantic lover, Clark Gable seems to have done it again, for he is all that and more.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called the film \\"Just a plain Western.\\" The film was the third most popular film in the US in 1941. According to MGM records it earned $2,893,000 in the US and Canada, and $1,087,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $1,895,000.

Smith House is a historic rowhouse at 25 Oliver Street in the Two Bridges section of Lower Manhattan. Probably built in the late 19th century, it was the home of four-time governor of New York State and 1928 Democratic presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith (1873-1944). Smith lived here from 1907 to 1923. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. With . Description and history The Alfred E. Smith House is an architecturally undistinguished three-story brick rowhouse, located on the west side of Oliver Street in Lower Manhattan, across the street from the Alfred E. Smith Elementary School. The building is three bays wide and crowned by a modillioned cornice. Its entrance is in the right bay, topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The interior retains a number of original period Victorian features, including tile floors and a stairway newel post, but also has alterations that were probably made during the period of Alfred E. Smith's occupancy, including the provision of glass-windowed doors between the main hall and front parlor. Based on stylisting evidence, the house was probably built between 1870 and 1890. Al Smith occupied this house, which he leased from the nearby St. James Church, from 1907 until 1923. His biographers describe this period as important in forming his political views and philosophy, which propelled him into the New York governorship beginning in 1919, and to is ultimately unsuccessful run for United States President in the 1928 election. Smith's rise on the national stage marked a trend away from rural or small-town figures in national politics, and toward figures with more urban experiences. He was ultimately hampered in his success on the national stage by his Roman Catholicism, and by a decade of post-World War I prosperity which had largely been overseen by Republican administrations. After Smith moved out of this building in 1923, it housed an undertaker until 1930. It was still owned by St. James Church, and occupied by a single tenant since 1930, at the time of its National Historic Landmark designation in 1972.

Biography  Herbert was born in Jo√£o Pessoa, Para√≠ba. His father was from the military and, because of that, he moved to Bras√≠lia when he was still a child. There he met band member Bi Ribeiro. When they moved to Rio de Janeiro, they formed Os Paralamas do Sucesso (some still consider them part of the \\"Bras√≠lia gang\\", along with Capital Inicial and Legi√£o Urbana) with their friend Vital Dias playing drums. Herbert's brother is the well-known Brazilian anthropologist and cultural researcher Hermano Vianna. After Vital was replaced by Jo√£o Barone, Herbert wrote the song \\"Vital e Sua Moto\\", to pay homage to his friend. The song became the band's first airplay hit and, shortly after that, they signed with EMI Music Group. After spending ten years with the band, Herbert released the solo album √ä Batumar√™ (1992). He recorded two others, Santorini Blues (1997) e O Som do Sim (2000), with C√°ssia Eller, Nana Caymmi, Sandra de S√° and Marcos Valle. Herbert married the British journalist Lucy Needham (a former BBC journalist whom he met when she came to interview him for a documentary), with whom he had three children: Luca, Hope and Phoebe. = 2001‚Äìpresent: tragedy and recovery = Herbert always liked to pilot helicopters and ultralight airplanes. On February 4, 2001, he suffered an accident in Mangaratiba, Rio de Janeiro, when the ultralight airplane he was piloting crashed into the sea, in the bay of Angra dos Reis. The accident killed his wife Lucy and put Herbert in the hospital for 44 days (part of them in a coma). The musician became disabled (he is now in a wheelchair) and lost part of his memory after the accident; however, after a slow recovery process, he returned to perform. Since the accident, Herbert has recorded four albums with Os Paralamas do Sucesso: Longo Caminho (2002), the live Uns Dias ao Vivo (2004), Hoje (2005) and Brasil Afora (2009).

He advanced to the Austin Senators of the Texas League in 1911, appearing in 37 games and compiling a 22-14 record with 311 innings pitched. He helped lead Austin to the 1911 Texas League pennant. The Houston Post picked him for its All-Texas team and noted: \\"Taylor of Austin is credited by the league batsmen as being the best of them all with the actual possession of the stuff on the ball. He was seldom bumped hard and was almost always a remarkably effective pitcher. Taylor has a varied assortment of curves and excellent control.\\" After an impressive season in Austin, Taylor was purchased by the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut on September 6, 1911. He appeared in three games for Detroit, two as a starter, and compiled a 0-2 record with a 3.79 ERA in 19 innings pitched.

He was appointed technical coordinator and manager for the 2018 Winter Olympics by the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (POCOG) http://www.hockeyfans.ch/news/datum/2014/12/4 in the field of ice hockey and ice sledge hockey. Playing career =Amateur= The son of Korean immigrants in Germany, Hyun began playing ice hockey at the age of 5, progressing his way through local youth leagues and into the Krefeld Pinguine's youth development system. He became a regular player for the German Junior National Team. In 1997 he was summoned by Coach Miroslav Berek and General Manager R√ºdiger Noack to begin the season with the Elite league team at the age of 17, where he scored two goals in five preseason games playing alongside former NHL player Peter Ihnaƒç√°k (Toronto Maple Leafs). Hyun played most of the season with the second-league development team . In 1998 Hyun decided to go to the United States to further his education and pursue his hockey career at the same time. He first studied at Benilde-St. Margaret's High School, a Catholic school in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, later transferring to Northwood Prep School in Lake Placid, New York. Soon after arriving in the United States, Hyun became a fan of National Hockey League player Paul Kariya who is of partial Japanese ancestry. After failing to be picked in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft during the World U-17 Championships in Moncton, Canada in 1997, Hyun put aside his pursuit of a professional NHL hockey career, and enrolled in Colchester, Vermont's Saint Michael's College, where he played NCAA Division II hockey. In 2002 Hyun won the ECAC Division II Northeast Championship with the Purple Knights. =Krefeld Pinguine= 2004‚Äì05 Upon graduation in 2003, he entered a masters' program at the University of Kent's Brussels campus; while a student, he also played for a Belgian Hockey League team in Leuven. He returned to Germany in 2004 to sign with the Krefeld Pinguine. With his signing Hyun became the first Asian to ever make it to the highest professional league in Germany. He made his league debut on September 17, 2004 against the Cologne Sharks. Hyun chose to wear Number 71 to honour the accomplishments of Korean guestworkers in Germany. In April 2005 Hyun was invited by German President Horst K√∂hler to attend the state banquet in honour of the state visit of South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun. Hyun is only the third player of Korean heritage to play in the highest league, the previous two being Jim Paek and Richard Park of the USA. Retirement After just one season, Hyun retired from professional ice hockey to move to South Korea, where he worked with the National Assembly and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to promote Korean- German friendship. Though Hyun sometimes faced racism and exclusion in Germany, he stated that he felt even more like a stranger in South Korea; he returned to Germany to enroll in a doctoral programme at the University of Bonn, where he is writing his thesis on the experiences of the second- generation Korean youth in Germany. He also gained more experience in the political world with the German and European Parliament and the Ministry of Generations, Family, Women and Integration. Career as author He has published a book entitled Lautlos-JA Sprachlos-NEIN (Silent-YES Speechless-NO) on the social integration experiences of second-generation Koreans in Germany. The book was published in 2008 by EB-Verlag Hamburg . In his highly acclaimed debut book Hyun was supported by his friend and bestselling author Wladimir Kaminer. They both performed together on stage at the Goethe-Institut in Seoul. Five years later Hyun published his second book with publishing power house Random House. The book was titled \\"Ohne Flei√ü kein Reis - wie ich ein guter Deutscher wurde http://www.randomhouse.de/Paperback/Ohne-Fleiss-kein- Reis-Wie-ich-ein-guter-Deutscher-wurde/Martin-Hyun/e394778.rhd\\". The author explores issues central to the Asian German experience: the encounter of diverse cultures; the challenges of racism, discrimination, and exclusion. The author above all raises the question of becoming and being German with \\"slanted\\" eyes. His special views on minorities and social integration has landed him a job with Germany's most influential political news broadcasting radio station \\"Deutschlandradio Kultur http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/kevin-prince-boateng-hat-ein-zeichen- gesetzt.1005.de.html?dram:article_id=237871\\" as columnist. Activism Hyun has become a vivid fighter for minority rights in Germany. In 2007 Hyun was selected among thirty young leaders with a foreign background to participate in the Bertelsmann-Foundation Leadership-Program in order to promote social integration of minorities in Germany. As a professional ice hockey player Hyun initiated a mentoring-project for children from low income families and helped children with cancer. On October 10, 2008 Hyun received a second invitation from German President Horst K√∂hler to talk about the demographic change and increasing diversity in Germany. Numerous visits from different Presidents followed. In 2008 Hyun was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for the European Year of the intercultural dialogue, sponsored by the European Commission and European Parliament.

CPS is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. Its volunteer instructors train recreational boaters in boating safety knowledge as well as their vessel handling and navigation skills. CPS offers boating safety courses yearly and provides qualification for the Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC). Its patron is HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[2]  History  Canadian Power Squadron was founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1938 after a group of boaters travelled to the Detroit Power Squadron to take the United States Power Squadrons Coastal Navigation Course. Upon their successful completion of the course, they formed the Windsor Power Squadron, closely followed by the formation of Squadrons in Sarnia, London and Toronto. CPS now has 166 Squadrons in all provinces and the Yukon Territory. CPS was incorporated in 1947, and in 1985 changed its name to Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons. At that time, the French name, Escadrilles canadiennes de plaisance was formally adopted.  Membership  Over 26,000 members volunteer their time for CPS to help promote the Boating and PCOC courses to the general public, and providing various services for the membership. Most of the volunteers are involved in boat training, developing and writing courses and instructing in classrooms across Canada. One who successfully completes either the CPS Boating Course (called Piloting until 1972) or the CPS PCOC Course becomes a member of the organization. Full members are then permitted to fly the CPS flag on their vessels and receive six issues of Canadian Yachting magazine, four of which contain the member publication, The Port Hole. In Quebec, members receive four issues of L'Escale Nautique magazine, which contain the French member publication, Le Hublot. The members also have the opportunity to take a number of advanced and elective courses. Throughout the years a number of member benefits have been developed, including the ability to purchase a CPS Members Insurance policy, which offers a discount based on the courses members have taken.  Courses  All CPS courses are theoretical (classroom-based), and are typically offered in the evenings at local high schools, libraries and community centres. Along with the CPS Boating Course and the CPS PCOC Course, there are a number of elective courses, which are open to both members and the public. These include topics such as Fundamentals of Weather, Global Weather, Marine Maintenance, Distress Signaling, Extended Cruising, Maritime Radio, and Seamanship Sail. There are also a number of electronic courses including, Finding Your Way With GPS, Navigating with GPS, Electronic Charting, Radar for Pleasure Craft, and Depth Sounder. CPS is constantly updating and developing courses for recreational boaters throughout Canada. CPS manages the Restricted Maritime Radio Operator's Course on behalf of Industry Canada. Advanced courses offered by CPS include Seamanship (formerly called Piloting), which prepares boaters for travel on Canada's great lakes. Advance Piloting delves into subjects that include more information on tides and currents to prepare boaters for ocean travel. There is also a Celestial Navigation Course for instruction in navigating by the stars. For the volunteers who serve the organization, CPS offers Officer Training and Instructor Development programs. Many of the courses offered by CPS enhance members' expertise in their private lives as well.  Organization  CPS offers its members volunteer opportunities such as instructing or proctoring local classes or taking a position on the Squadron Executive Committee. Members can also volunteer at the District and National level by serving on a variety of committees, which are responsible for training, public relations, marine reporting, environmental issues, publications, communications, conferences and meetings, development of Port Captains, membership, and other areas. CPS holds a National Conference, rotating to a different region in Canada each year, at which it recognizes its various partners and offers a variety of seminars on new developments.

He was a noted community leader, philanthropist, and humanitarian. He was inducted into the Order of Canada for his work towards ridding the world of landmines, and was later made an officer of the order. Early life Schwartz was born in New Waterford, Nova Scotia to Abraham and Rose Schwartz, an Ashkenazi Jewish family originally from the Pale of Settlement. They had a small clothing store on Plummer Avenue, the town's main street. After completing grade 11 at Mount Carmel School, Schwartz left high school to attend courses at Mount Allison University and New York University. Upon his return to Cape Breton, in the early 1950s, he became a manager in his parents‚Äô store. In 1955, at the age of 26, Schwartz became the president and general manager of Schwartz and Company. Over the next 30 years, he used this business as his base to go into other businesses and conduct philanthropic work. Business career Starting in the 1960s, he began investing in business ventures outside of the furniture and clothing businesses. He branched out into long-term care, by opening his first nursing home in Sydney, Nova Scotia. This operation was amalgamated with a Calgary company to form VillaCentres Limited. The newly combined company built nine nursing homes across the country and controlled the Park Plaza Hotel, in downtown Toronto. In the 1970s, when Cape Breton's economy was starting to unravel, with the Sydney Steel Corporation shedding jobs, and the coal mines around Industrial Cape Breton being slowly shutdown by DEVCO, Schwartz tried to help Cape Breton's economy by investing in diverse businesses that were outside of the traditional heavy-industrial types that were the norm at the time, for example, seafood farming. In 1976, he entered the cable television field by gaining a licence for the cable franchise in the Glace Bay and New Waterford areas, known as Seaside Cable TV Ltd (now known as Seaside Communications). With its sister company, Seaside High-Speed, it is currently providing high- speed wireless internet throughout the rural areas of eastern Nova Scotia. Philanthropic work From an early age he was involved with New Waterford's volunteer fire department, and ran blood donation drives.

It was included in his 1842 collection of Poems. Tennyson wrote the poem, titled \\"Thoughts of a Suicide\\" in manuscript, after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam in 1833. The poem was autobiographical. Background Tennyson explained, \\"When I wrote 'The Two Voices' I was so utterly miserable, a burden to myself and to my family, that I said, 'Is life worth anything?'\\" (Hill, 54). In the poem, one voice urges the other to suicide (\\"There is one remedy for all\\" repeated on lines 201 and 237); the poet's arguments against it range from vanity to desperation, yet the voice discredits all. The poem's ending delivers no conclusions, and has been widely criticized‚Äîthe poet finds no internal affirmation, invoking \\"solace outside himself\\" (Tucker). \\"The Two Voices\\" was published following a ten-year span (1832-1842) in which Tennyson did not publish anything, coinciding with what some call \\"one of the deafening silences of Victorian literary history\\" Analysis =Poetic structure= The poem is written in Iambic tetrameter with a rhyme scheme consisting of tercets (three lines of matching end rhyme). It is 205 stanzas long (615 lines). It was praised for its depth and style. The poem is believed to have been written in an experimental form of poetic dialogue: \\"Tennyson's chief purpose in writing the poem: the creation of a sustained poetic dialogue‚Äîthe exploration of a road ultimately not taken in Tennyson's career.\\" The poem follows the poet's struggle to argue convincingly against the voice that suggests suicide, which twice in the poem declares that \\"there is one remedy for all\\": Then comes the check, the change, the fall, Pain rises up, old pleasures pall, There is one remedy for all. (ll. 163-165) \\"Cease to wail and brawl! Why inch by inch to darkness crawl? There is one remedy for all.‚Äù ((ll. 199-201) Response \\"The Two Voices\\" attracted the attention of scholar Herbert Spencer, who believed some of the theories between the poem and his own book, The Principles of Psychology, were interconnected. Jerome Buckley asserted that the poem is \\"tinged with Satanic irony\\", and \\"the voice of negation, cynical and realistic, puncturing a desperate idealism, forced upon the reluctant ego an awareness of man‚Äôs fundamental insignificance\\" and that it \\"remains intense as the colloquy of denial with doubt in the dark night of the soul\\". Basil Willey claimed: \\"Tennyson, in my view, should not be blamed‚Ä¶for failing to find a solution where no solution exists; nor should he be accused of wishful thinking when he asserts... that the Heart has its reasons of which Reason knows nothing.\\" William R. Brashear's \\"Tennyson's Third Voice: A Note\\" points out that the argument is between \\"Dionysian\\" (emotional human nature) and \\"Socratic\\" (intellectual) voices. The Dionysian (\\"the still small voice\\") is of conscious, subjective fact. It \\"does not call upon the poet to reason, only to see that \\"it were better not to be\\". The Socratic voice, whose \\"optimistic arguments are all objective\\", \\"utilizes a full assortment of rationales ranging from scientific faith in progress to Platonic ideas of immortality. But...it is feeble and impotent against the subjective fact.\\" The third voice is \\"hopeful rather than optimistic\\" and \\"simply bolsters the poet against the overpowering vision of futility\\". The poem has also received quite a bit of criticism as one of Tennyson's less impressive poems. Published after a ten- year dry spell, being a more experimental poem for Tennyson, there are those who believe it does not exemplify his poetic genius as well as some of his other pieces. \\"The Two Voices\\" has been criticized as unnecessarily long and lacking any sort of literary resolution, that it \\"seems to be one of those works whose end cycles back to the beginning\\" The ambiguity between all the voices involved has been considered to be too much for even the experienced reader to interpret and the meaning is too difficult to decipher.

The word lapa is an indigenous Southern African Sotho and Tswana word. There are two ways of referring to this word, one way of referring to it is lapa, and another way is lelapa. In other words, the two words i.e. lapa and lelapa, can be used interchangeably. The word lapa can be translated into English as the word, yard (a house and the land attached), or as the word, family. To the Western or Asian mind, this may not make sense, but in most indigenous Southern African languages, the word for yard (a house and the land attached), and the word for family, is the same word. Culturally and linguistically, a lapa means several things. It means a family, the land on which the family lives, and also, specifically, the area right in front of the house as one steps out of the door. The lapa area is usually painted and decorated with traditional colours, and also decked with plants, and spiritually significant flowers. Also, in most cases, even a shrine to the great African ancestors is usually set up at one of the corners of the lapa. Traditionally, the family, or the lapa would gather here (on the lapa) for breakfast, lunch, supper, and to host guests. During important family events, the family usually gathers here in the lapa to commune with the family's great ancestors and to pour libations of traditional morula wine and mabele beer to them. The area would usually have a high thatched roof supported by wooden poles. The lapa may be attached to the main house or may be a separate structure altogether, a few meters away from the house. Traditionally, there can be more than one lapa in a single yard. In some homes, there are lapas for the elders, and lapas for the younger relatives of the family. During weddings and other celebrations, temporary lapas may be constructed to cater for the extra guests which will be present. Some of the temporary lapas may also be used as kitchen areas or dining halls for the extra cooking and dining which would be taking place at such events. Recently, lapas have become a significant part of South Africa's modern architecture, and they're now added in urban developments. Lapas have also become a normal sight at most of South Africa's lodges and guest houses. They have gained popularity and are now used as entertainment areas for braais (barbecues), house and kiddies parties.

Location The Beattie Park Mound Group is located in downtown Rockford, Illinois' Beattie Park. It consists of three conical mounds (one outside the park boundaries), an effigy mound in the shape of a turtle, and a linear mound.Rohrbough, p. 15. Beattie Park is north of Park Avenue and south of Mound Avenue, but there is one mound remnant in front of the house at 509 Indian Terrace. On its west, the park is bounded by Main Street and to its east lies the Rock River. Mounds are the most visible evidence of cultures that lived for hundreds of years in the mix of biomes in northern Illinois.Rohrbough, pp. 19-23. Mound groups in eastern North America are primarily located along waterways, as is the case with the Beattie Park Mounds. Effigy (animal-shaped) mounds are found in Wisconsin and adjoining parts of neighboring states south of the conifer hardwood forests and stretch from eastern Iowa to Lake Michigan History The linear mound of the Beattie Park Group. The mounds and mound remnants in Beattie Park date from an era during the Late Woodland known as the Effigy mound Period. This period spanned from about 700-1100 C.E. in the Upper Mississippi River Valley in parts of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Native American Mound builders were not a single culture but several groups that interacted and made artifacts and structures such as mounds in similar ways. The mounds in Beattie Park probably date from the early part of the time period 700-1100, when most of the effigy mounds seem to have been built. The grouping represents the remnants of a cluster that originally included nine conical mounds, a linear mound, an earthen embankment, and two effigy mounds: a bird and a turtle.Rohrbough, p. 3. Through the years, some of the mounds were destroyed or disturbed. When Sears now the home of Rockford Art Museum constructed a parking lot on North Main Street in the mid-1950s one of the conical mounds was destroyed. A bird effigy was destroyed when the North Main Manor apartment building was under construction across Park Avenue from the mounds.

He rose from private soldier in World War I to air marshal in 1948, and served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1942 to 1952, the longest continuous tenure of any RAAF chief. Jones was a surprise appointee to the Air Force's top role, and his achievements in the position were coloured by a divisive relationship during World War II with his nominal subordinate, the head of RAAF Command, Air Vice- Marshal William Bostock. During World War I, Jones saw action as an infantryman in the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915, before transferring to the Australian Flying Corps a year later. Originally a mechanic, he undertook flying training in 1917 and was posted to a fighter squadron in France. He achieved seven victories to become an ace, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. After a short spell in civilian life following World War I, he joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921, and rose steadily through training and personnel commands prior to World War II. Jones did not actively seek the position of Chief of the Air Staff before being appointed in 1942, and his conflict with Bostock‚Äîwith whom he had been friends for 20 years‚Äîwas partly the result of a divided command structure, which neither man had any direct role in shaping. After World War II, Jones had overall responsibility for transforming what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a peacetime service that was also able to meet overseas commitments in Malaya and Korea. Following his retirement from the RAAF, he continued to serve in the aircraft industry and later ran unsuccessfully for political office. He was knighted in 1953. Early life George Jones was born on 18 October 1896 near Rushworth, a rural community in Victoria. The date appearing on his birth certificate was the day of registration, 22 November. His father, a miner, had died in an accident three months before the birth, leaving his family in poverty. The youngest of ten children, Jones was brought up in a strict Methodist household and for his entire life rarely touched alcohol. He attended Rushworth State School, and completed his education at the age of 14 with a Certificate of Merit.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 1-3 Following his schooling, Jones took an apprenticeship as a carpenter before moving to Melbourne, where he became a motor mechanic. He worked in several garages before commencing a part-time course in fitting and turning at the Working Men's College of Melbourne. His college studies were curtailed by the outbreak of World War I, by which time he had accumulated three years part-time military service, firstly in cadets and later in a militia unit, the 29th Light Horse Regiment. World War I Snipe of No. 4 Squadron AFC, c. 1918 In May 1915 Jones joined the Australian Imperial Force, embarking for Egypt in August with the 9th Light Horse Regiment. He landed at Gallipoli the following month and served there until the end of the campaign in December. His experiences at Gallipoli, especially witnessing the death by enemy fire of one of his friends, affected him deeply and he suffered from headaches and nightmares for years afterwards. After briefly transferring to the Imperial Camel Corps, Jones applied to join the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in October 1916, taking a drop in rank from corporal to private to do so.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 4‚Äì8 Jones became an air mechanic in No. 1 Squadron AFC (known as No. 67 Squadron Royal Flying Corps by the British), before being accepted for flying training in England. He gained his wings on 22 November 1917 and was posted to No. 4 Squadron AFC (also known as No. 71 Squadron RFC) as a second lieutenant in January the following year. Flying Sopwith Camels and Snipes on the Western Front, Jones finished the war a captain and an ace, with seven aerial victories from 150 patrols. He was badly injured by a bullet wound and petrol burns in combat with a German fighter in March 1918, and did not return to his unit for three months.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, p. 239 On 29 October 1918 he achieved two kills in one engagement, at Tournai, in what is frequently described as \\"one of the greatest air battles of the war\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 21Odgers, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 42‚Äì43Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 377‚Äì378 Amid a confrontation involving over 75 Allied and German fighters, Jones led his patrol of three Snipes in a dive on ten Fokkers, destroying a brace of enemy aircraft in the attack. He was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross for displaying \\"the greatest daring and ability in aerial fighting\\"; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 5 April 1919. Inter-war years Roy King (second right), with other pilots of No. 4 Squadron AFC, British Occupation forces in Germany, December 1918 Jones remained with the Australian Flying Corps until June 1919, as part of the British Occupation forces in Germany. After returning to Australia he worked as a turner in Melbourne. He married Muriel Cronan, a clerk who also played piano professionally, on 15 November 1919. They had met prior to the war and kept in touch throughout Jones' overseas postings. The couple's first child, Ronald, arrived on 2 October 1920. A second son, Ian, would be born on 26 June 1934. Jones was described by family members as being a somewhat distant husband and father, dedicated to his career and rarely given to obvious displays of emotion.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 14‚Äì15, 23 Encouraged by a fellow No. 4 Squadron veteran, Harry Cobby, Jones applied to join the new Australian Air Force on 22 March 1921 (the prefix \\"Royal\\" was added that August). His rank was flying officer, one below the equivalent of his AFC rank of captain. Another Australian pilot joining the fledgling Air Force was William (Bill) Bostock, a lieutenant in World War I. The pair became firm friends, Bostock acting as something of a mentor to the younger officer.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 116‚Äì119Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 16‚Äì21 Jones was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1923. Nicknamed \\"Jonah\\",Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 151‚Äì152 he was also known as \\"Yellow Jones\\" in his early days with the RAAF, not through any perceived lack of moral fibre but as a result of the lingering effects on his skin of jaundice, contracted while a soldier at Gallipoli. Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put in charge of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly regarded for his technical and administrative ability but rated only \\"average\\" in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, \\"The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as fast as I could, but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder.\\"Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 90 As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.Air Power Development Centre, \\"The Difference One Man Makes\\" Returning to Australia in October 1930, Jones was made Chief Flying Instructor at Point Cook and Officer Commanding No. 1 FTS. He became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in November 1931. On 2 April 1932, he was taking off from Mascot, New South Wales, in a de Havilland Moth when he struck the perimeter fence and crashed, resulting in major damage to the aircraft and injuries to himself and his passenger.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 323 His performance in the early 1930s was highly regarded by his superiors, regularly being assessed as \\"above average\\" or \\"exceptional\\".Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 22‚Äì23 From late 1934 to early 1935, he collaborated with the Director of Equipment, George Mackinolty, on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan. Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel, Bill Anderson, it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 445 In January 1936, Jones was promoted to wing commander and appointed Director of Personnel Services. World War II =Rise to Chief of the Air Staff= Bill Bostock (centre) and outgoing CAS Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, May 1942 Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, on 1 December 1939, Jones was raised to temporary group captain.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 26 In March 1940, he returned to the position of Director of Training and assumed responsibility for Australia's part in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), establishing many schools, acquiring hundreds of aircraft, and overseeing the training of thousands of airmen. The RAAF's Central Flying School was reformed in April 1940 to meet the vital requirement for additional flying instructors, whose numbers would grow from 16 in the first year of the war to 3,600 by 1945.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 67‚Äì68 His performance in this role led to Jones being promoted to acting air commodore on 21 February 1941, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1942 New Year Honours for \\"diligence, devotion to duty and perseverance of outstanding merit\\".Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 42‚Äì44 On 5 May 1942, Jones was appointed Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. He was considered an unlikely choice, a contemporary newspaper describing him as \\"the darkest of dark horses\\".Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 76‚Äì77 Jones was still only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore when he succeeded to the role, leapfrogging several more senior officers including his friend Bill Bostock, now an air vice-marshal and Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 475‚Äì477 Bostock, thought to be \\"among the Air Force's best brains\\" at the time,Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 446 was believed by himself (and Jones) to be the leading candidate for the position. The suggestion even arose that Jones' selection was a mistake, based on the government's reading of an organisation chart that implied he was the RAAF's most senior officer after Bostock, when in fact he was ranked six places below. Other potential appointees had included Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice-Marshal Peter Drummond. Williams, however, had been out of favour since his dismissal from the position of CAS in the wake of the Ellington Report criticising RAAF flying safety in 1939, while Drummond was not released from his position as Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAF Middle East.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 113‚Äì116Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 64‚Äì68 Bostock was first choice of the incumbent CAS, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, but the latter's ill-concealed contempt for John Curtin's Federal Labor government helped ensure that his preference was ignored. Although he admitted to being \\"stunned\\" by the decision, Jones himself had the ambition and a reasonable expectation of becoming CAS at some point in his career; it simply happened \\"much sooner than I anticipated\\". Jones had proved his organisational abilities directing EATS, and believed that this was a significant factor in his appointment. His working class origin has also been cited as contributing to his suitability to a Labor government.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 68, 74 =Divided command= Jones shortly after he was appointed CAS, May 1942 Passed over as CAS, Bostock subsequently became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAAF Command, which placed him in charge of Australian air operations in the Pacific. Jones' role, in contrast, was primarily administrative, that of \\"raising, training and maintaining\\" the service.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 120‚Äì123 Though the CAS was de jure head of the RAAF, Jones' new rank of air vice- marshal was the same as Bostock's. In the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, \\"Jones was the head of his service, but he was neither unambiguously its senior officer, nor presiding over a unified command ... The system of divided command... was not an ideal arrangement, but with men of goodwill it could have worked. Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind...\\" Friction between the two senior officers over the command structure rapidly deteriorated into a state of \\"complete obduracy\\", and remained so until the end of the war.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 595‚Äì596 As a direct report to the USAAF's Lieutenant-General George Kenney, commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), Bostock was able to ignore many directives from Jones, his nominal superior in the RAAF.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 128, 132, 159 The CAS nevertheless continued to assert his authority over Bostock's supplies of manpower and equipment. In March 1943 Jones proposed that he take over responsibility for air operations in defence of the Australian mainland but General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander SWPA, refused to countenance it.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 140n The next month, with the support of the Australian Air Board, Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command and replace him with Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, AOC No. 9 Operational Group (No. 9 OG). Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command and threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government. MacArthur subsequently told Prime Minister Curtin that Hewitt \\"was not an adequate replacement\\" for Bostock, and the matter was dropped.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 123‚Äì126 Six months later Jones would sack Hewitt over morale issues in No. 9 OG raised during the offensive on Rabaul; Kenney called Hewitt's removal \\"bad news\\". Jones (right) with members of HQ Allied Air Forces SWPA, including Group Captains Allan Walters (second left) and Val Hancock (centre) and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt (second right), 1942 Jones himself came under threat of transfer or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 165‚Äì172Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 15‚Äì17 In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. By June 1944 the Jones‚ÄìBostock conflict and the anomalous division of administrative and operational responsibilities again led the Australian government to consider the appointment of a new commander senior to both officers. Air Marshal Sir Keith Park, the New Zealand-born AOC of No. 11 Group RAF during the Battle of Britain, was sought for the position but negotiations were broken off when MacArthur advised that it was too late to make such a change and that the problem had now gone \\"quiet\\". That it was far from over was apparent in a series of cables exchanged between the two air vice-marshals in January 1945. Jones sent a signal to Bostock complaining of the latter's \\"insubordinate tone\\" and \\"repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters\\". Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was \\"responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you\\", and that he would \\"continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference\\".Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 436‚Äì437 Despite such acrimony, the command structure remained unchanged for the rest of the war. Responsible as CAS for building up Australia's air combat assets, in 1943 Jones had given an assurance to the Australian government that he could maintain a force of 73 squadrons, despite Kenney's prediction that even the RAAF's then-currently approved strength of 45 squadrons was beyond its capacity.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 12 In the event, by the end of the war Jones had expanded the RAAF to 70 squadrons in the Pacific and Europe, including several heavy bomber units. One of his most controversial decisions of the war was during the invasion of Tarakan in May 1945 when he grounded Australian B-24 Liberator squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack, due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted, and said that he would have thankfully \\"fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck\\" as he watched the attacking formations from a U.S. warship, minus the expected RAAF aircraft. Kenney sympathised with him; he once commented in his diary that \\"Jones and Bostock ... fight each other harder than the Japs\\". =The \\"Morotai Mutiny\\"= Jones (left) and Lieutenant General George Kenney (right) in Manila, July 1945 Towards the end of the war Jones intervened in the so-called \\"Morotai Mutiny\\", when senior pilots in the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No. 1 TAF) proffered their resignations rather than carry on attacking what they saw as unimportant targets. Jones personally interviewed all but one of the officers involved, later declaring, \\"I believed them all to be sincere in what they were stating and what they had attempted to do ... Yes, sincerely held beliefs, no matter how ill-founded, coupled possibly with a rather exaggerated sense of national duty.\\"Alexander, \\"Cleaning the augean stables\\" Kenney also insisted on speaking to the pilots himself, overriding Jones' protestations that it was an internal RAAF matter, and threatened to appear on behalf of the pilots should they be court- martialled. Jones sacked the Air Officer Commanding No. 1 TAF, his former No. 4 Squadron comrade Harry Cobby, along with two of Cobby's staff. In what may have been a reaction to Kenney's threat, Jones insisted that the subsequent inquiry before Justice John Vincent Barry focus not only on the attempted resignations but on reports of alcohol trafficking on Morotai. While no action was taken against the pilots over the mutiny directly, two of the RAAF's best- known aces, Group Captain Clive Caldwell and Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes, were court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced in rank. Although Barry did not find it a significant factor, the Jones‚ÄìBostock conflict was also blamed for contributing to the poor morale that precipitated the \\"mutiny\\".Stanley, Tarakan: An Australian Tragedy, p. 41 One of the other participants, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry: \\"I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it.\\" Post-war career =The \\"Interim Air Force\\"= Jones (back, middle) and Bostock (front, right) with General Sir Thomas Blamey (front, centre) and other Australian delegates at the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri, September 1945 Along with Bostock, Jones represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri in September 1945.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 208 With Jones' concurrence, Bostock and other senior commanders were summarily retired in 1946, in Bostock's case for \\"inability to work in harmony with certain other high ranking RAAF officers\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 179Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 237‚Äì240 The CAS oversaw planning for the demobilisation of thousands of RAAF personnel and the creation of a peacetime service, known as the \\"Interim Air Force\\". When he was eventually promoted air marshal in 1948 the RAAF was made up of approximately 8,000 staff, compared to 175,000‚Äîthe world's fourth largest air force‚Äîhe had commanded in 1945 as air vice- marshal.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 170‚Äì171, 179Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 190 Believing that wastage was reaching a critical point, Jones proposed recruiting women into a new service to replace the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force that had been disbanded in September 1946. Blocked initially by the Labor government of the day, it came into being in 1950 as the Women's Royal Australian Air Force, following the election of Robert Menzies' Liberal Party in December 1949.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 203‚Äì205 Concurrently with demobilisation, Jones shaped the RAAF's \\"Plan D\\", adopted in 1947. It outlined the service's post-war organisation and requirements, which included 16 squadrons flying technologically advanced aircraft. This basic structure remained in place for the next 20 years.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 221‚Äì222Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. xvi‚Äìxvii, 303‚Äì304 In 1949, Jones visited the UK with a team of advisors and recommended the English Electric Canberra jet to replace the RAAF's Avro Lincoln piston-engined bombers.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 346, 363 Entering service in 1953, the Canberras ultimately equipped three Squadrons, operating with distinction in the Vietnam War and continuing to fly until 1982. Other enduring types purchased under Jones' tenure as CAS included the CAC Sabre, P-2 Neptune and CAC Winjeel. He still enjoyed flying and made an effort to pilot each new type as it entered service, including the de Havilland Vampire jet, but his irregular turns in the cockpit meant that his skills were generally found wanting.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, p. 96Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 243 =Overseas commitments and retirement from RAAF= Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson (second left), General Douglas MacArthur (second right) and Air Marshal Jones (far right) in Japan after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 When Australia committed forces to the Malayan Emergency in April 1950, Jones grouped the requisite RAAF assets under one overarching organisation, No. 90 (Composite) Wing, to ensure they would operate with some autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied services as had been the case in World War II, when Australian units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF. He also proposed that the officer commanding all Commonwealth air force units should be from the RAAF; this was agreed by the British Air Ministry, and the position later gave valuable experience to two future Chiefs of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshals Frederick Scherger and Val Hancock. Jones allocated No. 77 Squadron, then based in Japan as part of British Commonwealth Occupation Force, to the United Nations Command when the Korean War broke out. Prime Minister Menzies rang Jones at home on Saturday, 1 July 1950, requesting a squadron and the unit went into action the following day.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 274‚Äì275 Almost immediately that Menzies' Liberal Party replaced the Chifley Labor government at the end of 1949, it had begun to investigate possible replacements (largely from the RAF) for the incumbent CAS, eventually deciding on Air Marshal (later Air Chief Marshal) Sir Donald Hardman. Jones was informed of his retirement, which he claimed to have been expecting, in December 1951. In a farewell speech at the Australia Club in Melbourne, attended by Menzies, Jones said that organising EATS and expanding the Air Force in the South West Pacific had been his greatest achievements. His official exit from RAAF was on 22 February 1952. The Prime Minister sent him a letter thanking him for his \\"valuable contribution\\", which would \\"long be remembered\\".Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 290‚Äì297 Later life Following his departure from the Air Force in 1952, Jones became Director of Coordination with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and member of the board of Ansett Transport Industries. In the 1953 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his military service. He retired from the CAC directorship in 1957 but remained on the Ansett board until the early 1970s. Jones pursued a political career in parallel to his aviation industry work, unsuccessfully standing for Liberal Party pre-selection in the seat of Flinders in 1952. In 1958, he left the Liberals in favour of the Labor Party, contesting the seat of Henty at the 1961 federal election.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, p. 70Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 182 He switched parties as his views were too leftist for the Liberals, declaring \\"They got rather nasty with me and wouldn't give me a fair go, so I resigned and joined the Labor Party\\". He pursued an energetic campaign in Henty, but lost to his Liberal opponent by fewer than 3,000 primary votes.Coulthard-Clark, Soldiers in Politics, p. 135 Jones left the Labor Party in 1965 due to dissatisfaction with its aviation policy. In 1967, he contested the Corio by-election as a candidate of the Liberal Reform Group, running as an opponent of the Vietnam War. He was unsuccessful, polling 1.8 percent of the primary vote. Jones also evinced an interest in unidentified flying objects, having first encountered unexplained aerial phenomena at Warrnambool, Victoria, in 1930. He reported witnessing another UFO in October 1957, but admitted that he was \\"loath to talk about it publicly lest people should think I was either an incompetent witness or getting a little screwy in the head\\". In the mid-1960s he patronised the Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation and joined the Victorian UFO Research Society. Jones published his autobiography, From Private to Air Marshal, in 1988. He was Australia's last surviving World War I ace when he died in Melbourne on 24 August 1992, aged 95.Franks, Sopwith Camel Aces of World War 1, p. 75 Legacy Jones' ten years as CAS constituted the longest continuous term of any RAAF chief. Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams' thirteen years as head of the RAAF comprised three separate terms, the longest of which was eight years. Despite his longevity in the position, he is still primarily known for two events early in his tenure, the surprise circumstance of his appointment, and his feud with Bill Bostock that lasted until the end of World War II.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. ii‚Äìxv, 299 The conflict between its two senior officers has been labelled \\"disastrous\\" for the RAAF, one that \\"diminished its standing\\" in the eyes of its Allies.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 123‚Äì125Horner, \\"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\\", p. 13 Jones claimed in his autobiography that he had never intrigued for the role of CAS and would have worked loyally for Bostock if the latter had been appointed. Air Vice-Marshal George Jones pictured shortly after the end of World War II, August 1945 Beyond these controversies, Jones significantly influenced the Air Force's development during and after the war. He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940‚Äì42 and has received credit as CAS for building up the RAAF's strength to 70 squadrons by 1945. After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of RAAF College, along similar lines to Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Royal Australian Naval College, as well as the RAAF Staff College. One of his last directions as CAS was the formation of RAAF Museum at Point Cook, where it is still based. Jones encouraged local industry to design and build trainers for the RAAF and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This led to the Winjeel basic trainer and Australian industry co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre and Canberra jets; such local participation has continued to figure in major RAAF aircraft acquisitions.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 188 He refused to update the command structure of the Air Force from one based on region to one of function, something his successor, Air Marshal Hardman, would accomplish, and has been criticised for a systemic resistance to change.Helson, Ten Years at the Top, pp. 253‚Äì254 Jones was described in David Horner's The Commanders as \\"a steady, sincere but colourless leader\\",Horner, The Commanders, p. 305 while Alan Stephens found him \\"a good and decent man, who had overcome considerable personal hardship in his youth to achieve exceptional professional success\\" but \\"neither an inspiring leader, nor a notable thinker\\". Nevertheless, his Plan D for the RAAF's post-war organisation remained the service's blueprint until the early 1970s.

He spent over twenty years in the American Soccer League, twice earning league MVP recognition. In 1949, he earned four caps with the U.S. national team. In addition to playing professional soccer, Hynes was a New York City fireman from 1947 to 1975 and served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Playing career Hynes emigrated to the United States from Scotland when he was thirteen years old. When he arrived in the U.S., he entered Curtis High School on Staten Island, New York. He played on the Curtis soccer team, spending two seasons as the team captain. However, he did not confine himself to high school soccer, but also played for the professional Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic of the American Soccer League (ASL). In 1938, Brooklyn went to the National Challenge Cup where the team lost the home and away series to Chicago Sparta, 8-0 on aggregate. Hynes came on as a substitute in the game in Chicago.Litterer, Dave & Goloboy, Jim. \\"USA - List of US Open Cup Finals\\" . RSSSF, December 13, 2012. Retrieved on June 5, 2013. After the National Cup, Hynes moved to Swedish F.C. which played in the National Soccer League of New York. In 1940, Swedish F.C. won both the league and cup titles. They repeated the cup title in 1941, the same year that Hynes moved back to the ASL where he joined the New York Americans. While Hynes began his career as an amateur, he received a nominal payment for games and in 1939 the president of USSF declared Hynes and fellow Swedish F.C. player, Gene Olaff, to be professionals. Hynes spent only two years with the Americans before joining the U.S. Army's 80th Division during World War II. Despite significant wounds received during the Battle of the Bulge, Hynes recovered and rejoined the Americans with whom he played until 1952. He then signed with Brookhattan, but in 1954, he moved across town to Brooklyn Hakoah. In 1956, he was named the ASL MVP. The next season, Hakoah won the ASL championship. Despite these achievements, Hynes moved back to Brookhattan in 1957. He was once again the league MVP and second on the league's scoring list. In 1959, Hynes made one last move, this time to Colombo, an expansion ASL club in Brooklyn. Hynes both played and coached Colombo, but the team lasted only the 1959-1960 season before folding. Despite being a first year team, Colombo won the ASL championship. By this time Hynes legs were failing and a fifth operation on his knees led him to retire from playing professionally. National team Hynes earned four caps with the U.S. national team when he was selected for the squad which competed in the 1949 NAFC Championship.Courtney, Barrie. \\"World Cup 1950 - Qualifying\\".

The U.S. finished second out of the three teams and qualified for the World Cup finals. However, Hynes was not selected for the finals team after the New York Times published remarks Hynes had made criticizing USSF's player selection process. Post-playing career After retiring from playing, Hynes was both a high school and collegiate referee and coach. His coaching stints included Wagner College.

Based on the tale of La Llorona, it tells of a family that is cursed by the evil spirit of Luisa, this story's \\"weeping woman\\". The film was filmed on location in Guanajuato, Mexico. Plot In 20th century Mexico, newly wed couple Felipe (Mauricio Garc√©s) and Margarita (Luz Mar√≠a Aguilar) are visited by Margarita's father, Don Gerardo Montes (Carlos L√≥pez Moctezuma), who tells them the story of La Llorona. In 16th century Mexico, an Indian and Spanish woman named Luisa is visited by an upper class Spanish conquistador named Don Nu√±o de Montesclaros (Eduardo Farjado). She falls in love with the man so much so that she leaves her life to start anew with Don Nu√±o. Don Nu√±o and Luisia have a boy and girl. However, Don Nu√±o leaves, as he must go on missions. Days later she is visited by one of Nu√±o's fellow conquistadors. He tells her that Don Nu√±o will not return home for a long time due to his duties. Suspicious, she follows the conquistador and comes to a palace where she finds Don Nu√±o. He explains that he will marry a new woman since Luisa is not fully Spanish. Enraged and heartbroken, she curses Don Nu√±o and his descendants that all his bloodline's firstborn will be murdered violently. When she returns home, she stabs her own children to death. The entire town finds out and Luisa is sentenced to death. Gerardo finishes the story and says that Margarita's brother was murdered violently when he was four because he was a firstborn. Felipe passes the story off as just a folktale but the house is then visited by a woman in a black cloak who is taking up the job of a nanny for Felipe and Margarita's newborn baby. Luisa (under the alias \\"Carmen Asiul\\") is accepted but secretly plans on murdering the baby. She tries killing the baby many times but is unsuccessful with each attempt. Gerardo is suspicious of the new nanny since he feels he has seen her before but cannot make out where. One night Felipe and Margarita decide to go out, leaving only Luisa and Gerardo home. Luisa is prepared to kill the baby using the very dagger with which she killed her own children. Gerardo realizes that it is Luisa and rushes to the baby's bedroom. Luisa is somehow pulled back and as Gerardo opens the door, he finds that Luisa has vanished and the dagger is impaled on the ground. With the baby safe, the parents home, and Luisa's ghost gone, Gerardo burns the dagger and the drawing of Luisa in a fire. He realizes that the curse under which his family had suffered for years is finally gone. Cast Production This is a literal retelling of the legend of La Llorona (the crying woman), present in many Latin American countries, a symbol of the native woman who betrayed her people by becoming the mistress of a conquistador, and a bad mother ‚Äì in this case, a very bad mother, \\"a la Medea\\"‚Äì who kills the children she had with her Spanish conquistador lover. Taking parts from Carmen Toscano's stage play, the film is set in contemporary M√©xico, but flashbacks a few centuries to tell Llorona's sad story. She is now the nanny of the grandson of a descendant of those who punished her, and plans to kill their Child. One curious detail (typical of Mexican horror films): the part of the little boy, Jorgito, is played by a girl. Mar√≠a Elena Marqu√©s leads a cast of distinguished Spanish performers.

The current director of INSF is Dr. Eaman Eftekhari (as 2019). Dr. Mohammad Farhadi was the first director of INSF served from 2002 to Feb 2011 followed by Dr. Nosratoallh Zargham. Introduction As a consequence of fast development in science and technology and the role of knowledge-based economy in global changes, it is predicted that the chief rulers of the world in future would be those nations and governments which have had the greatest contribution in planning supporting and financing science, technology and researches. With the vast horizon of the supreme leader of The Islamic Republic of Iran about science and research, as a result of the request of a group of scholars and thinkers of university and Hozeh (religious academies) on Oct. 7th, 2003, he (the supreme leader) ordered the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution to prepare the grounds for backing production of scientific software, and also to institutionalize scientific space of the country. Thereby, by proposition of the Council of Scientific Researches of Iran, and in order to fulfill the 4th paragraph of the 3rd article of the Constitution, and according to the sixth paragraph of the act about \\"The position, Objectives, and Responsibilities of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution\\", the council ratified the charter for Iran National Science Foundation, in its five hundred and twenty second session on 18 Feb 2003. This foundation was established with the purpose of supplying researchers' welfare, organizing generation of science and technology, preparing executive grounds in the country for directing research and technological proceeds towards people, and permanent development of the country. Iran National Science Foundation is a legally independent governmental institute, which is administered by a board of trustees. It is located in presidential institute. The assets of this foundation are supplied via governmental aids, bank facilities, investments of its own surplus assets, receiving financially and non-financially from true or legal persons. President of the foundation has the highest position in INSF, and the board's approval and under the order of the chairman of the board of trustees he will preside over the foundation for a four-year period of time. The current president of the foundation is Dr. Mohammad Farhadi. In Iran, the foundation supports those who have been described in accordance with the countries needs and priorities. The source for defining research priorities is the book about research priorities which is published by the national Scientific Research Council.

The school had its genesis in 1657 when Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628‚Äì1700), second head of the Mito Domain, commissioned the compilation of the Dai Nihonshi. Among scholars gathered for the project were Asaka Tanpaku (1656‚Äì1737), Sassa Munekiyo (1640‚Äì1698), Kuriyama Senp≈ç (1671‚Äì1706), and Miyake Kanran (1673‚Äì1718). The fundamental approach of the project was Neo-Confucianist, based on the view that historical development followed moral laws. Tokugawa Mitsukuni believed that Japan, as a nation that had long been under the unified rule of the emperor, was a perfect exemplar of a \\"nation\\" as understood in Sinocentric thought. The Dai Nihon-shi thus became a history of Japan as ruled by the emperors and emphasised respect for the imperial court and Shinto deities. In order to record historical facts, the school's historians gathered local historical sources, often compiling their own historical works in the process. Early Mitogaku scholarship was focused on historiography and scholarly work. Around the end of the eighteenth century, Mitogaku came to address contemporary social and political issues, beginning the era of Later Mitogaku. The ninth Mito clan leader, Tokugawa Nariaki (1800‚Äì1860), greatly expanded Mitogaku by establishing the K≈çd≈çkan as the clan school. In addition to Confucianist and kokugaku thought, the school also absorbed knowledge from medicine, astronomy and other natural sciences. The Later Mitogaku era lasted until the Bakumatsu period. The school exerted a major influence on the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement and became one of the driving forces behind the Meiji Restoration. However, it failed to gain the protection of the new government and the K≈çd≈çkan was disbanded and its library largely taken over by the state. The Mito-shi Gakkai of Mito city, Ibaraki prefecture, is undertaking research into the historical and ideological aspects of Mitogaku. Major works of the school include Shint≈ç sh≈´sei, Dai Nihon Jingi Shi, and Jingi Shiry≈ç, and collections and studies of fudoki and studies of the Kogo Sh≈´i.

It includes engravings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, figurines, portraits and even literary works. In Paleolithic art, fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. Many civilisations in history believed in fertility deities. In Classical mythology, Gaia (to the Greeks) or Terra (to the Romans), the personification of Earth, is associated with female fertility.http://www.goddess-guide.com/greek-goddess-of-the-earth.html Greek Goddess of the Earth Women are often depicted with a ripe bosom, a child- bearing hip and a nude body in some cases.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/30/art.familyandrelationships Laura Cumming on fertility in art Animals that reproduce prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility. Traditional cultures Venus of Willendorf, considered to be an example of fertility in art. Fertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some Pre-Columbian cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round bellies, short heads and short, pointed legs. They also exaggerate the hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva of the subject. Two of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the Venus of Willendorf (c. 25,000 BCE), an oolitic limestone figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in Austria and the Fertility Goddess of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in Romania, a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary shrine for the goddess. The rotundity and obesity of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when food was scarce.Roberts, 747 Western art =Early forms= Titian, copy of the Venus Anadyomene Fertility is often shown in artworks related to Classical mythology. Paintings of the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite (Venus to the Romans) often portray her as sexual and fertile. Homer's Iliad states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of Uranus. Venus Anadyomene is a painting by Apelles that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist Titian and known as Venus Anadyomene by Titian. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.Roberts, 140 https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/8687/venus-rising-sea-venus- anadyomene-about-1520 Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene') (About 1520) Demeter, the Greek goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of apples in sculptures, which are meant to show fertility. Johannes Gehrts: Eostre, the Germanic goddess flies through the heavens surrounded by Roman-inspired putti, beams of light, rabbits and birds. Germanic people look up at the goddess from the realm below. Hares are often portrayed in art as a symbol of rebirth and fertility.C. G. Jung, Man and his Symbols (1964)p. 99 The Germanic goddess Eostre, whose themes are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. In Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in Freiburg Minster, where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth. In Jan Van Eyck's Arnolfini portrait, a carving of St. Margaret of Antioch (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.Roberts, 749 =Modern= Paula Modersohn-Becker's series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.Roberts, 64 Rembrandt's The Jewish Bride is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are Jewish. The Painting portrays the fertility of the young couple, particularly that of the woman. The shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, a nursery rhyme.G. Legman, The Rationale of the Dirty Joke (1973) Vol II p. 90 In Botticelli's Primavera, on one hand the Three Graces represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them Flora, the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.Edmund Swinglehurts, Botticelli (1994) p. 26-7 In Picasso' paintings of Marie-Th√©r√®se Walter, everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal.John Golding, in D. H Kahnweiler et al eds., Picasso 1881/1973 (1973) p. 184 In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced Hal Saflieni Reclining Woman and the Venuses of Lespugue and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.Golding, p. 115-6 =Literature= In The Bacchae, an ancient Greek tragedy written by Athenian playwright Euripides, Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the Life Force. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.Neil Curry trans., Euripides (Cambridge 1981) p. 164 and p. 116 When at the close of Possession: A Romance, a novel by A. S. Byatt, the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.A. S.

Danger Boy and his time- traveling companions are in for some shocking surprises when they meet up with an earlier expedition‚Äîthe historical journey of Lewis and Clark. City of Ruins After another close call, the good news is that Eli Sands, aka Danger Boy, is back in San Francisco in 2020.

Originally developed by ATI Technologies around the Radeon X1900 XTX in 2006, the product line was previously branded as both ATI FireSTREAM and AMD Stream Processor.AMD Press Release The AMD FireStream can also be used as a floating- point co-processor for offloading CPU calculations, which is part of the Torrenza initiative. The FireStream line has been discontinued since 2012, when GPGPU workloads were entirely folded into the AMD FirePro line. Overview The FireStream line is a series of add-on expansion cards released from 2006 to 2010, based on standard Radeon GPUs but designed to serve as a general-purpose co-processor, rather than rendering and outputting 3D graphics. Like the FireGL/FirePro line, they were given more memory and memory bandwidth, but the FireStream cards do not necessarily have video output ports. All support 32-bit single-precision floating point, and all but the first release support 64-bit double-precision. The line was partnered with new APIs to provide higher performance than existing OpenGL and Direct3D shader APIs could provide, beginning with Close to Metal, followed by OpenCL and the Stream Computing SDK, and eventually integrated into the APP SDK. For highly parallel floating point math workloads, the cards can speed up large computations by more than 10 times; Folding@Home, the earliest and one of the most visible users of the GPGPU, obtained 20-40 times the CPU performance. Each pixel and vertex shader, or unified shader in later models, can perform arbitrary floating-point calculations. History Following the release of the Radeon R520 and GeForce G70 GPU cores with programmable shaders, the large floating-point throughput drew attention from academic and commercial groups, experimenting with using then for non-graphics work. The interest led ATI (and Nvidia) to create GPGPU products ‚Äî able to calculate general purpose mathematical formulas in a massively parallel way ‚Äî to process heavy calculations traditionally done on CPUs and specialized floating-point math co-processors. GPGPUs were projected to have immediate performance gains of a factor of 10 or more, over compared to contemporary multi-socket CPU-only calculation. With the development of the high-performance X1900 XFX nearly finished, ATI based its first Stream Processor design on it, announcing it as the upcoming ATI FireSTREAM together with the new Close to Metal API at SIGGRAPH 2006. The core itself was mostly unchanged, except for doubling the onboard memory and bandwidth, similar to the FireGL V7350; new driver and software support made up most of the difference. Folding@home began using the X1900 for general computation, using a pre-release of version 6.5 of the ATI Catalyst driver, and reported 20-40x improvement in GPU over CPU. The first product was released in late 2006, rebranded as AMD Stream Processor after the merger with AMD. The brand became AMD FireStream with the second generation of stream processors in 2007, based on the RV650 chip with new unified shaders and double precision support. Asynchronous DMA also improved performance by allowing a larger memory pool without the CPU's help. One model was released, the 9170, for the initial price of $1999. Plans included the development of a stream processor on an MXM module by 2008, for laptop computing, but was never released. The third-generation quickly followed in 2008 with dramatic performance improvements from the RV770 core; the 9250 had nearly double the performance of the 9170, and became the first single-chip teraflop processor, despite dropping the price to under $1000. A faster sibling, the 9270, was released shortly after, for $1999. In 2010 the final generation of FireStreams came out, the 9350 and 9370 cards, based on the Cypress chip featured in the HD 5800. This generation again doubled the performance relative to the previous, to 2 teraflops in the 9350 and 2.6 teraflops in the 9370, and was the first built from the ground up for OpenCL. This generation was also the only one to feature fully passive cooling, and active cooling was unavailable. The Northern and Southern Islands generations were skipped, and in 2012, AMD announced that the new FirePro W (workstation) and S (server) series based on the new Graphics Core Next architecture would take the place of FireStream cards. Models * FireStream 9170 include Direct3D 10.1, OpenGL 3.3 and APP Stream * FireStream 92x0 include Direct3D 10.1, OpenGL 3.3 and OpenCL 1.0 * FireStream 93x0 include Direct3D 11, OpenGL 4.3 and OpenCL 1.2 with Last Driver updates Software The AMD FireStream was launched with a wide range of software platform support. One of the supporting firms was PeakStream (acquired by Google in June 2007), who was first to provide an open beta version of software to support CTM and AMD FireStream as well as x86 and Cell (Cell Broadband Engine) processors. The FireStream was claimed to be 20 times faster in typical applications than regular CPUs after running PeakStream's software . RapidMind also provided stream processing software that worked with ATI and NVIDIA, as well as Cell processors. =Software Development Kit= After abandoning their short-lived Close to Metal API, AMD focused on OpenCL. AMD first released its Stream Computing SDK (v1.0), in December 2007 under the AMD EULA, to be run on Windows XP.AMD APP SDK download page and Stream Computing SDK EULA , retrieved December 29, 2007 The SDK includes \\"Brook+\\", an AMD hardware optimized version of the Brook language developed by Stanford University, itself a variant of the ANSI C (C language), open-sourced and optimized for stream computing. The AMD Core Math Library (ACML) and AMD Performance Library (APL) with optimizations for the AMD FireStream and the COBRA video library (further renamed as \\"Accelerated Video Transcoding\\" or AVT) for video transcoding acceleration will also be included. Another important part of the SDK, the Compute Abstraction Layer (CAL), is a software development layer aimed for low-level access, through the CTM hardware interface, to the GPU architecture for performance tuning software written in various high-level programming languages. In August 2011, AMD released version 2.5 of the ATI APP Software Development Kit, which includes support for OpenCL 1.1, a parallel computing language developed by the Khronos Group. The concept of compute shaders, officially called DirectCompute, in Microsoft's next generation API called DirectX 11 is already included in graphics drivers with DirectX 11 support.  AMD APP SDK  Benchmarks According to an AMD- demonstrated systemHardOCP report , retrieved July 17, 2007 with two dual-core AMD Opteron processors and two Radeon R600 GPU cores running on Microsoft Windows XP Professional, 1 teraflop (TFLOP) can be achieved by a universal multiply-add (MADD) calculation. By comparison, an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 3.0 GHz processor at the time could achieve 48 GFLOPS.Intel microprocessor export compliance metrics In a demonstration of Kaspersky SafeStream anti-virus scanning that had been optimized for AMD stream processors, was able to scan 21 times faster with the R670 based acceleration than with search running entirely on an Opteron, in 2007. Limitations *Recursive functions are not supported in Brook+ because all function calls are inlined at compile time. Using CAL, functions (recursive or otherwise) are supported to 32 levels.AMD Intermediate Language Reference Guide, August 2008 *Only bilinear texture filtering is supported; mipmapped textures and anisotropic filtering are not supported. *Functions cannot have a variable number of arguments. The same problem occurs for recursive functions. *Conversion of floating-point numbers to integers on GPUs is done differently than on x86 CPUs; it is not fully IEEE-754 compliant. *Doing \\"global synchronization\\" on the GPU is not very efficient, which forces the GPU to divide the kernel and do synchronization on the CPU. Given the variable number of multiprocessors and other factors, there may not be a perfect solution to this problem. *The bus bandwidth and latency between the CPU and the GPU may become a bottleneck.

He taught drummer Buddy Rich how to read music and co-wrote Buddy Rich's Modern Interpretation of Snare Drum Rudiments, published in 1942. Early years A native of New York City, Adler grew up during the Depression. He bought his first snare drum when he was thirteen and learned to play it without formal instruction. Two years later, he got a job playing at a hotel in Belmar, New Jersey. He began lessons with a professional pit drummer from the Palace Theater and studied timpani in his high school orchestra. Meeting Rich One of Adler's former students introduced Adler to Buddy Rich. \\"The kid told me he played better than Krupa. Buddy was only in his teens at the time and his friend was my first pupil. Buddy played and I watched his hands. Well, he knocked me right out. He did everything I wanted to do, and he did it with such ease. When I met his folks, I asked them who his teacher was. 'He never studied', they told me. That made me feel very good. I realized that it was something physical, not only mental, that you had to have.\\" In the same 1985 interview, Adler clarified the extent of his relationship with Rich and their collaboration on the instructional book. \\"Sure, he studied with me, but he didn't come to me to learn how to hold the drumsticks. I set out to teach Buddy to read. He'd take six lessons, go on the road for six weeks and come back. He didn't practice. He couldn't, because wherever the guy went, he was followed around by admiring drummers. He didn't have time to practice. Tommy Dorsey wanted Buddy to write a book and he told him to get in touch with me. I did the book and Tommy wrote the foreword. Technically, I was Buddy's teacher, but I came along after he had already acquired his technique.\\" Alder and Rich wrote Buddy Rich's Modern Interpretation of Snare Drum Rudiments (1942), which became a standard text for drummers. After the book was published, Adler opened a drum store in New York City. His students included Louie Bellson, Roy Burns, Sandy Feldstein, Alvin Stoller, and Dave Tough. He developed the Adler Technique after studying the movements of the arm, hand, and wrist. His technique intended to omit wasted motion. It concentrated on sight reading, mind body coordination, dexterity of right and left hands, and the study of diverse musical genres. During the 1960s, he started the Henry Adler Music Publishing Company. His books include How to Play Latin American Rhythm Instruments, Hand Development Techniques, and 4-Way Coordination: A Method Book for the Development of Complete Independence on the Drum Set. He also published instruction books by other authors. He had a small role in the move Desperately Seeking Susan in 1985. Adler revised Modern Interpretation of Snare Drum Rudiments in the 1990s with Ted MacKenzie and it was published in 2005.

The settlement stands at 500 metres above sea level, some 25 kilometres from Ranfurly, to which it is connected by both road and the Otago Central Rail Trail long-distance walking track. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place where the summer star stands still\\" for ≈åturƒìhua. History Oturehua lies beneath a Rough Ridge, a range of hills. The township was also called Rough Ridge until 1907. The area has changed little from its description in 1905 when it was described as good arable land, from which large crops are successfully raised. In 1905, the township comprised a post and telegraph office, a store, a hotel near the railway station, a school, coal pits and a flour mill. Of these, only the Gilchrist's General Store and the Oturehua Tavern remain. Features Hayes Engineering, located immediately southwest of the township, was once the home to Ernest Hayes, a farmer and flour miller who began producing and selling farm tools from his Oturehua property. Hayes invented the internationally acclaimed wire strainer, as well as pulley blocks, cattle stops and windmills. The Idaburn Dam, located 3km southwest of Oturehua along the Ida Valley Omakau Road is used for curling bonspiels when conditions permit. It is also the site of the annual mid-winter Brass Monkey Motorcycle Rally. The Otago Central Rail Trail runs through Oturehua, adjacent the Ida Valley Omakau Road. The settlement has a number accommodation options. The remnants of the Golden Progress quartz mine are located 2km east of Oturehua on Rough Ridge. These workings are notable as they still retain an intact poppet head, the only surviving one in the Otago goldfields. The Golden Progress poppet head was constructed of Australian hardwood and erected later than most, in 1928, which explains its survival. The mine was worked by three lignite-fired boilers, two for the poppet head to drive the winding gear and one to drive the battery further down the gully.Hall-Jones, J.

It was built from 1859 to 1862 and is believed to be the oldest privately owned residence in Brisbane. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  James Young, a bricklayer by trade who reputedly worked as a foreman for John Petrie, acquired of land at Milton, adjoining what later became Bishopsbourne, by deed of grant dated 22 August 1859. The house is believed to have been built by 1862, the first of three homes which Young constructed on the property, to accommodate a family of sixteen children. By the early 1870s, Young was renting the house to John Guthrie, a solicitor credited with naming the property \\"Lucerne\\", after the lake and town in Switzerland. A clue as to why Guthrie saw similarities is in the nature of the terrain; a steep sided watercourse would have bisected the property. To provide it with fresh water it may have been dammed, hence a lake or pond would have formed. On the western or opposite side of the property was Red Jacket Swamp, now the sports ground and park for Milton State School. In the late 1870s the Misses Davis possibly ran a school from the premises. By 1877 the house comprised drawing, dining and sitting rooms on the ground floor, an attic space divided into four bedrooms, a bathroom and detached kitchen-house with servant's quarters, along with various outbuildings. Alexander Duncan Campbell purchased the residence on early in 1879, and by mid-1883 Lucerne was in the possession of Agnes wife of John Scott MLA (1883-98). Scott, a pastoralist and parliamentarian, resided there until his death in 1898. The property remained in the hands of his heirs until purchased by Miss Annie Hirst in 1905. Members of the Hirst family lived at Lucerne for many years, until the former's death in 1940. Since 1947 the property has had three owners, the Wards, the Morrows and the O'Sullivans, the latter having resided at Lucerne since 1969. In that year a new kitchen and eating area were created along the enclosed rear verandah, and the old detached kitchen converted to a bedroom. A series of detached additions at the rear of the house have been erected since. Today, \\"Lucerne\\" comprises four buildings, used to provide bed and breakfast accommodation, within half an acre of land dominated by a large Port Jackson fig tree. The gabled brick main building with its high-pitched roof and dormer window is a rare survivor in contemporary Brisbane.  Description  Modest in concept, Lucerne is a single-storey, rectangular brick house with attic rooms. The dwelling consists of a central hallway with study and dining room to the right; a long sitting room to the left; modern kitchen and bathroom facilities at the rear; and an internal cedar staircase leading from a large room, projecting at the rear centre, to attic bedrooms and bathroom. A former detached kitchen house with fireplace is located at the rear to the east. French doors, with casement fanlights above, lead from the two front rooms onto the verandahs. Internal joinery is of cedar, which has been painted, and the walls are plastered. The whole is surmounted by a gabled roof with a ridge running transverse to the axis of the house. Roof shingling has been replaced with galvanised iron. An attic dormer window overlooks a simple timber posted front verandah, from which the original cross-braced balustrading has been removed. Casement windows with bull-nosed hoods have been added to each gable, which retain their scalloped bargeboards. Sympathetic detached additions have been made to the rear of the cottage since 1969.  Heritage listing  Lucerne was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Lucerne was built early in the Separation era, when Queenslanders were conscious of the need to substantiate their existence in the local environment. Brick cottages, often the homes of the lower middle-class, were relatively common at this time. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The gabled brick building with its high-pitched roof and dormer window is a rare survivor in contemporary Brisbane. Lucerne remains as a fine example of 1860s brick house construction, especially since it was erected by the artisan-owner as a family residence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Lucerne is an attractive house of unpretentious yet balanced proportions. The simplicity of form reflects both its function as a first home and the skill of its builder. Details such as the scalloped bargeboards, interior cedar staircase and joinery, and casement fanlights, are obvious aesthetic features. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. In a history spanning approximately one hundred and thirty years, Lucerne, which began as a craftsman's dwelling, became home to a number of notable Queensland families. As early as 1877, the house was advertised as a 'gentleman's residence', and such it has remained.

Dutch artist Frans Hals painted Pot in militia sash in Hals' The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633. Pot is the man reading a book on the far right. Biography Pot was born in Amsterdam and spent his early years in Amsterdam and Haarlem. In 1632 he traveled to London, where he painted the Royal Family. He lived from 1633 to 1648 in Haarlem, after which he moved to Amsterdam, where he died in 1657.Hendrick Gerritsz Pot. wallacecollection.org He served as Dean of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1626, 1630 and 1635. He served as the Guild's headman or Hoofdman in 1634 and 1648. He died in Amsterdam. Works and style Pot was probably a pupil of Karel van Mander, as was Hals, and they influenced each other. Pot‚Äôs paintings were sometimes allegorical in subject and he also painted group schutterstuk portraits, such as The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630. He was also influenced by painter and engraver Willem Buytewech. Pot was commissioned in London to paint portraits of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria in 1632; the results now hang in the Royal Collection in London. Pot‚Äôs type of genre scenes became known as \\"Merry Company\\" genre paintings. This included his 1635 piece, Portrait of a Young Woman, and a companion piece, now lost, as well as his 1630 piece, A Merry Company at Table. Both these paintings contain several objects considered sensual symbolism. A Merry Company at Table was set in a brothel, a popular theme in Dutch genre painting. The latter piece also contains a common theme addressed in Pot‚Äôs works; beauty, age and death. This theme culminates in his well-known piece Allegory of Vanitas, usually referred to simply as Vanity, and which also contains motifs and symbols of sensual love. Other well-known Pot works are A Startling Introduction, The Coin Collector and Flora‚Äôs Wagon of Fools (shown), in which he poked fun at the fledgling tulip trade in Haarlem, where for a short while the floral was sold by weight. His more standard, though still stylish, portrait works include his Portrait of Sir Robert Phelips and his works of the King and Queen of England.

The Weber Barn was the last in the Stephenson County area that the Haas Brothers worked on. The Weber Round Barn does differ from the barns in neighboring Stephenson County in its vitrified tile wall. This type of tile wall demonstrates an important period in the evolution of round barn design.Sculle, Keith A. \\",\\" (PDF) National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 9 January 1984, National Register Information System, National Park Service, pp. 7-15.

The Weber Round Barn stands out from other round barns, such as those in Stephenson County, as well. Compared to those barns, the Dennis Otte Round Barn, the Gerald Harbach Round Barn, James Bruce Round Barn, Chris Jensen Round Barn and the Charles Fehr Round Barn, the Weber Round Barn has an air of sophistication. This is due to its masonry walls, specially braced hip roof and metal framed windows and doors. Significance The Robert Weber Round Barn is one of 31 round barns that were constructed in a four county area, the Stephenson County area, that includes Winnebago County, Stephenson County and Rock and Green Counties in Wisconsin. Twenty one of those barns are within Stephenson County, just west of the Weber Barn. The Weber Barn is also significant for its tile walls which demonstrate a later period round barn preference. The Weber Round Barn was nominated for the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as part of the inaugural nomination through the Round Barns in Illinois Thematic Resources Multiple Property Submission. This means it met the criteria laid out beforehand for Illinois round barns. The building was listed on the National Register on February 2, 1984.

Almost all local governments take one of three forms: city councils, which governs a large municipality, local councils, which governs a small municipality, and regional councils, which governs a group of communities, often but not necessarily of a rural nature. All Israeli local governments are operated under a strong Mayor‚Äìcouncil system. They appoint a head, or mayor, who is selected through a process of democratic elections along with his fellow council members. If a council's operation is impeded by a severe financial crisis, the Interior Minister may dissolve it, fire the council head, and appoint a special commission to operate the council until normalisation. Councils may enact bylaws for improvement of the residents' quality of life, and in addition to the levy of direct taxes, are allocated funds from the national government via the Interior Ministry. City and local councils are united in the framework of the \\"Centre for Local Government in Israel\\", founded in 1938, while regional councils are organised in a separate body.

The district planning commission is a joint state-local authority which approves detailed local plans and acts as a forum for handling appeals of decisions. The local council is also authorized to issue by-laws in every area in which it has jurisdiction and has the power to enforce these laws as well as the laws and regulations applicable to its functions. Furthermore local authorities are allowed to levy local taxes and collect various payments for services and concessions. They prepare their own budgets, although these then must be approved by the Ministry of the Interior.

Massad's founder, Shlomo Shulsinger, emphasized Hebrew language as a key value in a multi-denominational Zionist Jewish environment. Massad was founded as a day camp in 1941 by the HaNoar Ha'Ivri with thirty campers, and eventually grew to three sleep-away camps in Pennsylvania, Massad Alef, Bet, and Gimmel, collectively known as the Massad Hebrew Camps in the United States () At its peak in the late 1960s, the Massad camps hosted over a thousand campers and staff each summer. In its forty years of existence, the camp strongly influenced both Jewish camping and Hebrew culture in North America. History =Early years= Staff picture (1941) The HaNoar Ha‚ÄôIvri movement () was established in 1937 to build a Jewish life in the United States that promoted Zionism and the revival of the Hebrew language. In September 1940, the HaNoar Ha'Ivri conference reached a unanimous decision to establish an immersive Hebrew-speaking camp, an idea initiated by Shlomo Shulsinger, who came to the United States from Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s. The camp's name, from the Hebrew word meaning \\"foundation\\", was inspired by a line from the poem Birkat Am by Hayim Nahman Bialik. In its first season in 1941, Massad operated as a day camp at Far Rockaway, Queens with Shulsinger as camp director. While deemed a success, members of HaNoar Ha‚ÄôIvri felt that Massad had failed to realize its potential due to interruptions from the campers‚Äô everyday life, with the campers' English- and Yiddish-speaking families and the secular non-Jewish atmosphere of the city diluting the transformative effect of Massad's Hebrew culture. Lacking funds to purchase its own camp, in its second season Massad shared the facilities of Camp Machanaim, an Orthodox Jewish camp in Monticello in the Catskill Mountains, with an enrollment of forty-five campers and ten staff members. In the summer of 1943, Massad finally relocated to its own site in Tannersville, in the Pocono Mountains. =Growth and development= Massad's enrollment grew steadily during the 1940s as it attracted campers from various Jewish denominations. To meet the growing demand, Massad opened a second camp, Massad Bet, in Dingmans Ferry, Pennsylvania in 1948. Massad Gimmel opened in nearby Effort, Pennsylvania in 1966. In 1951, Massad launched its Machon Ma‚Äôale () program for the preparation of Hebrew-speaking counselors, with Professor Hillel Bavli serving as its first director. In 1960, Massad opened up a new division called Prozdor (a preparatory program for the Machon) for 15-year-old campers. In the 1950s and 1960s, Massad drew the majority of its campers from the Talmud Torahs and day schools in New York, admitting mainly campers with Hebrew educational backgrounds The bulk of the camp populations came from the centrist Orthodox community, especially from the students of the Ramaz School and Flatbush Yeshivot. The Massad camps had their largest camper enrolment in the 1966-68 summers, with 914 campers in 1966, 937 in 1967, and 925 in 1968. Among other prominent visitors to the camp, Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Goren visited Massad Alef in 1974. =Decline= By the 1970s there was a downward trend. In 1971, for the first time, campers who chose so were accepted for a one-month session. In 1974, facing rapidly declining registration, Massad Gimmel was sold. After the Shulsingers retired in 1977, their successors attempted to orient the camp toward stricter religious observance in effort to address the changing realities of Jewish life in the United States and attract more Orthodox campers. However, Massad's enrollment continued to decline. Massad Bet closed after the 1979 season, and Massad Alef followed suit in 1981. The Massad Alef property was bought by the nearby Camelback Mountain Resort, while the Massad Bet site was used as a camp by the Bobover Hasidic community until 1996. A number of explanations have been given for the decline of the Massad movement, such as the rise and expansion of denominational camps like the Conservative-sponsored Camp Ramah, the Shulsingers' retirement, the availability of summer programs in Israel, the growing weakness of the American centrist Orthodox community, the suburbanization of American Jewry, and a waning birth rate. Moreover, Massad lost much of its camper base as it became increasingly perceived as both not traditional enough for Orthodox Jews, and too traditional for the growing number of secular, Reform, and Conservative Jews. The related Canadian Massad movement created three camps in Canada, Massad Alef at Lac Quenouille, Quebec, Massad Bet in Torrance, Ontario, and Massad Gimmel in Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba. The Quebec and Manitoba camps are still in operation. Culture The Massad movement sought to create a rich and authentic Hebrew Jewish life in the United States, and promote national renewal in Israel. While there were no formal classes, there was a carefully crafted educational program at the center of every aspect of the camp. Campers learned about Jewish traditions, the Hebrew language, culture, Zionism, and current events through their everyday activities. Starting in 1966, Massad had a delegation of 25-30 Israeli counselors each year (selected by the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem), who participated in all areas of camping. The streets of the camp and its buildings were named after Theodor Herzl, Hannah Szenes, Henrietta Szold, Hayim Nahman Bialik and other Zionist heroes. Shulsinger demanded that Hebrew alone be spoken at all times in the camp and gave awards to campers who achieved this goal. Given the camp's goal of an immersive Hebrew-language environment, Massad became the locus for a large amount of new Hebrew vocabulary, to describe American sports for instance. Massad's focus on spoken and written Hebrew extended to publishing a literary periodical, Alim ( 'Leaves'), which included guest pieces by such distinguished writers as William Chomsky, and a Hebrew-English dictionary that included more than 3,000 entries. One of the biggest activities of the summer, the Maccabia color war, divided the camp into two teams with opposing themes, which competed in various activities including songs, skits, sports, and pageants. In addition to the traditional and religious aspects of the camp, which included daily morning prayers and Shabbat observance, Camp Massad also aimed to inspire the love of living as a halutz in Israel through agricultural projects. Legacy Massad's influence on other major Jewish camps was significant. The founder of Camp Ramah attended, and Camps Morasha, Moshava, and Yavneh modeled themselves after Massad. The three volumes of Kovetz Massad document Camp Massad's culture and history. The first volume, published in New York in 1978, focused on Massad summer camps in the United States. The second volume, published in Jerusalem in 1989, was dedicated to Hebrew camping in North America, including a historical survey of several Hebrew camps and sociological data on the integration of Massad alumni into Israeli society. The third volume, published in Jerusalem in 1991, is a pictorial history of Camp Massad's forty years.

The first entered service in 1985 but accidents and lack of funds meant the last was not completed until 2004. The ships currently form the 2nd Corvette Division of the Argentine Navy and their home port is the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base. Although considered by its designers to be frigates, the Espora-class vessels have been classed in Argentina as corvettes. The Argentine Navy struggles to meet maintenance and training requirements because of financial problems and import restrictions. The Espora class has not been immune ‚Äì Espora herself spent 73 days in South Africa in late 2012 in a dispute about payment for repairs to its generators. The operational status of Parker and Rosales is not clear, as of November 2012 they were waiting for spares, whilst Spiro lost her sonar in a grounding accident in August 2012. Construction The 1974 Naval Constructions National Plan was an initiative by the Argentine Navy to replace old World War II-vintage ships with more advanced warships. The original plan called for six MEKO 360H2 destroyers, four of them to be built in Argentina, but the plan was later modified to include four MEKO destroyers built in Germany and six corvettes built in Argentina, for anti-surface warfare and patrol operations. The ships were designed by the German shipyard Blohm + Voss as a development of the Portuguese Navy's s, designed by the Portuguese naval engineer Rog√©rio de Oliveira in the late 1960s. All the ships of the class were built in Argentina at the AFNE \\"R√≠o Santiago\\" shipyard, close to the city of La Plata in Buenos Aires Province. The contract was signed on 1 August 1979 and the pennant numbers P10-P15 were assigned until they were changed to P41-P46 in 1988. The first three (P-41-P-43) were commissioned between 1985 and 1987, but Parker was delayed until 1990 after flooding on 2 October 1986. Fitting out of Robinson and G√≥mez Roca was suspended in 1992, briefly restarted in July 1994 and resumed on 18 July 1997. These last two have improved automation, communication and electronics systems; along with Parker they have a telescoping hangar fitted. All members of the class have the Thales DAISY combat data system, but Robinson has an indigenous command system as well. Service history Spiro and Rosales participated in the multinational task force blockading Iraq as part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990/1. The Esporas enforced the Argentine exclusive economic zone and captured a number of illegal fishing vessels in the early 1990s. In August 2012 Spiro hit a sandbank as she left Mar del Plata and lost her sonar. This meant Espora had to make an unscheduled deployment to replace her in the Atlasur IX naval exercise off West Africa. Espora left home with unresolved problems in her generators, which became worse until she ended up in South Africa with three failed generators. The German manufacturers MTU refused to repair them without payment in advance since Argentina still owed them money for previous work, so Espora spent 73 days at Simonstown until the dispute was finally resolved and the repairs completed. As of 2020 life extension programs for at least two units of the class were planned with work to be carried out at the R√≠o Santiago Shipyard. This work might incorporate a conversion of the operational profile of two ships, possibly toward supporting offshore patrol missions.https://www.zona-militar.com/2020/08/27/la-armada-argentina- extendera-la-vida-util-de-las- meko-140/https://www.infodefensa.com/latam/2020/08/10/noticia-ministerio- defensa-argentino-delinea-reequipamiento-armada-argentina.html Specifications *Displacement: n/a tons (empty); 1,790 tons (full load) *Length: n/a ft (91.2 m) *Beam: n/a ft (11.1 m) *Draught: n/a ft (4.5 m) *Propulsion: 2 shafts / propellers 2 Semt-Pielstick 16 PC2-5 V 400 diesel engines, tot.

Slightly less than a year after its creation it merged with the West German Social Democratic Party of Germany. History =Foundation= Markus Meckel What became East Germany was traditionally the heartland for the SPD in united Germany. In 1946, the Soviet occupation authorities forced the eastern branch of the SPD to merge with the eastern branch of the Communist Party of Germany to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). Within a short time, however, the few independent-minded members from the SPD side of the merger had been pushed out, and the SED became a full-fledged Communist party‚Äìessentially the KPD under a new name. Early in 1989, the Protestant theologians Markus Meckel and Martin Gutzeit took the initiative to revive a Social Democratic Party in the GDR. The two made organisational preparations and in April 1989 produced the first draft of the foundation appeal. In August, the appeal was presented at the Golgathagemeinde parish in Berlin. The appeal was signed by Meckel, Gutzeit, director and human rights advocate Ibrahim B√∂hme and theologian Arndt Noack. Calling for the foundation of a political party outside of the system of the National Front was a direct challenge to the political system of the GDR and especially to the SED, whose basis was undermined by the mere existence of a Social Democratic Party. The SED based its claim to power on being the sole representative of the working class. On 7 October 1989, forty or fifty people, mostly from Berlin and the southern parts of the country, assembled at the vicarage of Schwante, a town near Berlin, and founded the Social Democratic Party in the GDR. The party chose the abbreviation SDP to avoid associations with the SPD that had merged into the SED, and also to brand itself as independent of the West German SPD. Stephan Hilsberg, a programmer, was elected as the first party spokesman, while Ibrahim B√∂hme became manager. =In opposition= Between October and December, local groups of the SDP were formed in different towns. From 7 December 1989, two representatives of the party participated in the Round Table talks between Prime Minister Hans Modrow, who had become the de facto leader of East Germany after the SED surrendered its monopoly of power a week earlier, and various opposition groups. The talks resulted in representatives of the opposition groups joining Modrow's cabinet as ministers without portfolio until free elections to the People's Chamber could be held. On 29 January, Walter Romberg became the first Social Democrat appointed to the cabinet. Ibrahim B√∂hme after being elected party chairman in February 1990. On 13 January 1990, the party's first Conference of Delegates assembled in Berlin and decided to change the short form of the party name to SPD, to conform with (and profit from association with) the West German SPD. At the same time, party organisation was created at the level of districts and regions. Elections were scheduled for 18 March. Three weeks before that date, the SPD held its first party congress from 22 to 25 February 1990 in Leipzig. The congress decided on a basic manifesto and a statute of the party and also elected an executive board, with B√∂hme serving as party chairman and Meckel as one of his deputies. The election yielded disappointing results for the Social Democrats. Instead of gaining an absolute majority, as they had expected, they won 21.9% of the vote, resulting in 88 seats and second place. The party fared best in the districts of Berlin (34.9%), Potsdam (34.4%) and Frankfurt (Oder) (31.9%), and by far worst in the district of Dresden (9.7%). When the new parliament constituted itself, Social Democrat Reinhard H√∂ppner was elected vice-president of the People's Chamber. =In government= After internal debates the party members agreed to coalition talks with the winner of the election, the centre-right Alliance for Germany, consisting of the CDU, the DSU and Democratic Awakening, as well as with the Alliance of Free Democrats, an alliance of liberal parties. On 12 April, Lothar de Maizi√®re of the CDU formed a grand coalition cabinet including six Social Democrats, among them Markus Meckel (foreign affairs), Regine Hildebrandt (social issues) and Walter Romberg (finance). The SPD initially supported de Maizi√®re's policy of speedy reunification with West Germany, but left the cabinet on 20 August. Wolfgang Thierse Ibrahim B√∂hme was slated to have been a senior minister in the government. However, during the coalition talks he had been unmasked as a longtime Stasi informer by the West German news magazine Der Spiegel. Though B√∂hme failed to acknowledge this, he agreed to suspend his party functions (he was later expelled from the party in 1992). On 8 April 1990, Meckel was chosen as the interim chairman, until an extraordinary meeting in Halle (Saale) on 9 June 1990 elected Wolfgang Thierse as the new party chairman. At the same time, Willy Brandt, former Chancellor of West Germany and honorary chairman of the West German SPD, was elected as honorary chairman of the East German SPD as well. =Reunification= With German reunification approaching on 3 October 1990, the East German SPD held a final party congress on 26 September 1990, and decided to merge with the West German SPD. The following day, Wolfgang Thierse joined the unified party's executive board and was also appointed deputy chairman. He resigned from the latter position in 2005 but remained a member of the party executive until 2009. Literature * Wolfgang Grof: \\"In der frischen Tradition des Herbstes 1989\\".

It involves an apocalypse taking place in the near future, and those who will band together to survive it and those who bring it down upon this world. The game received publicity online after it was erroneously connected with the J. J. Abrams film Cloverfield. The game consists of a series of Flash puzzles, all concerning a giant sphere that changes shape as each one is solved. Behind the sphere, a city skyline at night is visible. As one completes the puzzles, the image progressively changes to that of a destroyed city. Over the main screen, stars are visible, and more appear as the puzzles progress. The leftmost and rightmost star are available from the beginning. The left one, which is glowing blue, will activate one's mail program with the address filled in; sending an email to this address originally resulted in an automated reply giving several tips on how to solve the puzzles; but in mid- July this message was changed to a more cryptic message (see below). The right one, when hovered over, will display 26 symbols that correspond to the alphabet and will be required in two of the puzzles. Solving puzzles will also treat visitors to videos that are somewhat damaged and difficult to comprehend.  Design  The online marketing strategy was designed by Orlando-based Mind Storm Labs using characters and story borrowed from their role playing game Alpha Omega: The Beginning and The End. The website for Ethan Haas Was Right was developed by the Los Angeles-based interactive shop, RED Interactive Agency.Red Interactive Agency  Characters  There are several characters who are assumed, for the purposes of the game, to be real people. Established characters are as follows. = Ethan Haas = A man who once foretold the coming destruction of the world; he had visions and was thought of as a prophet who recorded what he saw. He is now presumed to have been dead for a long time. No current significance has been attached to his name. According to the official Alpha Omega game website, Haas was a 19th- century Parisian author, virtually unknown to the public. His book, The Wheel and Other Stories, was dismissed as fiction. He vanished after the book's publication. But as the centuries progressed, the public accepted Haas as a prophet. Coincidentally and completely unrelated, Ethan Haas is also the name of the character first seen in The Class, a CBS sitcom starring Lizzy Caplan, who was in Cloverfield. = Van Mantra = Mantra, the only character so far that players have been able to actually see, is a student of Haas's teachings; he apparently found the writings of Haas, and began to believe them as he saw predictions come true. In the videos, Mantra appears in a dark setting, so it is difficult to make out much of his appearance or surroundings. Adding to the mystery surrounding him, Mantra's name may be a pseudonym. Mantra is the one who established the website, creating it as a test for those seeking to learn of Haas' prophecies, and leaving video recordings for those who completed the puzzles. In organizing the website, however, Mantra appears to be organizing a resistance/survivors group, after most of the known world meets its end. He has also sent out emails to those who used an address found on the website asking for help; after a certain amount of time, personalized help-mails stopped, and only an automatic response was sent, with a generic list of clues. Personalized emails continued intermittently, for instance in response to an inquiry about a purported Ethan Haas profile on MySpace, which Mantra dismissed. = The Mezin = The Mezin is a group of some kind, the details of which are not yet known. They are staunchly opposed to the teachings of Haas, and to the activities of Van Mantra, to the point where they hacked the outgoing message on Van Mantra's voice mail, prompting Van Mantra to go even deeper underground than before. It has recently been alluded that the Mezin may have captured Van Mantra. = Triton Enterprises = Triton Enterprises is a company reported to be run by the Mezin and is connected to the EHWR website. This becomes evident in the properties of the PDF file found on the Triton Enterprises website. The facility is currently on lockdown after some kind of crisis. Emails From Triton Enterprises entitled \\"[Security Protocol T1987E] Temporary Security Measures\\": :Due to a recent breach in security at our facility in Washington State Triton Enterprises has been required to engage a DoD level 4 security lock down. : :This security protocol is a requirement for all Department of Defense contractors when a minor security violation has been detected. : :Unfortunately due to the requirements of the lock down we must postpone all scheduled tours of our facility. : :Please be patient as we clear up this minor problem. We apologize if this lock down impacts any orders you may have with us. : :Once we are back online we will continue towards our goal of building the future one vision at a time. : :If you need more information please contact me at anytime. : :Kellie Graham Personalized emails are also reported to have been received from Triton regarding request for interviews and employment. =Kellie Graham= Kellie Graham is an employee of Triton Enterprises and if someone emails the Triton Enterprises information email they will receive an automatic email from the company signed by her. However, she also has her own company email which when emailed sends out a plea for assistance as of August 1. From Kellie Graham's company email entitled \\"Help us!\\": :Don't believe what Triton is telling you. I didn't write that security protocol notice. : :Something has gone terribly wrong at the facility!! If you are receiving this message please send help! There are several of us trapped on the lower D-ring testing platform. I had no idea what they were doing here, if I don't make it to the surface may God forgive me for any part I have played in this. : :I should have listened to him but I thought what he was talking about was nonsense, now I'm afraid he may be right.... The \\"him\\" mentioned in the email may be Van Mantra. If she is working for a company owned by the Mezin it is likely she would believe that he was insane for talking about the prophecies of Ethan Haas. However, Kellie seems to have come to believe him based on this and the hidden message in the PDF file on the Triton website. Now, if you email her, this is her response: From Kellie Graham's company email entitled \\"The end is near\\": :This will be my last email to the outside world. We've been sealed in from the outside; I don't think help will get here in time. We were fools to think we could control nature; the things we created here are not natural. I can only hope the truth is revealed to the world before it's too late. Before something down here escapes to the world out there.......... : :I should have listened to him but I thought what he was talking about was nonsense, now I'm afraid he may be right....  Puzzles  The text of an automated email from Mantra, also found in a hidden help section of ethanhaaswasright.com,Help me! offering the following message: :Share this message as guidance for how to navigate the 5 locks to the key code... : :1) The first lock will test your memory. Follow the trail of light and sound, but be careful  one wrong move will send you back to the beginning. : :2) For the second lock, you may need to look to the stars. They will help you find HAAS who will lead your way. : :3) The third lock will require you to extinguish all lights but one. Only with one light remaining will you be able to proceed. Americans can think like those peg games at Cracker Barrel. : :4) The fourth lock will let you move all 4 pieces through the control of one. However, unless the three key pieces are simultaneously placed into position, you will not be granted access. (‚Üë‚Üê‚Üì‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí‚Üë‚Üí‚Üë‚Üê‚Üê) : :5) The fifth lock will be the toughest. Seek help again from the stars to reveal your key and the message that you must decode. The two working together will open the way. : :Good luck. : :Van  Videos  Each video plays after the corresponding puzzle is solved, and can be paused, or stopped to go back to the main part of the site. The videos can be accessed again by clicking on the stars that appear after solving each puzzle. The videos are also available on YouTube.  Van's emails  The following email was recently sent to visitors seeking help through emailing Van at the Haas site: :I think I'm safe, for now. Wherever I go it isn't long before they find me. : :It seems The Mezin are connected to every aspect of humanity, from culture and religion to our most advanced technology : :I have to be more careful contacting all of you. When I began I thought I could safely speak about his writings and perhaps save us all but now it seems I will have to find a more subtle way to share his visions. : :If this is the first message you have received from me do not give up hope! There are others that have gone before you, the way has been found, you only need to search and you will find the answers you seek. We will all have a role to play. We are getting stronger, our voices will be heard! : :I have more of Haas's writings, once I find a secure way to transmit them I will leave you clues to find them. : :The more I read the more I realize Haas was right......... Another Email is sent when your email the address given on the website with \\"54312\\" which is the numbers flashed in the fourth video. The email reads: :Time is running out! : :If this is the first message you have received from me do not give up hope! There are others that have gone before you, the way has been found, you only need to search and you will find the answers you seek. We will all have a role to play. We are getting stronger, our voices will be heard! : :I have more of Haas's writings, I found a secure way to transmit them but I cannot make it easy to find them. There are others who would destroy them if they could. : :know the stars of Cassiopeia and you will know when you've reached your destination. : :The more I read the more I realize Haas was right......... :279fh7691 The number sequence \\"279fh7691\\" leads to one of the three letters.  Divinus  Upon completing all five puzzles and watching all five videos, a sixth form of the sphere appears, as a tablet with greenery growing around it in contrast to the destroyed city behind it. Across the top of the tablet is the word 'Divinus'. It has an input for Name and Email, with a submit button that says 'Remind Me', citing the date of the 1st of August, referencing the fifth video which lists August 1 as an important date to meet back at the EHWR website. Presumably, entering one's email will prompt a reminder to revisit the site closer to the 1st, though the exact purpose of this is not yet known for sure. In addition to the Divinus tablet, upon completing the puzzles, several other changes occur to the setting.

Cloverfield connection  Although they were incorrect in the end, many speculated that EHWR was connected to the Paramount-produced movie, \\"Cloverfield\\". This claim was supported by the similar themes of the viral marketing campaign and the trailer; as well, Paramount removed videos of the Cloverfield trailer, as well as videos concerning EHWR, suggesting that they had legal rights to both, which led many players to believe the two were connected. This, however, could have been because many Van Mantra videos were labeled as \\"Cloverfield Video\\" or \\"Ethan Haas-Cloverfield\\", making it probable that YouTube merely removed the videos due to them simply containing the term \\"Cloverfield\\" somewhere on the video page. In an e-mail to aintitcool.com (purportedly from Cloverfield producer J.J. Abrams), a connection between Cloverfield and Ethan Haas was denied.JJ Abrams drops Harry a Line on all this 1-18-08 stuff! - Ain't It Cool News: The best in movie, TV, DVD, and comic book news However, there are still were a few outstanding similarities. Everyone who completed the puzzles on the Ethan Haas website and gave their email addresses received a message on January 18, 2008 (the release date of Cloverfield). The subject line read \\"The Revelations of Ethan Haas Has Begun 1-18-08\\", putting emphasis on the date, which was written in the same format that was used for the promotion of the film. Lizzy Caplan, the actress playing Marlena in the film, was also on the sitcom The Class, in which she had a romantic interest in a character named Ethan Haas.  Alpha Omega: The Beginning and The End  On July 7, 2007, OMG WTF EHWR?!OMG WTF EHWR?! traced domain record information to an individual with connections to an RPG company called Mind Storm Labs. It was the first published evidence that Ethan Haas Was Right might be a promotion for that company's forthcoming role-playing game, Alpha Omega: The Beginning and The End. Four days later, on July 11, 2007, Wraith, a former writer for the now- defunct Total Gamer News, unaware of any previous proof, presented further evidence (along with a photo comparison supporting his claim) that Ethan Haas indeed was a promo for the Mind Storm Labs game Alpha Omega: The Beginning and The End.RPG Titles, Alpha Omega and Other Fantasy Role Playing Games If all the puzzles at EthanHaasWasRight.com are finished, the reader can see that the city in the background is badly wrecked, and about an inch from the left of that, the reader can faintly see a similar image (including the tank) from the Alpha Omega site. Although not conclusive evidence of a connection, the solution for puzzle #5 \\"The beginning is the end\\" appears to be a slight variation on the biblical Alpha and Omega \\"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\\" (Revelation 22:13) Also, the alphabet key that appears when you hover your mouse cursor over one of the stars has a complete set of 26 in-game symbols, but only the real-world \\"A\\" and \\"Z\\" shown below them; the 24 letters in between are only implied, not shown. A and Z are the first and last letters of the English alphabet, as alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. As of August 2, this was confirmed as the website has changed linking to a screen asking the following: :The time has come... : :Ethan Haas' message has been heard by millions. The war is coming but now we are united and ready. Forces are aligning against us, ancient powers who have laid in wait for centuries waiting for the chance to plunge this world into ruin. But now is our chance - I've found a safe place where we can rally together and prepare for the coming storm. Now is the time to choose what role you will play. : :Are you ready? :No I need to see and hear the warnings first :Yes Show me what lies ahead for us all Clicking \\"No\\" takes you back to the original site with the puzzles. Clicking \\"Yes\\" takes you to the new official Alpha Omega website.  News coverage  EHWR has seen much coverage online as well as coverage in USA Today, Forbes Magazine and the LA Times. While most have been unable to provide definitively new information, they have largely served to spread notice of the viral marketing campaign to the Internet community at large, and were the ones to first point out the viral marketing campaign to prospective players. All of the online coverage has been related to a supposed link between EHWR and J. J. Abrams' \\"Cloverfield\\". *CinematicalMore Viral Marketing for J.J.

The world was again remade, and the glow was as the coming of the sun upon the Earth.

Biography Facciolo owned part of the Portofino Soccer Club, a social club on Flatlands Avenue in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Salvatore Visconti and Steven who ran it were successful dealers of stolen goods. The club was named after Portofino, a small Italian fishing village, comune and tourist resort in the province of Genoa on the Italian Riviera where Salvatore and Albert's immigrant parents originated from. Previously he had managed and owned a restaurant named The Spice of Life located at 32 Cedar Street in Hanover, New Jersey which is still in operation as of 2007. Carlos Facciolo, Salvatore and Giuseppe had opened the club after getting permission from Louie Facciolo in South America. The Gambino crime family agreed to accept $250-a-week in protection money to allow them to operate the social club on Bruno's turf. Louie enjoyed acting the role of a made man even though he wasn't and fraternized with Salvatore and Steve. Louis Facciolo and Salvatore Visconti had been close friends for decades. For three decades, they and their brothers, the late Alfred Visconti and Bruno Facciolo, had been associated with the Lucchese crime family. In the early 1990s Anthony \\"Gaspipe\\" Casso and Louis Daidone of the Lucchese crime family thought that Bruno Facciolo and Alfred Visconti were government informants. Louis's brother Bruno was found shot to death in August 1990. He was murdered by the NYPD \\"mafia cops\\". His corpse was left in the trunk of his car with a canary stuffed in his mouth because Casso suspected him of being a government informer. Louis Facciolo is the father of VH1 Mob Wives of Carla Facciolo. Generosity to friends His close lifelong friend Alfred Visconti was gunned down at his Bensonhurst, Brooklyn apartment building in March 1991. At the time Alfred's brother, Lucchese crime family mobster Salvatore Visconti was not financially secure. So Louie gave more than $10,000 to Salvatore for Alfred's funeral and his wake which was held at Guarino's Funeral Home. Salvatore becomes an informant Salvatore Visconti enticed his friend Louis and 46 other alleged thieves and gangsters including Angelo McConnach into a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sting operation in which $6 million in stolen goods was recovered. In 1993 Bruno's friend Salvatore who had been an informer for some time, agreed to become a cooperating witness and set up an FBI agent who would play a big time fence to the Gambino crime family's Canarsie, Brooklyn-based crew. He approached Louie Facciolo and said he was now flush and wanted to pay him back for Alfred's funeral. Louie also brought his Gambino capo Leonard DiMaria into the sting.http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-02-02/news/18035619_1_fbi-agent- new-york-fbi- brothershttp://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-01-24/news/18029597_1_gambino- fbi-sting-new-york-fbi References Category:1941 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Gambino crime family Category:American mobsters of Italian descent ","title":"Louis Facciolo"},{"id":"12273738","text":"upright Paul Bush (born 1956, north London) is a British experimental film director and animator. The son of classical composer Geoffrey Bush, Paul Bush studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College under Michael Craig-Martin. He later taught himself how to make films while a member of the London Film-Makers' Co- op. He has since made numerous short and medium length films including The Cows Drama (1984), His Comedy (1994), Rumour of True Things (1996), Furniture Poetry (1999), While Darwin Sleeps (2004), and many others. He has won prizes at animation festivals in the Netherlands, Barcelona, Zagreb, Hiroshima, Bombay, Chicago and other places throughout the world. His website contains extracts of many of his films. His films \\"Furniture Poetry\\"(1999) and 'While Darwin Sleeps' (2004) closely resemble Jan ≈†vankmajer's animation 'Historia Naturae, Suita' (1967) In addition to directing and animating, Bush pioneered a technique seen in a number of his films, including The Albatross. The technique involves scratching frame by frame directly into the surface of colour filmstock over live action footage, creating an animated sequence which resembles traditional wood engraving. Since 2002 Bush has increasingly focused on time lapse portraits of people and more conventional animation including a collaboration with artist Lisa Milroy which produced Geisha Grooming (2003). Between 1981 and 1993, Bush also taught film-making, established a film workshop in South London, and supervised a wide variety of courses and the production of numerous student films. between 1995 and 2001 he taught on the visual arts course at Goldsmiths.

Spanish for The Eastern Tigress, the \\"east\\" being the Peruvian Amazon) is a singer, hairdresser, actress, makeup artist and model. Due to the popularity of her videos on YouTube (the video for her single \\"Nuevo Amanecer\\" surpassed the 10-million-hit mark in 2009), she has become an internet meme and reached some international fame. La Tigresa is known for her leopard garb, makeup and appearance, and for the choreographies staged by her dancing troupe, which includes three women and one man. Her first single \\"Nuevo amanecer (New Dawn)\\" became an Internet meme in Latin America. Her videos for her first recording are unique, if low in budget, and were filmed in the Peruvian jungle with her \\"exotic\\" dancers. Other singles from Bustos include: \\"Mi canoa\\", \\"Carnaval en Iquitos\\", \\"Trabaja flojo trabaja\\", \\"Anaconda\\", \\"Tr√°nsfuga de mi amor\\", \\"Hombre de Madera\\", and \\"Homenaje al Papa Juan Pablo II.\\" In 2011, she released her second record label plate Fiesta Felina, and later that same year took the English version of \\"Nuevo amanecer\\", entitled \\"New brighter day\\". Biography Bustos was born in the village of Constancia in the region of Loreto. She was interested in singing and she tried to pursue it as a career. However, it was unsuccessful due to pressure from her parents, and later from her husband, whom she married in a failed hope for greater freedom. Bustos became a cosmetologist at an early age, and emigrated to Lima, expecting to be involved in show business in some way, becoming a makeup artist for Lima's television stations and starting a career that lasted for over twenty years. In 1999, with help from several friends (Elizabeth Alegr√≠a and Aracely), she started writing songs and created the concept for \\"La Tigresa\\" and was later convinced of recording several music videos. Around 2006, her videos appeared on YouTube and rapidly became popular and an internet meme, and she has since then been invited to several Latin American television shows. International Fame According to an interview in the Peruvian newspaper La Rep√∫blica, Bustos signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records M√©xico for one year. With the first payment of the contract's royalties she bought her first automobile. Some of her fans have released video tributes to her -trying to emulate her act,- and even Tigresa remixes (in techno and reggaeton versions) of her music exist.

During the communist regime of Josip Broz Tito, Puƒçnik was one of the most outspoken Slovenian critics of dictatorship and lack of civil liberties in Yugoslavia. He was imprisoned for a total of seven years, and later forced into exile. After returning to Slovenia in the late 1980s, he became the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, a platform of democratic parties that defeated the communists in the first free elections in 1990 and introduced a democratic system and market economy to Slovenia. He is also considered one of the fathers of Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia.Rosvita Pesek: Puƒçnik je bil motor slovenskega osamosvajanja , Pogvori drugisvet.com  Early life and formation  Puƒçnik was born in the village of ƒåre≈°njevec in Slovenian Styria (now part of the municipality of Slovenska Bistrica), in what was then the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He came from a Roman Catholic peasant background. His family had supported the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People during World War II: his older brother Ivan was an anti-Nazi resistance fighter in the Yugoslav Partisan movement. Already as a teenager, Puƒçnik clashed with the communist establishment. Because of some critical thoughts published in the high school paper Iskanja (Quests) he was prohibited from taking his final exam.Jo≈æe Puƒçnik (1932-2003), Mladina.si ] Since he couldn't enroll in the University, he was drafted in the Yugoslav People's Army. After completing the military service, he took the final exam, passed it and enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied philosophy and comparative literature, graduating in 1958. While living in Ljubljana, he became involved with a group of young intellectuals, known as the Critical generation, which tried to open a space for public debate and challenged the rigid cultural policies of the Titoist regime in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Among Puƒçnik's closest collaborators from that period were the literary historian Taras Kermauner, sociologist Veljko Rus, and poet Veno Taufer. Puƒçnik believed that the system could be changed from inside and therefore joined the Communist Party of Slovenia. At the same time, he published several articles in the journal Revija 57, in which he openly criticised the economic policies of the communist regime.  The dissident years  In 1958, Puƒçnik was arrested accused of \\"subversion of the socialist system\\" and sentenced to 9 years in jail. At the trial, which lasted only a couple of hours, he was accused of having instigated workers to strike. Some have suggested that Puƒçnik's imprisonment was a deliberate attempt by the regime to silence dissident intellectuals.Interview with Taras Kermauner on the Sloevnian National TV He was released in 1963 and immediately continued writing for the alternative journal Perspektive. At this point he was already publicly stating his disapproval of the regime. In 1964, his article Problemi na≈°ega kmetijstva (The Problems of Our Agriculture) was published in the journal Perspektive. In it, Puƒçnik criticized the agricultural policy of the regime, arguing that it was inefficient using publicly available official data. He was arrested again, sentenced to another two years in prison and expelled from the Communist Party. During his time in prison, Puƒçnik became an idol for his generation.Odprti kop - Intervju: Dr. Taras Kermauner The playwright Dominik Smole dedicated the play Antigone to him and Primo≈æ Kozak portrayed him in the leading role of his play Afera (The Scandal). Both plays were metaphors for the totalitarian repression in communist Yugoslavia.  Exile and academic career  Puƒçnik was released from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to Germany. He settled in Hamburg, making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a postgraduate student at the University of Hamburg, the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him with a copy of his degree.In≈°titut Jo≈æeta Puƒçnika => joze pucnik He thus enrolled again to undergraduate study of philosophy and sociology, obtaining his PhD in 1971. He worked at the universities of Hamburg and L√ºneburg, where he taught sociology. During his life in Germany, Puƒçnik became a supporter of the German Social Democratic Party, maintaining close relations with several of its leaders. In the late 1980s, he became an open admirer of the Social Democratic leader of Lower Saxony Gerhard Schr√∂der, later chancellor of Germany, whom he took as his main role model for his subsequent political activity.Taras Kermauner, Skupinski portret z Du≈°anom Pirjevcem. Ljubljana: Znanstveno in raziskovalno sredi≈°ƒçe, 2002. P. 139 In the academic sphere, he became influenced by the theories of J√ºrgen Habermas, Niklas Luhmann and his system theory, as well as by several phenomenological sociologists such as Alfred Schutz and the Slovene-born Thomas Luckmann.http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&id;=F681B62B-37ED-4910-8E7B-93F5B140CCE7 During his years of exile, he kept up a correspondence with several important critical intellectuals in Slovenia, especially Ivo Urbanƒçiƒç.  Return to Slovenia  In the 1980s, Puƒçnik could again publish articles in Slovenia, this time in the alternative journal Nova revija. In 1987, he co-authored the Contributions to the Slovenian National Program, published in the 57th issue of the Nova revija journal. The text was written as the response to the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts of 1986, and set the grounds for a political opposition to the communist regime. It was also the first legally published publication openly advocating Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. Puƒçnik's article was centred on issues of democratization and political plurality, and openly stressed the need for Slovenia's full sovereignty in order to secure such development. He returned to Slovenia in 1989 at the invitation of the newly formed opposition Social Democratic Union of Slovenia. He was elected president of the party in 1989 and the following year he was chosen as the leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, a common platform of all democratic opposition parties in Slovenia. The coalition won the first democratic elections in 1990. Puƒçnik ran for President of Slovenia but lost to Milan Kuƒçan, the last secretary general of the Communist Party of Slovenia. He was nevertheless elected to the Slovenian Parliament and remained the official leader of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, and the coalition's parliamentary leader. Between 1990 and 1992, he was among those who led Slovenia to independence from Yugoslavia. In 1992, after the fall of Lojze Peterle's coalition government, Puƒçnik decided to lead his party into a coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party and briefly served as vice-president in the first government of Janez Drnov≈°ek. In the elections of 1992, the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia suffered a complete defeat, gaining a mere 3.4% of the vote, barely securing the entry into the Parliament. Puƒçnik resigned as president of the party in favour of Janez Jan≈°a. Between 1992 and 1996, Puƒçnik served as a member of the National Assembly of Slovenia. During this time, he led a parliamentary commission to clarify political responsibility for the summary executions perpetrated by the communist regime in Slovenia after World War II . After 1996, he retired from active politics, but remained honorary president of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia and continued to voice his opinion on matters of public interest. He remained utterly critical of the policies of Prime Minister Janez Drnov≈°ek and President Milan Kuƒçan. He also criticized the political transition to democracy in general, especially the insufficient implementation of the rule of law, the widespread corruption and the maintenance of the power networks from the previous regime. He died in Germany in 2003 and was buried in his home village of ƒåre≈°njevec. His funeral was attended by a huge crowd. The eulogy was delivered by philosopher and his lifelong friend Ivo Urbanƒçiƒç.  Legacy  Puƒçnik is considered to be one of the fathers of independent Slovenia.V ƒçast domovini: Stati inu obstati, 6 January 2008Posmrtno odlikovanje za Jo≈æeta Puƒçnika Puƒçnikovega odlikovanja ni prevzel nihƒçe Objavljeno, 22 June 2006 Some, especially in the Slovenian right wing circles, have also called him \\"Father of Slovenian Democracy\\". In 2006, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinct Merits of Slovenia. In 2007, the Government of Slovenia named the main international airport in Slovenia, the Ljubljana Jo≈æe Puƒçnik Airport, after him. The decision was criticized by some, including the then President of Slovenia Janez Drnov≈°ek who publicly expressed his respect for Puƒçnik, but disagreed with the renaming of the airport after him. Author and journalist Spomenka Hribar, Puƒçnik's former colleague, stated that Puƒçnik would not have agreed with such renaming, because he was a modest person who disliked public praise and rejected any \\"cult of personality\\". A similar statement was made by Puƒçnik's son Gorazd, who however did not oppose the renaming and was present at the renaming ceremony. The Slovenian liberal conservative think tank Jo≈æe Puƒçnik Institute and the elementary school in his native ƒåre≈°njevec are also named after him. At the initiative of Milan Zver, the European Parliament announced on 11 June 2018 that a conference room will bear the name of Jo≈æe Puƒçnik.Dr. Zver: Ponosen, da ena vidnej≈°ih dvoran v EP zdaj nosi ime po dr.

Jo≈æe Puƒçnik was married twice. After his first release from jail in 1963, he met Irena ≈Ωerjal, a young Slovene author from Trieste, Italy, who studied Slavic philology in Ljubljana.Slovene Biographical Lexicon They married the same year, when Puƒçnik was already imprisoned again; Puƒçnik was not allowed to attend his own wedding, and his brother Ivan had to represent him at the ceremony instead. His first son was born in 1964. When Puƒçnik was released from prison in 1966, the family moved to Germany; in 1969, however, the wife decided to return to Trieste with the son, while Puƒçnik decided to stay in Germany.http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2014/01/joze_pucnik.aspx He later married Christel Kunath. They had a daughter named Katharina. He also adopted his second wife's son, called Marcus. His son from his first marriage, Gorazd Puƒçnik, is the director of the Sreƒçko Kosovel Boarding School in Trieste, Italy. His stepson Marcus Pucnik is a journalist, based in Barcelona, Spain.

It was located in the present-day city of Ageo, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. History The name \\"Ageo\\" appears as the name of a locality in Musashi Province in late Sengoku period documents, as a rest area was built by the Later H≈çj≈ç clan when they came into control of the area. Ageo-shuku became formalized as a post station on the Nakasend≈ç under the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. Per an 1843 guidebook issued by the , the town stretched for about 1.1 kilometers along the highway, with a population of 793 (372 men, 421 women), and boasted one honjin, three waki-honjin, one tonya and 41 hatago. Ageo-shuku was approximately 10 ri from the starting point of the Nakasend≈ç at Nihonbashi, which was the approximate distance the average traveler could walk in one day. Ageo-shuku was also famous for its large number of meshimori onna and numerous chaya. Though it was comparatively small in terms of its size as a post town on the Nakasend≈ç, Ageo-shuku had the largest honjin after Shiojiri-shuku. The honjin and waki- honjin were centered on Hikawakuwa Shrine, which still exists. The main honjin was located in front of the shrine, with one of the secondary ones on each side. The third secondary honjin was located just south of the shrine. A Maruhiro Department Store is now located on the former site of the honjin.Ageo-shuku Sanpo 1 . Hassy-Report. Accessed July 15, 2007.

Those expressions are said to be available at such a point. To be available on a program point, the operands of the expression should not be modified on any path from the occurrence of that expression to the program point. The analysis is an example of a forward data flow analysis problem. A set of available expressions is maintained. Each statement is analysed to see whether it changes the operands of one or more available expressions. This yields sets of available expressions at the end of each basic block, known as the outset in data flow analysis terms. An expression is available at the start of a basic block if it is available at the end of each of the basic block's predecessors. This gives a set of equations in terms of available sets, which can be solved by an iterative algorithm. Available expression analysis is used to do global common subexpression elimination (CSE). If an expression is available at a point, there is no need to re-evaluate it.

Early life  Born to Zainichi Korean parents holding South Korean nationality, Kyung-jae grew up in Nariai in Takatsuki, a small village of around 35 Korean families.MINTOHREN: Young Koreans Against Ethnic Discrimination in Japan, Yasunori FUKUOKA and Yukiko TSUJIYAMA, (Translation: John G. Russell) The Bulletin of Chiba College of Health Science, Vol.10, No.2. His father was a day labourer, while his mother worked in a quarry. Both were illiterate in Japanese and Korean. Further more, his mother, who had immigrated to Japan at the age of three, had forgotten how to speak Korean, and as a result, their home language was exclusively Japanese. Lee was given the name legal alias Ri Keisai and grew up being ashamed of his Korean background and due to his poverty. He revealed his Korean name to his classmates at his middle school graduation but had a strong desire to assimilate to the point of \\"hatred\\" towards Koreans and blaming his family's poverty on his parents' laziness. A state of mind which was only overcome by the intervention of a teacher, who raised the issue of anti-Korean discrimination, and the support and acceptance of Japanese friends. However, upon later entering a private high school he resumed the use of the Japanese name, Takayasu Keisai, and again hid his ethnicity.  Political career  After Lee graduated from high school in 1972, his former teachers provided him with no assistance in finding a job. While supporting himself through part- time work, he founded Mukuge no Kai, one of the predecessor organisations of Mintohren. The name came from mukuge, the Japanese word for hibiscus syriacus, a former symbol of resistance to Japanese colonial rule in Korea and the national flower of South Korea. He hoped to address the problems of violence and delinquency among Korean youth in Osaka; he chose to found a new association rather than work through existing ethnic associations such as Mindan or Chongryon because he felt both were more concerned with the politics of the Korean peninsula than of local Korean communities in Japan. Though at first they made little progress, their children's programme, founded in 1978, in Nariai was particularly successful; in 1985, they began a campaign which resulted in the establishment of a division in the city board of education devoted exclusively to education for ethnic Koreans, and the elimination of the requirement that city employees hold Japanese nationality. In 2006, Lee naturalised as a Japanese citizen in order to run for a position in the assembly of Osaka Prefecture. Running from his hometown, the Takatsuki electoral district, he estimated that he would require 13,000 votes to gain a seat. Though in the past, he had held on to his South Korean nationality as an expression of his identity, and joined campaigns demanding suffrage for foreign residents, he naturalised for the express purpose of representing foreign residents and other minorities in local politics. If elected, he would have been Osaka's first ethnic Korean assembly member; he hoped that his campaign would provide an opportunity for Koreans who had taken up Japanese nationality to strengthen their ethnic identity and express it openly to the society at large. However, in the end, out of six candidates competing for five seats, he came in last, with only 2,543 votes out of 127,646 cast (compared to 19,475 for the fifth-place candidate).

Licensed to Marion, Indiana, United States, the station serves the Muncie-Marion area. The station is currently owned by Hoosier AM/FM LLC and features programming from ESPN Radio. History WMRI went on the air in 1955; it was initially owned by Chronicle Publishing Company but was soon sold. WMRI later spawned an FM station at 106.9 MHz (the present day WXXC). From 1970 to 2006, the station was known as WGOM (for \\"Giant of Music\\", inspired by locally born James Dean's final movie Giant), with a Top 40 format before automating in the late 1970s. Rich Coolman, Stan Weil and Dave Gross \\"The Mad Doctor\\" (now at WLDE in Ft. Wayne) were some of WGOM's on-air personalities. At the time of the 1970 call letter switch, the station's Program Director was Ken Roberts, and on-air talent included Ed Shannon (Steve Brimmer), Craig Weston (Robert Skaff), Chuck Anthony (Doug Fredlund) and Mel Ballinger as News Director. The station's call letter change was accompanied by a new ID/jingle package from the renowned PAMS agency in Dallas, Texas, emulating the sound of WLS Chicago and other \\"top-40\\" era stations. Station Manager was Louis Disinger. Having transformed the AM station, Roberts departed for Ontario, California in late 1971, with Jonathan Morgan (Jim Arnold) arriving from Tucson, Arizona (KHUT) as the new Program Director. In this period, WMRI-FM continued its automated music service with pre-programmed tapes. The following year, Arnold, Brimmer, and Ballinger all departed for Tucson albeit to different stations; Arnold and Ballinger went to KCUB, and Brimmer went to KIKX. WGOM's Top 40 format competed with Muncie's WERK (then at 990 AM) and the former WHUT (now WGNR/1470 AM in Anderson) throughout the 1970s.

Red List Index (2019) The Red List Index (RLI), based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, is an indicator of the changing state of global biodiversity. It defines the conservation status of major species groups, and measures trends in extinction risk over time. By conducting conservation assessments at regular intervals, changes in the threat status of species in a taxonomic group can be used to monitor trends in extinction risk. RLIs have been calculated for birds and amphibians, using changes in threat status for species in each of the groups. As well as taxonomic groups, RLIs can show trends in extinction risk according to biogeographic realm, habitat type, and dominant threat process. Sampled approach Producing indices of change in extinction risk by comprehensively assessing whole species groups, while feasible for well studied groups with relatively few species, is not suitable for all taxonomic groups. Assessing every species in the larger and lesser known groups which comprise the majority of the world‚Äôs biodiversity, such as fungi, invertebrates (particularly insects) and plants, is not practical. The Red List Index (sampled approach) (SRLI) has been developed in order to determine the threat status and also trends of lesser-known and less charismatic species groups. It is a collaboration between IUCN members and is coordinated through the Institute of Zoology (IoZ), the research division of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The SRLI is based on a representative sample of species selected from taxonomic groups within animals (invertebrates and vertebrates), fungi and plants. Assessment of the selected species will provide baseline information on the current status of biodiversity. Reassessment at regular intervals will identify changes in threat status over time to provide a more broadly representative picture of biodiversity change. Applications The aim is that the SRLI will aid in the production of a global biodiversity indicator capable of measuring whether the rate of biodiversity loss has been reduced. In addition, it will help to develop a better understanding of which taxonomic groups, realms or ecosystems are deteriorating the most rapidly, why species are threatened, where they are threatened, what conservation actions exist and which actions are needed. The aim is to provide policy makers, resource managers, scientists, educators, conservation practitioners and the general public with more thorough knowledge of biodiversity change and further tools with which to make informed decisions. In April 2002 at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 188 Nations committed themselves to actions to: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels‚Ä¶‚Äù The RLI has been adopted by the CBD as one of the indicators to measure progress towards this important target, and specifically to monitor changes in threat status of species.

It produced and sold potato chips, corn chips and snacks, and relied on a small distribution network which was mostly bicycle-based. The name is a portmanteau of Sabrosas y Fritas, which means Tasty and Fried (or Fried ones) in Spanish. In 1966, a year after Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola Company merged to form Pepsico, Sabritas was bought out. It started modernizing its processes and expanding its retail channel. In 2000, Sabritas made taco shells that inadvertently contained Starlink, a genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption. The contaminated flour was supplied by a mill in Texas. The shells were made on behalf of Kraft, which distributed them in Taco Bell- branded packages to supermarkets; Kraft recalled the taco shells when the Starlink was detected by Friends of the Earth.Taco Bell Recalls Shells That Used Bioengineered Corn - Los Angeles Times  Present day  Sabritas is the brand under which Pepsico brands the Frito-Lay products in Mexico, such as Cheetos, Fritos, Doritos and Ruffles. It is also the namesake for its own line of potato chips. Frito-Lay also sells variations of its products under the Sabritas brand in U.S. states bordering Mexico. Some seasons, every bag of Sabritas contains non-wrapped plastic and Tazos. Tazos are known as POGS in the U.S. It also has several local products such as Crujitos, Poffets, Rancheritos and Sabritones. Sabritas controls around 80% of the Mexican snacks market, while the company's main competitor, Grupo Bimbo's Barcel has 12% of it.

The station is currently owned by Hoosier AM/FM. History The station signed on in 1948 as WMRI and featured a beautiful music format. In the 1990s, WMRI was owned by Bomar Broadcasting, which made WMRI the flagship station of their mini-network of easy listening stations throughout Indiana. Stations in this network included WLEZ (now WBOW) Terre Haute, WEZV (now WBPE) in Lafayette, and WYEZ (now WHPZ) in South Bend. WYEZ was the first network station sold and went to LeSEA Broadcasting. WEZV was sold in 1998 to Artistic Media Partners, and WLEZ was sold to Crossroads Communications in the early 2000s. Bomar sold WMRI shortly thereafter to Mid- America Radio, owners of crosstown country outlet WCJC and oldies WBAT, (now Hoosier AM/FM LLC). Programming WMRI's programming mainly consisted of beautiful music (easy listening) for much of its existence. However the format was aging and so were its faithful listeners. WMRI held on to the B/EZ format for much longer than a majority of stations nationwide as many dropped or gradually moved away from the format by the mid to late 1980s. In the fall of 1998, WMRI ended its beautiful music run and flipped to adult contemporary as \\"Lite Rock 106.9\\". Their lone existing network station in Terre Haute also flipped to AC as \\"Lite Rock 102.7\\". The format consisted of Marion-based deejays by day and satellite programming from Westwood One's (now Dial Global) Bright AC format at night. Since Bright AC was a Hot AC format and WMRI itself featured a much softer blend of music by day, the station switched affiliations to Jones Radio Networks 'AC' format (now part of Dial Global) to create format uniformity all day. In the early 2000s, WLEZ was sold to a Terre Haute-based company and ended Bomar's radio network stint. The programming structure on WMRI, however, continued. The only exception was for on-air personalities who now had the freedom to talk about station promotions and other Marion-based mentions. The mix of local and satellite content through Jones continued until 2006 when the format was dropped in favor of classic hits. The WMRI calls were moved to their AM sister station (formerly WGOM), which took on an adult standards format, as 106.9 became WXXC. On November 18, 2013 the station dropped the branding \\"106.9 WXXC\\" and the Classic Hits format and became \\"Star 106.9\\" and now features an Adult Contemporary format, playing hits from the 1990s to now \\"The 90s to Now.\\" The station features a line-up of Bob and Sheri (6-10AM) in the mornings, Vanessa Miller (10AM-2PM) in the afternoons, Taylor Scott (2-7PM) in the evenings, and John Tesh from 7PM to Midnight.

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, nausea, hyper-excitability, irritability, and anxiety. While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood, several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation, changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation and malnutrition. Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role. The symptoms occur after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off, generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking. Though many possible remedies and folk cures have been suggested, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover. The socioeconomic consequences and health risks of alcohol hangover include workplace absenteeism, impaired job performance, reduced productivity and poor academic achievement. A hangover may also impair performance during potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Signs and symptoms A painting from 1681 showing a person affected by vomiting, a typical symptom of alcohol hangover An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include drowsiness, headache, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, sweating, nausea, hyper-excitability, anxiety, and a feeling of general discomfort that may last more than 24 hours. Alcohol hangover symptoms develop when blood alcohol concentration falls considerably and peak when it returns to almost zero. Hangover symptoms validated in controlled studies include general malaise, thirst, headache, feeling dizzy or faint, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach ache, and feeling as though one's heart is racing. Some symptoms such as changes in sleep pattern and gastrointestinal distress are attributed to direct effects of the alcohol intoxication, or withdrawal symptoms. Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover. Causes The processes which lead to hangovers are still poorly understood. Several pathophysiological changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde, hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease of the availability of glucose. Additional associated phenomena are dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation and insufficient eating. Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some, such as methanol, are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid. =Pathophysiology= Alcohol flush reaction as a result of the accumulation of acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of alcohol After being ingested, the ethanol in alcoholic beverages is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation and egestion process. These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction. By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system, alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult. Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes in the human body include increased triglyceride production, increased amino acid catabolism, inhibition of the citric acid cycle, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, hyperuricemia, disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis. The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced. However, recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketone bodies, cortisol, and glucose in blood and urine samples. Alcohol also induces the CYP2E1 enzyme, which metabolizes ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins. In particular, in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell death. =Acetaldehyde= Acetaldehyde, the first by-product of ethanol, is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption. In addition, certain genetic factors can amplify the negative effects of acetaldehyde. For example, some people (predominantly East Asians) have a mutation in their alcohol dehydrogenase gene that makes this enzyme unusually fast at converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. In addition, about half of all East Asians convert acetaldehyde to acetic acid more slowly (via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), causing a higher buildup of acetaldehyde than normally seen in other groups. The high concentration of acetaldehyde causes the alcohol flush reaction, colloquially known as the \\"Asian Flush\\". Since the alcohol flush reaction is highly uncomfortable and the possibility of hangovers is immediate and severe, people with this gene variant are less likely to become alcoholics. Finlandia vodka have a lower concentration of congeners Acetaldehyde may also influence glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme, and increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress. Likewise, acetic acid (or the acetate ion) can cause additional problems. One study found that injecting sodium acetate into rats caused them to have nociceptive behavior (headaches). In addition, there is a biochemical explanation for this finding. High acetate levels cause adenosine to accumulate in many parts of the brain. But when the rats were given caffeine, which blocks the action of adenosine, they no longer experienced headaches.[ =Congeners= In addition to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain congeners, either as flavoring or as a by- product of fermentation and the wine aging process. While ethanol is by itself sufficient to produce most hangover effects, congeners may potentially aggravate hangover and other residual effects to some extent. Congeners include substances such as amines, amides, acetones, acetaldehydes, polyphenols, methanol, histamines, fusel oil, esters, furfural, and tannins, many but not all of which are toxic. One study in mice indicates that fusel oil may have a mitigating effect on hangover symptoms, while some whiskey congeners such as butanol protect the stomach against gastric mucosal damage in the rat. Different types of alcoholic beverages contain different amounts of congeners. In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration. Whereas vodka has virtually no more congeners than pure ethanol, bourbon has a total congener content 37 times higher than that found in vodka. Several studies have examined whether certain types of alcohol cause worse hangovers. All four studies concluded that darker liquors, which have higher congeners, produced worse hangovers. One even showed that hangovers were worse and more frequent with darker liquors. In a 2006 study, an average of 14 standard drinks (330 ml each) of beer was needed to produce a hangover, but only 7 to 8 drinks was required for wine or liquor (note that one standard drink has the same amount of alcohol regardless of type). Another study ranked several drinks by their ability to cause a hangover as follows (from low to high): distilled ethanol diluted with fruit juice, beer, vodka, gin, white wine, whisky, rum, red wine and brandy. One potent congener is methanol. It is naturally formed in small quantities during fermentation and it can be accidentally concentrated by improper distillation techniques. Metabolism of methanol produces some extremely toxic compounds, such as formaldehyde and formic acid, which may play a role in the severity of hangover. Ethanol slows the conversion of methanol into its toxic metabolites so that most of the methanol can be excreted harmlessly in the breath and urine without forming its toxic metabolites. This may explain the temporary postponement of symptoms reported in the common remedy of drinking more alcohol to relieve hangover symptoms. Since methanol metabolism is effectively inhibited by consumption of alcohol, methanol accumulates during drinking and only begins to be metabolized once ethanol has been cleared. This delayed action makes it an attractive candidate explanation for delayed post- intoxication symptoms and correlations between methanol concentrations and the presence of hangover symptoms that have been found in studies. = Vitamin and electrolyte loss = The metabolic processes required for alcohol elimination deplete essential vitamins and electrolytes. Furthermore, alcohol is a diuretic, causing excretion of electrolytes through urination. After a night of drinking, the resulting lack of key B and C vitamins, as well as potassium, magnesium, and zinc may cause fatigue, aching and other hangover-like symptoms. =Dehydration= Ethanol has a dehydrating effect by causing increased urine production (diuresis), which could cause thirst, dry mouth, dizziness and may lead to an electrolyte imbalance. Studies suggest that electrolyte changes play only a minor role in the genesis of the alcohol hangover and are caused by dehydration effects. Drinking water may help relieve symptoms as a result of dehydration but it is unlikely that rehydration significantly reduces the presence and severity of alcohol hangover. Alcohol's effect on the stomach lining can account for nausea because alcohol stimulates the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. = Low blood sugar = Studies show that alcohol hangover is associated with a decrease in blood glucose concentration (less than 70 ml/dl), but the relationship between blood glucose concentration and hangover severity is unclear. Also known as insulin shock, hypoglycemia can lead to coma or even death. = Immune system = In current research, the significant relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied. An imbalance of the immune system, in particular of cytokine metabolism has been identified as playing a role in the pathophysiology of the hangover state. Especially the hangover symptoms nausea, headache, and fatigue have been suggested to be mediated by changes in the immune system. The concentration of several cytokines have been found to be significantly increased in the blood after alcohol consumption. These include interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFNŒ≥) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Some pharmacological studies such as on tolfenamic acid and Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) have also indicated an involvement of the immune system. These studies suggest that the presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as aspirin or ibuprofen. = Person-related factors = Several factors which do not in themselves cause alcohol hangover are known to influence its severity. These factors include personality, genetics, health status, age, sex, associated activities during drinking such as smoking, the use of other drugs, physical activity such as dancing, as well as sleep quality and duration. *Genetics: alleles associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and flushing phenotypes (alcohol flush reaction) in Asians are known genetic factors that influence alcohol tolerance and the development of hangover effects. Existing data shows that drinkers with genotypes known to lead to acetaldehyde accumulation are more susceptible to hangover effects. The fact that about 25% of heavy drinkers claim that they have never had a hangover is also an indication that genetic variation plays a role in individual differences of hangover severity. *Age: some people experience hangovers as getting worse as one ages. This is thought to be caused by declining supplies of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in metabolizing alcohol. Although it is actually unknown whether hangover symptoms and severity change with age, research shows that drinking patterns change across ages, and heavy drinking episodes that may result in hangover are much less often experienced as age increases. *Sex: at the same number of drinks, women are more prone to hangover than men, and this is likely explained by sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. Women attain a higher blood alcohol concentration (BAC) than men at the same number of drinks. At equivalent BACs, men and women appear to be indistinguishable with respect to most hangover effects. *Cigarette smoking: acetaldehyde which is absorbed from cigarette smoking during alcohol consumption is regarded as a contributor to alcohol hangover symptoms. Management Hangovers are poorly understood from a medical point of view. Health care professionals prefer to study alcohol abuse from a standpoint of treatment and prevention, and there is a view that the hangover provides a useful, natural and intrinsic disincentive to excessive drinking. Within the limited amount of serious study on the subject, there is debate about whether a hangover may be prevented or at least mitigated. There is also a vast body of folk medicine and simple quackery. A four-page literature review in the British Medical Journal concludes: \\"No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to avoid drinking.\\" Most remedies do not significantly reduce overall hangover severity. Some compounds reduce specific symptoms such as vomiting and headache, but are not effective in reducing other common hangover symptoms such as drowsiness and fatigue. =Potentially beneficial= A bottle of Aspirin from 1899 Some sources indicate there is no evidence that any treatments for hangovers are effective. * Rehydration: Drinking water before going to bed or during hangover may relieve dehydration-associated symptoms such as thirst, dizziness, dry mouth, and headache. * Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen have been proposed as a treatment for the headaches associated with a hangover. There however is no evidence to support a benefit, and there are concerns that taking alcohol and aspirin together may increase the risk of stomach bleeding and liver damage. * Tolfenamic acid, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, in a 1983 study reduced headache, nausea, vomiting, irritation but had no effect on tiredness in 30 people. * Pyritinol: A 1973 study found that large doses (several hundred times the recommended daily intake) of Pyritinol, a synthetic Vitamin B6 analog, can help to reduce hangover symptoms. Possible side effects of pyritinol include hepatitis (liver damage) due to cholestasis and acute pancreatitis. * Yeast-based extracts: The difference in the change for discomfort, restlessness, and impatience were statistically significant but no significant differences on blood chemistry parameters, blood alcohol or acetaldehyde concentrations have been found, and it did not significantly improve general well-being. =Unsupported remedies= Kudzu roots (Pueraria lobata), a common ingredient in herbal hangover remedies, may have harmful effects when combined with alcohol Recommendations for foods, drinks and activities to relieve hangover symptoms abound. The ancient Romans, on the authority of Pliny the Elder, favored raw owl's eggs or fried canary, while the \\"prairie oyster\\" restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, calls for raw egg yolk mixed with Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper. By 1938, the Ritz- Carlton Hotel provided a hangover remedy in the form of a mixture of Coca-Cola and milk (Coca-Cola itself having been invented, by some accounts, as a hangover remedy). Alcoholic writer Ernest Hemingway relied on tomato juice and beer. Other purported hangover cures include cocktails such as Bloody Mary or Black Velvet (consisting of equal parts champagne and stout). A 1957 survey by an American folklorist found widespread belief in the efficacy of heavy fried foods, tomato juice and sexual activity. Other untested or discredited treatments include: * Hair of the dog: The belief is that consumption of further alcohol after the onset of a hangover will relieve symptoms, based upon the theory that the hangover represents a form of alcohol withdrawal and that by satiating the body's need for alcohol the symptoms will be relieved. Social drinkers and alcoholics claim that drinking more alcohol gives relief from hangover symptoms, but research shows that the use of alcohol as a hangover cure seems to predict current or future problem drinking and alcohol use disorder, through negative reinforcement and the development of physical dependence. While the practice is popular in tradition and promoted by many sellers of alcoholic beverages, medical opinion holds that the practice merely postpones the symptoms, and courts addiction. Favored choices include a Corpse Reviver, Fernet Branca and Bloody Mary. * Kudzu (Ëëõ, Pueraria montana var. lobata): The main ingredient in remedies such as kakkonto. A study concluded, \\"The chronic usage of Pueraria lobata at times of high ethanol consumption, such as in hangover remedies, may predispose subjects to an increased risk of acetaldehyde-related neoplasm and pathology. ... Pueraria lobata appears to be an inappropriate herb for use in herbal hangover remedies as it is an inhibitor of ALDH2.\\" * Artichoke: Research shows that artichoke extract does not prevent the signs and symptoms of alcohol-induced hangover. * Sauna or steam-bath: Medical opinion holds this may be dangerous, as the combination of alcohol and hyperthermia increases the likelihood of dangerous abnormal heart rhythms. * Oxygen: There have been anecdotal reports from those with easy access to a breathing oxygen supply ‚Äì medical staff, and military pilots ‚Äî that oxygen can also reduce the symptoms of hangovers sometimes caused by alcohol consumption. The theory is that the increased oxygen flow resulting from oxygen therapy improves the metabolic rate, and thus increases the speed at which toxins are broken down. However, one source states that (in an aviation context) oxygen has no effect on physical impairment caused by hangover. * Fructose and glucose: Glucose and fructose significantly inhibit the metabolic changes produced by alcohol intoxication, nevertheless they have no significant effect on hangover severity. * Vitamin B6: No effects on alcohol metabolism, peak blood alcohol and glucose concentrations have been found and psychomotor function is not significantly improved when using Vitamin B6 supplements. * Caffeinated drinks: No significant correlation between caffeine use and hangover severity has been found.  Epidemiology  Hangovers occur commonly. *A 1990 study of students at a rural New England university found that 25% had experienced a hangover in the previous week and 29% reported losing school time for hangover recovery. *Fifteen percent of men and women who have consumed alcohol experience hangovers at least monthly and 10% of British men reported hangover-related problems at work at least monthly. *An estimated 9.23% (11.6 million workers) of the U.S. labor force work with a hangover. *About 23% of drinkers do not report any hangover after drinking to intoxication.  Society and culture  A somewhat dated French idiomatic expression for hangover is \\"mal aux cheveux\\", literally \\"sore hair\\" (or \\"[even] my hair hurts\\"). In the 19th century United States, a hangover was sometimes called a Katzenjammer from the German for \\"screeching cats\\". Some terms for 'hangover' are derived from names for liquor, for example, in Chile a hangover is known as a ca√±a from a Spanish slang term for a glass of beer. Similar is the Irish 'brown bottle flu' derived from the type of bottle common to beer. Alcohol hangover has considerable economic consequences. A British study found that alcohol use accounted for 3.3 billion (USD) in lost wages each year, as a result of work missed because of hangovers. In Canada 1.4 billion (USD) is lost each year because of decreased occupational productivity caused by hangover-like symptoms. In Finland, a country with a population of 5 million persons, over 1 million workdays are lost each year because of hangovers. The average annual opportunity cost due to hangovers are estimated as 2000 (USD) per working adult. The socioeconomic implications of an alcohol hangover include workplace absenteeism, impaired job performance, reduced productivity and poor academic achievement. Potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery are also negatively influenced. In mid-2017, it was reported that one company in the UK allows sick days when hung over.Liz Connor,London company is offering 'hangover' sick days to its staff\\",Evening Standard, 24 August 2017 Research Psychological research of alcohol hangover is growing rapidly.

Biography Weightman was born on September 30, 1813 in Waltham, Lincolnshire, England. At the invitation of his uncle, chemist John Farr, he immigrated to the United States in 1829, at age 16. Farr had founded the firm Farr and Kunzi, the first manufacturers of sulfate of quinine in the United States. Upon Kunzi's retirement in 1836, Farr partnered with Thomas Powers and 27-year-old Weightman to establish Farr, Powers and Weightman, manufacturing chemists. Powers & Weightman advertisement, 1859. When John Farr died in 1847, Weightman became an administrator and executive of the business, which was renamed Powers and Weightman, chemical manufacturers. Powers & Weightman developed a synthetic form of quinine, a prophylaxis for malaria. With importation of British quinine cut off during the Civil War, the company profited greatly through a quasi monopoly.

Having outlived his two physician sons, Farr and William, Weightman came to rely on his daughter, Anne Weightman Walker. Following her husband's death in 1903, she was admitted as a partner in Powers & Weightman, \\"the only woman in the United States to hold such a position of responsible trust\\". =Personal= Weightman married Louisa Stillwagon in 1841. Together, they had three children: John, William Jr., and Anne.William Weightman from Find-A-Grave Weightman died at age 90 on August 25, 1904, at Ravenhill. He left the bulk of his estate to his surviving child, Anne. Ravenhill was inherited by Anne Weightman Walker, who donated the estate to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in 1910. Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty of the Archdiocese granted the Mansion to an order of nuns, the Religious of the Assumption, in 1919. The sisters converted the mansion into a school and named it Ravenhill Academy. Legacy Weightman Hall (left) and Franklin Field in 1922 A posthumous portrait of William Weightman was also commissioned by his daughter Anne Weightman from the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury; it was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington and in Philadelphia in 1908. The University of Pennsylvania gymnasium, Weightman Hall (1903‚Äì05, Frank Miles Day, architect), adjacent to Franklin Field, is named for him. \\"Ravenhill,\\" the Weightman mansion in West Germantown, is now part of Thomas Jefferson University.

He made his professional debut in March 1998. His highest rank was maegashira 9. He was well known for moving between the top makuuchi division and the second j≈´ry≈ç division on several occasions. He won two makushita and two j≈´ry≈ç division championships. He retired in September 2016 and is now a sumo coach. Early life and sumo background Born in Nagoya, he started sumo in the fourth grade of elementary school. He was enrolled by his father in the Choyko Sumo Club, based in the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium where the annual Nagoya honbasho is held. At Hibino Middle School, he became Middle School Yokozuna in 1997. He made his professional debut in March 1998, joining Kataonami stable. Just weeks beforehand, his father had died of a heart attack. It had been he who had chosen Tamaasuka's ring name or shikona and had driven him to become a wrestler by installing a rigorous training program for him. His father's death only made Tamaasuka more determined to succeed in professional sumo. Career After six years of steady but unspectacular progress in the lower ranks, Tamaasuka was promoted to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in November 2004 after winning the makushita championship with a perfect 7-0 record. In his j≈´ry≈ç debut he scored eight wins against seven losses by winning and then losing on alternate days, an oddity not seen in the top two divisions since 1988. He reached the top makuuchi division in the Nagoya tournament in July 2005, making his debut alongside Hakurozan. He was the first wrestler from Nagoya to reach the top division since Tochitsukasa in 1981. Cheered on by his hometown fans, Tamaasuka scored nine wins in his top division debut. He would have received the Kant≈ç-sh≈ç or Fighting Spirit Prize had he won on the final day, but he was defeated by Tokitenk≈´. He was promoted to maegashira 9, but could only manage a disappointing 4-11 record in the next tournament. On the fourth day of the November 2005 tournament he broke his left ankle and was forced to pull out. As a result, he was demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division. It was the first time in his career that he had missed any bouts. Since he had an enforced layoff, he decided to undergo eyesight corrective surgery in December 2005.[sumo] [spoiler]Tamaasuka He had not fully recovered from either his injury or his surgery by the January 2006 tournament but felt he had to compete to try to prevent demotion to the unsalaried makushita division. However, in the event he withdrew once again after losing his first two bouts. He largely remained in the third division for the next three years. In May 2008 he won his second makushita division championship, once more with a perfect 7-0 record. This performance returned him to the sekitori ranks for the first time since November 2006. His return was not successful however, as he could only manage a 5-10 score at j≈´ry≈ç 13. He returned to the j≈´ry≈ç division once again for the November 2008 tournament; a 6-1 score at the rank of makushita 4 elevating him to j≈´ry≈ç 8. Although he turned in 5-10 again, it was enough on this occasion to keep him in the division. However a further 5-10 score in January 2009 saw him demoted once again. He scored 6-1 in March 2009, losing a playoff for the makushita division championship, which was enough for an immediate return to j≈´ry≈ç. In May 2009 he not only made his first kachi-koshi at a sekitori rank in nearly four years but won his first j≈´ry≈ç championship with a 12-3 record. He followed up with another strong 11-4 record in July 2009, ensuring himself of a return to the top division for the first time in nearly four years. The 23 tournaments it took him to win back promotion is the fifth longest ever, behind Satoyama, Wakanoyama, Daihi and Daizen. In the September 2009 tournament, fighting from the maegashira 13 ranking, he recovered from 3-9 to win his last three matches and stay in the top division. He was forced to withdraw from the following tournament in November, his first absence since January 2006, after injuring his right ankle and he fell back to j≈´ry≈ç as a result. He won promotion back to the top division for July 2010 after a 10-5 score in May, but could manage only five wins on his return. Two poor performances of 5-10 and 4-11 saw him demoted to makushita for the first time since January 2009 after the November 2010 tournament, but he won promotion back to the sekitori ranks immediately. In September 2011 Tamaasuka was promoted back to makuuchi after scoring 8-7 at j≈´ry≈ç 1in the preceding July tournament. He thus became the second wrestler (after Wakanoyama) to twice achieve the feat of returning to makuuchi after dropping to makushita. Once again he lasted only one tournament back in the top division. He won his second j≈´ry≈ç championship in May 2012 with a score of 12‚Äì3 and secured promotion back to makuuchi, but produced his worst performance in the top division to date in the following tournament, winning only two bouts. However, he responded by earning a sixth promotion to the top division for January 2013, but was demoted after only one tournament. After two more tournaments in j≈´ry≈ç he received his seventh promotion to the top division and this time was able to remain there for his longest stint yet of three tournaments before being demoted again. He did not manage to reach makuuchi in 2014 and had an even less successful year in 2015, losing sekitori status after the November 2015 tournament for the first time in five years. He won promotion back to j≈´ry≈ç after the March 2016 tournament. He said that his ambition for the remainder of his career was to earn another kachi-koshi or winning score in the top division, something which he only achieved once, in his makuuchi debut in 2005. However May 2016 turned out to be his final tournament at sekitori level. Retirement from sumo Tamaasuka retired after the September 2016 tournament, after a record of 4-3 at makushita 9. His career record was 580 wins against 569 losses, with 29 absences due to injury. His top division record was 54-109-17. Of his 111 career tournaments 51 were at sekitori level, with 12 in the makuuchi division and 39 in j≈´ry≈ç. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, initially known as Araiso Oyakata. In April 2018 he switched to the Kumagatani name. He works as a coach at Kataonami stable. Fighting style Tamaasuka was proficient in both yotsu- sumo (grappling) and oshi-sumo (pushing and thrusting) techniques. He used oshi techniques at the beginning of a match to set up his preferred yotsu position, a basic sumo style. His favoured grip on his opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most often used winning kimarite was yori-kiri (force out), followed by oshi-dashi (push out). Personal life Tamaasuka is married with three sons. He has said that he would like at least one of his sons to follow him into professional sumo, and also use the Tamaasuka shikona that was given to him by his own late father.

Eggers & Higgins was a New York architectural firm partnered by Otto Reinhold Eggers (1882‚Äì1964) and Daniel Paul Higgins (1886‚Äì1953). The architects were responsible for the construction phase of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial beginning in 1939, two years after the death of its original architect, John Russell Pope, despite protests that their appointment had been undemocratic and therefore \\"un-Jeffersonian\\". Critics argued a competition should have been held to choose Pope's successor. In 1941, they also completed construction of Pope's other famous design, the West Building of the National Gallery of Art, also in Washington D.C.. The pair were longtime associates of Pope in the firm he founded in 1903 as the Office of John Russell Pope, Architect. Eggers was a brilliant designer and renderer who served as Pope's right hand for almost thirty years. They changed the name of the firm to Eggers & Higgins in 1937, soon after Pope's death. The firm was renamed The Eggers Partnership in 1970, and then as The Eggers Group, PC when it became a professional corporation in 1976. It eventually merged into what is now RMJM Hillier, a leading architectural firm with offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia. Indiana University Auditorium in 1942 Eggers & Higgins also designed the Brooklyn War Memorial, a classical stone building in Cadman Plaza dedicated to Brooklynites who fought in World War II. At the same time, they also designed the Vanderbilt Law School Building, now Vanderbilt Hall of the New York University School of Law. For the 1939 New York World's Fair they designed the Railroads Building, the largest at the Fair, and the Schaefer center, a restaurant seating 1600 with a long open-air bar. In Lincoln Center the firm developed Damrosch Park, an outdoor amphitheater with a bowl-style stage known as the Guggenheim Band Shell. In addition to their planning role with New York University on the redevelopment of Washington Square, the firm was also engaged with Indiana University as their primary architects for more than 30 years. They designed all the major buildings on the Bloomington campus from the Indiana University Auditorium completed in 1941, until they were replaced on the musical arts center project in 1962. Their major campus building designs included the Fine Arts Building, Lilly Library, the Stadium and Assembly Hall. They were also tapped for the development of the Indiana University School of Medicine campus including the Indiana University Hospital building. In 1948, Eggers was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1951.

It follows Roy, Susan and Amber Yakkel and their struggle to embrace English culture in Suffolk. Over the course of the show the troubles the family have in settling into life in England are documented, including the hostility that the locals show towards the Americans in their village. It is currently being shown on Sky3 and is repeated several times during the week. This is the story about a family from Oklahoma who have been stationed on the UK‚Äôs largest RAF airbase, ‚ÄòLakenheath‚Äô, home to the F15 fighter jet and 5,000 US citizens. Ron is a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and is in charge of logistics and personnel for Africa operations. He thought about retiring and joining the Peace Corps until he was ordered to go to England. The programme observes how the family copes with life outside of the wire-circled frontier away from the sugar-coated, ideal American life with its Burger King, US currency, movie theatre and rod and gun club. Ron is happy to soak up the novelties of living in the English countryside but his life is not that affected by the change as he spends most of his day on the reassuring airbase. It is Susan, his wife, and Amber, his teenage daughter that really have to face the challenges of fitting in. This proves to be particularly hard as the locals show hostility to the very presence of the Americans in the village. Amber attends the local school where rebellious teenagers refuse to sing the ‚ÄòStars and Stripes‚Äô, not forgetting Mr Dawson, the eccentric psychology teacher, with his CND posters and lessons on the decline of religious doctrine. Thankfully Susan and Amber find comfort back at the airbase‚Äôs local cheerleader group but a trip to Blackpool soon shakes their confidence. ‚ÄòBombs, Brits and Cheerleaders‚Äô is an entertaining analysis of how an American family struggle to embrace the English culture.

Initial symptoms include psychiatric problems, behavioral changes, and painful sensations. In the later stages of the illness, patients may exhibit poor coordination, dementia and involuntary movements. The length of time between exposure and the development of symptoms is unclear, but is believed to be years. Average life expectancy following the onset of symptoms is 13 months. It is caused by prions, which are mis-folded proteins. Spread is believed to be primarily due to eating bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected beef. Infection is also believed to require a specific genetic susceptibility. Spread may potentially also occur via blood products or contaminated surgical equipment. Diagnosis is by brain biopsy but can be suspected based on certain other criteria. It is different from classic Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, though both are due to prions. Treatment for vCJD involves supportive care. As of 2012, about 170 cases of vCJD have been recorded in the United Kingdom, due to a 1990s outbreak, and 50 cases in the rest of the world. The disease has become less common since 2000. The typical age of onset is less than 30 years old. It was first identified in 1996 by the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, Scotland. Signs and symptoms Initial symptoms include psychiatric problems, behavioral changes, and painful sensations. In the later stages of the illness, patients may exhibit poor coordination, dementia and involuntary movements. The length of time between exposure and the development of symptoms is unclear, but is believed to be years. Average life expectancy following the onset of symptoms is 13 months. Cause =Tainted beef= In the UK, the primary cause of vCJD has been eating beef tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. A 2012 study by the Health Protection Agency showed that around 1 in 2,000 people in the UK shows signs of abnormal prion accumulation. Jonathan D. Quick, M.D. instructor of medicine at the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, states that bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE is the first man-made epidemic, or \\"Frankenstein\\" disease, because a human decision to feed meat and bone meal to previously herbivorous cattle (as a source of protein) caused what was previously an animal pathogen to enter into the human food chain, and from there to begin causing humans to contract vCJD. =Blood products= As of 2018, evidence suggests that while there may be prions in the blood of individuals with vCJD, this is not the case in individuals with sporadic CJD. In 2004, a report showed that vCJD can be transmitted by blood transfusions. The finding alarmed healthcare officials because a large epidemic of the disease could result in the near future. A blood test for vCJD infection is possible but is not yet available for screening blood donations. Significant restrictions exist to protect the blood supply. The UK government banned anyone who had received a blood transfusion since January 1980 from donating blood. Since 1999 there has been a ban in the UK for using UK blood to manufacture fractional products such as albumin. Whilst these restrictions may go some way to preventing a self-sustaining epidemic of secondary infections the number of infected blood donations is unknown and could be considerable. In June 2013 the government was warned that deaths‚Äîthen at 176‚Äîcould rise five-fold through blood transfusions. On May 28, 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration instituted a policy that excludes from donation anyone having spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy have relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries (six months or more if military). The three-month restriction on travel to the UK, however, has not been changed. In New Zealand, the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS) in 2000 introduced measures to preclude permanently donors having resided in the United Kingdom (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) for a total of six months or more between January 1980 and December 1996. The measure resulted in ten percent of New Zealand's active blood donors at the time becoming ineligible to donate blood. In 2003, the NZBS further extended restrictions to permanently preclude donors having received a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom since January 1980, and in April 2006, restrictions were further extended to include the Republic of Ireland and France. Similar regulations are in place where anyone having spent more than six months for Germany or one year for France living in the UK between January 1980 and December 1996 is permanently banned from donating blood. English via Google Translate In Canada, individuals are not eligible to donate blood or plasma if they have spent a cumulative total of three months or more in the UK or France from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1996. They are also ineligible if they have spent a cumulative total of five years or more in Western Europe outside the UK or France since January 1, 1980 through December 31, 2007 or spent a cumulative total of six months or more in Saudi Arabia from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 1996 or if they have had a blood transfusion in the UK, France or Western Europe since 1980. In Poland, anyone having spent cumulatively six months or longer between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 in the UK, Ireland, or France is permanently barred from donating. In the Czech Republic, anyone having spent more than six months in the UK or France between the years 1980 and 1996 or received transfusion in the UK after the year 1980 is not allowed to donate blood. In Finland, anyone having lived or stayed in the British Isles a total of over six months between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 is permanently barred from donating. =Sperm donation= In the U.S., the FDA has banned import of any donor sperm, motivated by a risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, inhibiting the once popular import of Scandinavian sperm. Despite this, the scientific consensus is that the risk is negligible, as there is no evidence Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob is sexually transmitted. =Other types of brains= Eating other types of brains such as those from squirrels is not recommended due to potential concerns. Mechanism Despite the consumption of contaminated beef in the UK being high, vCJD has infected a small number of people. One explanation for this can be found in the genetics of people with the disease. The human PRNP protein which is subverted in prion disease can occur with either methionine or valine at amino acid 129, without any apparent difference in normal function. Of the overall Caucasian population, about 40% have two methionine-containing alleles, 10% have two valine-containing alleles, and the other 50% are heterozygous at this position. Only a single person with vCJD tested was found to be heterozygous; most of those affected had two copies of the methionine-containing form. It is not yet known whether those unaffected are actually immune or only have a longer incubation period until symptoms appear. Diagnosis Electroencephalogram of a person with suspected CJD showing typical periodic bursts of triphasic sharp waves =Definitive= Examination of brain tissue is required to confirm a diagnosis of variant CJD. The following confirmatory features should be present: * Numerous widespread kuru-type amyloid plaques surrounded by vacuoles in both the cerebellum and cerebrum ‚Äì florid plaques. * Spongiform change and extensive prion protein deposition shown by immunohistochemistry throughout the cerebellum and cerebrum. =Suspected= * Current age or age at death less than 55 years (a brain autopsy is recommended, however, for all physician-diagnosed CJD cases). * Psychiatric symptoms at illness onset and/or persistent painful sensory symptoms (frank pain and/or dysesthesia). * Dementia, and development ‚â•4 months after illness onset of at least two of the following five neurologic signs: poor coordination, myoclonus, chorea, hyperreflexia, or visual signs. (If persistent painful sensory symptoms exist, ‚â•4 months' delay in the development of the neurologic signs is not required). * A normal or an abnormal EEG, but not the diagnostic EEG changes often seen in classic CJD. * Duration of illness of over 6 months. * Routine investigations do not suggest an alternative, non-CJD diagnosis. * No history of getting human pituitary growth hormone or a dura mater graft from a cadaver. * No history of CJD in a first degree relative or prion protein gene mutation in the person. =Classification= vCJD is a separate condition from classic Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease (though both are caused by PrP prions). Both classic and variant CJD are subtypes of Creutzfeld‚ÄìJakob disease. There are three main categories of CJD disease: sporadic CJD, hereditary CJD, and acquired CJD, with variant CJD being in the acquired group along with iatrogenic CJD. The classic form includes sporadic and hereditary forms. Sporadic CJD is the most common type. ICD-10 has no separate code for vCJD and such cases are reported under the Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease code (A81.0). Epidemiology Dark green areas are countries that have confirmed human cases of variant Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease and light green are countries that have bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases The Lancet in 2006 suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of kuru, a similar disease in Papua New Guinea. The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through cannibalism in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of mourning. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea. In the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar incubation period of 20 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. Fifteen years later Jared Diamond was informed by Papuans that the practice continued. Kuru may have passed to the Fore people through the preparation of the dead body for burial. These researchers noticed a genetic variation in some people with kuru that has been known to promote long incubation periods. They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This means that there may be many more people with vCJD with longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later. Prion protein is detectable in lymphoid and appendix tissue up to two years before the onset of neurological symptoms in vCJD. Large scale studies in the UK have yielded an estimated prevalence of 493 per million, higher than the actual number of reported cases. This finding indicates a large number of asymptomatic cases and the need to monitor. Society and culture In 1997, a number of people from Kentucky developed vCJD. It was discovered that all had consumed squirrel brains, although a coincidental relationship between the disease and this dietary practice may have been involved. In 2008, UK scientists expressed concern over the possibility of a second wave of human cases due to the wide exposure and long incubation of some cases of vCJD. In 2015, a man from New York developed vCJD after eating squirrel brains. From November 2017 to April 2018, four suspected cases of the disease arose in Rochester. =United Kingdom= Deaths in the UK from Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease 1990‚Äì2014: while cases of vCJD have declined (green), reported cases of sporadic CJD continue to increase (blue) Researchers believe one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef (vCJD). The survey provides the most robust prevalence measure to date‚Äîand identifies abnormal prion protein across a wider age group than found previously and in all genotypes, indicating \\"infection\\" may be relatively common. This new study examined over 32,000 anonymous appendix samples. Of these, 16 samples were positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population, or one in 2,000 people are likely to be carriers. No difference was seen in different birth cohorts (1941‚Äì1960 and 1961‚Äì1985), in both sexes, and there was no apparent difference in abnormal prion prevalence in three broad geographical areas. Genetic testing of the 16 positive samples revealed a higher proportion of valine homozygous (VV) genotype on the codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) compared with the general UK population. This also differs from the 176 people with vCJD, all of whom to date have been methionine homozygous (MM) genotype. The concern is that individuals with this VV genotype may be susceptible to developing the condition over longer incubation periods. =Human BSE foundation= Commemorative plaque in London paying tribute to people who died from vCJD In 2000 a voluntary support group was formed by families who had lost someone to vCJD. The goal was to support other families going through a similar experience. This support was provided through a National Helpline, a Carer's Guide, a website and a network of family befriending. The support groups had an internet presence at the turn of the 21st century. The driving force behind the foundation was Lester Firkins, who lost his own young son to the disease. In October 2000 the report of the government inquiry into BSE chaired by Lord Phillips was published. The BSE report criticised former Conservative Party Agriculture Ministers John Gummer, John MacGregor and Douglas Hogg. The report concluded that the escalation of BSE into a crisis was the result of intensive farming, particularly with herbivore cows being fed with cow and sheep remains. Furthermore, the report was critical of the way the crisis had been handled. There was a reluctance to consider the possibility that BSE could cross the species barrier. The government assured the public that British beef was safe to eat, with agriculture minister John Gummer famously feeding his daughter a beefburger. The British government were reactive more than proactive in response; the worldwide ban on all British beef exports in March 1996 was a serious economic blow. The foundation had been calling for compensation to include a care package to help relatives look after those with vCJD. There have been widespread complaints of inadequate health and social services support. Following the Phillips Report in October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for British people affected with vCJD. The multi-million- pound financial package was overseen by the vCJD Trust. A memorial plaque for persons who have died due to vCJD was installed in central London. It is located on the boundary wall of St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth facing the Riverside Walk of Albert Embankment.

He is considered one of the 100 wealthiest Americans, having left an enormous fortune.The Wealthy 100 at www.scottwinslow.com Early life Oliver Hazard Payne was born on July 21, 1839 in Cleveland, Ohio. He was the son of Henry B. Payne, a businessman, U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator, and Mary (n√©e Perry) Payne. He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, a relative of his mother. He was the uncle of William Payne Whitney and Harry Payne Whitney. He was also the uncle of Congresswoman Frances Payne Bolton. Payne was educated at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1859. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. Career In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Payne enlisted in the Union Army. By 1863, he was colonel of the 124th Ohio Infantry. He was Brevetted Brigadier General March 13, 1865. Payne began his career shortly after the war, investing in iron and then oil refining. His oil interests were the first acquired by Standard Oil, and he became a trustee of that firm. He was charged with bribing members of the Ohio Legislature to attain a Senate seat for his father (before the U.S. Senate was directly elected), and with bribing the Democratic Party to name his brother-in-law United States Secretary of the Navy, though the charges were dropped. =Yachting= Payne was a yachtsman and built the steam yacht Aphrodite in 1898.

Grinspoon prove that they certainly still have a semblance of ‚Äòit‚Äô but ‚Äòit‚Äô is being translated through safer, more accessible means.\\" The review describes \\"Jamieson as \\"soar(ing) through the chorus\\" and \\"the song is full of catchy hooks that are bound to get people a-moving on the dance floor at the band‚Äôs gigs. There is an element of cheesiness there, particularly in the line ‚Äòhow come you never wanna dance with me anymore?‚Äô, but this is strangely one of the most fun lines to sing along to.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Hold on Me\\" starts with Phil Jamieson giving a quick run-down of how the song came about. Apart from the opening image, the clip is in black-and-white and resembles a 60's TV performance.

They are sometimes collectively known as the \\"outstanding five in Cantonese\\" (). These five words are generally offensive and give rise to a variety of euphemisms and minced oaths. Similar to the seven dirty words in the United States, these five words are forbidden to say and are bleep-censored on Hong Kong broadcast television. Other curse phrases, such as puk gai (/) and ham gaa caan (/), are also common. Vulgar words =Diu= The written form of diu commonly seen in Hong Kong Diu (Traditional Chinese: or , Jyutping: diu2), literally meaning fuck, is a common but grossly vulgar profanity in Cantonese. In a manner similar to the English word fuck, diu expresses dismay, disgrace and disapproval. Examples of expressions include diu lei! ( or , fuck you!) and the highly offensive diu lei lou mo! ( or , fuck your mother) or diu lei lo mo chau hai! (, fuck your mother's foul cunt). The word diu was originally a noun meaning the penis and evolved as a verb. Regarded as a grossly vulgar word in Cantonese, the word has gained a new meaning in Taiwan to refer to \\"cool\\". In this context, the Mandarin pronunciation may not be censored on TV broadcasts but the original Cantonese pronunciation is still taboo. Certain euphemisms exist, including siu () (small/little), tsiu (), yiu (). =Gau= Gau ( or ; Jyutping: gau1), sometimes wrongly written as (haau1) or (gou1) despite different pronunciations, is a vulgar Cantonese word which literally means erected cock or cocky. The phrase ngong6 gau1 is an adjective that may be loosely translated as a \\"dumbass\\". Minced variants include ngong6 geoi1, ngong6 kiu1, ngaang6 gaau1 (lit. hard plastic) and \\"on9\\" (used in internet slang). The phrase mou4 lei4 tau4 gau1 () meaning \\"makes no sense\\" was cut to mou4 lei4 tau4 to avoid the sound gau1. Similar to \\"fucking\\" in English, this word is usually used as an adverb. Compare this: * (crazy) * (fucking crazy) Two common euphemisms gau, which only differ in the tone, include gau2 (nine) and gau2 (dog, but it may change the original \\"dumbass\\" meaning into \\"cunning\\" instead). =Lan= Lan ( or ; Jyutping: lan2), sometimes idiomatically written as lun, is another vulgar word that means penis. Similar to gau, this word is also usually used as an adverb. lan yeung ( or ) can be loosely translated as \\"dickface\\". Euphemisms includes laan (lazy) or nang (able to). =Tsat= Tsat ( or or ; Jyutping: cat6), sometimes idiomatically written as , is a vulgar word for an impotent penis. Ban6 cat6 () (stupid dick) is a more common phrase among others. However, it is usually used as a vulgar adjective especially among the youth. It means \\"ugly\\" or \\"shameful\\". cat6 tau4 ( or or ) can be loosely translated as \\"dickhead\\". A common euphemism is cat1 (seven), which only differs in the tone. Other euphemisms include caat3 (to brush) and caak6 (thieves). As a result, thieves that are easily caught by the police are often intentionally described as ban6 caak6 (stupid thieves) in the newspaper to achieve the humorous effects from the phrase ban6 cat6. =Hai= Hai (traditional Chinese: or ; Jyutping: hai1) is a common vulgar word that literally means vagina. The English equivalent is \\"cunt\\". is more common on the mainland of China, with being used in Hong Kong and Macao. The Chinese character consists of two parts: the upper part is that means \\"body\\" while the bottom part means \\"a hole\\". The Chinese character thus literally means a \\"hole at the bottom of the body\\". Two common phrases include so4 hai1 (silly cunt) and cau3 hai1 (stinking cunt). Also another phrase is diu2 hai1 (fuck a pussy). A common euphemism is sai1 (west). The phrase sai1 hau2 sai1 min6 (west mouths and west faces) is often used to describe women who have an impolite look. Some words that are associated with western culture such as sai1 yan4 (Westerners) may become Cantonese jokes that base on the ambiguity of these vocabularies. Other euphemisms include haai4 (shoes) and haai5 (crabs). As a result, crabs are sometimes intentionally linked with other words such as stinking and water to achieve some vagina-related humorous effects. The word hai can also mean total failure as in the phrase hai1 saai3 (). The Chinese character , which in Cantonese is the verbal particle to stress an action. To further stress the failure, sometimes the phrase hai1 gau1 saai3 is used (the word gau that means penis is put in between the original phrase). Since this phrase is highly offensive (it consists two of the five vulgar words), a euphemism or xiehouyu, a kind of Chinese \\"proverb\\", is sometimes used. As in a normal xiehouyu, it consists of two elements: the former segment presents a scenario while the latter provides the rationale thereof. One would often only state the first part, expecting the listener to know the second. The first part is \\"a man and a woman having a sunbath (naked)\\" (). Since the penis and vagina are both exposed to the sun, the second part is hai1 gau1 saai3 ()‚Äîa pun for total failure. Therefore, if one wants to say that something is a total failure, he only has to say , and the listener will understand the intended meaning. Other curse phrases =Puk gaai= The written form of puk gai commonly seen in Hong Kong. Puk gai (, usually idiomatically written as ) literally means \\"falling onto street\\", which is a common curse phrase in Cantonese that may be translated into English as \\"drop dead\\". It is sometimes used as a noun to refer to an annoying person that roughly means a \\"prick\\". The phrase can also be used in daily life under a variety of situations to express annoyance, disgrace or other emotions. Since the phrase does not involve any sexual organs or reference to sex, some argue that it should not be considered as profanity. Nevertheless, \\"PK\\" is often used as a euphemism for the phrase. The written form can be seen on graffiti in Hong Kong and in Guangdong. In Southeast Asia, the meaning of the phrase has evolved so that it is no longer a profanity, and is usually taken to mean \\"broke/bankrupt\\" or \\"epic fail\\". In Taiwan, it is commonly used to refer to planking. The term is even used in a colloquial sense by Malaysian Malays, in which case it is usually rendered as \\"pokai\\". =Ham gaa caan= Ham6 gaa1 caan2 ( or ; Jyutping: ham6 gaa1 caan2) is another common curse phrase in Cantonese that literally means \\"may your whole family be bulldozed\\". caan2 means to be bulldozed, which possibly relates to a funeral and ultimately to the meaning of death. Like puk6 gaai1, the phrase can both be used to mean \\"prick\\" or to express annoyance, but many find ham gaa caan much more offensive than puk gaai, since the phrase targets the listener's whole family instead of just himself. or Ham6 gaa1 ling1, or ham6 gaa1 fu3 gwai3 (may the whole family be rich), or ham gaa ceong (may the whole family be fortunate) are common variant but ling (to take/carry something) has little logical relations with the original phrase. Adding the words ham gaa (whole family) in front of a bless can actually reverse the meaning. The appropriate word for \\"the whole family\\" is cyun gaa to avoid any negative meanings. Legal issues In Hong Kong, there are specific by-laws that forbid the usage of profanity in public. For instance, it is not permitted to \\"use obscene language‚Ä¶ in Ocean Park\\", for which \\"an offence is liable on conviction to a fine at level 1 and to imprisonment for 1 month\\",, \\"Conduct of public\\". while in the MTR, it was prohibited to \\"use any threatening, abusive, obscene or offensive language‚Ä¶ .\\" until 2017., \\"Abusive language\\". However, despite the explicit prohibition by various laws, the exact definition of \\"obscene language\\" is not given in the ordinance.

Her poems have been anthologized many times and are frequently used in textbooks. In 1978 she was awarded the second National Council of Teachers of English Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children.Hopkins, Lee Bennett; Books are by People: Interviews with 104 Authors and Illustrators of Books for Young Children; Citation Press; 1969. Born in Michigan, Fisher moved to Colorado as an adult and lived there for the rest of her life. Life Aileen Fisher was born on September 9, 1906, in Iron River, on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to Nelson E. and Lucia (Milker) Fisher. Her father was a homesteader who established several businesses in the area. Her mother had been a kindergarten teacher. When she was five years old, poor health caused her father to retire to 40 acres near the Iron River in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where he built a home called High Banks. She and her brother, Leslie Paul, spent much of their time playing in the nearby river, walking country roads, and taking care of their farm animals. On Aileen's eighth birthday her baby sister, Lucia, arrived; considering her a birthday present, Aileen soon began taking care of her. Another sister, Beth, was born six years later. Fisher attended the University of Chicago for two years, then transferred to the University of Missouri in order to obtain a BA in journalism in 1927. After graduating she took a summer job in a small theater, then returned to Chicago. She was working as an assistant in a placement bureau for women journalists, then as the director for the Women's National Journalistic Register. In 1933, wanting to live someplace that had beautiful scenery, a good library and an \\"invigorating climate\\", she moved with attorney and fellow writer Olive Rabe to Boulder, Colorado. Five years later they bought a 200-acre ranch in Sunshine Canyon, at the foot of Flagstaff Mountain. They lived there, totally off the grid, for thirty years. An active woman who loved the outdoors, she and Olive designed and built the cabin on their ranch. As Fisher explained in 1948, ‚ÄúWe bought the ranch, built a cabin, got a dog ‚Äî and now we don‚Äôt care if we ever leave Boulder county‚Äù. Her other interests included reading, woodworking, hiking and mountain climbing. Aileen Fisher died at the age of 96 at her home in Boulder, Colorado. Her papers are held in libraries at Southern Mississippi University and Stanford University. Writing According to Fisher, \\"Poetry is a rhythmical piece of writing that leaves the reader feeling that life is a little richer than before, a little more full of wonder, beauty, or just plain delight.\\" And, despite the great variety found in her writing, she thought of herself primarily as a poet. \\"My first and chief love in writing is writing children's verse.\\" The first work she sold, to Child Life magazine in 1927, was \\"Otherwise\\". This nine-line poem, opening \\"There must be magic, Otherwise, How could day turn into night?\\", has been reprinted in a number of anthologies and is still used in schools. Fisher continued to sell to poetry magazines after the publication of her first volume, The Coffee-Pot Face, in 1933. A collection of poems about everyday things like lady bugs, tummy aches and icicles, it was illustrated by her own silhouette drawings, and became a Junior Literary Guild Selection. More than twenty poetry collections followed, including Up the Windy Hill: A Book of Merry Verses with Silhouettes, and You Don‚Äôt Look Like Your Mother, re- released in 2001. Her books have been illustrated by prominent artists including Eric Carle, Adrienne Adams, Symeon Shimin, and Mique Moriuchi. In 1991 Harper Collins published Always Wondering: Some Favorite Poems of Aileen Fisher, selected by the author from some of her most requested and anthologized pieces. I Heard a Bluebird Sing, is a posthumous collection of her poems chosen for inclusion by the votes of school children around the US, along with excerpts from interviews and articles she had written. Fisher's poems continue to appear in anthologies and several of her collections have been re-released after her death, leading her to be included by one reviewer on a short list of \\"some of the luminaries in recent children's poetry\\". Fisher wrote both rhyming and prose non-fiction books, many of them focusing on natural history. One of her personal favorites was Valley of the Smallest: The Life Story of the Shrew, which received the Western Writers of America Spur Award for juvenile non-fiction, was named a Hans Christian Andersen Honor Book, and placed on Horn Book Magazine's Best Books of the Year list. It follows the life of an adult masked shrew living, like Fisher, in a valley in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Other award-winning natural history books include Feathered Ones and Furry, illustrated by Eric Carle, and In the Woods, In the Meadow, In the Sky. Fisher published plays for children, frequently about holidays or with patriotic or historic themes. Some of these were written with other co-writers, including Olive Rabe. They also collaborated on biographies about Emily Dickinson and Louisa May Alcott. She also collaborated with composer George Lynn by writing lyrics for children's Christmas anthems, a song cycle called \\"The Ladybug and Her Friends\\" and a folk opera called \\"The Violinden Tree\\". Critical reception In 1958, New York Times reviewer Anzia Yezierska said that Fisher \\"lights the commonplace moment with wonder.\\" According to the Poetry Foundation, her poems are \\"suffused with curiosity and love for the workings of the natural world.\\" Kirkus Reviews called her verse \\"deftly evocative\\". The New York Times Book Review called her \\"a true poet, no mere light versifier.\\" In I Heard a Bluebird Sing Boyds Mill Press said, \\"her work is forever fresh and timeless. With a child's heart and a knowing hand, she has honed simple words and ideas into small poetic gems that shine with clarity and sensitivity‚Ä¶ This important anthology celebrates the work of one of America's beloved writers for young people.\\" Fisher's natural history rhyming texts were often well received. Of Going Barefoot, a Kirkus reviewer wrote, \\"This rhymed text imparts a substantial amount of naturalist information in a pleasant and animated fashion.\\" The factual content of her books was often praised. About All on a Mountain Day, Saturday Review wrote \\"There is a real feeling for these animals and the part each plays‚Äîthe hunted and the hunters‚Äî in the over-all pattern of nature.\\" Her historical novels have been called \\"rich in detail\\",Steffens, Bradley, Emily Dickinson, Lucent Books, 1998, pg. 89; and \\"emotionally appealing\\".Arbuthnot, May Hill (ed); The Arbuthnot Anthology of Children's Literature; Scott, Foresman, 1976, pg. 1045; The Horn Book said, We Alcotts \\"Captures the aura of their lives, permits them to speak for themselves, and reveals the humors and rigors of their situation.\\"Horn Book Magazine, Oct. 1968; In Jeanne d'Arc, \\"The familiar story is beautifully retold for young readers, with just enough historical background and a reverent simplicity.\\"Sutherland, Zena, \\"Hits and Errors\\", The Saturday Review, 6/27/1970, pg. 39. National Council of Teachers of English complimented her \\"energizing American history prose against a background of place geography and basic information\\", and goes on to say, \\"Miss Fisher knows human nature.\\"Elementary English, Volume 44, Issue 2, National Council of Teachers of English, 1967 Not everyone praised all her works so highly, however. Kirkus reviewed the award-winning Feathered Ones and Furry as a \\"collection of coy and innocuous little animal rhymes. The verses are technically conventional, with rhythm and rhyme schemes ranging from mildly pleasant to flatly predictable\\". Again, writing of In the Middle of the Night, in which a little girl celebrates her birthday by taking a special night time walk with her Father, Kirkus said, \\"The bibliotherapeutic possibilities perhaps outweigh anything that might be said about the poem as poetry\\".

As a young child, he showed little interest in sports, but he was the son of a former All-City running back from Austin's Reagan High School and a cousin of former University of Texas running back Shon Mitchell. =Accident= When David was ten, his family moved to San Antonio, Texas. At the encouragement of a new friend he began playing football at the Pop Warner level. After his junior season of varsity high school football in 2003, David was selected as a Unanimous First-Team All Area Class 5A defensive back by The San Antonio Express-News. That season would be his first and only season playing varsity football for San Antonio's James Madison High School. During the final minutes of the first round play-off game in Austin against Westlake High School, he collided face down with the crown of his helmet to the chest of Westlake receiver Coy Aune. The impact of the collision shattered David's C-4 and C-5 neck vertebrae, leaving him paralyzed from the shoulders down. Over 9,000 people were on hand to witness the devastating accident. His injury profoundly affected many who were in the stadium. One attendee was filmmaker Peter Berg, who had followed Westlake's season as part of his own research on Texas high school football, prior to filming the movie version of Friday Night Lights. Seeking a way to help Edwards, Berg eventually came up with the idea of having a benefit concert for him and other young men in similar circumstances. That concert took place on April 2004 in Austin. The concert was produced by Friday Night Lights cast member and country music star Tim McGraw. McGraw and his wife Faith Hill headlined the concert along with Friday Night Lights star and musician Billy Bob Thornton and his friend, rock legend Alice Cooper. The concert raised $28,000, to be divided evenly between the David Edwards Trust and the Gridiron Heroes Spinal Cord Injury Organization. =Post-accident life= Edwards' injury and rehabilitation also inspired Berg to create the character Jason Street (played by Scott Porter), in the TV-series Friday Night Lights, which premiered on NBC in fall 2006. The Austin Westlake community would go on to raise over $100,000 for David in a fairly short period of time, through their athletic booster program. The moneys collected were to be used to help offset insurance deductibles and pay for other necessities that are not covered by insurance and social security. Two years later, Edwards' $1 million health insurance policy through his stepfather's work had completely been exhausted, and the school district's $5 million catastrophic policy took over with one catch: that policy had a one-time $20,000 deductible. Again, the Westlake community came to David's aid and raised another $20,000 within two weeks. In 2004, KB Homes built and donated a new single-story home custom designed for Edwards' needs in the same neighborhood where his parents had purchased a new two-story home just a year before his injury. The home was built within about one month, and most of the labor was provided by Edwards' Madison teammates and friends. Following his injury, Edwards became an inspiration to many including young children in elementary schools whom he spoke to about facing life's challenges with a positive attitude. He also mentored youths who faced similar physical challenges and befriended those who faced terminal disease. Edwards also became an active participant in the Gridiron Heroes Spinal Cord Injury Foundation. He became very close friends with Chris Canales, the co-founder of the website, who like Edwards was an all-district defensive back who had suffered a spinal cord injury, in Canales' case while making a tackle playing for San Marcos Baptist Academy in 2001. The two were frequently seen together on the field at numerous high school and college football games, continuing to support the sport that brought about their disabilities. Edwards frequently joined Canales and his father Eddie Canales at fundraising events throughout the state of Texas. =Death= David Edwards died of pneumonia related complications at the age of 20 on February 27, 2008, at Northeast Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.David Edwards, paralyzed in game against Westlake, dies He was three days away from his 21st birthday.Ex-Madison Football Player David Edwards Dies Edwards accident was featured in an episode of the HBO documentary series State of Play in 2014.

Originally from England, he settled in the colony in 1863 for health reasons. Early life Jones was the third son of John Humphreys Jones, from the Shropshire region in England. He received his education from the Reverend G. Wharton, vicar of Kinver, and learned the trades of architecture and surveyor. He was employed by the architecture firm Haslam and Butler in London. In January 1863, Jones arrived in Lyttelton with his brother T. D. Jones on the Chariot of Fame. His second brother, John Humphreys, remained in Dalston, London. The main reason for emigration was to improve his health by a change of climate. Jones was for several years employed in the office of the builder Jenkins, and he worked in the office of Messrs W. Montgomery and Co after that. Jenkins, Jones and a Mr Innes started a flax mill in Kaiapoi, but the business failed. The site was later occupied by the Kaiapoi Woollen Manufacturing Company. Political career Jones held numerous offices in local government, and was later described as the foremost expert in the country on local government matters. He was a member of the Heathcote Road Board, including its chairman. In 1880, he was chosen to represent the Heathcote district on the South Waimakariri Board of Conservators, which later became the South Waimakariri River Board. For some time, he chaired the board and retired from it in December 1887, owing to his parliamentary workload. In January 1882, he was chosen as the Heathcote Road Board representative on the Drainage Board, but he resigned from that role in May of that year. In 1881, he was elected onto the Selwyn County Council as the representative for the Heathcote riding, and remained a councillor until his death. His main contributions were a principal part in organising the Halswell drainage scheme and securing the Cashmere Hills domain as a public reserve. From 1883 until his death, he was the chairman of the board that administered this domain. He was appointed in 1885 by the Selwyn County Council as their representative on the Hospital Board, and on the Charitable Aid Board, the latter of which he chaired in 1886‚Äì87. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the Hospital Board. =Member of Parliament= The death on 17 December 1886 of John Coster, who represented the Heathcote electorate in parliament, caused the February 1887 Heathcote by-election. There were several people interested in standing in the electorate, including the former Heathcote MP Henry Wynn- Williams, but with Jones and the current Mayor of Christchurch, Aaron Ayers considered as the only contenders of having a chance of success, most other candidates withdrew from the contest. On nomination day on 2 February 1887, Jones and Ayers were nominated. A third person, James Arthur Williams, nominated himself, but could not find anybody to second this motion. Thus, the by-election was a two-person contest. On election day, 8 February 1887, the majority opinion was that Ayers would win. There was great interest in the election, as evidenced by the high turnout. Jones had a considerable majority over Ayers, with 527 and 336 votes, respectively. The 191 votes majority was mirrored by Jones having won all four polling stations. At the 26 September 1887 general election, Jones and J. H. Hopkins were nominated. Hopkins was an active supporter of Jones for the by-election some seven months earlier and had proposed him at the 2 February nomination meeting, but had developed policy differences with regards to the economic recession. Jones and Hopkins received 756 and 309 votes, respectively. Hence, the majority for Jones was 447 votes, and he was elected to the 10th Parliament. Jones was a first cousin of Edward Wingfield Humphreys, who represented the Christchurch North electorate in 1889‚Äì90. Death Jones died on 8 September 1890 after several months of illness at his home in Lichfield Street, Christchurch Central City. On the day of his death, the House of Representatives adjourned their meeting for almost five hours out of respect for the deceased member. He was buried at the Barbadoes Street Cemetery on 10 September. As his death was close to the next general election, which was held in December 1890, there was no by- election for the vacant seat. The Heathcote electorate was won by William Tanner.

Formerly known as Carolina, it was given the nickname of \\"Snipetown\\" many years ago by locals, owing to the high numbers of snipes that used to inhabit the area. The hamlet is near the source of the Burrelton Burn and lies between the Sidlaw Hills and the River Tay, 2 miles (3 km) north east of Guildtown and 7 miles (11 km) north-east of Perth. Close to Wolfhill are examples of pre-historic standing stones. One of the best-known sites in folklore is \\"The Witches' Stane\\" located between Wolfhill and St Martins. According to local legend, this was the stone to which Macbeth's witches were chained, and it does indeed bear chain marks. \\"MacBeth's Castle\\" (a hill fort) can be found at the nearby village of Collace, near the Council Quarry on the Sidlaws. There are varying stories on how the village got its name, one being that the \\"Wolf of Badenoch\\" (Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan) camped there before going to Perth in the 14th century to be officially forgiven by the church for his evil ways. He is buried at Dunkeld Cathedral in a cask. It is also said that the last wolf in Scotland was killed in Wolfhill but many other villages across the country lay claim to the same story. There is no doubt that wolves inhabited the area at one time. The monks of nearby Coupar Angus Abbey, who formerly owned the land, stipulated in certain mid-16th-century lease agreements recorded in the document known today as the Rent Book of Coupar-Angus Abbey (Rogers 1880; pages 251, 262) that tenants were required to \\"... sustene and nwrice ane leche of hundis for tod and wolf..\\" - that is to say, \\"...sustain and nourish a leash of hounds for (hunting) fox and wolf..\\".

The trapezoid- shaped basalt lava outcropping, located 30 km southwest of the town of Zabol, rises to 609 meters above sea level and has a diameter ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 kilometres. It is the only natural height in the Sistan area, and is named after an Islamic pilgrimage site on the hill: the tomb and shrine of Khwaja Ali Mahdi, a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Mount Khwaja is also considered an important archaeological site. On the southern promontory of the eastern slope, the ruins of a citadel complex - known as the Ghagha-Shahr - with its remains of a fire temple date to pre-Islamic Iran. According to Zoroastrian legend, Lake Hamun is \\"the keeper of Zoroaster's seed.\\" In Zoroastrian eschatology, when the final renovation of the world is near, maidens will enter the lake and then give birth to the saoshyans, the saviours of humankind. The fire temple is on a terrace behind high walls and is protected by two forts, whose remains are respectively known as Kok-e Zal and Chehel Dokhtaran. Collectively, the ruins are called Qal'a-e Kafaran \\"Fort of Infidels\\" or Qal'a-e Sam \\"Fort of Sam,\\" the grandfather of the mythical Rostam (one of the fortresses here is named \\"Rostams castle\\"). Both names reflect pre-Islamic heritage. The walls of the temple were once extravagantly decorated with murals, some of which are now on display in museums in Tehran, Berlin, New Delhi and New York. The citadel complex was first investigated by Marc Aurel Stein in 1915‚Äì1916. The site was later excavated by Ernst Herzfeld, and was again investigated in part by Giorgio Gullini in a short expedition of 1960. Initially, Herzfeld tentatively dated the palace complex to the 1st century CE, that is, to the Arsacid period (248 BCE-224 CE). Herzfeld later revised his estimate to a later date and today the Sassanid period (224-651 CE) is usually considered to be more likely. Three bas-reliefs on the outer walls that depict riders and horses are attributed to this later period. Beyond the citadel at the top of the plateau are several other unrelated buildings, of uncertain function and probably dating to the Islamic period.

He went on to make a further ten league appearances in the 1963‚Äì64 season and scored one goal, in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Blackburn Rovers at Bloomfield Road on 30 March 1963. In 1964‚Äì65, Rowe was a regular in the defence, making 23 league appearances and scoring four goals. The following season, 1965‚Äì66, saw him make limited appearances, just thirteen overall. The same applied for 1966‚Äì67. In Stan Mortensen's first full season in the manager's hotseat, Rowe again only saw action for a quarter of the season. He did score his first goal in two season, however, in a 2‚Äì1 win at Norwich City on 20 April 1968. Season 1968‚Äì69 saw Mortensen move Rowe into a forward position for part of the season.

He studied at the Jesuit college in Albi followed by Toulouse and then attended the medical faculty in Montpellier between 1762 and 1765. In 1766, Portal moved to Paris where he became a teacher of anatomy to the dauphin.

He previously represented Switzerland (particularly at the 2010 FIFA World Cup), before switching to the newly formed Kosovo national football team, for which he was the former all-time top scorer with three goals.  Club career  When Bunjaku was eight years old, he moved with his mother and two brothers to Switzerland, where his father was already working. Bunjaku joined his first club at 13 ‚Äì unusually late for a future professional. Before starting out with FC Schlieren, he only played football in the schoolyard or on the five-a-side court. At that stage he was also very keen on basketball. Bunjaku playing for Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt Bunjaku's first step on the professional ladder was at FC Schaffhausen in the Challenge League, Switzerland's second division. The team won promotion to the Super League in 2003‚Äì04 and over the course of the next 18 months the young forward made 39 top-flight appearances. In January 2006, the 23-year-old Bunjaku left Schaffhausen for 2. Bundesliga side SC Paderborn. His first staging post in Germany was destined to last just six months however, as he failed to establish himself under then-coach Jos Luhukay. \\"At the time I didn't have the feeling he was Bundesliga material\\", Luhukay says now. As a result, Bunjaku found himself unemployed in the summer of 2006. Then however, a chance conversation turned Bunjaku's fortunes around. His wife Arieta worked in a boutique in Paderborn frequented by the wife of former Paderborn coach Pavel Dochev. They struck up a conversation and it transpired that Dotchev, now in charge of Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt, was on the lookout for a striker. No sooner said than done, and Bunjaku was on the move to third-division Erfurt. He first came to the attention of the wider footballing public when Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt took on Bayern Munich in a DFB Cup tie on 10 August 2008. Coming on as a second-half substitute in what was J√ºrgen Klinsmann's competitive debut as Bayern coach, Bunjaku put two goals past the record champions, who eventually squeezed past their lower-league opponents 4‚Äì3.  International career  On 14 November 2009, Bunjaku made his international debut for Switzerland in the 0‚Äì1 home loss to Norway in a friendly match after coming on as a substitute for Alexander Frei at half time. He was part of the Swiss squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, playing the last 13 minutes of the group match against Chile after coming on for Gelson Fernandes.

Queen of Poland Eleonore married Michael Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki, king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania, on 27 February 1670 in the Jasna G√≥ra Monastery.

Queen Eleonore was regarded as a model of goodness, softness and loyalty toward her spouse. She learned Polish, although she preferred Latin, and accompanied Michael on his official journeys around Poland. She was guided in her role as queen by her lady-in-waiting Klara Izabella Pacowa, who became her influential favorite. King Michael died on 10 November 1673.

A movement to change the spelling of the District of Timiskaming to Temiskaming (an e instead of an i) cites a typographical error by a government official, but the act of parliament that led to the name change granted this official authority to correct the spelling.

The tale recounts the unfortunate fate of a young hunter named Actaeon, who was a grandson of Cadmus, and his encounter with chaste Artemis, known to the Romans as Diana, goddess of the hunt. The latter is nude and enjoying a bath in a spring with help from her escort of nymphs when the mortal man unwittingly stumbles upon the scene. The nymphs scream in surprise and attempt to cover Diana, who, in a fit of embarrassed fury, splashes water upon Actaeon. He is transformed into a deer with a dappled hide and long antlers, robbed of his ability to speak, and thereafter promptly flees in fear. It is not long, however, before his own hounds track him down and kill him, failing to recognize their master.Ovid. Metamorphoses, translated by A.D. Melville (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986, 2003). Art The story became very popular in the Renaissance. The most common scene shown was Actaeon surprising Diana, but his transformation and his death were also sometimes shown. Titian painted the first two scenes in two of his greatest late poesies for Philip II of Spain, in Diana and Actaeon and The Death of Actaeon. The latter actually shows the transformation still in progress; like many depictions the head is shown transformed, but most of the body remains human. Less often Actaeon is fully transformed when caught by his dogs. The story was popular on Italian Renaissance maiolica. In Matthew Barney's 2019 movie Redoubt set in the Sawtooth Mountains of the U.S. state of Idaho and an accompanying traveling art exhibition originating at the Yale University Art Gallery the myth is retold by the visual artist and filmmaker via avenues of his own design.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/design/matthew-barney-review- yale-university.amp.html Diane and Actaeon's myth has also deeply inspired the French film/theatre director, writer and visual artist Jean Michel Bruy√®re and his collective LFKs, who produced a series of 600 shorts and \\"medium\\" films, an interactive 360¬∞ installation, Si poteris narrare licet (\\"if you are able to speak of it, then you may do so\\")What Is Contemporary Art?

Ballet  The origins of the Diana and Actaeon Pas de Deux, a divertissement created for a 1935 version of La Esmeralda, lie in two earlier ballet productions. The first of these was Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule, premiered in 1868 by the Imperial Russian Ballet in Saint Petersburg.Horst Koegler, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet (Oxford University Press, 1976). Based on a story told by Herodotus in his Histories,Herodotus, The Histories, translated by Robin Waterfield (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008). this four-act ballet, choreographed by Marius Petipa to music by Cesare Pugni, included a pas de trois for dancers portraying Diana, the Roman goddess of the moon, the hunt, and chastity; Endymion, a beautiful shepherd, and a Satyr. This divertissement told of a poetic encounter in which Diana (or Selene, another name for the moon goddess) looked down upon the sleeping youth, descended to earth, kissed him, and fell in love.Thomas Bulfinch, Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable, edited by Norma Lorre Goodrich (New York: Plume Books, 1995). In a production mounted in the early twentieth century, Anna Pavlova was among those who danced Diana, and Vaslav Nijinsky appeared as the Satyr.Bronislava Nijinska, Bronislava Nijinska: Early Memoirs (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1983). In 1917, George Balanchine, then Balanchivadze, also danced the role of the Satyr, with Lydia Ivanova as Diana and Nicholas Efimov as Endymion.George Balanchine Foundation, \\"Roles Performed by Balanchine\\" at Balanchine Catalogue online, http://balanchine.org. Retrieved 5 February 2015. In 1886, Petipa incorporated a new pas de deux, set to music by Riccardo Drigo, into his production of Pugni's La Esmeralda for the Maryinsky Ballet,Lincoln Kirstein, \\"La Esmeralda,\\" in Movement and Metaphor: Four Centuries of Ballet (New York: Pitman, 1970).Marius Petipa, The Diaries of Marius Petipa, translated and edited by Lynn Garafola, \\"Studies in Dance History,\\" vol. 3.1 (Spring, 1992). as the Imperial Russian Ballet had come to be called. This pas de deux was based on the Greek myth of Artemis (predecessor to the Roman Diana), in her aspect of virgin goddess of the hunt, and Actaeon, a Theban hero. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, Actaeon, out on a hunt, stumbled upon Artemis while she was bathing at a spring. Outraged and embarrassed that he had seen her naked, she punished him by destroying his power of speech and turning him into a stag, with antlers and a shaggy coat. In deer form, he was torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs, whipped into a raging fury by Artemis. In 1935, Agrippina Vaganova staged a new production of La Esmeralda for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad,Vera Krasovskaya, Agrippina Iakovlevna Vaganova (Leningrad, 1989).Kirstein, \\"La Esmeralda\\" (1970). as the company and the city were then known. She created a new, bravura pas de deux for Diana and Actaeon, joining the names of the modest Roman goddess and the hapless Greek hunter. She included a few spectacular \\"stag leaps\\" for the male dancer, but she largely abandoned the well-known story of Actaeon in creating this divertissement and made instead a rapturous dance for two lovers, set to music by Pugni. Diana is seen as the beautiful goddess of the moon and the hunt, usually wearing a wispy red chiton and carrying a small golden bow; Actaeon is portrayed as a strong, handsome, mortal youth, clad in a short chiton or loincloth. At the premiere, Diana was danced by Galina Ulanova and Actaeon by Vaktang Chabukiani.\\"Diana and Actaeon pas de deux,\\" American Ballet Theater website, http://www.abt.org/performanes. Retrieved 5 February 2015. Vaganova's popular pas de deux, which might have been better called Diana and Endymion, is still performed today as a spectacular showpiece for a ballerina and her partner.

It was founded by Aubrey de Vere I and his wife Beatrice in or before 1111. Their eldest son Geoffrey had died at Abingdon about seven or eight years earlier and was buried there. On his deathbed, Geoffrey had bequeathed to Abingdon the church and lands at Kensington, Middlesex, and his parents and brothers had confirmed that grant, as had King Henry I. Aubrey and Beatrice became very attached to Abingdon, but as they lived primarily in Essex, the aging couple found it difficult to journey there. They founded Colne Priory, the only cell of Abingdon, in order to have monks of that house close to them and as a family mausoleum. About 1112 Aubrey I retired to the priory, joined by his youngest son, William de Vere, both of whom died there shortly thereafter. Colne Priory became the principal burial place of the earls of Oxford, with all but a few buried there to 1703. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the Crown granted the priory to John de Vere (1482‚Äì1540), 15th Earl of Oxford on 22 July 1536.The National Archives, C 66/668, mm. 26-7. The surviving tombs at Colne, some with effigies, were removed from the house now existing on the site (the house is also called Colne Priory) in the 1930s to St Stephen's Chapel near Bures, Suffolk, where they are now. A late 12th- century cartulary exists. The relations between Abingdon and its priory were occasionally discordant, and in the 13th century Colne Priory became an independent priory.

Cave competes internationally for Wales and Great Britain. Early and personal life At the age of four Cave's parents (her father was a carpenter) moved to Queensland, Australia, where she went to school. Returning to England, as her mother is Welsh, she chose to represent Wales. Growing up Cave swam, ran cross country and was a surf lifeguard. Cave met German triathlete Torsten Abel in 1999 in Portugal. They married in summer 2010, and moved to Tucson, Arizona. The couple are currently separated. In February 2013, Cave was diagnosed with skin cancer. Career Cave entered her first triathlon at the encouragement of her sister, who already participated in them.Leanda Cave: GB Elite Ironman triathlete In 2001 Cave became European Under-23 champion. A year later she would internationally break through at the senior level as she won the silver medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. She won another silver medal at the European Championships, then had greater success when she took the gold and the World title in Canc√∫n, Mexico in November 2002.Cave clinches world title In 2002, she was nominated for the Welsh Sports Personality of the Year Award.Welsh Sports Personality of the Year 2002 Profiles - Leanda Cave Cave struggled with injury in 2003 and was unable to defend her world title,Cave out of title defence although did take part in the BBC series Superstars.Superstars Profiles - Leanda Cave Cave won her second world title in 2007 at the ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships in Lorient, France. On 28 March 2008, at the Ford Ironman 70.3 California triathlon, Cave came in third place behind Erika Csomor and Mirinda Carfrae. At the 2010 Ironman World Championship 70.3, she took second place.

On 13 October 2012, at the Ironman World Championship, Cave came in first place. About 3 miles from the finish, Cave overtook Switzerland's Caroline Steffen who had held the lead in the run from the start and then went on to win the race. By winning both the 70.3 world championship and the Ironman World Championship in the same year, Cave became the first woman to ever achieve the 'double'. Australia's Craig Alexander accomplished this feat on the men's side in 2011. Cave struggled with injury in 2013 and though she made the start line in both events, she finished 12th in both the 70.3 and Ironman World Championships. In 2014, Cave started the year focusing on short course triathlons in a bid to make the Team Wales Commonwealth Games Squad, which despite a series of good results in qualifying competitions, including a win at Valparaiso ITU World Cup on 30 March 2014, ended with her non-selection for the games. Cave won Ironman Sweden 2014, finishing with the fastest times in all three disciplines.

His highest rank was maegashira 9. Career K≈çb≈ç made his professional debut in March 1989 at the age of 15. He worked his way quickly through the lowest three divisions, making his makushita debut shortly after his 18th birthday, less than three years into his career. However, he was unable to advance further for several years, reaching sekitori status only in January 1999 upon promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division, after nearly ten years of toiling in the lower divisions. He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in November 2001 but only lasted two tournaments before being demoted. He returned on two other occasions but he largely remained a veteran of the j≈´ry≈ç division, in which he spent 44 tournaments. For a long period he was the highest ranking wrestler in Miyagino stable, before the emergence of Hakuho, now a yokozuna. In July 2007, he fell to the unsalaried makushita division for the first time since September 2000, and he announced his retirement in December of that year. Retirement from sumo K≈çb≈ç remained with the Japan Sumo Association as an elder under the name Ajigawa-oyakata, and initially worked as a coach at his old stable. In May 2008, he had his danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, at the Ryogoku Kokugikan. In February 2010 he admitted that, against the wishes of the Tatsunami ichimon, he voted for independent candidate Takanohana instead of the approved candidate ≈åshima in the elections to the Sumo Association's board. He offered his resignation, but was persuaded to stay. Following the controversy he moved to the Takanohana stable where he coached under the name Nishiiwa-oyakata, which was owned by the active wrestler Wakanosato. In July 2015, with Wakanosato likely to retire, he switched to the Otowayama name formerly owned by the late Takanonami.

Transistor array ULN2803APG (Toshiba) ‚Äì 8 Darlington pairs. Transistor arrays consist of two or more transistors on a common substrate. Unlike more highly integrated circuits, the transistors can be used individually like discrete transistors. That is, the transistors in the array are not connected to each other to implement a specific function. Transistor arrays can consist of bipolar junction transistors or field-effect transistors. There are three main motivations for combining several transistors on one chip and in one package: * to save circuit board space and to reduce the board production cost (only one component needs to be populated instead of several) * to ensure closely matching parameters between the transistors (which is almost guaranteed when the transistors on one chip are manufactured simultaneously and subject to identical manufacturing process variations) * to ensure a closely matching thermal drift of parameters between the transistors (which is achieved by having the transistors in extremely close proximity) The matching parameters and thermal drift are crucial for various analogue circuits such as differential amplifiers, current mirrors, and log amplifiers. The reduction in circuit board area is particularly significant for digital circuits where several switching transistors are combined in one package. Often the transistors here are Darlington pairs with a common emitter and flyback diodes, e.g. ULN2003A. While this stretches the above definition of a transistor array somewhat, the term is still commonly applied. A peculiarity of transistor arrays is that the substrate is often available as a separate pin (labelled substrate, bulk, or ground). Care is required when connecting the substrate in order to maintain isolation between the transistors in the array as p‚Äìn junction isolation is usually used. For instance, for an array of NPN transistors, the substrate must be connected to the most negative voltage in the circuit.

Early career Egon Loy spent the first years of his senior career in Schwabach near Nuremberg. From local side TSV 04 Schwabach he was promoted to the first Bavarian amateur league. Until 1954 he played with his home club in the highest amateur tier of Bavaria. Loy was the backing of the Bavarian association selection and won the L√§nderpokal of the amateurs three times from 1952 until 1954. Erich B√§umler, Ludwig Hinterstocker and Johann Zeitler were the strikers, scoring many goals. On 30 May 1954 Loy played for the Germany national amateur football team in Longwy against France. It was the only amateur international match in 1954, ending 0‚Äì0. In the 1954‚Äì55 season he moved to Eintracht Frankfurt. His team mate from the Bavaria selection, Erich B√§umler, also signed with the Hessian club.  Eintracht Frankfurt, 1954 until 1967  His debut in the Oberliga S√ºd led the former amateur on 22 August 1954 to the local Mainderby at Bieberer Berg in Offenbach. Egon Loy played well at the 1‚Äì0 away win and could secure a regular spot. He played 28 times for Eintracht and finished the season as fourth. The Frank had a heavy knee injury and could only play one match in his second Eintracht season in 1955‚Äì56 and even in the 1956‚Äì57 campaign he had to fight for his comeback. The next season, he recovered. Egon Loy absolved all 30 Oberliga fixtures and finished third. On 17 November 1957 he got a call up for the South German selection against South West Germany. For the 1958‚Äì59 season former Offenbach manager Paul O√üwald moved to Frankfurt. The squad from Riederwald won the South German championship and lost not a point in the final round, advancing to the German championship final. On 28 June 1959, Loy and his team mates won the German championship 5‚Äì3 after overtime against Kickers Offenbach in Berlin. In 1959‚Äì60, Frankfurt played in the European Cup competition. The semi final matches against Scottish side Rangers on 13 April and 5 May 1960 were especially impressive. After a sensational 6‚Äì1 win at home, Eintracht then won 6‚Äì3 at Ibrox Park in Glasgow. The final match on 18 May at Hampden Park against the title holder Real Madrid was a football festival, despite the 3‚Äì7 loss. Alfredo Di Stefano und Ferenc Pusk√°s showed why they were considered as the biggest stars of the competition. In the last three season of the Oberliga S√ºd from 1960‚Äì61 until 1962‚Äì63, Loy appeared in all 90 fixtures. In the next two campaigns of the new founded Bundesliga, 1963‚Äì64 and 1964‚Äì65, the Schwabach native was still an unchallenged regular between the Eintracht pipes. He also played in Stuttgart the DFB cup final on 13 June 1964 against TSV 1860 M√ºnchen. The Lions won 2‚Äì0 against Frankfurt. From 1965‚Äì66 on the former amateur national goal keeper Peter Kunter who came from Eintracht Wetzlar became number one of the Eagles. Loy played his last Bundesliga match on 8 October 1966 against MSV Duisburg. In total, Egon Loy played 69 Bundesliga matches between 1963 and 1966.

Synopsis  One evening, in the midst of torrential rains, a professor (Shreeram Lagoo) goes out for a walk and fails to return. As the evening stretches into days and the days into weeks with no sign of him, his family struggles to regain their footing and to understand what might have caused him to leave. Slowly they return to their daily activities. The professor's son Amit \\"Amu\\"(Arjun Chakraborty) establishes his fledgling business; his younger daughter Seema (Roopa Ganguly) resumes her studies at college; and his elder daughter, Neeta (Shabana Azmi), the backbone of the family, returns to her office job. Behind the facade of normalcy, though, the family is deeply wounded. Amit enjoys success in his business but is bitter and dour. Seema passes with 'First Division' in College. Neeta has a very patient and supportive boyfriend Alok (Anjan Dutt), but the relationship is stuck in a holding pattern. And their mother (Uttara Baokar) suffers debilitating depression.

The movie was released straight to DVD on November 29, 2005 by Lions Gate Entertainment and Baseline StudioSystems. Directors Gardner and Cunningham intended the film to be a \\"rebirth\\" of the film franchise, with the film not requiring viewers to have seen the prior two films. Synopsis The movie takes place after the events in the first film and follows Hadley (Weston Blakesley), a repairman that purchases the possessed machine from the first movie and becomes obsessed with the machine. Hadley awakens the machine with his blood and after being \\"eaten\\" by it, is forced to feed it new blood to stop his corpse from rotting. One day, a young woman named Jamie comes home, having been fired from her job as an executive after getting into a fight with her boss. Her boyfriend, Sean, having heard about her workplace incident, breaks up with her and moves out of the house. While showering, Jamie starts to cry, until her shower is unexpectedly shut off, making call for Hadley to repair her water heater. With her back turned, Hadley knocks unconscious and takes her back to his home, which now fortified with a security system and deadly booby traps. Rick and Mike, a father/son burglary duo, try to break into Hadley's home, after hearing about his life insurance policy that he has. Rick breaks in and communicates withe Mike on a radio that he can't get out. After hearing Jamie's cries for help, he tries to help her, but Hadley comes home and beats Rick to death with a ballpean hammer, and feeds him to his machine. Mike walks into the house while Hadley is away, and wants to help Jamie get out of the house, but just wants the money and leave. Rick thinks that his dad left him, while conversing with Jamie about his life after his mother died, leaving his father widowed, not knowing about past criminal history. Hadley, now knowing Rick is inside the house tries to kill him, but accidentally disables his security system, unlocking the room Jamie was in, freeing her, while Rick starts to fight Hadley, whom kills him by shoving him head first into a woodchipper. Jamie and Hadley fight, resulting in both of them falling into the woodchipper. A week later, Hadley, having survived, rings the doorbell of another potential victim.

The ordeal is further explained in the Talmud, in the seventh tractate of Nashim. A sotah ( Spelled \\"◊©◊ï◊ò◊î\\" in Maimonides' manuscript (http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/html/heb5703_h.htm ). This spelling recurs in Rabbi Yosef Qafeh's editions of Maimonides' works. / ◊°◊ï◊ò◊î) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible. The term \\"sotah\\" itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is Mishnaic Hebrew based on the verse \\"if she has strayed\\" (verb: ◊©◊ò◊î satah) in Numbers 5:12.The Holy Scriptures: Proverbs, with commentary - Julius Hillel Greenstone, Jewish Publication Society of America - 1950 - Page 42 \\"10.6; 21.10; Num. 5.18). turn] The word is used in connection with the woman suspected of infidelity (Num. 5), whence the technical term sotah is derived, the name given to the treatise of the Mishnah and the Talmud dealing with this subject.\\" Hebrew Bible The account of the ordeal of bitter water given in the Book of Numbers is as follows:  Jewish tradition  =Mishnah and Talmud= According to the Mishnah, it was the practice for the woman to first be brought to the Sanhedrin, before being subjected to the ordeal. Repeated attempts would be made to persuade the woman to confess, including multiple suggestions to her of possible mitigating factors; if she confessed, the ordeal was not required. The regulations require that the ordeal take place when the woman is brought to an Israelite priest, or when she is brought before God. The Mishnah reports that, in the time of the Second Temple, she was taken to the East Gate of the Temple, in front of the Nikanor gate. The woman is required by the biblical passage to have loosened hair during the ritual; this is often taken to be a symbol of the woman's supposed shame, but according to Josephus, it was merely the standard behaviour for anyone accused of any crime, when they appeared before the Sanhedrin.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 14:49 The Mishnah also states that the garment she was wearing was ripped to expose her heart. A rope was tied above her breasts so that her clothes did not completely fall off. The Mishnah, however, argues that the clothing on the woman's upper body was also stripped away, leaving her bare-breasted.Mishnah, Sotah, 1:5 =Trial= The ordeal This trial consisted of the wife having to drink a specific potion administered by the priest. The text does not specify the amount of time needed for the potion to take effect; 19th century scholars suspected it was probably intended to have a fairly immediate effect. The Mishnah mentions there could also be a suspension of the ordeal for one, two or three years, if she has an acquittal.Mishnah, Sotah, 3:4 Maimonides records the traditional Rabbinical view: \\"Her belly swells first and then her thigh ruptures and she dies\\". Others maintain that since the word \\"thigh\\" is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for various reproductive organs, in this case it may mean the uterus, the placenta or an embryo, and the woman would survive. Nachmanides points out that of all the 613 commandments, it is only the sotah law that requires God's specific co-operation to make it work. The bitter waters can only be effective miraculously. The text specifies that the potion should be made from water and dust; in the masoretic text, the water used for the potion must be holy water, and the Targum interprets it as water from the Molten Sea, but the Septuagint instead requires running water. The passage argues that the curse was washed into the water; it is thought that this idea derives from a belief that the words of a curse exist in their own right. Others argue that the curse is a euphemism for a miscarriage or infertility. The potion also had to be mixed in an earthenware vessel; this may have been because the potion was regarded as a taboo which could be spread by contact, and therefore also made the vessel taboo, necessitating its subsequent destruction (as do the biblical rules concerning taboo animals, for any earthenware vessels into which such animals fall). However, the TalmudSotah 9a and Rashi explain that this vessel is chosen to contrast the woman's predicament with her behavior. She gave the adulterer to drink choice wine in valuable goblets; therefore, let her drink bitter water in a worthless clay vessel. Maimonides further writes: \\"When she dies, the adulterer because of whom she was compelled to drink will also die, wherever he is located. The same phenomena, the swelling of the belly and the rupture of the thigh, will also occur to him. All the above applies provided her husband never engaged in forbidden sexual relations in his life. If, however, her husband ever engaged in forbidden relations, the [bitter] waters do not check [the fidelity of] his wife.\\" The offering The husband was required to make a sacrifice to God, as part of the ritual, probably due to a general principle that no one should seek answers from God without giving something in return. This offering is required to be placed in the wife's hands, and is literally described as her offering for her; scholars think that it is the man's offering, in relation to the ordeal of his wife, and that her holding of it is merely symbolic of this. The offering specified is one tenth of an ephah of barley meal, unaccompanied by oil or frankincense; this is the cheaper type of flour, unlike the flour specified for all other biblical sacrifices. The specification is now thought to be a rare survival of an earlier period, in which there was no restriction on the types of flour which could be used for sacrifices, although the Mishnah argues that it was a reference to the bestial nature of adultery, coarse flour being the food of beasts.Mishnah, Sotah, 2:1 = False accusations = If the woman was unharmed by the bitter water, the rules regard her as innocent of the accusation. The account in the Book of Numbers states that the man shall be free from blame (5:26). This is not to be confused with the Deuteronomic Code, which pertains to when a man accuses his wife of pre-marital sex; when accusation is disproven, the husband is to be fined, and is no longer to have the right of divorcing the wife () There is more reason to fine and whip the man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex than the husband of the sotah woman. The man who accuses his wife of pre-marital sex has no proof about his wife when he accuses her, whereas by a sotah woman, the husband initially warned her not to seclude herself with a particular man, which she thereafter did. Therefore, whether she is innocent of the accusation of adultery or not, she still has caused reasonable suspicion in the eyes of her husband. The rabbinical interpretation of is that when a woman accused of adultery who was innocent drinks the bitter water, even if she was previously unable to conceive, she will now conceive and give birth to a male.Talmud, Sotah 26a; =Cessation of the ordeal= According to Mishnah, Sotah, 9:9 the practice was abolished some time during the first century CE under the leadership of Yohanan ben Zakkai. But even if it had not been abolished, the rite would have sunk into abeyance with the fall of the Temple (in approximately the year 70 CE), because, according to the Law, the ceremony could not be performed elsewhere. Explanations in rabbinical literature vary concerning cessation of the practice. Yohanan Ben Zakkai stated: Rabbi Hanina of Sura said in Talmud Sotah: Christian references Although the actual ordeal was not practiced in Christianity it was referenced by Christian writers through the ages in relation to both the subject of adultery, and also the wider practice of trial by ordeal. Additionally, some early Christian legends, such as the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, embroider the life of Mary, mother of Jesus with accounts including Mary (and even JosephThe Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, chapter 12: \\"And again Joseph was summoned to the altar, and the water of drinking of the Lord was given him to drink. And when any one that had lied drank this water, and walked seven times round the altar, God used to show some sign in his face. When, therefore, Joseph had drunk in safety, and had walked round the altar seven times, no sign of sin appeared in him. Then all the priests, and the officers, and the people justified him, saying: Blessed art thou, seeing that no charge has been found good against thee. [...] Then Mary said, stedfastly and without trembling: O Lord God, King over all, who knowest all secrets, if there be any pollution in me, or any sin, or any evil desires, or unchastity, expose me in the sight of all the people, and make me an example of punishment to all. Thus saying, she went up to the altar of the Lord boldly, and drank the water of drinking, and walked round the altar seven times, and no spot was found in her.\\" (Wikisource)) undergoing a version of the ordeal.Joseph B. Tyson, The New Testament and Early Christianity (1984), page 199: \\"They each highlight a certain portion or aspect of Jesus' history, such as his family, his childhood, his resurrection, or his teachings. [...] But Mary became pregnant, and Joseph was afraid that his neglect had allowed an adulterer to seduce her. So the priests gave both of them a trial by bitter water, a trial they survived.\\" Abortion interpretation Several commentaries on the Bible maintain that the ordeal is to be applied in the case of a woman who has become pregnant, allegedly by her lover.Peake's commentary on the Bible (1962 edition), Numbers 5. One reading is that the ordeal results in a prolapsed uterus if she is guilty.Tikva Frymer-Kensky, in \\"Women in the Hebrew Bible\\", ed. Bach (1999, Routledge, New York and London, pages 463-474) Some interpretations of the ordeal describe the bitter potion as an abortifacient, which induces a purposeful abortion or miscarriage if the woman is pregnant with a child which her husband alleges is another man‚Äôs. If the fetus aborts as a result of the ordeal, this presumably confirms her guilt of adultery, otherwise her innocence is presumed if the fetus does not abort.Grushcow 2006, pp. 275‚Äì276  Secular analysis  The text appears to suggest first that the offering should occur before the ordeal, () and then that it should occur after it. () Due to the awkwardness of the idea that the wife has to drink the potion twice, secular textual scholars argue that either the first drinking must be a later addition to the text, or that the whole account of the ordeal must be spliced together from two earlier descriptions. Noting that there are two descriptions of the location for the ritual (in the presence of a priest, and before Yahweh,) and two occasions on which the punishment for the woman is mentioned, and the division into two earlier documents, first suggested by Bernhard StadeBernhard Stade, Zeitschrift f√ºr die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft (commonly known, among theologians, as ZATW), (1895), 15:166-178 is typically as follows: *one account is the ordeal and sacrifice before God, in which the possible miscarriage/abortion results from drinking the potionJoseph Estlin Carpenter, and George Harford-battersby (and the Society of Historical Theology, Oxford), The Hexateuch (1900, republished 2003), volume 2, pages 191-192 *the other is merely a condemnation by a priest, in which the women stands with hair loosened, her guilt is assumed, and divine intervention (due to the priest's involvement) will cause a miscarriage/abortion as punishment. Other secular Biblical scholars think that the ordeal is itself a fusion of two earlier rituals (pre-dating the original priestly text), one using water, and the other dust. The use of dust might be connected to necromancy. In other historic semitic cultures there are many instances in which holy water was regarded as taboo, and therefore that contact with it, or its consumption, was dangerous.William Robertson Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (2nd edition - 1894), 181 Modern applications According to scholars such as Helena Zlotnick, after the ordeal of bitter water was no longer practiced it remained a reference point in the search for replacements for the test of adultery.Helena Zlotnick, Dinah's Daughters: Gender and Judaism from the Hebrew Bible to ... 2002 Page 111. \\"The question that has never been asked by modern interpreters of the history of the ordeal of the bitter water is what replaced the ordeal after its abolition 41 In other words, what legal procedures were available to investigate and prosecute ...One underlying quest of this chapter is a search for the alternative that replaced the pre-70 procedures of detecting adulteresses, assuming that husbands did continue to suspect their wives of adultery and that sexual loyalty ..\\"  Similar rituals  Trials by ordeal are found in other societies of the ancient Near East such as in the Laws of Hammurabi (¬ß132).The New Oxford Annotated Bible Michael David Coogan, Marc Zvi Brettler, Carol Ann Newsom - 2007 Page 193. \\"A man who questions his wife's fidelity brings her to the sanctuary for an ordeal in which she drinks a mixture of water, dust, and ink to determine if she is culpable (cf. ... Ordeals to determine culpability are found in other societies of the ancient Near East (e.g., Hammurabi's Laws ¬ß132). ... aside to uncleanness while under your husband's authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse ...\\" Historic Muslim Arabic culture similarly had an adultery ordeal, although in scientific terms, compared to the Israelite ritual it relied more on nausea, than on directly poisoning the woman. In this Arabic ritual, the woman simply took oaths at Mecca attesting to her innocence, and asking the divinity to cause her to have a miscarriage/abortion, should she be lying;Kitab al-Aghani, 1:156:3+ but, on the way to Mecca, she would be forced to travel on a camel, between two bags of dung. Ordeals involving the risk of harm, including potential injury resulting from the drinking of certain potions, were common in antiquity; in parts of Europe, their judicial use even lasted until the late Middle Ages. Such ordeals were once believed to result in a direct decision by a deity, about the guilt or innocence of the party/parties undertaking the ordeal; typically divine intervention was believed to prevent the innocent being harmed, or to ensure that the guilty were.

CPA declined as a spoken language because of persecution and gradual Arabization following the early Islamic conquests. From the tenth century onwards it was mainly a liturgical language in the Melkite churches and the Melkite community mainly spoke Arabic. Even as a written language, it went extinct around the fourteenth century and was only identified or rediscovered as a distinct variety of Aramaic in the nineteenth century.Theodor N√∂ldeke, \\"√úber den christlich-pal√§stinischen Dialect\\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft 22 (1868), pp. 443‚Äì527. No source gives it a name as a distinct dialect or language and all such names are modern scholarly inventions. Names like \\"Palestinian Syriac\\" and \\"Syropalestinian\\" reflect the fact that Palestinian Aramaic speakers often referred to their language as Syriac and made use of an alphabet based on the northern Syriac  æEs·π≠rangƒìlƒÅ script. The terms \\"Christian Palestinian Aramaic\\" and \\"Melkite Aramaic\\" emphasise the confessional identity of the speakers and the distinctness from any Syriac variety of Aramaic. The term \\"Jerusalem Syriac\\" emphasises the location where the majority of inscriptions have been found, although the term syrica Hierosolymitana was introduced by J. D. Michaelis based on the appearance of the Arabic name of Jerusalem in the colophon of a Gospel lectionary of 1030 AD.J. D. Michaelis and J. D. G. Adler, Novi Testamenti versiones syricae Simplex, Philoxeniana et Hierosolymitana (Copenhagen, 1798), p. 140. It was also used in the first edition by Miniscalchi Erizzo. F. Miniscalchi Erizzo, Evangeliarum Hierosolymitanum (Verona, 1861); F. Rosenthal, Die aramaistische Forschung seit Th. N√∂ldeke‚Äôs Ver√∂ffentlichungen (Leiden, 1938), pp. 144‚Äì146. CPA can be distinguished from JPA and SA by the lack of direct influence from Hebrew and new Hebrew loanwords, its Hebrew loanwords being retained from an earlier symbiosis of Hebrew and Aramaic..Christa M√ºller-Kessler, Grammatik des Christlich- Pal√§stinisch-Aram√§ischen. Teil 1: Schriftlehre, Lautlehre, Morphologie (Texte und Studien zur Orientalistik 6; Hildesheim, 1991), p. 8. It is also distinguished by the presence of Greek syntax (by partial retention in translation). Also, unlike JPA and SA, only primary texts survive for CPA (in palimpsests). Most of the early transmitted texts (5th‚Äì7th centuries) are of biblical nature, often in the form of fragmentary lectionaries, but some are also theological, e.g. the catecheses by Cyril of Jerusalem, or hagiographic. There was no transmission of manuscripts after the language itself went out use as liturgical language. In comparison with its counterparts, therefore, the CPA corpus represents an older, more intact example of Western Aramaic from when the dialects were still living, spoken languages.

It consists of a single species, Elingamita johnsonii, a tree or shrub endemic to the Three Kings Islands approximately 55 km north of the North Island of New Zealand. The entire world natural population of the tree is confined to a small rocky island and two nearby islets, and thus is vulnerable to destruction by fire or other unforeseen events. Elingamita johnsonii grows as a shrub or small tree in pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa) forest and coastal scrub on West island. It also occurs on two rocky islets of the Princes Group; on one of these islets, Hinemoa Rock, it grows as an emergent canopy tree in exposed places. The relationship of Elingamita to other genera of the Primulaceae (formerly Myrsinaceae) remains to be properly established. Discovered in 1950, Elingamita johnsonii takes its name from the steamer Elingamite, which was wrecked on West Island in 1902. The natural range is currently free of rodents, but the fruit is known to be very palatable to rats. Ohau/West Island, From the West Description Elingamita johnsonii is a stoutly branched tree up to 8 m tall, but usually much less than that. The bark is grey and smooth. The dark green leaves, 10 to 18 cm long and 4 to 9 cm wide, are smooth with a satin-like gloss. The leaf stems are short, about 1 cm long. The tiny, pale yellow to pink flowers appear in terminal panicles between February and May, and sometimes also between August and November. Male and female flowers generally occur on separate trees. The attractive grape-like bunches of red fruit take a year or more to ripen. Each fruit is a globe- shaped drupe up to 20 mm in diameter which encloses a single seed. While the foliage could be mistaken for that of a Karaka tree (Corynocarpus laevigatus), the petiole or leaf stalk is much shorter and the bunches of red, fleshy fruit are very distinctive and may be seen on the tree at any time of the year. The fruits are edible, the white flesh tasting like a salty apple. Elingamita877.jpgElingamita johnsonii has large, glossy, dark-green leaves. Elingamita2757.jpgThe distinctive red fleshy fruits take a year to ripen. Propagation The plant is sometimes available for sale by specialist nurseries. Propagation is easy from seed although it may take a year to germinate. Seedlings are vigorous and thrive in semi-shade and prefer a fertile, free draining soil. Once they are established, plants do well in full sun. Cuttings are slow to strike. Male and female plants are required for the production of fruit to ensure that fruit are produced. In gardens, Elingamita johnsonii makes an excellent specimen tree for frost-free areas. It is highly sensitive to cold and intolerant of frost.

Parnasianism and Symbolism The influence of these two movements, which were developed in France since the middle of the 19th century, was very important to the appearance of the Modernism in Spain. * The Parnasianism, named after its first appearance in the magazine \\"Le Parnasse Contemporain\\" (1866‚Äì1876), is a literary style that postulates art for art's sake, far from the important and sentimental ambitions that the Romanticism defended. Those in favor tried to create \\"beautiful objects\\", approaching exotic subjects and ornamenting them with a musical language, but which are cold. The father of this school was Leconte de Lisle. * The Symbolism, however, has a transcendental ambition. The main figure of the movement is Charles Baudelaire. For the author of The flowers of evil, all the universe, spiritual, and terrestrial, forms a harmonious, united set to each other by invisible correspondences, and the personality of the poet is the one in charge of revealing them. This way, for example, a sun hiding could be seen by the writer as a decay symbol, as well as the sunrise would symbolize the Renaissance. This assumption suggests comparisons to the poet, but fundamentally metaphors. Literary Modernism in Spain: context In Literature, the precursor of the Modernism in Spain was Realism. =The disaster of the 98= The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, known in Spain as the Disaster of the 98 or War of Cuba, arose between Spain and the United States in 1898, during the regency of Mar√≠a Cristina, widow of the king Alfonso XII. For Spain it meant the loss of the overseas colonies and the end of the formerly powerful Spanish empire. =The Regenerationism= The intellectual movement that thinks objectively and scientifically about the causes of the decadence of Spain as a nation between the 19th and the 20th century is called Regenerationism. It expresses a pessimist judgement about Spain. The regenerationist intellectuals divulgated their studies in journals with a big diffusion, so the movement expanded. =The Free Institution of Education= Among the organisms of great importance at this time, it is possible to emphasize the Free Institution of Education, founded in Madrid in 1876 by the university professor and thinker Francisco Giner de los R√≠os. With philosophical ideas of German origin, he undertook a hard work of cultural modernization of Spain, in education and investigation. His pro-European character was very influential during the 20th century, particularly during the Second Republic, that welcomed his reformist ideals willingly. In 1939 the Institution disappeared, strongly repressed by the winners of the Civil War. Whatsoever, a decidedly modern thought was spread mainly between the bourgeoisie, class which will display the most important authors of the 20th century. Characteristics Modernism, studied as a literary or as an artistic-literary movement, appeared in the Hispanic world in the final decades of the 19th century and the first ones of the 20th century. It is seen today as a phenomenon with much more vast projections in space and time. A period of renovation in America and Europe was opened, which started from a common will of rejection towards the dogmas and principles of the society. The Modernist period or time begins and closes in dates that could be fixed towards 1880 and 1945, although precursory signs occurred before the first and they continued being observed after the last. In the politics, the forms of the modernist disobedience are reflected in a sentimental rather than intellectual inclination, towards the liberating creeds, socialism and anarchism. In their youth, people like Miguel de Unamuno and Leopoldo Lugones were attracted to socialism, whereas the anarchist doctrine seemed at first to attract P√≠o Baroja and Manuel Gonz√°lez Prada. The aversion to the society that surrounded them (and not only, although of course also, the governments) urged them to look for inhabitable worlds, often invented. The indigenism and the exotism are the two slopes of the protest against the predominant meanness. The escapism and the denunciation of the bourgeois society are complementary aspects of an ambivalent attitude. The plastic writers and artists agreed in the negation, and even an officially conservative man like Antonio Gaud√≠ projected in unusual architectures his escapist deliriums (arabicism of the Vicens House, in Barcelona, or purified gothicism of the Episcopal Palace of Astorga). Indigenism and exotism were not negative attitudes: they implied the affirmation of the inhabitable world; even more, of myths in which close truths of universal validity were declared. The Modernist authors were simultaneously positivists, by hostility to the established conventions, and antipositivists, by reaction against a system in which the spiritual tendencies did not have place. Trying to affiliate them with a philosophy is so impossible and absurd as trying to affiliate them with a party. From Plato and Pythagoras, mainly from this last one, or the doctrines that are protected under their name, the rhythmical conception of the universe and the life arrived to the Modernists, and it became the axis of their poetic creation. The Pythagorism of the Modernists comprises an inclination to the esoteric doctrines, shown in their interest for the hidden things and in a desire or restlessness for communicating with the afterlife, expressed already in 1895 by one of its eminent precursors: G√©rard de Nerval. The so-called declining Literature familiarized them with the occultism, and Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Leopoldo Lugones, Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, Horacio Quiroga, P√≠o Baroja, among others, wrote narrations in which the action of the strange forces is described. Valle-Incl√°n wrote up in La l√°mpara maravillosa (The wonderful lamp) a treaty of esoteric aesthetic. These restlessness logically derived to interest in spiritism. Even if nonbelieving in it, some Modernist authors really interrogated themselves about the part that could be right in those doctrines, and got initiated in their mysteries. In diverse forms these mysteries infiltrated in their works. Also the mysticism of the Modernists is interesting, orthodox or heterodox, but rarely free of eroticism, associated to the erotic impulse of giving oneself to the other, to surrender. The end point of the eroticism and the mysticism is the ecstasy. The eroticism approaches other times the violence and the blood, like with Valle-Incl√°n and Rodr√≠guez Larreta; The glory of Don Ramiro is perhaps the most extreme culmination of such associations, that in poetry were registered in unforgettable verses of Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Other poets (such as Pal√©s Matos and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez) would later raise the erotic to the point of the metaphysic. The Modernists were parnasianists, that is, in favor of the impeccable form, of the beauty called to last by the perfection whereupon it was expressed; and symbolists, that revealed the unknown by the well-known, the indescribable in figures adapted to express it. The Modernism is associated to the parnasianism with sculpture; to the symbolism with music. It does not have to be understood that between the one and other there is an unsalvable border; on the contrary, if in some modernist writers, like Jos√© Santos Chocano and Guillermo Valencia, the cult to the form predominates, in others, like Leopoldo Lugones and Antonio Machado, a preference for the intimism can be seen. And still it must be remembered that the symbolism of which it is spoken is not only consequence of the French symbolism of the Eighties; even if coming from there in the initial impulse, and although the vocabulary and the subject matter of the Modernists was impregnated by those of the French symbolists, the Spanish Modernists did not take much time in assimilating also the symbolism of the poets of English language, and still the one of San Juan the de la Cruz as well. It cannot surprise that in the general current of Modernism diverse tendencies come together, some times complementary, some times contradictory, because thus it has to be, fundamentally, any historical period, be the Renaissance, the Romanticism, or the Modernism. And those diversities and antagonisms occur inside men, and not only between men. Divided, in struggle with the others and with themselves, denying with the reason what the feeling postulates, the top figures of the Modernism, who better represented it (Rub√©n Dar√≠o or Miguel de Unamuno) lived in anguish, if not in desperation. These two feelings, much more than the swans and the princesses, mere occasional ornamientation, constitute the most arduous legacy of the Modernists to their heirs and successors. Some authors =Miguel de Unamuno= Miguel de Unamuno (1864‚Äì1936) was an essayist, novelist, poet, playwright and philosopher from Spain. In his works he cultivated a great variety of literary genres. =Rub√©n Dar√≠o= F√©lix Rub√©n Garc√≠a Sarmiento (1867‚Äì1916) was a Nicaraguan poet who wrote under the pseudonym of Rub√©n Dar√≠o. His poetry brought vigor to the stale, monotonous Spanish-language poetry of the time.

Riffians (in Tarifit Irifiyen), by others also known as Riyafa or Rwafa, are a Moroccan Berber-speaking people of Northwestern Africa, who derive their name from the Riff region in the northern edge of Morocco. Being a part to Gibraltar Arc and living close to the Iberian peninsula, communities of Riffians are found both in northeastern Morocco and southern Spain, as well as elsewhere in Western Europe and North Africa. Their native settlements were Arabized and Islamized in and after the 7th-century, during the early expansion of Islam. They are overwhelmingly maraboutic Sunni Muslims, but retain their pre-Islamic traditions such as high status for Riffian women. According to Irina Casado i Aijon, Riffians have traditionally organized themselves under \\"patrilineality and patrilocality principles\\". The oldest man in the household commands authority and responsibility for decisions, while women jointly care for the young and sick without any discrimination. Like other Berbers, temporary migration is an accepted tradition. The Riffians have been a significant source of Morocco emigrants into some European countries such as the Netherlands. Riffians speak the Tamazight group of Berber languages, specifically Tarifit or Zenatiya. The languages spoken depend on the region, with many Riffians who speak a Berber language also speaking Arabic or Spanish. Nineteen groups or social units of Riffians are known: 5 in the west along the Mediterranean coast which speak Arabic, 7 in the centre of which one speaks mainly Arabic and rest Riff language, 5 in the east and 2 in the southeastern desert area also speak the Riff-Berber language.The Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Rif people, Encyclopaedia Britannica They have inhabited an impoverished and an eroded, deforested, poorly irrigated region. Poverty rate and infant mortality rates among Riffians has been high, according to a study published in 1980 by Terri Joseph. The Riffians have lived a largely settled, agricultural lifestyle, using hand tools, oxen and cattle to plow the steeply terraced land in their valleys. Horticultural produce along with sheep and goat meat, cheese, and milk provide the traditional sustenance. Some practice sardine-seining along the Mediterranean coast. Riff War. Riffians have experienced numerous wars over their history. Some of their cultural traditions reflects and remembers this history, such as the singing and dancing of Ayara Liyara, Ayara Labuya, which literally means \\"Oh Lady oh Lady, oh Lady Buya\\" and is accompanied by izran (couplets) and addjun (tambourine tapping). This tradition, states Hsain Ilahiane, is linked to the 11th-century destruction and deaths of the Riffian fathers during the raid by the Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashfin. In more modern times, the Riff War caused numerous deaths of Riffian people and of Spanish as well as French soldiers. The Riff War witnessed the use of chemical weapons in the 1920s by the Spanish army. In 1958, some Riffian communities launched a modern nationalist movement. In the decades that followed, the Riff region has witnessed Riffian demonstrations and demands for recognition of Riffian language, culture and Berber studies at schools and universities. A resurgent Riffian nationalism in 2010, their protests in 2013 and protests in 2017 for hogra ‚Äì a humiliating treatment by an abusive state, has drawn public attention, as well as claims of brutal suppression by Moroccan authorities.Rough in the Rif: Morocco‚Äôs unrest is worsening, The Economist (July 8 2017), Quote: \\"The trouble began in October after a fishmonger called Mouhcine Fikri was crushed by a garbage compactor at a port in Al Hoceima, which is located in the Rif, a northern mountain region with a rebellious streak. Fikri was trying to retrieve fish that had been confiscated by the authorities. To locals, his death was a striking example of hogra‚Äîhumiliating treatment by an abusive state. (...) The government has since exacerbated the situation with yet more hogra. In May it called the protesters separatists, though most are not, and suggested that they were foreign agents. (...) The unrest not only increased, but spread to other parts of the country, including Rabat, the capital, where on June 11th thousands of people rallied in support of the Rifians. All told, it is the largest display of public anger in Morocco since the Arab spring in 2011.\\" Tribes and tribal groups The Riffians are divided into these tribes and tribal groups: * Ibuqquyen, a tribal group. * Ayt Urya…£el, a tribal group. * Ayt ∆êammart, a tribal group. * Igzinnayen, a tribal group. * Ait Touzine, a tribal group. * Timsaman, a tribal group. * Ayt S…õid, a tribe. * Ayt Wuricik, a tribe. * Tafarsit, a tribe. * Ibdarsen (or Mtalsa), a tribe. * Ayt Bu Yihyi * Iqar…õayen, five tribal confederacies. * Ikebdanen (or Kebdana) * Ayt Yittuft * Ayt Bu Frah, partly arabic-speaking.

After starting out at Espanyol, he spent most of his professional career with Almer√≠a, appearing in 212 competitive matches and scoring 34 goals over six seasons, four of those in La Liga. He also played two years in England with Wigan Athletic. Club career =Early years= Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Crusat was a product of local RCD Espanyol's youth system. He played five games with the first team during the 2002‚Äì03 season, the first on 2 September 2002 in a 0‚Äì2 away loss against Real Madrid where he played five minutes as a starter, as the club went on to barely avoid La Liga relegation. Subsequently, Crusat had second division stints with Rayo Vallecano and UE Lleida: in the first, as the Madrid side was relegated, he only managed to appear five times, leaving in December 2003. =Almer√≠a= In 2005‚Äì06, Crusat joined UD Almer√≠a, being instrumental in the Andalusians' first-ever top flight promotion the following season by scoring 11 goals. He missed just four games in the subsequent eighth-place finish in the 2007‚Äì08 campaign, totalling 2,693 minutes of action. Crusat had his most successful year in the top division in 2009‚Äì10, as Almer√≠a retained its status for the third consecutive year. Without the presence of striker √Ålvaro Negredo, he was much more depended upon in scoring matters and netted seven times in 33 matches ‚Äì joint-second in the team ‚Äì as they finished in 13th position (he also collected 13 yellow cards). On 19 January 2011, Crusat scored one of Almer√≠a's most important goals, in a 3‚Äì2 win at Deportivo de La Coru√±a (4‚Äì2 on aggregate) which meant the club reached the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey for the first time ever. =Wigan Athletic= On 30 August 2011, it was confirmed by Wigan Athletic manager Roberto Mart√≠nez that his compatriot Crusat was having a medical after a ¬£2 million bid was accepted by Almer√≠a. Four days later, the player completed his move to the English club, and made his Premier League debut on 10 September, appearing as a substitute in a 0‚Äì3 away loss to Manchester City. Crusat scored his first goal for the Latics on 19 November 2011, making it 3‚Äì2 for the hosts in the 88th minute of an eventual 3‚Äì3 draw against Blackburn Rovers. He spent the vast majority of his second season on the sidelines, nursing a severe knee injury, and left the DW Stadium on 22 May 2013 after his contract expired. =Bnei Sakhnin= On 30 January 2014, after more than one year away from football, Crusat joined Bnei Sakhnin F.C. of the Israel Premier League. In September, after recurring problems in his knee, he retired at the age of 32 and with the intention of getting a manager degree.

The competition is for young dancers seeking to pursue a professional career in classical ballet, and many former prize winners of the competition are now leading stars with major ballet companies around the world. The competition is managed by a non-profit foundation organised by the Fondation en faveur de l'Art chor√©graphique and is maintained by various sponsors, patrons and donors.  History  Th√©√¢tre de Beaulieu, where the final selection is usually held Prix de Lausanne was founded in 1973 by the Swiss industrialist Philippe Braunschweig and his wife Elvire. Philippe, although not a dancer, became interested in dance as a young man. His Russian dancer wife developed his interest further. The Braunschweigs created the competition after noticing the lack of financial support to young dance students, particularly those from small regional schools, wishing to attend professional level programs. He started by approaching Rosella Hightower and Maurice B√©jart who drew up the rules for the competition. Philippe Braunschweig and Maurice B√©jart in 1988 What started as small event has grown into an internationally acclaimed institution that draws candidates from all over the world. Over the past few years the competition has seen a big boom in Asian candidates. Because of the great demand by Japanese students to study abroad, an office was also set up in Japan.25 years of the Prix de Lausanne.(1997 dance competition) The Braunschweigs announced their resignation at the end of the Prix in 1996. In March 1997, as the competition came to its 25th anniversary, the philanthropists handed over the Prix's direction to an executive committee composed of the Swiss Secretary of State, Franz Blankart and an artistic committee headed by Jan Nuyts, who worked with the Prix for many years. Mr Charles Gebhard is in charge of finances and Ms Patricia Leroy heads the actual organization. The Braunschweigs remain available as consultants and have managed to maintain the original mission of the competition.  Entry  Entry is reserved for young student-dancers, aged 15 through 18, who have not yet been in professional employment and open to candidates of all nationalities. Currently, participants are required to submit a 15‚Äì20 min digital file recording showing them performing a combination of barre and centre-work exercises in a studio environment and pay a non-refundable registration fee of CHF 120. Those candidates selected to participate in the competition pay a second fee of CHF 120. Around 80 candidates from 30 or so countries compete each year, in the hope of being selected for the final, reserved for the best 20 among them. The final of the competition is broadcast live on television. As from 2007 the Prix de Lausanne is part of an exchange program with the prestigious Youth America Grand Prix, which allows dancers from each competition to benefit from the scholarship opportunities available at both. Thanks to a mutual agreement, finalists who have not received a scholarship at one of the competitions will be eligible to participate in the other without having to pass the selective rounds. By combining their scholarship-giving capacities, these two of the most important dance competitions in the world help create a wider network of opportunity for young dancers worldwide.  Location  The Prix is held annually over a one- week period in January, usually at the Th√©√¢tre de Beaulieu in Lausanne. The dimensions of the stage of the Th√©√¢tre de Beaulieu are: wide √ó deep with a 3.6% rake. Occasionally the organization has arranged for the finals to be held in other locations: New York City in 1985, Tokyo in 1989, and Moscow in 1995, in order to accommodate the participants. During the competition, the theatre has its foyers and conference halls converted into dance studios and observation areas. The backstage area houses offices, an infirmary, and a shop that sells dance clothes, books, and videos.Inside the Prix de Lausanne: where you don't have to win  The Competition  The aim of the Prix de Lausanne is to facilitate the young competition prize-winners to embark upon a professional career by providing them with an opportunity to spend a year improving their skills at one of the Prix's partnering schools or to benefit from a year's apprentice scholarship with one of the international professional dance companies partnering the Prix.artfilm.ch - Swiss films on DVD - Prix de Lausanne 2005 Only one scholarship is available from each partner organization so decisions as to which winner is offered a place are based on their ranking.

It houses exhibits devoted to folk magic, ceremonial magic, Freemasonry, and Wicca, with its collection of such objects having been described as the largest in the world. The museum was founded by the English folk magician Cecil Williamson in 1951 to display his own personal collection of artefacts. Initially known as the Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft, it was located in the town of Castletown on the Isle of Man. Williamson was assisted at the museum by the prominent Wiccan Gerald Gardner, who remained there as \\"resident witch\\". After their friendship deteriorated, Gardner purchased it from Williamson in 1954, renaming it the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft. Gardner's Castletown museum remained open until the 1970s, when Gardner's heir Monique Wilson sold its contents to the Ripley's company. In 1954, Williamson opened his own rival back in England, known as the Museum of Witchcraft. Its first location was at Windsor, Berkshire, and the next at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire; in both cases it faced violent opposition and Williamson felt it necessary to move, establishing the museum in Boscastle in 1960. In 1996 Williamson sold the museum to Graham King, who incorporated the Richel collection of magical regalia from the Netherlands in 2000. The museum was damaged and part of its collection lost during the Boscastle flood of 2004. In 2013 ownership was transferred to Simon Costin and his Museum of British Folklore. The museum is a popular tourist attraction and is held in high esteem by the British occult community. A charity, Friends of the Museum of Witchcraft, has been established to raise funds for the exhibits. The museum also contains a large library on related topics that is accessible to researchers. History =Origins: 1947-60= A sculpture of the Horned God of Wicca at the museum After the Second World War, the former film producer Cecil Williamson decided to move into the museum business, and‚Äîprobably influenced by personal interest‚Äîdecided to open one that would be devoted to the subject of witchcraft. Williamson tried to open a museum to hold his collection of witchcraft and occult artifacts in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1947, but faced local opposition and had to abandon his plans. He then decided to open it in Castletown on the Isle of Man, an area which had much folklore surrounding fairies and witches, a tourist season, and local laws that were congenial to the establishment of a museum. He had it set up in a dilapidated old mill known locally as the Witches' Mill which he had purchased in 1948, and, at the advice of his wife, opened an adjacent restaurant, known as the Witches' Kitchen. The museum was first named the Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft. The launch of the museum was timed to coincide with the government's repeal of the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts in June 1951. In an interview with The Sunday Pictorial newspaper, Williamson claimed to be friends with at least a dozen witches, and that he had invited a coven from southern England to come and practice their rituals at his museum. The historian Ronald Hutton deemed this to \\"fairly clearly\\" be a reference to the Bricket Wood coven which was based in Hertfordshire and run by the Wiccan Gerald Gardner. In press interviews, Gardner was described as the museum's \\"resident witch\\" and performed a magical ritual at the museum's opening ceremony. For Williamson, the press interest served to promote his museum, while for Gardner it gave the opportunity to promote Wicca at a safe distance from his main coven. Williamson also had a practical interest in magic, and in a 1952 interview with popular magazine Illustrated described himself as a consultant on the subject who could help remove curses from people, akin to an old cunning man. He acknowledged that he knew many of these spells from reading about them in books. He took an interest in the late ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and wrote to Crowley's friend Gerald Yorke to enquire as to whether he could send him the instructions for any of Crowley's rituals. However, Gardner fell out with Williamson over what he saw as sensationalist displays. Williamson, in retaliation, removed a photograph of Gardner from the display. Williamson sold the museum to Gardner. =The Williamson-Gardner split: 1953‚Äì64= Williamson decided to return to England, and took his collection of witchcraft artefacts with him. In 1954 Gardner bought the Witches' Mill from him, and renamed it The Museum of Magic and Witchcraft, filling it with his own collection of artefacts. During the 1950s, Gardner discussed moving his museum to London with his then friend, Charles Cardell, but decided not to. Page 88 According to the historian Ronald Hutton, this left Gardner with \\"a secure and congenial base\\" from which he could promote Wicca by writing such books as Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959). Gardner continued to run the museum till his death in 1964, when it was briefly run by his High Priestess Monique Wilson before it was shut down and the collection sold off. Ripley's Entertainment Inc. bought the collection and in 1972 opened the \\"Museum of Witchcraft and Magic\\" at Gatlinburg, TN and San Francisco, CA. In 1975, due to pressure from the local church and religious groups, Ripley's changed the name of the museums to the \\"World of the Unexplained\\". More attractions and items were added to the present witchcraft collection. In 1985, Ripley's closed both museums due to poor ticket sales. The collection was disbursed to other Ripley's museums. A lot of the witchcraft collection was sent to Ripley's Believe It or Not museum at Blackpool, England. In his will, Gardner left the museum to his assistant there, with the proviso that if he did not want it then it would go to his initiate Monique Wilson, which is what happened. On his return to England in 1954, Williamson opened the museum, now known as the Museum of Witchcraft, to Windsor. Here it stayed open for the tourist season, and was quite successful, but local opinion was still against it, and so Williamson decided to move it again. In 1954 Williamson moved the museum to Bourton-on-the-Water in Gloucestershire. The museum suffered various persecutions, including signs being painted on walls and dead cats hung from trees, and eventually it was largely damaged in an arson attack. =Boscastle: 1960-present= In 1960 Williamson moved the museum to Boscastle in Cornwall. Williamson displayed some artefacts associated with ceremonial magic, but was largely interested in folk magic and the practices of what he called the \\"wayside witch\\". The exterior of the museum Williamson retired in 1996, selling the museum to Graham King and Liz Crow. A practising Pagan with interests in witchcraft, King owned a business manufacturing specialist cameras in Hampshire when he discovered that the museum was for sale in a newspaper article. King and Williamson finalised the purchase at midnight on Halloween 1996. King and Crow reorganised the museum and removed some of the more sensationalist exhibits, such as a partially clothed female mannequin which had been laid on an altar to represent the Black Mass. King appeared on BBC television series such as A Seaside Parish and Antiques Roadshow. He organised the burial of Joan Wytte, a woman who died in Bodmin Jail under accusations of witchcraft in 1813, and whose corpse had been at the museum for many years. She was buried in a local area of woodland in 1998. The museum was damaged during heavy floods in August 2004, resulting in it being closed for repairs until March 2005. After King took over, a group known as the Friends of the Museum was established; it holds an annual weekend of lectures. It was subsequently converted into a charity. To commemorate the museum's sixtieth anniversary, in 2011 the Occult Art Company published an anthology entitled The Museum of Witchcraft: A Magical History. The idea for the work had been provided by the chair of the Friends, Judith Noble, with the volume itself being edited by Kerrian Godwin. It contained contributions from 51 individuals involved in the esoteric and Pagan communities, including prominent figures like Ronald Hutton, Philip Heselton, Patricia Crowther, and Marian Green. Reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in The Pomegranate journal, he welcomed the volume yet described its contents as a \\"mixed bag, with the articles varying in their quality and relevance to the subject at hand.\\" On Halloween 2013 King transferred ownership of the Museum, its collection and library, to the designer and curator Simon Costin, who had founded the Museum of British Folklore in 2009. King retained ownership of the museum's building, which was leased to Costin's Museum. Costin informed the Cornish Guardian that \\"The museum will continue to run exactly as it is. It won't change at all.\\" Exhibits Model of a cunning woman at the museum In keeping with Williamson's original plan, most of the exhibits in the museum feature artefacts related to historical folk magic and the cunning folk. This includes a room which recreates a tradition cunning woman's cottage, termed \\"Joan's cottage\\", with a mannequin of a nineteenth century cunning woman, surrounded by various herbs and divination tools. The museum also contains exhibits devoted to the witch trials in the early modern period, the modern Pagan religion of Wicca, as well as other esoteric practices such as ceremonial magic, Freemasonry, and alchemy. There is also a small case on modern religious Satanism, in which a distinction is drawn between it and modern Pagan witchcraft. A number of artefacts in the collection were owned by prominent figures in the history of magic and witchcraft; it contains a ritual chalice used by the Thelemite magician Aleister Crowley, talismans created by Gerald Gardner, and ritual swords and an altar slab formerly owned by the noted Wiccan Alex Sanders. The museum's collection of artefacts continues to grow with new acquisitions. Many contemporary practitioners of witchcraft and magic have bequeathed their working tools to the museum in their wills. According to the anthropologist Helen Cornish, the exhibits in the museum \\"work to build narratives that illustrate witchcraft over time, and situate it as a significant force in the present\\". Reception In The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca, Rosemary Ellen Guiley described it as the \\"world's largest collection of paraphernalia and artifacts related to folk magic, witchcraft, Wicca and ritual magic\\". The museum functions as an information resource centre for media and the public. An independent organisation, the Friends of the Museum of Witchcraft, operates to raise funds through which to purchase further items for the collection. It also acts as a meeting place for Wiccans and other Pagans. According to Doyle White, the museum has become \\"something akin to a site of pilgrimage\\" for British Witches, with a \\"special and irreplaceable place in the hearts of many in the British occult community.\\" Cornish conducted ethnographic research among the local Witches who had relationships with the museum in the late 1990s and early 2000s. She found that there were mixed views on aspects of the museum. Commenting on the \\"Joan's cottage\\" room, she found that some Witches felt that it provided \\"a marker of historical identification, and illustrates the ways that independent, rural magical workers provide a central focus and source of heritage, while for others it indicates an ongoing problem of romanticized historical invention.\\" Various practitioners interviewed by Cornish were sceptical about the claims that Williamson had made for many of the artefacts which he placed on exhibit, questioning whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant their continued display.

The class included two other vessels, and . The Zentas were intended to serve as fleet scouts and to guard the battleships against attacks by torpedo boats. She carried a main battery of eight guns manufactured by ≈†koda; Zenta and her sisters were the first major warships of the Austro-Hungarian fleet to be armed entirely with domestically produced guns. Unlike earlier Austro-Hungarian cruisers, the Zenta class discarded heavy belt armor in favor of a higher top speed. After entering service in 1899, Zenta was sent to East Asia to represent Austria-Hungary in the region. She was involved in the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900, sending landing parties ashore as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance to guard the Legation Quarter and to fight in the Battle of the Taku Forts. Zenta returned home in 1901 and was sent on another long-distance cruise in 1902‚Äì1903 to visit various ports in Africa and South America. The ship served in home waters beginning in 1904, spending her time with training exercises. In 1913, during the First Balkan War, she participated in the blockade of Montenegro by an international fleet. At the start of World War I in July 1914, Zenta was sent to the southern end of the Adriatic Sea to attack targets in Montenegro. She was cruising off that country's coast to enforce another blockade on 16 August when she and the destroyer encountered the main French battle fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Antivari, Zenta was sunk by the French battleships, with heavy loss of life as the French failed to pick up survivors. Some 139 men, including her commander Paul Pachner, swam to shore, where they were captured by Montenegrin forces and imprisoned until 1916 when the Austro-Hungarian Army overran the country. Design Line-drawing of the Zenta class In January 1895, the senior officers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy decided to build two types of modern cruisers: large armored cruisers of around and smaller vessels of around . The latter were intended to screen the battleships of the main fleet, scouting for enemy vessels and protecting them from torpedo boat attacks. The chief constructor, Josef Kuchinka, prepared the initial design based on specifications that had been issued by the naval command, though by the time his design was finally approved in mid-1897, it had grown in size to around . Final approval came after work on the first unit, Zenta, had already begun. Zenta was long at the waterline and long overall; she had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced normally and at full load. The crew of the Zentas numbered 308 officers and enlisted men. Their propulsion system consisted of a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a screw propeller using steam provided by eight coal-fired Yarrow boilers. Their engines were rated to produce for a top speed of , although Zenta reached a speed of from during her sea trials on 30 March 1899. The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of at . To increase their range, the cruisers were fitted with a brigantine-sailing rig of on their two masts. The Zentas' main battery consisted of eight 40-caliber quick-firing guns manufactured by ≈†koda. One gun was mounted on the upper deck forward, six in casemates in the hull, and the remaining gun was placed on the upper deck aft. They also carried eight 44-caliber ≈†koda guns and two 33-caliber 47 mm Hotchkiss guns for defense against torpedo boats. These guns were all mounted individually, with four in the superstructure and the rest in casemates in the hull. The ships also carried a pair of Salvator-Dormus M1893 machine guns. Their armament was rounded out with a pair of torpedo tubes that were carried in the hull above the waterline. The three Zenta-class cruisers were the first major Austro-Hungarian warships to carry an armament entirely manufactured by ≈†koda. Their armor deck consisted of two layers of steel over the bow and stern. Amidships, where it protected the propulsion machinery spaces, it doubled in thickness to a pair of layers. The casemates for the primary guns had thick sides and the conning tower received two layers of 25 mm plate on the sides. Each of the 120 mm guns was protected by a gun shield, although they were not large enough to provide good cover for the gun crews. Service history Zenta at anchor =Construction and deployment to China, 1896‚Äì1901= Zenta, ordered under the contract name Ersatz (replacement) , was laid down at the Pola Navy Yard on 8 August 1896 and was launched on 18 August 1897, the birthday of Kaiser Franz Joseph I. The ship was christened by his sister-in-law, Archduchess Maria Josepha. Fitting-out work was delayed by shortages of the 12 cm guns, since four of the guns that were slated to be installed aboard the ship were instead diverted to Spain on 11 July, which was in need of additional weapons as it was in the midst of fighting the Cuban War of Independence. Additional guns were ordered on 27 April 1898 and were delivered on 22 April 1899. Named for the Battle of Zenta, the ship was completed on 25 May, at a cost of 4.2 million krone, commissioned three days later, and was ordered to deploy to East Asia to serve as the station ship in Chinese waters. She left Pola on 10 November 1899 and relieved the homeward- bound station ship, the protected cruiser , in Colombo, British Ceylon between 22 and 28 December. The ship arrived in Singapore on 3 January 1900 and then continued on to Hong Kong. Zenta embarked on a tour of ports in China in February, including those along the Yangtze River, before returning to Shanghai on 7 May. From there, she crossed to Japan, where the ship was on 30 May when the worsening Boxer Rebellion prompted the European diplomats in the country to request forces to guard the Legation Quarter. Zenta joined the international fleet that assembled as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance off the Taku Forts on 2 June; she operated there for the next twenty days. On 3 June, a landing party led by the ship's captain, Eduard von Montalmar, that consisted of one officer, two officer cadets, and thirty enlisted men went ashore to relieve the Legations; they helped to guard the embassies there during the siege of the Legations for the next two months. Another party, consisting of an officer, three cadets, and seventy-three men joined the force that stormed the Taku Forts on 17 June. Von Montalmar and three sailors were killed during the war with another four sailors later dying of their wounds. Zenta moved to Chefoo from 23 to 25 June and then returned to Taku from 26 June to 5 August. The armored cruiser arrived in Taku two days later and her commander took control of Austro-Hungarian naval forces in the region. On 24 November, the ship returned to Japan, where she was briefly drydocked for maintenance in December. In early January 1901, Zenta then sailed south to Bangkok, Siam, arriving there on 17 January. The ship arrived in Hong Kong on 15 February to begin a tour of Chinese ports that lasted through May. She next visited Chemulpo in Korea later that month, followed by a brief stop in Japan. The ship returned to Chinese waters for the next two months before she received orders to return home. Zenta left China on 25 July and reached Pola on 1 October and was thereafter placed in reserve. =African cruise, 1902‚Äì1903= Zenta at anchor Zenta spent most of 1902 in reserve, but she was reactivated late in the year for a training cruise to Africa and South America. She left Pola on 15 October and reached Mombasa, British Kenya, on 22 November. From there, the ship cruised to Zanzibar and by 6 December had arrived in Diego Suarez, French Madagascar. Later that month, Zenta visited Tamatave, Madagascar, and Saint-Louis on the island of R√©union. On 2 January 1903, she got underway for Delagoa Bay and Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese Mozambique. Zenta then proceeded to Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, and Cape Town in the British Cape Colony and Colony of Natal through early March. She then passed to the Atlantic coast of southern Africa, stopping in German Southwest Africa and then visited Luanda in Portuguese Angola. At the end of March, the ship stopped in Banana and Boma in the Congo Free State, entering the Congo River and steaming to Matadi, Congo on 1 April. From Congo, Zenta dropped anchor in Saint Helena on the way to South America before arriving at Santos, Brazil, on 8 May. Later that month visited Montevideo, Uruguay, staying there until 6 June when she crossed the R√≠o de la Plata to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The next day, she entered the Paran√° River and traveled to Rosario, Argentina, for two days before returning to Buenos Aires. Zenta then returned to Brazilian waters before returning to western Africa, arriving in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 22 July. The ship then continued north, stopping in Dakar, French Senegal a week later and then Tenerife in the Canary Islands in Spain, arriving there in early August. She arrived at Funchal on the island of Madeira later that month. The ship next visited several ports in French North Africa along with M√°laga, Spain, through September. From there, she began the last leg of the trip, stopping in Corfu, Greece from 22 September and then passing through Trieste on 2 October, where she was present for the launching of the pre-dreadnought battleship . The ship arrived back in Pola four days later. =Service in home waters, 1904‚Äì1914= Zenta in port with awnings erected From 1 January 1904 to 15 June, Zenta served as the flotilla leader for the Torpedo-boat Flotilla of the main fleet. During this period, on 20 January, the Hungarian shipping company Adria requested the navy's assistance with locating the merchant ship , which had departed Venice on 12 January and had not been seen since. Zenta and a pair of torpedo boats conducted a search, but did not locate the vessel. The summer's training activities began on 15 June, and throughout the maneuvers, which lasted through 15 September, Zenta continued in her role as the flotilla leader. She was present for a visit of the British Royal Navy in Pola, including the pre-dreadnought , the cruisers and , and the torpedo gunboat . The rest of the year was spent in dry dock to have her bow 12 cm guns altered, wireless equipment installed, and repairs made to her bow after a collision with a merchant ship in Trieste. Zenta rejoined the main fleet on 1 January 1905, resuming her role as a flotilla leader. The year followed the same schedule as the previous year, with the summer training program beginning on 15 June and ending on 15 September. Zenta was present for the launching of the battleship on 21 May that year. She was placed in reserve toward the end of the year and remained out of service into 1906, only being recommissioned for the summer maneuvers, which again lasted from 15 June to 15 September. During the maneuvers, which concluded with a simulated amphibious assault that was observed by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, she served with the battleships of II Heavy Division. Following the exercises, the fleet held a naval review off Calamotta on 15 September, after which Zenta was reduced to reserve status. She again spent 1907 out of service except for the summer exercises, partially due to repairs to her double bottom; in 1908, she was not activated at all. On 16 March 1909, Zenta was recommissioned to join an international naval demonstration off the coast of the Levant; the Austro-Hungarian contingent also included the armored cruiser and the torpedo gunboat . The ships left Pola on 22 April and steamed to Piraeus, Greece, where they joined the international fleet and stayed from 26 April to 2 May. Zenta patrolled off Mersin and Antioch, Ottoman Turkey, for several weeks before returning to Greece on the 16th. She remained there until 5 June when she departed for Teodo, Montenegro, arriving three days later. Zenta was present for the launching of the pre-dreadnought in Trieste on 3 July and was thereafter placed in reserve. She was reactivated on 15 June for the maneuvers. Another training amphibious operation was conducted on 24 August, with Zenta assigned to the defending force. She was decommissioned again on 31 August. The ship was only intermittently in service for the next several years, attending the launching of the pre-dreadnought on 12 April 1910 and then observing the launching of the dreadnought battleship in Trieste on 24 June 1911. During this time she had a new radio transmitter installed. During the First Balkan War of 1913, an international fleet was composed to blockade Montenegro over its occupation of the port of Scutari. Zenta was sent as part of the Austro-Hungarian contingent, departing Pola on 19 March and two days later she arrived to patrol off Meljine. The ship saw little activity for the rest of the year, and on 1 April 1914, she was assigned to a training cruise in company with the old coastal defense ships and with a contingent of 240 naval cadets. While in Gravosa on 10 April, the crew was exposed to an outbreak of meningitis; one man fell ill and had to be sent ashore in Ragusa the next day. The infection began to spread and on 1 May, another man had to be hospitalized in Cattaro; Zenta was ordered to return to Pola to be quarantined in Fasana the next day. Forty of the cadets were sent ashore to be hospitalized, another sixty were transferred to the tender , and the remainder were kept aboard to help disinfect the ship. The quarantine was lifted fifteen days later on 17 May. =World War I= Painting showing SMS Zenta and SMS Ulan in action on 16 August 1914 At the start of World War I in July 1914, Zenta was assigned to I Cruiser Division, which at that time included the armored cruisers , Kaiser Karl VI, Kaiserin und K√∂nigin Maria Theresia, and the other two Zenta-class cruisers, under the command of Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. On 8 August, Zenta and her sister ship steamed south to bombard the wireless station at Antivari. The ships of I Cruiser Division then began a blockade of the coast of Montenegro. Eight days later, Zenta sortied again, now in company with the destroyer to patrol the blockade line off Teodo. The same day, the main French fleet, the 1er Arm√©e Navale (1st Naval Army) under Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re's command, entered the southern Adriatic to search for the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Battle of Antivari At around 08:30, lookouts in the French fleet spotted smoke on the horizon as they steamed north, prompting Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re to turn his ships to investigate. The Austro-Hungarians had in turn spotted the approaching French fleet, and so moved closer to shore to flee north, hoping the coastline would obscure them. At 09:03, the French fleet encountered Zenta and Ulan off the coast of Montenegro and opened fire, though Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re initially ordered his battleships to fire warning shots, but this caused confusion among the fleet's gunners. Zenta, commanded by Paul Pachner, turned to engage the French while Ulan fled to the north at high speed. Zenta came under a hail of French gunfire, though the sheer volume hampered French gunnery, as it was impossible to determine each ships' fall of shot. Zenta fired her 12 cm guns, though they fell some short, and would not have inflicted damage on the heavily armored battleships in any event. The slower Zenta attempted to evade French gunfire, but she quickly received several hits that disabled her engines and set her on fire by about 09:12. At 09:20, Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re ordered his ships to cease fire, by which time Zenta was burning badly and settling by the stern. By 09:30, Zentas bow lurched upward at an angle of 45 degrees and quickly sank around off the coast of Castellastua, her flags still flying. Her crew suffered heavy casualties in the battle, with 173 men killed, though 139, including Pachner, managed to swim to shore. The French failed to pick up survivors, as Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re assumed that Zentas boats could pick them up, or they could swim to shore. They were captured by Montenegrin forces and imprisoned as prisoners of war in Podgorica. By early 1916, the Austro- Hungarian Army had defeated Montenegro and the survivors from Zenta were freed. Ulan, meanwhile, successfully fled north, having been pursued by the French destroyer screen and the armored cruiser .

It is a Grade II* listed building. The original tower house built for the Beadnall family in the early 15th century was a four-storey construction which was reduced in height in the 17th century when Nicholas Fenwick (Mayor of Newcastle 1720) converted the building into a country house. Despite substantial alterations and improvements by architect William Newton in the late 18th century, the property had become a roofless ruin by the end of the 19th century. It was completely restored by Sir Stephen Aitchison (see Aitchison baronets), who acquired the ruinous property in 1913. In 1927 Aitchison bought an column, designed by Sir John Soane dedicated to the memory of members of the Evelyn family of Felbridge, Surrey, which he dismantled and re-erected in the grounds at Lemmington. In 1825 the property was acquired by William Pawson of Shawdon Hall (High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1826) and in 1947 was converted for use as a convent for the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. More recently the house has been used as a residential care home. The hall has recently been renovated; it is under ownership of the Ruff family. The Ruff family also own a selection of animals on the Lemmington Hall estate including peacocks and peahens.

Club career Ort√≠z was born in Almer√≠a, Andalusia. After beginning playing with hometown club UD Almer√≠a (then in the third division), he served an uneventful stint abroad with Italy's Ravenna Calcio. Upon his return to Almer√≠a, Ortiz helped the side achieve promotion to the second level in 2002, scoring five goals in the following campaign, notably a brace against neighbours Xerez CD in a 6‚Äì0 home rout. He played with the team in every professional level, starting in division four. Ortiz, who was the undisputed captain when in the starting XI, finished as Almer√≠a's third-best scorer in 2006‚Äì07 as they reached La Liga for the first time in their history. He netted ten goals (behind only Albert Crusat and M√≠chel), appearing in 24 games the following campaign mainly as a substitute. On 3 January 2010, after just five minutes on the pitch, Ortiz scored his only goal of the season, a last-minute winner which was the only in the home fixture against neighbours Xerez as both sides struggled immensely in the league; Almer√≠a had just recently fired manager Hugo S√°nchez, but the player's role remained obscure under new boss Juan Manuel Lillo (he totalled 17 appearances, all from the bench, in only 226 minutes).

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Great Budworth. It is one of three parish churches in the parish of Aston-by-Sutton, Little Leigh and Lower Whitley. The other two being St Michael and All Angels, Little Leigh and St Luke, Lower Whitley. The three were previously individual parishes united in a benefice along with St Mark, Antrobus. The listing describes it as \\"a most pleasing late 17th to early 18th-century church, inside and out\\". The church stands in a relatively isolated position in the south side of Aston Lane in the hamlet. History =Early history= The first religious building in the hamlet was a chapel of ease in the parish of Runcorn built in 1236 by Sir Thomas de Dutton which was known as the chapel of Poosey (or Pooseye). Towards the end of the 13th century the bishop of Lichfield (in whose diocese the chapel then was) received a complaint and he gave orders that a chaplain and a lamp should be provided by the prior of Norton Priory. The chapel remained in use until a domestic chapel was built at Dutton Hall and Poosey chapel fell into decay and became a ruin. The first chapel on the site of the present church was built in the early 16th century, not later than 1542. All that remains of this chapel is a stone in the churchyard which has been used for sharpening spears and knives. This chapel was damaged in the Civil War. In 1637 the chapel was refurnished and restored by Sir Thomas Aston. Following this the present chancel was built in 1697 for Sir Willoughby Aston, the architect being Thomas Webb, and the mason has been named as Edward Nixon.The diary of Sir Willoughby Aston contains references to John Vanbrugh, suggesting that he was involved with the rebuilding of the church. (Richards, p. 124.) The nave was reconstructed between 1736 and 1740. By 1857 the Aston family pews on the north and south sides of the chancel had been replaced by choirstalls. An organ chamber was added to the south side of the chancel in 1897, obliterating one of the windows. It was rebuilt in 1907. =Bomb damage= The church was badly damaged by a land mine on 28 November 1940; damage was caused to the roof and the interior of the church. The roof was replaced but the church was still unusable and services were held elsewhere. It remained derelict until restoration began on 30 May 1949; this was completed in June 1950. The church was re-hallowed on 27 June 1950 by the Bishop of Chester. Until it was damaged by the land mine, it was one of the least restored early Georgian churches in the diocese of Chester. The damage mainly involved the south side and the east end of the church. The south porch was completely destroyed, as was the organ chamber in the chancel. Also destroyed were the sundial over the south porch and the stone cross on the gable at the east end. In 2004 the church received a grant of ¬£35,000 under the Repair Grants for Places of Worship scheme. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in Runcorn sandstone with a roof of grey slate tiles. Its plan consists of a chancel and nave, north and south porches, a western tower on which is a cupola belfry. The cupola has a circular window with a clock above it. There is a circular east window with a niche on either side. The three-bay chancel is narrower than the nave; both are surmounted by a plain parapet. There are no windows on the north side of the chancel, but a door is present which formerly led to the part of the churchyard reserved for burial of the lord of the manor and his family. On the south side were three round-headed windows, two of which are original and the other restored after the bomb damage. On each side of the nave are three round-headed windows, similar to those in the chancel. Between the nave and chancel, on both north and south sides, are buttresses. The north porch is dated 1736 and is in the style of Vanburgh. The south porch and the sundial, damaged in the explosion, have been restored. The authors of the Buildings of England series comment that the architectural style of the nave is Georgian, and that of the chancel is pre-Georgian. =Interior= The floor of the chancel is original, dating from the 17th century, and consists of square white stones with insets of black marble at the intersections. The west gallery is now occupied by an organ which was built in 1906 by Ernest Wadsworth Ltd and installed in 1908. It is supported by four wooden piers. On its front are panels above which is a cornice decorated with dentilling. It is accessed by a circular staircase with rails on balusters. The pews are of oak, as is the pulpit which probably dates from the 17th century. The pulpit is carried on an octagonal stalk, and is decorated with scrolls and pendants. The altar table also dates from the 17th century, and is in Jacobean style. The ceiling is plastered and has an oval-ended central panel. Over the south door are royal arms dated 1664 and over the north door is a heraldic panel dating from the early 18th century relating to the Aston family. The font dates from 1857. It is in carved timber, contains a marble bowl, and has a domed lid. Also in the church is an armorial board of the Aston family. This probably dates from 1636, was perhaps painted by Randle Holme, and has since been repainted. The memorials include two similar painted and gilded tablets in the chancel to members of the Aston family who died in 1635 and 1637 respectively; they include columns, putti, and broken pediments. Another monument built in 1637 is to the memory of two other members of the family; it consists of a tablet on a sarcophagus surrounded by drapery. There is a monument to Sir Willoughby Aston who died in 1702 consisting of a shield held by putti under a baldacchino; this has been attributed to Grinling Gibbons. One of the monuments is to a steward of the family who died in 1706. Other memorials to the family date from 1737 to the 19th century. Following the land mine damage, the organ was rebuilt by Jardine & Co Ltd. The single church bell is inscribed \\"Crescent city 1870\\" and is thought to have originally been a ship's bell. The parish registers of baptisms and deaths both date from 1635, but both have gaps. The churchwardens' accounts begin in 1761 and are complete. External features Two portions of the sandstone churchyard wall dating probably from the late 17th century and the lych gate dated 1908 are listed Grade II. In the churchyard is a former red sandstone font dating probably from the early 17th century which is listed Grade II. It has a circular base and an arched cover carved from two blocks of stone, which is unique in Cheshire. Also listed Grade II are tombs to William and Mary Okell, dated 1837, John Okell and others, dated 1697, James Okell and others, dated 1748, John Burke (?), dated 1713, John Egerton, dated 1652, Edward and Mary Woodhouse, dated 1718, Mary Fletcher, dated 1776, Mary and Robert Okell, dated 1770, and Roll Okell and others, dated 1775. Another memorial in the churchyard is the grave of Chloe. Chloe was a slave from Gambia who was born around 1760 and who arrived in Liverpool in 1767. She spent her life as a servant to the Aston family, being given the surname of Gambia, and rose to the position of housekeeper. She died from breast cancer in 1838. The inscription on her gravestone reads: > Chloe Gambia a negress Who died at Aston Hall the 12th Sept. 1838 aged 77 > years or thereabouts. She lived in the Aston family 70 years. Also in the churchyard are two war graves of World War I soldiers of the King's Liverpool Regiment.

He formed one of the earliest dojang's for hapkido in the United States in Torrance, California, and has been featured in many magazine articles promoting the art. Life Kwon was born in Andong in what is now South Korea. His first exposure to the martial arts was at the age of seven, when he began studying taekwondo. During that period of time, following the Korean War, Korea was in a period of rebuilding its physical and cultural landscape. Formal dojangs, had not yet been constructed. Thus, the taekwondo classes Kwon attended were taught in warehouse and in fields. At the age of seven won found himself to be little and weak. Even after studying taekwondo for almost three years, he realized he could not compete with the larger boys around him by fighting with taekwondo's aggressive styling. He began to look for other forms of the martial arts to satisfy his specific needs.\\" Scott Shaw, Tae Man Kwon: Hapkido's Philosophy Converted to Combat, Inside Taekwondo Magazine, page 28. September 1995. In 1956 he began his study of hapkido with Ji Han Jae in Andong.Master Kwon Tae Man's bio At this point in history the art was still using the name Hapki Yu Kwon Sool. This was the first dojang, or martial arts school, that Master Ji opened and so the practitioners there, along with those who started training at Suh Bok Sup's Yu Kwon Sool dojang in Daegu, were among the first to train in the art. The school was called the An Moo Kwan. Some of Kwon's fellow students at that time were Yu Yong-Woo and Oh Se-lim (future president of the Korea Hapkido Federation).Kimm, He-Young. Hapkido (alternately The Hapkido Bible). Andrew Jackson Press, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 1991 In 1957 Kwon moved to Seoul and continued to study under Master Ji at the first school for the art which was located in the nation's capital. The school was located in the Majang-dong district and among the other students who studied with Kwon there were Hwang Duk-Kyu ( Ji's first student in Seoul ), Kang Jong-Soo, Myung Kwang-Sik, Kim Yong-Jin, Lee Tae-Jon and shortly afterward Jung Won-Son and Lee Dong-Koo. The following year, in 1958, when the school moved to the Joongbooshijang, the central market area of the city, Kwon's fellow students were Choi Seo-Oh (first hapkido teacher in the U.S.), Myung Jae-Nam (the Founder of the International Hapkido Federation in Korea and later Hankido) and Han Bong-Soo (who would become one of the foremost promoters of the art abroad.) Although Kwon started training earlier than many of the senior hapkido people, such as Master Bong Soo Han, he was younger and therefore initially was given fewer responsibilities than his older colleagues. Over time however his position grew within the largest hapkido association of the time, the Korea Hapkido Association. Accomplishments In 1964 he opened his first hapkido dojang in Incheon where he instructed U.S. Army personnel stationed there.Tedeschi, Marc. Hapkido; Traditions, Philosophy, Technique. Weatherhill, Trumbull, 2000 In 1967 Kwon was sent by the Korean Hapkido Association to be part of a demonstration team to Vietnam teaching Korean, US, and Vietnamese troops as well as Special Forces. In 1971 he was promoted to master instructor by the Korea Hapkido Association and became its chief judge for testing and promotions. Personal life Kwon immigrated to California in the United States in 1973, first opening a school in Palos Verdes and later in Torrance. There, he and fellow students Kim Chong-Sung and Han Bong-Soo formed an early hapkido association and worked together to promote the art and support each other's efforts.

It includes three separate sub-species: * A. i. hedleyi * A. i. iredalei * A. i. rosinae This thornbill can be found in shrublands and salt marshes, typically those around salt lakes or low heath on sand plains. It eats mostly insects and spiders captured in the shrubs of its habitat. It rarely feeds on the ground, preferring instead the higher elevations of shrubs and trees. The slender-billed thornbill is rarely observed alone. They are usually seen in flocks of approximately eight birds or in pairs. Thornbill nests are small and built in low shrubs. They are constructed of grass, bark, cobwebs, and other shrubland debris. Females lay up to three eggs during the breeding season, which runs from July until November. Description The thornbill ranges from 9 to 10 centimeters in length. The colour of its back ranges from olive-grey to a darker olive-brown. The base of its tail is olive- yellow. Its underbelly is a smooth cream colour, and it has a dark bill and pale eyes.

Origins Born at Latchford on 9 June 1762, he was the eldest son of John Drinkwater (1740-1797), a surgeon in the Royal Navy, and his first wife Elizabeth Andrews. Career At the age of fifteen he joined the 72nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Manchester Volunteers) as an ensign and was almost immediately posted to Gibraltar. From June 1779 to February 1783 this small British possession was under siege from French and Spanish forces, during which time he kept a careful record of events. When peace came, he had become a captain but his regiment was sent back to Britain and disbanded. From his notes he wrote A history of the late siege of Gibraltar, 1779‚Äì1783, with a description and account of that garrison from the earliest period, published in 1785, which was widely read and frequently reprinted. As a soldier, Drinkwater was more interested in the military than in the civil aspects, yet his account does give some glimpses of the sufferings of the civilians. In 1787 he rejoined the British Army in the 2nd Battalion of the 1st (Royal) Regiment of Foot and returned to Gibraltar. There he was publicly thanked by the military commander, General Eliott, for his book and was given funds to establish the Gibraltar Garrison Library. The regiment was then sent to defend Toulon against the French, where he acted as military secretary until the British had to evacuate in December 1793. From there, he served under the viceroy, Sir Gilbert Eliott, as military secretary and deputy judge-advocate of the Kingdom of Corsica until the French captured the island in October 1796. He returned to England with Sir Gilbert in the captured French frigate HMS Minerve. Under Captain George Cockburn, it carried the flag of Commodore Horatio Nelson, whom Drinkwater had made friends with in Corsica. On the way they encountered a Spanish fleet off Cape St Vincent and were involved in the ensuing battle. Drinkwater thought that the achievements of Nelson, who was not mentioned in the published dispatches, had been underestimated and he published anonymously A Narrative of the Battle of St Vincent to do justice to his friend. His next post was again administrative, to sort out the complicated finances of the British occupations of Toulon and Corsica. Between 1794 and 1796 he became first a major and then a lieutenant-colonel, after which he was placed on half-pay with the rank of colonel. In 1799 he married, and was also appointed commissary general of the British forces in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, where he served until evacuation in November 1799. In 1801 he was appointed to the household of the King's brother, the Duke of Kent, who became a close friend. In 1805 he was nominated a member of the parliamentary commission of military inquiry, becoming its chairman later. His experience there led to the offer of a ministerial post in 1807, to serve under William Windham as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, but he declined. In 1811 he was appointed comptroller of army accounts, and held the office for 25 years until it was abolished in 1835. As well as his administrative duties, he was a director of the Regent's Canal Company, earning respect for handling the company's financial crises until the canal opened in 1820. The entrance to Thorncroft Manor, his last home His last years were spent at Thorncroft Manor, just outside Leatherhead, where although almost totally blind he carried on his literary work. Dying there on 16 January 1844, he was buried at the Church of St Mary & St Nicholas, Leatherhead.Leatherhead parish church, where he is buried Family On 6 June 1799 at St Mary's Church, Putney, he married Eleanor (1766‚Äì1848), daughter of Charles Congalton, a captain in the Royal Navy who was laird of Congalton, and his wife Anne, daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Baronet, of Minto. Her portrait by Henry Raeburn is in the Hermitage Museum at St Petersburg.Eleanor, his wife She had two older brothers, William and Gilbert, who in turn inherited the estate of Balfour in Fife, which had belonged to the Bethune family since about 1375, and changed their name to Bethune. When Gilbert died in 1837 without children, Eleanor was his heir and became the lady of Balfour. She and her husband both changed their name to Bethune. They had seven children, including: :Eleanor, who married the Reverend William Thomas Hadow and was the grandmother of Sir William Henry Hadow. :John, a civil servant remembered for promoting women's education in India. :Charles, who rose to Admiral in the Royal Navy and was the father of Lieutenant-General Edward Cecil Bethune. :Mary, who married Norman James Biggs Uniacke. :Georgiana, who married Henry Malden.

Biography Vitali was born in Bellano, on Lake Como, into a family of fishermen. He began painting when he was fifteen, after having worked at the Institute of Graphic Arts of Bergamo. In 1947 he exhibited his first work at the Angelicum Gallery in Milan, on the occasion of the biennial exhibition of sacred art. In the following edition in 1949, the two works he exhibited, Visitazione and Cena in Emmaus, were met with great appreciation by Carlo Carr√†. Vitali was awarded a fellowship from the Brera Academy in Milan but because he wasn't able to support himself he was force to reject it. In 1981 his son Velasco Vitali, also a painter, encouraged Giancarlo to start working as an engraver. In 1983 critic and writer Giovanni Testori, expressed the wish to meet Vitali after seeing one of his paintings depicting a quartered rabbit. The meeting generated a profound and solid relationship, founded on mutual esteem and admiration, which later became a long deep-rooted friendship. In 1984 Testori wrote an article about Vitai's work in the third page of Corriere della Sera and went on to organize his first solo exhibition at La Compagnia del Disegno in Milan. Vitali would later have several exhibitions in public and private institutions and released a series of catalogues and engravings portfolios. At the end of the 1980s he realized many public art works, including The Portrays of Benefactors at Ospedale Maggiore in Milan commissioned by the Foundation Ca' Granda.

Planned to include law courts, a council chamber, offices, a public hall, and a suite of ceremonial rooms, it was built between 1853 and 1858 to a design by the architect Cuthbert Brodrick. With the building of the Civic Hall in 1933, some of these functions were relocated, and after the construction of the Leeds Crown Court in 1993, the Town Hall now serves mainly as a concert, conference and wedding venue, its offices still used by some council departments. It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1951. Imagined as a municipal palace to demonstrate the power and success of Victorian Leeds, and opened by Queen Victoria in a lavish ceremony in 1858, it is one of the largest town halls in the United Kingdom. With a height of it was the tallest building in Leeds for 108 years from 1858 until 1966, when it lost the title to the Park Plaza Hotel, which stands taller at . The distinctive baroque clock tower, which serves as a landmark and a symbol of Leeds, was not part of the initial design but was added by Brodrick in 1856 as the civic leaders sought to make an even grander statement. The project to build the Town Hall came about as Leeds underwent rapid growth and industrialisation during the 19th century, helped by a desire to compete with Bradford and symbolise Leeds's dominance within the region. Proceedings began in July 1850, carried through by a dedicated committee of the Town Council, which held a competition selecting the relatively unknown Brodrick to prepare a design, with construction underway by July 1853. The building cost much more than the original estimates due to rising prices and constant additions to its design throughout construction. The form of Leeds Town Hall has been used as a model for civic buildings across Britain and the British Empire, being one of the largest and earliest. As a key heritage asset for the city, its history as a court and prison is demonstrated in guided tours for the public. Several recurring cultural events use the Town Hall as a performance space, such as the Leeds International Piano Competition. Description :See also: alt=A life-sized statue of a lion, its face eroded from weathering Victoria Hall showing the alt=A large decorated hall with a pipe organ and stage The Town Hall is classical in style but suggestive of power and drama. It stands at the top of a flight of steps on a mound made specially for the purpose of increasing its prominent position. The south, principal facade to The Headrow has a deeply recessed portico of ten Corinthian columns, a frieze and then the high clock tower, which has a concave dome and was not in the original design. The three other sides of the building are similar to the south front, except that the columns and pilasters that surround them are near to the walls, and the spaces between them have two tiers of circular-headed windows. The principal entrance is a -high archway under the south portico, which contains three highly ornamented wrought iron doors. The smaller, day-to-day entrance is to the east, facing Calverley Street. The Victoria Hall ‚Äì originally the Great Hall ‚Äì rises to inside the parallelogram of surrounding rooms and corridors and the enclosing colonnades. It is lined with marble-effect columns with gilt capitals and bases, with painted mottoes around the walls, including \\"Good Will towards Men\\", \\"Trial by Jury\\", and \\"Forward\\". The decoration was by John Crace, and, combined with the cut-glass chandeliers and the largest organ in Europe when opened, led one writer to say that it was \\"the best place in Britain to see what it looked like on the inside of a wedding cake\\". As the principal performance space, the richly decorated Victoria Hall is still a venue for orchestral concerts. The frescoes adorning the domed ceiling of the vestibule (foyer) were the first attempt to embellish a provincial edifice with high art. In the centre of the vestibule stands an -high white marble statue of Queen Victoria, by Matthew Noble, presented to the Council upon the hall's opening as the gift of the mayor Sir Peter Fairbairn. The Town Hall provided accommodation for municipal departments, a courtroom, police station, and a venue for concerts and civic events. It still has a role as a council office, though many departments have since relocated ‚Äì most are now in the Merrion House, opened 2018, and others, including a chamber for council meetings, are in the 1933 Civic Hall. =Sculpture= The building is constructed of Rawdon Hill millstone grit. As architectural master sculptors the Mawer Group produced the majority of the decorative carving. This did not include the rusticated and vermiculated base, the \\"giant\\" columns and fluted pilasters, the parapet with vases, or the basic detailing to the tower and ventilation turrets, which were the work of masons including Thomas Whiteley, who was associated with Robert Mawer. In preparation for the sculptural work, the carving areas were roughed out on the building blocks by the masons before the blocks were hoisted into place. The architectural sculptors would ascend ladders and scaffolds to carve the fine art pieces in public view. The sculptor credited for the general carving work on the building is Catherine Mawer, whose stoneyards were in Oxford Place on the east side of the building, and George Street (now Great George Street) on the north side. Her nephew William Ingle, who ran the stoneyards, carved all the sheep head reliefs, which represent the fleece. He was also responsible for the team that produced the general architectural sculpture. The tympanum above the south entrance is by the sculptor John Thomas (1813‚Äì1862). The figures represent Progress, Art and Commerce. The central figure is Athena, who has a laurel wreath, distaff, judicial chair, and owls taken from the Leeds coat of arms and from her own set of animal attributes. From left, the other four main figures are Industry with an anvil and a bale of cloth, Poetry and Music with a faun's head and a flower-swag, Fine Arts with a Corinthian capital and a bust of Minerva, and Science with a compass, globe and tools. On the west and north elevations of the building, the fourteen keystone heads were being sculpted by Catherine Mawer's husband Robert, between 1853 and 1854, when he died. Catherine Mawer completed the masks, as well as the putti on the side panels of the main entrance and on the clock tower. Repeat of the 4 Sep article. Thomas Whiteley is mentioned in credits for work. The four Portland stone lions on plinths along the frontage, an 1867 addition by the sculptor William Day Keyworth Jr, contrast with the sandstone of the building itself, and were modelled at London Zoo. History =Background= alt=A painting of a small classical building with a cupola in the middle of a shopping street Until 1813, the seat of Leeds Corporation was the Moot Hall of 1618, on Briggate, which was also used for judicial purposes. Leeds went through a period of rapid growth in the first half of the 19th century and by the mid-19th century it became apparent that the court house was no longer large enough for the functions it performed; it was demolished in 1825 and replaced by a new court house on Park Row. The neighbouring town of Bradford, the \\"wool capital of the world\\", took the lead in trying to elevate industrial Yorkshire towns with stately, grand architecture by building St George's Hall in 1851‚Äì53. It was a new status symbol, and as there was perpetual competition between Leeds and Bradford, calls grew within Leeds for its own town hall. The physician and social reformer Dr John Deakin Heaton became a major advocate and campaigner for a town hall, having visited Europe and enviously remarked on the \\"famous old cities whose Town Halls are the permanent glory of the inhabitants and the standing wonder and delight of visitors from a distance\\". His, and other supporters', belief was that \\"if a noble municipal palace that might fairly view with some of the best Town Halls of the Continent were to be erected in the middle of their hitherto squalid and unbeautiful town, it would become a practical admonition to the populace of the value of beauty and art, and in course of time men would learn to live up to it\\". In July 1850, Leeds Town Council held a public meeting, the decision of which was that a \\"large public hall\\" should be built. Emulating St George's Hall, the council proposed to sell shares in the building to the value of ¬£10 () but there was little public interest. In October, a councillor proposed introducing a specific rate levied to fund its construction instead of using a joint stock company. A decision was deferred until after the municipal election of November 1850 to give ratepayers a chance to express their views. The town hall was approved in January 1851 when the motion was put to the council and carried by twenty-four votes to twelve. The resolution read: \\"As the attempt to raise funds by public subscription has failed, it is the opinion of this Council desirable to erect a Town Hall, including suitable corporate buildings\\". The sum voted was ¬£22,000 for the building and ¬£9,500 for the land. It was intended to represent Leeds's emergence as an important industrial centre during the Industrial Revolution and symbolise civic pride and confidence. A council committee was established to assess the opinions of Leeds's inhabitants. It sent delegations to other large towns including Manchester and Liverpool to investigate their plans for building public halls. In July 1851, it presented a report, with consultees including Joseph Paxton, the designer of The Crystal Palace. The report's recommendation identified a site for the hall on what was then Park Lane (since redeveloped into the Headrow) which contained Park House and its gardens. This site was on the edge of the town centre of the time, but the project required a large parcel of land that was unavailable in the congested central streets. It was purchased from a wealthy merchant named John Blayds for the sum of ¬£9,500 (). The scheme did not secure universal backing immediately; a council motion in February 1852 proposed it was \\"unwise and inexpedient to proceed with the Hall\\". This, and other motions to limit its costs, were defeated by small majorities, but they demonstrated that financial prudence was a strong compulsion for some Victorian local politicians, who disliked incurring civic expense without genuine proof of public advantage. These happened to be in a minority in Leeds, which in the same year backed other large projects such as installing sewers for the city. Support among the public and interest groups also helped ‚Äì the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society was in strong support of the hall, as was the recently formed Leeds Improvement Society (despite its doubts on the council's competence to deliver it). Heaton, its secretary, reminded dissatisfied ratepayers throughout the decade that the Town Hall was important if the city were to discard its image of being an architectural backwater with few buildings of merit.

The brief was for a kind of building that did not yet exist in England, combining under one roof the functions of moot halls, concert rooms, and courthouses, along with municipal offices and a suite of reception rooms for the mayor. Even the monumental edifice of St George's Hall, Liverpool, only contained a public hall, a small concert hall, and assize courts. The ambitious brief also asked for space for 8,000 people, but the relatively modest budget attracted ridicule, and costs did indeed rise throughout the project. The \\"Instructions to Architects\\" made no prescription about which style the design should use, the use of the prevalent Neoclassical style being the unwritten assumption. Sir Charles Barry, at the time still occupied rebuilding the Palace of Westminster, was persuaded to advise the Town Hall Committee in their judging, which gave the competition considerable status. Premiums of ¬£200, ¬£100, and ¬£50 were awarded to the first, second and third-placed entrants. Only sixteen entries were received, which was fewer than expected, perhaps due to combination of the small prize amounts and the Council's non-commitment to employing the winning architect. Entries were anonymised and entered under noms de plume for impartiality. A design entered under the name \\"Honor alit Artes\\" was recommended by Charles Barry, and the contract was revealed to have been won by Cuthbert Brodrick, a young architect from Hull who was unknown outside his home town. He had travelled extensively in Europe in 1844-5 and acquired a love for its classical architecture. He was only twenty-nine when he won the competition for the Town Hall, but later designed some of Victorian Leeds's noted landmarks ‚Äì the Corn Exchange, Mechanics' Institute and Cookridge Street Swimming Baths. Second place in the competition was given to the partners Henry Francis Lockwood (under whom Brodrick had trained) and William Mawson, who had designed St George's Hall, Bradford in 1849, and later went on to build Bradford City Hall from 1869. The major elements of Brodrick's design used a distinctly Roman style, quite different from any of the others submitted, which used a strong entrance colonnade and rectangular plan, and took inspiration from French buildings of recent decades. Barry may have been attracted to its rationality, order, and logic. His first design included recesses on its east and west sides, but this was soon updated with extra offices, resulting in a commanding rectangular mass. The Town Hall Committee initially had reservations after selecting Brodrick, mostly relating to his youth, and asked Barry for confirmation of Brodrick's abilities in the construction of such a large building; Barry responded with high praise: that he was \\"fully satisfied that the Council might trust [Brodrick] with the most perfect safety\\", and that \\"a building constructed according to these plans would be the most perfect gem out of London\\". Unlike most assessors, Barry continued to show an interest in Brodrick and the progress of the Town Hall under construction. Next, the Committee took the unusual step of insisting in a clause in Brodrick's contract stating that he would receive no payment beyond that of the accepted estimate of ¬£39,000 if the work costs exceeded it. Brodrick agreed to this clause, with the qualification that it would not apply if costs increased for reasons beyond his control, and a sub-committee was formed to \\"superintend the progress of the works\\". No public building so large had been erected in the town before. It has almost as large a footprint as the Temple Works flax mill in Holbeck (1840). Brodrick was also interested in bold new techniques. The roof of the Victoria Hall uses an innovative system of laminated wooden beams, held by wrought-iron bolts, with a span. This is thought to be the first example in wood, taken from the roof designs of Paxton's Crystal Palace and Lewis Cubitt's King's Cross train shed, both also constructed in the 1850s. =Construction= Building works alt=An old document for the \\"ceremony of laying the foundation stone for the New Town Hall\\", with a list of attendees On 25 July 1853, the building contract was awarded to Samuel Atack, a Leeds builder and bricklayer, and Benjamin Musgrave, a dyer. It was for ¬£41,835 and included a completion target of 1 January 1856; both elements eventually turned out to have been greatly underestimated. The building is mostly of local Yorkshire stone, but the problems of finding enough large blocks of sufficient quality meant using millstone grit from 17 different quarries, which led to worries about whether the colour would match. Rawdon Hill stone was favoured for those parts of the building on which there would be carving; Derbyshire gritstone formed many of the columns. The foundation stone was laid on 17 August 1853, by the mayor, John Hope Shaw. Sizeable crowds were present at the ceremony, in which the Mayor placed into the stone's cavity some items of the era to form a time capsule, including coins and newspapers, and laid mortar on the stone with a silver trowel (on public display at Leeds City Museum). Subsequent speeches were followed by a long procession consisting of brass bands, Brodrick, magistrates, members of the council, and others. Celebrations continued with a civic banquet, festivities on Woodhouse Moor, and fireworks. During the works, Brodrick is reported as being \\"determined to see the scheme through 'whatever the cost'\\". Extracts from the log-book of the Clerk of Works, James Donaldson, surviving at West Yorkshire Archive Service, reveal Brodrick's insistence on the highest quality of work. Recurrent complaints include slow progress, poor workmanship, poor quality of stone, and insufficient through stones; Atack and Musgrave were more used to building mills than fine, large-scale public buildings. A January 1854 note from the diary records that Musgrave \\"objected to the dressing of so much of the face of the rubble walling generally and the expensive manner in which [he was] required to execute the wall\\". In March 1855 \\"Mr Brodrick was so dissatisfied with the Rawdon Hill stone being used that he took a hammer and destroyed a cornice stone to prevent it being used\\". Various other problems beset the project, which faced deadline pressures arising from Queen Victoria's agreement to open the building. Atack fell out with Brodrick early in the construction due to Brodrick's constant redesigning of details and disputes about work not being up to his specifications. Army recruitment for the Crimean War, which began in October 1853, caused a shortage of workmen and a rise in wages. Due to this and it being a period of full employment, the labour force fluctuated throughout the Town Hall's construction, slowing it, much to the architect's and Town Hall Committee's frustration. These problems ultimately led to Atack's bankruptcy in March 1857; several other local contractors were appointed to complete the project. alt=Two internal pillar tops and a relief of the city arms, featuring owls Whatever the council's doubts in the early days, it now appeared determined that nothing was too good for their Town Hall. They provided finance on an unprecedented scale, for mayor's reception rooms described by the historian Derek Linstrum as \\"splendidly furnished\\", portraits of William Wilberforce and Charles James Fox, and a marble medallion of Napoleon III and Eug√©nie. Brodrick participated in all the details of decoration in the public rooms, which each had their own character, though the richest effects were reserved for the Council Chamber in the southeast corner (now known as the Albert Room), which, in addition to the coupled fluted pilasters and ornamented frieze, has an elaborate ceiling incorporating delicately painted glass panels. Though Brodrick's red Morocco upholstered furnishings and the original gallery were removed in the 1930s, the room is a characteristic example of a Classical form of decoration which evidently appealed to Brodrick. Unique variations to the decorative capitals of the interior were devised by Brodrick to express the town's history, including such motifs from the coat of arms of Leeds as pairs of owls, and the ram's head, symbolising the golden fleece on which the prosperity of Leeds was based. The dominant criticism during the hall's construction was its cost ‚Äì the council originally granted ¬£39,000 for construction (increased from the 1851 grant of ¬£22,000), but Atak's contract was for a sum of ¬£41,835, a cost increase caused by rising prices of labour and materials. The total cost, after all structural and decoration contracts, is estimated to be around ¬£125,000 (about ¬£ million in ) ‚Äì and the council had to find extra funding at a time when there was great poverty among Leeds's working classes. Design revisions There were many design revisions during the construction, such as the inclusion of an organ, which came to be regarded as the crowning glory; town halls elsewhere followed suit. Another example is the ventilation turrets (now considered part of its character but which caused alarm when they first appeared) and the vases on the roof parapet, which Brodrick only requested the extra money for from the council after trial ornaments had been ordered. Brodrick never shied from asking for additional sums to perfect his building, so was fortunate for there to be a council majority for building to the highest standards. The most controversial modification was the inclusion of the tower. A precedent existed for them on public buildings at Liverpool Town Hall and the Royal Exchange, London. A design of a tower by Brodrick, to cost ¬£6,000, was rejected in February 1853, but it was debated at great length and the proposal resurfaced in September 1854 with a cost limitation of ¬£7,000, but this was again defeated by the Council. Opponents of the tower used the argument that \\"a tower would cost money and would only be good to look at, not to use\\". Proponents, led again by Dr John Deakin Heaton, wrote about the Continental associations of a grand and impressive town hall. He hoped that visitors would come to Leeds to see the Town Hall, and that a tower, at a few additional thousand pounds, would provide the building with beauty beyond \\"mere utilitarianism\\". The following February, a compromise was reached when the Council voted to allow \\"a form of roof construction which might eventually permit the erection of a tower \\"if at any time it should be thought desirable to do so\\". It was not until March 1856 that a tower (for ¬£5,500) was formally approved by a majority of nineteen. It would take the form of a cupola supported on columns akin to the Corinthian columns of the south facade. It is likely that Brodrick designed a tower before building even started, as suggested by such facts as its support from influential lobbyists from the outset, and the foundation walls being enlarged prematurely so that one could be added. Charles Barry too had suggested a cupola or small tower in early stages, to divert attention from an arched glazed roof which showed above the parapet. A firm named Addy and Nicholls was appointed contractors for the tower and interior work. The tower was not completed until after the Town Hall's official opening, with a bell cast by John Warner & Sons hung in 1860, closely followed by the clock mechanism, installed by Dent of London (the dials designed by Edmund Beckett Denison, installed by Potts) one storey above the bell. The grand entrance hall originally envisaged, with a screen of columns leading to the great hall, had to be abandoned in favour of a cramped vestibule to support the tower above, but this was considered a worthy price for the extra drama and power a tower would provide. The film-maker Jonathan Meades reflected that the \\"symbolic, representative function of Leeds Town Hall increased during the period of its gestation and construction. In Brodrick‚Äôs earlier scheme, the only thing that rose above its uninflected parapet was a low storey reminiscent of a theatre‚Äôs fly tower in the centre. A magnificently sullen, passive building was transformed into a magnificently sullen, aggressive one, at the behest of the hall's promoters\\". Later changes alt=A crane lifts a large statue into the air. Further modifications to the Town Hall continued to be made after its opening, beginning with the entrance steps being changed in part to semi-circular in the 1860s, Brodrick suggesting in 1867 that a larger skylight be put in each of the courts, and then, later in the same year, the placing of the four sculpted lions along the south front. Brodrick's final touches to the Town Hall, the lions are the work of William Day Keyworth Jr of Hull, and each is made from two pieces of Portland stone with zig-zag joints. Evidence of Brodrick's early interest in lion sculptures is documented in travel sketches from his European tour, at San Lorenzo Cathedral and the Palazzo dell'Universit√† in Genoa, and the monument to Clement XIII in St Peter's, Rome. Inside the Victoria Hall, a gallery was added in 1874 and then replaced in 1890 by the current design by W. H. Thorp; there was also an 1894 redecoration of the Victoria Hall by John Dibblee Crace in a buff and white colour scheme, replacing his father J G Crace's 1857 green colours. In 1905, a memorial to Queen Victoria by George Frampton was unveiled in Victoria Square to the south front, replacing a fountain, while the number of windows on the Calverley Street and Victoria Square corner was increased from three to five. In 1907, a new grand stair was built down to the basement. During the 1930s, original fittings, including a gallery designed by Brodrick, were lost in an enlargement of the classical Council Chamber. Victoria Square was altered again in 1937 with the removal of three statues, of Victoria, Robert Peel, and the Duke of Wellington, to Woodhouse Moor one mile from the city centre. At the same time the curved entrance steps were changed back to a straight set. =Opening= Victoria Arch, alt=An arch with columns and a pediment standing alone in a woodland Despite the cost overrunning more than threefold, Leeds Town Council considered the Town Hall a great investment and celebrated its new centrepiece. Arrangements for the Town Hall's opening were made well in advance. On 6 September 1858, the Queen arrived at Leeds Central railway station, met by crowds estimated to number 400,000 to 600,000. The Council had even established a sub-committee for street decorations ‚Äì flags, banners and streamers lined the streets of the city. She stayed the night at Woodsley House on Clarendon Road, the home of the Mayor, Peter Fairbairn, with tight military security. The day was combined with an exhibition of local manufactures, held in the Cloth Hall, and a music festival, which opened with Mendelson's Elijah and closed with Handel's Messiah. Leeds City Police were reinforced with officers from the West Riding, Bradford, London and Birmingham. Local reporters delightedly proclaimed that on that day, as the head of the Empire was in Leeds, the town was briefly her capital. The building was officially opened on 7 September by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, though the tower was still incomplete. Vast crowds turned out to watch the royal procession, including 32,000 schoolchildren assembled on Woodhouse Moor. She proceeded from the Mayor's home down Woodhouse Lane to the city centre and back up to the top of East Parade where a temporary triumphal arch had been constructed to frame the building. The route had been carefully planned so Victoria and Albert could see much of the town without glimpsing the new Town Hall. With a red carpet and military band on the steps, they entered the building, she knighted the Mayor, and then the hall was declared open on her behalf by the Prime Minister, the Earl of Derby. Later, the Queen was escorted to Wellington station to travel north to Balmoral. On 22 September 1858, only a fortnight after the opening of the Town Hall, the British Association for the Advancement of Science held its annual meeting in Leeds. For many years Leeds had wanted to host a meeting of the British Association, and the building of a large hall made this possible. Since then many meetings, conferences, and exhibitions have been held in the Town Hall. In the 19th century, some major trials were held here, including those of Charles Peace in 1879, and Kate Dover in 1882. The Town Hall and entirely new Victoria Square, built on the site of a single house and garden, and which when completed was completely outsize for what was a residential area, effectively altered the balance of the whole town and led to a great development northwards and westwards from City Square, the former centre. =20th century= alt=B&W; photograph of a scaffolding-covered Town Hall undergoing cleaning alt=A police cell, with white walls, stone floor and a bench Leeds Civic Hall, on a nearby site further up Calverley Street, was commissioned in 1929 in a Keynesian project intended to provide work for the local unemployed. The Civic Hall opened in 1933 as the seat of Leeds City Council; the Council Chamber of the Town Hall was converted to a courtroom. On 14 and 15 March 1941, Leeds was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Houses were destroyed in inner-city districts and bombs dropped on the city centre, hitting the east side of the Town Hall, causing significant damage to its roof and walls on Calverley Street. The damage was repaired shortly after, but evidence still remains in Victoria Gardens. For the duration of World War II, the Town Hall crypt housed an ARP post and from 1942 a British Restaurant, where people could enjoy cheap, hot food, which proved popular after the war, being refurbished in 1960 before closing in 1966. In 1951, the Town Hall was designated a Grade I listed building, a status applied to a building of exceptional architectural or historic interest, and which offers statutory protection against unauthorised demolition or modification. A fire damaged the courtroom in 1991. In 1993, Leeds Crown Court opened on Westgate, ending the Town Hall's role as a courthouse; its police station and cells (Bridewell) were closed at the same time. During its time as Leeds Assizes and later the Crown Court, the Town Hall held various notable cases, including the conviction and life-sentencing of Stefan Kiszko for the murder of Lesley Molseed in 1976 (later quashed) and the conviction of Zsiga Pankotia for the murder of Jack Eli Myers in 1961. Pankotia became the last man to be hanged at Armley Gaol. For much of the 20th century, the Town Hall was left blackened by soot and smoke from the industrial city surrounding it. In spring 1972 the building was given its first official clean-up ‚Äì on previous occasions it had been hosed down by the fire brigade ‚Äì which revealed much of the detailed stonework. This was strongly opposed by the Leeds Civic Trust, which preferred that its blackness \\"should stand as a symbol of the city's industrial past and as a reminder to future generations of the air pollution which the city is so successfully combatting\\". =21st century= A major refurbishment project of the whole building commenced in 2019, funded by Leeds City Council's capital fund, with a public campaign funding some interior renovation costs. The three-year works will provide new seating and soundproofing, new bars and public event spaces in previously blocked-off rooms, comprehensive interior redecoration, modifications to two chandeliers to use dimmable LEDS, relocation of the box office to the ground level. The Scottish firm Page\\\\Park Architects is responsible for all scheme designs. Works are also taking place to the clock tower and roof, including replacement of all tiles with Welsh slate; the roof project is being designed and managed by NPS Group. As part of the roof works, contractors discovered on the dome a plaque dated 1861 placed by the last men to work on it. The plaque reads: \\"This dome was stripped and old lead put on after by Herbert Westcombe and Joseph Nett\\". The building is scheduled to reopen in 2022 in time for the Leeds 2023 city-wide cultural festival. In 2019, a time capsule was installed in the clock tower, assembled by a group of young people working with Leeds Museums and Galleries. The capsule contains items such as a Nando's menu, nine Lego minifigures, a mobile phone, Leeds Owl artwork and a Refugee Education Training Advice Service cookery book donated by a woman who moved from Syria to Leeds in 2018. Present usage alt=Clock tower, turret and roof of the Town Hall Despite its original purpose as the seat of local government in Leeds being taken over by subsequent council buildings, the Town Hall retains an active role in the civic and cultural life of the city. Conferences, weddings, and civil partnerships take place in the Albert Room and the Brodrick Suite, which have been converted from the former courtroom and Council Chamber and are home to a register office. The opulent Victoria Hall is a venue for many performances ‚Äì its 6,600-pipe organ is still the largest three-manual example in Europe ‚Äì regular lunchtime organ recitals are given by City Organist Simon Lindley and others, while a full programme of music, comedy, and exhibitions uses this main space year-round. Several recurring cultural events use the Town Hall such as Leeds International Concert Season, the triennial Leeds International Piano Competition, and the Leeds International Film Festival. Other events include Leeds International Beer Festival, a four-day annual festival celebrating and promoting craft beer. The Town Hall is as a landmark and heritage asset; guided tours of the building, visiting areas not usually open to the public, are occasionally given. Remaining historic features include the old borough courtroom, which has wooden benches and stairs leading down from the dock into the basement ‚Äì now a storage area but was originally the bridewell (prison cells), located under the front steps. Also accessible only on the tours is the clock tower, entered via 203 spiral steps and which houses the original Potts & Sons quarter-chiming, four faced clock. Leeds Town Hall has been used as a location for several films and television programmes, supported by Screen Yorkshire. It was used in the opening scenes of the 2016 film Dad's Army while The New Statesman, Peaky Blinders, Residue, National Treasure, and The ABC Murders TV series are among productions which have used interior and exterior shots. Appraisal Much has been written about the building's importance as a heritage asset for the City of Leeds and the nation. Representing an evolution in the civic growth of Leeds from a market town to a major city, the Town Hall is the legacy of the citizens and leaders of its time who managed to express Leeds's increasing wealth and importance. Its tower, often used as a symbol of Leeds, was described by Colin Cunningham, an academic, as \\"a remarkably assured and individualistic design which has no obvious precedents\\", and is the subject of a protected view in local planning policy, ensuring no new tall buildings will block the long-range views of it across the western side of the city centre. Leeds Town Hall has been used as a model for civic buildings across Britain and the British Empire, being one of the largest and earliest. In particular, Bolton Town Hall in Greater Manchester (1873) and Portsmouth Guildhall in Hampshire (1890), both works by the Leeds architect and Brodrick student William Hill (1827‚Äì1889), take many of their design cues from Leeds Town Hall. Another significant appropriation of its form ‚Äì the square plan with a neoclassical design and tower ‚Äì is Parliament House, Melbourne (1856), as are other colonial examples such as Parliament House, Adelaide (1880s), and in South Africa, Cape Town City Hall (1893) and Durban City Hall (1885). Additionally, many Americans reportedly travelled to Leeds especially to see the Town Hall after its opening, which some venerated as highly as medieval cathedrals. The composition of a building with end pavilions and a dominating central tower was adopted for example at Philadelphia City Hall (John McArthur Jr., 1871‚Äì1901), which has struck architectural historians as the ultimate expansion of Brodrick's idea of a domed tower, crowned with a great statue of William Penn, while the first design for the New York State Capitol followed a similar layout and a tower which featured a close resemblance to Leeds Town Hall's. In 1857, prior to opening, the following remarks on Leeds Town Hall were made by two Liverpool architects at a meeting of the Liverpool Architectural and Archaeological Society: About a century after its opening, the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote: \\"Leeds can be proud of its town hall, one of the most convincing buildings of its date in the country and of the classical buildings of its date no doubt the most successful.\\" Pevsner was more hesitant to praise the tower, writing \\"the architect has not quite made up his mind whether he wanted a dome like those of the Greenwich Hospital or a tower\\". In a never- broadcast 1960s BBC film about the changing architecture of Leeds, the poet John Betjeman, known for his love of Victorian architecture, praised the town hall. A 2007 BBC programme presented by Jonathan Meades profiled Cuthbert Brodrick and appraised the architecture of Leeds Town Hall. Meades said In November 2008, Leeds Town Hall and the town halls of Halifax, Paisley, Burslem, Hornsey, Manchester, Lynton, Dunfermline, Fordwich and Much Wenlock were selected as the \\"ten town halls to visit\\" by Architecture Today. It commented: \\"The epitome of northern civic bombast, Leeds' municipal palace has a grandeur that helps sustain the city's sense of its own importance. Its architect, Cuthbert Brodrick, also contributed the Corn Exchange and City Museum before disappearing into obscurity\\".

After returning to England, he served as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham East from 1906 to January 1910. Early life Cotton was born in 1845 in the city of Kumbakonam in the Madras region of India, to Indian- born parents of English descent, Joseph John Cotton (1813-1867) and Susan Jessie Minchin (1823-1888). Through his paternal great-grandfather Joseph Cotton (1746‚Äì1825), Henry John Stedman Cotton was a first cousin once removed of both the judge Henry Cotton (his godfather, who he was named after) and of the African explorer William Cotton Oswell. The British man of letters James S. Cotton was his brother. In 1848, he left India to be educated in England. He entered Magdalen College School in 1856, Brighton College in 1859, and King's College London in 1861. After his graduation from college, he took and passed the Indian Civil Service Examination. Career Cotton joined the Indian Civil Service, arriving in India in 1867. His first posting was at Midnapore, where his immediate superior was William James Herschel, then the local magistrate. His eldest son H. E. A. Cotton was born in that city in 1868. He later served in Chuadanga, where he witnessed the great flood of 1871. In 1872 he was posted to Calcutta, and in 1873 he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Bengal Government by Sir George Campbell, and later worked under Sir Richard Temple. In 1878 he became magistrate and collector at Chittagong; in 1880 he became Senior Secretary to the Board of Revenue in Bengal. He later became Revenue Secretary to Government, Financial and Municipal Secretary, and then a member of the Bengal Legislative Council. Cotton eventually rose to be Chief Commissioner of Assam (1896 to 1902), during which time he experienced the 1897 Assam earthquake. The Viceroy, Lord Curzon, visited Assam in March 1900, and in an address afterwards praised Cotton's ‚Ä≥effort and interest in the province‚Ä≥, but was otherways unusually careful not to promise much in his speeches during the visit. Cotton College, Guwahati was established in 1901 by Cotton. As he retired, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902. Cotton supported Indian Home Rule and got into serious trouble when he advocated the cause in his 1885 book New India, or India in Transition (revised edition 1907). In 1904, he served as President of the Indian National Congress, one of the few non-Indians to do so. As such, he led the opposition to Lord Curzon's invasion of Tibet and partition of Bengal. On his return to England, Cotton was elected Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham East in 1906. There he formed a radical pro-Indian parliamentary group, and criticised his own government's actions in India. Already in poor health, he was narrowly defeated in his attempt for re-election in 1910. Personal life Mary, Lady Cotton (n√©e Ryan), photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron. In 1867 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, Cotton married Mary Ryan (1848-1914). They had four children: Sir Harry Evan Auguste Cotton (1868-1939), Julian James Cotton (1869-1927), Mary Cotton (b. 1873), and Albert Louis Cotton (1874-1936). Cotton met and married Ryan having seen a picture of her taken by pioneering photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Ryan had been partly raised by Cameron, who found her as a child begging on Putney Heath. The couple were photographed together by Cameron, in costume as Romeo and Juliet, on their wedding day. Two of his sons, H.E.A. Cotton and Julian James, also made careers in the civil service in India. Cotton's grandson, Sir John Cotton (1909-2002), was Ambassador to the Congo Republic and Burundi and the last of six generations of Cottons to serve in colonial administration in India. He was an active writer and activist on behalf of Indian rights until the end of his life, despite ill health and financial difficulties. In 1911 he published his memoirs, Indian and Home Memories. Sir Henry Cotton died at his home in St John's Wood, London, in October 1915.

Background In 1929, the Royal Air Force needed urgent replacements of the Supermarine Southampton IIs then operated by No. 203 Squadron RAF based at Basra, Iraq. The Air Ministry issued Specification S.18/29 to specifically cover the procurement of a military variant of the Short S.8 Calcutta, similar to the S.8/2 Calcutta then being designed in collaboration with Breguet for Aviation Navale (French Naval Aviation). The new RAF version had Shorts designation S.8/8 and RAF designation Rangoon, and three examples were initially ordered. Design and development The Rangoon was a straightforward military adaption of the Calcutta. The main structure was assembled from duralumin formers, spars, ribs and stringers; the fuselage was skinned with duralumin, and the flying surfaces were partly skinned and partly fabric-covered. The major changes were the provision of an enclosed cockpit for the pilots, rest bunks, enlarged fuel tanks in the upper wing, three Lewis guns (one mounted forward of the cockpit, and two in the fuselage behind the wings), underwing bomb racks, and a large fresh water tank (for intended use in tropical conditions). Operational history The lead aircraft of three Rangoons over Brisbane River, 1934 On 24 September 1930, the first Rangoon (S1433) was flown from the River Medway at Rochester by Shorts' Chief Test Pilot, John Lankester Parker. In early 1931, the first three Rangoons were delivered to the RAF for training at Felixstowe, then in April 1931 they were flown in formation to No. 203 Squadron RAF at Basra.RAF timeline: Rangoon entered RAF service in April 1931 They were used for surveying and anti- smuggling patrols over Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Over the following three years, three more Rangoons (built to a higher specification R.19/31) were delivered to No. 203 Squadron at Basra, where they served without problem until 1935, when they were replaced by Short Singapore IIIs. In September and October 1934, three Rangoons of No. 203 Squadron visited Australia as part of the celebrations of the centenary of the state of Victoria and of the centenary of Melbourne.Rangoons in Melbourne 1934 In August 1935, five Rangoons were transferred to No. 210 Squadron RAF at Pembroke Dock. In September 1935, they were temporarily deployed to Gibraltar during the Abyssinia Crisis, and all were retired from service at the end of 1935. Meanwhile, the first Rangoon (S1433) was stripped of military equipment by Shorts at Rochester, registered G-AEIM, then used by Air Pilots Training Ltd for training crews of Imperial Airways at Hamble, until it was retired in late 1938.

In the Tashelhit Berber oral tradition, he is also known as Bab n Umareg, \\"the Master of Poetry\\", and a great number of poems still recited today are ascribed to him. About his life nothing is known with certainty. Names The poet is known by various names.Listed and explained by Amarir (1987:11-12). See also Stumme (1895:34-35). He is most commonly known simply as Sidi ·∏§emmu, this being the name used in the oral tradition as well as in printed publications (also spelled Sidi Hammo, Sidi Hammou). Sidi \\"my Lord\\" is an honorary title borrowed from Arabic.The Classical Arabic form of the title is sayyidƒ´. ·∏§ammu is a colloquial variant of Mu·∏•ammad current among speakers of Shilha. He is also known as ·∏§ammu Gg ∑zgruz (or, in Arabic: Mu·∏•ammad al-Zagr≈´zƒ´) \\"·∏§ammu of Azegrouz\\", after the name of the subtribe to which he belonged (see below). In Shilha, his nickname is Bab n Umarg \\"Master of Poetry\\".E.

The poet is also sometimes called Sidi ·∏§ammu al-·π¨ƒÅlib \\"Sidi ·∏§ammu the Scholar\\". According to Johnston, \\"it is highly improbable that Sidi Hammo ever read a book, save some necessary portions of the Koran. Among the highlanders of the great range, a little learning goes a long way, and the man who can decipher the chapter of the day easily passes for a sage\\".Johnston (1907b:17). However, Amarir explains that in order to earn the Arabic title ·π≠ƒÅlib, literally \\"seeker (of knowledge)\\", one must not only have memorized the entire text of the Qur'an, being able to recite it at will, but one must also have some grounding in \\"the sciences\\" (i.e., Arabic grammar, exegesis of the Qur'an, Islamic law, etc.) and evince a good understanding of what has been learned.Amarir (1987:20) Hence, Sidi ·∏§ammu \\"the Scholar\\" may have had more learning than Johnston allowed. Life Sidi ·∏§ammu's dates are not known with any certainty. AmarirAmarir (1987:13-15). discusses the various proposals made earlier by Stumme and Johnston, and concludes that the poet most probably flourished in the second half of the 18th century. Johnston suggests that Sidi ·∏§ammu was \\"probably a native of Aoulouz on the southern slope of the Atlas Mountains\\".Johnstone (1907b:10). Amarir, who actually visited the poet's native area in 1980, found out that Sidi ·∏§ammu was born some distance to the northwest of Aoulouz, in the village of Tarhouggalt (Ta…£gg ∑alt),In his acknowledgments, Amarir expresses his gratitude to the men who transported him to the village \\"on their mules\\" ( øal√° bighƒÅlihim). and that this village belonged to the tribe of Azegrouz (Azgruz).Azegrouz is a small tribe (Amarir calls it a mujm≈´ øat madƒÅshir \\"cluster of villages\\") which is part of the Tifnout tribe (juz æ min al-qabƒ´lah al-kabƒ´rah Tƒ´fn≈´t). See Amarir (1987:12). About his death, Johnston records that Sidi ·∏§ammu \\"In all probability died in the Iskrouzen district among his well-beloved mountains. His shrine stands there to-day, and is a well-known place of pilgrimage\\".Johnstone (1907b:10) Internet sources do not contain any reference to a place or district in Morocco called Iskrouzen. Amarir states that according to his sources, Sidi ·∏§ammu is buried in or near the tomb of MawlƒÅy IbrƒÅhƒ´m ibn A·∏•mad al-AmghƒÅrƒ´, a Sufi saint who died in 1661 CE, in the town of Moulay Brahim which is named after him.Amarir (1987:12, 14). No detail of Sidi ·∏§ammu's life are known, except that he was an itinerant poet and singer (Shilha an·∏ç·∏çam).Galand-Pernet (1972:171), \\"an·∏ç·∏çam, le po√®te (cr√©ateur)\\". The Shilha term is derived from the Arabic root n-√∞Ã£-m \\"to compose (a poem), to render in poetry\\". Both Stumme and Johnston report, on the basis of oral sources, that Sidi ·∏§ammu was of dark complexion.Stumme (1895:9) \\"S√Ædi ·∏§√°mmu, der nach der Ansicht ser Schlu·∏• ein Neger - oder wenigstens sehr dunkelfarbig - gewesen sein soll\\"; Johnson (1907b:8), \\"Some hold he was a man of very dark complexion, that is to say of negro blood on one side\\".

It was first published in 1927 by Gustav Fischer Verlag in Jena and defending classical liberal ideology based on individual property rights. Starting from the principle of private property, Mises shows how the other classical liberal freedoms follow from property rights and argues that liberalism free of government intervention is required to promote peace, social harmony and the general welfare. The book was translated into English by a student of Mises, Ralph Raico, but its first English edition in 1962 was titled The Free and Prosperous Commonwealth rather than Liberalism, as Mises thought that the literal translation would create confusion because the term liberalism after the New Deal and especially in the 1960s became widely used in the United States to refer to a centre-left politics that supports degrees of government intervention, in opposition to Mises' central premise. The English translation was made available online by the Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2000. Publication history =In German= *Ludwig von Mises, Liberalismus.

Its collection also includes 19th-century and earlier art works. It is a grade II listed building owned and administered by Leeds City Council, linked on the West to Leeds Central Library and on the East via a bridge to the Henry Moore Institute with which it shares some sculptures. A Henry Moore sculpture, Reclining Woman: Elbow (1981), stands in front of the entrance. The entrance hall contains Leeds' oldest civic sculpture, a 1712 marble statue of Queen Anne. In front of the gallery is Victoria Square, at the eastern end of which is the city's war memorial. This square is often used for rallies and demonstrations because of the speakers' dais provided by the raised entrance to the gallery. History Opening of Leeds City Art Gallery in 1888 from the Illustrated London News The original concept of this gallery was initiated by an executive committee formed in 1876 for the purpose, by Leeds Fine Art Society. The original committee included its president, the Marquis of Ripon, Hon. Sec. John Joseph Willson, Rev. John Gott (vicar of Leeds, and son of Benjamin Gott), John Atkinson Grimshaw, and architect W.H. Thorp. The gallery was built between 1886‚Äì88 by W. H. Thorp, as an extension to the Municipal Buildings to the west (built 1878‚Äì84 by George Corson, now housing Leeds Central Library). It opened on 3 October 1888 as Leeds City Art Gallery and was paid for by public subscription, collected in honour of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. It was opened by the Mayor, Alderman Scarr, with the artist Hubert von Herkomer in attendance. What is now the Tiled Hall Caf√© was the sculpture gallery, having been modified from the Reading Room of the adjacent public library, to be illuminated by electric light. All other galleries were lit by daylight from rooflights. The new building had a central court of two storeys with a glass roof and a fountain of Burmatofts faience. (A floor was later put in to create additional space.) In 1912, the Leeds Art Collections Fund (now known as the Leeds Art Fund) was formed to support the gallery's acquisitions. At its centenary exhibition in 2012, it displayed the 430 works it had helped to acquire for the city. In 1982 it was modified, turning the entrance from the East side to the South, on the Headrow, with an extension for the sculpture collection. A further development was the conversion of three Victorian houses on Cookridge street to the Henry Moore Institute, which is now linked by a bridge to the gallery and contains the main sculpture collections. The new building was opened by Her Majesty the Queen on 26 November 1982. A ¬£1.5 million renovation was completed in June 2007, including opening up the magnificent Victorian Tiled Hall (used as a caf√© and bookshop) which links the gallery and the library, and the former Queen's Gallery was named after local businessman and patron of the arts, Arnold Ziff. At first floor level there is direct access from the gallery to the Art Library. The gallery includes a ground floor lecture theatre named after Henry Moore which is used for a variety of events. It closed again in January 2016 for extensive renovation, re-opening 13 October 2017. The renovation uncovered the glass roof in the Central Court Gallery, which had been covered by a false ceiling. An abstract wall painting by Lothar G√∂tz was provided to brighten up the Victorian staircase.

By definition, holders of the Chartered Financial Planner qualification are among the most experienced and most qualified advisers in the profession. As at May 2016, there were over 36,000 members of the Personal Finance Society (the principal professional body for financial advisers in the UK), of which over 5,000 hold Chartered Financial Planner status. Since 2012, financial adviser firms can apply for Corporate Chartered Financial Planners status, if they qualify under a number of criteria. Fewer than 500 firms can boast Corporate Chartered Financial Planners status. The titles of Chartered Financial Planner and Chartered Financial Planners were granted by the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII). The Privy Council authorised the CII to issue the Chartered title in 2005. Thus, a Chartered Financial Planner now carries comparable qualifications as other established professions such as Chartered Accountants and Chartered Surveyors, etc. Membership of the Personal Finance Society, the leading professional body for financial planners, is required to be able to use the professional designation Chartered Financial Planner. The individual Chartered Financial Planner qualification fits into the National Qualifications Framework at Level 6, equivalent to a Bachelor (first) Degree.  Requirements  To attain Chartered Financial Planner status as an individual, one must study for and pass approximately 14 exams in various aspects of financial services and related subjects. Each exam offered by the Chartered Insurance Institute carries a certain number of \\"credits\\" in their qualification scheme. Credits can also be granted for passing equivalent exams from other awarding bodies. A total of 290 credits is required before Chartered status can be applied for. This is likely to take several years to achieve. In addition to examinations, advisers are required to be members of the Personal Finance Society, maintain ongoing learning through a required amount of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) each year, and have a minimum of five years of relevant industry experience.  Corporate chartered status  Firms that can demonstrate the highest commitment to professional standards, development and ethics can apply for Corporate Chartered Financial Planners status. At the end of January 2017, there were fewer than 500 firms authorised to use the title.  Related designations UK  There are over 208 designations available for financial-services professionals. These are some of the more common designations: *Certified Financial Planner In the United Kingdom, the CFP designation is available to financial planners through membership of the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment (CISI). *Chartered Tax Adviser *Chartered Certified Accountant and/or Chartered Accountant *Chartered Financial Analyst  Equivalent titles abroad  In the United States, the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) qualification is more broadly comparable to the CFA's Chartered status. The MFP Master Financial Planner designation from the American Academy of Financial Management is also the graduate designation for financial planners. The MFP is a federal trademarked designation in the United States which requires accredited exams and degrees. *Certified Public Accountant *Certified Investment Management Analyst (CIMA), Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA) *Chartered Financial Consultant *Chartered Market Technician *Financial Risk Manager References External links * Chartered Insurance Institute: information on Chartered Status * DirectGov: details of National Qualifications Framework * FSA website- information about Retail Distribution Review * IFA search tool run by the CII/PFS, allowing customers to filter by Chartered Financial Planners only *Financial Times: Eight steps to choosing a financial adviser *Financial Conduct Authority: Official Website * Category:Professional certification in finance ","title":"Chartered Financial Planner"},{"id":"12275865","text":"Domingo Cisma Gonz√°lez (born 9 February 1982) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a left back, and is the manager of Mor√≥n CF.

DJ Marlboro is one of the originators of the funk carioca, which is how a crossover between freestyle and hip-hop music genres is known in Brazil. His first LP, Funk Brasil (1989), marks the beginning of the Funk Carioca Movement, initially with versions of hip-hop and freestyle hits from American artists, especially the 2 Live Crew (\\"Do Wah Diddy\\" became \\"Mel√¥ da Mulher Feia\\" and \\"One and One\\" became \\"Mel√¥ dos N√∫meros\\"), sung in Portuguese. He got the idea of making Portuguese versions of American songs by paying attention to how people at parties that played freestyle music in Rio de Janeiro, known as \\"baile funk,\\" would create and sing their own versions of the songs, in Portuguese, as they couldn't understand English, and how they would nickname the songs as \\"mel√¥ do...\\" (\\"the ... song\\"), since the original name of the songs, in English, was too difficult for them to pronounce and memorize. The best example is his first song, \\"Mel√¥ da Mulher Feia\\" (\\"song of the ugly woman\\"), which was how patrons of the \\"baile funk\\" would call the 2 Live Crew's version of \\"Do Wah Diddy,\\" as they would sing along \\"mulher feia chupa o ... e d√° o ...\\" (\\"ugly woman sucks ... and gives ...\\") to the 2 Live Crew's tune. He then made a PG version of the song and recorded it, and was a smash hit on the radio, prompting him to create more songs and record his first album. Later on, Marlboro and others started writing their own songs, and he released several albums. He used to live in a district of the Rio de Janeiro city that was very distant, nicknamed \\"Marlboro Country\\" by his peers, who started calling him \\"Marlboro,\\" and the nickname stuck. DJ Marlboro is the host and producer of the radio show \\"Big Mix in Rio\\". DJ Marlboro was introduced to a worldwide audience In 2004 when German journalist, record label owner and fellow DJ, Daniel Haaksman formed Man Recordings and recruited both DJ Marlboro and Edu-K and DJ Marlboro - creating a link between South American and European artists.(http://h0tsauce.wordpress.com/2007/06/21/its-a-mans-mans-mans-world/) DJ Marlboro credits the resurgence of funk fever in Brazil to the cyclical nature of musical fads, saying in his 23 years as a DJ, he's witnessed the funk explosion several times.Cumming, Andy. An Interview with DJ Marlboro, June 2003 Brazilian bailes, well attended dance parties that played American soul, disco, and funk music, featured heavy bass sounds and light systems. DJ Marlboro's Portuguese rapping in his 1989 LP ‚ÄúFunk Brazil‚Äù helped introduce Portuguese music into these bailes, where the heavy bass sounds became a platform for this new sound. As a result, by the mid-1990s most of the music played by funk DJs was produced in Brazil. Currently, DJ Marlboro is the resident DJ at S√£o Paulo's Lov.e Club.(http://www.gringoes.com/articles.asp?ID_Noticia=658 ) DJ Marlboro maintains that ‚Äúfunk is a way of expression that was born from the common people‚Äù. To him, funk is at its best when most people are unaware of it, preventing the exploitation of artists. DJ Marlboro expresses the importance of its underlying culture by asserting that the movement need not be glorified or globally successful. He insists that funk will always continue to be played, whether the world can hear it or not. 5 He urges listeners to understand that it is a musical movement that has sprung from culture and a passion to tell the truth; not from the need to accept and nationalize music from other parts of the world, particularly the United States. He acknowledges that recordings are not a priority for funk artists, because the point is to go the bailes and dance.Brazilian Wax: The New Yorker DJ Marlboro embraces and supports the \\"undergroundness\\" of the Baile Funk scene, particularly the music played at the Bailes in Brazil. In an interview, DJ Marlboro says, \\"The bailes in Rio have survived such a long time because we do the bailes to please the public. We work with music that doesn't need to recognised or be successful in the rest of the world. We play tracks that are popular in the bailes full stop. We don't need media and marketing.\\" He embraces the aspect of funk and certain artists being unknown because that keeps this genre alive in the streets, despite the resistance from the media and upperclass culture. The resistance from the upperclass and police stems from the upper class considering this music to be strictly pornographic, offensive, and sexually explicit. DJ Marlboro is a main public face trying to reverse that opinion and have the people look deeper into the true origins and messages of the music.¬™¬™Hyperdub¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨Softwar As stated in an interview with DJ Marlboro in 2003, \\"Chuck D refers to rap as the black CNN. In many respects Rio or baile funk could be referred to as favela CNN. That is, it's used as a medium to convey how the people who live in the Brazilian favelas really feel using their own language, idioms and slang.\\" This helps empower these artists, and while they may not gain national acclaim, they get the respect of their fans for delivering both a real sound and message. This is also seen through the lack of major record deals in the world of funk music. He knows first hand the hardships of being a funk artist, in a separate interview he says, \\"We suffer a lot of persecution. At one recent baile, the police came in and shut it down... My sound systems have bullet holes in them from police attacks.‚Äù DJ Marlboro has transcended this situation, however, as he has now become international and has teamed up with recognized artists such as M.I.A..Bucky Done Gun [DJ Marlboro Funk Carioca Remix] Lyrics  M.I.A. MTV Through these various collaborations, DJ Marlboro has played a significant role in increasing the popularity of funk carioca not only within Brazil, but at the global level as well. In fact, he has been one of the main players in taking funk abroad, playing shows throughout Europe (Britain, Germany, France), The United States, and even China.Cumming, Andy. \\"Who Let the Yobs Out?\\" Stylus Magazine, 21 November 2005. Marlboro's sets have been in demand in some of the major electronic festivals in the world, festivals such as Sonar in Spain, Brasil 40 Degrees in London, Summer Stage Central Park in New York, Tim Festival in Rio, Sonarsound in S√£o Paulo and Elektronika in Belo Horizonte.DJ Marlboro‚Äôs Biography ‚Äì Last.fm According to an interview with DJ Marlboro in 2003, \\"DJ Marlboro believes in which keeping funk discreet to the public, may reduce the amount of exploitation within the genre. \\"The best time for funk is when people don't know about it, for those of us who are funkateers that is\\". In relation to the exploitation of Funk, he mentioned that people view funk as \\"an image of women with big butts, you never see the many sides to funk, so people look and they think that funk is pornographic, funk is violent... but funk is all of this, it's violent, romantic, and playful.\\" He embraces the baile funk scene in Rio, because he enjoys pleasing the public. It is assumed that individuals that are new to Funk genre just assume that Baile Funk is just associated with pornographic notions. According to an article on Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty beats, \\"Baile funk is nothing like that. This is raw, bare-bones, hooky but proudly unmelodic stuff, recorded on the cheap with 808 drum machines, early samplers, and dusty computers. Rio Baile Funk soundsand feels, reallylike a revelation\\". Accusation of Pedophilia In 2009 DJ Marlboro was under investigation on account of pedophilia. There was a criminal investigation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in which DJ Marlboro was suspected of sexually abusing a four-year-old girl. After the investigation he was not charged with any crimes.CPI da Pedofilia convoca DJ Marlboro para depoimento References Category:Brazilian DJs Category:Funk carioca musicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Orquestra Imperial members ","title":"DJ Marlboro"},{"id":"12275885","text":"Icelandic weddings today still observe some traditional customs, such as seating by gender and the high table. In Iceland co-habitation of a couple without a formal wedding has not carried as much stigma as elsewhere. It is not uncommon for people to marry after having been in a relationship together for years, even decades. Older traditions Wedding feasts would commence over a number of days, depending on the status and wealth of the respective families. In the Icelandic Sagas the weddings are important functions where deals, friends and enemies are made. Modern weddings = The ceremony = Modern weddings usually consist of a 30-45 minute ceremony, generally held in a church but outdoor weddings have gained popularity and can be held where a suitable location is found. Offices of magistrates generally have very little room for guests but some do perform the ceremony at a location of the couples choosing. The invitations are usually sent by the couple themselves but it is also customary for the parents of the couple to send out a joint invitation. Traditionally men sit on the grooms side while women sit on the brides side. The father of the groom joins his son at the altar and they greet everyone who enters with a curt bow. The mothers greet the visitors as they enter the church itself in the foyer. Once the mothers take their seats the guests know that the bride has arrived, she is led by her father to the altar where they take their seats on the brides side. 3-5 songs are performed by artists (possibly a choir) during the ceremony. Once the rings have been drawn upon the fingers and the couple declared man and wife, the bride returns to her seat and the groom and the father of the bride change their seats. Once the ceremony is over the couple make their way up the aisle, followed by their fathers who take their own wives in hand from the front pew. The guests then file out in seating order, with those at the front filing out first and then the next row and so on, couples usually walking hand in hand. Immediately after the ceremony the bride and groom usually go away for an hour or so for a photosession. In the meantime the invited guests make their way to the location of the reception and place their gifts on a designated table. The gifts are not opened until the next day. Receptions are commonly an all- evening affair with food, music and dance but alternatively the reception can be a much shorter one with coffee and cake offerings. = The reception = Once the newlyweds arrive an honorary toast is made before dinner commences. Immediately after dinner a couple of speeches are held. The bride and groom jointly cut the wedding cake (usually a multi-tier). Once cake and coffee have been served the newlyweds dance the first dance together, traditionally a bridal waltz. After the first dance they are joined by their parents and next of kin and then other guests on the dancefloor. The bride tosses her bouquet over her shoulder to the assembled unmarried women; the woman who catches it, superstition has it, will be the next to marry. The process is repeated for unmarried men with the groom tossing the bride's garter for the same purpose. References * Jenny M.

It was named after the World War I aviator Max Immelmann. It served until its dissolution in October 1943. The wing operated the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, exclusively, in the combat role. Formed on 1 May 1939 StG 2 fought in the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939 which started World War II. It formed part of Luftflotte 2 in May and June 1940 and flew in support of Army Group A in the Battle of Belgium and Battle of France. StG 2 remained with Luftflotte 2 during the Battle of Britain before transferring to southern Europe to participate in the Battle of the Mediterranean. In the south it mainly served in the Maritime interdiction role as it bombarded Malta from January to March 1941. The wing then fought in the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Battle of Crete in April 1941 in the Martime, Air interdiction, counter-air and close air support role alongside StG 1, StG 3 and StG 77. The Ju 87 groups were successful in the Battle of Crete, the final phase of the Greek campaign. Elements of the wing fought in the North African Campaign until January 1942. The bulk of StG 2 fought on the Eastern Front from 22 June 1941, after Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union began. It fought in support of all three Army Groups, and served in major battles such as the Siege of Leningrad, Battle of Moscow and Battle of Stalingrad in 1941 and 1942. StG 2 supported German forces in the Battle of Kursk, one of the last major offensives on the Eastern Front in July 1943. The vulnerability of the Ju 87 and the loss of air superiority to the Red Air Force, precluded any further large-scale use of the aircraft in the traditional dive-bombing role. In October 1943, the Ju 87 units were renamed Schlachtgeschwader, battle wings, with a mixed number of Ju 87s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s operating in the anti-tank role. Stab., I., and III./StG 2 was renamed Schlachtgeschwader 2 on the 18 October 1943, and ceased to exist. II./StG 2 continued, without redesignation to operate until January 1944, when its staffeln (squadrons) were renamed and equipped. Background The dive-bomber is often associated with German aerial development in the pre-war era, but the type remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic Luftwaffe. This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of World War I stemmed from the belief among the General Staff (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) that army support aviation in 1917‚Äì1918 was purely a reaction to trench warfare. German air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of Operativer Luftkrieg (Operational Air War) which stressed interdiction, strategic bombing (when and if possible) but primarily the air supremacy mission. The Spanish Civil War experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept later in the 1930s, though the war's influence on German operational preferences remain ambiguous. On the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of Luftwaffe front-line strength contained specialist ground- attack aircraft in September 1939. The lack of specialist close support aircraft left the general-purpose dive-bomber, the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, most suited to the close support role. =Formation= Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 was formed on 1 May 1939 upon the establishment of all three Gruppen. The Stabsstaffel (command unit) was formed at K√∂ln‚ÄìOstheim on 15 October 1939. The stab unit was predominantly equipped with Dornier Do 17 aircraft and a handful of Ju 87s for reconnaissance and personnel transport purposes. The Gruppen were equipped with the Ju 87 dive bomber. The wing's first commanding officer was Oskar Dinort. I./StG 2 was established in Breslau from I./StG 163. II./StG 2 in Stolp-Reitt from I./StG 162, and III./StG 2 from III./StG 163 in Langensalza. Dinort led the wing and first Gruppe upon StG 2's creation. Dinort then relinquished command of I./StG 2 for control of Stab./StG 2. Hauptmann Ulrich Schmidt and Ernst Ott commanded the first and second Gruppen. Hauptmann Hubertus Hitschhold succeeded Dinort mid-way through StG's first major campaign. In August 1939 Dinort moved I./StG 2 to Nieder-Ellguth under the Fliegerdivision 2 (Flying Division 2) subordinated to Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4). 38 Ju 87s were available to Dinort, only one was non-operational. An additional three Dornier Do 17P reconnaissance aircraft were operational. Ulrich Schmidt commanded 38 Ju 87s, all but two operational with three Do 17P aircraft. Based at Stolp-Reitz, Schmidt was subordinated to Fliegerdivision 1 (Flying Division) and Luftflotte 1 (Air Fleet 1). III./StG 2 was assigned the same division and air fleet with second Gruppe. 34 of 36 Ju 87s and the three Do 17Ps were available at Stolp-West, near Annafeld and Danzig by 1 September 1939. World War II =Poland= On 1 September 1939 the German Wehrmacht began the invasion of Poland followed sixteen days later by the Soviet invasion of Poland. Luftflotte 4 supported the 14th Army attacking out of Slovak Republic. Luftflotte 4's bombers dropped 389 tons of bombs on 1 September, 200 on Krak√≥w in 1,200 sorties. Leutnant Frank Neubert and Unteroffizier Frank Kilnger from 1 staffel are believed to have claimed the first aerial victory of the war against a PZL P.11. Captain Mieczys≈Çaw Medwecki, 121 Squadron, Polish Air Force, was taking off from Balice airfield. A staffel of Ju 87s in formation, 1939 Dinort led his gruppe into action against airfields at Krak√≥w and Katowice. Later in the morning Dinort led the group in the bombing of Wielu≈Ñ, ostensibly to destroy a Polish Army cavalry unit reported in the town. German intelligence was wrong and Polish sources assert no Polish military unit was present. Dinort's I./StG 2 attacked the roads in the town; the bombing caused many civilian fatalities. Schmidt and Ulrich's gruppen attacked other targets and were not involved. Schmidt was replaced by Hauptmann Claus Hinkelbein from 10 September. Counter air operations against the Polish Air Force failed since the Polish fighter force dispersed and succeeding in getting airborne. Along with elements of StG 77, I./StG 2 claimed the destruction of the Wo≈Çy≈Ñska Cavalry Brigade at the Battle of Mokra. Though it sustained 20 percent casualties the brigade was far from destroyed. On 3 September the Ju 87 groups under Richthofen's command contributed to the destruction of 7th Polish Division. Army Group North's operations were supported by the other gruppen. The Polish Corridor and its elimination were the initial priority for the 4th Army, supported by Luftflotte 1. The targets were harbours, roads and bridges in the Danzig. III./StG 2 supported the Battle of Westerplatte and Battle of Danzig Bay. second and third group supported attacks on the Polish Navy, after ineffective assaults by the Kriegsmarine. II./StG 2 fought in the Battle of Radom until 9 September but little of its further service in Poland is known. I. and III./StG 2 assisted in the destruction of the Prusy Army at Radom. Two gruppen moved south toward I./StG 2. I. and III./StG 2 fought in the Battle of the Bzura. III./StG 2 attacked road and troop concentrations in the Battle of Lw√≥w. From 2‚Äì6 September I./StG 2 repeatedly attacked Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski rail station inflicting heavy casualties on detraining Polish infantry forces in the Battle of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. The 40 Ju 87s comprised elements of I./StG 2 and StG 76. Of the three gruppen, III./StG 2 is known to have taken part in the siege of Warsaw. First gruppe fought in the Battle of Modlin as Polish resistance collapsed. StG 2 Ju 87s under maintenance, 1939/40. The Ju 87 in the foreground carries the emblem of 4 staffel. The aircraft in the background appears to be from 5 staffel. The Polish campaign ended on 6 October 1939. On 15 October the stabstaffel was formed and Dinort assumed command. Hubertus Hitschhold took command of first gruppe. Dinort's small command unit mustered three Ju 87s [which could attach themselves to any staffel or gruppe] and six Do 17 M reconnaissance aircraft. I./StG 76 was assigned to Stab./StG 2 in the winter, a practice common in the Luftwaffe. I./StG 2 located to Cologne in October under Fliegerkorps VIII. During the Phoney War I./StG 2 trained at Hildesheim on attacking Belgian Army fortresses. In January the gruppe located to Marburg. II./StG 2 spent the period near Cologne; little is known about its activity over the winter. III./StG 2's activities mirrored first gruppe. II./StG 2 commanding officer Hinkelbein was replaced with Major Georg Fritze on 27 October and then on 16 December Walter Enneccerus took command. =Western Europe= Stab., I. and III./StG 2 were placed under the control of Fliegerkorps VIII, subordinated to Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 initially. Stab. gained I./StG 76 but lost II./StG 2 which was placed under the command of Stab./StG 3 subordinated to Luftflotte 3 commanded by Hugo Sperrle. Hitschhold had 40 aircraft with 33 operational. Enneccerus was given 38 Ju 87s with 33 serviceable under StG 3 commodore Karl Angerstein. Major Clemens Graf von Sch√∂nborn-Wiesentheid took command of III./StG 2 on 15 April 1940 from Ott. Only 27 of the 38 machines assigned to him were combat ready. Despite the condition of the gruppe, all units were committed to Fall Gelb. Cologne hosted stab. and I./StG 2 at the beginning of the offensive. N√∂rvenich was home to III./StG 2. All of them were under the control of Richthofen. II./StG 2 located to Siegburg under von Griem's Fliegerkorps V. Hitschhold's gruppe were involved in the counter air campaign during the invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940. A dive bombing attack at Brustem airfield destroyed nine Belgian Air Force Fiat CR.42 fighters of the 15. Belgian air defences were rendered useless. Dinort's StG 2 played a crucial role in supporting the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael by preventing Belgian reinforcements from counterattacking German paratroopers. III./StG 2 and I./StG 77, with elements of LG 2 assisted with the fort's capture though the position remained under heavy Belgian fire. Hitschhold lost five Ju 87s attacking forts at Namur and Li√®ge on 11 May to Royal Air Force fighter. III./StG 2 fought in the battles and engaged in combat operations during the Battle of the Netherlands at the Battle of Maastricht. Road traffic at Tirlemont and Antwerp on 11 May. It aided the crossing of the Oise in the initial days. 11 Ju 87s from I. and II./StG 2 were lost to 3, 87 and No. 607 Squadron RAF, despite fighter protection from Jagdgeschwader 27 during 11 May. Third gruppe lost four aircraft to French Curtiss P-36 Hawks on the 11 May and supported the battles at Gembloux by attacking French armour suffering a solitary casualty to RAF fighters on 12 May. Another was lost on 14 and 15 May at Gembloux. I./StG 76, under Dinort's direct command, with Otto Wei√ü's II.(S)/LG 2, supported XVI Army Corps commanded by Erich Hoepner. During the course of the Battle of Hannut, and Battle of Gembloux Gap I./StG 76 lost seven Ju 87s to anti-aircraft defences. Some of Wei√ü's pilots flew eight sorties. Hitschhold's gruppe was engaged in support of the battles. StG 2 remained supporting the 6th Army against the K-W Line to the 12/13 May. Thereafter, StG 2 turned to the Battle in France. The wing contributed 200 sorties to the Battle of Sedan, and the breakout to the English Channel. Specifically second group were involved in the battle during the breakout phase on 14 May. StG 2 switched to support the 12th army for two days, south of Namur from 18 May. Over 15‚Äì17 May, Hitschhold's group moved to Saint- Quentin, Aisne, then on to Cambrai. III./StG 2 move through southern Belgium to Bastogne by 15 May. Operating from forward airfields, it played a role in the defeat of Charles de Gaulle's 4th Armoured Division at the Battle of Montcornet, on 17‚Äì19 May. It bombed the bridges over the Serre and destroyed French transport vehicles with towed artillery pieces. De Gaulle later remarked about III./StG 2's Stukas; > They continued to bomb us until sunset and consequently they destroyed our > wheeled vehicles, which were confined to the roads, and our supporting > artillery, which had no cover. The battle of Montcornet and Cr√©cy-sur-Serre effectively destroyed the French Ninth Army. On 18 May the Ju 87s assisted in the defeat of the French 1st Arnoured Division outside St Quentin, and attacked troop trains in Soissons, which blocked the exits from Amiens. Their bombs also defeated a French tank attack at Laon. The gruppe joined II./StG 2 in the Cambrai area at Beaulieu. Both gruppen prepared for operations against the Channel ports from 22 May. Before turning to anti-shipping operations, the third group's notable contribution was the Battle of Arras, and the defeat of a British counterattack. I./StG 2 joined the attacks over Arras. The burning oil tanks at Dunkirk. Bomb craters have scarred the landscape The Royal Navy began Operation Dynamo to evacuate the British Army. All three gruppen supported the army in its drive to the Channel ports. StG 2 carried out attacks on shipping in the Battle of Boulogne, siege of Calais and then the Battle of Dunkirk. At Boulogne, the French Navy lost and crippled by Ju 87s. Both have been credited to I. and II./StG 2, the former was beached and finished by German artillery. In a major action, Dinort led 39 Ju 87s from gruppen I. and II in an attack on Admiral James Somerville's forces off Calais on 24 May. The 10th Panzer Division requested air support against Royal Navy warships bombarding their positions as the division fought its way into Calais. The light cruisers Arethusa, Galatea, and destroyers Grafton, Greyhound, Verity, Wessex, Wolfhound, Vimiera and Polish Navy destroyer Bzura were subjected to an intense dive bombing attack. Wessex was sunk, Vimiera and Bzura were damaged. The Ju 87s suffered no loss in their unopposed attacks. Six of the Wessex crew were killed and 15 wounded. The Stukas survived an attack from RAF Fighter Command fighters operating from England without loss. StG 77 and StG 2 were instrumental in eliminating Allied resistance in Calais. Operations turned to Dunkirk. On 27 May the troopship C√¥te d' Azur was sunk by StG 2, which also bombed the harbour with 500 and 1,000-pound bombs. KG 2 and KG 3 followed up the attacks. Their bombing runs destroyed the oil tanks and contributed to the inferno. Around 15,000 high explosive and 30,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Dunkirk by 300 German aircraft. Ju 87s continued to take a heavy toll of shipping; StG 2 and 77 were operating over the evacuation beaches. On 29 May the destroyer Grenade was severely damaged by a Ju 87 attack and subsequently sank. The French destroyer Mistral was crippled by bomb damage the same day. Jaguar and Verity were badly damaged while the trawlers Calvi and Polly Johnson (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. The merchant ship Fenella (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. The attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. The rail ships Lorina and Normannia (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also. By 29 May, the Allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged. On 1 June the Ju 87s sank the Skipjack (815 tons) while the destroyer Keith was sunk and Basilisk was crippled before being scuttled by Whitehall. Whitehall was later badly damaged and along with Ivanhoe, staggered back to Dover. Havant, commissioned for just three weeks, was sunk and in the evening the French destroyer Foudroyant sank. On 1 June the steamer Pavon was lost while carrying 1,500 Dutch soldiers most of whom were killed. The oil tanker Niger was also destroyed. A flotilla of French minesweepers were also lost‚ÄîDenis Papin (264 tons), the Le Moussaillon (380 tons) and Venus (264 tons). StG 2 played a role in Fall Rot, the final phase of the French campaign. I./StG 2 supported the 9th army as it pushed towards Laon and from the 8 June, the 9th and 6th army over the Seine and Marne. It supported the army in the battles of P√©ronne, Somme, Amiens, Roye, Chauny, and Nogent and the advances east of Paris over the Yonne and Loire. II./StG 2 protected the 5th Panzer Division in the capture of Rouen and ended the campaign in Beauvais. III./StG 2's operations supported the same advances and ended the campaign in Auxerre. The Armistice of 22 June 1940 curtailed any further moves south. The battles cost I./StG 2 at least 15 aircraft, II./StG 2 13 Ju 87s and III./StG 2 another 10 equating to 38 Ju 87s in total, the vast majority in combat with Allied fighter aircraft. =Battle of Britain= From 22 June to 10 July 1940 aerial skirmishes occurred over the English Channel between RAF Fighter Command and the Luftwaffe, operating from airfields in German-occupied Belgium and France. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht was planning for a possible invasion, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The aerial battles gradually escalated as German operations moved to destroying Channel shipping‚Äîtermed the Kanalkampf phase‚Äîand then Fighter Command defences in what became known as the Battle of Britain. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe left the two German air fleet commanders, Sperrle and Kesselring to carry out attacks on targets of their choosing in June and early July for there was little direction from the OKL. On 2 July, German attacks caught convoy OA177G en route for Gibraltar. StG 2 sank the British steamer Aeneas () south-east of Start Point, Devon; 18 crewmen died and the rest were rescued by the destroyer and later StG 2 damaged the British steamer Baron Ruthven (). I. and II./StG 2 moved to Laon and Lannion before moving to the Pas-de-Calais and III./StG 2 group moved to Caen. On 4 July 1940 the wing attacked Convoy OA 178 (convoy outbound Atlantic) as it passed through the Channel. 14 merchantmen left the Thames Estuary, bound for the west coast and passed Dover on 3 July. German radar picked up the convoy and the Luftwaffe was ordered to intercept the ships. A Junkers Ju 88 reconnaissance aircraft from 1.(F)/123 flew over the Channel and reported that the convoy was south-west of Portland. I./StG 2 took off, led by Dinort with 24 Ju 87s, escorted by a Staffel of fighters from I./JG 1. The attack was followed by 23 Ju 87s of III./StG 51. The ships were close to the French coast when Dallas City was damaged, engulfed in flames and collided with Flimson which was also hit and the ships took 15 minutes to disengage; Dallas City later sank. Antonio was heavily damaged. Deucalion (), Kolga () and Britsum () were sunk and SS Canadian Constructor, was damaged for no German loss. Convoys \\"Booty\\" and \\"Agent\\" passed through on 11 July. Dinort's wing attacked shipping along the coast. The Stukas sank () with one casualty. 501 Squadron had scrambled but was engaged by the Bf 109 escort and lost one pilot shot down and drowned; No. 609 Squadron RAF arrived as the Ju 87s began their dives. The six Spitfires split, one section of three engaging the Stukas and the other taking on the escort. Overwhelmed by odds of 6:1, the squadron was routed, with the loss of two pilots killed for no loss to the Germans; none of the merchant vessels were hit. A second attack was ordered. At 11:00 GMT, Hawker Hurricanes from No. 601 Squadron RAF were scrambled to intercept a reconnaissance Do 17, missed it and stumbled into a formation from III./StG 2 escorted by about 40 Messerschmitt Bf 110s, that British radar failed to locate. The escorts were too high above the Ju 87s to stop the first attack. Most squadrons in the Middle Wallop sector were re-fuelling but six 238 Squadron Hurricanes were scrambled, with three more from 501 and 87 Squadrons and nine from 213 Squadron near Exeter. None arrived in time to stop the attack on Portland at 11:53 GMT but little damage was done and only one vessel was damaged. A Ju 87 was destroyed and another force-landed; the light Stuka losses were a result of the Bf 110s bearing the brunt of the fighter attacks. Bf 110 pilot Hans-Joachim G√∂ring, nephew of Hermann G√∂ring, commander in chief of the Luftwaffe was killed protecting the Stukas. The British steamer Kylemount () was damaged off Dartmouth and the steamers Peru () and City of Melbourne () were damaged in Portland harbour. Eleanor Brooke () was damaged off Portland and the Dutch steamer Mies () was damaged south of Portland Bill. On 29 July a further raid yielded success. At 19:25 III./StG 2 Ju 87s led by Gruppenkommandeur Walter Enneccerus sank the destroyer off Portland. The ship was crippled and on fire, as the Stukas left the scene unchallenged and the sinking Delight made for the coast off Portland. The destroyers and Broke rescued 147 men and 59 wounded but 19 of the crew were killed. The burning vessel remained afloat until 21:30, when there was a large explosion and it sank. The Admiralty withdrew all destroyer flotillas from the Channel and ordered no convoy to sail the Channel in daylight. This order had been given on 26 July before Delight sailed and some sources note that standing orders had been broken. RAF pilots examine a Ju 87, shot down while attacking a convoy. Across the 7 an 8 August 1940 a large air-sea battle developed around Convoy Peewitt which involved Kriegsmarine E-boats. In the late morning StG 2, 3 and 77 from Angers, Caen and St. Malo were escorted by Bf 110s from V./LG 1, to attack the convoy south of the Isle of Wight, with about 30 Bf 109s from II. and III./JG 27 for high cover. From 12:20, Spitfires of 609 Squadron and Hurricanes from 257 and 145 squadrons attacked the German formations, joined later by 238 Squadron. The Ju 87s severely damaged SS Surte, MV Scheldt and SS Omlandia and sank SS Balmaha soon after. SS Tres was sunk by StG 77. SS Empire Crusader, in the lead, was hit by StG 2 and sank several hours later; four ships were sunk and four were damaged in the attacks. From 20 to 30 RAF fighters attacked the German aircraft and I. and II./StG 2 suffered one damaged Ju 87 each. On 13 August Adlertag began to destroy Fighter Command. Targets for the day were the Portland area and airfields specifically RAF Middle Wallop and neighbouring radar station and RAF Warmwell. 52 Ju 87s from StG 1 and StG 2 took off RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a fighter sweep ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. I./JG 53 made landfall at 16:00. The sweep failed to attract and divert RAF squadrons. Instead, all it succeeded in doing was to alert the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of LG 1 and StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters. II., and III./JG 53 and III./ZG 76 flew escort for the Ju 87s. ZG 2 and JG 27 flew escort for LG 1. In response the whole of No. 10 Group RAF intercepted. One staffel II./StG 2 was badly hit by 609 Squadron; six out of nine Ju 87s were shot down. StG 1 and 2 gave up on their original targets owing to clouds. Both headed for Portland. I./StG 2, with 29 of 35 aircraft operational, was ordered to bomb an airfield near Rochford but abandoned the mission due to bad weather. Enneccerus' II./StG 2 turned back when the formation of 27 was intercepted and promptly lost six Ju 87s [from an operational total off 33 from 39]. Enneccerus and his gruppe were tasked with destroying RAF Hawkinge on 15 August, a date known as \\"black Thursday\\" in the Luftwaffe. He lost four Ju 87s in the process. On 16 August StG 2 was involved in a large-scale attack on airfields in southern England. RAF Tangmere was the target. Dinort's wing encountered strong fighter opposition over the target area near Portsmouth. Hitschhold lost five crews and three aircraft damaged from I. gruppe. Br√ºcker's III./StG 2 bombed Tangmere and radar station at Selsey Bill. He lost four aircraft and three damaged. From 16 August 1940 it was non-operational. Two days later, the Stukas suffered a comprehensive defeat in \\"The Hardest Day\\" battles and were subsequently withdrawn from air superiority operations. StG 77 lost 22 aircraft destroyed or damaged on that day. For the Stuka wings spent the rest of their time on the Channel front idle. StG 2 carried out training exercises and occasional \\"special\\" missions which amounted to low-level attacks against coastal shipping at dusk. Hitschhold's group provided crews and aircraft for the Karl Ritter propaganda film Stukas with III./StG 2. The film was a box-office hit in Germany. Quartermaster General of the Luftwaffe reported significant losses for StG 2 from 4 July to 18 August 1940. StG 2 lost 25 Ju 87s with five more damaged. 19 were killed in action, four wounded in action and 18 missing in action. I./StG 2 suffered the loss of ten aircraft, four damaged, eight killed, one wounded and five wounded. II./StG 2 lost also lost ten aircraft, seven dead, one wounded, seven missing and two captured. III./StG 2 lost five Stukas and one damaged. Four men were killed, two wounded, six missing. Total Ju 87 losses from 3 July to 24 December 1940 amounted to 101 destroyed, 84 damaged to all causes. =Malta and North Africa= I. with III./StG 2 moved to Otopeni north of Bucharest, Romania under Richthofen in January 1941 after the cancelation of Operation Felix. II./StG 2 remained with Stab./StG 3. It staged southward to Sicily in December 1940 to interdict shipping between Sicily and Tunisia. Walter Enneccerus and II gruppe began operations supporting the Italian Siege of Malta. The group was in action on 10 January. The British Operation Excess was launched, which included a series of convoy operations by the British across the Mediterranean Sea. On 10 January they were within range of the Ju 87 bases. II./StG 2 sent 43 Ju 87s with support from I./StG 1. Some 10 Ju 87s attacked the carrier unopposed. Witnessed by Andrew Cunningham, C-in-C of the Mediterranean Fleet from the battleship , the Ju 87s scored six hits. One destroyed a gun, another hit near her bow, a third demolished another gun, while two hit the lift, wrecking the aircraft below deck, causing explosions of fuel and ammunition. Another went through the armoured deck and exploded deep inside the ship. Two further attacks were made without result. Badly damaged, but with her main engines still intact, she steered for Malta. Warspite was also damaged. The attack lasted six minutes; killed 126 crew members and wounded 91. Within sight of Malta, Italian torpedo bombers also attacked the carrier, but were driven off by intense anti-aircraft fire. Cunningham remarked of the Stukas; > There was no doubt we were watching complete experts. Formed roughly in a > large circle over the fleet, they peeled off one by one when reaching > attacking position. We could not but admire the skill and precision of it > all. The attacks were pressed home to point-blank range, and as they pulled > out of the dives some were seen to fly along the flight deck of the > Illustrious below the level of the funnel. HMS Illustrious under Ju 87 attack in the Grand Harbour. The carrier is to the right of the large crane On 11 January 1941, 10 more Ju 87s were sent by Enneccerus to sink Illustrious. They chanced upon the light cruisers and . Hits were scored on both; Southampton was so badly damaged her navy escorts scuttled her. Over the next 12 days, the workers at the shipyard in the Grand Harbour repaired the carrier under determined air attack so that she might make Alexandria. On 13 January, the Ju 87s, now equipped with SC 1000 bombs failed to achieve a hit. On 14 January, 44 Ju 87s scored a hit on the ill- fated after lift. On 18 January, the Germans switched to attacking the airfields at Hal Far and RAF Luqa in an attempt to win air superiority before returning to Illustrious. On 20 January, two near misses breached the hull below the water line and hurled her hull against the wharf. Nevertheless, the engineers won the battle. On 23 January, she slipped out of Grand Harbour, and arrived in Alexandria two days later. The carrier later sailed to America where she was kept out of action for a year. I./StG 1 and II./StG 2 had failed in their mission to sink the aircraft carrier. Albeit the cost was minimal; three aircraft on 10 January and four aircraft until the carrier departed. By 5 February II./StG 2 was based at Trapani. The Italian invasion of Egypt in September 1940 failed. A British Army counter-attack, Operation Compass, drove the Italian African Army back into Libya. Erwin Rommel and the German Africa Corps were dispatched to prevent an Axis collapse in North Africa. The 60 Ju 87s of I./StG 1 and II./StG 2 were dispatched to Tripoli. The two gruppen were the only offensive assets the Germans had in North Africa in February 1941. The German airmen were mostly from northern Germany and were unused to the harsh desert conditions. The first Stuka actions took place around the 14 February and resulted in the first losses. Operation Sonnenblume developed into a full-scale offensive which recovered Libya, with the exception of Tobruk. Enneccerus led his group on a carpet bombing attack in an attempt to support the capture of the besieged port. On 3 April Enneccerus lost three to six Ju 87s to the Desert Air Force in the Benghazi area. on 14 April, II./StG 2 and III./StG 1 lost four men between them over Tobruk; the port's defending fighter, from No. 73 Squadron RAF, claimed three Ju 87s. Enneccerus maintained the pressure on shipping supplying the garrison while repulsing attempts to relieve the port over land. In May the group attacked the carrier Formidable without success. The carrier was damaged by the group, but not fatally. Enneccerus was personally credited with a hit via a 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb. It hit the forward flight deck, then destroyed the 4.5 inch (11.43 cm) turret and blew out the starboard side of the ship below the fo'c'sle. One of her escorts, Nubian was heavily damaged in the same attack. In the Admiralty \\"Report of Proceedings\\", 26 May 1941, her captain, commander G. H Stokes reported after the action that some Stukas attacked from low-level. II./StG 2 Ju 87 escorted by a JG 27 Bf 109, January 1941 By 15 July the group was based at Derna. It fought over Bardia and Sollum during the British offensive Operation Battleaxe. That day it lost as many as five Ju 87s as Axis forces fell back into Libya and Tobruk was relieved. No losses were reported between 15 July and 30 October 1941. Subsequently, it is difficult to track the unit's movements and activities. Enneccerus' group was active in resisting Operation Crusader. First gruppe fought in the First Battle of Bir Gubi and Second Battle of Bir el Gubi. On 13 January 1942 II./StG 2 was renamed III./StG 3 at San Pancrazio. II./StG 2 was reformed in East Prussia, and sent to the Soviet Union. =Yugoslavia, Greece and Crete= In October 1940 the Greco-Italian War began with the invasion of Greece by the Italian Empire. The invasion failed, and the Greek Army pushed out their enemy into Italian protectorate of Albania. The prospect of British Empire support and the establishment of a second Allied foothold on the continent forced Hitler to assist Mussolini. Hitler developed Operation Marita, the German-led invasion of Greece with support from Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria. Yugoslavia refused to join the Axis powers, and the operation was expanded to include the country in German plans. Richthofen's air corps was given two wings of Ju 87s for the task; StG 2 and 3. Stab./StG 2 was moved to Kraynitsi, 42 km south-south west of Sofia, Bulgaria on 6 March 1941. Hitschhold's group, I./StG 2 followed on 27 March with 39 Stukas. II/StG 2 remained in Africa, but III./StG 2 under Br√ºcker moved to Belica-North, 85 km south-south east of Sofia on 6 March. 35 of the 38 Ju 87s were available for combat operations on 6 April. The German invasion of Yugoslavia and the Battle of Greece commenced on 6 April. Suda Bay in the aftermath of a German air attack, May 1941 Richthofen's Ju 87s supported the German Twelfth Army in southern Yugoslavia, which cut the Yugoslav Army off from Greece and the Allied expeditionary forces there. The victory in Yugoslavia was complete with the bombing of Belgrade, which facilitated a rapid victory by destroying command and control centres. I./StG 2 dive-bombed Yugoslav force opposite Petrich and the Metaxas Line, and subsequent Battle of the Metaxas Line. It is not clear whether the group took part in the Belgrade bombing; it may have done. The group attacked British forces in Arta, and the advances on Skopje, Prilep, Veles and Salonika. The Stukas facilitated the breakthrough at the Battle of Lake Kastoria, and the battles at Olympia, Larissa, Volos and Battle of Thermopylae. They also supported the advances in Corinthia and Pelponisia. From 22 April they were operating in against shipping in the Megara Gulf. They also sank a number of ships in the Gulf of Corinth. III./StG 3 in the majority of the same battles. It flew combat missions against the Royal Yugoslav Air Force bases and notably assisted in the seizure of the Corinth Canal on 26 April. The attacks against shipping evacuating Allied forces from Greece were successful. Richhofen's airmen claimed 280,000 tons of shipping (60 vessels) destroyed up until 30 April 1941; the claims were approximately correct. Athens fell on 27 April and the bulk of mainland Greece was under Axis control by 30 April. Operation Demon‚Äîthe Allied evacuation from Greece‚Äîsucceeded; three-quarters of 60,000 men were evacuated. Allied losses were substantial. The Greek destroyer Hydra was sunk in the Gulf of Megara on 22 April. In total the Hellenic Navy lost four torpedo boats‚ÄîGreek torpedo boat Kios among them‚Äîthree mine-layers and with Allied naval forces a further 43 merchant ships totalling 63,975 tons to the 23 April. Hitschhold's group flew daily attacks against shipping near and around Crete. Hitschhold's men probably sank the Greek destroyer Hydra at Piraeus naval base, which lost 23 vessels in two days. Greek destroyer Psara was sunk at anchor off Megara. Other Ju 87s from I./StG 2 sank other Greek merchant vessels in the Gulf Corinth. Among the losses was the sinking of the SS Slamat, in the Slamat disaster. British destroyers and were also sunk. The final phase of the Balkans Campaign, was the Battle of Crete. III./StG 3 moved to Megara and attacked shippin in the Aegean from 1 to 19 May and then Malaoi. Br√ºcker's group was joined by Hitschhold's in preparation for the invasion. Hitschhold's I./StG 2 was moved to Argos. The invasion began on 20 May 1941. StG 2‚Äîboth gruppen‚Äî with KG 2 and KG 26, bombarded anti-aircraft artillery positions before 493 Junkers Ju 52 transports began dropping German paratroops over the Cretian airfields. On 22 May Hitschhold's group sank the cruiser Gloucester with five 1,000 lb bombs. 45 officers and 648 men were killed. The ship sank in 35 minutes. The unit contributed to the sinking of Fiji in the same action. The damaged Fiji was later sunk by Bf 109 fighter-bombers. Captain Louis Mountbatten led four destroyers under over of darkness past Antikythera island to bombard Maleme airfield. In the morning they were spotted at 07:55 hours m by more than 20 Ju 87s led by Gruppenkommandeur Hitschhold. The dive-bombers attacked immediately. They sank the British destroyers Greyhound on 22 May and the Kelly and Kashmir on 23 May. After taking a hit amidships, Kashmir sank in less than two minutes. Hitschold lost four of his Ju 87s. 131 crewmen died aboard Kelly and 80 on Kashmir. The destroyer Kipling rescued 129 men from Kelly and 153 from Kashmir but her oil tanks were damaged by incessant dive-bombing attacks on her way to Alexandria. III./StG 2 participated in the action on 29 May, which sank the destroyer Hereward, and damaging of the light cruiser Ajax and destroyer Decoy. The destroyer Imperial was damaged during the attack and later scuttled. In the midst of the action the light cruiser Orion was hit; 107 men and officers were killed and a further 84 wounded. The damaged cruiser York, imobilised by Italian naval forces, attracted the Stukas, whose dive-bombing destroyed the ship's superstructure and armament. During the battles of Crete the gruppe claimed sunk and damaged. =Eastern Front 1941; Operation Barbarossa= On 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union began the war on the Eastern Front. Dinort and StG 2 moved to German-occupied Poland with Stab., I., and III./StG 2. The wing was placed under the command of Richthofen again, subordinating them to Fliegekorps VIII, attached to Kesselring's Luftflotte 2. The air fleet was detailed to support Army Group Centre. StG 2 was tasked with bombing Alytus airfield after 5./ZG 26 carried out a low-level attack. 8 SAD's 15 IAP managed to get airborne, though the I./JG 27 fighter screen; elements of JG 53 attacked the airfield simultaneously. Just two Ju 87s were lost on the Eastern Front on 22 June. In the first days of the invasion, the gruppen supported the break through of the 9th army and 3rd Panzer Army, breaking through at Suwa≈Çki. They fought in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, and the advances on Vitebsk and Vilnus, which forced a bridgehead over the Dnieper. StG 2 assisted in air attacks of Red Army concentrations near Grodno. From 22‚Äì30 June StG 2 lost seven aircraft. The entire air corps was deployed in support of the encirclement and then a further such operation in the Battle of Smolensk. Richthofen, Dinort and Walter Storp, commanding SKG 210, were awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves for their contribution to the Minsk battle. StG 2 bombed the railhead at Yermachevo, and the road from Polotsk to Nevel. In July the wing suffered nine losses with another damaged. I./StG 2's commander Hitschhold was shot down on 23 June near Vilna. 3./StG 2's Bruno Freitag landed to pick them up. On 8 August Richthofen's air corps was moved to support Army Group North under the command of Luftflotte 1. Dinort was ordered to support the capture or encirclment of the city. The purpose of the move was to assist the 16th army's advance across the Velikaya River between Idritsa and Pskov, to Staraya Russa near Lake Ilmen. Thereafter, it supported the push to Lyuban on the road to Leningrad. On 13 August I./StG 2 knocked out a major supply bridge on the Volkhov River which disrupted withdrawing Soviet forces. StG 2 rendered invaluable support to the XXXIX Panzer Corps and XXXVIII Army Corps at Schl√ºsselburg, cutting off Leningrad, beginning the siege of the city and leaving the Road of Life the only means to supply the defenders. By September 1941, both gruppen were operating against supply and troop concentrations around Lake Ladoga. On 19 September StG 2 formed part of six major bombing raids against the city from 08:14 and 23:00. 442 people were killed when a hospital was hit. StG 2 lost three Ju 87s. Through August StG 2 lost three destroyed and one damaged and the following month five Ju 87s were lost. The Baltic Fleet operated from Leningrad in the Gulf of Finland. The powerful fleet provided the Red Army with fire support along the coastline. Richthofen was ordered to destroy the fleet and he tasked Dinort with the task. The anti- aircraft artillery barrages over the city were heavy. Among the first victims of StG 2 operations was the Soviet destroyer Steregushchy. Soviet destroyer Gordy, Grozyaschi, and Silny were damaged. One pilot, Hans-Ulrich Rudel sank the battleship Marat. In the same action, the commanding officer of III./StG 2, Ernst-Siegfried Steen was killed when he was shot down attacking the Soviet cruiser Kirov. Steen crashed alongside the ship and his bomb detonated damaging the vessel. A third vessel, battleship October Revolution was damaged during the attacks. Soviet destroyer Minsk was sunk in shallow waters by a bomb dropped by Leutnant Egbert Jaekel. Hauptmann G√ºnther Schwarzel took temporary command on 24 September until replaced by Gustav Pre√üler, 1 October. On 28 September, future Geschwaderkommodore Ernst Kupfer, flew three missions to Leningrad and was shot down each time; the first mission resulted in a hit on a cruiser but he was hit by Soviet fighters and force landed at an airfield. On the second he was damaged by ground fire after a hit in the engine. On the third occasion he and his gunner were wounded when they crashed into a forest after taking damage from ground fire. Both groups were returned to Luftflotte 2 for the Battle of Moscow. The German offensive began on 2 October 1941. I./StG 2 fought over the Vyazma pocket until 9 October. Thereafter, it supported the 9th army and 3rd Panzer army advancing on Moscow. Fourteen days into the battle, Dinort was replaced by Paul-Werner Hozzel. Second gruppe was still in Africa. Hozzel could only call upon Stab, I. and III./StG 2 for the offensive; the units could muster 70 aircraft which was approximately 70 percent of the wing's strength. Hozzel's forces supported the push to Klin during the encirclement phase of the battle along with the advances on Kalinin and then Tula. From 21 October it fought over Torzhok against Soviet forces trying to encircle the 1st Panzer Division. The temperature soon dipped and by the first week of November it fell to ‚Äì20¬∞. Ju 87 engines failed to start. Hozzel noted in his diary that only one operation was permitted on 13 November and one more five days later in support of the 110th Infantry Division. Hozzel utilised different ordnance depending on the mission supporting the advance across the Leningrad ‚ÄìMoscow Railway. For engaging Soviet armour, a 500 kg (1,102 lb) bomb with anti-tank warhead or a combination of three 250 kg (551 lb) bombs under the wings and fuselage. Primary targets at this time were troop concentrations, roads and railway traffic. Hozzel moved the wing six miles north of Mozhaysk, ten miles west of Moscow, on the Moskva River. Soviet resistance and the Russian Winter brought the advances to a halt. On 5 December 1941 the Red Army counter offensive ended the threat to Moscow and threatened to destroy Army Group Centre. Gustav Pre√üler and III./StG 2 remained on the Eastern Front. Bruno Dilley [who replaced Hitschhold in October] commanding I group returned to Germany and did II./StG 2 which left Africa in January 1942; it became part of StG 3 and reformed in East Prussia. Dilley's group recorded the temperature at ‚Äì50 when it left the front with virtually no serviceable aircraft. Over the course of October the wing lost nine aircraft, a single Ju 87 in November, and five in December. =Eastern Front 1942; Moscow and Stalingrad= III./StG 2 pulled back to Rzhev on 16 December losing seven Ju 87s in the transfer. II./LG 2 was attached to the gruppe but the combination could muster only 30 aircraft. JG 51 and the two bomber groups formed a provisional tactical command. The 4th Shock Army captured the supply hub at Toropets. The capture began a series of intensive battles which lasted another six months for III./StG 2 until withdrawn in May 1942. Recorded losses were six aircraft and one damaged. Eight men were reported missing, two killed and two wounded. The group was ordered to Markersdorf to rest and refit. It returned to the front to support the 1942 offensive towards Voronezh, before returning to Vyazma on 14 August 1942. Ju 87 over the ruins of Stalingrad II./StG 2 spent two months building its strength. At the time combat operations started on the Volkhov front in March 1942, it possessed only 12 aircraft, barely the size of a staffel. The group was in action over Novgorod and Leningrad, against the Baltic Fleet in April‚Äìthe raids against shipping took place over the 24th to 27th of the month. I./StG 2 supported the relief of German forces trapped in the Demyansk pocket. On 12 February 1942 Gruppenkommandeur Dilly was shot down near Staraya Russa but returned to German lines. By 13 March it claimed 25 Ju 87s operational but lost two Staffelkapit√§n killed. Few losses were experienced to fighters because the Ju 87s were escorted by Bf 109s from JG 54. Stab./StG 2 remained at the front. It had on strength 9 Messerschmitt Bf 110s and one Henschel Hs 123. Three Bf 110s were lost from 31 January to 19 March 1942. The unit was still based at Vyazma on 22 March. The command was withdrawn to East Prussia in May 1942. I./StG 2 moved at Graz in Austria to Akhtyrka airfield north west of Kharkov in June 1942. StG 2 remained with Richthofen's air corps, though now it subordinated to Luftflotte 4. From 22 June it supported German forces in the Battle of Voronezh, which formed part of Operation Blue, the 1942 German summer offensive into the Soviet Caucasus. The group began operating the Ju 87D at this time; it moved to Tatsinskaya Airfield on 20 July, then to Oblivskaya along the Chir River as the German 6th army advanced to Stalingrad. By mid-August it was bombing dug in Soviet armour west of the city. II./StG 2 lost 5 and 6 staffel commanding officers killed and wounded in the initial battles. The group fought at the Battle of Kalach in August, which defeated strong Soviet tank formations counter-attacking the 6th army. The Regia Aeronautica 21¬∫ Gruppo provided fighter escort during July 1942 owing to the lack of Bf 109 units available because of the actions over Stalingrad. The arrangement was not always adequate. On 25 July for example, 4./StG 2 lost four Ju 87s and their leader [M√∂bus] in combat with the 434 IAP. The two groups, with SG 1 and JG 3 helped the 6th army clear the Don Bend. In the battle for Kalach German air units dominated the sky and harried the 1st and 4th Tank Armies. Despite the efforts of the Soviet 8th Air Army, the Kalach pocket was destroyed with the loss of 50,000 men and 1,000 tanks as German bomber formations attacked, troop, vehicle, tanks, rail and airfield targets. On 23 August 1942 the Battle of Stalingrad began with the Bombing of Stalingrad from the air. Hozzel's wing was now based only 40 kilometres from the city. StG 2 was able to fly multiple missions per day and maintain a constant presence over the city. For the duration of the battle, this was \\"probably a typical day.\\" The 62nd army commanded by Vasily Chuikov sought to negate the threat of German air attacks by engaging the 6th army in close combat. Hozzel remarked that StG 2 had to abandon traditional dive-bombing in favour of improvised tactics; > We had to do precision bombing to avoid danger to our troops entrenched too > close to the target area. We could not risk making a dive-bombing attack > from 4,000 metres because of the wide area of bomb dispersion. We had to fly > a slant range attack, releasing bombs directly over the roofs. We had to > push bombs directly into the target like loaves of bread into an oven, with > one aircraft succeeding the other. The heavy bombs employed by the Stukas were fitted with delayed-action fuses, and anti-tank warheads to penetrate roofs, buildings and bunkers. Hozzel described their impact; \\"As on a string of pearls, one plane followed the others within an interval of a few seconds, throwing the bombs onto an oblong target area divided amongst us. Not one missed its target.\\" One Soviet soldier described the attacks as devastating to their defensive positions. Hozzel noted that the bombing was not as effective as German airmen believed. The infantry usually met a wall of return fire. Hozzel remarked that sometimes it seemed as if the \\"Geschwader had dropped toy torpedoes instead of bombs.\\" From 1 September II./StG 2 concentrated on sinking seaborne supply ships coming from east bank of the Volga. The Stukas proved effective in breaking up Soviet counters. On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and 66th Armies began an offensive against XIV Panzer Corps. The Soviets withdrew after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack. On 18 September, the Soviet 1st Guards and 24th Army attacked at Kotluban. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning. On 25 September III./StG 2 experienced a reverse when the 283 IAD intercepted it with 20 Yak-1 fighters. Three Ju 87s were destroyed and seven damaged. Acting group commander G√ºnther Schwarzel, in the absence of Pre√üler, returned to base at Oblivskaya but died of wounds later. Ju 87 climbs away after dropping its bomb over Stalingrad, October 1942. III./StG 2 served on the central sector as the battle in Stalingrad intensified. Gustav Pre√üler's formation supported the 2nd Panzer Army's Operation Wirbelwind east of Roslavl. III./StG 2 claimed the destruction, with the army, of 385 Field artillery guns and 550 tanks. The group supported the defence against the Soviet Kozelsk Offensive and the Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942. Of the recorded losses, from 15 August to 17 December 1942 on the central sector the group lost eight aircraft aircraft and three damaged. In mid-January 1943 it moved south due to the deteriorating German position at Stalingrad. The condition of the formation on 20 September was 29 aircraft with 25 operational. A report on 1 January 1943 simply listed 23 aircraft on strength. The Ju 87 units flew an average of 500 sorties per day over Stalingrad through to November 1942, losing an average of only one Stuka per day. The Battle of Stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the Stuka. First group fought over Stalingrad continuously. By 20 September it had only 16 operational Ju 87s from 25. In late September it was withdrawn to Stalino to rest and refit. In mid-October, after receiving reinforcements from the Caucasus theatre, the Luftwaffe intensified its efforts. Luftflotte 4 flew 1,250 sorties on 14 October and its Stukas dropped 550 tonnes of bombs. StG 1, 2, and 77 largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before bombing shipping that tried to reinforce the pockets of resistance. The German attacks forced the defenders a strip of land on the western bank;, over 1,208 Stuka missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them. The previous day, II./StG 2 lost its future commander Martin M√∂bus wounded. On 19 November 1942 the Red Army began Operation Uranus, an encirclement operation which encircled the German 6th army and several other Axis armies in Stalingrad. The chaos of the evacuation of Stalingrad, partial elements of II gruppe, either some or all of 6 staffel under the command of Oberleutnant Heinz Jungclausen operated from inside the pocket until December. This unit flew 200 sorties from within Stalingrad. On 1 January 1943 no operational aircraft appeared in the record. After the Raid on Tatsinskaya, the airfield itself fell on 7 January and the group suffered heavy losses in ground personnel. The solitary remaining Ju 87 in 4 staffel was blown up to prevent its capture. StG 2 attempted to provide support for the Romanian 3rd Army and Romanian 4th Army on 21 November, contributing 141 dive bombing missions which cost it five Ju 87s. One group based at Tusov airfield 20 miles west of Kalach, escaped tanks of the 26th Soviet Tank Corps by flying away though other units were caught. Stab., I., and II./StG 2 reported 40 aircraft destroyed‚Äî17 to enemy action, 11 to other causes, six damaged and under repair and six sent to other units. The remainder are not specified in the Quartermaster records or StG 2's war diary. At least 25 Ju 87s were lost or severely damaged in November 1942. On 24 November 1942 another significant loss was Hauptmann Joachim Langbehn, a veteran of 400 combat missions. He was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross. A notable success occurred when Rudel led 1./StG 2 into combat against elements of the 5th Tank Army, 8th Cavalry Corps reached the airfield at Oblivskaya. The last tank was destroyed on the airfield perimeter. I./StG 2 was trapped inside at Karpovka airfield until the site was overrun by Soviet tanks. The group's ground personnel were utilised as infantry. Flying personnel relocated to Morosovskaya, north east of Rostov- on-Don to continue operations in appalling weather conditions. The airfield was abandoned in the face of Soviet advances and five Ju 87s were destroyed by the group. It reported 44 Ju 87s on strength three days earlier and the group relocated to Nikolayev. 700 ground crew from StG 2 were left behind in Stalingrad. They formed an improvised Luftwaffe field battalion and were lost in the destruction of the pocket. The group supported the failed relief effort, Operation Winter Storm. By 25 December 1942 it had been reduced to a dozen operational machines. It scored some tactical successes and inflicted heavy losses on the 25th Tank Corps, the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps and their motorised formations approaching Morosovskaya, due in part to the Red Army advancing beyond air support and the weather improving. One pilot was able to fly nine missions without fearing Soviet fight opposition. III./StG 2 supported the defence of the 2nd Hungarian Army and the Italian 8th Army near Voronezh. The Voronezh Front reached the Oskol River when it came under attack by the group. Knight's Cross winner Siegfried Huber was killed in bad weather conditions, on his 434th combat mission representing the loss of another veteran. Dr Hermann Roer, III./StG 2 noted in his diary, \\"during its operations to ward off attacks against the German lines of defence, 4 staffel became almost obliterated.\\" =Eastern Front 1943: Crimea, Kuban and Kursk= I./StG 2 did not return to Stalingrad. The remnants of the group were based at Samorsk, north of Kalach in the Crimea by 15 February 1943. Operating under Fliegerkorps VIII the formation fought against Soviet advances towards Dnepropetrovsk and the Dnieper River. Elements bombed the Black Sea port of Novorossisk on 27 February and it fought over the Mius and Taganrog front from Stalino, in the Donets Basin. The group also operated in the Kharkov area and around Belgorod in March 1943. In the first half of April 1943, it fought over the Kuban bridgehead, on the Taman Peninsula from Kerch. On 16 April it bombed the beachhead at Novorossisk, where Black Sea Fleet infantry had made an amphibious landing. II./StG 2 supported the same operations, but fought at the Third Battle of Kharkov. From 2 March to 27 June 1943, the group recorded the loss of 15 Ju 87s and one damaged. Nine men were posted missing, three wounded and six killed. III./StG 2 conducted wider ranging operations in 1943. The main body of the group was still at Vyazma but elements fought at Kharkov, then south along the Voronezh, Rossosh and Millerovo. Some staffeln were known to have fought at Third Kharkov. From 1 to 15 April, elements transferred from Poltava to Kerch and operate dover the Kuban bridgehead. The group prevented the advance of Soviet forces through to the Sea of Azov from 5 May. The group used incendiary bombs to burn off reeds and vegetation surrounding the lagoons and swamps to expose Soviet infantry. The group claimed the destruction of 427 small boats. The Soviets abandoned attempts to negotiate the region on 4 July. Nine Ju 87s were reported as destroyed and another two damaged; 9 crew were killed, one wounded and two missing. Ju 87 G-1 \\"Kanonenvogel\\" with its twin Bordkanone underwing gun pods. From 1943, the large numbers of T-34 medium tanks created an urgent need for heavier aerial weapons to destroy them. The German aircraft industry failed to produce a replacement for the Ju 87, which forced its continued use with new weapons. The BK 3,7 cannon was introduced which operated on a remote pneumatic system rather than an electrically sighted mechanism. The weapon showed promise as an armoured-piercing system. The muzzle velocity was 855 metres per second firing a 1.4 kg, 18 tungsten- cored explosive shell. It could penetrate 58 mm of armour at a 60 degree angle of impact at a range of 100 metres and 95mm armour could be penetrated at a range of 600 metres at a 90 degree horizontal trajectory. Further improvements allowed for penetrations of 140 mm of armour at the same range. The weight of the weapon required the wing to be strengthened which led to the Ju 87G-2. StG 2 were involved in loaning their experienced pilots to test the new Ju 87G. Hans-Karl Stepp [commander of StG 2 for the final 18 days of its existence] and Hans-Ulrich Rudel tested the new types. The Experimental Tank Fighting Unit went into battle near Bryansk on 18 March 1943 and accounted for a large number of the 116 Soviet tanks destroyed. Andreas Kuffner and Rudel became well-known and successful tank-busters on Ju 87Gs. In late June and early July 1943, StG 2 moved north to the Kharkov region in preparation for Operation Citadel, the Battle of Kursk. Ernst Kupfer took command of the wing, effective from 13 March 1943. Stab./StG 2 moved to Kharkov-East and was followed by I./StG 2 on 4 July. The group reported 37 Ju 87s on 1 July. II./StG 2 moved to Kharkov-North on 5 July under the command of Hans-Karl Stepp [from 17 June 1943] with 36 Ju 87s. III./StG 2 joined Stab. and I./StG 2 at Kharkov-East with 35 Ju 87s reported on 1 July 1943. StG 2 was engaged in the massive air battles on the southern sector. On 5 July it lost six Stukas. With StG 77, it flew the bulk of the sorties for Fliegerkorps VIII on 8 July; some 701 missions in total. The wing provided close air support to the II SS Panzercorps. On 9 July StG 2 lost five of the six Ju 87s lost by the air corps. The losses of the 9 July was a stark warning to the dive-bomber forces that faced mounting difficulties in daylight operations over contested airspace. From 9 July, the number Stuka sorties fell from over 1,000 on 5 July to 700 to 800 in the following dayes, to half that from 10 July. The wing fought at the Battle of Prokhorovka, but StG 2 and 77 made their weakest contribution to the battle thus far. Only 150 combat sorties were flown between them; compared to 471 the previous day and 1,071 on 5 July. Rudel claimed 12 tanks‚Äîthough his success and tanks kills have been questioned by historians and other German pilots. On 13 and 14 July the wing lost two aircraft on each day. During bombing missions to support the 4th Panzer Army's 2nd SS Panzer Division at the village of Belenikhino, StG 2 lost another veteran, commander of 5./StG 2 Knight's Cross winner G√ºnther Schmid. An irreplaceable veteran of 700 dive-bombing missions died when his Ju 87 exploded in mid-air near Vinogradovka. From 16 July StG 2 covered the German II SS Panzer Corps resisting Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev. II./StG 2 lost three Ju 87s in combat. I. and III./StG 2 were rushed north on 15 July 1943 when a Soviet offensive, Operation Kutuzov threatened to destroy the 9th army and 2nd Panzer Army. Upon third group's arrival the commander Hauptmann Walter Krauss was killed in an air raid on Orel-East on 16/17 July. Rudel succeeded him. Egbert J√§ckel commanding 2./StG 2 was killed later in the day‚Äîanother Knight'sCross winner. The air operations by Fliegerdivision 1, to which StG 2 was attached, succeeded in halting the Western Front's advance. 449 Ju 87 missions were flown on 18 July. SG 1 and SG 2 were heavily involved in the repulse of the Soviet advancement on the Orel-Bryansk communication lines. Staffelkapit√§n Heinz Junclaussen, of 1./StG 2, claimed the cannon-armed Ju 87s inflicted a heavy toll on Soviet armour. The Soviet official history conceded the failure of the 11th Guards Army was due to German aviation. The 1st Tanks Corps had only 33 tanks remaining at the end of the action on 20 July. The following day StG 2 lost another of its irreplaceable Knight's Cross winners. William H√∂rner, commanding 9./StG 2. The cost of the Kursk operations for StG 2 was 30 Ju 87s from 5 to 31 July 1943. Five of the Geschwader's Knight's Cross recipients were killed. =Retreat and disbandment= The Soviet summer offensives drove the Wehrmacht and its allies back into Central Ukraine, from August through to October 1943. I./StG 2 retreated to Karachev by 19 July. From 14 August it operated at Poltava, and then along the Mius front, in the vicinity of Stalino and over Dmitriyevka, 84 km east of Dnepropetrovsk by 29 August. The goup ended operations at Pervomaisk on 18 October 1943. Of the losses recorded, there were seven Ju 87s destroyed and two damaged from 20 August to 18 October 1943. Among the victims was commanding officer, Alwin B√∂rst, wounded in action on 27 September 1943. II./StG 2 remained active over Donets, Nikopol, Zaporozhye and the Kherson bridgehead. From August to October 1943 it recorded eight losses and one damaged. 5./StG commanding officer, Peter Keller was killed on 28 October. The group was uniquely exempted for redesignation in October 1943 and continued to exist as an independent group attached first to Luftflotte 6, then luftflotte 4. In January 1944, 4 and 6./StG 2 departed the front for Neisse in Upper Silesia where they were renamed 10.(PzSG 3 and 10.(Pz)/SG 7 on 7 March 1944. They were re-equipped with the Ju 87G. Nothing is known of the units' activities in November and December 1944. III./StG 2 remained in action supporting the 1st Panzer Army in the Kremenchug and Kirovograd sector in September, and were engaged in bridge attacks in the same regions as II./StG 2. It attacked Soviet bridgeheads along the Dneiper from Stalino to Melitopol. The group was renamed at Kostromka on 18 0ctober 1943.

Located on the eastern side of the Plaza de Armas in Old Havana it is home to the Museum of the City of Havana (Museo de la Ciudad). It houses exhibitions of art and historical artefacts and many of the rooms are preserved with their original Colonial decoration. History Raising the Cuban flag on the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales at noon on May 20, 1902 The plan for the building was put forward to the city council on 28 January 1773 by the governor Felipe de Fondesviela y Ondeano, marqu√©s de la Torre. He proposed that the Parroquial Mayor church be demolished, the square be redesigned in keeping with the grandeur of the developing city and the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales constructed on the eastern side of the square in imitation of Royal Post Office (which would later become the Palacio del Segundo Cabo, the residence of the vice- governors) which had been constructed on the northern side of the square alongside the Castillo de la Real Fuerza. Construction from the designs of the Cuban engineer and architect, Antonio Fern√°ndez de Trebejos y Zald√≠var, who had already been responsible for the much-admired post office, commenced in 1776. Much of the material used in the construction was imported to ensure it was of the finest quality: the bricks from M√°laga, wrought-iron grilles from Bilbao and marble from Genoa, but the building work was carried out by slaves and progressed so slowly that the new governor (the sixth since de Fondesviela), Luis de las Casas y Aragorri, was not able to occupy the building until 1791, and work was not completed until 1792. The building originally housed the governor's residence and a prison, as well as being used as the meeting place for the city council, as the original council offices in Plaza San Francisco had been badly damaged by a hurricane in 1768. The prison, located in the west wing, was closed in 1834. The last of the Colonial governors vacated the palace in 1898 when Cuba gained independence under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, and it was used by the US military governors from 1899 until 1902. It was used as the presidential palace of the Cuban Republic from 1902 until 1920, when the president relocated to the building which now houses the Museum of the Revolution and the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales became once again the offices of the city council. The municipal authorities moved elsewhere in 1967 and in 1968 the palace became the City Museum. Building Palacio de los Capitanes Generales. Havana, Cuba_Floor Plan The building is in the Cuban Baroque style. It is a thick-walled square building, little altered from the time of its original construction. The front of the building has an arcade with arches supported by columns and a pavement made from china pelona. Above the arcade the first storey has a limestone fa√ßade created from local limestone, notable for the numerous marine fossils embedded in the stone. Small balconies extend out from the full length stained-glass windows, level with the top of the columns below. In the centre of the building is an open leafy courtyard overlooked by a gallery on all four sides. The ground floor and mezzanine contain artwork and artefacts from Havana's past. \\"La Giradilla\\", a statue that became the symbol of the city, and was originally located on the tower of the nearby Castillo de la Real Fuerza, stands at the foot of the stairs leading to the mezzanine. The Cenotaph, the oldest colonial monument in Cuba, taken from the original Parroquial Mayor church, is on display in one of the rooms on the lower floor, and another room houses relics from the Espada Cemetery, including the tomb of the French artist Jean Baptiste Vermay. The Espada Cemetery was the first cemetery in the city, founded by Juan Jos√© Diaz de Espada in 1806. Also on display are some of the original stone baths in the shape of a nautilus shell and a 19th-century fire engine manufactured in London. On the top floor the rooms of the governor's residence are preserved with much of the original furniture and decoration. The Hall of Heroic Cuba contains important objects from the wars of independence and many flags of national significance including the flag of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, the \\"Father of the Homeland\\" (Padre de la Patria). The building also houses the Office of the City Historian, headed by Eusebio Leal, which is responsible for the renovation work in Old Havana.

Life Jones was born at Goginan, Cardiganshire, and educated at Lewis School, Pengam, and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He subsequently studied natural sciences at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1899 and MA in 1903. In 1904 he was admitted to D. Sc. of University of London. On 1 August 1912 Jones married a colleague, Muriel Gwendolen Edwards, a keen climber and the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the University of Wales.\\"Jones the compound\\", BBC. Retrieved 7 November 2011 Chemist In 1901 he obtained an official appointment of demonstrator to the Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy, Sir James Dewar, which he held up to the time of his death. He was elected in due course (1902) to a Fellowship at Clare College where he subsequently became lecturer. For eleven years Jones devoted most of his time to teaching in the university laboratory and to the supervision of the science students of his college. His scientific advice extended to students outside his college, such as Annie Homer at Newnham College. Beyond this work with students, Jones was one of the most productive British chemists of his day and published more than 60 papers between 1900 and 1912. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Jones had not visited foreign laboratories and even other English Universities. He gained his research experience entirely at Cambridge, working with Dewar and Fenton. With the latter he carried out his first experimental investigation on the \\"oxidation of organic acids in the presence of iron\\" (1900), and in 1904 prepared his own work on the stereochemistry of nitrogen. In 1907 and in 1909 he wrote the section on stereochemistry for the annual reports of the Chemical Society. The study of organic nitrogen bases led to his attempt to solve the difficult problem of the constitution and transformations of the aldol bases derived from the homologues of aniline. Meanwhile, Jones was assisting Dewar in very different investigations of the metallic (nickel and iron) carbonyls. These researches had made Jones familiar with low temperature manipulations and ultimately led to their discovery of carbon monosulfide. In this way Jones' attention was directed to organic sulphur compounds, particularly thio- oxalates, thiomalonates and thiophosphates. His eminence as an investigator was recognised in his election to the Royal Society in 1912. In the same year he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines. Mountaineering In 1907, Jones became a keen climber after receiving some tuition in Snowdonia.Welsh Biography Online He went on to pioneer some of the most difficult climbs in that region, such as Paradise on Lliwedd, which he put up in 1909. His sister, Bronwen Ceridwen Jones (later Mawson), was also an accomplished climber. Together with Karl Blodig, Geoffrey Winthrop Young and the guide Josef Knubel of St Niklaus he made the first ascent of the Brouillard ridge to the summit of Mont Blanc on 9 August 1911. He thoroughly explored the Mont Blanc region and put up many new routes there. Already a member of the Committee of the Climbers' Club, in 1909 he was elected a member of the Alpine Club.

Davison was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He completed his studies in music at Harvard University, finally graduating in 1908 with a PhD. He is best remembered as an academic for his work as editor of the two volumes of 'The Historical Anthology of Music', done together with Willi Apel. He died in Brant Rock. Davison was also the first conductor of the Harvard Glee Club, which under his direction, from 1920 to 1933, came to be regarded as the best amateur chorus in the U.S. Davison (known as \\"Doc\\"), transformed the Glee Club from a small, informal, and rowdy group that performed popular tunes to a more serious group, which toured the U.S. performing a more serious repertory: > By the end of the ‚Äòteens, HGC was singing sacred and secular pieces from the > renaissance times till the present, folk songs from around the world, and > college songs and had ceased its relationships with the mandolin clubs and > popular music. The Glee Club would go on to introduce modern French works scored for men's chorus, especially those of Poulenc and Milhaud to their repertories and to audiences around the United States. The group would tour the United States and, along with the Radcliffe Choral Society began performing regularly with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, an association that would continue into the 1970s. Davison's goals in directing the Glee Club were both artistic and educational: under his direction, the Glee Club grew much larger, in order to introduce more students to the music and to the practice of performance. Some (including The New York Times) criticized the resulting performance style, but it was a direct result of the Glee Club's dual purpose, which remains to this day. As a result, the Harvard Glee Club went on to become a premier training ground for conductors, directors and other music professionals. Davison also composed his own music early in life, but none of his original compositions are part of the standard repertoire. His arrangements have been more widely performed, including an arrangement of Webbe's Glorious Apollo, performed regularly by the HGC.

It is housed in the former Mechanics' Institute built by Cuthbert Brodrick, in Cookridge Street (now Millennium Square), which has been redeveloped to a design by Austin-Smith:Lord architects and Buro Happold engineers. Gallery and exhibit design is provided by Redman Design. It one of nine sites in the Leeds Museums & Galleries group. Admission to the museum is free of charge. Special exhibitions are hosted alongside a collection of displays from the Leeds Archive.  History  In 1819, a museum was established in Philosophical Hall, Bond Street, by the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society, and in 1821 it opened to the public. In 1921, control of the museum was handed to the Corporation of Leeds which later became Leeds City Council. In 1862, Philosophical Hall was rebuilt in Park Row, where its stone portico can still be seen on the west side of the road.Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society: About the society In 1941, the museum building and artifacts were badly damaged by bombing. In 1965 the museum was closed, and a few exhibits removed to a couple of rooms in the city library in 1966. The oversized Leeds Tiger, the giant moose skeleton and the carved wooden cart took up much of the space. In 1999 the museum went into storage, though researchers and the public could view items by appointment. In 2000, the resource centre at Yeadon opened, under the same appointment-to-view arrangement. In 2001, Leeds City Council bid for National Lottery cash, and in 2004, it was awarded ¬£19.5 million, so in 2005, the Leeds Mechanics' Institute building began to be redesigned as Leeds City Museum, finally to reopen in 2008.Yorkshirepost.co.uk article: Long-awaited new museum set to go down in city's history Chris Bond, 12 September 2008.  The exhibits  While exhibits vary, they are mainly made up of exhibits from Leeds' history. The central hall has a large map of Leeds printed on the floor. There is also a scale model of the Quarry Hill flats. The exhibits are organised among several galleries. = Life on Earth gallery = This is the natural history gallery, featuring everything from a meteorite to dinosaur poo (coprolite). In 2019, the skeleton of a Long-finned Pilot Whale was hung from the ceiling just outside the gallery.  Leeds Tiger  Leeds City Museum's \\"Leeds Tiger\\". A large mounted Bengal tiger A large, stuffed Bengal tiger, this exhibit came to Leeds in 1862. It was shot by Colonel Charles Reid in Dehra Dun, Utta Pradesh, India in March, 1860. It was originally exhibited at the London International Exhibition as a tiger rug - hence its odd shape - before being turned into a taxidermy mount by Henry Ward. The Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society commissioned Ward to do this work and it has been on display to the people of Leeds almost continuously for over 150 years. The tiger was one of the foremost attractions in Leeds as soon as it was exhibited. At the annual conversazione of the Leeds Philosophical Society in 1863, the Reverend T. Hincks stated that \\"he was afraid that the tiger ... had been too much the great lion ... and that they had neglected many other noble beasts surrounding it.\\" This exhibit - so beloved of the Leeds populace - has a strange history. It was a tiger skin rug when purchased for ¬£90 and presented to the Museum by William Gott in the 19th century. The present exhibit was likely constructed of more than one tiger skin because: \\"researcher Ebony Andrews believes that the skin might have been trimmed after it was tanned, leaving missing sections underneath the tiger's chin, neck and up all four legs.\\" Museum records give the impression that the tiger had been shot for spending too much time near a village in India. Meanwhile, the story of a tiger shot for its mere presence at the edge of a village became a legend of the killer of one man, then of two people, then the serial killer of forty. This myth may have developed following a 1906 guidebook by Henry Crowther, which said it \\"destroyed forty bullocks in six weeks and was considered so formidable that no native dare venture into the jungle where this noble beast reigned supreme.\\" The Yorkshire Evening Post said, \\"We'll never know for certain whether the Leeds Tiger really lived up to its dangerous reputation, but today it sends a shiver down the spines of visitors to Leeds City Museum.\\" However the pelt may now be dangerous after all, in a sense, as the Victorians will have preserved it with arsenical soap.Chestofbooks.com webpage: Arsenical soap. For over a century it has sagged somewhat, as can be seen in the photograph. Nevertheless, in the early 1860s the tiger was considered an object of beauty: > The setting up of this tiger is so natural and so perfect in posture and > anatomical detail, that it is certainly to be looked upon as a work of art > quite as much as an object for scientific observation ... Professor Owen > has more than once stated that it is the finest and largest animal of its > species not only in England but in Europe. It has been said that the tiger was \\"saved from the curators' skip by the Yorkshire Post when it mounted a successful campaign to retain it as a popular centrepiece of the museum's collection\\" but the museum's curator was quoted in 1979 as saying: = Ancient Worlds gallery = Roman floor mosaic Hellenistic Greek tomb door Here are archaeological items from Leeds and around the world. * Roman floor mosaic ca 250 CE, depicting she-wolf with Romulus and Remus. This was discovered at Aldborough (Yorkshire), known to the Romans as Isurium Brigantum. * Hellenistic Greek tomb doors ca 250 BCE. These are carved in marble, in bas relief. * The Leeds Mummy. In the 1941 bombing raids, two other mummies were destroyed, but Nesyamun's 3000-year-old mummy survived. It is displayed in the current museum building, alongside a rather striking reconstruction of his face.24dash.com: Sting in the tale of Leeds mummy, by Hannah Wooderson, 3 September 2008. * Iron replica of Hellenistic Greek head of Aphrodite. This is a cast replica of the original 1st century BCE head in the British Museum. The original was discovered in 1872 at Satala (now Sadak) in north-eastern Turkey. The eyes were once inlaid with precious stones or paste. Apparently the top of the head was not designed to be empty, like a piece of modern art. It seems that the farmer found it when he hit the top of the head with his axe and damaged it.Britishmuseum.org: Bronze head of a goddess, probably Aphrodite. = World View gallery = In 2014 this gallery began hosting a long-term exhibition called 'Voices of Asia', which celebrates the sights, sounds and culture of Asian communities here in Leeds and around the world. The 'faith' element of the display regularly changes. From 2017, the focus was on Buddhism. Leeds Museums & Galleries has large collection of objects from around the world, and Voices of Asia displays just one aspect of the city's holdings. The Leeds African collections are also significant, especially the sculpture, masks and textiles. Since 2019, most are held at Leeds Discovery Centre, where you will also find good representations of North American beadwork, European folk items and the traditional arts of Oceania. = Leeds Story gallery = The history of Leeds from prehistory to the modern day.

He is especially notable for his work and achievements in Antarctica. Career B√©chervaise was educated in Melbourne. He joined Geelong College in 1935 in order to establish a program of outdoor activities for the boys. During the years of the Second World War he studied art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, but returned to Geelong College after the war. In January 1949 he led a mountaineering expedition of the Geelong College Exploration Society to climb the hitherto unclimbed 1224 m Federation Peak in Tasmania. He also led the first party to land Tasmania's Rodondo Island in Bass Strait, 10 km off the coast of Victoria. As well as contributing to the development of outdoor education in Victoria, he was for many years the assistant editor of the Australian magazine Walkabout. =Antarctic= In the 1950s B√©chervaise joined the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE). He served as field leader on Heard Island in 1953, leading an unsuccessful expedition to climb the 2745 m Mawson Peak of the Big Ben massif, the highest peak on Australian territory. He also served as station leader at Mawson Station, Antarctica in 1955 and 1959. From there he led field trips of up to 600 km inland, exploring MacRobertson Land and the Prince Charles Mountains region. He was awarded the Polar Medal for this exploration work. B√©chervaise visited American Antarctic bases in 1966 as an Australian observer with Operation Deep Freeze. John B√©chervaise returned to the Antarctic on MV Nanok S on her first trip south with ANARE in the summer of 1979‚Äì80 which also carried a large contingent of naval personnel. B√©chervaise provided his knowledge to the Naval contingent. B√©chervaise Island (or 'Bech' to locals), was named on 1 January 2000 in his honour. It is the largest, central island of the Flat Islands, about 2 km WNW of Mawson Station. B√©chervaise was a highly respected teacher at Geelong Grammar School during the 1960s and early 1970s. He gave many lectures detailing adventures in Antarctica as well as similar escapades in Europe, an altogether inspirational teacher for those lucky enough to be his students. For three weeks in Lent 1963 when he went to the Antarctic islands on the Magga Dan, his lessons were taken by a British student Peter Bottomley, now Sir Peter Bottomley MP. Family B√©chervaise was married to Lorna Fearn Wannan; the couple had one son and three daughters. His family had come from Jersey in the 19th century where there is still a Bechervaise Lane. His great-great-grandfather who came from Jersey and had the same name received the 1818‚Äì1855 British Arctic Medal and published an anonymous memoir Thirty-Six Years of a Seafaring life by An old Quartermaster in 1839. Copies are in the British Library and Caird Library in Greenwich and it is available in facsimile from several publishers. Some sources misspell his name Berchervaise.

Mind Styles Model and Gregorc Style Delineator The Gregorc Style Delineator is a self-scoring written instrument that elicits responses to a set of 40 specific words.

Additionally, Dog Years played at the 1998 South by Southwest film festival. In 2003, Robert Loomis directed Angry Young Man, the sequel to Dog Years, once again starring R. Michael Caincross. Plot The film revolves around the lonely Wally, a Trojan skinhead whose only friend is his beloved Dalmatian Neechee. One day while walking her, Wally accidentally becomes involved with a strange deal gone bad when he bumps into a fleeing stranger being chased by a group of mob thugs. When he gets tangled up in Neechee's leash and frantically kicks the dog, Wally proceeds to beat him up and gets arrested by passing police officers. The dealer gets away and Wally spends a night in jail. Upon being released, he learns that his dog has been kidnapped by the mob thugs, who are convinced Wally's holding the drugs that have been taken from them. Although he quickly proves that he's innocent, the mob's still not letting him off that easily: either he'll have to do some work for them, or both he and the dog are dead. Reluctantly, Wally agrees to run some illegal errands.

The hearing aid acoustically amplifies low frequencies, while the cochlear implant electrically stimulates the middle and high frequencies. The inner ear processes acoustic and electric stimuli simultaneously. The results of international studies have shown a highly synergistic effect between hearing aid and cochlear implant technology, particularly evident in speech understanding in noise, pitch discrimination and music appreciation.  Introduction  Electric stimulation of the auditory system via cochlear implant is a commonly used technique for individuals with a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, as well as for those adults and children with some residual hearing. Individuals suffering from mild to moderate hearing loss can usually benefit from hearing aids. This acoustic stimulation proves to be particularly effective in the low frequencies, though a severe hearing loss (> 70 dB HL) above 1 kHz can be beyond the range of amplification possible via acoustic stimulation. Electric stimulation (CI), on the other hand, is capable of providing high-frequency information up to 8 kHz. The concept of combining simultaneous electric- acoustic stimulation (EAS) for the purposes of better hearing was first described by C. von Ilberg and J. Kiefer, from the Universit√§tsklinik Frankfurt, Germany, in 1999. That same year the first EAS patient was implanted.  Indications  There is a certain patient group that has some degree of residual hearing in the low frequencies and a severe hearing loss in the high frequencies. This group only receives limited benefits from traditional amplification because of the severity of the hearing loss in the high frequencies. They suffer from inadequate speech comprehension, even in the best aided condition. Nor are they classic cochlear implant candidates, because of their mostly intact low frequency residual hearing. The indications for EAS are based on the following three considerations: # Audiogram # Speech scores # Additional selection criteria = Audiogram = below 1.5 kHz ‚Äì No or moderate HL above 1.5 kHz ‚Äì Severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment = Speech scores = The patient's monosyllable word score should be ‚â§ 60% at 65 dB SPL in the best aided condition. = Additional selection criteria = Contraindicated are: * Progressive hearing loss * Autoimmune disease * Hearing loss as a result of meningitis, otosclerosis or ossification * Malformation or obstruction of the cochlea * Air‚Äìbone gap > 15 dB HL * External ear contra-indications to using amplification devices  Hearing preservation surgery  A special surgical technique is the key to preserving the residual hearing of the patient. In most routine cochlear implant surgeries, any residual hearing will likely be destroyed. Important factors for preserving residual hearing are: * Special atraumatic soft electrodes * Smallest possible acoustic trauma due to cochleostomy drilling * Smallest possible mechanical trauma due to drilling and electrode insertion * Avoidance of inflammatory and fibrotic reactions (contamination with blood, bone dust, middle ear bacteria, etc.) * The use of drugs that will aid in the preservation of hearing Two methods are commonly used for inserting the electrode into the cochlea: * Round-window insertion * Cochleostomy insertion Most recently, round-window insertion has found a wider acceptance because it is considered to be less traumatic. The best results have been achieved with electrode insertion depths of 18 mm, which corresponds to the approximate place in the normal sized cochlea where 1000 Hz is processed. As a result, frequencies below 1000 Hz are stimulated acoustically, and above 1000 Hz are stimulated electrically. For those interested in gaining the latest expertise necessary for a successful treatment of EAS candidates, surgical and professional training courses are provided by companies that offer EAS products.  EAS electrodes for cochlear implants  Long-term research has shown that mechanical flexibility of the electrode array is one of the key factors for preserving residual hearing. The smaller the force used to insert the electrode, the greater the chance of protecting the fragile structures within the cochlea. Today only lateral wall electrodes are used. Studies with preshaped (modiolus-hugging electrodes) have been proven to be not so effective. Studies with different lengths of electrodes have shown that an insertion depth of 10 mm has a good chance of preserving residual hearing but on the other hand yields little benefit in speech understanding in comparison to the hearing aid only condition. Electrodes that can be inserted to a depth of 18‚Äì22 mm are a good compromise. The insertion depth also depends on the size of the cochlea of the patient, though a range of 18‚Äì22 mm can be used as a general rule of thumb for insertion in most cochleas.  EAS audio processors  Comparison of a black standard processor for CI and a gray version for electric acoustic stimulation. EAS audio processor with ear mould worn by user. Several devices are under investigation; however there is only one approved device currently available that combines cochlear implant technology with a digital hearing aid. This device uses one microphone for the input, but has two separate digital sound processors for differentiated processing. The parallel processing of these signals, however, is performed separately and optimized for both acoustic hearing (focusing on low-frequency hearing) and cochlear implant stimulation (focusing on high-frequency hearing). The hearing aid is integrated in the ear hook and the amplified signals are forwarded to the auditory pathway via an ear mould. The ear mould used for the acoustic component is similar to a conventional hearing aid ear mould and can be exchanged.

Overview The weapon consists of a Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser- equipped SUU-66/B Tactical Munitions Dispenser containing 3,750 non-explosive steel and tungsten penetrator rods of various sizes. There is no other version of the CBU-107. The weapon is notable for the speed with which it was developed and fielded, a total of 98 days. This was to meet an urgent operation requirement and earned the development team several awards. The CBU-107 is designed to perform effects based warfare, where a strategically valuable battlefield ‚Äúeffect‚Äù is achieved without having to damage large portions of the infrastructure in the attacked area. The penetrating rods range in size from several inches to over a foot long and can disable targets like fuel tanks, antennas, or even a helicopter without necessarily harming nearby people. The effect of a PAW rod impacting is similar to that of an armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot penetrator fired from a tank gun; if they are released from a high enough altitude to reach terminal velocity, they release a large amount of heat in a confined area extremely fast that vaporizes and melts through the small area. Combat history The CBU-107 was first used in an attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Information on March 28, 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

History Former bank building in Forreston Another long opened business in Forreston Forreston Cemetery is located south of the community. The roots of Forreston date to 1843, when the area was known as Howe's Settlement, named for an early settler in the region. In the middle to late 1840s, the community was renamed Chambers Creek. It received its first post office in 1846. It initially served as the original county seat of Navarro County until 1850, when the organization of Ellis County placed the town within the new county. From the early 1850s to the late 1880s, Chambers Creek remained a small farming community, providing a school and a church for local residents and farmers. In 1890, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (KATY) Railroad was built through the area, and businesses began to spring up along the tracks. The community was renamed Forreston, after Carr Forrest, a local landowner who served as the first postmaster and donated the land on which the new rail depot was built. By the 1940s, Forreston had three cotton gins, several businesses, and a population of 350. Throughout the 20th century the town remained a shipping point for local farming and commerce. The population declined; by 2000, it had only some two hundred residents. Forreston was featured in the March 1999 issue of Texas Monthly in the article entitled \\"The Best of Small-Town Texas\\". In August 2007, Forreston was featured in \\"Shop Vintage with Ken Weber\\" in the publication, D Magazine.

It is the fourth in a series of films starring the title character, a top secret government agent and supermodel. The original three films (collectively titled RuPaul Is: Starbooty!) were all made in the mid-1980s by RuPaul and his friends with a budget of around $100, and were sold out of shopping carts around gay bars in Atlanta, Georgia. Plot The film's plot combines several elements from these original films. Starrbooty (RuPaul) is in the middle of a major karate fight when she receives a phone call informing her that her adopted niece Cornisha has been kidnapped. With the help of fellow crime fighter Agent Page Turner, Starrbooty learns that her nemesis Annaka Manners is using her billion-dollar cosmetics company as a front for kidnapping prostitutes and selling their organs on the black market. Starrbooty also discovers that Annaka is actually her long-lost sister, making Cornisha Annaka's daughter. Page and Starrbooty go undercover as prostitutes (as Pepper and Cupcake, respectively) and in order to be convincing enough to infiltrate Annaka's inner sanctum, they go \\"all the way\\" (this includes numerous sex scenes with explicit male nudity, generally designed for laughs). When Starrbooty finally confronts Annaka she discovers that Cornisha was in on the plot all along, and has become Annaka's lover. Informing them that they are actually mother and daughter, Starrbooty reveals Annaka's plans to double- cross Cornisha by selling her clitoris to a wealthy socialite (in one of the more memorable jokes, Annaka is also planning to sell Starrbooty's long legs to a \\"famous female rapper,\\" quipping, \\"I guess they won't call her 'Lil' anymore!\\"). A final showdown between Starrbooty and Annaka leaves Annaka dead, and they are able to salvage Cornisha's genitals by taking Annaka's (a perfect biological match). Thus everyone who deserves to lives happily ever after.

The DVD title is Starrbooty: The Movie. The film is an homage to blaxploitation and sexploitation films of the 1960s and 1970s. In an article for EdgePhiladelphia, RuPaul stated, \\"The goal was to make an exploitation film that was part Russ Meyer, part John Waters and part The Naked Gun.\\"EdgePhiladelphia The film utilizes things like obvious vocal overdubbing, grainy footage and dramatic cuts to mimic these low-budget films of the past. Screenings and reception The film began screening at various gay and lesbian film festivals in July 2007. RuPaul presented the film in person at each screening, often with other cast members. Erik Schut of The Philly Film Guide said \\"Starrbooty is a fried, dyed and laid to the side-splitting kick- ass good time!\\" It was the only film at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival to be sold out at both screenings. The movie's supporting cast is primarily made up of pornographic film stars, both male and female. It is unrated, and though there is no explicit sex, it does feature several of its male stars frontally nude and erect, and at one point RuPaul is depicted graphically fondling a man's penis. Though this is primarily played for comic effect, it is a marked departure from the \\"Drag Queen Next Door\\" image RuPaul cultivated during the height of her fame. The film ends with an on-screen dedication to Jerry Falwell. The DVD was released October 30, 2007. There was no distribution deal reached, and thus it was released by RuPaul under the imprint \\"Starbooty, Inc.\\" Soundtrack Starrbooty: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released June 20, 2017. # Call Me Starrbooty # The Call (Interlude) # A Fistful Of Booty # Damn You Annaka!

Growing in swampy or waterlogged soils, it is up to high with thick spongy reddish brown bark and dark green broad leaves, which help form a dense canopy. The white to cream flowers appear in autumn and winter. The leaves are commonly eaten by insects, and are a food item for the koala. It is an important winter-flowering species in eastern Australia, and has been planted extensively in many countries around the world. Its timber is used for firewood and in general construction. Description Eucalyptus robusta grows commonly as a straight, upright tree to around tall, with a trunk up to in diameter at breast height (dbh). The trunk and branches are covered with thick red-brown bark, which has a spongy feel and is stringy‚Äîpeeling in longitudinal strips. The long irregular branches spread laterally, and form a dense canopy with the broad green leaves. Arranged alternately along the stems, these measure long by wide. Adult leaves are broadly lanceolate to ovate, green and glossy, and with closely spaced \\"feather-like\\" side veins running at greater than 45¬∞ angle to the main midrib. The white or cream flowers are clustered in inflorescences of from 7 to 13 flowers. The flowers appear anywhere from March to September, and peak over May and June. Retrieved 12-24-2011. The buds measure wide and are distinctive in that the operculum has a prominent long beak, making them fusiform (spindle-shaped). Retrieved 11 April 2012. The woody fruits are cylindrical-shaped, 1 to 1.6 cm long by 0.7 to 1.1 cm wide, pedicellate with descending disc and 3 to 4 valves at rim level or slightly exserted. Seeds are light-brown to yellow to 1.8mm long, pyramidal or obliquely pyramidal in shape. The bangalay (E. botryoides) is similar in appearance, but its flower buds are smaller with a conical operculum and only grow in groups of seven. The fruits are smaller and sessile, rather than on stalks. The name E. robusta is derived from the Latin robustus (robust), and refers to the appearance of the tree species. Taxonomy E. robusta by James Sowerby, from James Edward Smith's 1793 A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland Specimens of E. robusta were first collected by First Fleet surgeon and naturalist John White, and the species description was published by James Edward Smith in his 1793 collaboration with George Shaw, Zoology and Botany of New Holland. Shortly afterwards, the description was reprinted verbatim in Smith's A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland, and it is this publication that is usually credited. Smith gave it the specific epithet robusta (\\"robust\\") in reference to the size and strength of the full-grown tree. The common name of swamp mahogany comes from its preferred habitat of swamps, and its timber's likeness to that of West Indies mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). Eucalyptus robusta is known as the swamp messmate in Queensland. Swamp stringybark is another common name, and Gulgong and Gnorpin are old names recorded. It is called robusta eucalyptus in the United States, beakpod eucalyptus in Puerto Rico, and mkaratusi in Swahili. Eucalyptus robusta belongs to a group of eight species of spongy red-barked gum trees known as red mahoganies in the section Annulares, and is closely related to the bangalay and red mahogany (E. resinifera). It is distinguished from them by its larger flowers and fruit. The latter species grows in dryer habitats. Eucalyptus robusta often hybridises with forest red gum (E. tereticornis), the resulting plants having been given the name E. patentinervis. Hybrids reported with other species include bangalay, flooded gum (E. grandis), Tasmanian blue gum (E. globulus), woollybutt (E. longifolia) and Bancroft's red gum (E. bancroftii). Distribution and habitat This species occurs in swamps and alongside estuaries in a narrow coastal strip, usually within a few kilometres of the ocean, from Rockhampton, Queensland south to Jervis Bay, New South Wales. It is also found offshore on Great Keppel, Moreton, Fraser and North and South Stradbroke Islands. It is widely planted as a timber tree, and is considered to be invasive in Hawaii and R√©union,Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) Species info: Eucalyptus robusta. Retrieved 2009-11-02. and has become naturalised in Florida. It generally grows on heavy clay soils, but is also found on sandy clay and alluvial sand soils. It grows on sand on offshore islands. Found from sea level to altitudes of above sea level, it grows in swamps or areas where the water table is high, generally fresh or brackish in nature. Older plants are able to tolerate salt but seedlings cannot. Eucalyptus robusta can also grow in highly acidic sulphate estuarine soils with a pH as low as 2.5. It is a dominant tree in swamp forests, often growing in pure stands or with other trees such as red mahogany (E. resinifera), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia), swamp sheoak (Casuarina glauca), snow-in-summer (Melaleuca linariifolia), swamp paperbark (M. ericifolia) and, less commonly, forest red gum (E. tereticornis). Ecology A long-lived tree, Eucalyptus robusta can live for at least two hundred years. Trees regenerate by regrowing from epicormic buds on the trunk after bushfire. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) eats the flowers, and the koala (Phascalarctos cinereus) eats the leaves. Eucalyptus robusta appears to be one of several key species of eucalypt for the koala in the Shire of Noosa in Queensland. The musk lorikeet feeds on the nectar of the blossoms. It is a keystone species on the New South Wales Central Coast and Illawarra regions, where it is one of few reliable winter-flowering plants. Stands of E. robusta have been drastically reduced by land clearance. Some remnant trees in Robson Park in the Sydney suburb of Haberfield are the last vestiges of the Sydney Coastal Estuary Swamp Forest Complex community in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Insects, such as psyllids and Christmas beetles from the genus Anoplognathus and the eucalyptus chafer (Xylonychus eucalypti) commonly eat the leaves. The rectangular-lerp forming psyllid Glycaspis siliciflava eats only this species. The scale insects Brachyscelis munita and Opisthoscelis pisiformis form galls. The adult double drummer cicada (Thopha saccata) lives in the tree, while larvae of the small staghorn beetle species Ceratognathus froggattii and another beetle Moechidius rugosus live and pupate within the thick bark. The wood-moth (Aenetus splendens) makes a thick bag-like structure around a branch where it breeds. The beetle species Maecolaspis favosa attacks the leaves in Florida. Eucalyptus robusta plantations in Madagascar are host to prolific numbers of mushrooms, some of which are edible and widely consumed. Two species of the genus Russula ‚Äì Russula prolifica and R. madecassense ‚Äì and several as yet undescribed species of chanterelle of the genus Cantharellus are sold in markets and eaten. The appearance of R. prolifica is enigmatic, as it has only become abundant in the past seventy years, and is unknown in Australia. Introduced Eucalyptus robusta trees developed ectomycorrhizal associations in the Seychelles, with a high correlation with local tree species Vateriopsis seychellarum and ipil (Intsia bijuga), seemingly gaining these relationships from those species. Uses Tree planted 1813, Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney Eucalyptus robusta adapts well to cultivation, though it often grows too large for home gardens. It has been used as a street tree, and is useful in public areas with wet soils. It can grow very quickly in cultivation and flower profusely. It can flower in its third year of growth in cultivation in optimal conditions. Birds are attracted to its flower heads. However, in some years its leaves are infested with lerps and detract from its appearance. A row of E. robusta was planted at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney in 1813, and the trees are still healthy. A cultivar with variegated leaves, E. robusta \\"Green and Gold\\" was commercially available in 2005 in Australia. It is smaller than the wild form, reaching in height. Eucalyptus robusta is widely grown from equatorial to temperate regions, tolerating a wide range of climates and conditions. Its fast early growth and tolerance for waterlogging have rendered it a useful tree to grow. It has been widely grown in plantations outside Australia, including Argentina, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Fiji, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Philippines, Puerto Rico, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan‚ÄîRepublic of China, Tanzania, Uganda, Zanzibar, and the United States of America, where it has been grown in Hawaii, southern Florida, southern California and Puerto Rico. Introduction to Florida took place around 1880, Hawaii around 1885, and Puerto Rico in 1929. The tree is used for firewood and as charcoal in many countries, in erosion control, on sand dunes and as a roadside shade tree in many places, and in Uganda is used to drain swamps. Plantation crops are harvested after 4‚Äì5 years for fuel wood, 8‚Äì10 years for pulp wood, 15‚Äì20 years for poles and 30‚Äì60 years for logs for sawing. In cultivation, E. robusta grows to altitudes of , withstanding average minimum temperatures of and maxima of . The heartwood is extremely durable and resists marine borers. It is used as a round timber for construction of wharves and fencing. The wood is light reddish brown in colour and coarse-textured. The weight can vary widely between individuals and stands, averaging 38 pounds per cubic foot.

The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. The term program is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a synonym of, an \\"architectural brief\\". \\"Program\\" is used more often in the United States whereas \\"brief\\" is used internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program. Development of the brief The architectural brief is often formulated by, or in collaboration with, the architect. It often includes opportunities assessed, constraints identified and needs for further investigation clarified. In the early stages of the design process the brief may be continuously reappraised as the requirements become clearer - this is known as 'firming up the brief'. Ultimately, a clear set of instructions setting out the overarching goals and detailed requirements will emerge which form the starting point of the architect's designs and will be continually tested against, as designs are progressed. Schedule of accommodation In the later stages of writing a brief, a schedule of accommodation is sometimes drawn up that will specify precisely the number and size of rooms that will be required, the relationships between rooms and groups of rooms, the finishes, equipment, furniture that will fit the room for its functional purpose and the environmental conditions that will assist the purpose. Environmental conditions might include temperature range, humidity, air movement, acoustic isolation, etc..The schedule of accommodation is prepared by an expert to help in determining the minimum space required on site to develop and finish a given design. The schedule of accommodation is guided by the brief analysis of every space since every space have set standards and requirement. Complex briefs For complex facilities, the brief may be prepared by a specialist consultant, separate from the design architect. In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, facility experts, builders/contractors and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief. If the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made. The information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs. Parameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor loading, floor finish and skirting requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, air-conditioning, water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety. A thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub- functions and then to activities. A 'functional brief' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options. Evaluation For critical facilities, the project manager or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief. This avoids misunderstanding of drawings that can arise when non-experts are asked to review them. A graphical validation might include demonstration of the movement expected between spaces, and show how a proximity diagram is modeled onto the design layout.

He initially wrestled under his own surname of Yamada. After a long apprenticeship in the junior ranks he achieved senior sekitori status in May 2001 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division. To mark the occasion he changed his shikona to Wakatoba. After a 10-5 record at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 4 in July 2003 he was promoted to the top makuuchi division. An 8-7 mark in his top division debut saw him promoted to his highest rank of maegashira 11. He fought in the top division for a total of seven tournaments. In March 2005 he was transferred to Oguruma stable when Oshiogawa stable shut down. He was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç in March 2006 and after pulling out of the January 2007 tournament after only five days with an injury to his left leg he was relegated to the unsalaried ranks. Retirement After the May 2007 tournament it was reported that Wakatoba had retired, and he was quoted as saying he had lost his will to continue, and that his most memorable match was one against Terao. However, he subsequently denied that he had retired, and he competed in the following tournament in July. However, after that tournament, having fallen to the rank of makushita 57, he did retire and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under his old stablemaster's name of Oshiogawa the following month. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held in February 2008, and he introduced his fianc√© at the event. He worked as a coach at Oguruma stable until leaving the Sumo Association in August 2010. This move coincided with the death of the previous Oshiogawa, and the Oshiogawa stock was obtained by Takekaze. In June 2018 he was featured in TBS Television's The Friday, working alongside fellow ex-sumo wrestlers Wakanojo and Wakatenro, in care for the elderly.

Warren's previous clubs include Wrexham FC and Cobh Ramblers. Warren also once scored a double hat trick in a league match for Cobh Ramblers. Club career Warren took his first football steps with local club Mayfield United as a stylish central midfielder. He was quickly groomed and was part of the Republic of Ireland Under 16 squad that won the UEFA Under-16 Championships in 1998. In 2000, he moved to Welsh side Wrexham but after two frustrating seasons during which he made just six League appearances for The Robins. The financial troubles that beset the Football League meant that Warren was released by Wrexham in 2002 and he returned to his hometown club Cork City along with the likes of George O'Callaghan and John O'Flynn. At Turner's Cross, Warren struggled for form and moved on loan to Cobh . There he impressed under then-manager Dave Hill who made the move to St Colman's Park permanent. After a successful spell at Cobh, Warren moved to League of Ireland Premier Division side Waterford United in 2007.  First Division Record  Warren scored nine goals in four matches during October 2004, including six goals in an 8-1 victory over Monaghan United. A new First Division record, Warren is only the third player to score six goals in one League match in the last 50 years. Jonathan Speak (Derry City) and Brendan Bradley (Finn Harps) are the other two to have managed such an achievement. He won the Player of the Month on the back of this record breaking achievement.

Almost immediately consolidation was put into action and Lincoln County High School was built. About the School Lincoln County High School's colors are Carolina blue, black, and silver. Its current principal is Mr. Tab Mathis. Its mascot is the panther. The student population is 842 or so. The school offers many sports such as football, cheerleading, soccer, volleyball, golf, wrestling, basketball, tennis, softball, baseball, and track.

He was also a competent amateur painter. A school friend of Paul C√©zanne's in Aix-en- Provence, Marion went on to become professor and director of the Natural History Museum in Marseille. C√©zanne painted his portrait in 1866‚Äì1867 at the Bastide du Jas de Bouffan. He received his higher education in Marseille, earning his arts and letters degree in 1866 and his degree in sciences in 1868. In 1878 he opened a marine laboratory with financial assistance provided by the city of Marseille, which led in 1882 to the building of the Marine Station of Endoume. In 1880 he became director of the Mus√©um d‚Äôhistoire naturelle de Marseille. He was a good friend of Gaston de Saporta, with whom he collaborated on works in the field of botany. As a zoologist, his research included studies of segmented marine worms, free-living roundworms of the Mediterranean, nemerteans, rotifers, zoantharians, alcyonarians, parasites that affected crustaceans and investigations of the class Enteropneusta. As a result of his work in the fight against Phylloxera (an aphid-like pest), he was given awards by the French and foreign governments. He was a founder of the publication \\"Annales du Mus√©e d'histoire naturelle de Marseille\\". His painting The Village Church now belongs to the Fitzwilliam Museum.

It is characterised by the processes of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the development of the human body entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being. Fertilisation occurs when the sperm cell successfully enters and fuses with an egg cell (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences. Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus. Human embryology is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of gestation (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks. The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until implantation is completed in the uterus. The germinal stage takes around 10 days. During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called cleavage. A blastocyst is then formed and implanted in the uterus. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of gastrulation, when the three germ layers of the embryo form in a process called histogenesis, and the processes of neurulation and organogenesis follow. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and cellular differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among chordates.  Germinal stage  = Fertilization = Fertilization takes place when the spermatozoon has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the gametes fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single diploid cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the fallopian tubes. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the mitotic division which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells. Successful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of chemotaxis which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of acrosomal reaction takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an acrosome which contains digestive enzymes to break down the zona pellucida and allow its entry. The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the zona reaction. This sees the release of cortical granules that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing polyspermy. The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry. = Cleavage = 8-cell embryo, at 3 days The beginning of the cleavage process is marked when the zygote divides through mitosis into two cells. This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours. The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size. This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases. Initially the dividing cells, called blastomeres (blastos Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of glycoproteins (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum. When eight blastomeres have formed they begin to develop gap junctions, enabling them to develop in an integrated way and co- ordinate their response to physiological signals and environmental cues. When the cells number around sixteen the solid sphere of cells within the zona pellucida is referred to as a morula At this stage the cells start to bind firmly together in a process called compaction, and cleavage continues as cellular differentiation. = Blastulation = Blastocyst with an inner cell mass and trophoblast. Cleavage itself is the first stage in blastulation, the process of forming the blastocyst. Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the trophoblast) and an inner cell mass. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the zona pellucida. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become embryoblasts and polarise at one end. They close together and form gap junctions, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the blastocoel, creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the blastula.) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to hatch through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo The inner cell mass will give rise to the pre-embryo, the amnion, yolk sac and allantois, while the fetal part of the placenta will form from the outer trophoblast layer. The embryo plus its membranes is called the conceptus, and by this stage the conceptus has reached the uterus. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, and the now exposed cells of the trophoblast allow the blastocyst to attach itself to the endometrium, where it will implant. The formation of the hypoblast and epiblast, which are the two main layers of the bilaminar germ disc, occurs at the beginning of the second week. Either the embryoblast or the trophoblast will turn into two sub-layers. The inner cells will turn into the hypoblast layer, which will surround the other layer, called the epiblast, and these layers will form the embryonic disc that will develop into the embryo. The trophoblast will also develop two sub- layers: the cytotrophoblast, which is in front of the syncytiotrophoblast, which in turn lies within the endometrium. Next, another layer called the exocoelomic membrane or Heuser‚Äôs membrane will appear and surround the cytotrophoblast, as well as the primitive yolk sac. The syncytiotrophoblast will grow and will enter a phase called lacunar stage, in which some vacuoles will appear and be filled by blood in the following days. The development of the yolk sac starts with the hypoblastic flat cells that form the exocoelomic membrane, which will coat the inner part of the cytotrophoblast to form the primitive yolk sac. An erosion of the endothelial lining of the maternal capillaries by the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the sinusoids will form where the blood will begin to penetrate and flow through the trophoblast to give rise to the uteroplacental circulation. Subsequently new cells derived from yolk sac will be established between trophoblast and exocelomic membrane and will give rise to extra-embryonic mesoderm, which will form the chorionic cavity. At the end of the second week of development, some cells of the trophoblast penetrate and form rounded columns into the syncytiotrophoblast. These columns are known as primary villi. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac. = Implantation = Trophoblast differentiation After ovulation, the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its secretory glands becoming elongated, and is increasingly vascular. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the decidua, and it produces a great number of large decidual cells in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called the trophoblast.The trophoblast then differentiates into an inner layer, the cytotrophoblast, and an outer layer, the syncytiotrophoblast. The cytotrophoblast contains cuboidal epithelial cells and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a syncytial layer without cell boundaries. The syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual epithelium by projections of chorionic villi, forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the myometrium and forms the maternal part of the placenta. The implantation is assisted by hydrolytic enzymes that erode the epithelium. The syncytiotrophoblast also produces human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that stimulates the release of progesterone from the corpus luteum. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored glycogen from its cells to nourish the embryo. The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo. Arteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing gas exchange and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta. As the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs. =Embryonic disc= The embryoblast forms an embryonic disc, which is a bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the hypoblast (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity (extraembryonic coelom). Gastrulation Histogenesis of the three germ layers Artificially colored - gestational sac, yolk sac and embryo (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks) Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity The primitive streak, a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of gastrulation, which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes bilateral symmetry. A primitive node (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of neurulation. A primitive pit forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the notochord which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the neural plate which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called ingression, which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the amnion. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three germ layers of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the gastrula. The three germ layers are the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of somitogenesis, histogenesis and organogenesis.Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed. (2006). \\"Human Ontogeny: Gastrulation, Neurulation, and Somite Formation\\". Atlas of anatomy: general anatomy and musculoskeletal system. Thieme. .url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NK9TgTaGt6UC&pg;=PA6 The embryonic endoderm is formed by invagination of epiblastic cells that migrate to the hypoblast, while the mesoderm is formed by the cells that develop between the epiblast and endoderm. In general, all germ layers will derive from the epiblast. The upper layer of ectoderm will give rise to the outermost layer of skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, eyes, inner ear, and many connective tissues. The middle layer of mesoderm will give rise to the heart and the beginning of the circulatory system as well as the bones, muscles and kidneys. The inner layer of endoderm will serve as the starting point for the development of the lungs, intestine, thyroid, pancreas and bladder. Following ingression, a blastopore develops where the cells have ingressed, in one side of the embryo and it deepens to become the archenteron, the first formative stage of the gut. As in all deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of neurulation can begin. Neurulation Neural plate Neural tube development Following gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and neural tissue, and the gastrula is now referred to as the neurula. The neural plate that has formed as a thickened plate from the ectoderm, continues to broaden and its ends start to fold upwards as neural folds. Neurulation refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the neural tube, and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow neural groove which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the neural crest. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the paraxial mesoderm, which will give rise to the somitomeres that in the process of somitogenesis will differentiate into somites that will form the sclerotomes, the syndetomes, the myotomes and the dermatomes to form cartilage and bone, tendons, dermis (skin), and muscle. The intermediate mesoderm gives rise to the urogenital tract and consists of cells that migrate from the middle region of the primitive line. Other cells migrate through the caudal part of the primitive line and form the lateral mesoderm, and those cells migrating by the most caudal part contribute to the extraembryonic mesoderm. The embryonic disc begins flat and round, but eventually elongates to have a wider cephalic part and narrow-shaped caudal end. At the beginning, the primitive line extends in cephalic direction and 18 days after fertilization returns caudally until it disappears. In the cephalic portion, the germ layer shows specific differentiation at the beginning of the 4th week, while in the caudal portion it occurs at the end of the 4th week. Cranial and caudal neuropores become progressively smaller until they close completely (by day 26) forming the neural tube. Development of organs and organ systems Organogenesis is the development of the organs that begins during the third to eighth week, and continues until birth. Sometimes full development, as in the lungs, continues after birth. Different organs take part in the development of the many organ systems of the body. =Blood= Haematopoietic stem cells that give rise to all the blood cells develop from the mesoderm. The development of blood formation takes place in clusters of blood cells, known as blood islands, in the yolk sac. Blood islands develop outside the embryo, on the umbilical vesicle, allantois, connecting stalk, and chorion, from mesodermal hemangioblasts. In the centre of a blood island, hemangioblasts form the haematopoietic stem cells that are the precursor to all types of blood cell. In the periphery of a blood island the hemangioblasts differentiate into angioblasts the precursors to the blood vessels. =Heart and circulatory system= 450px The heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around 21 or 22 days. Cardiac myoblasts and blood islands in the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme on each side of the neural plate, give rise to the cardiogenic region.This is a horseshoe-shaped area near to the head of the embryo. By day 19, following cell signalling, two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them. These two endocardial tubes grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the thoracic cavity. Also at the same time that the endocardial tubes are forming, vasculogenesis (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into angioblasts that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of angiogenesis. Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of vascular remodelling takes place. The tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the infundibulum, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the truncus arteriosus. This will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus. Cardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of morphogenesis, and this completes by the end of the fourth week. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place. In the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the vitelline, the umbilical and the common cardinal veins. During the first two months of development, the interatrial septum begins to form. This septum divides the primitive atrium into a right and a left atrium. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the septum primum. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the ostium primum. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the ostium secundum) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood. A second septum (the septum secundum) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the foramen ovale which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the ventricles the septum inferius also forms which develops into the muscular interventricular septum. =Digestive system= The digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves. = Respiratory system = The respiratory system develops from the lung bud, which appears in the ventral wall of the foregut about four weeks into development. The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main bronchi. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes). Tertiary bronchi form from secondary bronchi. While the internal lining of the larynx originates from the lung bud, its cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches. = Urinary system =  Kidneys  Three different kidney systems form in the developing embryo: the pronephros, the mesonephros and the metanephros. Only the metanephros develops into the permanent kidney. All three are derived from the intermediate mesoderm. = Pronephros = The pronephros derives from the intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region. It is not functional and degenerates before the end of the fourth week. = Mesonephros = The mesonephros derives from intermediate mesoderm in the upper thoracic to upper lumbar segments. Excretory tubules are formed and enter the mesonephric duct, which ends in the cloaca. The mesonephric duct atrophies in females, but participate in development of the reproductive system in males. = Metanephros = The metanephros appears in the fifth week of development. An outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, the ureteric bud, penetrates metanephric tissue to form the primitive renal pelvis, renal calyces and renal pyramids. The ureter is also formed.  Bladder and urethra  Between the fourth and seventh weeks of development, the urorectal septum divides the cloaca into the urogenital sinus and the anal canal. The upper part of the urogenital sinus forms the bladder, while the lower part forms the urethra. = Reproductive system = = Integumentary system = The superficial layer of the skin, the epidermis, is derived from the ectoderm. The deeper layer, the dermis, is derived from mesenchyme. The formation of the epidermis begins in the second month of development and it acquires its definitive arrangement at the end of the fourth month. The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual layers of the epidermis. The mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources: * The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the lateral plate mesoderm * The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from paraxial mesoderm * The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from neural crest cells =Nervous system= Development of brain in 8 week old embryo Late in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube bends ventrally as the cephalic flexure at the level of the future midbrain‚Äîthe mesencephalon. Above the mesencephalon is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain). Cranial neural crest cells migrate to the pharyngeal arches as neural stem cells, where they develop in the process of neurogenesis into neurons. The optical vesicle (which eventually becomes the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon. The alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon. Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth. Development of physical features =Face and neck= From the third to the eighth week the face and neck develop. = Ears = The inner ear, middle ear and outer ear have distinct embryological origins.  Inner ear  At about 22 days into development, the ectoderm on each side of the rhombencephalon thickens to form otic placodes. These placodes invaginate to form otic pits, and then otic vesicles. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components. The ventral component forms the saccule and the cochlear duct. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding mesenchyme, travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow ductus reuniens. The dorsal component forms the utricle and semicircular canals.  Middle ear  The tympanic cavity and eustachian tube are derived from the first pharyngeal pouch (a cavity lined by endoderm). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube. The bones of the middle ear, the ossicles, derive from the cartilages of the pharyngeal arches. The malleus and incus derive from the cartilage of the first pharyngeal arch, whereas the stapes derives from the cartilage of the second pharyngeal arch.  Outer ear  The external auditory meatus develops from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. Six auricular hillocks, which are mesenchymal proliferations at the dorsal aspects of the first and second pharyngeal arches, form the auricle of the ear. =Eyes= The eyes begin to develop from the third week to the tenth week. Movements of embryo at 9 weeks gestational age. =Limbs= At the end of the fourth week limb development begins. Limb buds appear on the ventrolateral aspect of the body. They consist of an outer layer of ectoderm and an inner part consisting of mesenchyme which is derived from the parietal layer of lateral plate mesoderm. Ectodermal cells at the distal end of the buds form the apical ectodermal ridge, which creates an area of rapidly proliferating mesenchymal cells known as the progress zone. Cartilage (some of which ultimately becomes bone) and muscle develop from the mesenchyme. Clinical significance Toxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major congenital malformations, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing. Each cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the different cell types in the developing embryo. This cell potency means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by IVF, can be removed by biopsy and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's uterus. Sacrococcygeal teratomas, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear. First arch syndromes are congenital disorders of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch. Spina bifida a congenital disorder is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube. Vertically transmitted infections can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its development. Hypoxia a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a preterm or premature birth.

Tamil mythology means the stories and sacred narratives belonging to the Tamil people. This body of mythology is a mix of elements from the Tamil culture, Dravidian culture and Indus Valley cultures along with the Hindu religious aspects. Gods The Tamil literature in parallel with the Sanskrit literature formed a major source of information on Hindu culture. The ancient Tamil epics forms the source of various historical figures in Hindu scripture like Agastya, Iravan, Patanjali etc. Ancient Tamil literature is the source of Tamil deities like Murugan and Kortravai. Tholkappiyam mentions Seyon or \\"the red one \\"and kortravai as the goddess who was worshiped in the dry lands. Tamil literature forms the source of history of Nataraja, Meenakshi, Tirupati, Rameswaram. =Kartikeya= Kartikeya (, ), also known as Skanda, Kumara, Murugan and Subrahmanya, is the Hindu god of war. He is the son of Parvati and Shiva, brother of Ganesha, and a god whose life story has many versions in Hinduism. An important deity around South Asia since ancient times, Kartikeya is particularly popular and predominantly worshipped in South India, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia as Murugan. Kartikeya is an ancient god, traceable to the Vedic era. Archaeological evidence from 1st-century CE and earlier, where he is found with Hindu god Agni (fire), suggest that he was a significant deity in early Hinduism. He is found in many medieval temples all over India, such as at the Ellora Caves and Elephanta Caves. The iconography of Kartikeya varies significantly; he is typically represented as an ever- youthful man, riding or near a peacock, dressed with weapons sometimes near a rooster. Most icons show him with one head, but some show him with six heads reflecting the legend surrounding his birth. He grows up quickly into a philosopher-warrior, destroys evil in the form of demon Taraka, teaches the pursuit of ethical life and the theology of Shaiva Siddhanta. He has inspired many poet-saints, such as Arunagirinathar. =Ayyappan= (),() (also called Sastavu, or Sasta) is a Hindu deity worshiped in a number of shrines across India. Ayyappan is believed to be an incarnation of Dharma Sasta, who is the offspring of Shiva and Vishnu (as Mohini, is the only female avatar of the God Vishnu) and is generally depicted in a yogic posture, wearing a jewel around his neck, hence named Manikandan. Ayyappan may bear a historical relationship to the tutelary deity Aiyanar in Tamil Nadu.\\"Ayyappan.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 23 Dec. 2011. The asura princess Mahishi was burning up with anger at the trick the gods had pulled on her brother, the asura king Mahishasura. As Mahishasura was blessed with invulnerability to all men, the gods had sent goddess Durga, to fight and kill him. Thus, Mahishi began performing a fearsome set of austerities, and pleased the creator god Brahma. She asked for the boon of invulnerability, but Brahma said it was not possible so Mahishi planned and asked invulnerability to all men except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu (Both are male & no possibility to give birth to any one). He granted her the boon of ruling the universe and being invulnerable except by the son of Shiva and Vishnu. Since such a person did not exist, she thought she was safe and began conquering and plundering the world. The gods implored Shiva and Vishnu to save them from this catastrophe. Vishnu found a possible solution to the problem. When Vishnu had taken on the Kurma Avatar, he also had to manifest himself as Mohini, the enchantress, to save the nectar of immortality (ambrosia or amrit) from the demons who were not willing to share it with the gods. If he became Mohini again, then the female Mohini and the male Shiva could have the divine child who would combine their powers and beat Mahishi. Some versions give a slightly more detailed version of the union of Shiva with Vishnu. One version tells that the asura Bhasmasura had so pleased Lord Shiva with his austerities that Shiva gave him a boon of anything he wished. So Bhasmasura asked for the ability to burn to ashes anything which he placed his hand over. No sooner had Shiva granted this, than Bhasmasura ran after the god, threatening to turn him to ashes. Shiva called to Lord Vishnu for help. He hide himself in a peepal tree as Bhasmasura ran here and there searching for the god. Vishnu became aware of the events, and decided that he would take the female form Mohini, \\"the Enchanting\\", and try to trump the asura's powers. When Bhasmasura saw Vishnu in this form, he was bewitched by her beauty. He earnestly tried to court her. So Vishnu instructed Bhasmasura to hold his hand over his head, and vow fidelity. With this act, Bhasmasura was reduced to ashes. Vishnu found Shiva and explained the whole affair to him. Shiva asked if he too could see Vishnu in this female form. When Vishnu appeared thus, Shiva was overcome with passion, and united with her. The two gods thus became \\"Harihara Murthi\\", that is a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu as one god. From this union, Lord Sree Dharma Sastha was born. He combined in himself the powers of Vishnu and Shiva. Lord Ayyappan is an incarnation of Lord Sree Dharma Sastha and Lord Ayyappan is a visible embodiment of their essential identity. Sri Ayyappa belongs to Pandya Royal Community. He was the head of a clan. It is believed Sri Ayyappa merged to sri dharma sastha. Lord Vishnu gifted the new-born deity with a little bejeweled bell necklace, so this god is called Manikandan. He is also Known as Dharma Shasthavu, Kerala Puthran. =Thirumal= Perumal () also Thirumal () is the Hindu deity most popular amongst Tamils of Tamil Nadu state in India and in the Tamil diaspora. Perumal is another name of Vishnu. Mentions in sangam literature  Tamil Sangam literature (200BCE to 500CE) mentions MƒÅyon or the \\"dark one,\\"as the supreme deity who creates, sustains and destroys the universe and was worshiped in the mountains of Tamilagam .Paripadal-3 describes the glory of Thirumal in the most superlative terms. Paripadal(3)by kaduvan iLaveyinanAr: \\"thIyinuL theRal nI poovinuL naaRRa nI kallinuL maNiyu nI sollinuL vaaymai aRaththinuL anbu nI maRaththinuL mainthu nI vEthaththu maRai nI boothaththu madhalu nI vencudar oLiyu nI thingaLuL aLiyu nI anaiththu nI anaiththinut poruLu nI\\" The last line states that Thirumal is the supreme deity who is the inner controller (Antaryamin) of the entire universe. This is one of the Lord's glories, which is first mentioned in Vedas and later propounded by Alwars in Prabhandams and Sri Vaishnavaite Acharyas in various commentaries.  Popularity in Tamil Nadu  Thirumal (Vishnu) is the only deity who has enjoyed the status of Paramporul during the Sangam age. The reference to \\"Mukkol Bhagavars\\" in Sangam literature clearly indicates that only Vaishnavaite saints holding Tridanda existed during the sangam age and Thirumal was glorified as the supreme deity whose divine lotus feet can burn all our evils and grant Moksha (Maru Piraparukkum Maasil Sevadi). During the post-Sangam period, his worship was further glorified by the alwars and great Vaishnavite acharyas. = Natraja of Chidambaram = The story of Chidambaram begins with Lord Shiva strolling into the Thillai Vanam (vanam meaning forest and thillai trees - botanical name Exocoeria agallocha, a species of mangrove trees - which currently grows in the Pichavaram wetlands near Chidambaram). In the Thillai forests resided a group of sages or 'rishis' who believed in the supremacy of magic and that God can be controlled by rituals and mantras or magical words.Anand 2004, p. 149 Lord Shiva strolled in the forest with resplendent beauty and brilliance, assuming the form of Bhikshatana, a simple mendicant seeking alms. He was followed by His consort, Vishnu as Mohini. The sages and their wives were enchanted by the brilliance and the beauty of The handsome mendicant and His consort. On seeing their womenfolk enchanted, the rishis got enraged and invoked scores of serpents (nƒÅgas) by performing magical rituals. Lord Shiva lifted the serpents and donned them as ornaments on His matted locks, neck and waist. Further enraged, the sages invoked a fierce tiger, whose skins and dons were used by Lord Shiva as a shawl around His waist and then followed by a fierce elephant, which was devoured and ripped to death by Lord Shiva (Gajasamharamurthy). The rishis gathered all their spiritual strength and invoked a powerful demon Muyalakan - a symbol of complete arrogance and ignorance. Lord Shiva wore a gentle smile, stepped on the demon's back, immobilized him and performed the √Ånanda Tandava (the dance of eternal bliss) and disclosed his true form. The sages surrender, realizing that Lord Shiva is the truth and He is beyond magic and rituals. =Meenakshi= One of the Gopuram of Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai Once Indra killed a demon, even though the demon did not harm anyone. This act brought a curse upon Indra that forced him to continue wandering until he was walking around looking for a way where no one would tell him which way to go will redeem him from his sin. After much wandering, Indra was freed from his suffering through the power of a Shivalingam in a forest, and so he built a small temple at that site. It so happened that at that time in South India there was a Pandyan king called Malayadhwaja PandiyanPandya Kingdom#Pandyas in Kurukshetra War ruling a small city by the name Manavur, which was quite near to this Shivalinga. He was the son of Kulashekara Pandyan. He came to know about the Shivalinga and decided to build a huge temple for Shiva in the forest Kadambavanam (vanam means forest). He also developed the region into a fine princely state called Madurai. The king was childless and sought an heir for the kingdom. Shiva granted him his prayers through an Ayonija child (one born not from the womb). This child was three years old and actually the incarnation of goddess Parvati the consort of Shiva. She was born with fish- shaped eyes. It was said that the extra breast would disappear when she met her future husband. She was named Mƒ´nachchi, (meaning fish eyed) from the words mƒ´na (meaning fish) and ak·π£i (meaning eyes). Mƒ´nakshi also means \\"the one who has eyes like that of a fish\\". Fishes are said to feed their younger ones with their eyes, similarly goddess looks after her devotees. Just by her sight our miseries disappear. Shiva the Nataraja performing the Universal dance She grew up to be a Shiva-Shakti personification. After the death of the king, she ruled the kingdom with skillful administration. In one of her expeditions she went to the Himalayas and there, on seeing Shiva, her extra breast disappeared. Many of the gods and goddesses came to witness their marriage. At the wedding celebrations the gods refused to have the served food unless Shiva performed a majestic dance for everybody gathered at the place. At this there was the dance of Chidambaram, the cosmic dance in front of his wife Minakshi. It epitomised and merged all life force and beauty into one whole. In the end Minakshi was merged with the shivalingam and became the representation of life and beauty. There is another legend that talks about why the North Tower (called as \\"Mottai Gopuram\\") does not have that many sculptures. Bhootaganas were supposed to finish the construction of the temple towers during the night. Legend says that bhootaganas completed all three towers but while in the middle of building the north tower sunrise happened halting the completion of the north tower. A Tamil poem shows the goddess Meenakshi as a girl washing crockery and pots (which consist of all the worlds). This is a daily task, because her husband Shiva repeatedly messes up the universe, which Minakshi must once more sort out and clean. :Shiva wanders through the courtyard of space :destroying your work again and again, :and then comes before you dancing. :You never get angry. :Every day, you just pick up the vessels. In thirty words, Minakshi becomes a global icon for all who deal with 'impossible' children (or husbands). Themes and activities of early childhood run through the poems. God in the little child is worshipped and protected amidst the toys in the kitchen and back yard =Kannagi= Kannagi or (Kannaki), a legendary Tamil woman, is the central character of the South Indian epic Silapathikaram (100-300 CE). The story relates how Kannagi took revenge on the early Pandyan King of Madurai, for a mistaken death penalty imposed on her husband Kovalan, by cursing the city with disaster. Kannagi Statue in Marina Beach, Chennai Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple was built to commemorate the martyrdom of Kannagi. It is said that sixth avatar of Vishnu, Sage Parasurama built this temple for the prosperity of the people. According to the old chronicles, this Bhagavathi temple was created in the heart of the town many centuries ago to serve a special purpose. Deity of Kodungallur Bhagavathy in the temple Legend says that, after the creation of Kerala by Parasurama, he was harassed by a demon called Daruka. To kill this evil demon, Parasurama prayed to Lord Shiva for help. As advised by Shiva, Parasurama constructed the shrine and installed the Shakti Devi as Bhagavathi. The deity in the temple, it is believed, is Parashakthi herself. According to legends, it was Bhadrakali who killed the evil demon Daruka. She is worshiped as goddess Pattini in Sri Lanka by the Sinhalese Buddhists, Kannaki Amman by the Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus' (See Hinduism in Sri Lanka) and as Kodungallur Bhagavathy and Attukal Bhagavathy in the South Indian state of Kerala.Shankar Radhakrishnan HAI Bubbling over with devotion The Hindu news. Kannagi is also viewed as a brave woman who could demand justice directly from the King and even dared to call him \\"unenlightened king\\" (\\"Thera Manna\\", Vazhakkurai Kathai, Silappathikaram). The Powerful Tamil Saints :The Siddhars Siddhars (Tamil: ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øç) are saints in India, mostly of the Saivaite denomination in Tamil Nadu, who professed and practised an unorthodox type of Sadhana, or spiritual practice, to attain liberation. Yogic powers called Siddhis are acquired by constant practice of certain yogic disciplines. Those who acquire these Siddhis are called Siddhas. These sidhars can be compared to Mystics of the western civilization. Siddhars are people who are believed to control and transcend the barriers of time and space by meditation (Yoga), after the use of substances called Rasayanas that transform the body to make it potentially deathless, and a particular breathing-practice, a type of Pranayama. Through their practices they are believed to have reached stages of insight which enabled them to tune into the powers hidden in various material substances and practices, useful for suffering and ignorant mankind. Typically Siddhars were saints, doctors, alchemists and mysticists all at once. They wrote their findings, in the form of poems in Tamil language, on palm leaves which are collected and stored in what are known today as Palm leaf manuscript, today still owned by private families in Tamil Nadu and handed down through the generations, as well as public institutions such as Universities all over the world (India, Germany, Great Britain, U.S.). In this way Siddhars developed, among other branches of a vast knowledge-system, what is now known as Siddha medicine, practised mainly in Tamil Nadu as Traditional native medicine. A rustic form of healing that is similar to Siddha medicine has since been practised by experienced elderly in the villages of Tamil Nadu. (This has been misunderstood as Paatti Vaitthiyam, Naattu marunthu and Mooligai marutthuvam. While paati vaitthiyam or naatu marunthu is traditional Tamil medicine and mooligai marutthuvam is ayurvedic medicine.) They are also founders of Varmam - a martial art for self-defence and medical treatment at the same time. Varmam are specific points located in the human body which when pressed in different ways can give various results, such as disabling an attacker in self-defence, or balancing a physical condition as an easy first-aid medical treatment. Tamil Siddhars were the first to develop pulse-reading (\\"naadi paarththal\\" in Tamil) to identify the origin of diseases. This method was later copied and used in ayurvedha.Dr.J. Raamachandran, Herbs of Siddha Medicines Herbs of Siddha Medicine/The First 3D book on Herbs, pp.iii Siddhars have also written many religious poems. It is believed that most of them have lived for ages, in a mystic mountain called Sathuragiri, near Thanipparai village in Tamil Nadu. One of the best-known Siddhars was Agasthyar or Agasthya, who is believed to be the founding father of Siddha culture. Abithana Chintamani states Siddhars are either of the 9 or 18 persons enlisted, but sage Agastyar states that there are many who precede these and follow 9 or 18 persons. Many of the great Siddhars are regarded to have powers magical and spiritual. = Some Siddhars = The 9 siddhars The 9 listed as Abithana Chintamani states is as follows: #Sathyanathar # #Aadhinathar #Bogar #Vegulinathar #Madhanganathar #Machaendranathar #Gadaendranathar or Gajendranathar #Korakkanathar There are totally 18 siddhars in the Tamil siddha tradition.see Siddhar = Powers of siddhars = The siddhars are believed to have had powers both major and other ‚Äòminor‚Äô powers. They are explained in detail in various yogic as well as religious texts.Thirumandiram 668 They also have the power converting their mass to energy and thereby travel in space in light speed to different universe. # Anima (shrinking)  Power of becoming the size of an atom and entering the smallest beings # Mahima (illimitability)  Power of becoming mighty and co- extensive with the universe. The power of increasing one's size without limit # Lagima (lightness)  Capacity to be quite light though big in size # Garima (weight)  Capacity to weigh heavy, though seemingly small size # Prapthi (fulfillment of desires)  Capacity to enter all the worlds from Brahma Loga to the nether world. It is the power of attaining everything desired # Prakasysm (irresistible will)  Power of disembodying and entering into other bodies (metempsychosis) and going to heaven and enjoying what everyone aspires for, simply from where he stays # Isithavam (supremacy)  Have the creative power of god and control over the sun, the moon and the elements # Vasithavam (dominion over the elements)  Power of control over kings and gods. The power of changing the course of nature and assuming any form These eight are the Great Siddhis (Ashtama siddhis), or Great Perfections. The Great Ancient Tamil Continent Kumari Kandam Tamil:‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç, Kumarikka·πá·π≠am) is the name of a supposed sunken landmass referred to in existing ancient Tamil literature. It is said to have been located in the Indian Ocean, to the south of present-day Kanyakumari district at the southern tip of India. =References in Tamil literature= There are scattered references in Sangam literature, such as Kalittokai 104, to how the sea took the land of the Pandiyan kings, upon which they conquered new lands to replace those they had lost. There are also references to the rivers Pahruli and Kumari, that are said to have flowed in a now-submerged land. The Silappadhikaram, one of the Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature written in first few centuries CE, states that the \\"cruel sea\\" took the Pandiyan land that lay between the rivers Pahruli and the mountainous banks of the Kumari, to replace which the Pandiyan king conquered lands belonging to the Chola and Chera kings (Maturaikkandam, verses 17-22). Adiyarkkunallar, a 12th-century commentator on the epic, explains this reference by saying that there was once a land to the south of the present-day Kanyakumari, which stretched for 700 kavatam from the Pahruli river in the north to the Kumari river in the south. As the modern equivalent of a kavatam is unknown, estimates of the size of the lost land vary from to in length, to others suggesting a total area of 6‚Äì7,000 square miles, or smaller still an area of just a few villages. This land was divided into 49 nadu, or territories, which he names as seven coconut territories (elutenga natu), seven Madurai territories (elumaturai natu), seven old sandy territories (elumunpalai natu), seven new sandy territories (elupinpalai natu), seven mountain territories (elukunra natu), seven eastern coastal territories (elukunakarai natu) and seven dwarf-palm territories (elukurumpanai natu). All these lands, he says, together with the many- mountained land that began with KumariKollam, with forests and habitations, were submerged by the sea. Two of these Nadus or territories were supposedly parts of present-day Kollam and Kanyakumari districts. None of these texts name the land \\"Kumari Kandam\\" or \\"Kumarinadu\\", as is common today. The only similar pre-modern reference is to a \\"Kumari Kandam\\" (written ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç, rather than ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç as the land is called in modern Tamil), which is named in the medieval Tamil text Kantapuranam either as being one of the nine continents,Madras Tamil lexicon, ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç or one of the nine divisions of India and the only region not to be inhabited by barbarians. 19th and 20th century Tamil revivalist movements, however, came to apply the name to the territories described in Adiyarkkunallar's commentary to the Silappadhikaram. They also associated this territory with the references in the Tamil Sangams, and said that the fabled cities of southern Madurai (Ten Madurai) and Kapatapuram where the first two Sangams were said to be held were located on Kumari Kandam. These sangams may have overlapped in parallel to the third historic sangam; the second century BCE Tissamaharama Tamil Brahmi inscription detailing the thiraLi muRi (written agreement of the assembly) was excavated a few miles from the coast of the historic Tenavaram temple, Matara, Sri Lanka. =Modern revival= Kumari Kandam, as identified with Lemuria In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Tamil nationalists came to identify Kumari Kandam with Lemuria, a \\"lost continent\\" posited in the 19th century to account for discontinuities in biogeography. In these accounts, Kumari Kandam became the \\"cradle of civilization\\", the origin of human languages in general and the Tamil language in particular. These ideas gained notability in Tamil academic literature over the first decades of the 20th century, and were popularized by the Tanittamil Iyakkam, notably by self-taught Dravidologist Devaneya Pavanar, who held that all languages on earth were merely corrupted Tamil dialects. R. Mathivanan, then Chief Editor of the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project of the Government of Tamil Nadu, in 1991 claimed to have deciphered the still undeciphered Indus script as Tamil, following the methodology recommended by his teacher Devaneya Pavanar, presenting the following timeline (cited after Mahadevan 2002): :ca. 200,000 to 50,000 BC: evolution of \\"the Tamilian or Homo Dravida\\", :ca. 200,000 to 100,000 BC: beginnings of the Tamil language :50,000 BC: Kumari Kandam civilisation :20,000 BC: A lost Tamil culture of the Easter Island which had an advanced civilisation :16,000 BC: Lemuria submerged :6087 BC: Second Tamil Sangam established by a Pandya king :3031 BC: A Chera prince in his wanderings in the Solomon Islands saw wild sugarcane and started cultivation in Present Tamil nadu. :1780 BC: The Third Tamil Sangam established by a Pandya king :7th century BC: Tolkappiyam (the earliest known extant Tamil grammar) =Popular culture= * Kumari Kandam appeared in the episodes \\"The King of Kumari Kandam\\" and \\"The Atlas Pin\\" of The Secret Saturdays. This version is a city on the back of a giant sea serpent with its inhabitants all fish people. =Loss and imagination= Sumathi Ramaswamy's book, The Lost Land of Lemuria: Fabulous Geographies, Catastrophic Histories (2004) is a theoretically sophisticated study of the Lemuria legends that widens the discussion beyond previous treatments, looking at Lemuria narratives from nineteenth-century Victorian-era science to Euro-American occultism, colonial, and post colonial India. Ramaswamy discusses particularly how cultures process the experience of loss.

The overture was selected for performance at the 1926 International Society for Contemporary Music festival, and received its first performance in Z√ºrich on 22 June 1926, conducted by Volkmar Andreae. The first London performance was on 28 June 1926, with Eugene Goossens conducting the overture as an interval work in the midst of a Diaghilev ballet performance. Walton himself conducted the overture at The Proms in 1927. Constant Lambert later prepared a version of the overture, with a reduced orchestration, from Walton's original, and also with simplified time signatures. Lambert first conducted this version in 1932. Portsmouth Point depicts in musical form the rumbustious life of British 18th century sailors. Commentators have noted the influence of Igor Stravinsky's music and of jazz in the rhythms of the score, as well as the rhythm of the Catalan sardana dance. In 1953, Walton briefly quoted this work in his contribution to the collaborative work Variations on an Elizabethan Theme.

Description Sexual dimorphism is similar to that of the Rineloricaria group, including hypertrophied odontodes forming brushes on the lateral surfaces of the head in mature males and papillose lips. However, it is also morphologically similar to members of the Loricariichthys group. It shares deep postorbital notches, an abdominal cover strongly structured, and a similar mouth shape; hypertrophied development of the lower lip has also been reported, a characteristic of representatives of the Loricariichthys group, suggesting that Dasyloricaria is also a lip brooder. Finally, with some representatives of the Loricaria group, it shares a triangular head, strong predorsal keels, and the upper caudal fin ray produced into a long whip. Dasyloricaria could represent a link between all other morphological groups.

He played as a defender. Playing career After spells as an amateur with Colwyn Bay, Skelmersdale United and Wycombe Wanderers, Suddaby began his professional career with Blackpool in 1970, and went on to make over 300 league appearances in a decade at the club. He made his debut for Blackpool on 23 January 1971, in a defeat at West Ham United in the fourth round of the FA Cup. He made a twelve League appearances in the 1970‚Äì71 season, at the conclusion of which Blackpool were relegated to Division Two after one season in the top flight. In 1971‚Äì72, Suddaby appeared in all but the final league game of the season. He scored two goals ‚Äì against Leyton Orient in a 4‚Äì1 victory at Bloomfield Road on 9 October 1971, and in a 5‚Äì0 whitewash of Watford, also at home, on New Year's Day. During a single-goal defeat by Fulham on 30 November 1974, Suddaby damaged his back and had to have a disc removed to alleviate the problem. As a consequence, he missed almost the rest of the 1974‚Äì75 campaign. Over the next three seasons, Suddaby made 102 league appearances. In 1975‚Äì76, he made 38 league appearances and scored four goals ‚Äì two of which came in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Luton Town at Bloomfield Road on 4 October 1975. In 1976‚Äì77, Suddaby was an ever-present in new manager Allan Brown's teams, helping the club to a fifth-placed Division Two finish. The following season, 1977‚Äì78, Suddaby scored Blackpool's goal in the opening league game of the season, at home to Oldham Athletic. He went on to make 39 more appearances in the league campaign, at the end of which Blackpool were relegated to Division Three for the first time. In 1978‚Äì79, under new manager Bob Stokoe, Suddaby appeared in 42 of Blackpool's 46 league games, scoring twice. Suddaby's final season at Blackpool, 1979‚Äì80, saw him start in fifteen of the first sixteen league games, before he was sold to Brighton & Hove Albion in November 1980. His final game for Blackpool was in a single-goal home defeat to Swindon Town on 27 October 1979. After 23 league games for Brighton, Suddaby had a short stint at Wimbledon, before returning to Wycombe Wanderers in 1982 for his final spell as a player. Managerial career Suddaby was appointed manager of his final club, Wycombe Wanderers, in 1987, nearly five years after hanging up his boots. His managerial career was unsuccessful, however, and he left the club in January 1988 after only five league wins from 25 matches.

Early life and career  √û√≥rarinn was born in 1867, the 13th of 14 children of a clergyman father, who died when √û√≥rarinn was just five years old. Originally trained and working as a bookbinder, √û√≥rarinn studied painting under a Copenhagen-trained Icelandic woman, Th√≥ra Thoroddsen. In 1900 he was awarded a grant by the Icelandic Parliament to study art in Denmark, and he trained there from 1895 to 1899. Returning to Iceland, he held an exhibition of his works at a place perplexingly called Glasgow, in Reykjav√≠k, in the summer of 1900‚Äîthe first exhibition of Icelandic painting in Iceland. √û√≥rarinn's principal interest was landscape painting, and perhaps fittingly a dominant subject in this first exhibition of works was √ûingvellir, a site of enormous historical significance to Icelanders as the site of their parliaments (which dated back to 930 AD).  Later career  √û√≥rarinn √ûorl√°ksson (left) with other members of the Icelandic Flag Committee, 1913 √û√≥rarinn continued to paint, holding regular exhibitions until 1911. However, he required a regular income that could not be derived solely from his art. On December 30, 1913, he was appointed by Prime Minister Hannes Hafstein as one of the five people on the committee that designed the Flag of Iceland.Thorlacius, Birgir: A brief history of the Icelandic flag, F√°ni √çslands, skjaldarmerki, √æj√≥√∞s√∂ngur, hei√∞ursmerki (\\"The Flag, Coat of Arms, National Anthem and Official Honours of Iceland\\"), Office of the Prime Minister of Iceland, 1991.

He also ran a shop selling art materials, journals and books until his death. Throughout his life he continued to paint, particularly in the countryside during the summers, and it was at his own summerhouse, Birkihl√≠√∞, that he died on July 10, 1924. √û√≥rarinn, together with a small number of other artists including his contemporary √Åsgr√≠mur J√≥nsson, confronted and portrayed the landscape of their country on its terms and through Icelandic eyes, rather than through the conventions‚Äîand the light‚Äîof Western European artistic tradition. In this respect the work of √û√≥rarinn and √Åsgr√≠mur played a role similar to that of the Heidelberg School in Australia (slightly earlier) and the Group of Seven, Emily Carr and Tom Thomson in Canada (a little later).

This proposal is to replace all United States taxes with a single tax (using a low rate) on every transaction in the economy. The APT approach would extend the tax base from income, consumption and wealth to all transactions. Proponents regard it as a revenue neutral transactions tax, whose tax base is primarily made up of financial transactions. It is based on the fundamental view of taxation as a \\"public brokerage fee accessed by the government to pay for the provision of the monetary, legal and political institutions that protect private property rights and facilitate market trade and commerce.\\" The APT tax extends the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes,Keynes, J.M. (1936). The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace, New York, NY. James Tobin and Lawrence Summers, to their logical conclusion, namely to tax the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate. The goal is to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection, and compliance costs). History The system was developed by University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Professor of Economics Dr. Edgar L. Feige, a student of Milton Friedman who earned his PhD in Economics at the University of Chicago. ‚Äú https://www.gailfosler.com/edgar-l-feige‚Äù Feige first presented the idea of taxing all transactions at the International Institute of Public Finance meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1989. Brazil took Feige's advise and adopted a plan similar to the APT Tax. However, Brazil added it on top of its existing taxes. Despite this, the tax has been relatively successful according to a 2009 report. It was first put in the US national spotlight in February 2003 when it was covered by The New York Times. The Times endorsed the plan as \\"fair, simple, and efficient.\\" On April 28, 2005, the APT proposal was presented to the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform in Washington, DC. Overview The APT Tax would replace the entire federal and state tax system - including income, corporate profits, excise and estate taxes - in favor of a tiny tax on all transactions. The tax would be automatically deducted from special taxpayer accounts, linked by software to all accounts at financial institutions capable of making final payments to the government seamlessly in real-time. The APT Tax non-profit organization advocated for an Automated Payment Transaction Tax writes that under the plan, \\"every bank, brokerage, or other financial account established by a person, corporation or other taxable organization will pay 0.35% on all funds moving in or out of that account. The tax would be automatically transferred to a federal government tax collection account in the same institution. This will be true for stock, bond, options, and futures traders and investors; foreign citizens, companies and governments exchanging their currency for US dollars; a couple buying a new car; and, a teenager buying movie tickets with a credit card. The movement of funds is taxed and collected immediately without recording who or what was the source of funds or the recipient. This automated system would totally eliminate the need for filing tax returns and information returns, freeing individuals and businesses of enormous costs of tax compliance and greatly reducing the government's costs of collection and enforcement.\\" The rate of the tax is measured as the Electronic Single Side Rate (ESSR). The ESSR is the tax rate charged to each individual. If the ESSR were 1%, then both parties to a transaction would pay the 1% tax. If a person were transferring money from one account to another, each account would pay a rate of 1%. For this transaction, the government would receive a combined rate of 2%. Dr. Feige writes that the tax could be as low as 0.3% to remain revenue neutral using data from 2005. Instead of acquiring taxes solely based on income (whether corporate or individual), the APT Tax would broaden the tax base to include Stocks, Bonds, and Options Transfers, Money Saving Transactions, Goods and Services, and Foreign Exchange related transactions.https://i1.wp.com/bigbatusa.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/12/APT-TAX.jpg?w=500 The ultimate goal is for the APT Tax to fund not only the Federal Government, but also \\"all state budgets (allowing the elimination of state income, sales, and excise taxes) as well as the public school portion of the local property tax.\\" Dr. Feige claims that the APT tax would be very simply, efficient, and hard to evade. He writes, \\"Since every transaction must be settled by some means of final payment, taxes are routinely assessed and collected at source through the electronic technology of the automated banking/payment clearing system at the moment that economic exchange is evidenced by final payment. This automatic collection feature eliminates the need for individuals and firms to file tax and information returns. Real time tax collection at source of payment applies to all types of transactions, thereby reducing administration and compliance costs as well as opportunities for tax evasion.\\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0b8/da0932b3d92f38d5bdd15c9a2934a5aee0ba.pdf The cash loophole is closed as well. Since cash goes through an average of 2.5 transactions between leaving a bank or other tax collecting entity, before it returns, a tax of 2.5 times the electronic single side rate would be charged on withdrawal and deposit. With the proposed rate of 0.3%, there would be a tax of $0.75 per $100 cash entering or leaving what Dr. Feige calls a \\"taxing institution/account\\". =Progressive Debate= There is disagreement over whether the tax is progressive, with the debate primarily centered on whether the volume of taxed transactions rise disproportionately with a person's income and net worth. Simulations of the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances demonstrate that high income and wealthy individuals undertake a disproportionate volume of transactions since they own a disproportionate share of financial assets that have relatively high turnover rates. However, since the APT tax has not yet been adopted, some argue that one can not predict whether the tax will be progressive or not. Proposed Implementation Because the APT Tax would radically affect taxation and the US economy, Dr. Feige recommends a 3 phase implementation. All rates listed below are based on Dr. Feige's 2005 report. *Phase I: All Federal income, estate, and excise taxes are removed over a period of a few years with adjustments in the money supply to avoid excessive inflationary pressures. (0.15% ESSR) *Phase II: Social security payroll taxes would be rolled into the APT rate. (0.24% ESSR) *Phase III: A mechanism could be established, probably requiring a Constitutional amendment, where an entity controlled by Congress, would collect additional taxes under the APT system to fund all state budgets allowing the elimination of state income, sales, and excise taxes as well as the public school portion of the local property tax.

Tectonic summary Sidewalk of Higashi-honcho, Kashiwazaki The landslide of ≈åmigawa Station (July 2007) This magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred approximately off the west coast of Honsh≈´, Japan, in a zone of compressional deformation that is associated with the boundary between the Amur Plate and the Okhotsk Plate. At this latitude, the Okhotsk Plate is converging to the west-northwest towards the Amur Plate with a velocity of about 9 mm/yr and a maximum convergence rate of 24 mm/yr. The Amur and Okhotsk plates are themselves relatively small plates that lie between the Eurasian Plate and the Pacific Plate. The Pacific Plate converges west-northwest towards the Eurasia Plate at over 90 mm/yr. Most of the relative motion between the Pacific and Eurasia plates is accommodated approximately to the east-southeast of the epicenter of the earthquake, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Okhotsk Plate. This shallow crustal earthquake was followed 13 hours later by a deep focus magnitude 6.8 quake roughly to the west, below the Sea of Japan. The two earthquakes were generated by different mechanisms. The first earthquake was caused by deformation within the crust of the Okhotsk Plate and the second quake was likely caused by faulting resulting from internal deformation of the subducted Pacific Plate. Given their different mechanisms and physical separation of at least 10 rupture lengths, the second earthquake is not considered an aftershock of the first. Shallow earthquakes cause more damage than intermediate- and deep-focus ones since the energy generated by the shallow events is released closer to the surface and therefore produces stronger shaking than is produced by quakes that are deeper within the Earth. The peak ground acceleration generated was 993 gal (1.01 g). Two days after the initial earthquake, an aftershock, registering 4 shindo, occurred in Izumozaki, Niigata.

Early life Bour Kry was born in Battambang and was ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1963. His early years in the monkhood were devoted to the study of the Pali Canon. In the following years, he was given the spiritual post of Secretary of the Mekon and appointed to the head of a monastery on the Thai-Cambodian border. Exile in France The rise to power of the Khmer Rouge in 1975 began a grim and violent period for the country, and the existence of the Cambodian Sangha was put in critical danger. Bour Kry managed to flee, arriving in France in 1976. In 1977, he founded the Association Bouddhique Khmer (Khmer Buddhist Association) with a small group of expatriate monks and laypersons. The growth of this religious community in the following years led to the establishment of Vatt Kh√©mararam at Cr√©teil, a suburb of Paris, in 1980. Bour Kry's continued support for the Southeast Asian refugee community saw the foundation of Secours Bouddhique International (International Buddhist Assistance), a humanitarian organization independent of the monastery, in 1982. Royal nominations Prince Norodom Sihanouk appointed Bour Kry to the rank of Spiritual Eminence () in 1987. Following the signing of the Paris Agreement in 1991, King Norodom Sihanouk further appointed Bour Kry to the head of the Cambodian Buddhist Dhammayuttika order with the title of Supreme Patriarch (). Social and religious activities Bour Kry in a funerary procession of the late Norodom Sihanouk After 1991 Bour Kry returned regularly to Cambodia to assist in the reconstruction and redevelopment of Buddhist schools and monasteries. The number of Dhammayuttika monasteries has since grown to over 150. The Preah Sihanouk Dhammadhiraj Buddhist Institute was founded in 1995 with the goal of education and professional training for Cambodia's poorest youth, the revitalization of Buddhist teachings, and the introduction of Cambodian youth to Khmer culture and traditions. Bour Kry has been involved in addressing the spread of AIDS, participating in international discussions on the topic and encouraging the role of the monastery in disseminating health information. He has also been active in spreading information concerning drug and cigarette dependence in Cambodia.

He played as a goalkeeper. Taylor began his professional career with Blackpool in 1963 after joining from local club Blackpool Rangers. Due to the form of Tony Waiters, Taylor didn't make his league debut for Blackpool until 29 January 1966, keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage. Another goalless draw followed, this time against Tottenham at Bloomfield Road, before Waiters returned to the fold for the remainder of the 1966‚Äì67 season. The following season, 1967‚Äì68, Taylor made only two early- one late-season league appearances in Waiters' absence. When Waiters left to become a coach at Liverpool in April 1967, thus missing Blackpool's final six games of the season, manager Stan Mortensen favoured another goalkeeper ‚Äì Kevin Thomas ‚Äì for five of the games. Thomas also started the first the games of the 1967‚Äì68 league season, before Taylor finally made the number-one jersey his own, appearing between the sticks for Blackpool's remaining 39 league games. In 1968‚Äì69, Taylor made 38 league appearances. He missed four games in late March and early April, at which point Thomas deputised, but he regained his place for the run-in. Under new manager Les Shannon, Taylor made only three league appearances during Blackpool's successful 1969‚Äì70 campaign, in which they gained promotion to Division One as runners-up behind Huddersfield Town. He was loaned out to Oldham Athletic during the season. In his final season at Blackpool, 1970‚Äì71, Taylor's appearances were again limited: just nine in the league. His final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 17 April 1971, in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. He was loaned out to Stockport County during the season.

Widener was ranked #29 on the American Heritage list of the forty richest Americans in history, with a net worth at death of $23 billion to $25 billion (in 1998 dollars). Early life The son of a Philadelphia butcher, Widener was born on November 13, 1834, to Johannes Widener and Sarah Fulmer. He was named after Peter Arrell Browne (1782-1860), a noted lawyer in 19th-century Philadelphia. Career During the Civil War, Widener won a contract to supply mutton to all Union Army troops within 10 miles of Philadelphia. The city was a major transportation hub for troop deployment, and the location of many of the largest Union military hospitals. Widener invested his $50,000 profit in horse-drawn city streetcar lines. He grew to prominence in Philadelphia politics, and had become the City Treasurer by 1871. In 1883, he was a founding partner in the Philadelphia Traction Company, which electrified the city's trolley lines, and expanded into other major cities in the United States. Peter Widener Mausoleum in Laurel Hill Cemetery He and his business partner, William L. Elkins, invested with businessmen such as Charles Tyson Yerkes, the streetcar czar of Chicago. Widener used the great wealth accumulated from public transportation to become a founding organizer of U.S. Steel and the American Tobacco Company, as well as to acquire substantial holdings in Standard Oil. He is considered to have been among the 100 wealthiest Americans, having left an enormous fortune.The Wealthy 100 He died on November 6, 1915 in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.Laurel Hill Cemetery Personal life In 1858, he married Hannah Josephine Dunton (1836‚Äì1896), and they had three sons. His son George Dunton Widener (1861‚Äì1912) died aboard the RMS Titanic, while son Joseph Early Widener (1871‚Äì1943) was also a noted art collector. His grandson, George D. Widener Jr. (1889-1971), a noted horse racing figure, was also the chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. P. A. B. Widener died at Lynnewood Hall at the age of 80 on November 6, 1915, after having suffered from poor health for three years. After his death, his estate was valued at $31,589,353. By 1945, the accumulated income plus the current value of the real and personal property totaled $98,368,058. =Residences= In 1887, Widener built an ornate mansion (designed by Willis G. Hale) in Philadelphia, at the northwest corner of Broad Street and Girard Avenue. He vacated it 13 years later and donated it (as a memorial for his late wife) to the Free Library of Philadelphia, which used it as a branch library from 1900 to 1946. The building burned in 1980, and it was demolished. In 1900, he completed Lynnewood Hall in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, a 110-room Georgian- style mansion designed by Horace Trumbauer. Widener was an avid art collector, with a collection that included more than a dozen paintings by Rembrandt, as well as works by then-new artists √âdouard Manet and Auguste Renoir.

Hood, Texas under the command of LTC Gerald Saltness. The formal designation was 4th Battalion - 229th Advanced Attack Helicopter Regiment (AAHR). During its time at Ft. Hood, the 4th-229th requested permission from the American Volunteer Group to formally use the \\"Flying Tigers\\" name. The AVG granted that permission and several of the original Flying Tigers, including David \\"Tex\\" Hill, John Richard \\"Dick\\" Rossi and Ed Rector attended the unit activation at Hood AAF in June 1988 (along with a CAF P-40 that landed at Hood AAF for the ceremony). As additional battalions were activated, they too were designated \\"Flying Tigers\\" as the name applied to the Regiment and not just the individual battalions. The unit completed the Apache Training Brigade Unit Training Program in October 1988 and completed a unit move with its 21 AH-64A and 3 UH-60A aircraft to Illesheim, West Germany where it was assigned to the 11th Avn Bde. Upon arrival in Illesheim, the Battalion received 13 refurbished OH-58C Kiowa helicopters.

Bedoya also ran for President of Colombia in the 1998 and 2002 elections. Military career Bedoya's military training began at the Jose Maria C√≥rdova Military Academy in September 1955, where he received the rank of infantry second lieutenant. In 1965 he attended the School of the Americas and trained in military intelligence, later returning in 1979 as a guest professor. In 1987 he was promoted to commander of the Seventh Brigade, Villavicencio, where he developed the plan of dismantling the laboratories and eradication of illicit activities by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ()(FARC). Three years later he was given the position of commander of the Fourth Brigade in Medell√≠n, Antioquia, where he participated in anti- narcotic operations against drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. In 1991 Bedoya was given the position of director of the Superior Military School in Bogot√°, Cundinamarca. The following year he was again promoted to deputy commander of the Northeastern Division, a position he held for three years before being finally promoted in 1996 to commander-in-chief of the armed forces, where he replaced Admiral Holdan Delgado; he held that position for one year. On July 24, 1997, Bedoya was forced into retirement by then President Ernesto Samper due to his unwillingness to negotiate with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Presidential candidacies In 1998 Bedoya announced his candidacy for President of Colombia, running as an independent for the Force Colombia () party he founded. During his campaign he stressed the importance of ridding Colombia of drug smugglers and stated it as his number one priority. Bedoya stated he did not agree with the prior removal of the Colombian National Army from FARC-controlled territory and, stated he would not negotiate with them until their \\"narco-based finances have been squeezed.\\" On April 27, in what was believed to be an attack by rebel groups to destabilize the campaign, five bombs detonated in Bogot√°, one at the campaign headquarters of Bedoya. At the end of the first round of voting Bedoya and running mate Jorge Garcia Hurtado were removed from the running after receiving only 193,037 votes, a total of 1.82%. Conservative Andr√©s Pastrana went on to the second round and, facing off against Liberal Horacio Serpa, eventually became President of Colombia. In the 2002 elections, Bedoya once again participated as a presidential candidate and ran against Horacio Serpa, Luis Eduardo Garz√≥n, Noem√≠ San√≠n, √Ålvaro Uribe and √çngrid Betancourt. Betancourt would later be kidnapped by FARC rebels during the election season. Bedoya's Force Colombia obtained 50,763 votes, 0.459% of the total. √Ålvaro Uribe went on to win the election, representing the Colombia First political party. Controversy =Human rights= General Bedoya was criticized during the later years of his military career for his past attendance at the School of the Americas, as a number of its graduates have committed human rights violations. Bedoya was also accused of tolerating, working with or doing little to combat paramilitary groups.Ej√©rcito Nacional, Hoja de Vida, Harold Bedoya PizarroHuman Rights Watch interview with General Bedoya, Santaf√© de Bogot√°, October 20, 1995 =BINCI and Triple A= Bedoya's service in the Batall√≥n √önico de Inteligencia y Contrainteligencia () (BINCI) of the Colombian National Army has been linked to the activities of the Anticommunist American Alliance () (AAA). The BINCI, acting as AAA, has been accused of carrying out a series of bombings against the Colombian Communist Party's Headquarters and its newspaper Voz Proletaria. The AAA has also been accused of engaging in other kidnappings, bombings and assassinations against leftist targets and abuses of guerrilla detainees during the late 1970s . Then- Lieutenant Colonel Bedoya was mentioned in an open letter published on November 29, 1980 by the Mexican newspaper El D√≠a, in which five individuals identified as former Colombian military detail a number of activities carried out by BINCI personnel operating as Triple A. According to them, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Bedoya, the commander of BINCI, would have given orders to the personnel involved in the bombing of Voz Proletaria. =Legal actions against critics= Bedoya was criticized for filing slander charges against Father Javier Giraldo, the director of the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace (). Human Rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and the Organization of American Studies called these slander suits a measure intended to silence critics.

He then folded the dot-com business and started practicing law briefly as a solo practitioner, whilst doing stand up as a hobby. Stand-up career Since 1996, Usman had a friend who was an amateur comic and he would take him to a comedy club in Minneapolis. This inspired him to write an act in 2000. Usman started performing stand-up comedy in early 2001, a few months before September 11, initially as a hobby. However, in 2004, he had enough bookings to make a run at it. In early 2004, Usman stopped practicing law full-time. He has performed in many major cities in the U.S. as well as in over 20 countries on five continents. In May 2004, Usman along with Preacher Moss and Azeem Muhammad (later replaced by Mohammed Amer in 2006) launched a comedy tour titled Allah Made Me Funny. He also co-wrote and produced a feature-length documentary/concert film based on the live tour, which was theatrically exhibited at Landmark Theatres in over a dozen top US markets in 2008. The film was directed by award-winning documentarian Andrea Kalin and funded by the Unity Productions Foundation. Allah Made Me Funny toured 30 U.S. cities during its first year, and also in Canada, Europe, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Middle East. He has performed in 23 countries on five different continents. Usman and his comedy have been covered by over 100 major world media outlets, including The New York Times, The Economist, CBS Sunday Morning, CNN Headline News, and a whole episode of ABC Nightline.

Mermaid Quay in 2000 Before the completion of the Cardiff Bay Barrage in 1999, Cardiff Bay was tidal, with extensive expanses of mud flats exposed at low tide. Construction of the barrage, one of the largest engineering projects in Europe, has turned Cardiff Bay into a freshwater lake with of waterfront. Mermaid Quay was designed by architects Benoy and opened in August 1999. Since that time there has been significant regeneration of the Bay including the construction of Lloyd George Avenue ‚Äì a new link road between the city centre and the Bay ‚Äì numerous iconic buildings, and residential and commercial developments.

One year later, the bells of a local church started tolling unexpectedly, and a vision of the missing Lucia, clad in a nun‚Äôs habit, appeared before the altar. She told the villagers that she had run away from home to avoid marrying the elderly Count and, having taken nun's vows, had spent the past year tending to the wounded in a foreign land until she was killed by a stray arrow.Corinthia Hotels International, \\"The Legend of Castello Zamittello\\" Castello Zammitello, which was more recently the home of the noble Sant Cassia family, gained notoriety on 27 October 1988 as the site of Baron Francis Sant Cassia's murder, a crime which remains shrouded in mystery.Kurt Sansone and Matthew Vella, \\"Sant Cassia murder: Man Arraigned,\\" online at MaltaToday (9 April 2006) - Retrieved 28 July 2007 Lippija Tower Lippija Tower Lippija Tower is located on the north west coast of Malta, about 100m above sea level. It was built in 1637 upon orders by Grand Master Juan de Lascaris-Castellar. The watch tower formed part of the intricate coastal defence network constructed by the Knights of St. John. For centuries the coastline of Malta has been dotted with lookout posts or watch towers that were built by the Knights of St. John (Knights Hospitaller, Knights of Malta) during the 17th century. These towers were manned nightly to watch the seaward approaches and to raise the alarm in the event of imminent threat. The positioning of these towers was planned as such so that one could see both neighbouring towers, which acted as an early warning system against invaders. As soon as one tower spotted a suspicious event, a fire signal was started which was picked up by the neighbouring towers, in so doing carrying on the message. A number of coastal towers were built during the reigns of Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt (1601‚Äì1622), Grand Master Paul Lascaris-Castellar (1636‚Äì1657) and Grand Master Martin de Redin (1657‚Äì1660). The aim was to strengthen Malta‚Äôs coastal guarding system. Under the reign of Grand Master Juan de Lascaris-Castellar, seven towers were built in the period 1637‚Äì1640. Lascaris paid for the building of these towers out of his own pocket, such was his dedication to fortifying Malta‚Äôs coastal defences. With the exception of St. Agatha‚Äôs Tower in Mellieha (built in Wignacourt‚Äôs style), the Lascaris towers are smaller than Wignacourt‚Äôs and consisted of two storeys, a flat roof and a parapet.

He was the second son of Thomas Henry Hele Phipps (1777‚Äì1841), of Leighton House, Westbury, Wiltshire, and Mary Michael Joseph Leckonby (1777‚Äì1835). In 1837 he went into partnership with his brother, Charles Paul Phipps, buying out the Brazilian coffee business of Heyworth Brothers. Despite a number of alarms, the business eventually flourished, becoming for a while one of the largest coffee exporters from Brazil. Phipps was part-owner of a cargo of coffee shipped from Rio de Janeiro in the Amy Warwick, a merchant vessel that was captured by Unionist forces on 10 July 1861, at the outset of the American Civil War. The resulting legal case ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1862.The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862) In 1868, Phipps was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Westbury, but the election result was declared void as a result of a petition brought by the unsuccessful Liberal Party candidate, Mr Abraham Laverton. Willes J held that, although Phipps himself was personally innocent of any corrupt practice, his agent, Harrop, had carried out acts of intimidation on voters.Law Times Reports relating to Magistrates, Municipal, Parichial, Ecclesiastical and Election Law, vol.5, 1870 Phipps had hoped that his son, Richard Leckonby Hothersall Phipps, would succeed him in the seat. His replacement instead by his brother, Charles Paul Phipps, and (after a Liberal interlude, with the short-lived success of Laverton in 1874) by his nephew, Charles Nicholas Paul Phipps, added to family tensions arising from the conduct of the partnership's affairs. In 1834, Phipps married Mary Anne Barney, by whom he had a son and three daughters. He died in 1870.  References  Sources *Notes on the 'Westbury' Phipps Pedigrees by John C.

The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and springy. Other wire brushes feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle grinders, bench grinders, pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools. Uses wire brush mounted to a bench grinder The wire brush is primarily an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It is also used to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or when it is necessary to clean a harder surface without marring it. Brass bristle brushes are also used in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings. History The origins of the wire brush are unknown, although it is believed that the Romans used similar tools in the manufacture of roof tiles. As the Roman Empire fell, the tool fell out of use. Barbeque grill cleaning A number of surgeons recommend that wire brushes not be used to clean barbecue grills. In some cases, bristles break off the brush which then become deposited in food cooked on the grill. Ingestion of these bristles can cause gastrointestinal perforation. On May 20th, 2020, American food writer and grilling authority Derrick Riches has called for a ban on the manufacture and sale of wire bristle grill cleaning brushes.

Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Paravandellia oxyptera Miranda-Ribeiro, 1912 (Pantanal parasitic catfish) * Paravandellia phaneronema (Miles, 1943)  Distribution  P. oxyptera is distributed in the Paran√°, Paraguay, and Uruguay River basins in Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. P. phaneronema originates from the Magdalena and Cauca River basins of Colombia.  Description  Paravandellia species grow to about in length. Females have been found at TL in January (during the wet season) with about 150 mature oocytes each, and males may have well-developed testes at TL.  Habitat & Habits  P. oxyptera inhabits rivers with sandy to muddy bottom. This species is a parasite. It forages both during the day and at night, seeking the gill chambers of larger fishes, especially catfishes. It enters and leaves the gill chamber during the host's ventilating movements. There, it feeds on blood drawn from the gill filaments and may stay in the gill chamber for 1-3 min. When gorged with blood, the fish moves to the bottom and buries itself in the sand. A single large catfish tethered on the river bank may feed thousand of these parasitic catfish over a period of up to 6 hours. Large numbers of this fish may kill fishes tethered by fishermen.

He played as a winger. Playing career Taylor began his career with his hometown club, Hartlepool United, in 1984. Over two years, he made 47 league appearances for Pools and scored four goals. After a loan spell at Crewe Alexandra in 1985‚Äì86, Taylor signed for Sam Ellis's Blackpool in 1986. He made his debut at Doncaster Rovers on 14 September 1986 in the fourth league game of the 1986‚Äì87 season. Over the course of the season, Taylor made 40 league appearances and scored fourteen goals in a strike partnership with Paul Stewart. In his second season at Blackpool, 1987‚Äì88, Taylor made 41 league appearances and scored 21 goals, finishing as the club's top scorer in the wake of Stewart's departure to Manchester City at the end of the previous season. Taylor suffered an injury in December of the 1988‚Äì89 season that put him out of action for the rest of that campaign and the whole of the next. He started the 1990‚Äì91 season on the bench, but he returned to the starting line-up on 10 November 1990, in a 4‚Äì2 victory over Aldershot at Bloomfield Road. Taylor scored the Seasiders' second goal. His season stopped again shortly thereafter, however, when he missed seven games (the first two under new manager Billy Ayre, who succeeded Graham Carr). He returned in mid-January 1991 and helped the team to a fifth-placed finish in Division Four and qualification for the play-offs. Taylor played in both legs of the semi-final against Scunthorpe United, as well as in the final against Torquay United. It wasn't to be for Blackpool, as the Gulls were victorious in the deciding penalty shoot-out. In 1991‚Äì92, Taylor made only two starts (scoring a goal in each) in Billy Ayre's first full season in charge, before being loaned out to Cardiff City in the New Year. At Ninian Park, Taylor scored three goals in six appearances. In his absence, Blackpool made the play-offs once more, and this time won promotion after another penalty shoot- out. At the end of the 1991‚Äì92 season, Taylor was sold to another Welsh club, Wrexham, where he finished his career. Physio career =Blackpool= Taylor was appointed Physiotherapist at Bloomfield Road in the summer of 1995 where he was to develop a strong relationship with Sam Allardyce and later Gary Megson. Highlights include reaching the playoffs in 1995/96. =Blackburn Rovers= Taylor joined the defending Premier League champions to work alongside England Physiotherapist Alan Smith and it was at this time he first worked with Roy Hodgson, proving influential due to Hodgson's previous exposure to sports science in Italy. During his time at Ewood Park, Taylor also worked under Brian Kidd and Graeme Souness and experienced 2 European campaigns. =Bolton Wanderers= Bolton's return to the top flight coincided with Sam Allardyce re-joining forces with Taylor and appointing him as Head of Sports Science and Medicine. They believed innovation in sport could offer a performance advantage and they set about investing in one of the most respected sports science and medical teams in the Premier League. Highlights included 4 consecutive top 10 finishes, 2 UEFA Cup campaigns and a League Cup final appearance. It was during Bolton's most successful period in modern history that Taylor became instrumental in player recruitment with players such as Fernando Hierro, Ivan Campo and Youri Djorkaeff based at the Euxton Lane training ground. = Newcastle United= After Allardyce became manager of The Magpies, Taylor was appointed Head of Sports Medicine and Science on Tyneside. =Fulham= Being reunited with Roy Hodgson once more as Head of Sports Medicine and Exercise Science, Taylor oversaw Fulham's most successful period in modern history building a department that achieved unrivalled results in injury prevention. Fulham peaked reaching the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final. Promoted to board director in 2012 and becoming Performance Director, Taylor worked closely alongside Mark Hughes who believed \\"this club is at the cutting edge of the modern game.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and after that served in the Soviet Navy as T-337. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-134, Caravan was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-157, on 21 February 1942. She was launched on 27 October 1942 at Portland, Oregon, by Willamette Iron and Steel Works and commissioned on 21 January 1944 with Lieutenant C. E. Walden, USNR, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Caravan stood out of San Francisco, California, on 25 March 1944, bound for Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii and Majuro and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands. She arrived at Eniwetok on 25 April 1944 and began operations as a patrol vessel, lifeguard for aviators downed during aircraft carrier strikes, and convoy escort. Her escort duties took her throughout the Mariana Islands, and in September 1944 she was rebased there at Guam. She moved to Ulithi in October 1944 - riding out a severe typhoon en route - to begin operations in the Palau Islands as well as the Marianas. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Caravan arrived at Portland, Oregon, in May 1945 for a pre-transfer overhaul. In July 1945 she arrived at Cold Bay to train her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Caravan was decommissioned on 17 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-337 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Caravan to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-157 on 7 February 1955. Disposal T-337 was scrapped in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Caravan on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

A typical incentive trust might encourage a beneficiary to complete a degree, enter a profession, or abstain from harmful conduct such as substance abuse. The beneficiary might be paid a certain amount of money from the trust upon graduating from college, or the trust might pay a dollar of income from the trust for every dollar the beneficiary earns. Although incentive trusts have apparently become more common in the early 21st century, a 2007 survey found that less than one-third of wealthy Americans attach conditions to the distribution of their estates. According to Joshua Tate, an assistant professor at SMU Dedman School of Law, incentive trusts pose a problem of inflexibility: \\"because the settlor cannot foresee all potential eventualities or circumstances and take them into account in the trust, the terms of the trust can prove to be a burden for the beneficiaries.\\" Eileen Gallo, a noted psychotherapist, has argued that, although incentive trusts may be effective in changing behavior, they may in fact be damaging to the beneficiaries, in that they rely on external motivation to encourage activities that should be autotelic in nature. The seeming popularity of incentive trusts, however, is reflected in the many websites created by estate planners to market them.

His mining operations are recounted to this day as an outstanding example of what may be done with a rich ore body and a genius for stock manipulation. Flood piled up millions as one of the famed \\"Bonanza Kings\\" and is considered to have been one of the 100 wealthiest Americans, leaving an enormous fortune. He is famous for two mansions, the James C. Flood Mansion at 1000 California St. in San Francisco, and Linden Towers located in Menlo Park, torn down in 1936.  Biography  James Clair Flood was born on Staten Island, N.Y. to Irish immigrant parents. He had an eighth grade education, and was then apprenticed to a New York carriage maker. In 1849 he sailed for San Francisco and the Gold Rush. After some success in the mines, he returned east to marry Mary Emma Leary of County Wexford, Ireland. They were back in San Francisco by 1854. Flood had two children, Jennie who never married, and James L. born in 1857. James L. had a son, James Flood born in 1900, and a daughter, Mary Emma Flood (Mrs. Theodore) Stebbins born in 1908, by his second wife. As a tribute to his father, James L. built the Flood Building on San Francisco's Market Street, which in 2003 was still owned by the Flood family.  Beginning of a fortune  In 1857 James Flood opened a saloon with partner William S. O'Brien on Washington street in San Francisco. In 1858 they sold the saloon and went into business as stockbrokers. After the discovery of silver in Nevada in 1859, the partners began investing in mining stocks. The following year, Flood and O'Brien formed a partnership with fellow Irishmen James Graham Fair, a mine superintendent, and John William Mackay, a mining engineer. None of the four had impressed themselves on others than their immediate circle of friends and acquaintances until some time in the seventies they joined forces in operating the Consolidated Virginia and the California claims in the Comstock Lode. Mackay and Fair had the mining knowledge and Flood and O'Brien raised the money. The purchase price of the claims, later to become a fabulous source of wealth, was about $100,000. The original stock issue was 10,700 shares, selling for between $4 and $5 a share.  Stock gambling fever  The new firm gained control of the 'Consolidated Virginia Mining Company' stock in 1873, and it was in this mine that the greatest silver bonanza in history was discovered in 1873. The ore body was more than 1,200 feet deep, which yielded in March of that year as much as $632 per ton. A little while after uncovering the \\"big bonanza\\" the price of the stock went skyward. Flood is traditionally credited with having directed the subsequent proceedings so far as stock market operations were concerned. San Francisco and the entire mining world were hurtled into a fever of excitement by proof of early reports of richness of the mining claims. The first stock issue was converted into two issues of 108,000 shares each, and by the middle of 1875 the speculative value of the two mines were close to $1,000,000,000. Shares went as high as $710. It was said that in the first six months of 1875 the output of the mines averaged $1,500,000 monthly. Seats on the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board jumped to $25,000 each as a result of the excitement. Varied interests sought to obtain stock control of the rich properties and there came the inevitable crash in which many went to financial doom. The \\"Bonanza Kings\\" profited, however, and late in 1875 Flood and O'Brien sought to become leaders in finance. After producing $133,471,000, the Consolidated Virginia and California mines could not be operated profitably, but in the language of the street, the owners had \\"caught them coming and going.\\"  Bank of Nevada  The Bonanza firm was said to be held together by Flood, though he was the most unpopular of the partners with the public, and was regarded by some as a stock manipulator. The advent of Flood and O'Brien, operating independently of Fair and Mackay, into the financial field met fierce resistance from William Sharon and William C. Ralston of the Bank of California. As a result of a battle between the two groups, the Bank of California failed and Flood and O'Brien started the Nevada Bank. From that time on finance more than mining engaged Flood's time, and much of his wealth went into real estate. Dissension and an ill-fated attempt to corner the world wheat market in 1887 cost the firm millions. William Alvord, President of the Bank of California, in 1887 warned James C. Flood of signs of irregularities at the Nevada Bank, enabling Flood to avert the collapse of the Nevada Bank following the speculation of its cashier in the wheat market.Noel M.

Founders of the party were nationalist and anti-Communist dissidents. The initiative to establish Estonian National Independence Party came from Vello V√§√§rtn√µu, the leader of an Estonian Buddhist Brotherhood group. On 30 January 1988 he organized a press conference in Moscow for Western media where he announced the formation of ENIP, aimed at re-establishing independence of the Estonian Republic as a nation state on the restitution principle. This made the ENIP the most radical or political movement of its day. Vaartnou and fellow Buddhists were expelled from the Soviet Union shortly after the press conference and ENIP was officially founded in August 1988 in Pilistvere.(Simons, Westerlund \\"Religion, Politics and Nation-Building in Post-Communist Countries\\" It was the first non-communist political party in the Soviet Union.

In Nikki's book The Heroin Diaries, a journal entry states that Tommy Lee was playing the song on the piano, and Nikki wrote the lyrics for the piano part. Music video The video (which was shot in black- and-white) depicts a man killing a woman with a kitchen knife (off-screen). He then takes a picture of her off the wall with his hand, which is covered in blood, and throws it in the fireplace. After the murder, the man begins having a breakdown, and destroys many objects in his house. The camera zooms around and shows a stove and pots, a sink, empty picture frames on the floor and a picture of Jimi Hendrix. The police then arrive to arrest him. Paramedics put the dead woman in a body bag and the man is hauled away in front of many onlookers. Though the murder was not shown on screen, the video was banned from MTV due to the violent nature of the lyrics. The video was directed by Wayne Isham.

The son of Nadejda Dimov and Naum Mordcovici, he was one of the main representatives (together with, amongst others, Dumitru »öepeneag) of onirism in Romanian poetry, explorer of the dream as an absolute, objective reality. He graduated from the Saint Sava High School in Bucharest. Then he studied for three years at the philology department of the University of Bucharest. Without graduating, he studied again for three years at the biology department. After a dispute (it seems that he questioned at a seminar the logic of Michurinist science) he was expelled. He also followed courses in law and mathematics at the same University of Bucharest. In 1957 he was arrested for urinating on a statue of Joseph Stalin in Bucharest, but was released after two months due to lack of evidence.Ion Bogdan Lefter in the foreword to Leonid Dimov, ‚ÄûOpera poeticƒÉ‚Äù, vol. I-II, Editura Paralela 45, 2010, p. 10 His literary debut came rather late, in 1965, when he published some poems in the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ magazine, where »òerban Cioculescu, Dimovs old French teacher, had become chief editor. Soon after, Miron Radu Paraschivescu, the editor in charge of the literary supplement \\"Poveste vorbei\\" of the Ramuri magazine in Craiova, also let Dimov publish some poems. His first book, Versuri (\\"Poems\\"), was published in December 1966. After becoming a member of the Writers' Union of Romania, he was hired as an editor at the Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ magazine in 1970, where he worked until 1975, when he went into early retirement due to illness. He was married twice: the first time, to Lucia Salam (with whom he had a daughter, Tatiana, born in 1952), and the second time, to Ana-Marina Voinescu (whose daughter, Ileana- born in 1957 from her marriage to Teodor P√¢c«é- he would adopt as his own child). He continued to publish until shortly before his death, the last published poems being Sonete pentru Irina (\\"Sonets for Irina\\"), dedicated to his granddaughter Irina (Ileana's daughter). In an age and society where many Romanian poets and writers compromised their conscience in order to be able to publish more, Dimov was not an outright political dissident, but rather a nonconformist, one of the few who refused to praise the regime, a fact that brought him to the attention of the Romanian secret police, the feared Securitate.Dorin Tudoran, Eu, fiul lor.

It originates from a reservoir in Kattinakere. The Kattinakere reservoir's overflow canal turns into a creek gathering strength on its way to become the river Dandavati. The river flows via Kuppe and joins the Varada river at a place called Bankasana near Anavatti. Varada, in turn, joins Tungabhadra and later Krishna River which finally joins the Bay of Bengal in the East coast of India. Sorab's Sri Ranganatha Temple is built on the bank of the Dandavati river.  Myth  Old myth says that when Sri Ramachandra, Seetha and Lakamana were in exile, they travelled through Sorab. Seetha felt thirsty and Sri Ramachandra made a hole out of ground to find water. The water then became the river.

This Project irrigates 50,500 acres of Agricultural and Forest land. Farmers who feared displacement from the project had staged protests and saying that the implementation of this project is non-viable but for political gains. The controversy was used by the politicians during the Parliament and local bodies election also. Sources in the Department of Water Resource said the water level in the river that come under the Krishna valley need to be utilised as per the directions of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, there were legal hurdles in implementing the Dandavati project The Dandavati Virodhi Horata Samiti which has launched a struggle against the project says the project is being implemented for political reasons. It questions the rationale behind irrigating dry lands by submerging fertile agricultural land and rain forest. Farmers says that If the government is so keen on irrigating the taluk, it should implement the Bythanala irrigation project which was planned in the Seventies.

Egyptian Australians are Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents of Egyptian descent. According to the Australian 2011 Census, 36,532 Australian citizens and permanent residents declared that they were born in Egypt, while based on the 2006 Census, at least an additional 31,786 declared that they were of full or partial Egyptian ancestry and born in a country other than Egypt (including most numerously Australian-born persons of full or partial Egyptian ancestry). The 2006 Census shows that the majority of Egypt-born Australians are located in Sydney (16,238) or Melbourne (11,156), with smaller communities located in Perth (1,407), Adelaide (982) and Brisbane (897). The majority of Egyptian Australians are Christians, which is in contrast to the religious affiliation to Islam of the majority of the population of ethnic Egyptians within modern Egypt. Centuries of a steady continuous persecution of Copts and conversions of the local indigenous Egyptian population has resulted in modern Egypt's Muslim majority, although the indigenous Christian Church of Egypt has retained a sizeable minority throughout its history, up until today. Christians comprise much of the Egyptian diaspora, both in Australia and elsewhere. The majority religion of Egypt before the introduction of Islam from Arabia was Christianity, and prior to introduction of Christianity to Egypt the majority religion was the Ancient Egyptian religion. Some 19,928 Australian citizens and residents declared membership of the Coptic Orthodox Church at the 2006 Census. Most Egyptian Christians, however, may simply have declared themselves \\"Christian\\" without specifying the Coptic denomination, while other Egyptian Christians may belong to various other denominations, either born into or converted. In 2003, however, it was claimed in the New South Wales Parliament that there were in fact 70,000 Copts in New South Wales alone. An additional 1,890 persons in the 2006 Census reported themselves as being of \\"Coptic\\" ancestry. The term Coptic ordinarily refers to adherents of Coptic Christianity, but when used as a term referring to ethnicity means \\"Egyptian\\" (almost always in the context of Coptic Christian Egyptians). The 1,890 persons who described their ancestry as \\"Coptic\\" are thus most likely Egyptian Australians. Copt as an ethnonym is etymologically derived from the Greek \\"Aiguptious,\\" literally meaning \\"Egyptian,\\" from the Late Egyptian word \\"Gyptios\\", via the Classical Arabic \\"Qubt\\", into the English \\"Copt\\". The word ordinarily refers to Coptic Christian Egyptians, though there have been instances of Muslim Egyptians referring to themselves as \\"Copts\\" to emphasise the non-Arabian ancestral origin of Egyptians in general. History First history of short term Egyptians migrants in Australia dates back to 1860s to 1900 period when small groups of mainly Muslim cameleers were shipped in and out of Australia at three-year intervals, to service South Australia's inland pastoral industry by carting goods and transporting wool bales by camel trains, who were commonly referred to as \\"Afghans\\" or \\"Ghans\\", despite their origin often being mainly from British India, and some even from Afghanistan and Egypt and Turkey.australia.gov.au > About Australia > Australian Stories > Afghan cameleers in Australia . Accessed 8 May 2014. Permanent emigration from Egypt began in the late 1940s and 1950s, disproportionately so for non-ethnic Egyptian minorities escaping the growing Arab nationalist movement in Egypt which saw the overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy and the subsequent Suez Crisis. In total numbers, Egyptian Christians were the largest contingent of emigrants to leave Egypt for other countries, including to Australia. Christians were the second largest in terms of proportion to their original community size in Egypt. Egyptian Jews, as a proportion of their original community size in Egypt, were the largest emigrant community to leave Egypt (they were the second largest in total numbers). The number of Jews in Egypt numbered around 75,000 in 1948, and following the establishment of the State of Israel that same year, almost the entire population left in the subsequent years during the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, settling largely in Israel, USA, Europe, Latin America, and around 2,000 settling in Australia. The Egyptian Jewish population in Australia is concentrated particularly in Adelaide, South Australia. Officially, only 6 Jews remain in Egypt today.
