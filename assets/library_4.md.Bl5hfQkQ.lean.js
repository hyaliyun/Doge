Wicks as he appeared shortly before his death in 1956. Herbert Moore \\"Harry\\" Wicks (1889–1956), best known as \\"Harry M. Wicks,\\" was an American radical journalist and politician who was a founding member of the Communist Party of America. He was a plenipotentiary representative of the Communist International to Australia in 1930-31 and there directed the reorganization of the structure and leadership of the Communist Party of Australia. Biography =Early years= Harry M. Wicks is one of the most enigmatic leaders of the early American communist movement. Wicks was born in Arcola, Illinois on December 10, 1889, the son of an electrical engineer.Solon DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925. Page 249. He attended primary school in Arcola and grammar school in Algona and Des Moines, Iowa.DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who, pg. 249. He worked as a journeyman compositor in the printing industry. =Political activism= Harry Wicks was an adherent of the John Keracher's Proletarian University tendency in the Socialist Party of Michigan from 1916.Oakley C. Johnson, \\"The Early Socialist Party of Michigan: An Assignment in Autobiography,\\" Ann Arbor, MI: The Centennial Review, v. 10, no. 2 (Spring 1966), pg. 159. Wicks was the candidate of the Socialist Party of Oregon for the US House of Representatives in the state's 3rd District in November 1918. Early the next year he was one of 28 candidates who ran for the SPA's governing National Executive Committee, failing to win election. Wicks was the organizerMichael Munk, The Portland Red Guide: Sites and Stories of Our Radical Past. Portland, OR: Ooligan Press, 2007. and served as the President of the short-lived Council of Workers, Soldiers, and Sailors in Portland, Oregon in 1919. Wicks was also the editor of The Western Socialist in this period. When Wicks was replaced by a member of the local Foundry Workers' Union as President of the Council, he left the group, which expired after approximately 6 months of existence. Wicks was a delegate to Founding Convention of Communist Party of America and on the 9 member committee which wrote the CPA Program in 1919.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957; pg. 184. The founding convention elected Wicks to the Central Executive Committee of the CPA, which in turn elected him to its governing inner circle, the Executive Council.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957; pp. 184, 427 Wicks was the only member of the Michigan tendency to accept office in the new CPA. He also served as Associate Editor of the party's official organ, The Communist. Wicks was jailed in Nov. 1919 in connection with these activities as part of the Justice Department's crackdown on members of the Communist Party. In 1920, Wicks rejoined his Michigan comrades when he became a member of the Proletarian Party of America, serving on the governing National Executive Committee of that organization. Wicks was the fraternal delegate of the PPA to the founding convention of the Workers Party of America in Dec. 1921, but he came as a foe rather than a friend, engaging in a bitter criticism of that organization. After the Proletarian Party's decision to support the legal arm of the Central Caucus faction's \\"Communist Party of America\\" in 1922, Wicks was named as the editor of the organ of this \\"United Toilers of America,\\" The Workers' Challenge.James P. Cannon, The First Ten Years of American Communism: Report of a Participant. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1960; pp. 45-46. This publication was later recalled as home to \\"the most violent and vituperative polemics in America,\\" provoking one Communist Party wag to refer to their rivals as the \\"United Toilets.\\"Benjamin Gitlow, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. New York: E.P. Dutton & Co., 1940. Page 133. \\"United Toilets\\" quote attributed by Gitlow to Jay Lovestone. The bitterness between Wicks' organization and the Communist Party proved short-lived, however. Along with most of his United Toilers comrades, Harry Wicks joined the Workers Party of America following the liquidation of the Central Caucus split in the summer of 1922. The hatchet was quickly buried. Harry Wicks was named to the governing Central Executive Committee of the WPA by the party's December 1922 convention, as well as to the 11 man \\"Executive Council\\" which handled day-to-day operations of the party.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 457, fn. 32. He was also named to the editorial board of the party's weekly newspaper The Worker at that time. He also delivered the report on the printing trades to the first annual convention of William Z. Foster's Trade Union Educational League in August 1922.Gitlow, I Confess,\\" pg. 174. The year 1923 also saw Harry Wicks named National Organizer for the WPA. In the fall of that year he conducted a 5-week East Coast speaking tour on behalf of the party. Wicks was a delegate to the 3rd Convention of the WPA in 1923 and was a consistent backer of the Pepper- Ruthenberg faction. In the summer of 1923, Wicks was sent by the governing Central Executive Committee of the Workers Party to Minnesota to attempt to negotiate an alliance with William Mahoney, a newspaper editor and Farmer- Labor Party veteran and a number of his colleagues. However, Wicks clashed with local Communists in Minneapolis and it ultimately fell to machinist Clarence Hathaway to broker the deal.Theodore Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia. New York: Viking, 1960. Page 100. In 1923 Wicks was accused of having acted as agent provocateur in 1919, charged with having denounced Communist Labor Party of America founding member Victor Saulit to immigration authorities while both were members of the Socialist Party of Oregon A WPA inquest commission cleared Wicks of this charge, however.Bryan Palmer, James P. Cannon and the Origins of the American Revolutionary Left, 1890-1928. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007. Page 430, fn. 14. In the summer of 1924, Wicks was involved as a leader of the Paterson Broad Silk strike, which began on August 12. In 1924 Wicks was the United States House of Representatives elections, 1924#New York candidate of the Workers Party for U.S. Congress in the New York 23rd District. Two years later he was the party's nominee for Governor of Pennsylvania.\\"Workers Party Enters Candidates in State Elections This Year,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 3, no. 211 (September 20, 1926), pg. 4. In 1928 Wicks was a delegate to the 6th World Congress of the Comintern.Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. 366. Wicks returned to Moscow at the end of 1928 as the American Communist Party's representative to the Profintern. As a representative in Moscow, Wicks was expected to take the lead arguing the controversial positions of American party Executive Secretary Jay Lovestone, leader of the faction to which Wicks professed loyalty. However, given Wicks' uneven past in the factional wars, this was, as historian Theodore Draper has noted, \\"a strange choice in an emergency.\\"Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia, pg. 386. In 1929 the Executive Committee of the Communist International called the American party leadership onto the carpet over the claim of Lovestone and his top associates that the American party was entitled to follow their own particular path to revolution due to the national exceptionalism of the largest country in the capitalist world. A large delegation was dispatched to Moscow, a group which included the representative to the Profintern, Harry Wicks. Lovestone and his associate Benjamin Gitlow refused to accept the admonishment of the Comintern and were subsequently expelled. Wicks chose to accept the Comintern's position, however, and he remained in Moscow. He would subsequently be sent abroad to root out the similar political heresy in Australia.Stuart Macintyre, The Reds: The Communist Party of Australia from Origins to Illegality. Sydney, Australia: Allen and Unwin, 1998. Pp. 170-171. In the fall of 1929 Wicks returned to the United States briefly, running as a Communist for president of the New York City board of aldermen.\\"Wicks Assails Strike Terror,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 191 (Oct. 17, 1929), pg. 1. =Comintern representative= In April 1930, Harry M. Wicks, using the pseudonym \\"Herbert Moore,\\" his given and middle names, arrived in Sydney, Australia as a plenipotentiary representative of the Comintern.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 170. Wicks made use of the mechanism of self-criticism — ritual public confession of failings by \\"errant\\" individuals — as a means of instilling ideological uniformity and party discipline.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 170. The best memoir account of the process of self-criticism may be found in Wolfgang Leonhard's Die Revolution entlässt ihre Kinder (1957), published in English as Child of the Revolution (1957). Leonhard was a Comintern functionary in Moscow, as was Harry Wicks, and his account of the process of \\"criticism/self-criticism\\" in the Comintern school is illuminating. Australian party leaders Jack Ryan and Jack Kavanagh were two who ran afoul of Wicks during the reorganization.Macintyre, The Reds, pp. 171-175. In April 1931 the Australian Communist Party held its 10th Congress and completed the reorganization begun by Wicks in the previous year. Former state branches were reconstituted into 8 numbered districts, each of which was further divided into numbered sub-districts. At every level a committee supervised the work of the subordinate level and all communication was mandated to be made hierarchically, with sideways communication between units of a particular level prohibited. At the top of the new party hierarchy would sit a secretariat of just three members.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 177. This new model replicated the structure of the American Communist Party in this period, which was also headed by a 3 man secretariat. Criticism of Wicks was publicly voiced at this Congress. Australian Communist Ted Tripp declared to the delegates that he had met American students at the Comintern's Lenin School who considered Wicks a \\"huge joke\\" and revealed that Wicks had asked him to feign friendship with Jack Kavanagh in order to root out his factional plans. Tripp was revolted by the suggestion.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 178. Delegate Jack Loughran, one of the most outspoken dissidents in the Australian Communist Party, declared that \\"the Party is being reduced to a party of gramophones that will only play one record — it must be 'Moore's Melody.\\" For his part Harry Wicks, who opened the Congress with a keynote speech lasting four hours, congratulated the loyal majority for conducting a discussion which \\"annihilated\\" the arguments of the dissidents. \\"We are going to have one monolithic whole,\\" Wicks confidently predicted.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 178. Wick's speech was subsequently published in pamphlet form by the Communist Party of Australia as Australia and the World Crisis. His reorganizational task finished, Wicks left Australia in July 1931. It bears mentioning that Harry Wicks' well documented Comintern mission in Australia may not have been his only task abroad for Moscow. In his 1940 memoir, former member of the Secretariat of the CPUSA Benjamin Gitlow asserted that \\"H.M. Wicks went on special missions to Germany and Central America.\\"Gitlow, I Confess, pg. 304. This assertion by Gitlow is unconfirmed.Historian Theodore Draper indicates that Wicks was used by the CI \\"in Australia and elsewhere.\\" Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia, pp. 170-171. =Return to American politics= Historian Harvey Klehr asserts that Harry Wicks was the Communist Party's District Organizer for a district which included Chattanooga, Tennessee in the summer of 1931, using the pseudonym \\"Allen.\\" This matter remains less than certain.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984. Pages 46, 422-423. Footnote 47 on pp. 422-423 details the confusing situation over the use of the \\"Allen\\" pseudonym. Harry Wicks reemerged in American politics during the middle 1930s. In 1934 Wicks was the CPUSA's candidate for US Senate from Pennsylvania.Wicks did not do well. In the Socialist Party hotbed of Reading, PA, Wicks polled exactly 53 votes in the November 1934 election, compared to 11,835 for James Maurer of the Socialist Party, 10,303 for the Democratic candidate, and 8,176 for the Republican. See: \\"Official Vote Shows City Strong Socialist,\\" Reading Labor Advocate, vol.37, no. 17 (November 23, 1934), pg. 1. In 1937, Harry Wicks was expelled from the Communist Party on the basis of charges made by the Chicago Federation of Labor that he was a spy.Palmer, James P. Cannon and the Origins of the American Revolutionary Left, pg. 430, fn. 14. This time the charges stuck and Wicks was expelled. Adding insult to injury, the old accusation which he had dodged in 1923 was revisited and it was declared that Wicks had been a spy ever since joining the party in 1919.Fred Stanton (ed.), James P. Cannon, Writings and Speeches, 1928-31: The Left Opposition in the US, 1928-31. New York: Monad Press, 1981. Page 423. Historian Theodore Draper later claimed, on the basis of a review of Wicks' private papers, that there was actually no convincing evidence of the veracity of these charges — which may well have been influenced by the spy-mania of the Great Purges then sweeping the Soviet Union. Following his expulsion, Harry Wicks moved to Chicago and worked there as a typesetter until his death in 1956. He spoke periodically under the auspices of the Independent Labor League of America, the final incarnation of the Communist oppositional movement headed by Jay Lovestone, teaching a fortnightly \\"study class\\" on the subject of \\"Present Day Capitalism\\" in early 1939.See: Advertisement for \\"Study Class on 'Present Day Capitalism,'\\" Workers Age, vol.8, no. 4 (January 28, 1939), pg. 3. Shortly after his death a book by Wicks was published on the history of the Russian Revolution and world communist movement, arguing was it had been \\"completely negated into an instrument for the degradation and enslavement of those who toil.\\"H.M. Wicks, Eclipse of October. Chicago: Challenge Publishers, 1957. Page v. Views of Harry M. Wicks by his contemporaries * Oakley C. Johnson, a member of the Socialist Party of Michigan and founding member of the Communist Party of America along with Harry Wicks was a bitter critic of his views and personality traits. In a 1966 memoir, Johnson recalled: > Another Keracher adherent, but a strange and undependable one, was Harry M. > Wicks, for whom I bore a secret dislike. He was a master of profanity and > invective, and his speeches and articles were full of both. He had > extraordinary intellectual vanity (knew everything, was always right), and > very little charm. He was a fattish man, with plump hips, eyes that were > round and small, and a red face.Oakley C. Johnson, \\"The Early Socialist > Party of Michigan,\\" pg. 159. * Benjamin Gitlow, a former member of the Secretariat of the CPUSA who later turned to conservative anti-communism emphasized Wick's aggressiveness as a soapbox speaker at the Passaic Textile Strike of 1926: > The [Textile] Committee had sent Mary Heaton Vorse to Washington to line up > Congressional support for a Congressional Investigation of Passaic... Mrs. > Vorse also sharply attacked H.M. Wicks for the kind of a speech he made > before the strikers, Wicks had the reputation of being the most vitriolic > speaker in the party.

Dominica's tourist industry is in its infancy compared to other Caribbean islands. For many years its rugged terrain, lack of white beaches, and underdeveloped infrastructure prevented large-scale tourist development. In recent years, Dominica has successfully marketed itself as the \\"nature island of the Caribbean,\\" seeking to attract eco-tourists interested in landscapes and wildlife. The government realizes that intensive tourism is incompatible with preserving the island's eco-system and in 1997 signed an agreement with Green Globe, the environmental division of the World Travel and Tourism Council, to develop the island as a \\"model ecotourism destination.\\" The 3-year program provided technical expertise on environmental management as well as helping to market Dominica through specialist travel companies. At the same time, the government has encouraged a steady increase in Dominica's tourism capacity, with numerous new hotels being built and considerable investment in cruise ship facilities. The new cruise ship jetty at Prince Rupert Bay, near Portsmouth, has dramatically increased the number of ships calling annually and brought significant tourism-related opportunities to the formerly depressed community of Portsmouth. Annual tourist arrivals are estimated at approximately 200,000, of whom about 75,000 are stay-over visitors. The great majority are cruise ship visitors who spend limited time and money on the island. Revenues from tourism reached US$49 million in 1999. Compared to many other Caribbean islands, Dominica's tourism industry may be considered to be underdeveloped (65,000 visitors per year). It does not have any world-famous chains of hotels. However, Dominica has a few famous tourist spots, such as the Indian River in Portsmouth, Emerald Pool, Trafalgar Falls, Scotts Head (where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Caribbean Sea), and the world's second-largest boiling lake, which is inside Morne Trois Pitons National Park. The national park, itself, has been designated a World Heritage Site. A 2005 New York Times article reported that locals, who believe an earthquake to be the most likely culprit, claim the boiling lake had diminished in volume and effect (in the sense of impressing visitors) in recent years. This island country also has many diving spots with steep drop- offs, healthy marine environment, and reefs. In 2004, because of its natural environment, Dominica was chosen to be one of the primary filming locations for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and its follow-up, At World's End. Hampstead Beach, Indian River, Londonderry River, Soufriere, and Vieille Case, which is situated on the island's northern tip, were among the places selected for filming. The production ended on May 26, 2005. The cast and crew and their island hosts had a \\"Dominica Survivor Party\\". Celebrity Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruise Lines and Oceania Cruise Lines have made Dominica one of their ports of call. The pier is located in the capital city of Roseau and is a simple pier. Other Caribbean islands—such as St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Lucia, and Antigua—have more extensive cruise pier facilities. The Dominica straw markets open on Tuesdays when the cruise ship docks. These shops are operated by locals and are located on the main street directly in front of the pier, as well as directly behind the Dominica Museum.

More than 150 different chemicals, including BCEE (Bis-2-Chloroethyl ether), benzene, 1,2 Dichloroethylene, arsenic, lead and mercury have been identified at the site. In September 1985, the EPA filed lawsuits against seven companies, including Rohm & Haas, to recover the costs of the remediation at the site. Approximately of contaminated water had been leaking from the site on a daily basis, leaching into groundwater or washed away in the rain. In 1983, following the construction of a wall constructed around the center of the dump site, seepage was reduced to per day. The contaminated areas at the dump site were also covered with a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cap. In 1992 a treatment plant was constructed to flush the landfill. By 1996 off-site work including excavation of the marsh, portions of the stream bed, and the lake sediment excavation was completed. Drains to capture contaminated water from outside and below the landfill were completed which must be operated indefinitely. These drains have successfully protected the surrounding environment from landfill contaminants and are constantly monitored to insure their effectiveness. Today, remediation continues at the Landfill through the removal of vast quantities of volatile organic compounds, such as benzene and toluene. These compounds are removed in the vapor phase and destroyed. To date (2010) over of contaminants have been removed from Lipari. Effects In the mid-1980s, the Borough of Pitman closed a playground at Betty Park, an area adjoining Alcyon Lake, as the levels of hazardous chemicals present in the soil were higher than safety levels established at the Federal level. A study performed by the New Jersey Department of Health in 1989 showed that those living within one kilometer of the dump site were at greater risk of adult leukemia and of giving birth to low birth weight babies than those living further away.via Associated Press. \\"Landfill Linked to Cases of Leukemia and Low Birth Weight\\", The New York Times, February 5, 1989. Accessed January 14, 2009. A follow-up study by medical investigators released in 1997 reviewing details of 9,000 children born to parents living near the dump site found clear evidence of a link to the toxic chemicals and a significant drop in birth weight and a risk of pre- term delivery that was twice as high as normal. The increased effects peaked for those children born between 1971 and 1975, a period when the contaminants leaking from the site were at their peak. The study also found that after the dump was closed and cleanup began, birth weights increased until they were higher than those from surrounding areas in the most recent data. The peer- reviewed studies were included in Environmental Health Perspectives, a monthly journal published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.Revkin, Andrew C. \\"Ex-Toxic Dump Is Linked To Rise in Birth Problems\\", The New York Times, September 11, 1997. Accessed January 14, 2009. Remediation In March 1994, Rohm and Haas reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice under which the firm would address its liability for the materials it dumped there by spending an estimated $50 million to clean up the landfill site.Staff. \\"COMPANY NEWS; ROHM & HAAS TO SPEND $50 MILLION TO CLEAN UP WASTE SITE\\", The New York Times, March 17, 1994. Accessed January 14, 2009. The cleanup project was estimated to have run in excess of $100 million by 1995, with the majority of costs paid by the companies that had material dumped at the site. Barrels for which manufacturers paid about 75 cents each as a fee to the landfill owner ended up costing around $2,000 per barrel to remove the contaminants from the soil.Nordheimer, John. \\"Residue of Fear Remains as Toxins Are Removed\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1994. Accessed January 14, 2009. About 90,000 tons of contaminated soil was removed from the off-site areas temporarily stored at the site of a former stock car race track in Pitman and later sent to a properly lined landfill. In 1995, Pitman's Alcyon Lake was drained and the sediment at the lake's bottom was removed for storage at the race track and later shipped offsite. Over a fifteen-year period, millions of gallons of water were pumped into the landfill to carry the toxic material through a system of pipes and into a pre-treatment facility that would treat the chemicals carried off in the leachate.EPA Lipari Landfill Effluent from the plant was then sent to the local utility authority.Lipari Landfill Remediation References Superfund sites in New Jersey Geography of Gloucester County, New Jersey ","title":"Lipari Landfill"},{"id":"21096949","text":"Gene Deer is an American blues, rock, and country musician/singer/songwriter based out of Indianapolis, Indiana.

In a career which lasted from June 1910 to May 1911 he ran nine times and won six races. He won the 2000 Guineas Stakes and followed with a win in The Derby. Background Sunstar was a medium-sized dark bay or brown horse bred by his owner Jack Joel. He was sired by Sundridge out of a mare named Doris. Sundridge had been a specialist sprinter, excelling over five and six furlongs which led some commentators to doubt his son's ability to stay middle distances. Sundridge had not made an impressive start to his stud career and had been sold to a French breeding syndicate in September 1910, before Sunstar's achievements made his potential evident. He was the Champion sire in 1911, and sired many other good winners, although most of them did better over shorter distances. Doris was a poor racehorse who never rose above selling company, but proved a highly successful broodmare: in the year of Sunstar's Derby win she produced a filly named Princess Dorrie who won the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks in 1914. Joel sent his colt to the stable of his private trainer Charles Morton at Wantage in Oxfordshire. Racing career =1910: two-year- old season= Sunstar showed useful form in winning three of his six races as a two-year-old in 1910. He began his career at Royal Ascot in June when he ran fourth in the New Stakes, a race now known as the Norfolk Stakes. He recorded his first win in the Exeter Stakes at Newmarket and then finished second to St Nat in a race at Goodwood before winning the International Plate at Kempton. In the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster he finished third to Pietri. He returned to Newmarket for the Hopeful Stakes and produced his best performance of the season when dead-heating with Borrow, a colt who went on to win the Middle Park Stakes in October. =1911: three-year-old season= In the winter and early spring of 1911, Sunstar began to make rapid progress and Morton decided to test the colt in a private trial race at Wantage. On the morning of Good Friday, 14 April, Sunstar was pitted against two good older horses The Story and Spanish Prince and won impressively. The form of the trial looked even better when both of the beaten horses won important handicap races in the subsequent weeks. News of the supposedly private trial soon became public, and when Sunstar appeared at Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas twelve days later, he started the 5/1 second favourite in a field of fourteen runners. Ridden by the French jockey George Stern, he won by two lengths from, Lord Derby's colt Stedfast in a race record time of 1:37.6. Two weeks after his win in the Guineas, Sunstar was moved up to ten furlongs to run in the Newmarket Stakes, despite the concerns of his trainer, who felt that the unusually hard ground presented a risk of injury to the colt's legs. He won the race from Beaurepaire and Persephone, showing that despite his pedigree, he had the stamina for middle distances and confirming his position as favourite for the Derby. Jack Joel: he insisted on running Sunstar in the Derby. Nine days before the Derby Sunstar pulled up lame in his right foreleg after a training gallop. He had sustained an injury to the suspensory ligaments or the \\"back tendons\\" so painful that he was unable to put any weight on the injured leg, making his participation at Epsom extremely doubtful. Morton worked on the injury for the next week, with one treatment involving wrapping the affected leg in cabbage leaves. He was able to deal with the superficial lameness, but informed Joel that the underlying condition remained and that although Sunstar would be able to run in the Derby, any further aggravation of the injury would almost certainly end the horses career. Joel took the decision to run Sunstar, whatever the long-term consequences. In the build-up to the race there were rumours that Sunstar was the target of a plot to prevent his runnining, orchestrated either by Joel's personal enemies or by unscrupulous bookmakers who stood to lose heavily if the colt were successful. Joel responded by ensuring the Wantage stables were subject to strict security measures. It was later alleged that the source of the rumours was Joel himself, and that the whole affair was either a poorly judged practical joke or an attempt to obtain better odds. At Epsom on 31 May, Sunstar, despite widespread rumours about his fitness, started the 13/8 favourite in a field of twenty-six runners. The race took place on a fine day and attracted the customary enormous crowd including the King and Queen. The field was considered weaker than usual, with several of the year's best colts missing the race, including the City and Suburban Handicap winner Mushroom, who had never been entered. The start was unsatisfactory, as Stedfast refused to line up with the other runners and was left several lengths behind when the race began. George Stern settled Sunstar in fourth or fifth place behind Bannockburn, Phryxus and Eton Boy, until the turn into the straight when he sent the favourite through a gap on the inside to take the lead. Sunstar went clear of the field, but Stedfast, who had made up a great deal of ground, emerged as his challenger and got to within a length of the leader a furlong from the finish. At this point Stern felt Sunstar falter as his suspect foreleg gave way, but despite his injury, the colt pulled ahead again and won by two lengths from Stedfast, with Royal Tudor four lengths back in third. His winning time of 3:36.8 equaled the second fastest time in the race's history. Sunstar's lameness returned as soon as he pulled up after the race and he was barely able to walk to the winner's circle. It was a first Derby win for Stern, after finishing second on Jardy in 1905 and Louviers in 1909. In addition to the winner's prize of £6,450, Joel reportedly took over £30,000 in winning bets. Initial reports stated that Sunstar was to be immediately taken out of training and retired. In reality, the colt showed some signs of recovery and was being prepared for the St Leger at Doncaster in September when he broke down again in training in August and was then retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, Tony Morris and John Randall rated Sunstar a \\"superior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas and an average winner of the Derby. The premature ending of his career meant that he was never tested against Prince Palatine, who was probably the best horse of his generation. Stud record Sunstar was retired to stud duty at Jack Joel's Childwick Bury Stud near St. Albans, Hertfordshire, at an initial fee of 300 guineas. He proved to be both a very influential sire and broodmare sire. He was also exceptionally fertile and covered such large books of mares that Joel was criticised by rival breeders. Among his progeny were: * Craig an Eran (born 1918), won 2000 Guineas Stakes * Sunny Jane (born 1914), won Epsom Oaks * Zodiac (born 1921), won Irish Derby Stakes * Buchan (born 1916), leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland (1927) * Galloper Light (born 1916), won Grand Prix de Paris; sire of Epsom Oaks winners, Beam and Light Brocade * Sunbonnet (born 1914), won Kentucky Oaks, Alabama Stakes, American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly * Alan Breck (born 1918), leading sire in Argentina * North Star (born 1914), won Middle Park Stakes, sire of Kentucky Derby winner Bubbling Over * Roselyon (born 1916), sire of King's Plate winners Aymond and Willie the Kid Sunstar was the leading broodmare sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1930. He was notably the damsire of: * Sunstep (born 1916), became a foundation mare for Claiborne Farm * Ellangowan (born 1920), won 2000 Guineas Stakes * Kopi (born 1926), won Irish Derby Stakes Sunstar died on 21 August 1926, and was buried alongside his sire Sundridge in the equine cemetery at Childwick Bury Stud where his monument still stands Pedigree References 1908 racehorse births 1926 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Joel family Thoroughbred family 5-i Chefs-de-Race Epsom Derby winners 2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Sunstar (racehorse)"},{"id":"21096961","text":"John Ramsey Miller (born October 3, 1949) is an American author living in North Carolina.

The generally accepted view is that being overweight causes similar health problems to obesity, but to a lesser degree. Cardiological HeartAttack (Myocardial infarction) =Ischemic heart disease= Obesity is associated with cardiovascular diseases including angina and myocardial infarction. A 2002 report concluded that 21% of ischemic heart disease is due to obesity while a 2008 European consensus puts the number at 35%. as PDF =Congestive heart failure= Having obesity is associated to about 11% of heart failure cases in men and 14% in women. =High blood pressure= More than 85% of those with hypertension have a BMI greater than 25. The risk of hypertension is 5 times higher in the obese as compared to those of normal weight. A definitive link between obesity and hypertension has been found using animal and clinical studies, which have suggested that there are multiple potential mechanisms for obesity-induced hypertension. These mechanisms include the activation of the sympathetic nervous system as well as the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. The association between hypertension and obesity has been also well described in children. =Abnormal cholesterol levels= Obesity is associated with increased LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and lowered HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). =Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism= Obesity increases one's risk of venous thromboembolism by 2.3 fold. Dermatological Obesity is associated with the incidence of stretch marks, acanthosis nigricans, lymphedema, cellulitis, hirsutism, and intertrigo. Endocrine Gynecomastia in an obese male. =Diabetes mellitus= One of the strongest links between obesity and disease is that with type 2 diabetes. These two conditions are so strongly linked that researchers in the 1970s started calling it \\"diabesity\\". Excess weight is behind 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women. =Gynecomastia= Obesity, according to a 2009 review, can be associated with elevated peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens in some individuals. Gastrointestinal =Gastroesophageal reflux disease= Several studies have shown that the frequency and severity of GERD symptoms are higher in those who are obese. =Cholelithiasis (gallstones)= According to NIH, obesity causes the amount of cholesterol in bile to rise, in turn the formation of stone can occur Reproductive system (or genital system) =Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)= Due to its association with insulin resistance, the risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) increases with adiposity. In the US approximately 60% of patients with PCOS have a BMI greater than 30. It remains uncertain whether PCOS contributes to obesity, or the reverse. =Infertility= Obesity leads to infertility in both men and women. This is primarily due to excess estrogen interfering with normal ovulation in women and altering spermatogenesis in men. It is believed to cause 6% of primary infertility. A review in 2013 came to the result that obesity increases the risk of oligospermia and azoospermia in men, with an of odds ratio 1.3. Being morbidly obese increases the odds ratio to 2.0. =Complications of pregnancy= Obesity is related to many complications in pregnancy including: haemorrhage, infection, increased hospital stays for the mother, and increased NICU requirements for the infant. Obese women have more than twice the rate of C-sections compared to women of normal weight. Obese women also have increased risk of preterm births and low birth weight infants. =Birth defects= Those who are obese during pregnancy have a greater risk of have a child with a number of congenital malformations including: neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida, cardiovascular anomalies, including septal anomalies, cleft lip and palate, anorectal malformation, limb reduction anomalies, and hydrocephaly. =Intrauterine fetal death= Maternal obesity is associated with an increased risk of intrauterine fetal death. Neurological MCA Territory Infarct (stroke) =Stroke= Ischemic stroke is increased in both men and women who are obese. =Meralgia paresthetica= Meralgia paresthetica is a neuropathic pain or numbness of the thighs, sometimes associated with obesity. =Migraines= Migraine and obesity are comorbid. The risk of migraine rises 50% by BMI of 30 kg/m2 and 100% by BMI of 35 kg/m2. The causal connection remains unclear. =Carpal tunnel syndrome= The risk of carpal tunnel syndrome rises 7.4% for each 1 kg/m2 increase of body mass index. =Dementia= Those who are obese have a rate of dementia 1.4 times greater than those of normal weight. =Idiopathic intracranial hypertension= Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or unexplained high pressure in the cranium, is a rare condition that can cause visual impairment, frequent severe headache, and tinnitus. It is most commonly seen in obese women. =Multiple sclerosis= Women that are obese at age 18 have a greater than twofold increased risk of MS. Cancer (or oncological) Hepatocellular carcinoma 1 Many cancers occur at increased frequency in those who are overweight or obese. A study from the United Kingdom found that approximately 5% of cancer is due to excess weight. These cancers include: :::::::::::*breast, ovarian :::::::::::*esophageal, colorectal :::::::::::*liver, pancreatic :::::::::::*gallbladder, stomach :::::::::::*endometrial, cervical :::::::::::*prostate, kidney :::::::::::*non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma A high body mass index (BMI) is associated with a higher risk of developing ten common cancers including 41% of uterine cancers and at least 10% of gallbladder, kidney, liver and colon cancers in the UK. For those undergoing surgery for cancer, obesity is also associated with an increased risk of major postoperative complications compared with those of normal weight. Psychiatric Risk of suicide decreases with increased body mass index in the United States. =Depression= Obesity has been associated with depression. The relationship is strongest in those who are more severely obese, those who are younger, and in women. Suicide rate however decreases with increased BMI. =Social stigmatization= A 2011 systematic review indicated that obese people draw negative reactions, furthermore people are less willing to help the affected individual in any situation. Respiratory system =Obstructive sleep apnea= Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea. =Obesity hypoventilation syndrome= CPAP machine commonly used in OHS Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as the combination of obesity, hypoxia during sleep, and hypercapnia during the day, resulting from hypoventilation. =Chronic lung disease= Obesity is associated with a number of chronic lung diseases, including asthma and COPD. It is believed that a systemic pro- inflammatory state induced by some causes of obesity may contribute to airway inflammation, leading to asthma. =Complications during general anaesthesia= Obesity significantly reduces and stiffens the functional lung volume, requiring specific strategies for respiratory management under general anesthesia. =Obesity and asthma= The low grade systemic inflammation of obesity has been show to worsen lung function in asthma and increase the risk of developing an asthma exacerbation. Rheumatological and orthopedic Gout =Gout= Compared to men with a BMI of 21–23, men with a BMI of 30–35 have 2.3 times more gout, and men with a BMI of greater than 35 have 3.0 times more gout. Weight loss decreases these risks. =Poor mobility= There is a strong association between obesity and musculoskeletal pain and disability. =Osteoarthritis= Increased rates of arthritis are seen in both weight- bearing and non-weight-bearing joints. Weight loss and exercise act to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis. =Low back pain= Obese individuals are twice to four times more likely to have lower back pain than their normal weight peers. Traumatic injury In women, class II obesity (i.e. BMI = 35) is a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures in general, as well as for upper arm fractures. Urological and nephrological Urinary system =Urinary incontinence= Urge, stress, and mixed incontinence all occur at higher rates in the obese. The rates are about double that found in the normal weight population. Urinary incontinence improves with weight lost. =Chronic kidney disease= Obesity increases one's risk of chronic kidney disease by three to four times. =Hypogonadism= In men, obesity and metabolic syndrome both increase estrogen and adipokine production. This reduces gonadotropin- releasing hormone, in turn reducing both luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone. The result is reduction of the testis' production of testosterone and a further increase in adipokine levels. This then feeds back to cause further weight gain. =Erectile dysfunction= Obese men can experience erectile dysfunction, (as well as, in association with diabetes), however weight loss causes an improvement in their sexual functioning.

Its HQ is in central Baghdad. The bank was established in 1941 and in the 1960s in a wave of Ba'ath nationalisation became a state bank. In 1988, the Rafidain's non-performing assets were carved out into the Rasheed Bank. Before the First Gulf War, Rafidain Bank \\"was the Arab world’s largest commercial bank with total assets of USD 47 billion.\\". The Bank was very badly damaged by the first Gulf War and the economic sanctions against Iraq. These sanctions were behind the closure of Rafidain's London Branch in 1990. During the second Gulf War, the bank was again badly hit. It is estimated that around a third of Rafidain's branches were destroyed during the second Gulf War and that the bank lost around $300m USD through looting. Today, Rafidain Bank has around 45% of banking assets in Iraq. In 2007, Bayan Jabor, the Iraqi Minister of Finance, signed a contract with British companies B-Plan Information Systems and Misys to rebuild the bank, in a turnkey contract to supply a core banking system, hardware, communications systems, and training to Rafidain Staff, across all branches inside and outside Iraq. This project will cover basic retail banking and trade finance but advanced banking functions such as ATM networks, Card Management and internet banking will be considered by the Ministry of Finance in later stages. This project will represent the first commercial bank in Iraq to work on a modern electronic banking system and should be completed by the end of 2009.

It was an angular low-wing monoplane, which could be powered by a variety of small engines. Design and development Siebel Si.202 cockpit photo from L'Aerophile July 1939 In January 1937 Major Werner Junck, chief of the LC II, the technical wing of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium responsible for the development of new aircraft, informed various minor aircraft manufacturers such as Flugzeugwerke Halle, which later in the year would become Siebel, Bücker, Fieseler, Gothaer Waggonfabrik and Klemm that they would not get any contracts for the development of military aircraft. He therefore advised them to concentrate in the development of a Volksflugzeug or a small twin-engined plane. As a result, Flugzeugwerke Halle developed the Si 202, while the other companies produced the Kl 105, the Fi 253, the Bü 180 and the Go 150. The Hummel was a small single-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane with side-by-side seating for two, designed to accept a variety of low powered engines of either radial or in-line arrangement. It was aimed at the sports and club market. Most variants had sharply clipped wing and tail surfaces, giving the Hummel an attractively angular appearance compared with its contemporaries. Structurally, the Hummel was a wooden aircraft. The wing were built around a wooden monospar with plywood covered leading edges and ailerons, with fabric covering elsewhere. The fuselage was a plywood covered wooden structure, as were the fixed tail surfaces, rudder and elevators being fabric covered. The horizontal tail surfaces were set noticeably aft of the rudder, rather like the more recent Piper PA-28. The enclosed cabin had dual controls, a single central control column being shared via horizontal extensions. There was a generous baggage space behind the seats. The fixed undercarriage had main wheels on split axles, with low pressure tyres and brakes. There was a sprung tailskid. The first prototype D-ESFH had a nine-cylinder radial Salmson 9Ad motor of 36 kW (45 hp), and began flight testing in May 1938. For a light aircraft, there was a surprising number of prototypes (at least seven), mostly exploring different engine installations. The engines of the three main variants are given below; the third prototype used a 46 kW (62 hp) Walter Mikron II four-cylinder in- line air-cooled motor. On 2 February 1939 a Si.202b set a new altitude record for light aircraft carrying two people with an engine of 2 litre capacity, at . On 6 February the same pilot set another record with just the pilot aboard, reaching . At least 17 Hummels, including the prototypes, appeared on the German civil list before the start of World War II and 8 more on the Hungarian list.

Through this collaboration, federal agencies can leverage resources to invest in priorities that fall between agency missions or are too large for any single agency to support. In its first 20 years, NOPP invested more than $468 million to support over 200 research and education projects with over 600 partners. A comparable amount of in-kind support has been committed by the research and education community. Purpose and Function NOPP was established in 1997 through the National Oceanographic Partnership Act (PL 104-201, 10 USC 7901-7903) to improve the nation’s knowledge of the ocean, with the goals of promoting national security, advancing economic development, protecting quality of life, and strengthening science education and communication. NOPP policies are determined by the NOPP Committee, which is composed of Federal agency representatives committed to advancing ocean science and technology initiatives through partnerships. The NOPP Committee establishes NOPP implementation procedures and selects NOPP projects through agency-issued calls for proposals. The Biodiversity Ad-Hoc Working Group and Federal Renewable Ocean Energy Working Group (FROEWG) are subcommittees of the NOPP Committee focused on facilitating interagency communications and collaborations around their respective focus areas. NOPP also supports the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG-FI) and the Ocean Research Advisory Panel (ORAP). IWG-FI is a subgroup of the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on Ocean and Science Technology. IWG-FI reviews and evaluates Federal infrastructure regarding facilities (e.g., ships) necessary for conducting ocean research and observation, and is involved in evaluating future needs and planning future investments in ocean- related facilities. ORAP provides independent recommendations to federal agencies that relate to the ocean and is composed of representatives from the National Academies, state governments, academic institutions, and ocean industries. Accomplishments NOPP has significantly impacted the realm of ocean science and technology and results from NOPP research projects have informed both federal ocean policy and federal and regional natural resource management. Through its outreach efforts and support of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, NOPP has inspired careers in STEM fields. NOPP contributions have increased the volume and efficiency of ocean research and stimulated the development of applied ocean technology. Perhaps the most important role of NOPP has been to increase multi-disciplinary, cross-sector research partnering and strengthen communication about the most pressing research needs within the national ocean science community. In general, NOPP projects fall within the categories of ocean observation systems, marine infrastructure and technology, earth systems modelling, coastal and marine resources, ocean education, and marine life. Projects that exemplify the highest level of success in achieving NOPP goals and working in diverse sector partnerships are awarded the yearly NOPP Excellence in Partnering Award. Some examples of NOPP-funded projects include: * U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS): Over 50 NOPP projects have supported IOOS, including developing independent observation systems in every marine region of the U.S. and integrating and maintaining the necessary data infrastructure. * Argo: The Argo program created a global array of over 3,000 autonomous profiling CTD floats that deliver real-time climate and oceanography data. * Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON): MBON has used novel eDNA techniques and ongoing ocean observation systems to evaluate habitat and trophic level diversity and changing ecological states, with the goal of better understanding the relationships between human dimensions, climate and environmental variability, and ecosystem structure. * JASON: The JASON project began as a way to connect students and teachers to researchers participating in the 1998 East Pacific Rise expedition. In continuation, the project provides an educational platform to help educators gain access to marine researchers and interactive marine science-related curriculum. * National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB): NOSB is an academic competition that engages high school students in ocean science, prepares them for STEM careers, and helps them become environmental stewards. * Marine Arctic Ecosystem Study (MARES): MARES aims to better understand the relationship between the physical, biological, chemical, and human systems of the Beaufort Sea, with the goal of advancing prediction capabilities relating to marine life, human use, sea ice, and atmospheric and oceanic processes. * Deep Sea Exploration to Advance Research on Coral/Canyon/Cold Seep Habitats (Deep SEARCH): Deep SEARCH is exploring and characterizing the biological communities of deep-sea habitats to improve prediction capabilities of seafloor communities in the Atlantic that are potentially sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. * Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network (ADEON): ADEOM combines passive and active acoustic information with data from space-based remote sensing, hydrographic sensors, and mobile platforms to better understand how human, biotic, and abiotic components influence the soundscape and ecosystem of the Outer Continental Shelf. * Bridge: The Bridge is a web-based research center that connects marine educators, academia, private sector, and government by allowing researchers to disseminate accurate and useful marine science information directly to educators.

The program shows Horner with his digging team as they travel to Hell Creek Formation in search for dinosaur fossils, while also following Horner as he presents his view of the theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex as a scavenger rather than a predator, as it is often portrayed in popular culture. Plot The program shows Horner and his digging team as they travel to the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, United States, and dig up dinosaurs. The program also follows Horner as he presents arguments for his case of Tyrannosaurus as a scavenger. Horner argues that there is not the slightest evidence that Tyrannosaurus hunted its own prey. Instead, Horner believe the evidence should be clear that Tyrannosaurus was a scavenger, lamenting that \\"no one likes that idea\\". Some of Horner's arguments for a scavenger-only Tyrannosaurus are: *Forelimbs: Tyrannosaurus short forelimbs seems like they could not hold on to struggling prey. Horner argue that predators have well developed forelimbs with claws to hold prey down while the jaws do the killing, while Tyrannosaurus could not use its forelimbs for much more than to \\"scratch its belly\\". Horner believes the upper arm of Tyrannosaurus would have been embedded in muscle, and not externally visible in life. And if Tyrannosaurus stumbled and fell while trying to run, the small forelimbs would not be enough to brake the fall, and it would get fatal injures. *Speed: Horner argues that Tyrannosaurus must have been too slow to chase down prey, and also points out that some specimens of Tyrannosaurus have longer thighbones than shinbones.Locke R, 2001, \\"Killing a Legend: New Evidence Paints T. Rex as a Nasty Scavenger, Not a Vicious Hunter\\", dsc.discovery.com, read July 11, 2012. According to Horner, this is not the case in fast-running animals like Saurornitholestes, which have longer shinbones than thighbones. Horner describes Tyrannosaurus as \\"either a really slow runner, or just a walker.\\" *Brain and senses: Horner suggest that Tyrannosaurus had a poorly developed sense of sight, and would not be a good predator. On the other hand, the huge olfactory bulb indicates \\"a tremendous sense of smell\\", used to find carcasses. *Jaws and teeth: Tyrannosaurus had powerful jaws and robust teeth. Horner argue that Tyrannosaurus used them for crushing bones, as modern scavengers like hyenas do to feed on marrow when the flesh of carcass has rotted away. Predators teeth are normally thin and sharp for slicing flesh. Tyrannosaurus becomes depicted as Horner imagines it: a big, slow-moving animal, traveling across the landscape in search of a carcass. Horner thinks Tyrannosaurus would have a repulsive look: A dark body, a red head, and it would give off a terrible smell. This would help it frighten away other meateaters, like dromaeosaurs, from carcasses. His description of T. rex is \\"big, nasty, and stinky.\\" About the program *When Horner examines the anatomy of Tyrannosaurus in the program, he mostly use the specimen MOR 555 (\\"Wankel Rex\\") as reference. This specimen was found by Kathy Wankel in 1988, and was the first specimen of the genus with a well-preserved forelimb. *The program features Horner and his team as they dig up 5 new Tyrannosaurus specimens. *The computer animation in the program was made by Meteor Studios. Some of the animations are taken from one of Discovery Channel's other programs about dinosaurs, When Dinosaurs Roamed America. Criticism Since Valley of the T. rex was shown on television, it has been met by criticism. Many of the arguments Horner use to support his case have been examined by other paleontologists, who do not agree that they conclusively show Tyrannosaurus was an obligate scavenger.Holtz T.R.jr. \\"A critical re-appraisal of the obligate scavenging hypothesis for Tyrannosaurus rex and other tyrant dinosaurs\\", in Tanke D.H., Carpenter K & Skrepnick M.W. Mesozoic Vertebrate Life (Indiana University Press, 2001), p. 370-396. As for Tyrannosaurus short forelimbs, it has been pointed out that predators like wolves and hyenas do not use their frontlegs to take down prey. Moreover, hyenas, like Tyrannosaurus, have jaws and teeth to crush bone, yet they use it to hunt their own prey. In the program, Horner measure the leg bones of MOR 1128, or \\"G-rex\\", one of the skeletons which were shown in the program as it was dug up. The narrator says that \\"G-rex\\" was found in a rock layer 90 meters below where \\"Wankelrex\\" was found, and Horner says \\"G-rex\\" are thought to be 3 million years older than other known specimens (like \\"Wankelrex\\"). Horner also says that \\"G-rex\\" have thighbone and shinbone of equal length, while \\"Wankelrex\\", have longer thighbone than shinbone. Horner argue it is an indication that Tyrannosaurus over time lost the ability to run and evolved to more specialization as a walking scavenger. It has been argued by Garner, however, that the shinbone of \\"Wankelrex\\" are restored from broken fragments,http://www.cmnh.org/dinoarch/2001Sep/msg00522.html. making it inaproppriate as reference in comparative morphology. Also, according to other reports, \\"G-rex\\" also have longer thighbone (1.26 meters)Larson P.L., \\"Variation and Sexual Dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex\\", in Larson P.L. & Carpenter K, Tyrannosaurus rex, the Tyrant King (Indiana University Press, 2008), p. 103-130. than shinbone (1.12 meters).Horner J.R. & Padian K. (2004), \\"Age and growth dynamics of Tyrannosaurus rex\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 271(1551): p. 1875-1880. Holtz also points out that longer thighbones than shinbones is a condition also found in horses, which are fast running animals. A shorter shinbone might be compensated by a relatively long metatarsus, which is seen both in horses and tyrannosaurids. Other scientists have argued that Tyrannosaurus could have had a well-developed sense of sight with binocular vision, typical of a predator,Stevens K.A. (2006), \\"Binocular vision in theropod dinosaurs\\" , Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26(2): p. 321-330. and a well-developed sense of smell in Tyrannosaurus could have been used for hunting, rather than just finding carcasses. Evidences for a predatory lifestyle in Tyrannosaurus includes discoveries of skeletons from herbivorous dinosaurs like Edmontosaurus and Triceratops, with evidence of healed bitemarks on them, indicating they survived attacks from big predators, possibly Tyrannosaurus.

It opened its line, which was expensive to construct, in 1909 but the local traffic never developed. It closed to passenger traffic in 1951, and completely in 1964. Background The Newport Railway opened its short line in 1879, running from the Fife end of the newly opened Tay Rail Bridge. The short line immediately opened up residential travel from Newport-on-Tay to Dundee, providing a journey time of ten minutes by train, rather than the former unreliable ferry crossing. The fall of the Tay Bridge later that year, in the Tay Bridge Disaster, naturally caused a disruption to the development of the passenger business, but when the second Tay Bridge opened in 1887 the trade was quick to resume. Dundee is hemmed in between the Firth of Tay and the hilly country to the north, and expansion to the south, in Fife, encouraged residential development. Incorporation of the Newburgh and North Fife Railway Observing the commercial success of the Newport Railway, local promoters developed a scheme for another railway, this time running south-west from the Fife end of the Tay Bridge. This too was intended to develop housing and residential travel across the Tay, as well as linking up towards Perth at the Newburgh end, potentially tapping traffic at that end of the line. There was an enthusiastic meeting of potential promoters in the Royal Hotel, Cupar on 3 November 1896.Dundee Courier: 4 November 1896 The Newburgh and North Fife Railway System map of the Newburgh and North Fife RailwayThe Newburgh and North Fife Railway obtained its Act of Parliament on 6 August 1897. It was to be just over thirteen miles in length, between Glenburnie Junction at Newburgh (between Ladybank and Perth) and a triangular junction at St Fort, between the Tay Bridge and Leuchars, enabling direct running to the bridge or towards St Andrews. The authorised capital was £120,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 However the months rolled past and nothing was done, the subscription list not having been fulfilled, and the powers for construction had to be revived by the North British Railway in its general powers Acts in 1900, 1902, 1904 and 1906. At last on 11 June 1906 contracts had been let.Dundee Courier: 11 June 1906 Soon the first sod was cut, in June 1906Dundee Courier, 14 January 1909 The line involved prodigious engineering works and took five years to construct. The line was inspected by Major Pringle of the Board of Trade on 12 January 1909. Opening The line opened for \\"general\\" traffic (that is, goods) on 22 January 1909John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1975, and on 25 January 1909 the line opened fully.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The actual cost at completion seems to have exceeded the estimate by a considerable margin: > The Newburgh and North Fife Railway, which is to be opened on Monday [25 > January 1909] for public service, is about 13¼ miles in length and was built > at a cost of about £240,000.

There were intermediate stations at Kilmany, Luthrie and Lindores; Kilmany and Luthrie had passing loops and the three stations had ample 450 feet long platforms. There were also intermediate goods sidings at Rathillet, just west of Kilmany, and at Ayton Smithy, between Lindores and Luthrie. Coming late to the development of transport facilities, there were several important roads to be crossed on the skew, and there were a prodigious number of long-span bridges on the line; earthworks too were of a heavier character than usual. Dissension \\"The Scottish Rambler\\" Railtour at Lindores Station in 1962 hauled by a Gresley J39 No. 64786 The initial passenger train service evidently made poor connections at each end; \\"A disappointed Fifer\\" wrote to the local newspaper: > The earliest train in the morning does not arrive in Dundee until 9.34. > Passengers by the succeeding train have only fifty minutes to wait at St > Fort.

The Directors of the Newburgh and North Fife Railway sued the North British Railway for inadequately generating income. In addition there was a dispute about the extent of the guarantee to make up the 4% dividend: the issue was the capital sum on which that 4% was to be based. The NBR was accused by the owning company (the Newburgh and North Fife Railway) of failing to make enough effort to generate traffic for the line, and indeed of diverting traffic on to their own wholly owned parallel lines. At a tribunal the NBR presented figures showing that they were losing money heavily in working the line, which was being done for 50% of gross receipts. In a typical year the receipts for the line were £2,799 of which the NBR received £1,399; the cost to them of working the line was £4,122, incurring a loss of £2,723. Local traffic generated only £20 to £30 annually.William Scott Bruce, The Railways of Fife, The Melven Press, Perth, 1980, , pages 143 to 148 At summary hearing the North British lost the case brought by the Newburgh and North Fife company requiring NBR to make up the 4% dividend; the N&NFR; alleged that the NBR had not made adequate efforts to promote the line.Dundee Courier: 23 February 1911Dundee Evening Telegraph: 28 November 1911 The court found against the NBR.Dundee Courier: 29 January 1912 However, on appeal the capital on which the 4% was due was reduced from the claimed £240,000 to £137,965.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer: 31 January 1914 Track bed of the closed Newburgh and North Fife Railway. The NBR attempted to make something of the line by running fast trains between Dundee and Perth in competition with the Caledonian Railway service. However the NBR trains had a significant mileage penalty, crossing the Tay Bridge before turning west, and finally being dependent on the rival company's line from Hilton Junction into Perth, and the trains were not outstandingly successful.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 26 and 27 Moreover, the cut-throat competition of earlier decades was over; in those days the NBR would have used every stratagem to route goods traffic over the line it was working at the expense of its rival; but now fair play was the philosophy, and only goods wagons that achieved a shorter transit travelled over the line. There was little originating on the line itself. The promoters compared the towns they were going to serve with Newport-on-Tay; but Newport had an established traffic of daily commuters with Dundee by ferry, and was a commercially oriented town; the villages on the Newburgh line were relatively undeveloped agricultural settlements. Later events The south curve at St Fort was closed after only three years. During World War I there was a serious shortage of manpower and the line closed temporarily; the service resumed on 22 July 1916 traffic resumed after temporary closure due to staff shortage. In 1922 there were four passenger trains daily over the line, running between Dundee and Perth. The journey time from Kilmany to Dundee was about twenty minutes.Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 Grouping, and nationalisation The Newburgh and North Fife Railway remained independent, although not operating the railway itself until the grouping of the railways of Great Britain following the Railways Act 1921, when the N&NFR; and the North British Railway were transferred into the new London and North Eastern Railway. In 1948 the LNER was nationalised and became part of British Railway. In 1933 an application by a bus operator to run a service paralleling the line was refused by the Road Traffic Commissioners, on the ground that the line's precarious finances meant that it would close if the bus service operated. The last regular passenger train ran on 10 February 1951. However, for eight weeks in early 1955 the Tay viaduct at Perth was closed at night for repairs, and night goods trains were diverted over the line during the work. The line was closed to all traffic from Glenburnie Junction to Lindores on 4 April 1960, and throughout on 5 October 1964.

It was established in 1992, making it the oldest American card company still in business exclusively producing non-sports trading card sets. Many trading card companies like Topps are corporate subsidiaries that primarily produce sports related issues. However, Monsterwax is a small privately owned company focusing primarily on non-licensed entertainment cards. They usually release only one to three series a year. Monsterwax generally limits their print runs to less than 500 boxes (a fraction of the industry standard) and numbers each box and checklist. Monsterwax promo card to War Of The Worlds History Monsterwax is best known for making retro style art cards similar to the ones produced during the golden age of non- sports cards (the 1940s – 1960s). They typically feature nostalgic wrappers, dramatic stories, and original artwork. The topics can be esoteric. Their first series, Tune In For Terror, profiled the popular horror programs from radio’s golden era. The Art of H.G. Wells (from 2005) connected The Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and The War of the Worlds together into one unbroken narrative. Don’t Let It Happen Here (2003) was a homage to Horrors Of War, Fight The Red Menace, and other jingoistic hyper-patriotic card sets from the past. Like its classic predecessors, Don’t Let It Happen Here garnered a certain amount of publicity for showing graphic acts of violence while presenting informative news events from around the world. Alt URL Most Monsterwax products are designed by Kurt Kuersteiner (writer and company founder) and painted by a featured artist (often Ricardo Garijo of Commando Comics fame, as well as his son, Ricardo Jr., after his father's death in 2009). Monsterwax is often critical of aggressive industry practices. Their \\"Monsterwax Manifesto\\" criticizes the typical chase card ratios that force customers to buy several cases to finish a master set. They claim that the practice alienates collectors and hurts the hobby. Although Monsterwax produces chase cards, they usually include a complete set of them in every box, which is not the industry norm. They also speak out against dumping of old products and often mock the “speculative attitude” of sports card collectors. Many of their advertisements are illustrated parodies of 1960s public service or comic book ads and commonly mock the sports card hobby. Monsterwax occasionally uses the trademark Mystery Playhouse on their test products, which was the original name of the haunted house that they sponsor every Halloween (since 1999) near their headquarters in Tallahassee, Florida. The company financed event has since grown into a full-scale haunted attraction and was renamed the Terror of Tallahassee in 2003. The haunt was also used as the backdrop to the 2004 Night Slasher card set, which was a spoof of the TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.

He first came to prominence during the 1940s and 1950s in several operas by composer Benjamin Britten, often performing at Covent Garden and the Aldeburgh and Glyndebourne festivals. He later began a television acting career during the 1970s appearing mostly in small roles in TV dramas. He branched out into films during the 1980s, notably appearing in Clint Eastwood's 1990 film White Hunter, Black Heart. He is particularly remembered for his portrayal of J. R. Hartley in the 1983 Yellow Pages advert Fly Fishing by J. R. Hartley, in 2015 voted fifth most popular British TV advertisement. Biography =Early life and education= Born Norman Thompson in Chelsea in 1906, Lumsden was the son of a butler. He originally worked as a commercial artist, designing book jackets for the publishers Hodder & Stoughton, including those for Leslie Charteris's The Saint series.Obituary of Norman Lumsden, 3 December 2001 in The Independent After suffering a bout of emphysema he took up singing on the advice of his doctor to strengthen his lungs. He was taught by the basses Robert Radford and Norman Allin.Obituary of Norman Lumsden, 2 December 2001 in The Daily Telegraph Early career Lumsden's singing career began before World War II with singing popular classics on the wireless and performing in oratorio around Britain. His first radio broadcast was for the BBC in the 1930s, during which he sang Negro spirituals and Czechoslovak songs by Dvořák. It was at this time that he changed his surname to Lumsden. In 1945 he gave an acclaimed debut recital at London's Wigmore Hall, performing arias from Handel and Verdi, and taking small roles at Sadler's Wells. Lumsden's singing talents were recognised by Benjamin Britten, who described him as, \\"that rare British product, a true bass\\". Lumsden was an original member of the ensemble of the English Opera Group, founded by Britten and Peter Pears in 1947. A bass, Lumsden had a distinguished career as an opera singer, performing several times at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, and also at the Aldeburgh and Glyndebourne festivals. He created roles in the first performances of several of Britten's works, including Quince the carpenter in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960), a role Britten wrote particularly with Lumsden's voice in mind, Superintendent Budd in Albert Herring (1947), and Black Bob in the children's opera The Little Sweep (1949). He also appeared in Britten's Billy Budd, and played Collatinus in The Rape of Lucretia, and Peachum in Britten's adaptation of The Beggar's Opera. Lumsden also took part in Britten's first 13 Aldeburgh Festivals between 1948 – 1960. Family In 1952 Lumsden married Irene Palmer with whom he had one son. His wife was a soprano and during the 1950s they appeared in cabaret together, performing extracts from musicals at seaside resorts and London hotels. In 1967 Lumsden returned to the English Opera Group to create the role of Luka in William Walton's opera The Bear at the 1967 Aldeburgh Festival. Later career Lumsden embarked on a second career as a dramatic actor during the 1970s. After appearing in a commercial for cracker biscuits in 1970, Lumsden began to appear in small roles in TV dramas, including the BBC's Play for Today, Edna, the Inebriate Woman (1971), The Sweeney (1978), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982), Minder (1984) in which he played the role of a vicar in the episode Senior Citizen Caine, Agatha Christie's Poirot (1989), One Foot in the Grave (1990), Jeeves and Wooster (1990), and The Detectives (1993).Norman Lumsden profile at IMDb at the Internet Movie Database His film appearances were sparse but included roles in Runners (1983), A Handful of Dust (1988), and White Hunter Black Heart (1990) with Clint Eastwood.Norman Lumsden profile at Lovefilm.com He found fame late in life, through the Yellow Pages 1983 TV advert in which Lumsden played J. R. Hartley, a fictional character in search of an out of print book called Fly Fishing by 'J.R. Hartley'. The advertisement is one of the most popular ever made in Britain, – 13th position and remained a part of popular culture long after it ceased to be shown. Although he was most famous for playing Fly Fishing author J.R. Hartley, Lumsden didn't actually take up fishing until he was 85 years old. The advert has left such a lasting impression, that an actual book titled Fly Fishing was published under the J.R. Hartley pseudonym with Lumsden being hired to promote it as J.R. Hartley. It was reworked and remade for a new generation in 2011, 28 years later, this time featuring a middle-aged DJ looking for his only hit in old record shops, not finding any luck until his daughter gives him the Yellow Pages (now on an iPhone 4G), with him finding the record. Death In 2001 Lumsden contracted shingles and died from subsequent infection at the age of 95. After his death the \\"Fly Fishing by JR Hartley\\" advert was rebroadcast as a tribute.

Early life He was born in Staten Island in 1888. Upon graduating from Amherst College in 1910 he went to New York City intending to apply for work at Standard Oil. By mistake, Francis went to the wrong office and soon found himself working for the Corn Products Refining Company, a small food manufacturing firm. This inauspicious beginning led to a lifelong interest in the food industry. By the time Francis retired from the General Foods Corporation in 1954 he had risen to become Chairman of the Board of Directors. After absorbing an initial $17 million loss in the frozen foods sector, Francis was able to turn a profit for General Foods in this very important market. Career After working for Corn Products and Ralston Purina, Francis joined the Postum Company (later General Foods) in 1924. He became executive vice president in 1931, president in 1935,and then chairman of the board in 1943.Who's Who in America 1952-53 page 843. In addition to his work in the food industry, Francis also served as a government consultant. By 1933 he was recognized as an expert on food production and distribution. When the National Recovery Administration, one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal agencies, was created to establish codes to regulate business operations, Francis was hired as a consultant to help draft codes for the food industry. The successful conclusion of this task led to further demands for his services. Between 1940 and 1943 he assisted in defense mobilization; from 1943 to 1945 he led a committee that studied the food services at several naval bases in the United States; he studied manpower training and utilization in the U.S. Department of Defense from 1951-52; and he evaluated the Mutual Security Program in 1953. In 1949, Francis was appointed by Secretary of Interior Julius A.

After his retirement in 1954 he was able to devote most of his time to government service. He became a special consultant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower with the responsibility of disposing of the vast agricultural surpluses which the federal government had accumulated. At the same time he served as chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report, and was the American representative on the European Productivity Agency. At the end of the Eisenhower administration Francis left government services and returned to private business. His last major activity was with the Economic Development Council of New York City.

Description Shell of Argopecten irradians from Bermuda Islands at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano Bay scallop fishery This species of scallop used to support a large wild fishery on the East Coast of the United States, but since the 1950s it has decreased greatly. This is apparently the result of several negative influences, one of which is a reduction in sea grasses (to which bay scallop spat attach) due to increased coastal development and concomitant nutrient runoff. Another possible factor is reduction of sharks from overfishing, a variety of which used to feed on ray species that are a main predator of bay scallops. By contrast, the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) is at historically high levels of abundance, after recovery from overfishing.

Plot Felix Gaeta and Tom Zarek move to consolidate their insurrection in the fleet, while Cpt. Kara Thrace and Lee Adama organize resistance on board the Galactica and try to retake control of the ship. Zarek brings in Romo Lampkin to serve as Admiral Adama's defense counsel, against both Lampkin's and Adama's will. After a brief trial, Zarek, acting as judge, condemns Adama to death by firing squad. Zarek travels to Colonial One to attempt to solidify his position with the support of the Quorum of Twelve (absent Lee Adama). When they reject his coup and ask him to leave, he has two marines execute the entire group. Meanwhile, Kara and Lee rescue the high- profile prisoners taken in \\"The Oath\\" (Samuel Anders, Colonel Tigh, Sharon Agathon, as well as Helo, Hera and Caprica-Six), and with the help of Aaron Kelly rescue Admiral Adama from execution. Laura Roslin and her allies on the Cylon basestar, now under threat of attack from Gaeta and the Galactica, position the ship among the fleet to temporarily shield themselves. With Adama certain to be killed, the Cylons vote to jump away, but Roslin convinces them to stay with the fleet. Adama and his allies, including some former mutineers, march to retake the CIC. During a skirmish, Anders is shot in the neck, and Kara convinces Romo Lampkin to help her carry him to Dr. Cottle. In the CIC, Gaeta and Zarek are in the middle of a standoff with President Roslin. Zarek, presuming that Adama has already been executed, tells Roslin that Adama is dead, and Roslin vows to take vengeance. Gaeta orders the ship to jump away, but Tyrol has sabotaged the FTL drive, and Gaeta realizes the mutiny is failing. Rather than attacking as Zarek presses him to do, Gaeta orders his men to stand down. Moments later, Adama and his men storm the CIC, and the mutineers give up without a fight. After the CIC is reclaimed, Tyrol, who is still in the engine room, notices and inspects a heavily damaged section of wall. Long linear grooves appear to have been gouged into the steel. It is unclear what caused this damage. Later, Gaeta has a conversation with Gaius Baltar where he expands upon his former hopes and dreams and his wish for people to know who he really was and why he did what he did. Baltar and Gaeta make peace with each other over their past differences with Baltar acknowledging an understanding of who Gaeta is. As a result of their actions, Admiral Adama has Gaeta and Zarek executed by a firing squad that he commands personally. Moments before being executed, Gaeta's phantom limb pain stops, indicating that he is finally at peace with himself.

Set in Sussex, it is a story of World War II on the home front; it features preparing for and hosting children evacuated from London. Barne and Visitors won the annual Carnegie Medal for British children's books. Dodd, Mead published a U.S. edition within the calendar year. Plot summary The setting is the Sussex countryside during the summer holidays of 1939. The four Farrar children are spending the holidays with their eccentric Aunt Myra. War seems far away, but is soon to impinge on their lives. Seventeen young Cockney evacuees who have never been out of London are coming to stay at Steadings, a nearby farmhouse which has been standing empty. The Farrars help with the preparations, finding staff and generally organizing everything. Then the evacuees arrive, and the Farrars find themselves out of their depth. Origins The author knew the subject first hand, being involved in Operation Pied Piper, the initial phase of the evacuation of children from the cities to the English countryside during the Second World War. As a member of the Women's Voluntary Service she was responsible for the reception of evacuees in her native Sussex.Owen Dudley Edwards: British Children's Fiction in the Second World War, Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp. 258-59. Literary significance and reception Visitors from London reflected a real-life situation with serious intent and was important in its day. Kitty Barne was a popular and prolific writer of the time but her books have dated.Pat Thomson, \\"The Carnegie Medal – Seventy Years of Choosing the Best\\", Carousel 36, June 2007. Visitors from London was the first of the Carnegie Medal winners to go out of print. That may have been partly because of its topicality, but it has been criticized as being \\"patronising in its attitude to evacuees and nowhere near the author's best work\\".Keith Barker, In the Realms of Gold: The Story of the Carnegie Medal, Julia MacRae Books, 1986. When the book was published in America in 1941, the New York Times was enthusiastic: \\"This is the first story for boys and girls of their contemporaries in wartime England and one which may be unreservedly recommended, for they will find in it much of the gay courage and matter-of- fact acceptance of conditions which their parents have found in Mrs. Miniver and Letter from England.\\"\\"In War-Time England ...\\" (review). The New York Times, March 1941. Preview (subscription required). Again it is the social context which is considered the main point. The humour of the book is praised by Marcus Crouch, who says: \\"Kitty Barne sought out, with characteristic sincerity and sharp observation, the comic, as well as the pathetic, elements in the strange social experiment of the Evacuation... [exploring] with good- humoured shrewdness the dilemmas of the visitors and the visited.\\" Marcus Crouch, The Nesbit Tradition, Ernest Benn, 1972, pp 24-25.

The new carriages had different bogie spacing and a more rounded profile, to allow general route availability. They were classed A, with the initial batch of 92 being built at Otahuhu Railway Workshops and Addington Railway Workshops. It took until 1945 to complete the order. Further carriages were ordered after 1938, but due to the Second World War, they were never delivered. The 1951 Annual Report noted 127 carriages were \\"on order\\" but not under construction, this was substantially reduced to five with the ordering of the 88-seater railcars in 1955, and disappeared altogether in 1957. There was a large amount of variation in the body arrangement between batches. This primarily reflected the carriages use – second class (X25480), first-class, first and second-class composite (X25916) or semi sleeping. There were also variations between carriages intended for North Island and South Island use. South Island first- class carriages (X25495) were built with pressure ventilation and a coupe compartment at one end, while North Island first Class carriages (X25485) used roof-based vents like second class carriages, and did not include a coupe. Up to 12 second-class carriages were converted into 20 bed ambulance carriages for use in World War Two and after the war were converted for general use, six of which were converted for first-class use, with four receiving seats of a more modern design, that were later used for the Endeavour and The Connoisseur car. Eight out of 11 Semi sleeper carriages were rebuilt as 16-berth all- sleeper carriages, one rebuilt as a 14-berth sleeper because it retained the original 4-berth cabin. 56-foot carriages quickly became the mainstay of the passenger fleet, being used on the NZRs important trains in their red livery. NZR JA class steam loco hauling two NZR 56-foot carriages followed by several NZR 50-foot carriages on an excursion train The carriages were long and high. The width was at the waist reducing to at about window height so that the carriages could run over all NZR lines. The extra width allowed second class seating to have one double seat each side of the aisle so seating four per row; but first-class carriages had seating for three per row, a single seat on one side and two single seats on the other side of the aisle. The seating for passengers was: * First class: 31 passengers in single reclining chair seats (a few had 32 or 35 seats) * Second class: 56 passengers (initially 59 for some 1939-40 Addington carriages with one toilet, but rebuilt to 56-seat with two toilets 1942-43). * Composite: 14 first-class and 28 second-class; total 42 passengers. * First class coupe: 29 & 2 triple width seats seating 6; total 35 passengers The carriages had an enclosed vestibule at each end. The first- class coupe carriages with a small coupe compartment seating 6 had only one lavatory at one end with the coupe compartment at the other end, but most had two lavatories, one at each end, often marked \\"Gents\\" and \\"Ladies\\".  Guards van variant In 1942 two Guard's vans were built on the same type underframe to create vans to match the 56-foot carriages. The first two vans had narrow vestibules at both ends, and a further 19 vans built from 1943-44 only had this at one end. These vans were used on principal expresses in both islands until the 1980s. 1970s: upgrades NZR began overhauling a number of 56-foot carriages for a new South Island train called the \\"Southerner\\". These carriages were painted blue with a light blue stripe bordered by gold on the sides and white roofs and received new seating and upholstery to match. Some carriages were highly modified into buffet carriages, the first buffet carriages on NZR since 1918. Classified AB, these carriages had a kitchenette and a full-length buffet counter installed. A similar set of carriages was upgraded in the North Island for the new \\"Endeavour\\" train from Wellington to Napier. Another set of carriages (including sleeping carriages) was overhauled for a new overnight train between Wellington and Auckland called the \\"Northerner\\". These carriages were the first to be turned out with the new \\"Supavent\\" style of windows, and were painted a mustard yellow instead of blue. Later, carriages for suburban use in Wellington and Auckland were refurbished with \\"Supavent\\" windows as well. All these upgraded carriages were running on new bogies, after a successful trial of a new \\"deluxe\\" bogie under 56-foot carriage A 1622. The bogie type used was initially the same as the steam heat vans (X27750, known as a \\"Kinki\\" bogie), and later the type of bogie use by the FM class guards vans (X28020, known as an \\"FM\\" bogie), based on the type of bogies used under the Silver Star classed X28250. This improved the ride quality of the carriages. 1980s: panoramic glazing AO 175 while on an excursion. The next major change for the 56-foot carriages occurred in 1988: the first carriage with 1 meter high panoramic windows, AS2500, was introduced in the South Island for use on the TranzAlpine and later re- numbered ASO27, and was quickly followed by further upgraded carriages, primarily on the TranzAlpine. The second servery car upgraded to this large window configuration was to be numbered AS2517 but was released as ASO 14 – the O for observation denoted the large panoramic windows, and subsequent carriages followed this classification. Further carriages were upgraded over the next five years, and some were fitted with air conditioning, a feature not previously used in New Zealand carriages. Four carriages were modified with lounge seating and a large panoramic window in one end, one car incorporating a servery, but no special classification distinguished these carriages from the other AOs or ASOs. Other carriages were given upgraded seating and new paint colours but remained on the older style bogies and without air conditioning, for commuter and charter use. Later, some of these carriages included air conditioning but retained the smaller Supavent windows  Current use  KiwiRail does not own any 56-foot carriages, a large number of the 56-foot carriages are now either with small train operating companies such as Dunedin Railways with 21 carriages or in preservation with many railway societies, some which use the carriages on mainline excursions. =Dunedin Railways= Dunedin Railways branded AO class carriage at Dunedin Railway Station. Dunedin tourism railway operator Dunedin Railways has phased in 56-foot carriages.\\"Technical information' on Taieri Gorge Railway website, retrieved 2009-05-10 In September 2007 Dunedin Railways announced it had purchased twelve small-window 56-foot carriages formerly used on the Wairarapa Connection. The first of these, A2325, was prepared at a cost of $45,000 and ready in September 2008. Although A2325 was the first carriage put in service, a 13th 56-foot carriage A2095 had been purchased separately earlier and conversion begun to a buffet carriage, which entered service in November 2009. Original plans were to have all 13 small window 56-foot carriages in service by 2013, the cost of a rebuild for these carriages was more than expected due to poor condition of the vehicles. The best condition vehicles were rebuilt for service with the remainder held onto awaiting possible fleet developments and disposal of AO carriages by KiwiRail, with privately-owned A3022 and leased AO77 added to the fleet and a new livery around 2013. In 2014 Dunedin Railways offered to store the laid up AO carriages in Middlemarch for KiwiRail, with Dunedin Railways obtaining six of these carriages when they were sold in 2018 along with AO77, giving them seven AO's in total. AO152 was the first of these carriages to be rebuilt for service and was given an all- steel body frame in the process. It is now reclassified ADR152 to distinguish it from a standard AO carriage. =Heritage railways= Weka Pass Railways AC 3548 in Waikari. Many other heritage groups have acquired examples of 56-foot carriages for use on heritage railways or mainline excursions. Most prominent among these is Steam Incorporated, who own 15 carriages of this type (though not all are operational), closely followed by Mainline Steam who have 14 (all of the AO/ASO big window variety). Feilding & District Steam Railway and the Glenbrook Vintage Railway also have large numbers of 56-foot carriages in their fleet, making the 56-foot carriage type the most popular among main line operating groups. Of note, all of the AO/ASO big window 56-foot carriage variety were sold to either Dunedin Railways or heritage organisations, although ASO14 was later scrapped by Mainline Steam due to its poor condition.

It aired on television in the United States and Canada on February 13, 2009. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,556. This episode contains the first use of the term \\"The Colony.\\" Plot The episode follows stories on two timelines: the current events in the Colonial fleet, and events aboard Cavil and Boomer's basestar in flashback, beginning at the end of the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and jumping forward until it converges with the present. In a flashback to the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, it is revealed that Ellen Tigh resurrected in the Cylon fleet after Saul poisoned her. Her resurrection restores all of Ellen's true memories. At first, she is known only to Cavil. Ellen tries to persuade Cavil to stop chasing the humans, but he refuses, saying he wants justice for the enslavement of the Cylons that led to the First Cylon War. Ellen refers to Cavil as John, his model's original name, which he dislikes. It is revealed that he was modeled after Ellen's father. On board the Galactica, Tyrol shows Admiral Adama the damage to the ship's hull he discovered at the end of the previous episode (see \\"Blood on the Scales\\"), and warns that the ship may not survive another jump without repair. Tyrol indicates that when Galactica was built, corners were cut, compromising its structural integrity. Also, the ship has taken accumulated battle damage as well as the jump into New Caprica's atmosphere which strained the ship's structural integrity. Adama reinstates Tyrol to the rank of Chief, and asks him to fix the ship, insisting on the repair crew being all human. Repair efforts begin, but by performing a special type of inspection, Tyrol discovers extensive micro fractures throughout the bulkheads that cannot be easily repaired, and recommends an organic Cylon compound, which Adama adamantly refuses. As a side-effect of the bullet still lodged in his brain, Samuel Anders is able to recover memories of the complete origin and purpose of the Final Five. Three others of the Final Five and Kara Thrace gather around his bedside, begging for him to be kept out of surgery until he can finish explaining. Anders says that the Cylons, which were the thirteenth tribe of Kobol, began procreating naturally on Earth and finally lost resurrection technology. Anders and the other Final Five were researchers who worked on reinventing the ancient technology. On Colonial One, Lee Adama proposes assembling a new Quorum. He says it should reflect the current times, representing the ships in the fleet rather than the old 12 colonies. Laura Roslin agrees, and tells him to assemble the new Quorum himself. She says she will remain as president in title, with Lee assuming the responsibilities of the office. She says her only reservation about him is that he sometimes does what is right, rather than what is smart. In the infirmary, Sam continues his explanation. The Final Five re-developed the ancient resurrection process, and created a resurrection ship in orbit around Earth. When nuclear war destroyed the Earth Colony, the Final Five were killed but resurrected on the ship. They made their way to the Twelve Colonies with the intention of warning the humans against repeating old mistakes and provoking another war with Centurions. They lacked faster-than-light technology, so they traveled at speeds near, but below, the speed of light. In accordance with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, due to time dilation only a short time passed for them, while thousands of years passed for the rest of the universe. They arrived only to find that the other Colonies were already engulfed in war with their own Cylon Centurions. The Centurions had already created the hybrid models, but nothing that could survive on its own. The Five offered to help the Centurions if, in exchange, they ended the war. The Five gave them resurrection technology and created eight humanoid models, although the fleet previously only knew of the existence of seven of them. Kara asks Sam about the eighth Cylon, designated Number Seven, thinking it might be her, but Sam tells her that it was a male named Daniel. In another flashback, Ellen tells Cavil that she knows he killed all the Daniels, because Cavil was jealous of them. Cavil responded that the Daniels \\"didn't thrive.\\" Cavil shows her images of the temple on the algae planet. Ellen says the temple wasn't her invention. It was created by the thirteenth tribe on their way from Kobol to Earth. Cavil mentions that D'Anna saw the faces of the Five in that temple, and Ellen says that was not because of anything she did. She suggested it was an act of the \\"One God.\\" Cavil is resentful that the Five gave him human weaknesses. Ellen realizes that he sent the Five to live among the humans because he wanted them to suffer. Boomer asks Ellen if she feels remorse for what she did for the Cylons. She replies that she does not, because what she did was a good thing. She gave them free will and the ability to feel compassion. Sam's doctors insist that the surgery cannot wait anymore, and they start the surgery before he's finished explaining everything. As he is being wheeled into the operating theater, he urges Saul Tigh to stay with the fleet. In yet another flashback, Cavil informs Ellen about the destruction of the Resurrection Hub by the humans and the rebel Cylons and tells her that she will have to recreate the resurrection technology for them. She claims that she will need the other Final Five in order to do this, however Cavil does not believe her. He tells her that if she doesn't give him the information, he'll extract the information from her brain using a psychophysical process. In a flashback to two days ago, Boomer comes to Ellen, supposedly to escort her to the surgery. Ellen tells her that she should have brought a tumbrel (a cart used to transport condemned prisoners during the French revolution), implying that Cavil's procedure is some form of punishment or execution. Boomer leads Ellen to a captured Raptor, saying she is forgiving her. They escape the basestar and then jump away. Sam comes out of surgery and Starbuck tries to talk to him, but paramedic Ishay points out on the monitor that he has almost no brain function. In his room, Adama notices large cracks in the bulkheads, and finally relents, calling Tyrol and telling him to do whatever it takes to save the ship, presumably including the Cylon-based biological structural reinforcements.

It aired on television in the United States and Canada. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,556. Plot summary While running CAP, a combined Viper and Heavy Raider squadron detect the approach of a Raptor that has been logged as missing for years. After identifying the pilot as a Number Eight, Galactica allows the Raptor to land. To the shock of everyone, Ellen Tigh is onboard, having been believed dead for eighteen months. Tyrol warmly greets the Eight pilot before identifying her as Boomer to Admiral Adama. Upon learning that Boomer is the pilot, Adama has her locked in the ship's brig. Ellen and Saul reunite and, after making love, go together to visit Sam Anders, who is still comatose. Tory Foster, Galen Tyrol, a Six and an Eight are also by Anders' bedside. The Cylons propose that since Ellen has returned, they should leave the human fleet, especially since Caprica Six is pregnant with Saul's fully-Cylon child and they no longer need humans in order to reproduce. Ellen did not know about Caprica Six being pregnant, and is angry at Saul as she was never able to conceive children, and Caprica could only have become pregnant if he truly loved her. Furthermore, because the other Cylons are the Final Five's creations, she views Saul's relationship with Caprica in an incestuous light. A vote is had by the Final Five on whether they should stay with the human fleet, and they promise to be bound by the results of that vote. Tory Foster and Galen Tyrol vote they go, Saul Tigh votes they stay and they assume from what Anders has said previously he would also vote to stay, which leaves Ellen with the deciding vote. She states that she needs more time, and goes to visit Caprica Six in her quarters. She \\"accidentally\\" tells Caprica Six that she and Saul had sex, before telling her she believed Saul loved Caprica more than he loved her. Ellen then calls another meeting, and says she has decided that the Cylon fleet should leave. Saul refuses to leave, and Ellen says this is because he loves the ship and William Adama more than herself or Caprica Six. Caprica becomes upset and starts to lose the baby. He and Ellen unite to try to tell Caprica that Saul does love her which Ellen believes will save the baby, but Caprica Six still suffers a miscarriage. Saul goes to Adama for support, revealing that the baby's name was \\"Liam\\", short for William. (Writer Jane Espenson confirmed that Saul wanted to name his child after his best friend.) Elsewhere, Tyrol and teams of Cylons attempt to fix the ship by using a Cylon polymer to grow into the cracks. Gaius Baltar rejoins his believers, who have taken up arms in order to get and keep supplies, but gives some away to starving people in \\"Dogsville\\" before the rest is stolen by the Sons of Ares. He appeals to Admiral Adama, who supplies him with weapons to prevent it happening in the future. Near the end of the episode, the monitor near Anders indicates that he has higher brain functions and his eyes flutter as in REM sleep. The episode ends with Roslin and Adama walking through the ship past a Six and an Eight working on the ship's hull and a group of mixed human and Cylon pilots. A Six has stopped in front of the Wall, staring at the photos, and Roslin realises that the Cylons have begun memorialising their dead there in the same way as the humans. Cut scenes Some material expanding on the situation in Dogsville was cut as the episode was originally eleven minutes too long for broadcast. In the cut scenes, it is explained that due to three years of war and a mutiny, there are no longer enough marines to maintain order in the fleet and they have been forced to retreat from Dogsville. The Sons of Ares take control of the food supply, except for the stash held by Baltar's cult. Lee Adama and Roslin discuss the possibility of bringing in Centurions to provide more security in civilian areas, however, Admiral Adama is firmly opposed. Thus, when Baltar approaches him for better weapons, Adama is faced with two options: > Effectively, the question for Adama is, allow a criminal gang to control the > food supply, or allow Baltar's crazy cultists to control it. And Baltar's > group, now armed to the teeth, would also serve as a civilian security > force, which Adama figures is better than using centurions. In the end, > Baltar's militia is the lesser of two evils.

Early work The 5 Foot Vertical Wind Tunnel was built to study spinning characteristics of aircraft. It was an open throat tunnel capable of a maximum speed of 80 mph. NACA engineer Charles H. Zimmerman designed the tunnel starting in 1928. Zimmerman worked at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in the 1930s on a variety of research topics, including loads,M. J. Bamber and C. H.

Zimmerman (1936) Effect of changes in tail arrangement upon the spinning of a low-wing monoplane model, NACA TN-570. During this time, he was also thinking about much more novel aspects of flight, especially how stability might be maintained. He theorized that the natural balancing reflexes of a person could be adequate to control very small flight vehicles, a concept he called \\"kinesthetic control\\". He was also interested in aspects that could lead to Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft. Novel Flight Vehicles Zimmerman's research posited aircraft having flat circular bodies, sans wings, as their lifting surface. In the 1940s, Zimmerman and the Navy began researching this idea, which led to the Vought XF5U, nicknamed the \\"flying pancake\\". In 1953, Hiller Aircraft contracted with the Office of Naval Research to combine several research ideas, including Zimmerman's \\"kinesthetic\\" theory, to produce an airworthy \\"flying platform\\".

It aired on television in the United States and Canada on February 27, 2009. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,556. Plot Kara Thrace is depressed that her husband, Samuel Anders, is still in a coma, with little good news from Dr. Cottle concerning his condition. She has returned to a bleak daily routine after the events of her leading the fleet to Earth, when she had felt special, as if she had a purpose and knew what she was doing for the first time in her life. She is also plagued by nightmares of the body that was presumably her own, crashed on Earth. Thrace makes friends with the bar's piano player, and slowly reveals to him that her father used to play the piano too. During the process, she discusses her childhood and her feelings towards her father, who left the family and never contacted her or her mother again, much as the piano player did with his own family. Thrace assists the piano player with writing a new song. Eventually, he convinces a reluctant Thrace to play the piano too. The piano player shows affection towards Starbuck much in the same way her father did. Together they play a song she faintly remembers from her childhood, and eventually she realizes a drawing given to her earlier by Hera Agathon is not a drawing of stars, as Hera said, but a sequence of musical notes that matches the song from her memory. Together, Thrace and the piano player reconstruct the song, which turns out to be the music the four of the Final Five present on Galactica heard throughout the events of Crossroads Pt. II. Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh, and Tory Foster, who were all lingering in the bar while Thrace and the piano player were reconstructing the song, confront her about the song's origin, to which she replies that she used to play it as a child with her father. A flashback to Kara's childhood reveals that Kara's father looked exactly like the piano player. When Kara turns to the piano player, he has mysteriously vanished. In the meantime, Sharon \\"Boomer\\" Valerii is about to be extradited by the Colonial fleet to the rebel Cylons, who plan to try her for treason for siding with Cavil. They seek the death penalty; now that there is no Cylon resurrection available anymore, death would be permanent. Boomer tricks Galen Tyrol into helping her to leave the Galactica by claiming that she still sees a future for them together. Through Cylon mental projection, she shows Tyrol a home she has \\"constructed\\" for them both, including their child. She beats Sharon \\"Athena\\" Agathon and ties her up, putting her in a closet, just before Karl \\"Helo\\" Agathon walks in on them. She has sex with him, while the tied up Athena watches through an opening, gagged and unable to speak. She then kidnaps Hera, escapes by stealing a Raptor, and causes damage to the Galactica by performing an FTL jump too close to the ship. The episode ends with Tyrol's devastation after realizing that Boomer tricked him and he has unwittingly helped her kidnap Hera. Ratings \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" was seen by 1.657 million viewers (live viewing plus same day digital video recorder viewing), about 100,000 more viewers than for the previous episode.Seidman, Robert. \\"WWE RAW, The Closer and President Obama Lead Cable Viewing.\\" TVBytheNumbers.com. March 3, 2009. Production Writer David Weddle comments on Boomer's motives: \\"It's difficult to say someone who did that loves the Chief, and yet in her damaged way, I think she did and still does love him.\\" Due to the musical focus in this episode, composer Bear McCreary was involved in production of the episode from the earliest drafts. While attempting to compose a new song together with Kara Thrace, the piano player (Slick) moves his fingers across the keyboard searching for a melody, a riff which Thrace recognizes as sounding similar to a classical piece called “Nomion’s 3rd Sonata, 2nd Movement” which in actuality is the opening fanfare to the original Battlestar Galactica: a piece called “Exploration” written by Stu Phillips. Critical reception Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found that the episode was an excellent showcase for both Katee Sackhoff and Grace Park, and praised director Michael Nankin who \\"[infused] this episode with the qualities of a nightmare.\\" Michael Saba of Paste Magazine called the episode an \\"exercise in building tension through omission\\" and felt the episode was \\"excellent\\". IGN writer Eric Goldman praised the writers of the show for the plot turns in the episode, in particular the fact that Boomer's returning to the fleet with Ellen Tigh was in fact just a ruse. Goldman felt the subplot involving Kara was \\"a bit meandering\\" but that Katee Sackhoff and Roark Critchlow gave strong performances. Cinema Blend felt the writers \\"threw a neat little curveball\\" with the Roark Critchlow piano playing character being Thrace's father. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly felt the Boomer storyline was \\"awesome\\" but was less impressed by the storyline involving Thrace, feeling \\"that it didn't tell us anything new\\" and that the writers had written a very obvious ending to the subplot.

The candle looks like a hammer, as it has a long lower wick and a short body at the top of the candlestick with little or no upper wick. In order for a candle to be a valid hammer most traders say the lower wick must be two times greater than the size of the body portion of the candle, and the body of the candle must be at the upper end of the trading range. When you see the hammer form in a downtrend this is a sign of a potential reversal in the market as the long lower wick represents a period of trading where the sellers were initially in control but the buyers were able to reverse that control and drive prices back up to close near the high for the day, thus the short body at the top of the candle. After seeing this chart pattern form in the market most traders will wait for the next period to open higher than the close of the previous period to confirm that the buyers are actually in control. Two additional things that traders will look for to place more significance on the pattern are a long lower wick and an increase in volume for the time period that formed the hammer.

It was southeast of downtown at the corner of Nolensville Pike US 31A/US 41A and Harding Place (SR 255) in the Paragon Mills neighborhood. Built in 1966, it was demolished in 2005 for a Walmart. Harding Mall is notable for being the first enclosed shopping mall in the state of Tennessee. History The mall was announced as early as January 1962, as a 200,000 sq ft, $2.5 million venture. Plans originally called for the center to be built with an innovative design with no doors, featuring only \\"invisible walls of controlled air to keep weather out\\", and for the center to be finished by August 1963. Ground was broken on the site for the now $6 million mall in April 1963, in a ceremony where mayor Beverly Briley broke ground with a silver-plated shovel. Others in attendance were Robert C Hilton, president of Castner Knott, Raymond C Sanders, president of Harding Mall Associates and Harding Mall Corp., and Andrew Benedict, president of First American National Bank. By this point a large number of tenants had been confirmed, including anchor Castner Knott, and junior anchors Walgreens, G. C. Murphy, F. W. Woolworth, and A&P.; The A&P; supermarket opened on August 18, 1965 and First American National Bank opened on October 1, 1965, followed by anchor Castner Knott on March 14, 1966. The single-screen Capri Theatre, operated by Martin Theatres, opened March 26, 1969. An expansion to Castner Knott began in 1973, and was completed by late 1974. A Service Merchandise \\"annex\\" opened in the former G. C. Murphy store in mid 1980, said to focus on toys and sporting goods in order to complement a larger Service Merchandise showroom elsewhere in Nashville. Marshalls opened on May 5, 1983, in the former Service Merchandise space, which had been previously downgraded to a surplus store. The Capri Twin Theatres came under the management of Carmike Cinemas in 1982 with their acquisition of Martin Theatres, and was demolished and replaced by a 6-screen Carmike Cinemas during the 1988 renovation. The 1988 renovation was announced in December, and was enacted by new owners David E Miller and Robert R Brown who had purchased the mall for $9.85 million earlier that month. Plans called to renovate the existing 264,000 sq ft and adding an additional 90,000 sq ft. The plans also included construction of a freestanding strip center on the property, and several restaurants. The new 6-screen Carmike Cinemas opened in May 1990, followed by the mall itself whose renovation was completed in fall that year. Castner Knott converted to Dillard's in 1998, with their acquisition of parent company Mercantile Stores Company, Inc. earlier that year. Carmike Cinemas, since downgraded to a discount theater, closed on August 24, 2000 along with Murfreesboro, Tennessee's Stone River 6 theater. The mall closed at the end of March 2005, with plans for a Walmart Supercenter on the site announced by June. Demolition began on July 5, 2005, and the new Walmart Supercenter opened on January 19, 2007. Despite the mall's demolition, the area is still referred to as the Harding Mall area in advertising.

History Schenck was born in Somerville, New Jersey, and moved to the state of Florida in 1980, where he attended Central High School. He graduated from Pasco-Hernando Community College, now known as Pasco-Hernando State College in 1995 and from the University of Central Florida in 1998. Following graduation, Schenck returned to Central High School, where he taught social studies before running for the Hernando County Commission in 2002, defeating incumbent Commissioner Chris Kinglsey. Schenck resigned from the Commission in July 2006 so that he could focus on his campaign for the State House of Representatives. In September 2014, Representative Schenck was cited for his involvement in an automobile accident, however adjudication was withheld at trial. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Dave Russell was unable to seek another term in the legislature in 2006, Schenck ran to succeed him and resigned his position as County Commissioner. In the Republican primary, he defeated Joseph Mattingly by a comfortable margin, winning with 58% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Glenn Claytor, the Democratic nominee and a retired developer. Claytor, who was forty years older than Schenck, attacked him for his youth and inexperience, noting that, \\"It isn't just the age disparity. It's life experience,\\" which Schenck responded by observing that he had held elected office previously while Claytor had not. Owing to the contentious nature of the campaign, Schenck eked out a narrow win over Clayor, defeating him with 51% of the vote and by about a thousand votes. In 2008, Schenck was initially going to face Joseph Puglia, the highly touted Democratic nominee, but Puglia withdrew from the race in September, citing his wife's deteriorating health. Puglia was quickly replaced by Jason Melton, the President of the Hernando County Bar Association, though Puglia's name remained on the ballot. Schenck managed to with re-election comfortably over Melton and Green Party candidate Sarah Roman, winning 53% of the vote to Melton's 41% and Roman's 6%. During his campaign for a third term in the legislature, he faced former Hernando County Commissioner Diane Rowden, whom he attacked for living outside the district, though she purchased a house in the district during the campaign, and for \\"raising our taxes and over- regulating our small businesses.\\" Schenck defeated Rowden in the general election, winning more than 60% of the vote. When the legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Schenck was moved to the 35th District, which contained most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 44th District. He was challenged in the general election by another former County Commissioner, Rose Rocco, who was endorsed by the Tampa Bay Times, but ultimately turned her challenge away, winning election to his final term in the legislature with 56% of the vote. As his fourth term drew to a close, Schenck, though he was mentioned as a potential candidate to replace retiring County Commissioner Dave Russell, exited elected politics.

It was brought to extinction by excessive hunting and habitat destruction around 1850.  Taxonomy  It is unknown from where the original specimen (the holotype), on which Carl Linnaeus based \\"Rhinoceros\\" bicornis in 1758, was collected. It was even proposed that it was indeed the skull of an Indian rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) with a faked second horn, as Linnaeus erroneously noted India as occurrence. This was fixed formally in 1911, when O. Thomas declared the Cape of Good Hope as type locality of D. bicornis. Therefore, this population formed the base of the nominal subspecies of the black rhinoceros. Later this subspecies became frequently mistaken for the south-western black rhinoceros, but the latter has to be considered a separate subspecies (D. bicornis occidentalis).  Description  D. bicornis bicornis was the largest of all black rhino subspecies. While the differentiation of subspecies is mostly based on skull and body proportions, as well as details of the dentition, the external appearance of the southern subspecies is not exactly known because no photos exist. The skull was the largest of any known subspecies and proportionally large compared to the body. The limbs were short but slender and the skin folds were probably only weakly pronounced.  Ecology  This subspecies was restricted to well-vegetated regions, in contrast to others that are well adapted to desertic conditions.  IUCN status  As the IUCN considers the living northern Namibian black rhino populations (D. bicornis occidentalis) to belong to D. bicornis bicornis, the latter is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" instead of \\"extinct\\". This synonymy, based upon du Toit (1987) was, however, considered erroneous by Groves and Grubb (2011).

It is considered a classic of 20th-century Chinese literature. History Lao She began the novel in spring, 1936, and it was published in installments in the magazine Yuzhou feng (\\"Cosmic wind\\") beginning in January, 1937.How I came to write the novel \\"Camel Xiangzi\\", included in Foreign Languages Press edition. Lao She returned to China from the United States after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In an afterword dated September, 1954, included in the Foreign Languages Press edition of Rickshaw Boy, Lao She said that he had edited the manuscript (\\"taken out some of the coarser language and some unnecessary descriptions\\") and he expressed regret for the lack of hope expressed in the original edition. In 1945, Evan King published an unauthorized translation of the novel. He cut, rearranged, rewrote, invented characters, and changed the ending. The girl student and One Pock Li are King's, not Lao She's. King also added considerable embellishment to the two seduction scenes. Despite the liberties taken, the book was a bestseller in the United States and a Book-of-the-Month club selection. Plot Set in the 1920s, the novel's protagonist is an orphan peasant who leaves for Beijing to earn a living. Xiangzi is a young, hardworking, well-built rickshaw puller who dreams of owning his own rickshaw. Just when he has earned enough to buy one, it is confiscated by warlord soldiers. As he leaves, he spots some camels captured by the soldiers. He takes the camels and escapes and later sells them, earning the nickname Camel. However, the cash Xiangzi obtains from this is not enough for him to buy another new rickshaw – providence decrees that he must toil once more. A police secret agent later extorts him into paying him his savings, leaving Xiangzi impoverished again. Left with no choice, Xiangzi returns to work for Old Master Liu, the boss of a thriving rickshaw rental company. Although he tries to be honest and down to earth, Xiangzi finds himself entangled between Old Master Liu and his stout, manipulative daughter Tiger Girl, ten years his senior. Tiger Girl, who is carrying a torch for him, insists on marrying Xiangzi after pretending to be made pregnant by him. Her father disowns her and the couple live together, progressively made poor by her spendthrift ways. Later, Tiger Girl becomes pregnant by Xiangzi and grows even fatter as she awaits her delivery due her laziness and greediness for food. When Tiger Girl dies during childbirth and Xiangzi's infant child is stillborn, Xiangzi is distraught. He later finds meaning in life again in a female neighbour, the meek and long-suffering Little Fuzi, who is forced into prostitution by her idle father. When Xiangzi has earned enough to redeem her from the brothel, he is devastated to find she has committed suicide. The harsh realities of life taught Xiangzi that decency and hard work have little meaning in this pragmatic, dog-eat-dog world. He becomes a lazy, degenerate and unscrupulous good-for-nothing, no different from those he looked down on early in his life, spending his days gambling, cheating and whoring. Subject matter and themes The major subject matter of Rickshaw Boy is the way in which the hero makes his living pulling a rickshaw, the options he faces and choices he makes, and especially the fundamental issues of whether to work independently or as a servant to a family, and whether to rent or own a rickshaw. Additionally, the novel describes a series of adventures he has and his interactions with a number of other characters. Beijing  \\"filthy, beautiful, decadent, bustling, chaotic, idle, lovable\\"—is important as a backdrop for the book. \\"The only friend he had was this ancient city.\\" (p. 31) The book explores the intimate relationship between man and machine (the rickshaw), and the evolution of that relationship. The relationship is both financial—requiring months and years of calculation to graduate from being a renter to being an owner—and physical. \\"His strength seemed to permeate every part of the rickshaw. . . . he was energetic, smooth in his motions, precise. He didn't appear to be in any hurry and yet he ran very fast . . . . \\" An important theme of the book is the economic precariousness of the hero's life. \\"No matter how hard you work or how ambitious you are, you must not start a family, you must not get sick, and you must not make a single mistake!\\" \\"If you avoid dying of starvation when young, good for you. But it was almost impossible to avoid dying of starvation when old.\\" Further, the book explores personality characteristics and their relationship to economic existence, especially tolerance for risk, tolerance for hard work, and assertiveness, and personal standards of human dignity. \\"He had a strong body, a patient disposition, ambition, yet he allowed people to treat him like a pig or a dog and he couldn't keep a job.\\" Isolation and individualism are important themes in the book. \\"His life might well be ruined by his own hands but he wasn't about to sacrifice anything for anybody. He who works for himself knows how to destroy himself. These are the two starting points of Individualism.\\" Historical significance The characterization or point of view in Rickshaw Boy reflects the influence of Russian literature in China in general, and particularly on the way that influence was transferred to China by Lu Xun in stories such as The True Story of Ah Q and \\"Diary of a Madman\\".Douwe W. Fokkema, in \\"Lu Xun: The Impact of Russian Literature,\\" in Merle Goldman, ed., Modern Chinese Literature in the May Fourth Era (Cambridge: Harvard, 1977), writes, \\"The heroes in these stories are all outcasts and underdogs, in varying degrees . . . . Xiangzi, the main figure in Luotuo xiangzi (Rickshaw boy [1937]), who becomes the victim of his own stubborn toiling, fits into this category.\\" (p. 100) The subject matter of Rickshaw Boy aligned with concerns of Chinese leftists and the Chinese Communist Party. For instance, the final sentences read, \\"Handsome, ambitious, dreamer of fine dreams, selfish, individualistic sturdy, great Hsiang Tzu. No one knows how many funerals he marched in, and no one knows when or where he was able to get himself buried, that degenerate, selfish, unlucky offspring of society's diseased womb, a ghost caught in Individualism's blind alley.\\" Lao She went on to play a leading role in literary associations endorsed by the government, such as the All-China Federation of Literature and Art. According to the introductory section of the Foreign Languages Press (Beijing) English translation, \\"Before Liberation [Lao She] wrote many works of literature, including his best novel Camel Xiangzi (or Rickshaw Boy) to expose and denounce the old society. While he now enjoys prestige in China and was named a \\"People's Artist\\" and \\"Great Master of Language\\", at the beginning of the cultural revolution he was severely persecuted. The Red Guards paraded him through the streets and beat him in public. Being humiliated both mentally and physically, he, according to the official record, committed suicide by drowning himself in Beijing's Taiping Lake in 1966., additional text. English translations Reynal & Hitchcock (New York) published an English translation by Evan King in 1945 under the English title Rickshaw Boy (\\"by Lau Shaw\\"). According to Jean M.

However his first team opportunities were limited and after 16 total appearances in 2 years at Glenmalure Park he signed for Drogheda United in 1985. Following two seasons at Galway United he signed for Shelbourne in 1988. He transferred to Leicester City in February 1990. Unable to break into the Leicester first team he was loaned to Exeter City in December 1990, playing six times. In March 1991 he joined Shrewsbury Town where he played 46 league games (almost half as substitute) before being released at the end of the 1992-93 season. In August 1993 he joined Torquay United, making his debut in midfield as Torquay lost on penalties in the League Cup to Hereford United, with his league debut at right-back in place of Lee Barrow in the 2-1 win away to Darlington on 28 August. He switched to left-back, in place of Scott Colcombe, with Barrow restored at right-back, for the next game, a 1-1 draw at home to Carlisle United and played in the following game, a 3-3 draw at home to Colchester United in which Adrian Foster scored a hat-trick. However, these were his only games for Torquay and he left, joining Bridgnorth Town. In December 1993 he played 5 league games for Cobh Ramblers and in January 1994 he moved back to his first club. In his two stints at the Hoops O'Toole was unfortunate in that the team were winning the league on those occasions so first team opportunities were limited. He joined Halifax Town in April 1994, playing seven times in the Conference before being released at the end of the season. He spent the 1994–95 and 1995-96 seasons with Stafford Rangers.

The Church of St. John the Baptist St. John the Baptist is the church located in Ditton Priors and was dedicated to Saint Mary The Virgin in the 15th century. Parts of the church are thought to date back to the 12th century.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22878#s9 The church is located in the centre of the village, on higher ground than its surroundings. The majority of the church is built from Dhustone, from the nearby Clee Hill. The interior of the church houses stained glass and an open timber roof. The churchyard contains a war grave of a King's Shropshire Light Infantry soldier of World War I CWGC Casualty Record. and the clock on the south wall of the tower was given as a memorial to parish men who died in the same war.

It is one of the larger 18th century establishments in the village.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22878#s9 It now serves as a local pub, hotel and restaurant. Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway The Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway once ran to the village and during (and for a period after) the Second World War there was a major military armaments depot near the village because of the village's remote, rural location and the railway link. The light railway was built 1907–1908, with its purpose being to carry stone from Abdon Burf quarry. It was under operation of the Great Western Railway, and ran from Ditton Priors to Cleobury Mortimer. From there, it joined the line from Bewdley to Tenbury Wells. A passenger service operated for thirty years between 1908 and 1938. The line served the Royal Naval Armaments Depot, which was located near the village and was in operation between 1939 and 1965.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22878 Archaeological finds There have been archaeological finds in close proximity to Ditton Priors.

The data is available for public use and distribution and is carried out every 10 years.http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html In 1831, the structure of social class was very different. A high percentage of the population were labourers/servants, and middling sorts, while a very low percentage of the population were employers or professionals.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_SOC&data;_cube=N_SOC1831&u;_id=10352484&c;_id=10001043&add;=Y By looking at historical occupation data, males dominate the majority of the occupation types in comparison to females, which is not uncommon for the period of time that the census data was taken. A large percentage of females, however, worked in domestic offices and services, but a very small proportion worked in agriculture or as a professional. 1881 Historical Occupation Graphhttp://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_IND&data;_cube=N_OCC_ORDER1881&u;_id=10352484&c;_id=10001043&add;=Y Neighbourhood statistics When looking at neighbourhood statistics, the settlement of Ditton Priors falls into the neighbourhood of Bridgnorth (007A).

It was a well used hall and the venue to activities such as \\"The Harvest Supper\\", Miss British Legion Dance, Young Farmers Club meetings and variety shows including \\"Twenty Questions\\" and many amateur plays.http://www.dittonpriors.com/amenities/village-hall-community-centre/ A large amount of money was needed to renovate the building and modernise it, adding toilets, heating and a car park, which unfortunately, was never raised. The village hall moved into the Old Royal Naval Armaments Depot canteen, which had closed down after several years of use. The villagers bought the building and converted it into a village hall during the 1970s. It housed the village hall activities until the early 1990s, when a new village hall was proposed. The new building was completed in 1998 and contains a bar and lounge, with a committee meeting and a kitchen, which is fully equipped.

The nearest rail station is approximately 9.9 miles away. The nearest airport is Birmingham Airport, which is approximately 35.8 miles away. Climate Ditton Priors, located within the region of The Midlands, is at the geographical heart of England, giving it a mixture of climatical characteristics. It acts as a transitional area between the northern and southern parts of England when regarding temperature, and between Wales and the East of England when regarding rainfall. As with much of the United Kingdom, the coldest month is January, while the warmest month is July. Altitude affects average temperature results, with the Severn Valley to the south and the Peak District to the north of The Midlands contributing to the average climate figures for the region.

The complex has been redeveloped since then, and the current buildings on the site date from 1986. In December 2004, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that Standford Hill was not effective as a resettlement prison, and did not offer inmates worthwhile skills. The report also criticised the activities offered to prisoners. However inspectors did find \\"'significant' progress had been made in safety and respect\\" at the prison. Another inspection took place in December 2011 which found that outcomes were reasonable in most areas, yet there were still some significant areas of concern.

Physical Characteristics Location of Canal des Ardennes in relation to the other waterways of northeast France (from the European Waterways Map and Directory by David Edwards-May, 5th ed., publ. Transmanche, 2014) The Canal des Ardennes is 87.779 km long and has 44 locks (37 on the Aisne side and 7 on the Meuse side) with a tunnel in Saint-Aignan. As originally built it was 5.5 km longer, entering the Aisne further downstream, but this section was bypassed by the Canal latéral à l'Aisne in 1841. The canal connects the village of Pont-à-Bar (in the commune of Dom-le-Mesnil) to the junction with the lateral canal downstream of Vieux-lès-Asfeld. The first part of the canal is 39 km long and crosses the threshold between the valleys of the Meuse and the Aisne by following the Bar Valley, with a short cut through a tunnel at Saint-Aignan. This section of the canal up to the summit level is supplied with water from the Lac de Bairon, with water pumped from the Meuse. After the summit is reached the canal quickly drops down to the Aisne through a series of 27 locks in just 9 km. From Semuy the canal closely follows the course of the Aisne. In places it even follows the old winding river bed, but mostly runs straight through new cuts. On the Aisne side the canal is fed directly by the river Aisne through diversion weirs at Vouziers, Rilly, Givry, Biermes, and Asfeld. On the Aisne side the Vouziers Branch, 12.066 kilometres long, rises 9 m (following the course of the river Aisne) through 4 locks to the town of Vouziers. The canal has two separate sections and two series of locks, as if it were made up of two distinct canals. The first is the portion from the Meuse to the Aisne river at the junction with the Vouziers Branch (Pont-à- Bar to Semuy, 39 km). The second is the entire length parallel to the Aisne beginning at Vouziers and continuing parallel to the Aisne to Vieux-lès-Asfeld (61 km). *Altitude at Vieux-lès-Asfeld: 60.55 metres. *Altitude at Pont-à-Bar: 151.30 metres. *Altitude at the summit level: 165 metres. *Average lock height: 2.68 metres. Aisne side: 2.70 metres. Meuse side: 2.57 metres. History The Canal des Ardennes at Pont-a-Bar The first canal projects in the region date from 1684 under the Louvois ministry and consisted of using and extending the course of the Bar which was then navigable. Various proposals were made over the decades and, in letters patent of June 1776 – almost a century later – the Prince of Conti was granted the privilege of its construction and operation. The prince died shortly after and nothing was done. After the French Revolution of 1789 the National Constituent Assembly relaunched the project but found fault with previous studies and the project did not proceed.Ernest Grangez, Precise History and Statistics of navigable waterways in France and parts of Belgium, Imprimerie centrale de Napoléon Chaix & Cie, 1855, 796 pages, p. 45 In \\"Year VIII\\" (1800), the local general councilors reminded the government of the project. The prefect Joseph Frain supported and argues for the canal, on the basis of a new route, in a report on 4 October 1800 to the Interior Minister, Lucien Bonaparte. The subsequent Interior Minister, the scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal, agreed to undertake construction but granted only very limited funds. Work began slowlyGilles Demuth and Jean Tulard (preface), Ardennes under the First Empire: Prefect Frain (1800-1814), Revue Historique Ardennaise, Vol. XVII, 1982, pp. 133-248 It became more important during the Bourbon Restoration with the launch in 1820 of a loan to finance the project. The opening of the canal took place between 1827 and 1835 with modernization between 1842 and 1846.Un canal...des canaux, CNMH & Picard editor, 1986. The Vouziers Branch was opened to shipping in 1836. For the part parallel to the Aisner downstream of Lock No. 26 at Rilly initially, until the dams were built, these parts of the navigable canal were connected by a series of artificial reaches. From 1842 to 1845 improvements were being made, in particular through the creation of the reservoir and the artificial Lake Bairon. =Appearance of a Weed= The plant Matricaria discoidea (Pineapple weed, wild Chamomile), a native of North America, appeared in 1861 along the Canal des Ardennes and then from 1880 to 1895 in the North of France. It spread so rapidly that it displaced the native Tripleurospermum inodorum \\"to seem as native as he\\".Gustave Malcuit, Contributions to the phyto-sociological study of southern Vosges saônoises, plant associations of the Lanterne Valley, Doctoral thesis, Soc. d'édit. du Nord, 1929, p. 188 Alfred Giard, On a fast-spreading weed (Matricaria discoidea D. C), in the Feuille des jeunes naturalistes, vol. 31-33, 1900-1903, p. 188 states: \\"The Catalogue of Vascular Plants of Ardennes (Charleville, 1900), a posthumous work by Albert Callay, tells us (p. 249) that M. discoidea was seen in June 1861 by Bouffray on the Canal des Ardennes dike near the Rilly Lock. At that time the plant was not reported by Reichenbach except around the village of Schoeneberg near Berlin. Callay guessed that the Ardennes location, where the plant had also not previously been seen, came from seeds mixed in cereal made for the Rilly mill.\\" Ports *The most important port is Rethel *There are Marinas or stops in: Rethel, Attigny, Semuy, Vouziers, and Le Chesne Canel des Ardennes Picture Gallery File:Canal des Ardennes Ecluse 4 Saint-Aignan.jpgLock 4 near the tunnel File:Canal des Ardennes Ecluse 5 Saint-Aignan.jpgLock 5 at Saint- Aignan File:Canal des Ardennes à Omicourt.JPGThe Canal at Omicourt File:Canal des Ardennes pres de Vendresse (Fr).jpgThe Canal at Vendresse File:Malmy (Ardennes) et les crues de la Bar (janvier 2012).JPGThe Canal at Malmy File:Ambly-sur-Bar-FR-08-pont du canal-02.jpgA bridge at Ambly-sur-Bar File:Canal des Ardennes à La Cassine.jpgThe Canal at La Cassine File:Le Chesne (Ardennes, Fr), church and Canal des Ardennes.JPGThe Canal at Le Chesne File:Montgon-08-écluses-04.jpg Lock at Montgon File:Canal des Ardennes, Vallée des écluses,.JPGThe \\"Valley of Locks\\" File:Semuy-FR-08-canal de Vouziers-02.jpgThe Canal at Semuy File:Canal de Vouziers à Vrizy (Ardennes, Fr).JPGThe Canal de Vouziers at Vrizy File:Rilly-aux-Oies- FR-08-Saint-Irénée-canal des Ardennes-01.jpgThe locks at Rilly File:Attigny port Canal des Ardennes.JPGAttigny Port File:Attigny-FR-08-canal des Ardennes-08.JPGThe Canal at Attigny File:Ambly-Fleury (Ardennes) city limit sign and bridge Canal des Ardennes.JPGThe bridge over the canal at Ambly- Fleury File:Thugny-Trugny, Canal des Ardennes écluse nr 8 (04 bateau en écluse eau haute).JPGLock 8 at Thugny-Trugny File:Thugny-Trugny- FR-08-écluse-01.jpgLock 1 at Thugny-Trugny File:Aire (Ardennes) Canal des Ardennes.JPGThe Canal at Aire File:Vieux-lès-Asfeld (Ardennes) Canal des Ardennes, écluse.JPGLock at Vieux-les-Asfeld Images of Detailed Maps of the Canal File:Canal des Ardennes - de Château-Porcien à l'Aisne.jpgCanal des Ardennes: Château-Porcien to Brienne-sur-Aisne File:Canal des Ardennes - section Rethel.jpgCanal des Ardennes: Biermes to Nanteuil-sur-Aisne File:Canal des Ardennes - de Neuville-Day à Thugny.jpgCanal des Ardennes: Neuville-Day to Thugny-Trugny File:Canal de Vouziers.jpgCanal de Vouziers File:Canal des Ardennes - bief du Chesne.jpgCanal des Ardennes: Summit level (Le Chesne & Bairon) to Semuy File:Canal des Ardennes - versant Meuse.jpgCanal des Ardennes: Northern side towards the Meuse Sources By date of Publication *J.

James Oglethorpe first built on Cumberland Island in 1736, building a hunting lodge that he named Dungeness. Oglethorpe named the place after Dungeness, in England. The next Dungeness was the legacy of Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene, who had acquired of island land in exchange for a bad debt. In 1803, his widow Catharine Littlefield Greene built a four-story tabby mansion over a Timucuan shell mound. During the War of 1812 the island was occupied by the British, who used the house as a headquarters. Greene Cottage or Tabby House Dungeness Ruins In 1818 Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee, a cavalry commander during the Revolutionary War and father of Robert E. Lee, stayed at the house until his death on March 25, 1818, cared for by Greene's daughter Louisa, and was laid to rest in nearby cemetery with full military honors provided by an American fleet stationed at St. Marys, Georgia.William W. Winn. Private Fastness: Tales Of Wild, American Heritage, April 1972, Volume 23, Issue 3. The house was abandoned during the U.S. Civil War and burned in 1866. In the 1880s the property was purchased by Thomas M. Carnegie, brother of Andrew Carnegie, who began to build a new mansion on the site. The 59-room Queen Anne style mansion and grounds were completed after Carnegie's death in 1886. His wife Lucy continued to live at Dungeness and built other estates for her children, including Greyfield for Margaret Carnegie, Plum Orchard for George Lauder Carnegie, and Stafford Plantation. By this time, the Carnegies owned 90% of the island. The Carnegies moved out of Dungeness in 1925. In 1959 the Dungeness mansion was destroyed by fire, alleged to be arson. The ruins are today preserved by the National Park Service as part of Cumberland Island National Seashore. They were acquired by the Park Service in 1972. The main house comprises a portion of the larger historic district, which includes servant's quarters, utility buildings, laundries, cisterns, and a variety of other structures. The district forms a planned, landscaped ensemble. The most significant supporting structure is the Tabby House or Nathanael Greene Cottage, which dates to the Greene family's tenure.

Biography =Military career= Of Sicilian descent but born in Prato he was the son of a military man. His career in the Army was rapid and brilliant. In the First World War he was Captain of Artillery. In 1941, he was promoted to brigadier general during the Invasion of Yugoslavia, and was at that time, the youngest general in Italy. In 1942 he was called to the Army General Staff and the following year, to the High Command and collaborated as personal aide with General Vittorio Ambrosio. He was a close friend of Benito Mussolini's son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano, who was the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Ciano was involved in ousting Mussolini in July 1943 after the Allied invasion of Sicily. Castellano sided with Ciano and had a prominent role in the events that led up to the fall of the fascist regime. He organised the arrest of Mussolini. =Armistice with the Allied armed forces= Castellano (in civilian attire) shakes hands with Dwight Eisenhower after the signing of the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in Cassibile on September 8, 1943 The new Prime Minister, Pietro Badoglio, sent Castellano to Lisbon in order to contact Allied diplomats to set the conditions for the surrender of Italy. He ordered Castellano to insist that any surrender of Italy was subject to a landing of Allied troops on the Italian mainland (the Allies at this point were holding Sicily and some minor islands). Badoglio also dared to ask for access to Allied military plans, which was not accepted.Agarossi, A Nation Collapses, pp. 73-81 After complicated negotiations the government and king accepted the conditions for the armistice. On September 3, 1943, Castellano, in lieu of Badoglio, and General Walter Bedell Smith, in place of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, signed the armistice agreement in the town of Cassibile, near Syracuse, in Sicily.

The general believed that law and order could be restored if \\"the system formerly employed by the old and respected Maf(f)ia should return to the Sicilian scene.\\"Finkelstein, Separatism, the Allies and the Mafia, p. 120 Castellano made contacts with Mafia leaders and met with them several times. He gained the cooperation of Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini, who had supported separatism but was now prepared for a change in the island’s political situation. Together with Vizzini, he approached Trapani politician Virgilio Nasi to offer him the leadership of a movement for Sicilian autonomy with the support of the Mafia. The plan was to stage Nasi as a candidate for High Commissioner for Sicily to oppose the favourite, the Christian Democrat Salvatore Aldisio. Il generale amico di don Calò Vizzini , La Sicilia, September 10, 2003 Il nodo siciliano, from the 2002 final report of the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism in Italy (Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi). Castellano’s initiative weakened the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano, MIS) of Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile. The Mafia, however, became a force of order and stability on the island and prevented a separatist overthrow by stifling extremist elements in the movement. The seeds were planted from which the Mafia would tremendously benefit in the decades to come.Finkelstein, Separatism, the Allies and the Mafia, p. 125 =Retirement and death= He wrote a number of books about his experiences during the War: Come firmai l'armistizio di Cassabile (How I signed the armistice in Cassabile), published by Mondadori in 1945; La guerra continua (The continuous war); and Roma Kaputt. In 1947, he retired from the Army and became the director of a chain of hotels and thermal baths for some years. He died in Porretta Terme on July 31, 1977. References * Agarossi, Elena (2000).

He was the eldest son of Louis I the Fair, Duke of Brzeg by his wife Agnes, daughter of Henry IV of Głogów- Żagań. The death of his younger brother Wenceslaus in 1358 left him as the only male heir of his father. In the almost contemporary \\"Kronice Legnickiej\\" Henry VII was assigned the term \\"z Blizną\\" (with a scar), which was adopted later by historians as a nickname. This term was maybe the result of the wounds on his face obtained under unknown circumstances (ca. 1373), where apparently he was near to death. Life Henry VII's first official appearance was only in 1358, and despite he being of age to assume government affairs, it wasn't until 1395 (when he was more than fifty years old!), when he received his own district, Niemcza (in fact, he had already obtained in 1382 the right to buy this district from the King Wenceslaus IV, but the formal purchase was made only ten years later, in 1392). The reason for this decision was the policy of Louis I the Fair, who didn't want to make further divisions of the already small Duchy of Brzeg. Instead, since 1360 or 1361 Henry VII was named by his father as co-regent, but without any formal power. He didn't make any protests to his father or claim a separated land for himself, a fact which was very unusual, if other Piast Duchies are considered. In 1365 Henry VII, together with his cousin Rupert I took part in the expedition of Emperor Charles IV to Provence, during which he visited, among others, the city of Avignon, where he tried to obtain a Prebendary from his family. Louis I the Fair died on 6/23 December 1398 and Henry VII finally received the long-awaited Duchy of Brzeg as a sole ruler. However, he died unexpectedly eight months later, on 11 July 1399. Marriages and Issue By 1369, Henry VII married firstly Helena (d. 19 June 1369), daughter of Otto V, Count of Orlamünde. They had one son: #Henry IX (b. 1369 - d. 9 January 1419/10 July 1420). In July 1379, Henry VII married secondly Margareta (b. bef. 1358 - d. ca. 14 May 1388), daughter of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia and widow of Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania. They had two children: #Margareta (b. 1380/84 - d. aft. 2 October 1408); she was betrothed to Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Bohemia, Hungary and later Holy Roman Emperor, but the wedding never took place. #Louis II (b. 1380/85 - d. 30 May 1436).

He was nicknamed the \\"Monster of Pont-Rouge\\". Crimes His first sexual assault, which also involved an attempted murder, was against a young woman from Pont-Rouge. Léopold Dion and his brother raped and stabbed the woman on the railway track linking the Rang Petit-Capsa (a street) to the village of Pont-Rouge. They left her for dead, but she survived, albeit with both physical and psychological injuries. Dion sexually abused 21 boys, killing four. He lured his victims by posing as a photographer. His first murder victim was 12-year-old Guy Luckenuck, in Quebec City that day for clarinet lessons. This boy came from Kénogami. They travelled together every week to take music lessons at the Conservatoire de Musique du Québec in Québec City. Dion lured the boy by taking a series of snapshots with an old camera that had no film before claiming to want to continue elsewhere. He drove the boy into the country, where, in a remote spot, Dion then strangled him, and then buried him.http://www2.canoe.com/cgi-bin/imprimer.cgi?id=127221 Réseau Canoë On 5 May 1963, Dion crossed paths with eight-year-old Alain Carrier and 10-year-old Michel Morel. He used the same ploy to lure them into his car, driving them to a run-down building in Saint-Raymond-de-Portneuf. With Alain, he pretended to play prisoner so that he could tie the boy up in the cottage. Once the younger boy had been overcome, Dion turned to the older one, Michel, whom he led outside, whereupon he asked the child to take his clothes off. Dion then strangled him with a garrote, before going back inside and smothering the other boy. On 26 May 1963, he met 13-year-old Pierre Marquis, who was also taken in by the fake photographer’s promises. They were a couple of paces from a dune, the same one that had become Guy Luckenuck’s grave a bit more than a month earlier. Once again, Dion asked his victim to pose naked. The child complied, but when Dion tried to assault him, he fought back before succumbing to the assault. Dion strangled Marquis. Arrest Dion, who was then on conditional release for raping a schoolteacher several years earlier, was arrested the day after his last murder. It was a description of Dion from another boy whom he had waylaid, but who had gotten away from him, that led to the police apprehending Dion. Once in prison, Dion held out for a month before he finally admitted to his crimes in detail to his interrogators. He then led investigators to the spot where he had buried the children's bodies. Trial Criminal lawyer Guy Bertrand defended Dion at his trial. Dion was, in the end, charged with only one murder, Pierre Marquis', due to a lack of evidence in the other cases. On 10 April 1964, Judge Gérard Lacroix sentenced him to be hanged. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by then Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier after Bertrand's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in the matter had failed. Guy Bertrand's own account Death On 17 November 1972, Dion was stabbed to death by a fellow inmate named Normand \\"Lawrence d'Arabie\\" Champagne, who was later found not guilty of this crime by reason of insanity.http://www.erudit.org/revue/crimino/1976/v9/n1-2/017057ar.pdf \\"Littérature carcérale québécoise\\", issue of \\"Érudit\\" References 1920 births 1972 deaths Canadian serial killers Male serial killers Canadian rapists Rape of males Canadian people convicted of murder People convicted of murder by Canada Canadian prisoners sentenced to death Prisoners sentenced to death by Canada Canadian murder victims Serial killers murdered in prison custody People murdered in Quebec Deaths by stabbing in Canada Incidents of violence against boys Canadian people who died in prison custody Prisoners who died in Canadian detention 1960s murders in Canada 1963 crimes in Canada 1963 murders in North America 1970s murders in Canada 1972 crimes in Canada 1972 murders in North America violence against children ","title":"Léopold Dion"},{"id":"21098794","text":"Anita Roy (also Strong) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, played by Saira Choudhry. Choudhry was cast in 2008 as part of the new Roy family and arrived in November and stayed in the serial for 2 years before she left Hollyoaks on 20 January 2011. Her more notable storylines include being racially bullied, which was nominated for an award at the Inside Soap Awards and which led to her self-harming storyline. In her time on the show she also discovered that she is adopted and began an on-line relationship. Anita also suffered an identity crisis. Character development =Characterisation= E4 described Anita as \\"sensitive soul\\". Colin Daniels of Digital Spy branded her a \\"troubled teen\\". In an interview Choudry labelled the character \\"disturbing\\" and commented that \\"She's not so self-absorbed and she's turned into a young adult now.\\" On her favourite storyline she also added that it was \\"probably the story where Anita tried to bleach her skin.\\" because of how challenging it was to her and because she was most proud of it. E4 also said the character was originally \\"a shy young teenager, who found it hard make friends because her Dad happened to be head of the school.\\" The Daily Star labelled her a \\"honey\\". =Self-harming= Anita's first major storyline started in late 2008, when Lauren Valentine and Barry Newton used her so they could be together in secret, this led to Anita feeling secluded from their group. Anita tried to dress like Newt and Lauren, however Leila Roy told her to be herself. She then began a friendship with Theresa McQueen. After Lauren and Newt split up, Anita and Newt began a relationship. Lauren was jealous and began to make people think Anita was bullying her.

She then put a picture of Theresa on a social networking website and pretended to be her, when Theresa found out, she called her a freak. Local bully Gaz Bennett approached Anita and began racially bullying her. Anita, in order to become white, began rubbing bleach onto her skin. When Choudry found out about the storyline, she was \\"quite surprised\\". She said the nature of the story was controversial and she felt shocked at some of things Gaz does to Anita. Choudry was not certain Hollyoaks had ever aired such \\"dark scenes\\" of racism before. The storyline gave Choudry a chance to \\"do something new\\" as she had previously been filming \\"normal school scenes.\\" Speaking on the opportunity to portray the storyline, she added: \\"I just felt really glad to be given the chance to do something like this - it was a big challenge.\\" The Daily Star called the storyline \\"one of the show’s most controversial plotlines\\" and \\"shocking.\\" Storylines =Backstory= Anita was born to a teenage mother named Eva Strong.

Established in 1996 following an intergovernmental agreement between France and Lebanon, it is managed by the Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The faculty is composed of professors from Europe, particularly from ESCP Europe and HEC Paris.  History  The École Supérieure des Affaires was established in 1996. The idea behind creating an important business school in Beirut came from, and was promoted—in particular towards the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry—by Fayek Abillama, who was also the President of the Alumni Association at HEC, Lebanon. At the same time, Jean-Pierre Lafon, former French Ambassador to Lebanon, convinced of the necessity of increasing Franco-Lebanese cooperation in matters of education, adopted the idea of creating a Business School to address the needs of the business community. In May 1995, he approached the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry to set his plan in motion, in close collaboration with The Central Bank of Lebanon and its Governor, Riad Salame. A partnership was thereafter established between the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Central Bank of Lebanon, and the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ESA was established on 5 April 1996, in the presence of French President Jacques Chirac and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, through an intergovernmental agreement signed between France and Lebanon, and an institutional agreement signed between The Central Bank of Lebanon and the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ESA was recognized by the Lebanese Ministry of Higher Education decree N8 9033 dated 27 August 1996.  Campus  The \\"Villa Rose\\" (pink villa), is a historical 19th century mansion. Built by industrialists Antoine- Fortuné and Nicolas Portalis (sons of French statesman Jean-Étienne Portalis) who founded a sericulture and silk production facility in the Shouf region in 1836. The Portalis heirs sold the mansion in the early 20th century to the French mandate authorities. The \\"Villa Rose\\" is still owned by the French government, it had accommodated since the 1930s the counselor of the embassy of France in Lebanon. The \\"Villa Rose\\" and its gardens have been abandoned and ravaged during the Lebanese civil war. The ESA recently acquired the \\"Villa Rose\\" from the French government according to a long-term lease. The ESA is restoring the \\"Villa Rose\\" in preparation of future expansion and integration into the campus, meanwhile the Portalis mansion is used by ESA to house regular cultural events and painting expositions.  Academics  = Faculty = The Ecole Supérieure des Affaires hosts approximately 250 visiting international leading academics and professors most of which come from the two centres of Business Higher Education of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry: ESCP Europe and HEC group. The ESA is headed by Stéphane Attali who had been the deputy director general of ESCP Europe; Attali replaced Roger Ourset and assumed office in January 2009. According to the WBS 2010 ranking, after 14 years of existence, the ESA scored first in the MENA region amongst more than 50 other establishments. Highly selective, the Ecole Supérieure des Affaires has today acquired a great prestige, competing French and English best business schools. = Academic cooperation = * ESCP Europe (École supérieure de commerce de Paris–École européenne des affaires) * Institut d'Administration des Entreprises at Poitiers * École supérieure de commerce de Rouen * HEC Lausanne * Groupe HEC paris * Paris Diderot University * Reims Management School * Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi * Universita Ca' Foscari Venezia * Skema Business School * Rotterdam School of Management = Admissions = The selection criteria rest mainly on competitive written and oral exams.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 25 November 2008. Goonan took a break from filming during 2010, and returned on-screen on 19 January 2011. Goonan announced his permanent departure from Hollyoaks in October 2011. He made his final appearance on 11 November 2011. Character development Goonan took a short break from filming during 2010, returning to filming in winter. A spokesperson described the scenes stating: \\"Much to Anita's concern, Gaz will be making a shocking return to the village in the weeks ahead.\\" His return scenes aired in January 2011. Gaz is introduced as the leader of a racist hoodie gang. Gaz has already shown his hatred of black, Asian and bisexual characters including Ash Roy (Junade Khan), Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry), Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal), Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson) and Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). Despite his \\"hard\\" personality, Gaz is seen to be vulnerable when Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley) beats him up while he was on his own. Gaz got his comeuppance in the media dubbed 'Super September', in which Gaz was attacked and left in a coma. Viewers of Hollyoaks asked Joel Goonan on the official website why he thinks Gaz is bullying Anita. Goonan replied: \\"I don't actually know! I don't think Gaz has actually got that many friends — he's got people who follow him, but he hasn't got many friends. He's quite disturbed really. I don't think it's necessarily to do with Anita being Asian or anything like that, I think it's just the fact that she's really vulnerable and Gaz knows he can take advantage of her at any time. It's nothing to do with her skin colour, its about Gaz seeing her as a really weak person. He knows he can bully her and she'll be too scared to do anything back to him.\\" Goonan was also asked if he found portraying an \\"evil\\" character difficult. Replying to this, he said: \\"Not really. Well I wasn't like that in school or anything, I've never been a bully. But I've grown up in quite a rough part of Manchester so I've been surrounded by people like that since I've been in school. So it was quite easy to portray that type of character because I've been around those kind of people for years. I've sort of found myself mimicking people I used to know.\\" In October 2011, Goonan announced that he had finished filming with the serial. Storylines Gaz first appears as a student at Hollyoaks High School, and he begins work experience at take-away Relish. His work experience turns out bad as he turns up late, does no work and is racist towards Anita, Lauren, Calvin and Ash, which ends up with him being sacked by Ash. At school, local Police Community Support Officer Carmel McQueen (Gemma Merna) opens a police stall. Gaz and his gang turn up a heater, causing Carmel to sweat and take her jacket off. They then give her a lollipop, which she begins to eat, before taking a picture on a mobile phone of her. This phone is then confiscated by Russ Owen (Stuart Manning). The gang later spray-paint a picture of Carmel on the skate ramps, but are interrupted by Calvin, who Gaz is then racist towards. Gaz and his gang steal Relish's week's takings from Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), also beating him up. Zak attacks Gaz, who is scared without his gang. Gilly refuses to acknowledge that it was Gaz who stole the takings. Feeling embarrassed, Gilly tells Ash and Calvin that the man who mugged him was 'huge'. Zak confronts Gaz, but loses his temper and punches him. Zak is cautioned by the police. Gaz and his gang then beat up Gilly, who does not file a complaint. Gaz starts harassing Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), and is warned off by Russ, Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) and Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). Gaz tempts former drug-addict Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) into smoking cannabis. However, she refuses. Gaz yet again harasses Zak and Ash, after Zak throws his football away. His football apparently bursts, caused by Zak, Gaz asks for food from Relish as compensation. Zak puts laxatives in curry sauce and gives it to him, before watching as Gaz has an accident. It is later discovered by Ash and Zak that Gaz used his faeces to paint \\"Paki Lover\\" on the front of Relish. The following day, after being threatened by Ash, Gaz decides to make peace. Zak tells him to leave, not accepting his apology. Gaz then begins beating himself up, making it look like it is Zak and Ash. The pair are then arrested for assault. As revenge on Ash, Gaz sets fire to Relish. He is then expelled from school after his racist bullying of Anita. Gaz is not seen again until April, when he apologises to Anita, telling her he has changed. He then helps Anita after she is threatened by her enemy, Lauren. After convincing her to meet him, Gaz's gang appear and hold Anita down as Gaz pours white paint over her, recording it on a mobile phone in the process. The next day, Anita tells her older brothers Ash and Ravi, they trick Gaz before beating him up. Gaz returns to school drunk to see Anita. He locks his former teacher Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) in a classroom and tries to assault her. However, Russ saves her. Gaz mugs Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) after being kicked out of his home. When Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) finds this out, he threatens him because Mercedes was looking after his son Lucas Hay, who could have been injured. He then begins sleeping in the school, where Barry Newton (Nico Mirallegro), Anita and Lauren find him. After filming Newt and Anita kissing, Gaz follows them to a secluded cottage, where he pressures Anita into sex. Anita spikes his drink with peanuts, due to his allergy. Newt attacks him as Anita escapes. Gaz follows, chasing Anita. Gaz decides to rape Anita whilst filming it on his mobile. Anita grabs a rock and hits Gaz over the head. Gaz then falls into a coma and later pretends to suffer from amnesia as to what had happened. After being released from hospital, Gaz asks Anita and Ricky Campbell (Ashley Margolis) if they know who attacked him. Anita tells him she would not help him and that she does not know who it was. The group consisting of Anita, Newt, Ricky, Lauren and Theresa stop being friends after the attack. Lauren pretends to befriend Gaz and pours tomato soup over him, as revenge for his racist attack on Anita. In the following weeks Gaz and Lauren become closer and begin a relationship however Gaz uses her to humiliate Anita. Gaz's relationship develops even further and they both plan to steal Spencer Gray's (Darren John Langford) inheritance. However, their plan starts to scupper when as Gaz watches Lauren lie to Spencer that she is pregnant with his child, Spencer panics and starts telling Sasha about the situation. Everyone is starting to believe that Gaz is the father, unaware that Lauren had made the whole thing up. Gaz and Lauren intended to secretly leave Hollyoaks on Calvin and Carmel's wedding day, however this was halted when Calvin is shot dead by Theresa, who is pregnant with Calvin's child. However, Lauren changes her mind after she lied to Sasha and Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell) that she had a miscarriage and runs away with Gaz; however, when they realise that they cannot cope without any money, they return to the village to hatch another plan, that Gaz should leave on his own and return to Lauren with some money. However, when they are in an alleyway near The Loft, they are ambushed by the police, who believed that Gaz is Calvin's murderer. Lauren and Gaz later break up when she reconciles with Anita. Anita then accuses him of spraying racist graffiti at Relish. As revenge he was intentionally wrongly advised by teacher Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan) to confront Anita. Gaz follows Des' advice and takes Theresa's mobile phone and texts Anita to meet in the woods. She agrees to meet but he holds her hostage. However, when Gaz looks into his bag, he finds a gun that Anita had found earlier, planted by Jacqui. As he stood in shock, holding the gun; the police arrive and they arrest him. He is then subsequently charged with the murder of Calvin as the gun he was holding was actually used to shoot Calvin. He is also charged with holding the gun to harm Anita. He was transferred to prison. Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) then interviewed him for an article about Des being a racist. During this scene, Michaela told Gaz about Lauren falling down the stairs at The Loft and having a blood clot. He got angry and thought she was making it up. His final scene was when Lauren visited him in prison. He assumed that she supported him and that she still loved him, but when Lauren gets strangely quiet he soon realised that she doesn't. He got angry and frustrated and she seemed careless. She walked away and leaves him, leading prison guards to restrain him when he was about to get out of control. This made him shout across the room to Lauren saying that he doesn't need her help and support anyway, leaving him slightly heartbroken. Gaz returns in 2011 and threatens Anita before she leaves Hollyoaks. He later gets a job in The Dog in the Pond pub by owner Heidi Costello and later finds her upset where they end up kissing. Later that month, while helping Rae take her belongings in to the flat he finds a drug stash which is Doug Carter's and later becomes involved with drug dealing by working for Brendan Brady. In October 2011, he began a relationship with Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis), he later attempts to kiss Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman), so she warns Sinead about Gaz but Sinead doesn't believe her and they both leave after getting a job offer. Sinead's ex- boyfriend Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) tracks them both down and declares his love for Sinead at a gig. Bart and Sinead later kiss and Gaz looks on. This is Gaz's last appearance as he goes travelling with the band alone. Reception Grace Dent of The Guardian joked about one of Gaz's light hearted storylines which featured after tragic storylines stating: \\"cruel, skint January has been brightened with a lawnmower race featuring Gaz and Lauren astride killer- bladed mowers, larking about like people who'd clearly forgotten they were stalked habitually by bad luck and tragedy.\\" References External links * Character profile on the E4 website Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2008 Male characters in television Fictional criminals on soap operas Fictional salespeople ","title":"Gaz Bennett"},{"id":"21098889","text":"is a Japanese shōnen baseball manga series written and illustrated by Yuji Terajima.

A former director of the Italian state-owned TV channel Rai Uno's news program TG1, Vespa is the founding host of the program Porta a Porta (English:\\"Door to door\\"), which has been broadcast without interruption on RAI channels since 1996. Vespa was born in L'Aquila, Abruzzo. He is married to Augusta Iannini, who is a judge.  Biography  = Journalism = Vespa began working with the local press in his native Abruzzo at a relatively young age, authoring sports articles for the L'Aquila branch of the newspaper Il Tempo when he was sixteen years old. In 1962 he became a radio announcer on RAI broadcasts and, after obtaining his LL.B. in 1968, began hosting the daily newscast Telegiornale RAI (afterwards renamed TG1). During the 1970s and 1980s, he undertook several controversial and ground-breaking projects, mainly as a foreign correspondent for RAI, interviewing many soon-to-be-influential personalities of the decades (for example, Vespa interviewed then-Cardinal Karol Wojtyła in 1977, a full year before his election to the pontificate). In 1977 he co-hosted, with Arrigo Petacco, the news program Tam Tam, moving the following year to a different format, precursor to that of Porta a Porta, where up-and-coming personalities and current events were discussed in front of a live studio audience, which participated to the exchange through Q&A; sessions (hence, the program was called Ping Pong). In June 1984 he was named \\"official commentator\\" for the live, televised broadcast of the State funeral for Enrico Berlinguer, who had been the leader of the Italian Communist Party. During the broadcast, he erroneously announced that Pietro Valpreda had been found guilty of the Piazza Fontana bombing, whereas he was a mere suspect, at the time—a mistake for which he publicly apologised on several occasions. Between 1989 and 1992, while he was the head newscaster for the RAI news program TG1, he came under attack for publicly declaring that he considered the ruling party Democrazia Cristiana his \\"editorial sounding board\\"; because RAI stations are state-owned and publicly funded, they are expected to be unbiased, which Vespa's words indicated not to be the case. In August 1990, when the Gulf War erupted, he supported the armed intervention in a much-criticised editorial that concluded that \\"War has been brought forth by the international community. And if we want to be members of that club, we must pay our dues.\\" Since 1996, Vespa has been at the helm of the news program Porta a Porta, where much of Italy's political debate takes place, so much so that it is sometimes sarcastically referred to as \\"the third house\\" (together with the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate) of the Parliament of Italy. On April 3, 2006 he moderated the second televised debate between then-Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi and the leader of the centre-left coalition Romano Prodi. In the same year, Vespa found himself at the centre of a political scandal after a telephone conversation he had with Salvatore Sottile, spokesperson for politician Gianfranco Fini, concerning an upcoming episode of Porta a Porta. During the (intercepted) conversation, Vespa indicated that he would \\"custom-tailor\\" the program to suit Fini's needs, requesting, in fact, that the politician's aide select the chosen adversary for the scheduled face-to-face. Since the program publicly prided itself on creating an unbiased turf for political confrontations, Vespa's integrity was called into question,http://www.repubblica.it/2006/06/sezioni/cronaca/vittorio- emanuele-2/petruccioli-scandalo-savoia/petruccioli-scandalo-savoia.html going as far as to be discredited, due to his perceived \\"servitude\\" towards right- wing politicians, especially Berlusconi, and a tendency of asking softball questions on most of his shows. This has led to some in the Italian media establishment calling Vespa a \\"regime servant\\", most famously by now-deceased journalist Giorgio Bocca. In February 2012 a photo of Italian troops who were killing Slovene civilians (as a retaliation because Tito's partizans murdered Italian soldiers) was shown by the host Vespa on TV as if being the other way round. When historian Alessandra Kersevan, who was a guest, pointed it out to Vespa that it is Slovenes on the photo who were killed and not vice versa, he did not apologize.

Historically, this subfamily has frequently been accorded family status. In some recent phylogenetic analyses, one of the subtribes within this group is the sister lineage to the superfamily Apoidea, and accorded family rank as Ammoplanidae along with Pemphredonidae and Psenidae so as to keep families monophyletic.Manuela Sann, Oliver Niehuis, Ralph S. Peters, Christoph Mayer, Alexey Kozlov, Lars Podsiadlowski, Sarah Bank, Karen Meusemann, Bernhard Misof, Christoph Bleidorn, and Michael Ohl (2018) Phylogenomic analysis of Apoidea sheds new light on the sister group of bees. BMC Evolutionary Biology 18:71. doi:10.1186/s12862-018-1155-8 The subfamily consists of solitary, parasitoidal wasps, each genus having its own distinct and consistent prey preferences. The adult females dig tunnels in the ground, or plant material, for nesting.Sharp, David (1901) \\"Insects Part II: Chapter III: Hymenoptera Aculeata continued: Family Sphegidae-Crabronides: Sub-Fam. 9. Mimesides.\\" in Harmer, S. F. and Shipley, A. E. (eds.) (1901) The Cambridge Natural History Macmillan and Co., London, p. 128 As with all other sphecoid wasps, the larvae are carnivorous; females hunt for prey on which to lay their eggs, mass provisioning the nest cells with paralyzed, living prey that the larvae feed upon after hatching from the egg. Subdivisions In most classifications, the Pemphredoninae are divided into four tribes: Entomosericini, Odontosphecini, Psenini, and Pemphredonini; the last of which has by far the largest number of species. The primary distinction between the Psenini and the Pemphredonini is that Psenini have a forewing with three submarginal cells, while Pemphredonini never have more than two submarginal cells in their forewing. More recent classifications treat Psenidae (including Odontosphecini) as a separate family, and sister to the newly-erected family Ammoplanidae, while Pemphredonidae (excluding Ammoplanina) is sister taxon to the Philanthidae. Fossils Two fossilized wasps from the Weald Clay, Archisphex and Angarosphex are considered to possibly be in the Pemphredoninae.Jarzembowski, E. A.

The Group's history stems from the founding in 1695 by the Parliament of Scotland of the Bank of Scotland, which is the fifth oldest bank in the United Kingdom. The Group's headquarters is located at 25 Gresham Street in the City of London and its registered office is on The Mound in Edinburgh. Lloyds Banking Group's activities are organised into: Retail Banking (including Mortgages and Sole Traders); Commercial; Life, Pensions & Insurance; and Wealth & International. Lloyds' has extensive overseas operations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Its headquarters for business in the European Union is in Berlin, Germany. Following the takeover, the Group stopped using the name HBOS publicly. The Halifax brand, products and pricing were discontinued in Scotland until it was re-established in 2013. The Halifax and Lloyds Bank brands are used in England and Wales and the Bank of Scotland and Halifax brand is used in Scotland, each offering different products and pricing. Lloyds Banking Group's CEO António Horta-Osório told The Banker, \\"We will keep the different brands because the customers are very different in terms of attitude\\".António Horta-Osório moves out of his comfort zone The Banker April 2011 Lloyds Banking Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately as of 4 March 2014the 7th-largest of any LSE company. and has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The group operates head office sites in London, Halifax, Leeds and Edinburgh.  History  =Origins= Lloyds Bank was one of the oldest banks in the UK, tracing its establishment to Taylors and Lloyds founded in 1765 in Birmingham by button maker John Taylor and iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd II. Through a series of mergers, Lloyds became one of the Big Four banks in the UK. Bank of Scotland, which originated in the 17th century, is the second-oldest surviving UK bank after the Bank of England. In 2001, a wave of consolidations in the UK banking market led the former Halifax Building Societywhich originated in 1853to agree to a £10.8 billion merger with Bank of Scotland. Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) can trace its roots back to the first savings bank founded by Henry Duncan in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, in 1810. TSB itself was created in 1985 by an Act of Parliament that merged all the remaining savings banks in England & Wales as TSB Bank plc and in Scotland (except Airdrie Savings Bank) as TSB Scotland plc.  Lloyds/TSB merger  Park Row Leeds branch of Lloyds Bank, with a sculpture of the black horse (called Cancara) in the foreground In 1995, Lloyds Bank merged with TSB, forming Lloyds TSB Group plc. In 2000, the group acquired Scottish Widows, a mutual life-assurance company based in Edinburgh, in a deal worth £7 billion. This made the group the second-largest UK provider of life assurance and pensions after Prudential. In September the same year, Lloyds TSB purchased Chartered Trust from Standard Chartered Bank for £627 million to form Lloyds TSB Asset Finance Division, which provides motor, retail and personal finance in the United Kingdom under the trading name Black Horse. Lloyds TSB continued to take part in the consolidation, making a takeover bid for Abbey National in 2001, which was later rejected by the Competition Commission. In October 2003, Lloyds TSB Group agreed on the sale of its subsidiary NBNZ Holdings Limitedcomprising the Group's New Zealand banking and insurance operationsto Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In July 2004, Lloyds TSB Group announced the sale of its business in Argentina to Banco Patagonia Sudameris S.A. and its business in Colombia to Primer Banco del Istmo, S.A.. On 20 December 2005, Lloyds TSB announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its credit card business Goldfish to Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited for £175 million. In 2007, Lloyds TSB announced that it had sold its Abbey Life insurance division to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.  Acquisition of HBOS  Head office of the Bank of Scotland at The Mound, Edinburgh. On 17 September 2008, the BBC reported that HBOS was in takeover talks with Lloyds TSB, in response to a precipitous drop in HBOS's share price. The talks concluded successfully that evening with a proposal to create a banking giant which would hold a third of UK mortgages. An announcement was made on 18 September 2008. On 19 November 2008, the new acquisition and government preference share purchase was agreed by Lloyds TSB shareholders. HBOS shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on 12 December. Lloyds TSB Group changed its name to Lloyds Banking Group upon completion of the takeover on 19 January 2009. On 12 February 2009, Eric Daniels, the CEO of the Group, was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons. One of the key issues concerned Lloyds' takeover of HBOS and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition. Daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company, but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition. Losses were slightly more than the £10 billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to write-offs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it. The then-Chairman of Lloyds, Sir Victor Blank, said in August 2009 that losses had been \\"at the worst end of expectations\\", and that the Lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losseswhich were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late 2008 and early 2009happened. This position was confirmed by Archie Kane, a senior Lloyds executive in Scotland, in evidence to the Scottish parliament's economy committee in December 2009. On 13 February 2009, Lloyds Banking Group said that the losses at HBOS were greater than had been anticipated, at around £10 billion. The share price of Lloyds Banking Group fell 32% on the London Stock Exchange, carrying other bank shares with it. =October 2008 to January 2009= The Aylesbury branch of Lloyds Bank, formerly the Bucks and Oxon Union Bank. On 13 October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced a government plan for the Treasury to invest £37 billion (, ) of new capital into major UK banksincluding Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOSto avert a collapse of the financial sector. Barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the UK Government by raising capital privately and HSBC moved capital to its UK business from its other businesses overseas. It was later confirmed that Lloyds TSB would have been required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over HBOS. After the recapitalisations and Lloyds' acquisition of HBOS, the UK Government held a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. =February to June 2009= In February 2009, after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated, the FSA was instructed to \\"stress test\\" the banks against a severe economic downturn. The FSA stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen, but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario. These assumptions included: * A peak-to-trough fall in UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of over 6%, with no growth until 2011 and returning to trend-rate growth in 2012; * A rise in UK unemployment to just over 12%; * A 50% peak-to-trough fall in UK house prices; * A 60% peak-to-trough fall in UK commercial property prices. The conclusion from this exercise was that Lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred. Because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time, in March 2009 Lloyds made a deal with the UK government consisting of two elements: * Redemption of Preference Shares. The £4 billion of preference (non-voting) shares held by UKFI were repaid on 8 June 2009 following the issue of new ordinary sharesthis avoided the payment of £480 million annual interest to the Treasury and allowed Lloyds to resume payment of dividends when profits allowed. These new ordinary shares were initially available to existing shareholders through an Open Offer at 38.43 pence that closed on 5 June 200987% were taken up. The remaining 13% were placed in the market on 8 June 2009 at 60 pence. This Open Offer and Placing was underwritten by the Treasury; if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market, the governmentas underwriters of the dealwould have bought them and their shareholding would have increased to a maximum of 65%. This did not happen; the government's holding remained at 43.4% and Lloyds became the first European bank to repay government \\"credit crunch\\" investment. Following the government's 43.4% participation in June's Open Offer, the average buying price of the government's total shareholding was 122.6 pence. * Asset Protection Scheme. Lloyds agreed in principle to enter the government's Asset Protection Scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loansprimarily on the old HBOS portfolio. The fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the government of new 'B' (non-voting) shares, which could have increased the government holding to a maximum of c.62%or higher if the government had bought all the ordinary shares issued to redeem the preference shares. =June 2009 to present= King Street Manchester branch of Lloyds Bank, designed by Charles Heathcote in 1915.Wyke, Terry Public Sculpture of Greater Manchester (p.88) Liverpool University Press, 2004Press, Susan Manchester – Lloyds TSB on King Street Manchester Evening News, 8 September 2003 Lloyds impairments peaked in the first half of 2009; by mid-2009 the Asset Protection Scheme increasingly looked like a poor deal for Lloyds. Following negotiations, the government confirmed on 3 November 2009 that Lloyds would not enter the schemealthough RBS still would. Instead, Lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders; as an existing 43.4% shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at 43.4%. Following this, the National Audit Office calculated the government's average buying price for its entire stake in Lloyds to be about 74 pence. It was announced in the Government's Pre-Budget Report on 9 December 2009 that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £50 billion to £10 billionin part because of the restructuring of the Government's Asset Protection Scheme.bbc.co.uk Key points: The pre-Budget report at-a- glance BBC News The final part of the December 2009 capital raise involved issuing new shares to debt holders in February 2010. This diluted existing shareholdersincluding the UK Government, whose shareholding was reduced from 43.4% to around 41%. According to the Accord trade union general secretary Ged Nichols, Lloyds Banking Group had cut 30,000 jobs between February 2009 and August 2011; and in August 2011 it announced another 1,300 job losses. The group sold its 70% stake in insurance company Esure to Esure Group Holdings on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around £185 million. On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Lloyds was considering selling its 60% stake in St James's Place Wealth Management to raise around £1 billion. In April 2013, Lloyds sold its loss-making Spanish retail operationoriginally Banco Halifax Hispaniaand the local investment management business in Spain to Banco de Sabadell. Lloyds will receive a 1.8% stake in Sabadell worth about €84 million and an additional sum of up to €20 million over the next five years. In September 2013, it was reported that the UK government was planning to sell up to a quarter of its shares in Lloyds Banking Group. The government sold 6% of its shares on 17 September 2013 at 75p, raising £3.2 billion and reducing its stake to 32.7%. The UK government then sold a further 7.8% on 26 March 2014 at 75.5p raising a further £4.2bn and reducing its stake to 24.9%. A trading plan of incremental sales during 2015 reduced the publicly owned stake to below 10% by the end of October. Sales resumed in November 2016, as the holding was reduced to 7.99%. On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold. =Divestment= The Edgbaston branch of Lloyds Bank at Five Ways, Birmingham, designed by P. B. Chatwin in 1908.Five Ways, Birmingham, in 1935 Birmingham City Council. Retrieved 27 November 2009 The UK Government's purchase of a 43.4% stake in the group in 2009 was considered as state aid; under European Commission competition laws, the group would be required to sell a portion of its business.Rights Issue and Capital Enhancement Proposals Presentations and Webcasts, Lloyds Banking Group, 3 November 2009 The group's divestment plancodenamed \\"Verde\\"identified 632 branches which would be transferred to a new business. Customers with accounts held by the branches, and staff employed within them, would be transferred. The new business would be formed from some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales, all branches of Lloyds TSB Scotland plc and Cheltenham & Gloucester plc; these would operate under the TSB brand as TSB Bank plc. The remainder of the Lloyds TSB business would be rebranded as Lloyds Bank. Lloyds Banking Group reached a Heads of Terms agreement in July 2012 to sell the Verde branches to The Co-operative Bank for £750 million. The final transfer of TSB Bank plc to the new owner was due to be completed by late 2013. In February 2013, it was reported that Lloyds Banking Group were considering a stock market flotation of the TSB business as an alternative, should the transfer not be completed. On 24 April 2013, The Co- operative Bank decided not to proceed with the acquisition because of the economic downturn and the tough regulatory environment imposed on banks. Lloyds Banking Group said that the rebranding to TSB Bank would still take place and that the new bank will be divested through an initial public offering in 2014. TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, under CEO Paul Pester. Lloyds Banking Group announced that 25% of TSB's shares would be floated on 24 June 2014; however, with the offer being 10 times oversubscribed, 35% of TSB's shares were sold at 260p on 20 June. Banco Sabadell agreed to purchase TSB in March 2015, and completed the acquisition on 8 July 2015. The purchase meant Lloyds sold its final holding in TSB. Divisions and subsidiaries =Private equity= In 2016, Lloyds's private equity division, Lloyds Development Capital (LDC), acquired a 33% stake in game developer Team17 in exchange for a investment.

Sponsorships and responsible business programmes  Lloyds Banking Group is an active supporter of disability rights and best practice; it is a Gold member of the Employers’ Forum on Disability. In 2010, the group helped create and currently sponsors the Royal Association for Disability Rights (RADAR) Radiate network, which aims to support and develop a talent pool of people with disabilities and health conditions, and to potentially act as a source of thinking for organisations on how 'disabled talent' is best spotted and developed. In 2011, Lloyds Banking Group established the Lloyds Scholars Programme, a social mobility programme aimed at UK students, in partnership with nine leading UK universities. The Scholars Programme takes 15 students per university per year and consists of a £1000 per annum scholarship paid directly to the student to help with living costs, a Lloyds Banking Group mentor and two ten-week internships, paid at £18,000 pro rata. The programme supports students throughout their university career and requires Scholars to complete 100 hours of volunteering in their local community, per year of their degree. There are also restrictions on who can apply, which exclude medical and veterinary students, as well as anyone with a residual household income as defined by their student funding body of more than £25,000 per annum, since the programme is a social mobility initiative. Lloyds Scholars must be completing an undergraduate course at one of the Group's nine partner universities: * University College London * University of Bath * University of Birmingham * University of Bristol * University of Edinburgh * University of Oxford * University of Warwick * University of Sheffield * Queen's University Belfast.

This, when added to the other brands of the Lloyds Banking Group, was twice the number of complaints received by Barclaysthe next-most-complained-about UK bank. The Financial Ombudsman Service upheld fewer complaints against Lloyds TSB than it did against Barclays. =Islamic Account= In 2014, Lloyds launched the 'Islamic Account', a current account aimed at Muslims and which it stated was compliant with Sharia law - namely, the prohibition of credit or debit interest. Critics of the new policy stated that the account amounted to religious discrimination, as users of the Sharia-compliant account would not incur interest if they went overdrawn, in contrast with users of typical current accounts. The bank responded that the account was available to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and that comparisons of interest rates between its Islamic Account and traditional current accounts were \\"meaningless\\". =HBOS fraud= Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for failing to compensate, or even apologise to, victims of fraud perpetrated by employees of HBOS. = Overdraft fees = In January 2019, the Group was criticized by the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee for changes to its overdraft fees policy. Rachel Reeves MP said of the changes that \\"While [they] might be legal, they are not within the spirit of the FCA's recommendations [to scrap overdraft fees and replace them with a single interest rate] and that they would \\"increase the charges for the vast majority of customers\\".

Denominations may use \\"interfaith\\" for both cases, or disagree over whether another group is a Christian denomination or a non-Christian religion. Some denominations forbid interfaith marriage, basing this ban on New Testament verse and the Old Testament verse Deuteronomy 7:3 (see also Ezra 9–10.). The Catholic Church has defined criteria on interfaith marriage recognition and the Eastern Orthodox Church also has rules which are similar in most respects. Some Christian denominations impose restrictions on interdenominational marriages. Inter-denominational marriages The Catholic Church requires a dispensation for mixed marriages. The Catholic party's ordinary (typically a bishop) has the authority to grant them. The baptized non-Catholic partner does not have to convert. Previously (under Ne Temere) the non-Catholic had to agree to raise any children Catholic, but under current rules only the Catholic spouse must promise to do all that is in his or her power to do so. The non-Catholic partner must be made \\"truly aware\\" of the meaning of the Catholic party's promise. It is forbidden to have a second religious ceremony in a different religion or one ceremony performed together by ministers of different religions. However, it is possible to waive the requirement of form (by granting a dispensation), so that for example one ceremony performed by the minister of another religion or a civil magistrate will be sufficient. Marriages with members of Eastern Orthodox Churches are valid but illicit without proper observance of the form or dispensation from it, as long as a sacred minister is present and other canonical requirements are observed. Inter-religious marriages In 2009, Portuguese Cardinal Jose Policarpo discouraged Portuguese girls from marrying Muslims, due to the fact that it is sometimes difficult to raise children in the faith after a marriage. Marriages between a Catholic and an unbaptized person are not sacramental and fall under the impediment of disparity of worship. They are invalid without a dispensation, for which authority lies with the ordinary of the place of marriage. In addition, the Catholic Church recognizes the Pauline privilege, wherein a Catholic may marry an unbaptized previously married person who consents to convert, but only if the unbaptized person's spouse refuses to become a Catholic also (similar to Muslim views on marrying previously-married non-Muslims).

They arise, for example, in the study of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra.  Definition  Let C be an additive category, or more generally an additive -linear category for a commutative ring . We call C a Krull–Schmidt category provided that every object decomposes into a finite direct sum of objects having local endomorphism rings. Equivalently, C has split idempotents and the endomorphism ring of every object is semiperfect.  Properties  One has the analogue of the Krull–Schmidt theorem in Krull–Schmidt categories: An object is called indecomposable if it is not isomorphic to a direct sum of two nonzero objects. In a Krull–Schmidt category we have that *an object is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring is local. *every object is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable objects. *if X_1 \\\\oplus X_2 \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus X_r \\\\cong Y_1 \\\\oplus Y_2 \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus Y_s where the X_i and Y_j are all indecomposable, then r=s, and there exists a permutation \\\\pi such that X_{\\\\pi(i)} \\\\cong Y_i for all . One can define the Auslander–Reiten quiver of a Krull–Schmidt category.  Examples  * An abelian category in which every object has finite length.This is the classical case, see for example Krause (2012), Corollary 3.3.3. This includes as a special case the category of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra. * The category of finitely-generated modules over a finiteA finite -algebra is an -algebra which is finitely generated as an -module. -algebra, where is a commutative Noetherian complete local ring.Reiner (2003), Section 6, Exercises 5 and 6, p. 88. * The category of coherent sheaves on a complete variety over an algebraically-closed field.Atiyah (1956), Theorem 2. = A non-example = The category of finitely-generated projective modules over the integers has split idempotents, and every module is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the regular module, the number being given by the rank. Thus the category has unique decomposition into indecomposables, but is not Krull- Schmidt since the regular module does not have a local endomorphism ring.

To qualify, the homeowner needs to have: *legal action threatened *consent of all property owners (e.g., both husband and wife) *proof of primary residence *no inhibition contract against sale of the property Mortgage shortfall Many people find themselves being asked to pay large sums by their mortgage lender after being repossessed or handing in their house keys.

Dennis was first introduced as a teacher at Hollyoaks Comprehensive School. He was married to Helen and was Lewis and Mandy's father. An abusive alcoholic, he beat up Helen and Lewis and molested Mandy. When he finds out that Mandy is dating Sol Patrick, he flew into a rage and raped her. Mandy briefly ran away, and then told the police what Dennis had done to her. He was arrested and eventually found guilty of rape, for which he was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. During his imprisonment, Lewis committed suicide. Dennis was released from prison five years later, and returned to Hollyoaks. He tried to explain himself to Mandy, but she refused to listen. Dennis then tried to mend his relationship with Helen when she took him to where Lewis's ashes had been scattered. She forgives him for what he has done. Mandy arrived with Tony Hutchinson, Helen's husband Gordon Cunningham and his son Max Cunningham to get rid of Dennis, and a fight broke out between Max and Dennis. Dennis was last seen telling Mandy that he is dying of cancer, hoping she might forgive him. She bought him some alcohol to quicken his death, telling him she could never forgive him.

He was the son of zoologist Antoine Louis Dugès (1797-1838). Alfredo Dugès is largely remembered for his extensive studies of Mexican herpetology. He studied medicine at the University of Paris, and in 1852 emigrated to Mexico. He settled in Guanajuato, where he worked as an obstetrician, also giving classes in natural history at the Escuela de Estudios Superiores de Guanajuato. With his brother, entomologist Eugenio Dugès (1826-1895), he organized frequent field trips in order to collect specimens. Dugès published numerous scientific papers in several fields including herpetology, botany, and entomology. At Guanajuato, he was director of the local museum, later named the Museo Alfredo Dugès(es) in his honor. In Mexico, he described 40 new species of reptiles and amphibians, of which nearly half are considered valid today.SSAR Herps (biography) As a botanist, he is the taxonomic authority of the genus Barcena (family Rhamnaceae).IPNI List of plants described by Dugès.

History The Benedictine abbey at Bonneval was founded in 857 by a knight called Foulques under the auspices of Charles of Provence, great- grandson of Charlemagne. (The town of the same name subsequently grew up around the monastery). Originally dedicated to the Roman martyrs Saints Marcellinus and Peter, the abbey took the name of Florentinus after the transfer here of relics of the more local Saints Florentinus and Hilarius, martyred in Burgundy, in thanks for services rendered by the monks of Bonneval to abbot Aurelian of Ainay Abbey. During the monks' return trip from Roanne to Orléans so many miracles occurred and the saints became so popular that the abbey was known from then on by their names, and later by that of Florentinus only. In 911, Bonneval Abbey was attacked by invading Normans and burnt down. It was not until 50 years later that it was rebuilt, with the support of Eudes, son of Thibaut the Cheat (Thibaut le Tricheur). In 1110, Louis VI, King of France, took the abbey under royal protection for political reasons. The 12th and 13th centuries were the high period of Bonneval Abbey. The Hundred Years' War had a very damaging effect on the monastery. In 1420, Henry V, King of England, attacked it and once again it was pillaged and burnt down. It was not rebuilt until the end of the 15th century, under René d’Illiers, Bishop of Chartres, who among other things rebuilt the abbots' lodging over the sub- basements of the 13th century. In 1568, the Grand Condé, at the head of the Protestants, attacked the abbey, which was largely burnt down again. At the French Revolution the abbey's property and premises were declared a national asset and the remaining buildings sold to a businessman who installed a thread-making factory and later a carpet factory. In 1845, it was turned into an agricultural settlement for abandoned children, and in 1861, the lunatic asylum of the department of Eure-et-Loir. The abbots' lodging was restored at the end of the 19th century to its original Early Renaissance style under the leadership of the director, Dr Vincent Bigot. The abbey buildings now accommodate a psychiatric hospital, the Centre Hospitalier Henry Ey, named for the distinguished psychiatrist Henry Ey (1900–1977), for many years its director. Two large pictures formerly in the monastery refectory are now in the parish church of Notre-Dame in Bonneval, depicting the miracle of the loaves and the fishes and Jesus healing Simon the Leper, a copy of an original by Nicolas Poussin.

The itch can be so intense that sufferers will scratch their own skin to a bleeding condition. The condition is becoming increasingly common, presenting in patients who are usually fair skinned and middle aged and indulge in golf, tennis, outdoor table tennis, sailing, or other leisure outdoor activities in sunny climates.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . The cause is not known, although there are a few lines of thought on what causes it. No cure has been found, but good control with near 100% relief can be achieved. The intense itch/scratch cycle can be broken by applying a topical skin coolant gel like Biofreeze (or a substance containing menthol, camphor or other topical coolant) to affected itchy areas, and then consistently applying 100+SPF sunscreen to affected skin of arms, shoulders, neck, etc., whenever they are expected to be exposed to the sun. When combined, these treatments can bring almost full relief. Many different medications and types of topical creams have been experimented with, but none seem to make any difference, except for the above. The application of ice packs to the affected area can also diminish the itch short-term.  Causes  Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a localized pruritus of the dorsolateral aspect of the arm. BRP is an enigmatic condition with a controversial cause; some authors consider BRP to be a photodermatosis, whereas other authors attribute BRP to compression of cervical nerve roots. BRP may be attributed to a neuropathy, such as chronic cervical radiculopathy. The possibility of an underlying neuropathy should be considered in the evaluation and treatment of all patients with BRP. The main cause of BRP is not known, but there is evidence to suggest that BRP may arise in the nervous system. Cervical spine disease may also be an important contributing factor. Patients with BRP may have underlying cervical spine pathology. Whether this association is causal or coincidental remains to be determined. There is controversy regarding the cause of brachioradial pruritus: is it caused by a nerve compression in the cervical spine or is it caused by a prolonged exposure to sunlight? In many patients, itching of the arms or shoulders is seasonal. Some patients reported neck pain. BRP can be linked to the thyroid. Treatments Symptom management may include the topical application of lidocaine or capsaicin, cervical traction, and good hygiene practices. Treatment with lamotrigine has been reported. Treatment by acupuncture has been reported.  See also  * List of cutaneous conditions  References  Further reading  * Dermatology 1977;195:414-5.  * Henry JB.

Early years Robbins was born in Norfolk, Connecticut, the ninth child of the Rev. Ammi Ruhamah Robbins, and Elizabeth (Le Baron) Robbins. Ammi was the first minister of Norfolk. He had 12 siblings. Robbins entered Yale University at the age of 15. In January 1796, he began a diary which he kept up through 1854. While in college, Robbins also began collecting books, a passion that would eventually define his life. He graduated from Yale in 1796, though he spent his senior year at Williams College, where his father was a trustee, and is listed as a 1796 alumnus of Williams as well. Career =Teacher and minister= For the first six years after graduating from university, Robbins taught, preached, and studied theology. In 1798, he was licensed to preach by the Litchfield North Association. From 1799 to 1802, he was in charge of the Danbury, Connecticut's academy. In 1803, the Connecticut Missionary Society, the evangelistic arm of the Connecticut General Association of Congregational ministers, sent him to a new settlement on the Western Reserve, Ohio where he spent three years organizing churches before returning to New England in poor health. From 1808-1827, he preached in East Windsor, Connecticut. His brother, Rev. Francis L. Robbins, was the pastor in the next town of Enfield, Connecticut.Tarbox, p. 9 From there he went to preach in Stratford, Connecticut.Leonard, p. 224 Robbins succeeded his uncle, Rev.

The seeds were sown in 1822 when Robbins publicly suggested the creation of a historical society in Connecticut. After its establishment in 1825 in Hartford, Connecticut, he became its first corresponding secretary. In 1844, educator Henry Barnard offered Robbins the position of librarian at the Connecticut Historical Society, the society elders being as interested in Robbins' book collection as they were in Robbins' services. By the time Robbins left for Hartford, he had over 4,000 volumes,Leonard, p. 230 mostly on subjects of history and theology. A notable part of the collection was the 385 volume Journal des sçavans, the earliest published scholarly periodical. The collection also included 596 coins, such as a Roman denarius. Never having married, he revised his Last Will several times in an effort to assure his library was sustained after his death. On May 27, 1846, he bequeath his library to the historical society in exchange for an annual salary of $600. Legacy Robbins died at the age of 79 in Colebrook, Connecticut at the home of his niece. In addition to the extensive book collection, Robbins bequeath $3,000 to the society to care for the books, and to enlarge the collection. Each book contains a bookplate and all the bookplates include a record of the price paid for the book. The society also has Robbins' original bookshelves.

James Fredrick Gosnell then jumped to the Board of Control in a \\"secret\\" ballot amongst council members, then ran as mayor in 1971.

He reflected in 1985 that he \\"hated running, and preferred game situations...when I played football the only time I ran was when a 300 pound lineman was tracking me down.\\" Upon graduation from Laurier, Tom and Bill Gosnell played with Senior ORFU London Lords as two of the team's youngest players. \\"When Tom was with the Brantford Bisons (Ontario Junior Football Conference), the Hamilton Tiger-Cats asked three or 4 of them to camp.\\" Gosnell turned down the opportunity to try out as a tight end when he wanted to be a quarterback. Alderman Gosnell had not been short of controversy during his seven years as alderman. Marc Emery, the former owner of City Lights Book Shop, was one of the few willing to comment about the new mayor. \\"He was one of the worst aldermen in my experience. You couldn't get a hold of him. I had to bother and harass the guy to get him to call back,\\" said Emery. Gosnell responded that \\"the point is well made.\\" As a business person and alderman often limited the public's access to him. \\"There were times in the past, and I'm the first to admit it, where I didn't get back to people as quickly as I could. And in some cases I didn't get back to them at all because along the way the message got lost or whatever.\\" Marc Emery laid another charge that \\"Gosnell was elected because of his good looks and his father's name. (Tom) has 3 years to prove that wrong.\\" Mayoral campaign At 34, Gosnell announced on September 3, 1985 at the London City Press Club that he was running for mayor. The odds seemed against him but of the six competing for the mayor's position he had the best chance. In private his father was harboring doubts as incumbent mayor Al Gleeson was a formidable foe. Canada had just gone through a period of high interest rates and high unemployment and there was an appetite for change. Gosnell was also as well known as many long-time politicians during the campaign as his father popularized the family name. Gleeson had also tried to run for a federal Liberal nomination for London East when people such as Michael Coon, a salesman to Selby Young Printing stated, \\"We decided that Gleeson had declared his political colours and we hadn't. We could go into this (the mayoral race) apolitically.\\" Federally, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada had beat the Liberal Party of Canada under John Turner in the 1984 Canadian federal election assisting any non-Liberal party at the time. The \\"Gosnow\\" campaign started using \\"Gos Now!\\" buttons and the night before the election with Gleeson still favored, hundreds of green lawn signs sprung up in clusters on every major street corner in London. Some claim it was the decisive turning point in the campaign. Gosnell won by 2,847 votes. \\"I'm Aggressive\\" Gosnell reflected for the London Free Press in 1986 that his opinionated side comes from his father. During his university years when he let his hair grow long and wore peace patches on the pockets of his blue jeans, the father and son did not get along famously. In his university years Gosnell challenged authority, turning $2 parking tickets into 14-dollar summonses until one day the police arrived at his father's home on Wharncliffe Road South when Fred pulled Tom out of bed by the ankles one morning to find out why the police were at the door. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats coach Tom Mooney also had learned what it was like to be on the receiving end of Gosnell's temper. Gosnell unleashed a verbal tirade upon learning they wanted to try him out as a tight end and not a quarterback. The explanation was \\"rich in locker room vernacular lest there was any ambiguity in his position.\\" \\"He was so blunt about it that it was very easy to be blunt back to him.\\" Gosnell said \\"I realized at the time that I probably didn't have the ability to go on as a pro ball player, so it was a lot easier to do it.\\" He then decided to run as mayor having reached his pinnacle of quarterback in semi-pro. When he became mayor and until this day he still speaks his mind and when asked what he considered his most outstanding qualification to be mayor, he responded \\"I'm aggressive.\\" Mayor's vision Gosnell's objective was to get the city on an aggressive approach to improving downtown. He had bought a rooming house and began to convert it back to a single-family dwelling. He spoke of how \\"we have streetscapes and facades downtown that are fantastic, We've got to do whatever we can to preserve them. We are strong enough as a city to turn to major developers who own major blocks downtown and say we are not going to go bankrupt with or without your development, so you will never find the city in the position (where) we're going to come crawling to you. We can do very well downtown if we just restore and rebuild what we have there now. We obviously want major developers to do things downtown but we're not in a situation of a Brantford or a Chatham, where our economies are falling apart. Our economy is very strong. We can make a major improvement downtown with or without their multi-million dollar votes. We want (developers). We encourage them. We also want them to understand it's a two-way street.\\" See also *List of mayors of London, Ontario References External links *Official website Mayors of London, Ontario 2014 deaths 1951 births ","title":"Tom Gosnell"},{"id":"21099716","text":"Tommy Olsen is a Norwegian ski-orienteering competitor.

The film was directed by James F. Collier and produced by Frank R. Jacobson for Billy Graham's film distribution and production company World Wide Pictures. The original story and screenplay was written by Stella Linden. The cast included Ann Holloway, Dora Bryan, Avril Angers, Geoffrey Bayldon, Peter Barkworth, Mona Washbourne, Earl Cameron, Charles Lloyd-Pack, and Billy Graham himself, filmed at his \\"London Crusade\\" in 1967. Plot Jamie Hopkins (Cliff Richard) is an art student and frustrated pop star who lives with his mother (Dora Bryan). She works as a receptionist for Dr. Berman (Donald Bisset), a psychiatrist who is experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Jamie wants to make money quickly, and begins to work at the doctor's office as a pretence in order to steal drugs. When his girlfriend Carol (Ann Holloway) is converted to Christianity while attending a crusade led by evangelist Billy Graham, she attempts to show him the error of his ways. Soon after, Jamie is caught stealing from Dr. Berman's drug supply, and attempting to double-cross drug dealer Alec Fitch (Geoffrey Bayldon). Initially hostile toward his girlfriend's newfound faith, Jamie eventually accepts it.

It is open daily except Monday in the warmer months; an admission fee is charged. The park was created between 1899-1913 on the grounds of Château Colbert by noted Parisian architect Alexandre Marcel (1860-1928), designer of the Cambodia pavilion at the Exposition Universelle (1900), for the château's industrialist owner. Indeed, the park's Khmer elements are reproduced from molds from the exhibition. Having married the owner's daughter, Marcel often dwelt in the château as he oversaw its landscaping. After his death, she remained in residence until her own death in 1945, after which time the park fell into desolation for 40 years. In 1976 the château's property was cut in three, with the municipality purchasing the park's segment in 1980. Restoration began in 1987, based upon photographs and memories, and by 2004 the garden was named a \\"Jardin Remarquable\\" by the ministry of culture. Today the park is the largest Japanese garden in France. It contains about 300 plant species, with water features, a bridge, and a pagoda, as well as azaleas, camellias, rhododendrons, and Japanese maples.

The term \\"guttate\\" is used to describe the drop-like appearance of skin lesions. Guttate psoriasis is classically triggered by a bacterial infection, usually an upper respiratory tract infection.  Signs and symptoms  Typically, guttate psoriasis erupts after a throat infection, or strep throat. Initially, when the throat infection has cleared up, the person can feel fine for several weeks before noticing the appearance of red spots. They appear small at first, like a dry red spot which is slightly itchy. When scratched or picked, the top layer of dry skin is removed, leaving dry, red skin beneath with white, dry areas marking where flakes of dry skin stop and start. In the weeks that follow, the spots can grow to as much as an inch in diameter. Some of the larger ones may form a pale area in the center which is slightly yellow. Guttate psoriasis can occur on any part of the body, particularly the legs, arms, torso, eyelids, back, bottom, bikini-line and neck. The number of lesions can range from 5 to over 100. Generally the parts of the body most affected are seen on the arms, legs, back and torso.  Causes  Genetic and environmental factors can influence the predilection for guttate psoriasis. Human leukocyte antigens, especially those in the HLA-C group are associated with the skin disorder. Beta-hemolytic streptococci infection is the major contributing environmental factor. The typical route of infection is the upper respiratory system. Rarely it is also caused by a skin infection surrounding the anus (perianal streptococcal dermatitis).  Diagnosis  Guttate psoriasis can typically be diagnosed by clinical examination alone.  Management  The treatments used for plaque psoriasis can also be used for guttate psoriasis. Few studies have specifically focused on guttate psoriasis management, so there are currently no firm guidelines for managing guttate psoriasis differently from plaque psoriasis. Due to the role streptococcal infection plays in the development of guttate psoriasis, systemic antibiotics have been considered as a potential treatment option. There is uncertain evidence whether systemic antibiotics or tonsillectomy are effective and safe in treating the disease. The condition often usually clears up on its own within weeks to months, and only about one third of patients will develop chronic plaques.  Epidemiology  Guttate psoriasis accounts for approximately 2% of psoriasis cases.

The specific paraphilias are biastophilia (paraphilic rape), exhibitionism, frotteurism, telephone scatologia, and voyeurism. According to the courtship disorder hypothesis, there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.  Courtship disorder hypothesis  According to the courtship disorder hypothesis, there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases.Freund, K.

(1986). \\"The concept of courtship disorder.\\" Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 12, 79–92. These phases are: \\"(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse.\\"Cantor, J.

According to Freund, these paraphilias \\"can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or erotic fantasy in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way.\\"Freund, K.

Appropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as public nudity or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like Carnival or Mardi Gras. Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered.Maharajh, H. D., & Konings, M. (2007). Dancing frotteurism and courtship disorder in Trinidad and Tobago. Journal of Chinese Clinical Medicine, 7(2).

It performed its first concert in August 2008 in the Victoria Concert Hall and has been hailed as one of \\"Singapore's greatest musical glories\\" and was the recipient of the 2009 HSBC Youth Excellence Award. It has since performed at the Singapore Arts Festival, Lichfield Music Festival and the Cheltenham Music Festival in the United Kingdom. History Inaugural performance The Orchestra of the Music Makers' name is derived from the poem Ode by Arthur O'Shaughnessy, which reads: > '' We are the music makers, > And we are the dreamers of dreams, > Wandering by lone sea-breakers, > And sitting by desolate streams > '' The poem was chosen because of its inspiring message, expressing well the group's 'ambition and desires', and it implicitly identified itself with the goals of a new orchestra composed of youthful musicians in support of others like them. The Orchestra was formed after a period of discussion in early 2008 and was established as the Orchestra of the Music Makers in August 2008. Its first performance was a major benefit concert held in Singapore's Victoria Concert Hall and supported by the Singapore branch of HSBC, a considerable accomplishment for an orchestra without a proven track record. In this inaugural concert it accompanied Gabriel Ng, Clare Yeo, and Janani Sridhar, three of Singapore's young talented soloists in concerti and arias. Among other high-profile guests at the event was the President of Singapore. However, the Orchestra's first concert on its own was in January 2009, when it performed at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music Concert Hall. During these initial months and throughout most of its first year it faced considerable monetary challenges relating to its operating costs, in particular, concerning the rental of performance venues. rehearsal spaces, and instruments. In August 2009, the month of the first anniversary of its inaugural concert, the Orchestra was guerdoned with the prestigious HSBC Youth Excellence Award, carrying a cash value of S$200,000, a very significant achievement given that the group had been in existence for only slightly over one year.

More recently, continuing a trend of critically acclaimed performances of Mahler's symphonies, the performance of the 5th Symphony was regarded as \\"being characterised by force of will and an overall sweep that was totally captivating\\" and \\"a totally absorbing and at times electrifying performance...the famous Adagietto floated along ethereally, completely devoid of excess pathos...and among the more memorable live performances I have attended in my time have been those from Horenstein and Bernstein, neither of which, I can honestly say, quite matched what Chan produced with his dedicated bunch of amateurs.\\" The Orchestra's debut CD release of Mahler's 1st Symphony was praised in the international press, Furthermore, its landmark release of Mahler's 2nd Symphony garnered the following comments,  Discography  References External links * Orchestra of the Music Makers Official Website Musical groups established in 2008 Singaporean orchestras Symphony orchestras ","title":"Orchestra of the Music Makers"},{"id":"21100057","text":"King Abdullah II of Jordan and U.S. President George W.

Five Tunis Field Battalions were created between 9 November and 15 November 1942 by renaming a like number of Afrika Marsch- Bataillone (Africa Replacement Draft Battalions) that were originally intended to be used to refill the ranks of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's battered Africa Corps. These five battalions, Tunis Field Battalions T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5, were instead airlifted from Sicily beginning on 10 November 1942 to help defend the Bizerte and Tunis Bridgeheads in Vichy France-controlled Tunisia. Not originally conceived as combat units, intended only as replacement pools composed of a variety of specialist as well as combat troops, these Tunis Field Battalions lacked heavy weapons, vehicles, field kitchens and communications equipment. Nevertheless, in the days following the Allied Landings in Northwest Africa (Operation Torch) that began on 8 November 1942, these units, joined by Luftwaffe paratroopers, were all the German High Command had available to seize Tunisian bridgeheads before the Allies got there first. Having won the race the Tunis, the Germans then began protracted defensive warfare in the mountains of western Tunisia, where the Tunis Field Battalions found themselves incorporated into other German divisions that were lacking infantry, including the 10th Panzer Division, the 334th Infantry Division, and the Hermann Göring Division. Two Tunis Field Battalions, T3 and T4, were incorporated into Division von Broich/von Manteuffel; a provisional infantry division formed from a variety of units including Fallschirmjäger, Italian infantry and units scraped together from Rommel's Army.

The new organization, the Vereinigte Yiddishe Gewerkschaften (United Hebrew Trades) patterned itself on an earlier trade union organization of German-speaking socialists, the Deutsche Vereignte Gewerkshaften (German United Trades), an organization which dispatched two official delegates to the foundation meeting of the Jewish organization.Epstein, Jewish Labor in USA, pg. 169. The gathering was also joined by the editor of the SLP's German- language newspaper, Wilhelm Rosenberg. Only two tiny unions joined the new Jewish federation at the time of its formation, the typesetters' union and the chorus union — groups with a combined total membership of just 75 people. Despite the organization's tiny size at the time of its establishment, a full slate of officers were elected, with B. Weinstein named secretary and Morris Hillquit chosen as corresponding secretary. Delegates to the German United Trades were also elected. The United Hebrew Trades rapidly gained recognition by New York unions and by March 1890 the UHT could claim 22 affiliated unions, including sizable organizations of tailors and cloakmakers.Epstein, Jewish Labor in USA, pp. 169-170. =DeLeonist interval= In 1895, the UHT became a member of the SLP sponsored Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, becoming \\"District Alliance 2\\" in February 1896. Some of its constituent unions, however, were still affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and splintered to become the Federated Hebrew Trades of Greater New York in September 1897. As the ST&LA; declined, the UHT disaffiliated in 1899 and merged with the newer federation. =Membership growth= By 1910, Weinstein was able to report that the UHT had 106 unions under its umbrella, consisting of 150,000 working men and women. In 1914 the UHT celebrated its 25th anniversary in Carnegie Hall. Clarence Darrow and Samuel Gompers were featured speakers at the event. In May 1915, eight members of the association's Executive Committee were indicted in New York City and charged with hiring gangsters, including Benjamin Fein, to intimidate uncooperative employers. UHT secretary Abraham Shiplacoff told the New York Times that \\"we are not going to allow the reactionary District Attorney to eat our beloved leaders alive.\\" By 1922, the UHT represented approximately 200,000 workers. In 1933, United Hebrew Trades' activists joined with other organizations and trade unions to form the Jewish Labor Committee, which had its founding convention in February 1934. In 1938, when the UHT celebrated its 50th anniversary, it had 250,000 members. =Unification with the Jewish Labor Committee= In the 1990s, the UHT changed its relationship with the JLC, from that of an independent affiliated organization to the New York Division of the JLC.

History  Two different types of scrip were issued during the occupation of Okinawa Prefecture by US forces. The United States military used a separate scrip called \\"A type yen\\" while \\"B type yen\\" were only used by the local civilians. In the brief time between the 1945 battle of Okinawa and the beginning of the US occupation, the islands went from a currency-free system, relying upon barter and distributions of supplies from the authorities, to the reintroduction of currency with the B yen, the introduction of the new Japanese yen (both \\"new yen\\" and \\"B yen\\" being used concurrently for a time) and then the establishment of the B yen as the only legal currency.\\"The Currency Switch from B yen to dollars\\" (B円からドルへの通貨交換 , B en kara doru he no tsūkakōkan). Okinawa Prefectural Archives (沖縄県公文書館) Official Blog. 2008-09-17. Accessed 2009-2-24. Beginning in 1948, the A type yen was deprecated, and B type yen came to be used by military and civilians alike. Though the rest of Occupied Japan continued to use regular Japanese yen throughout the occupation, military scrip was introduced in Okinawa because, even at that time, the US military government intended to continue occupation of Okinawa long after ending it in the Home Islands. Steps were taken to prevent inflation which would have resulted from the illegal influx of regular yen from the Home Islands, and once the economy in Okinawa was considered stable enough, the B yen was done away with, and the US dollar brought into use. An announcement was made by the office of Lt. Gen. Donald Prentice Booth (High Commissioner of the Ryukyu Islands and Commanding General of the U.S. Army on the Islands), and as of September 16, 1958, the B yen was replaced with the US dollar, at an exchange rate of 120 B yen to the dollar. The exchange rate at the time for the Japanese yen used in \\"mainland\\" Japan was 360 yen to US$1.Antweiler, Werner. \\"Pacific Exchange Rate Service - Foreign Currency Units per 1 U.S. Dollar, 1948-2007.\\" University of British Columbia. 2007. Accessed 2009-2-24. This was done, in part, to encourage foreign investment by aligning Okinawa's economy with an international standard, though it is often said to have also contributed significantly to the dependence of Okinawa's economy upon the US, and the US military bases located there. After the B yen was demonetised, rather than being incinerated (as is usual with obsolete banknotes) the B yen banknotes were placed into large concrete containers with indelible red dye, which were buried at sea at unrecoverable depths.Civil Affairs Activities in the Ryukyu Islands for the Period Ending 30 September 1958, Volume VI Number II, Published by United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. Professor Michiko Iha of the University of the Ryukyus has argued that the B yen was part of a scheme by the occupying authorities to keep the dollar strong and yen weak, in order to more cheaply construct and maintain military bases.

Route description View east from the west end of MD 137 at Gunpowder Road near Hampstead MD 137 begins at a three-way intersection with Gunpowder Road, which heads east toward Prettyboy Reservoir, and a county-maintained continuation of Mount Carmel Road west toward Hampstead. Mount Carmel Road becomes Lower Beckleysville Road on entering Carroll County and intersects MD 88 (Black Rock Road). MD 137 heads south as a two-lane undivided road and curves east and intersects MD 25 (Falls Road). The state highway continues east through farmland along the drainage divide between Gunpowder Falls to the north and its tributary Western Run to the south and passes its namesake church, now named Mount Carmel United Methodist Church. MD 137 meets Interstate 83 (I-83, Harrisburg Expressway) at a diamond interchange with ramps staggered into four intersections. A park and ride lot is located within the northwest quadrant of this interchange. Opposite the easternmost ramp, which is from northbound I-83 to MD 137, is unsigned MD 889, the access road to the Maryland State Highway Administration's Hereford Shop.

Definitions We say that a group G satisfies the ascending chain condition (ACC) on subgroups if every sequence of subgroups of G: :1 = G_0 \\\\le G_1 \\\\le G_2 \\\\le \\\\cdots\\\\, is eventually constant, i.e., there exists N such that GN = GN+1 = GN+2 = ... . We say that G satisfies the ACC on normal subgroups if every such sequence of normal subgroups of G eventually becomes constant. Likewise, one can define the descending chain condition on (normal) subgroups, by looking at all decreasing sequences of (normal) subgroups: :G = G_0 \\\\ge G_1 \\\\ge G_2 \\\\ge \\\\cdots.\\\\, Clearly, all finite groups satisfy both ACC and DCC on subgroups. The infinite cyclic group \\\\mathbf{Z} satisfies ACC but not DCC, since (2) > (2)2 > (2)3 > ... is an infinite decreasing sequence of subgroups. On the other hand, the p^\\\\infty-torsion part of \\\\mathbf{Q}/\\\\mathbf{Z} (the quasicyclic p-group) satisfies DCC but not ACC. We say a group G is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct product of non-trivial subgroups G = H × K. Statement If G is a group that satisfies either ACC or DCC on normal subgroups, then there is a unique way of writing G as a direct product G_1 \\\\times G_2 \\\\times\\\\cdots \\\\times G_k\\\\, of finitely many indecomposable subgroups of G. Here, uniqueness means direct decompositions into indecomposable subgroups have the exchange property. That is: suppose G = H_1 \\\\times H_2 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times H_l\\\\, is another expression of G as a product of indecomposable subgroups. Then k=l and there is a reindexing of the H_i's satisfying * G_i and H_i are isomorphic for each i; * G = G_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times G_r \\\\times H_{r+1} \\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times H_l\\\\, for each r. Proof Proving existence is relatively straightforward: let be the set of all normal subgroups that can not be written as a product of indecomposable subgroups. Moreover, any indecomposable subgroup is (trivially) the one-term direct product of itself, hence decomposable. If Krull-Schmidt fails, then contains ; so we may iteratively construct a descending series of direct factors; this contradicts the DCC. One can then invert the construction to show that all direct factors of appear in this way. The proof of uniqueness, on the other hand, is quite long and requires a sequence of technical lemmas. For a complete exposition, see Hungerford 2012, p.86-8. . Remark The theorem does not assert the existence of a non-trivial decomposition, but merely that any such two decompositions (if they exist) are the same. Krull–Schmidt Theorem for Modules If E eq 0 is a module that satisfies the ACC and DCC on submodules (that is, it is both Noetherian and Artinian or – equivalently – of finite length), then E is a direct sum of indecomposable modules. Up to a permutation, the indecomposable components in such a direct sum are uniquely determined up to isomorphism. In general, the theorem fails if one only assumes that the module is Noetherian or Artinian. History The present-day Krull–Schmidt theorem was first proved by Joseph Wedderburn (Ann. of Math (1909)), for finite groups, though he mentions some credit is due to an earlier study of G.A. Miller where direct products of abelian groups were considered. Wedderburn's theorem is stated as an exchange property between direct decompositions of maximum length. However, Wedderburn's proof makes no use of automorphisms. The thesis of Robert Remak (1911) derived the same uniqueness result as Wedderburn but also proved (in modern terminology) that the group of central automorphisms acts transitively on the set of direct decompositions of maximum length of a finite group. From that stronger theorem Remak also proved various corollaries including that groups with a trivial center and perfect groups have a unique Remak decomposition. Otto Schmidt (Sur les produits directs, S. M. F. Bull. 41 (1913), 161–164), simplified the main theorems of Remak to the 3 page predecessor to today's textbook proofs. His method improves Remak's use of idempotents to create the appropriate central automorphisms. Both Remak and Schmidt published subsequent proofs and corollaries to their theorems. Wolfgang Krull (Über verallgemeinerte endliche Abelsche Gruppen, M. Z. 23 (1925) 161–196), returned to G.A. Miller's original problem of direct products of abelian groups by extending to abelian operator groups with ascending and descending chain conditions. This is most often stated in the language of modules. His proof observes that the idempotents used in the proofs of Remak and Schmidt can be restricted to module homomorphisms; the remaining details of the proof are largely unchanged. O. Ore unified the proofs from various categories include finite groups, abelian operator groups, rings and algebras by proving the exchange theorem of Wedderburn holds for modular lattices with descending and ascending chain conditions. This proof makes no use of idempotents and does not reprove the transitivity of Remak's theorems. Kurosh's The Theory of Groups and Zassenhaus' The Theory of Groups include the proofs of Schmidt and Ore under the name of Remak–Schmidt but acknowledge Wedderburn and Ore. Later texts use the title Krull–Schmidt (Hungerford's Algebra) and Krull–Schmidt–Azumaya (Curtis–Reiner). The name Krull–Schmidt is now popularly substituted for any theorem concerning uniqueness of direct products of maximum size. Some authors choose to call direct decompositions of maximum-size Remak decompositions to honor his contributions. See also * Krull–Schmidt category  References  Further reading * A.

As Pratt and Debbie travel to the IDP camp Pratt shows a flippant attitude to the situation that irritates Debbie. The janjaweed ride up on horses and force their car to stop. The driver is given a broken nose but Pratt and Debbie aren't harmed when they say they're doctors. Their medical supplies are taken, their car is made unusable and their shoes are stolen. Their only option now is to walk to the camp. When they arrive Pratt has to bandage his bleeding feet. When he takes a walk through the medical tents he gets into trouble straight away by walking in on a rape exam. He meets with Dr. Dakarai and reunites with Carter who asks for news of County. Pratt tells him about Luka and Abby expecting a baby which Carter contemplates for a moment then declares this good news. He starts to talk about Clemente but they are interrupted by a disturbance in the camp. A member of the janjaweed has been captured and is surrounded by the camp’s men who are beating him with sticks. Pratt tries to rush in and stop them but is knocked to the floor. As he watches a teenage boy smashes the man's head in with a rock. Later Pratt drinks some alcohol he smuggled in a mouthwash bottle. This wasn’t what he was expecting at all.

She won the Prix Femina for her 1967 debut novel, Elise, or the Real Life, which was also adapted into a 1970 film. Her main characters are women and the plots take place in real- life cities such as Paris. She was influenced by Honoré de Balzac. Early life Claire Etcherelli was born in 1934 in Bordeaux. Her family was poor and her father died during World War II; her education was subsequently financed by the government and she earned a Baccalauréat qualification. Before turning to writing, Etcherelli was employed in many types of workplaces, including a car assembly plant, a ball-bearing manufacturer, and a tourist agency. In 1975 she began working as editorial secretary for the journal Les Temps modernes. Works Etcherelli published her first novel, Elise ou la vraie vie (Elise, or the Real Life), in 1967. It was turned down by five publishers before being accepted by Éditions Denoël. The novel is based around the relationship of an Algerian automobile worker and a white French woman in the 1950s. It also deals with the issues that those of less privilege face such as poverty, exploitation, and social marginalization. Literary critic Liz Heron said of the novel, \\"Etcherelli's novel is significant because it describes the tensions and contradictions that make Paris life real for Elise, Etcherelli's heroine\\". Etcherelli won the Prix Femina in 1967 for this novel. The novel gained a cult following during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970, it was adapted into a film directed by Michel Drach. Etcherelli's second novel, A Propos de Clémence (About Clémence) (1971), is about \\"the difficulty of knowing oneself and the impossibility of knowing another person\\". Her third novel, Un Arbre voyageur (A Travelling Tree) (1978), focuses on two women who attempt to start an unconventional family that has no patriarch. The family was to be based on trust, solidarity, and women's leadership. Etcherelli said the novel \\"gave her the most pleasure to write\\". A review of the book in An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, Volume 1 says that it \\"offers us a beautiful, penetrating account of the lives of ordinary, though shrewdly intelligent and inconspicuously sensitive women of France's late sixties and early seventies\\". Etcherelli later wrote a 1982 compilation of poetic texts, titled Delirante (Delirious Woman). Writing style Etcherelli's main characters are women from a working-class background. She cites Honoré de Balzac as a major influence on her work. Cities and places that exist within those cities are frequently used in her work, with the cities creating a metaphor for the aspects of life. Personal life Etcherelli is the mother of two sons.

It was named in 2009 by Clifford A. Miles and Clark J. Miles and the type species is Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani. The generic name is explained by the describers as meaning \\"man-bull lizard\\"; the specific epithet honours Vilayanur S. Ramachandran who purchased the fossil for $10,000 from the trader Hollis Butts, based in Japan, and made it available to science. It is known only from a complete skull of unknown provenance, but probably recovered from the Gobi Desert. While it had a distinctive armored bull-like head and a more primitive braincase, it shares the typical features of an ankylosaurid. Restoration A controversy has surfaced around the provenance of this skull. Some paleontologists claim that this fossil was removed from the Gobi desert without the permission of the Chinese government and sold without proper documentation. V.S. Ramachandran, who purchased the fossil in Tucson, Arizona (United States), says that he would be happy to repatriate the fossil to the appropriate nation, if someone shows him \\"evidence it was exported without permit\\". For a short time, the specimen was on loan to the Victor Valley Museum in Apple Valley, California, but in 2007, Ramachandran reacquired it.naturenews, February 2, 2009 In 2013, the new specimen MAE 98 179, a skull, axis and first cervical half-ring were reported from the Djadokhta Formation at Ukhaa Tolgod locality, establishing the provenance of this taxon. A 2014 study by Victoria Arbour, Philip Currie, and Demchig Badamgarav suggested that Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani is probably a junior synonym of Tarchia kielanae, however, the redescription of the cranial anatomy of Tarchia in 2017 concluded that Minotaurasaurus was a distinct taxon.

Water from the Patapsco River is used as the heat sink of the condensers of the steam turbines. History Riverside Generating Station and adjacent electrical substation. The site of the Riverside Generating Station was originally purchased by the Consolidated Gas and Light Company of Baltimore, a predecessor company to Constellation Energy, in 1922 for the location of a manufactured gas facility that was never built. In 1942, the 60 MW steam turbine and boiler Unit 1 was installed at a cost of US$6.5 million. Two additional 60 MW steam electric units, Unit 2 and Unit 3, were placed in service in 1944 and 1948, and Units 4 and 5 entering commercial operation in 1951. Units 1, 2, 3, and 5 were shut down in 1993. In 2008, authorization was granted to modify and reactivate Unit 5 to operate only on natural gasMaryland Public Service Commission Order No. 82006 (May 12, 2008). at an estimated cost of US$25 million. Constellation Energy merged into Exelon in 2012. Exelon announced plans to shut down Unit 4 by mid-2016. Operations Exelon normally operates the Riverside Generating Station as a peaking power plant. As the mid-Maryland region is a summer peaking load, the majority of the plant's operating time will be during hot summer days. The Riverside Generating Station is dispatched by the PJM Interconnection regional transmission organization.

This event was the most bought UFC pay-per-view of all time with a buyrate of 1.6million, until UFC 202 broke the record with 1.65million. Background The event included two championship bouts and a fight between the two coaches on the Spike TV show, The Ultimate Fighter. The main event was a rematch between UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar and Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir. This championship unification bout occurred as a result of former UFC Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture's year-long resignation from the promotion. During his absence, the UFC created an Interim championship, which Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira won by defeating Tim Sylvia. Nogueira and Mir were opposing coaches on The Ultimate Fighter: Team Nogueira vs Team Mir, and fought for the interim championship at UFC 92. During the airing of the television program, Couture returned to the company and UFC President Dana White announced he would defend the title against Lesnar at UFC 91. The winners of the Couture vs Lesnar and Nogueira vs Mir matches would fight for the undisputed title. In his fourth professional fight, Lesnar defeated Couture via technical knockout to become the UFC Heavyweight Champion. Mir was crowned interim champion after becoming the first fighter to finish Nogueira. The match between Lesnar and Mir was set for UFC 98. However, Mir injured his knee while training, and withdrew from the bout. The next day, it was announced the fight would be moved to UFC 100. Lesnar and Mir had fought once before, at UFC 81 (Lesnar's UFC debut); Mir won via kneebar submission. The co-main event featured Georges St-Pierre, defending the Welterweight Championship against Thiago Alves. Alves entered the fight after consecutive victories over three top UFC welterweights: Josh Koscheck, Matt Hughes and Karo Parisyan. St-Pierre had previously defended the title against Jon Fitch and UFC Lightweight Champion BJ Penn. The third match on the main card was between top middleweight contenders Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping. The two were opposing coaches on the ninth season of The Ultimate Fighter (Henderson on Team USA and Bisping on Team UK). Bisping had a professional MMA record of 17–1, and was undefeated since moving to middleweight. He entered the bout following wins over Charles McCarthy, Jason Day and Chris Leben. On June 2, it was announced the winner of the fight would get a shot at UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva. A preliminary match-up between Dong Hyun Kim and Jonathan Goulet was scheduled for the card, but Goulet withdrew due to a shoulder injury, and was replaced by TJ Grant.

History On 28 June 1861, Antonio José de Moraes sold part of Sítio Ribeirão dos Pires to the railway. This, in turn, had belonged to José Alves Siqueira, who died in 1845, and his widow Francisca Alves Bicudo. It was in this area where later the warehouse and the station were built. On 16 February 1867, with connection São Paulo-Santos to the railway, it inaugurated the temporary traffic, being the current city of Ribeirão Pires a strategical point of stop for water supply of the steam locomotives. The railway branch has already been projected in 1862 by engineer Daniel Makinson Fox the idealizer of the tilted surfaces of the mountain range. The idealized track is the same of the existing one connecting Rio Grande da Serra to Mogi das Cruzes, passing through Ribeirão Pires, branch still active of cargo transportation. But Ribeirão Pires station was opened only on 1 March 1885. The station worked next to the current one, in a still existing building, the Warehouse. Around the station there were already some Italian immigrants, but the residents were mostly German and the activities that predominated were potteries and wood extraction, but created, on February 1887, the Italian Immigrants Colony. The village around the station grew a lot, and became a city in 1953. Just like Rio Grande da Serra, the station is the same since the beginning of the century. Today, the CPTM commuter trains attend it. In 2013, the station was renamed to Ribeirão Pires-Antônio Bespalec after Antônio Bespalec, architect, urbanist, and Secretary of Environment during the administration of former Mayor Clóvis Volpi.

Mormons are the second largest religious denomination in Oregon and many influential Mormons have came from Oregon including US Senator Gordon H. Smith, Secretary of State Dennis Richardson, Deputy Secretary of State Rich Vial, Professional Basketball player Danny Ainge, and State Representative Tom Butler. Religion in the state of Oregon is remarkable in the United States, with its population ranking among the highest of religiously unaffiliated adults in the entire nation. According to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, 31% of Oregon's population was religiously unaffiliated, making it the second-highest percentage after that of Vermont. Of the Oregon residents who do identify as religiously-affiliated, the largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, which makes up approximately 14% of the state's overall population. History In 1836, French Canadian pioneers on the French Prairie in the Willamette Valley built a log cabin chapel along the Willamette River.Chapman, J. S. (1993). French prairie ceramics: the Harriet D. Munnick archaeological collection, circa 1820-1860 : a catalog and Northwest comparative guide. Anthropology northwest, no. 8. Corvallis, Or: Dept. of Anthropology, Oregon State University. The first Protestant church in Oregon was built in Oregon City starting in 1842. Completed in 1844, this Methodist church was also the first Protestant church on the continental West Coast of what became the United States. The first Roman Catholic official presence in Oregon was the apostolic vicariate for the Oregon Territory begun in 1843. By 1846, the archdiocese of Oregon was formally established. Informally considered part of the Unchurched Belt, Oregon is known for historically having a lack of religiosity compared to other U.S. states. Current statistics =Denominations= St. Mary's Cathedral in downtown Portland, Oregon Similar to many northern U.S. states, Oregon's largest religious group (among Christians and in general), based on a 2008 Pew Research Center survey, was Roman Catholics, making up 14% of the state's total population. All denominations of Protestant accounted for 30%, Mormons for 5%, Buddhists for 2%, and unaffiliated for 27%, all higher than the national average. A 2009 Gallup poll found that 69% Oregonians identified with a Christian religion. Oregon was lower than the national average in people who identify as mainline Protestants, historically black Christians, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews and Muslims. Oregon tracks the national average in its number of Hindus. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 348,239; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 104,312; and the Assemblies of God with 49,357. While Oregon has higher than average rates of evangelical Christianity and Mormonism compared to mainline or orthodox sects of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, it does have a slightly higher percentage of Buddhists regardless of sect, and is part of an overall growth in Buddhists not of ethnically Asian origin in the West. Oregon also contains the largest community of Russian Old Believers to be found in the United States (nearly 10,000 as of 2002), due to a relatively large immigrant population from areas where the church originated. =Lack of religiosity= Plurality of religious preference by state, 2001. Data is unavailable for Alaska and Hawaii. Percentage of religion against average, 2001. A 2003 study, released once every 10 years, listed Benton County, Oregon as the least religious county per capita in the United States. Only 1 in 4 people indicated that they were affiliated with one of the 149 religious groups the study identified. The study indicated that some of the disparity, however, may be attributed to the popularity of less traditional religions (ones not included as an option in the study) in the Pacific Northwest. In a 2009 Gallup poll, Oregon ranked #1 of US states with the highest percentage of residents who were unaffiliated with any religion, at 24.6%. Although 46% of Oregonians identify religion as being \\"very important\\", a full 40% of Oregonians (including those affiliated with a religion) seldom or never attend services. In a different 2009 Gallup poll, Oregon was ranked as the seventh least religious state. In response to the question, \\"Is religion an important part of your life?\\", 53% of Oregonians responded \\"yes\\". The most religious state was Mississippi, with 85%, and the least religious state was Vermont, with 42%. The states less religious than Oregon, in order, are Washington, Alaska, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In a 2006 Gallup poll, Oregonians tied for seventh state with the lowest church attendance, at 32%, along with California and Washington. Church attendance ranged from 58% to 24% in the poll. According to a 2017 study from the Public Religion Research Institute, the percentage of unaffiliated individuals was 36% (second-highest to Vermont, which was reported 41% religiously-unaffiliated).

The state highway runs from MD 45 in Hereford east to MD 23 near Shawsville. MD 138 connects northern Baltimore County with northwestern Harford County via the community of Monkton on Gunpowder Falls. The first section of the state highway was built east of Monkton in the 1910s. The remainder of MD 138 was built west of Monkton in the mid-1920s and east of Monkton in the early to mid-1930s. The state highway through Monkton was maintained by Baltimore County from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, during which the highway was relocated at Gunpowder Falls. Route description View west along MD 138 in northern Baltimore County MD 138 begins at an intersection with MD 45 (York Road) in Hereford, one block south of MD 45's intersection with MD 137 (Mount Carmel Road). The state highway heads east as two-lane undivided Monkton Road to the village of Monkton, where the highway crosses Gunpowder Falls and intersects the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail. On the east edge of the village, MD 138 veers east onto Shepperd Road and follows Charles Run upstream out of the valley. The state highway passes through the area patented in the 18th century as My Lady's Manor. In the hamlet of Shepperd, Shepperd Road ends at Troyer Road. MD 138 turns north onto Troyer Road and Troyer Road heads south as MD 562. The state highway passes through Troyer and curves along a ridge above the headwaters of Little Gunpowder Falls. MD 138 crosses the Baltimore-Harford county line and reaches its eastern terminus at MD 23 (Norrisville Road) in the hamlet of Blackhorse near Shawsville. Troyer Road continues east on the other side of the intersection as a county highway. History The first section of pavement along modern MD 138 was built along Shepperd Road from Monkton to J.M. Pearce Road between 1915 and 1921. A concrete road was constructed from Hereford to just west of Gunpowder Falls between 1925 and 1927. The gap in the improved road through Monkton was filled in 1928 and a bridge for the Northern Central Railroad to cross over MD 138 was built shortly after 1930. The state highway from J.M. Pearce Road to Shepperd and along Troyer Road to the Harford County line was constructed between 1930 and 1932. The short portion of MD 138 in Harford County was completed in 1936. MD 138 from just west of Gunpowder Falls through Monkton to east of Wesley Chapel Road was transferred from state to county maintenance in 1968. The county section of the highway was extended west to near Piney Hill Road in 1972. Baltimore County relocated the highway around and built a new bridge over Gunpowder Falls in 1975. The old highway followed what is now Old Monkton Road on either side of the river; east of the river, the highway had a right-angle turn at its railroad crossing. The gap in MD 138 was reduced to the section from just west of the new bridge to the Monkton Road - Shepperd Road intersection in 1987. MD 138 was united when that section was transferred to state maintenance in 1995.

The lake is approximately deep at the dam and provides nearly of shoreline. The lake first reached pool elevation in 1973 and is fed by Sugar Creek and natural springs. More than of public hard surfaced roads have been constructed to county road specifications. The public Oak Run Golf Course opened in mid-summer of 1976.Mrs. Don Wheeler and Dean Cree, \\"Bicentennial Issue of Victoria History\\", 1976 Geography Oak Run is located at at an elevation of .

Caddy emerged as a significant photographer of social activities on Bondi Beach in his day, only when hundreds of his photographs were re- discovered in 2007, among them the only existing documentation of an historic beach acrobatic club. Early life Born in Melbourne, Victoria, Caddy moved with his family to Sydney in 1929 when he was 15. His father left the family when Caddy was 17 and the family was living in Bondi. The young Caddy found a job as a paper pattern cutter for the Australian Home Journal in 1936, taking up photography and competitive dancing in his spare time. By the time he was 20 he had become a champion jitterbug dancer. Photographs in magazines from that period show him with Mavis Lang, the reigning Australian jitterbug champion at the time. From 1936 until 1941 he spent most weekends down at the beach, photographing his friends who were members of a local gym and becoming known as a dancer with the nickname \\"The Bondi Jitterbug\\".Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Muscle beach party,\\" by Steve Meacham, 8 January 2009 Both activities came to an end when he enlisted in the army. Photography At 15 Caddy was entering the monthly Australian Photographic Review's photographic competitions and winning. In the senior division Max Dupain of Ashfield was 19 and coming third. Caddy's \\"sunbather\\" was taken in the same year as Dupain's iconic image with the difference that the image is a closeup of someone's feet standing on the subject's back. A self-taught amateur, Caddy was well-known within camera club circles and like Dupain, his work was influenced heavily by the modernist style of the New York-based Popular Photography Magazine. =Equipment= A 1939 photograph shows Caddy posing with the camera he used, a Voigtländer Bergheil plate camera with a wire frame viewfinder, flashlight attachment and roll-film back, producing 6x6 centimetre negatives. Discovery Following his death Caddy's photographs were lost for 24 more years when his son Paul took the cardboard box of 290 negatives back to Tasmania and forgot about them. On refinding the box, his son contacted photographer Jon Lewis who informed the State Library of New South Wales. The plates turned out to be a rare collection of high-grade work with a unique subject and the photographer, a contemporary of iconic Australian photographer, Max Dupain. Within a year an exhibition (November 2008 - February 2009) at the Library was organised by the curator of photography, Alan Davies. Davies says that Caddy's photographs provide a unique body of work. Caddy was a people-oriented person which shows in his photographs compared with his contemporary, Dupain whose work focuses on the aesthetics of the scene.Slideshow \\"Lost Art of Beachobatics\\" with commentary by the curator of photography, Alan Davies =Beachobatics= Beachobatics Apart from documenting fashions and scenes, many of the photographs show the way people entertained themselves on Bondi Beach in the 1930s. The photographs cover the period from 1936 to 1941 and are the only known record of the Waverley Men's Gymnastic Club (formed 1921)Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Muscle beach party\\", by Steve Meacham, 8 January 2009  \\"Yet the exploits of these Bondi beachobats were lost to history until the chance discovery of a cardboard box full of 290 medium-format negatives taken by a man now belatedly acknowledged as one of Australia's most outstanding photographers, George Caddy\\" when they took their \\"beachobatics\\" to Bondi where the group of both men and women constructed ground pyramids of up to 10 people. Beachobatics died out after the Second World War and the Caddy photographs remain the chief resource for documents of the activities. The only surviving member of the club is Charlie Lusty. Exhibition 2009 A presentation of photographs entitled Bondi Jitterbug: George Caddy And His Camera opened in January 2009, at the State Library of NSW. Later years and death In the army, Caddy was stationed near Brisbane as a gunner in an anti-aircraft battery. He married Betty York in 1943 and his son Paul was born the following year. When he returned to civilian life in 1946, he packed away the negatives and did not resume his photographic or dancing activities. Caddy died in Maroubra in 1983.

Roller bearings may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use three or four races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the bearing housing. Balls, rollers or even cross rollers are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point- contact' bearings.Decker/Kabus, Maschinenelemente, Funktion, Gestaltung und Berechnung, Page 422, Hanser, 15th Issue 2000, The first wire race bearing was invented in 1934 by Erich Franke, co-founder of Franke & Heydrich KG in Aalen, Germany (nowadays Franke GmbH). As a young design engineer of Carl- Zeiss-Werke in Jena, Franke intended to design a very space-saving bearing for an optical device. The aim of his thoughts was a much closer relation between bearing and enclosing design to keep it as compact and as lightweight as possible.  Types  The most common type consist of two open inner and outer rings each. Types using just three rings can be used for special applications to compensate e.g. angular offset. There are types forming an converging angle ball bearing using two rows of balls set up with two race rings each. A special type for mainly radial loads can be set up with just two race rings.  Comparison with standard ball bearings  The space-saving design is the main advantage with the capability of loads and moments from all directions at the same time. Because the rolling elements run on race rings, the enclosing design is not exposed directly to stressing of the rolling process. Thus allows to use alternate materials like aluminium, brass or plastic as housing. Another advantage is that rotational resistance and pre-load can be adjusted precisely. Due to the specific design, wire race bearings have also system inherent disadvantages like increased assembly time, because the race rings must be inserted accurately into the enclosing design to ensure faultless function.  Applications  Wire race bearings are used in linear bearings of micro-positioning (XY) stages commonly found on microscopes.

Permanent villages have been found in Nubia, which date from 6000 BC. These villages were roughly contemporary with the walled town of Jericho in Palestine. Early Period Jebel Barkal The earliest Nubian architecture used perishable materials, wattle and daub, mudbricks, animal hide and other light and supple materials. Early Nubian architecture consisted of speos, structures derived from carving of rock, an innovation of the A-Group culture (c. 3800-3100 BCE), as seen in the Sofala Cave rock-cut temple. Ancient Egyptians made widespread use of speos during the New Kingdom of Egypt.Bianchi, Robert Steven. Daily Life of the Nubians. Westport: Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 227, Two types of A-Group graves exist. One was oval in shape deep. The second was oval in shape deep with a deeper second chamber.Mokhtar (editor)(1990), Ancient Civilizations of Africa Vo. II, General History of Africa, UNESCO, p. 247. The A-Group culture vanished, followed later by the C-Group culture (2400–1550 BCE). Settlements consisted of round structures with stone floors. Structural frame was achieved with wooden or pliant materials. Mudbricks became the preferred building materials as settlements became larger. Graves were circular cylindrical superstructures made of stoned wall. The pit was filled with gravel and stones, and covered with dried mud roof or hay roof. Later, during the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt (circa 1650 to 1550 BCE), an adobe chapel was placed to the north of the grave. Graves were from El Ghaba, Kadero, Sayala, and various other sites in northern Sudan. Kerma The city of Kerma The C-Group culture was related to the Kerma Culture. Kerma was settled around 2400 BCE. It was a walled city containing a religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well laid out roads. On the East side of the city, a funerary temple and chapel were laid out. It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most enduring structures was the deffufa, a mud brick temple where ceremonies were performed on top.Bietak, Manfred. The C-Group culture and the Pan Grave culture . Cairo: Austrian Archaeological Institute The deffufa is a unique structure in Nubian architecture. Three known deffufas exist: the Western Deffufa at Kerma, an Eastern Deffufa, and a third, little-known deffufa. The Western Deffufa is . It is tall and comprises three stories. It was surrounded by a boundary wall. Inside were chambers connected by passageways.Clammer, Paul(2005). Bradt Travel Guide Sudan. Bradt Travel Guides, pp. 159,160, , . The Western Deffufa The Eastern Deffufa lies east of the Western Deffufa. The Eastern Deffufa is shorter than the Western Deffufa, just two stories high. It is considered a funerary chapel, being surrounded by 30,000 tumuli or graves. It has two columned halls. The walls are decorated with portraiture of animal in color schemes of red, blue, yellow, and black and stone laid floors. Exterior walls were layered with stone. The third deffufa is of similar structure as the Eastern Deffufa.http://www.ancientsudan.org/arthistory_01_kermatemples.htm The Kerma graves are distinct. They are circular pits covered with white or black pebbles in a circular mound. Four huge graves in the southern part of the site exist. They lie in rows surrounded by smaller graves. The diameter is , covered with circular mounds of white and black desert pebbles high. Underneath exists a complex structure. A pathway running along the diameter is laid with mud walls, supporting the above mound. The mud walls seemed to have been once decorated. The pathway goes to a chamber with a Nubian vault and a wooden door where the king is buried. The king's bed is elaborate with stone carved legs. The vaulted chamber lies in the center of the structure. It is estimated 300 humans and 1000 cattle were probably sacrificed with the king to accompany him in the after-life.Education Development Center, Inc. Kerma, the First Nubian City ,Nubianet . Kush and Napata Pyramids near Jebel Barkal Between 1500–1085 BCE, Egyptian conquest and domination of Nubia was achieved. This conquest brought about the Napatan Phase of Nubian history, the birth of the Kingdom of Kush. Kush was immensely influenced by Egypt and eventually conquered it. During this phase we see the building of numerous pyramids and temples. Of much spiritual significance to Nubian pharaohs was Jebel Barkal. Nubian pharaohs received legitimacy from the site. They held pharaonic coronation and consulted its oracle. It was thought to be the dwelling place of the deity Amun. Temples for Mut, Hathor, and Bes are also present. Thirteen temples and three palaces have been excavated. The city of Napata has not been fully excavated. Some of the temples were started by various pharaohs and were added on by succeeding pharaohs, beginning with Egyptian pharaohs. Reisner excavated Jebel Barkal, labeling its monuments B for Barkal. Some are as follows: B200 (temple of Taharqa), B300 (Taharqa's other temple of Mut, Hathor and Bes), B500 (temple of Amun), B501 (outer court), B502 (hypostyle hall), B700 (temple), B800sub (temple of Alara of Nubia), B1200 (palace).

More pyramids were constructed and for the longest time in Nubia than in Egypt. Nubia contains 223 pyramids. They were smaller than Egyptian pyramids. Nubian pyramids were for kings and queens. The general construction of Nubian pyramids consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a chamber access via the stairway.Kendall, Timothy. The 25th Dynasty .

It is located south from Jebel Barkal. It was made of sandstone. It range from in height. About ten pharaohs and fourteen queens were buried at El-Kurru. Nuri was another important pyramid site, 6 miles northeast of Jebel Barkal. It housed the tombs of twenty pharaohs and fifty four queens. The pharaoh's pyramids range from in height. The queen's pyramids are . The tombs were cut out of bedrock. The pharaoh's chamber contained three interconnecting chambers. The queen's contain two interconnecting chambers. Pyramids of Meroë Meroë The third Nubian Pyramid site, Meroë, is considered to be the largest archaeological site in the world. It contains more Nubian Pyramids than any other site. The ancient Nubians established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks. Many are located at the sites of Meroë. During the Meroitic period in Nubian history the ancient Nubians used a trigonometric methodology similar to the Egyptians. Christian Nubia The remains of the North Church in Old Dongola The Christianization of Nubia began in the 6th century AD. Its most representative architecture are churches. They are based on Byzantium basilicas. The structures are relatively small and made of mudbricks. The church is rectangular in shape with North and South isles. Columns are used to divide the nave. On the East side is the apse. The altar stood in front of the apse. The area between the altar and apse was called the haikal. At the West was a tower or upper room also in the South corner and North corner. Doors were in the North and South walls. A few churches such as Faras Cathedral survived. Church painting with biblical themes were extensive but few survived. The best surviving church painting were on the Rivergate Church of Faras and the Church of Ab El Qadir. Vernacular architecture of the Christian period is scarce. Architecture of Soba is the only one that has been excavated .

The mudbrick structure was revived by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy after rediscovering the technique in the Nubian village of Abu al-Riche. The technology is advocated by environmentalist as environmentally friendly and sustainable, since it makes use of pure earth without the need of timber.Swan, Simone. Elegant Solutions. Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1999, Volume 50, Number 4. Islamic Nubia The conversion to Islam was a slow, gradual process, with almost 600 years of resistance. Most of the architecture of the period are mosques built of mudbricks. One of the first attempt at conquest was by Egyptian-Nubian, Ibn Abi Sarh. Ibn Abi Sarh was a Muslim leader who tried to conquer all Nubia in the 8th century AD. It was almost a complete failure. A treaty called the Baqt shaped Egyptian-Nubian relations for six centuries and permitted the construction of a mosque in the Nubian capital of Old Dongola for Muslim travelers. By the middle of the 14th century, Nubia had been converted to Islam. The royal Church of Dongola was converted into a mosque. Numerous other churches were converted to mosque.Ismail Kamal Kushkush.

Samogitia was granted to the Teutonic Knights by Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, several times in order to enlist Knights' support for his other military affairs. The local population resisted Teutonic rule and asked Vytautas to protect them. The first uprising was unsuccessful and Vytautas had to reconfirm his previous promises to transfer Samogitia in the Peace of Raciąż. The second uprising provoked the Knights to declare war on Poland. Hostilities escalated and resulted in the Battle of Grunwald (1410), one of the biggest battles of medieval Europe. The Knights were soundly defeated by the joint Polish–Lithuanian forces, but Vytautas and Jogaila, King of Poland, were unable to capitalize on their victory. Conflicts regarding Samogitia, both diplomatic and military, dragged until the Treaty of Melno (1422). Background =Samogitia as an object of strategic interests= The Livonian Order was the first to attempt the conquest of Samogitia, but they were decisively defeated by the Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236 and had to become a branch of the Teutonic Order. Continued crusade brought little territorial gains. Samogitia was important to the Knights as it physically separated the Teutonic Knights in Prussia from its branch in Livonia. The first opportunity to acquire Samogitia came only in 1383 when Jogaila formulated the Treaty of Dubysa. The treaty awarded Samogitia up to the Dubysa River to the Knights for their support to Jogaila against Vytautas in the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84). However, it was not ratified and hostilities between Poland and the Knights broke out soon after. The Knights switched sides and now Vytautas granted Samogitia to the Knights twice – by the Treaty of Königsberg (1384) and Treaty of Lyck (1390). When Jogaila and Vytautas reconciled and broke those treaties, the Knights continued to wage a war against Samogitia and Lithuania. Eventually Vytautas agreed to the Treaty of Salynas, signed in October 1398, as he sought to stabilize the western front while preparing for a large expedition into east against the Golden Horde, resulting in the disastrous Battle of the Vorskla River. =Knights take control of Samogitia= According to the Treaty of Salynas, Samogitia was ceded to the Order and Vytautas agreed to help enforce the treaty. The Order attempted to take control of Samogitia: even if they had the legal title to the land, local population resisted Teutonic rule and had to be subdued. The Knights took 500 hostages into Prussia to discourage resistance, while loyal Samogitian nobles were rewarded with gifts (wool, salt, clothes). They also built two fortresses on the periphery of Samogitia – one with Vytautas's help near Nevėžis River and another (named Friedeburg) near the Dubysa River. Vytautas agreed to build the castle as compensation for two Teutonic fortresses he burnt during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–92). The Knights continued to organize destructive raids. In February 1399, Teutonic and Livonian forces raided central Samogitia and locals were unable to mount effective defense. In winter 1400, Vytautas assisted the Knights in one of such raids: Samogitians asked for his help and wanted to surrender to him, but he refused and continued to follow the treaty with the Knights. Unable to resist and with no help coming from Vytautas, Samogitians surrendered to the Knights for the first time. In the summer of 1400, the Teutonic Grandmaster sent Heinrich von Schwelborn to govern Samogitia from castles in Kaunas and Friedeburgh. The Knights tried to maintain friendly relationship with Vytautas: they warmly welcomed his wife Anna during her pilgrimage to the tomb of Dorothy of Montau and sent him gifts. However, soon disagreements arose when the Order demanded to return about 4,000 peasants who escaped into Lithuania. Vytautas argued that they were free people and had the right to choose where to live. The disagreement was not resolved via diplomatic means and grew into a war. First uprising The fighting started on March 13, 1401, after the Union of Vilnius and Radom was ratified by Polish nobles in March assuring Vytautas of Polish support. Samogitians organized a local rebellion, capturing and burning the two newly built castles. The Teutonic soldiers were taken captives to exchange them for Samogitian hostages taken into Prussia. In fall 1401, the Knights raided Kaunas and Hrodna. Up to this point Vytautas did not officially support the rebels; the Knights suspected Vytautas was behind the uprising, but they were careful not to anger Vytautas and not to push him into a closer alliance with Jogaila. Jogaila's brother Švitrigaila joined the war in January 1402 on the side of the Teutonic Knights as he laid claims to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He confirmed the Treaty of Salynas in exchange for Order's military assistance and drew Vytautas into open war against the Knights. In May 1402, Samogitians burned Memel (now Klaipėda). Vytautas joined the fight in 1402 by attacking Gotteswerder. The fortress surrendered after a three-day siege. In July, Švitrigaila lead the Knight's army south of Vilnius (Medininkai, Ashmyany, Šalčininkai) hoping to capture the capital city. These were the last Teutonic raids into the Lithuania proper. In April 1403, Lithuanians and Samogitians responded by raiding Dünaburg in Livonia. The Teutonic Knights also waged a propaganda war by sending multiple complaints to the Pope, church officials, and western rulers. They accused Vytautas of triple treachery for breaking treaties of 1384, 1390, and 1398. Vytautas responded that while Samogitia was ruled by a military order, established to spread Christianity, Samogitians were not yet baptized. Pope Boniface IX issued an edict prohibiting the Knights to attack Lithuania. When neither side could achieve decisive victory and Vytautas wished to concentrate his attention to troubles in Smolensk, both sides started negotiations in summer 1403. A temporary truce was signed in December and the Peace of Raciąż was concluded on May 22, 1404. In essence it confirmed the Treaty of Salynas. Vytautas agreed to transfer Samogitia and assist the Knight in subduing any rebellious residents. He also agreed not to accept any Samogitian families that might escape into Lithuania. In 1405 Vytautas put his words into action and helped the Knights to take control of environs of Raseiniai, Viduklė, Ariogala. Interim peace The Knights took control of Samogitia and began rebuilding old and building new castles along the rivers. Königsburg was built on the Šušvė River near Josvainiai. Vytautas provided the manpower for construction, food, guns, and even garrison. The castle was manned by 40 Teutons and 400 Poles. The Samogitians unsuccessfully attacked the newly built castle in fall 1405. Other castles were built in Christmemel and rebuilt in Friedeburgh. Dobesinburg, completed in 1407 near the mouth of Dubysa, was to become the new capital of the region. The Knights attempted to implement their administrative system: they measured land, counted residents, appointed local officers, and sent their own colonists. They promoted the three-field crop rotation, which had potential of higher outputs but would eventually lead to higher taxes and serfdom. When Vytautas attempted to introduce similar reforms a decade later, he too faced resistance and revolts. Despite the reforms, there were no significant efforts to convert the pagan Samogitians into Christianity. Hundreds of Samogitians were taken as hostages into Prussia. Rebellious residents were punished and executed, while those who swore loyalty were awarded with expensive gifts. In a complaint submitted to the Council of Constance in 1417, the Samogitians listed many crimes and injustices perpetrated by the Knights. The Knights assisted Vytautas in his campaigns in Pskov, Veliky Novgorod, and Moscow. However, the friendly relationship between Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights was somewhat strained after election of Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen, who was less inclined to ally with Lithuania. Second uprising =Local rebellion= At the end of 1408, when Vytautas was finished with his campaigns in the east, tensions rose between him and the Knights. In late 1408, Vytautas and Jogaila met in Navahrudak and agreed to support the Samogitians and provoke the Knights into declaring war against Poland. Poland had its own territorial quarrels with the Knights over the Dobrzyń Land and wanted to diminish Prussian influence in Lithuania while preserving the Polish–Lithuanian union. Samogitians, angered by a famine in 1408, rose again on May 26, 1409. They succeeded in taking and burning Christmemel, Friedeburgh, Dobesinburg; only Memel withstood the attacks. While Vytautas secretly supported Samogitians, officially he still adhered to the Peace of Raciąż. Vytautas openly rose against the Knights only in the summer of 1409 after the Knights arrested 20 ships loaded with grain sent by Jogaila from Thorn to relieve the famine. The incident highlighted importance of controlling trade in the Nemunas Delta. Vytautas sent his deputies (Rumbaudas Valimantaitis, Galminas, Getautas, Klausigaila, and Vasibutas) to command the rebellious forces. As uprising took over the entire region, Teutonic forces evacuated into Prussia. Švitrigaila once again allied with the Knights hoping to overthrow Vytautas and become the Grand Duke but he was arrested and imprisoned. =Escalation into regional war= When the Knights threatened that they would invade Lithuania, Poland, through archbishop Mikołaj Kurowski, declared its support to the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. In August 1409, the Knights declared war against Poland, which began the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania one by one and first invaded Poland. Wenceslaus, King of the Romans agreed to mediate the dispute and a truce was signed on September 8, 1409. Until it expired on June 24, 1410, both Lithuania and Poland were at peace. The Knights sought to break apart the Polish–Lithuanian union and Vytautas was even offered the crown of King of Lithuania. While all parties presented their arguments to the mediator, Vytautas and Jogaila agreed to a joint military campaign, which was executed in summer 1410. The joint Polish–Lithuanian forces soundly defeated the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald, one of the biggest battles in medieval Europe. However, the cousins were not able to take advantage of the victory and did not capture much territory. The Peace of Thorn was signed in 1411. Samogitia was granted to Lithuania, but only for the lifetimes of Vytautas and Jogaila. It took two other brief wars, the Hunger War (1414) and Gollub War (1422), to sign the Treaty of Melno which resolved the dispute, assigning Samogitia to Lithuania.

Reception Scott Yanow of Allmusic stated \\"This LP pairs trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and tenor-saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, two very individual players who always brought out the best in each other. They stretch out on long versions of \\"Povo\\" and \\"Gibraltar\\" that clock in around 19 minutes apiece. The backup rhythm section (guitarist Eric Gale, keyboardist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Jack DeJohnette) is a major asset and inspires the two horns to play reasonably creative solos.\\" Syd Fablo of Rock Salted wrote \\"A really, really good — if strangely overlooked — live jazz fusion album, comparable to Cannonball Adderley‘s The Black Messiah and Donald Byrd‘s Ethiopian Knights, which is to say this is not formally or stylistically innovative but everybody involved delivers superb performances with a focus on warmth and heart. There also is an equally good Volume Two, on which Herbie Hancock shares top billing — strangely, because he plays on both volumes, but also not so strangely given the commonalities this music shares with his own Mwandishi group. As fusion was starting to drift into bland mediocrity, this is something else entirely, a vibrant, energetic and likable rock-inflected electric jazz performance that sidesteps the sort of pandering that usually goes hand-in-hand with fusion from this point onward. There are overt signs of structure, and efforts to make the performances sound proper and professional, but there is always a hint of something unruly and dangerous lurking behind every note. It is that sense of double meaning that makes this more than just a funky good time (which it also is).\\" Track listing :All compositions by Freddie Hubbard # \\"Povo\\" - 19:23 # \\"Gibraltar\\" - 19:19 \\"Gibraltar\\" was recorded March 3, 1973 at the Chicago Opera House. \\"Povo\\" was recorded March 4, 1973 at the Ford Auditorium in Detroit.

She was launched on 11 September 1901 as the second of three s. Along with her sister ships, she participated at the bombardment of Ancona during World War I. Due to a shortage of coal, she was soon decommissioned after the bombardment of Ancona and used as harbor defense ship for the remainder of the war. After the war, all of the Habsburg-class battleships were ceded to Great Britain as war prizes. She was scrapped in Italy in 1921.  Construction and layout  Árpád was the second of three battleships of her class. Her hull was laid down on 10 June 1899 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste. Following more than two years of construction, she was launched on 11 September 1901. After final fitting-out work was finished, Árpád was fully ready for service and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 15 June 1903. Line-drawing of the Habsburg-class ships; shaded areas show the extent of the armor layout Like all ships of her class, Árpád was long at the waterline and was in overall length. She had a beam of and a draft of . Freeboard was approximately forward and about aft. She also displaced . Once construction on her had finished and she was commissioned into the Navy, Árpád had a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men. Árpád was powered by 2-shaft, 4-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines, which were supplied with steam by 16 Belleville boilers. Árpáds power output was rated at , which produced a top speed of . The hull for the ship was constructed from longitudinal and transverse steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted into place. The hull incorporated a double bottom that ran for 63% of the ship's length. A series of watertight bulkheads also extended from the keel to the gun deck. All in all, there was a total of 174 watertight compartments in the ship. Árpád had a metacentric height of between and . Bilge keels were mounted on either side of the hull to reduce rolling and prevent her from capsizing. Árpád had a flush main deck that was planked with wood, while the upper decks were covered with linoleum or corticine. Árpád had three L/40 guns, two mounted in a twin turret forward and one mounted in a single turret aft of the main superstructure. The C 97-type guns were manufactured by Krupp in Germany. The main guns fired at a rate of between three and four armor-piercing (AP) shells per minute. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/40 guns in casemates. These guns could fire at 4–5 shells per minute. She was built with face-hardened chrome- nickel steel. The main armored belt was in the central portion of the ship, where the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other critical areas were located. The belt tapered slightly to on either end of the central section.  Service history  = Peacetime = 1:50 scale model of Árpád Árpád took part in her first fleet maneuvers in mid-1903 with her sister ship Habsburg. The third sister, Babenberg, was commissioned in Summer 1904, and participated in successive fleet drills. Following a series of simulated war games pitting Árpád and her sister ships against the three battleships, Árpád and the other two Habsburg-class ships became the I Battleship Division. This new division was active in the Mediterranean region. When Habsburg underwent a training cruise with the three Monarch-class battleships in January 1903, Árpád joined her the next year in a voyage around the Mediterranean Sea. With the commissioning of the s in 1906 and 1907, the Habsburg-class ships were transferred from the I to the II Battleship Division, and the three Monarch- class battleships were moved from the II to the III Battleship Division. In 1910–1911, Árpád had one of her superstructure decks removed to reduce weight. = World War I = Early in World War I, Árpád was transferred to the Austro- Hungarian Navy's IV Division after the first new s came into service. At around the same time, Árpád, her sister ships and and the remainder of the Austro-Hungarian Navy were mobilized to support the flight of and from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German ships were stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British vessels. After breaking out, the German ships planned to steam to Turkey. After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was recalled. The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern coast of Italy. After Italy entered the war on the side of France and Great Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Navy bombarded several Italian port cities along the Adriatic coast. Árpád took part in the Bombardment of Ancona on 23 May 1915. Due to a coal shortage, Árpád was later decommissioned and re-purposed as a harbor defense ship for the latter half of the war. Árpáds crew was transferred to man the new U-boats and aircraft. Following the war, Árpád, along with her sister ships, were awarded to Great Britain as war prizes. They were sold to Italy and broken up for scrap in 1921.

The Australian government had closely followed events in Cambodia given the possible implications for regional security, while out of a desire to be seen as a good international citizen it had also invested heavily diplomatically in order to push the parties towards a peace agreement. In August 1989 the UN attempted to broker a peace agreement between the warring factions, and included amongst the reconnaissance party were two Australian officers tasked with laying the groundwork for a monitoring force should it be deployed. However, after the collapse of the peace effort the proposed UN force was cancelled and the reconnaissance team withdrawn. Two years later, however, following the Paris Agreements in 1991 UNTAC was successfully established to monitor a new ceasefire and elections which were initially planned for March 1992.Grey 1999, pp. 259–260. UNTAC was the largest and most complex UN operation since the Congo in the 1960s, comprising 16,000 troops, 900 military observers, 3,350 civilian police and several thousand civilian staff.Londey 2004, p. 170. The Australian contingent served from the inception of the mission in late 1991 until it withdrew in November 1993, and at its height numbered 600 personnel. Approximately 1,215 Australians served in Cambodia, and although they suffered a number of casualties, none were killed during the mission.Londey 2004, p. 174. UNAMIC The Australian contribution initially included an advance party of 65 communications personnel under the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC). The first 40 signallers arrived in Phnom Penh on 10 November 1991, the day after UNAMIC headquarters opened. They were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Stuart, who became the mission's first casualty on 26 February 1992 when he was wounded after the helicopter he was travelling in was hit by ground fire close to the Thai border. Later the commitment was increased to 65 signallers.Londey 2004, p. 16. UNTAC Australian Army Patch - UNTAC The ADF ultimately contributed a force of 600 personnel to UNTAC, including 488 in the Force Communications Unit (FCU), which was tasked with providing communications infrastructure—including HF radio, telex, telephone, courier services and data transfer—for the mission across fifty-six locations throughout the country. The first rotation of the FCU was composed largely of Army signallers from 2 Signals Regiment and was commanded Lieutenant Colonel Steve Ayling. Later the FCU was made up of signallers from the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy, as well as 40 New Zealanders; Ayling was subsequently succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Marty Studdert. A thirty-man movement control unit and a twenty-man military police unit were subsequently added later. Whilst a ten-man Australian Federal Police (AFP) was also provided to assist in the restoration of law and order. A further 115 personnel, comprising six S-70A Blackhawk helicopters and their crews drawn from 5th Aviation Regiment, as well as a small number of infantry from 2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2/4 RAR), were deployed from May–July 1993. During the election itself the Australian Electoral Commission provided 50 staff to assist with voter registration. Initially it had been suggested by the Australian Minister for Defence, Robert Ray, that Australia would provide up to 1,300 personnel to UNTAC when it took over—including an engineering squadron—however by the time the UN formally made its request in February 1992 the offer was reduced to 550.Londey 2004, p. 173. UNTAC subsequently took over in May and the main body of Australian personnel arrived in Phnom Penh in April–June 1992, taking over a large disused barracks as their base—dubbed Pteah Australii or \\"home of the Australians\\". Australian personnel deployed to Cambodia served tours of varying length, between five and thirteen months long, whilst some officers serving in UNTAC headquarters served even longer. Australia also provided the force commander, Lieutenant General John Sanderson, being only the second occasion in which Australia provided the commander of a UN mission. Sanderson's task was a difficult one, as not only did the Khmer Rouge attempt to disrupt the mission, the troops under his command also proved hard to manage. Indeed, at one time Sanderson even faced death threats from a number of members of the Bulgarian contingent over pay and conditions.Londey 2004, pp. 172–173. As the mission progressed the dangers increased, with the Khmer Rouge attacking UNTAC personnel on a number of occasions, and killing a group of Bulgarian soldiers, as well as a Japanese electoral worker and his interpreter.Londey 2004, p. 176. The Australian contingent, consisting mainly of support troops, saw little action in the traditional sense, although it too had to face its share of danger. On at least one occasion infantry from 2/4 RAR had to defend themselves after becoming involved in a night-time contact at the helicopter base at Battambang after a Mi-26 heavy lift helicopter received ground fire when returning to land. A number of individuals in the FCU—often deployed in small groups in isolated parts of the country as they were—also had lucky escapes after being caught in contacts between warring factions, in artillery barrages and even being taken hostage by the Khmer Rouge.For these incidents see Horner 2001, pp. 239–240 and Londey 2004, p. 177. Withdrawal By mid-1993 the refugee camps along the Thai border had been closed and more the 337,000 displaced persons resettled, most eligible voters had been registered, more than 250,000 former soldiers disarmed and a program of demining initiated. UNTAC had also successfully extended its security umbrella through widespread patrolling, the confiscation of weapons and other measures to reduce banditry, whilst the Khmer Rouge had also been sidelined, even if it continued to poss a threat. The elections were successfully held between 23–28 May 1993, and by November 1993 the United Nations withdrew from Cambodia altogether. Arguably the mission to Cambodia represented a significant change in Australian thinking towards peacekeeping, and its level of commitment.Londey 2004, p. 165. Previously, although a frequent contributor to UN operations, Australia had contributed small numbers of individual personnel to fill technical positions (e.g. signals, engineers or medical personnel) or as observers, however in Cambodia the ADF deployed a significant sized force, albeit again providing higher level technically qualified personnel and support staff, rather than combat troops. This approach however, placed significant strain on the ADF, with the mission denuding it of the bulk of its communications specialists.Grey 1999, p. 259. Subsequently Australia became increasingly involved in UN peacekeeping operations throughout the mid-1990s, deploying significant forces—including combat troops—to Somalia and Rwanda, and later still to East Timor. Approximately 1,215 Australians served in Cambodia, and although they suffered a number of casualties, none were killed during the mission.Londey 2004, p. 177.

It is the second novel in the Cadfael Chronicles, first published in 1979 (1979 in literature). It was adapted for television in 1994 by Central for ITV. In the Anarchy, King Stephen takes Shrewsbury Castle, punishing the rebels. A murdered man is found among the dead rebels, a mystery for Brother Cadfael to solve, while two young men vie to be the Deputy Sheriff and vie for the lady's hand. When the novel was first published, the author was remarked for her knowledge of the historical era and ability to create it for the reader, yet \\"she never lets the meticulously researched place-and-time interfere with the canny puzzle, the flesh-and-blood characterization, or the sharp tension.\\" Plot summary In August 1138, King Stephen is besieging rebels now loyal to Empress Matilda in Shrewsbury Castle. Brother Cadfael welcomes the assistance of young Godric, brought to the Abbey by his aunt. Cadfael recognises that Godric is a girl. She is Godith Adeney, daughter of Fulke Adeney, a rebel leader inside the castle. Cadfael agrees to keep her secret, thus beginning 10 adventurous days. Aline Siward and Hugh Beringar enter King Stephen's camp to pledge their loyalty. The King welcomes Aline Siward even though her absent brother Giles has declared for the Empress. He treats Hugh Beringar with more reserve, as he was betrothed as a child to Godith. To prove his loyalty, he is asked to find Godith and deliver her to the King. Beringar and Adam Courcelle, designated Deputy Sheriff once the castle falls, both fall for Aline on first sight. The castle falls the next morning, but FitzAlan and Adeney escape. Infuriated, King Stephen orders the ninety-four survivors of the turncoat garrison executed that very afternoon. Abbot Heribert of Shrewsbury Abbey offers to give Christian burial to the victims; King Stephen assents. Counting the bodies, Cadfael finds not ninety- four, but ninety-five – one corpse too many. The extra corpse did not die by hanging, but by strangulation. Aline finds the body of her brother Giles among the ninety-four. Very upset, Courcelle gives Aline her brother's cloak. Later, Godric/Godith identifies the murdered man as Nicholas Faintree, a squire of FitzAlan. Cadfael visits Godith's old nurse, Petronilla Flesher for news. FitzAlan ordered squires Faintree and Torold Blund to slip out of the castle to take his treasury to safety in Wales, then to Normandy. She tells Cadfael that Beringar asked after Godith the day of the hangings, which means Beringar knows of the treasure. Working in the corn harvest, Godric encounters a wounded man, Torold Blund. He relates how he and Faintree tried to carry FitzAlan's treasure as ordered. Faintree's horse was lamed by a caltrop, planted on the forested track not far from Frankwell. Faintree waited at a forest hut while Blund fetched a fresh horse. When Blund returned he found Faintree dead. Blund was attacked by a stranger, but escaped from him. Blund was blocked by the King's men on every road to Wales. He jumped into the river Severn in a hail of arrows, letting the horses go free. He hid the treasure under the bridge near the castle, hoping the soldiers took him for drowned. Cadfael retraces Blund's path. In the hut, he finds a yellow topaz meant as decoration to a dagger in the dirt floor. Cadfael sends Godric with food and medicine to Blund, who is much recovered. Blund discovers that she is a girl named Godith. Cadfael joins them. He agrees to help them escape to Wales with the treasure. He and Blund hear footsteps, so stop their conversation. Later, Beringar asks Cadfael where he can conceal his two most valuable mounts before King Stephen raids for supplies. They take the horses to a grange belonging to the Abbey, south of Shrewsbury. Cadfael sees that Hugh Beringar has a spirit like his own as to the cause of justice and a clever mind for pursuing it. He spends the next day testing his theory that Hugh is following him. Cadfael locates the treasure hidden in the river. He has a bundle matching it in appearance, which he carries to the grange. Once Beringar is away from the river, Godith and Blund fetch the treasure to a safe place. Sheriff Prestcote begins the raids before Cadfael wakes. Godith wakes early, ensuring her own safety and that of the treasure. Aline tells Cadfael that Godric is safe with her. Blund spends the day on the run. He thinks, correctly, that Beringar saw him, yet did not seize him. That night, Cadfael, Blund and Godith walk to the grange with the treasure. They hide the treasure in a tree that will be on the road to Wales, then swing back to approach the grange on the usual path. At the grange, Beringar and his men stop them. Beringar means to aid Godith in her escape, as his duty of honour. He wants the treasure for the King. Godith and Blund depart for Wales on Beringar's horses, pleased with Cadfael's success. At Cadfael's workshop, Beringar finds the saddlebags filled with stones not treasure. He is mystified that they also contain Faintree's old clothes and the jewel from the dagger. Cadfael is thus satisfied Beringar had no part in Faintree's murder. Beringar laughs that Cadfael won the game, keeping the treasure with Godith. The two co-operate now. A beggar tells Cadfael events seen the night before the castle fell: Giles Siward slipped into the siege camp and betrayed FitzAlan's plan to the officer of the watch, Courcelle, in exchange for his life. Courcelle breaks the bargain, and then steals the dagger from Giles's corpse. Then Courcelle left the castle, to lay the trap for Faintree and Blund, seeking the treasure for himself. He fought with Blund in the hut. Beringar recalls Aline's mention of the family heirloom dagger lost when Giles was hanged. They conclude the murderer has the rest of the dagger. Cadfael attends the farewell banquet for the King as servant to the Abbot. He sees a kitchen boy eating his own meal with Giles' missing dagger, fished from the Severn. At this banquet, Beringar accuses Courcelle of the murder of Faintree and the theft of the dagger, staking his life. He tosses the yellow topaz on the table. Cadfael gives the dagger to the King, who fits the two together, completing the proof. The boy identifies Courcelle. Courcelle denies all. The King is eager for justice, and impatient to move on. Instead of a trial, this will be settled by trial by combat, à l'outrance. The lengthy combat between Beringar and Courcelle begins. Aline arrives knowing she loves Hugh Beringar. In close fighting, Courcelle falls on his own dagger blade and dies. With Beringar vindicated by fate, King Stephen appoints him Deputy Sheriff of Shropshire in Courcelle's place. He and Aline are betrothed. Cadfael, now his firm friend, gives him Giles's dagger, which has been restored by craftsmen at the Abbey, for Aline. Cadfael resolves to pray both for Nicholas Faintree, \\"a clean young man of mind and life\\", and for Adam Courcelle, \\"dead in his guilt\\", because \\"every untimely death, every man cut down in his vigour and strength without time for repentance and reparation, is one corpse too many.\\" Characters *Brother Cadfael: He is 58 years old, and a Benedictine monk at Shrewsbury Abbey since age 40. He is the herbalist after his life as man at arms and sailor in the Middle East. His Welsh ancestry is given as Cadfael ap Meilyr ap Dafydd (Cadfael son of Meilyr son of Dafydd). Born in 1080 in North Wales. *Hugh Beringar: Chooses to be a loyal servant to King Stephen, about 23 years old, as he recently came into his manors at Maesbury. He is of a height with Cadfael, but lithe and wiry in appearance. He is of the local landed aristocracy and a man of honour, who can muster six knights and some fifty men-at-arms, half of them skilled bowmen for the King. Hugh was engaged to Godith Adeney as part of an arranged marriage when he was a child. His family associated closely with FitzAlan and Adeney before the two chose to support the Empress Matilda in the Anarchy. Young, ambitious, confident and intelligent, he hopes to capture FitzAlan's treasury and use it to ingratiate himself with the King. In the process Beringar proves a capable rival to Cadfael, before allying with him. He is appointed Deputy Sheriff of Shropshire at the end of the story. He is attracted to Aline Siward. *Aline Siward: Recently orphaned young woman of rank, daughter of a supporter of King Stephen. Aline visits King Stephen at his camp to pledge her loyalty by bringing keys to her manors, which the King accepts. Her household can raise five knights, and more than forty men-at-arms for the King. This moment in her life is when she shows her own strength and makes her choices for her future. Pursued by two handsome young men in the King's camp, Adam Courcelle and Hugh Beringar. She is about 19 years old. *Giles Siward: Brother of Aline, five years older than her at age 24, who broke with the family to support Empress Maud some time ago. At the start of the story, Aline does not know where her brother is, with fighting in many places. *Father Elias: The priest of Saint Alkmond's parish in Shrewsbury, where Aline's family has a burial vault. *King Stephen: King Stephen is a historical figure. He took the castle of Shrewsbury, which had been held by his own deputy William FitzAlan, also a historical figure. Because he defeated turncoats, King Stephen ordered the 94 survivors to be hanged, starting with FitzAlan's uncle, Arnulf of Hesdin. In the novel, the many sides of King Stephen are developed: effective in battle, uninterested in administration, charming with people. *Gilbert Prestcote: Knight in service to King Stephen, about 50 years old. Involved in the hangings, and then deals with Cadfael over the murdered man among them. Chosen as Sheriff by the King to replace the turncoat FitzAlan. *Willem Ten Heyt: Captain of the Flemish soldiers serving King Stephen in this battle; his men are needed because Stephen cannot raise enough local men-at-arm and knights to succeed in the four-week battle. He relayed the order of the hangings of the traitors, per orders given him. *Abbot Heribert: Head of the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul from 1127 to 1138. His \\"anxious sweetness\\" is a contrast to his proud and ambitious subordinate, Prior Robert Pennant. Heribert appeals to King Stephen to permit the Christian burial of the rebels who defended the castle then assigns Cadfael to the task. Heribert is inclined to lenience and humility, and is a peace-loving man. He knows he is \\"in disfavour with the king, like all those who had been slow to rally to him with vociferous support.\\" For the request to bury the hanged traitors, \\"the king would perhaps never forgive Abbot Heribert for the implied reproach, and the reminder of his Christian duty.\\" *Adam Courcelle: Right-hand man and tenant to Gilbert Prestcote, and a supporter of King Stephen in the siege of Shrewsbury, designated to be deputy Sheriff upon victory. He is a hopeful suitor of Aline Siward. He is thirty years old, experienced at war, and treachery. *Godith Adeley: Seventeen-year-old daughter of Fulke Adeley, second in command to William FitzAlan. Caught by the rapid defeat, she disguised herself as a boy and was brought to the Abbey to help Brother Cadfael as Godric. She maintains her disguise for 8 days. *Brother Paul: Abbey monk responsible for teaching the lay students and novices, including Godric. *Edric Flesher: Chief of the butcher's guild in Shrewsbury, husband to Petronilla late in life, and supporter of Fulke Adeley. *Petronilla: Now wife of Edric Flesher. Earlier in life, she was nurse to Godith Adeley. *Torold Blund: Young squire of William FitzAlan, one of two assigned to carry Adeley's fortune out of England and take Adeley's daughter to safety. Torold, of Saxon heritage and name, was both neighbour and friend of Nicholas Faintree, both the same age. Brother Cadfael gives him the last memento of his own military life, kept these many years, his poniard. *Nicholas Faintree: Young squire of William FitzAlan, usually carried messages further north in the county, well known to the Adeley family. His is the one corpse too many, as identified by Godric/Godith after the corpse is brought to the Abbey church. The cause of justice for his death is taken up by Brother Cadfael and later by his new confederate. *Ulf: Distant kin to Torold Blund with a holding near the hut where he and his friend encountered the caltrops on the path. Cadfael seeks him out to learn more of the truth of the events in the hut, especially the caltrops. *Bishop Roger of Salisbury: Justiciar for King Stephen, he rejoins the King when he took over Shrewsbury Castle for a few days after taking it, and is present at the large dinner held by the King. Real historical person, whose major role was in the time of old King Henry, but gave rise to some of King Stephen's problems with the clergy early in his reign. Three of his nephews joined the clergy, including Nigel, bishop of Ely. *Lame Osbern: Disfigured beggar who sets up at King Stephen's camp for the warmth of the fires and hope of alms, then follows him to the castle. Brother Cadfael selects him to receive as alms the cape of Aline's dead brother; this connection is key to learning one essential clue to both the death of Giles and the murder of Nicholas Faintree. *Anselm and Louis: Lay brothers who stay at the grange, an outlying holding of the Abbey, with stables. It is an assart in the forest to the west of Shrewsbury proper and lately not much used. They are strong men who carry weapons. Themes The quality of loyalty to a cause or a person is a recurring theme throughout the work, as characters declare their loyalty to a cause or person only for that loyalty to be tested, sometimes to breaking point. The novel begins with a triple betrayal: Giles Siward betrays the cause of Empress Maud, the plans of his lord FitzAlan and the two squires entrusted with the treasury, to King Stephen's sheriff, Courcelle. Courcelle then betrays the cause of King Stephen and Giles Siward out of greed. The contrast between justice and expedience is another theme explored at the beginning and end of the novel, with King Stephen's expedient justice in war time treading a difficult line between both. Yet the King's desire to move on does reveal the better man for his cause, and allow his newest adherent to prove his loyalty to the King while following his notions of honour and justice. Setting in history The story takes place during The Anarchy, a term referring to the 19-year civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, from 1135 to 1153. King Stephen, William Fitz-Alan, his uncle Arnulf of Hesdin, Abbot Heribert, and Prior Robert Pennant are all real people. Son of Alan fitz Flaad, baron of Oswestry, William FitzAlan was appointed Sheriff in 1137 by King Stephen. Fitz-Alan did go over to the Empress Matilda and held Shrewsbury Castle in her name. There was a battle lasting four weeks in July and August, during which Arnulf hurled much verbal abuse of the attacking King Stephen, and which Stephen won. Stephen indeed hanged all the defenders of the castle after taking it, save William who had escaped before Stephen's final success. Wales is a preferred escape route from Shropshire and environs to France in the time of Anarchy, as the prince of Gwynedd, the principality of northern Wales, takes no side in the conflict and is pleased to have the English fighting each other, and not him. Fitz-Alan, with roots in that border area, had a relationship with Owain Gwynedd so he or his messengers could ask for the prince's protection to ride across to a port and seek ship for Normandy. Trial by combat, used at the end to settle the guilt of Courcelle on one count of murder and another of theft not fit for an officer and gentleman, was used in England in the Middle Ages, especially from the time of the Norman conquest to the reign of King Henry II, who introduced a more efficient system of jury trials, but extending to the 16th century. When King Stephen uttered \\"à l'outrance\\", he meant the combat had to be to the death of one of the two. The phrase means to the uttermost in some usages, but to the death in this usage. In the novel, the body of a murdered man is slipped in among the bodies of the executed defenders; hence, there is one corpse too many. The story takes place in Shropshire (also called Salop) in England. The Shrewsbury Abbey and its outlying grange, the real town of Shrewsbury and its suburb Frankwell on the road to Wales are the locations for most of the story's action. Critical reception Kirkus Reviews finds the author has improved on the first book with this novel: > A second, even smoother medieval adventure for Brother Cadfael (A Morbid > Taste for Bones)—once a Crusader and man of the world, now an accomplished > herbalist at the monastery in 12th-century Shrewsbury, a town racked by > civil war. King Stephen has conquered, his enemies have all been massacred, > but—while preparing these nameless bodies for Christian burial—Cadfael finds > one to be the victim of a more personal sort of murder. So he tries to > identify both victim and murderer... while aiding two heroic young people on > the lam. And his ambivalent cohort in detection is valiant Hugh Beringar, > whose hand-to-hand combat with the murderer wraps things up with a zing. > Peters (who writes full-blown historicals as Edith Pargeter) makes the most > of the medieval atmosphere, but she never lets the meticulously researched > place-and-time interfere with the canny puzzle, the flesh-and-blood > characterization, or the sharp tension. A must for fans of mysteries in > period settings—and good enough to win over a few who've previously shied > away from that delicate subgenre.

Characters Firebrand as he appears in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. *Arthur: A knight in the service of princess Prin-Prin. Arthur is the primary protagonist of the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. The usage of the name Arthur is an allusion to King Arthur of Arthurian Legend. *Prin-Prin: Princess Prin-Prin is the ruler of the human realm—Ghouls 'n Ghosts specifies the Kingdom of Hus—and the last human with royal blood. She serves as the primary foil of the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. Astaroth kidnaps her in order to use her royal blood to invade the human realm. Although always referred to as Prin- Prin in Japan, she has been called both Prin-Prin and Guinevere in the various American releases. The usage of Guinevere is an allusion to Guinevere of Arthurian Legend. *Satan: A red beast who appears in both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts to kidnap Princess Prin Prin for the current demon lord, but is only fought in Ghosts 'n Goblins. He is extremely cunning and sets up traps for Arthur in the first game. A similar character appears in the Gargoyle's Quest II called Malgor in the English translation, but he is known as Skull Satan in Japan, implying they're the same character. In the game he is impersonating King Darkoan for Breager, he impersonated Darkoan almost perfectly, showing his cunning nature, however Firebrand saw through his disguise and defeated Malgor. *Astaroth: A demon king and the primary antagonist of the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. When near death he transforms into the undead demon king Nebiroth, a separate entity and personality from Astaroth. The name Astaroth is an allusion to the Astaroth found in medieval demonology. *Lucifer: Also known as Rushifell in Gargoyle's Quest and Gargoyle's Quest II, and alternatively referred to as Loki in the Sega Genesis version of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Lucifer is an extremely powerful noble in the demon realm and serves as the end-game boss Ghouls 'n Ghosts. In the Gargoyle's Quest series he functions as both a rival and assisting character, testing and then aiding Firebrand in reaching his full potential. *Sardius: Known as Samael in Japan, he is the primary demon antagonist and end-boss from Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts. *Hades: The Lord of Darkness who governs the Demon World in Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins. He had orchestrated his scheme carefully after watching the rise and fall of his 'predecessors: Astaroth, Lucifer, and Sardius. Hades sought two goals in his invasion of the Human Realm - The first was to use the Prin Prin's to create a mixed-blood union between Humans and Demons, giving the demons dominance over the humans. The second is the destruction of the Demon Realm's most hated enemy, Arthur. He plots his scheme, with Astaroth serving as his lieutenant and the Black Palace as his stronghold. *Lancelot: One of Arthur's knights with a unique jump attack. He is kidnapped and brainwashed to fight Arthur. The usage of the name Lancelot is an allusion to Lancelot of Arthurian Legend. *Perceval: One of Arthur's knights and a powerful short-range fighter with a unique dash attack. The usage of the name Perceval is an allusion to Perceval of Arthurian Legend. *Firebrand: Known as The Red Arremer in Japan, Firebrand is the primary protagonist of the Gargoyle's Quest series. He belongs to a race of gargoyled demons known as the Red Arremer Tribe, considered the elite warriors of the demon king Astaroth. He is considered a hero among his peers, and as such he has been nicknamed Red Blaze (a title shared with his ancestor in Gargoyle's Quest II, also named Firebrand) due to his bright red skin and prowess with fiery magic. The Red Arremer tribe appears as standard enemies in the main Ghosts 'n Goblins series, while a fiery blue silhouette of a Red Arremer serves as the series' logo. *Breager: An evil conqueror from another dimension that serves as the primary antagonist in Gargoyle's Quest. Firebrand is sent to destroy Breager and save the Demon Realm. In the prequel game Gargoyle's Quest II, Breager also attempted to conquer the Demon Realm but was defeated by Firebrand's ancestor. *Phalanx: A rival demon to Firebrand and the primary antagonist of Demon's Crest. Using the power of magical Crests that he stole from Firebrand, he rules and oppresses the Demon Realm. His chief general is Arma, who confronts Firebrand multiple times during his quest to destroy Phalanx. *Maximo: The primary protagonist of the Maximo series. Maximo is a king who is slain by his adviser Achille. He strikes a deal with Grimm, the grim reaper, in order to rescue his betrothed, Sophia. *Grimm: The grim reaper who frees Maximo from limbo and aids him on his journey in exchange for killing Achille. *Sophia: The primary foil of the Maximo series. Sophia is Maximo's betrothed, kidnapped at the beginning of Maximo: Ghosts to Glory. Development The Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise was created by Tokuro Fujiwara (also known for producing games in the Mega Man franchise) and is produced by Capcom. Toshio Arima served as lead programmer and Ayako Mori composed the score for the original arcade release in 1985. Soundtrack The original score for the initial arcade release of Ghosts 'n Goblins was composed by Ayako Mori. The music developed for the game's first level, entitled \\"Graveyard, Forest & Ice Palace,\\" has since become recognized as the official theme for the franchise, appearing in a re-mixed form in every entry of the main series as well as making cameo appearances in other Capcom games such as Mega Man 7 and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Tamayo Kawamoto composed the score for Ghouls 'n Ghosts, the next entry in the series, followed by Mari Yamaguchi for Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts (with Tomohiro Masuda and Nobuhiko Isa handling the GBA re-release), and Masaya Tsunemoto and Kazuhiro Kotani for Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins. The score for the Gargoyle's Quest spin-off series was composed by Harumi Fujita (I) and Yuki Iwai (II) (with Norihiko Togashi handling the Game Boy re-release of Gargoyle's Quest II). To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, Capcom released the Makaimura Ongakutaizen in Japan on December 28, 2005. This 7 disc boxed set featured over 350 tracks and was a complete soundtrack for the series to date featuring the complete scores of not only every entry of the Ghosts 'n Goblins and Gargoyle's Quest series, but also of every PC and home console port of each game therein. This collection quickly sold out and was praised by various video game music review sites. In reference to the series' soundtrack as a whole, one reviewer noted: > With each of Makaimura's original scores, Capcom's composers and sound > programmers pushed various consoles to the limits to produce high quality > scores. With Makaimura, Daimakaimura, and Choumakaimura, the series evolved > admirably to refine a dark action-packed orchestral sound that fitted the > scenes of the games. The classic series is especially strong thematically, > remembered not just for the first stage theme but for other striking > compositions. The series has demonstrated plenty of diversity over the years > with the Baroque-influenced approaches to Makaimura for WonderSwan and the > Red Arremer titles, the exceptionally ambient score to Demon's Blazon > Makaimura Monshou Hen, and the dabs of avant-garde and rock influence in the > classic series. All these factors considered, the series has secured the > legacy of being one of the most musically and technologically influential > video game franchises. Though selling for around $100 upon its release, the collection was highly sought out by fans and continues to fetch a high price on Internet auction sites such as eBay. Capcom released a soundtrack for Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins on September 30, 2006. Reception The Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise stands as Capcom's 8th best selling game franchise, having sold over 4.4 million units. It is generally well regarded by critics and somewhat notorious for its traditional high level of difficulty. Additionally, the franchise frequently makes cameo appearances—the character of Arthur in particular—in other Capcom titles, the latest of which being Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The main series starring Sir Arthur and Princess Prin-Prin was initially released as an arcade title in 1985 and subsequently re-released and ported to a variety of home computer consoles. It continues as an active intellectual property for Capcom with its latest release in 2010 on Apple's iOS. The NES release of Ghosts 'n Goblins was rated as the 54th best NES game of all time by IGN and the 124th best game on a Nintendo console by Nintendo Power. The game is considered by GameTrailers to be the world's second most difficult game ever made. As of 2008, the original Ghosts 'n Goblins is Capcom's 18th best selling title, having sold over 1.6 million units. Similarly, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is Capcom's 42nd best selling title, having sold over 1 million units. The main series went on a minor hiatus after the release of Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts in 1991. Capcom general producer Noritaka Funamizu explained that the Ghosts 'n Goblins games take a long time to develop and were not popular in Japan; as a result, Capcom had taken a net loss on previous installments and were wary of producing a new entry. With the exception of the largely overlooked Makaimura for WonderSwan which was released only in Japan, and a re-release of Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts on the Game Boy Advance, the main Ghosts 'n Goblins series did not see a major release until Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins on the PlayStation Portable in 2006. The return of the series received mixed to positive reviews. GameSpot noted that the entry would appeal to fans of the original, but that many of the old- school game mechanics including level design and jump mechanics, along with the traditional level of difficulty, may not appeal to the current generation of gamers. These concerns were echoed by such sites as GameDaily and AtomicGamer. Other sites such as IGN and GameCritics praised this adherence to the series' old-school mechanics and traditional level of difficulty, while noting that the new health, armor, and waypoint systems as well as tiered difficulty options went a long way in adjusting the difficulty for new gamers. Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins was also the first entry in the series to employ 3D graphics, a fact praised by most reviewers: \\"The 3D graphics enhance the 2D gameplay by giving the world a sense of depth without interfering with the gameplay, and the whole package simply glows with vibrant color and lighting effects.\\" The Gargoyles Quest spin-off saw a series of releases between 1990 and 1994. The introduction of RPG elements in Gargoyles Quest was praised, however reviewers noted an uneven level of difficulty. Demon's Crest was highly regarded as \\"one of the finest action titles on SNES, and without a doubt the crowning achievement of the Ghosts 'n Goblins line\\" by critics however went largely unnoticed in terms of sales being labeled a \\"major flop.\\" Similarly, the Maximo spin-off sub-series was initially well-received, though criticized for being difficult and inaccessible. Ghosts to Glory (2001) achieved PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits status in the United States selling more than 400,000 units in North America. IGN ranked the game as the 6th most difficult game on the PlayStation 2. A sequel, Maximo vs. Army of Zin was released in 2003 with better critical reception but faltering sales, ultimately leading to the cancellation of Maximo 3. The future of both the Gargoyles Quest and Maximo spin-off series is unknown.

At the 2007 national conference, held in Dunedin, two co-leaders were elected, Billot and Kay Murray, with Paul Piesse returning to his former role as Party President. Billot was co-leader for one year. Billot persuaded his Wellington friend and businessman Jack Yan to stand for the Alliance in 2008; Yan was number 12 on the list, but did not contest an electorate. Clare Curran, the New Zealand Labour Party MP for since 2008, has repeatedly encouraged Billot to join her party.

The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The government generally respects religious freedom in practice; however, it occasionally fails to enforce religious freedom laws when abuses occurred. There were some reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice; however, prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom.\\"Paraguay\\". International Religious Freedom Report 2008. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (September 19, 2008). Religious demography The country has an area of 406,752 square kilometres and a population of 6.3 million. According to the 2002 national census, 89.6 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, and 6.2 percent is evangelical Protestant. Groups that constitute less than 5 percent of the population include Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews (Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Mennonites, Muslims, and Baháʼís. A 2006 survey indicates similar results; however, 84.7 percent of respondents consider themselves Catholic, a decrease from 2002. Native-born citizens tend to be Catholic, while immigrants generally belong to other religious groups. The eastern department of Alto Parana has a large Muslim community due to substantial immigration from the Middle East, particularly Lebanon. A large Mennonite community flourishes in the western department of Boquerón. Members of other religious groups are concentrated in the largest cities, including Asunción, Ciudad del Este, and Encarnación. Non-Catholic immigrant groups tend to have a higher per capita income than the primarily Catholic, native-born citizens. Membership in religious groups is high. Legal/policy framework The Constitution protects Paraguayans' right to freedom of religion. It and other laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and impose few legal restrictions on religious expression or speech. The Constitution and other laws also protect the right of individuals to choose, change, and freely practice their religion; provide legal protections covering discrimination and persecution; and offer remedies for the violation of religious freedom. The Constitution recognizes the historical role of the Catholic Church (the dominant religion). Although the government is secular in name and practice, most government officials are Catholic, and Catholic clergy occasionally speak during official government events. There have been several senior officials who were Mennonites. Former President Fernando Lugo was a retired Catholic bishop, and a member of the Christian Democratic Party, a Catholic party. The government observes Maundy (Holy) Thursday, Good Friday, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Virgin of Caacupé Day, and Christmas as national holidays. The Constitution provides for conscientious objection to military service. The armed forces have an extensive Catholic chaplain program supported by the government. The Catholic Church considers this chaplaincy to be a diocese and appoints a bishop to oversee the program on a full-time basis. Although the Government does not place restrictions on religious publishing or other religious media, such publications are subject to libel law. The law does not prohibit, restrict, or punish the importation, possession, or distribution of religious literature, clothing, or symbols. All churches and religious organizations are required to register with the Ministry of Education and Culture. Registration includes completing required paperwork, obtaining certification as a nonprofit organization, passing financial and criminal background checks, and paying a small fee. The government imposes few controls on religious groups, and many remain unregistered, typically evangelical churches with few members. The government does not place restrictions on foreign missionaries; however, the process to obtain temporary or permanent residency is opaque and requires applicants, including missionaries, to pay fees in excess of $100 (400,000 guaraníes) per transaction and spend months or even years to obtain residency. The government permits, but does not require religious instruction in public schools. Parents are permitted to homeschool or send their children to the school of their choice without sanction or restriction. Restrictions on and abuses of religious freedom President Duarte and some of his supporters promoted intolerance toward the Catholic Church during the 2007-2008 presidential election campaign. In 2007 then-President Duarte made several discriminatory remarks against the Catholic clergy in an attempt to discredit candidate Fernando Lugo, a resigned Catholic bishop, who won the election. Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to give permission for blood transfusions reported that authorities challenged their \\"right to bodily self-determination.\\" In January 2007 police in Horqueta, Concepción Department, arrested Jehovah's Witness Pastor Juan Gill and four members of his congregation for refusing to authorize a blood transfusion for Gill's son, Magno Gill Bazan. In June 2007 a court found them innocent. In September 2007 police arrested Jehovah's Witnesses José Ortega and Asunción Bernarda Ortega Gaona for refusing to allow doctors to give their daughter blood transfusions. Doctors at the hospital administered the blood transfusion after obtaining a court order. Ten days after their arrest, the Ortegas were released from prison on bail; their case remained under investigation at the end of the period covered by this report. In May 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that the government's expropriation in 2005 of approximately of land in Puerto Casado owned by Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church was unconstitutional. In August 2007 the government and the Unification Church agreed to a donation of for distribution to local farmers. Thereafter, the Government granted the Church access to its remaining land holdings, and the Church remains active in the country. There are no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the Paraguay. The government generally takes steps to promote tolerance for religions or religious beliefs. On April 23, 2008, the government opened an investigation against anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi activist Ramon Dardo Casteluccio for threatening violence against members of a local human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO). Societal abuses and discrimination There were some reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice; however, prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom. The government investigated these cases but lacked adequate resources to resolve them. Anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages and symbols, including graffiti, appear sporadically. The government investigated but did not identify suspects. In July 2007 the newspaper ABC Color published an anti- Semitic article. Representatives of B'nai B'rith met with the publisher to express their concern. On November 9, 2007, then-presidential candidates Fernando Lugo and Lino Oviedo attended a memorial event honoring Jews persecuted and killed in 1938 by the Nazis on the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht). The government permitted an interfaith NGO to host a memorial event on September 11, 2007, at the National Congress.

In July 1863, during the American Civil War, Atwater was captured by the Confederate Army and found himself among the first batch of prisoners at the notorious Andersonville prisoner-of-war camp. He is notable for having created the Andersonville Death Register while imprisoned there, which recorded the identities of his fellow prisoners.“NPS. GOV:” Dorence Atwater Biography” He made a secret copy of his list of the dead and missing which later allowed him, in cooperation with Clara Barton, to mark the graves of otherwise unknown soldiers. Atwater was released from prison by President Andrew Johnson and sent to the Seychelles as a 23-year-old United States Consul. He was a proficient businessman who worked with lepers and other charities and was beloved by the Tahitian people, who called him \\"Tupuuataroa\\" (Wise Man). Early life Dorence Atwater was born in Terryville, Connecticut, in 1845, the third child of Henry Atwater and Catherine Fenn Atwater. As a child, he worked as a store clerk due to his fine handwriting and aptitude for numbers. Civil War Atwater was only sixteen years old when the American Civil War broke out. After listening to a Union recruiter of German nationality, Atwater, too young to serve, lied about his age and joined anyway. Although Henry Atwater hauled his disobedient son to Hartford to confess his lie, Atwater badly wanted to go to war. For over two years, he served as a scout, delivered important messages, and was involved in many battles. He wrote to his father telling him how his outfit had destroyed a bridge: “Imagine,” he said, “hundreds of men, each with his canteen full of turpentine. He pours out the turpentine as he gallops across the bridge, and last man across throws the lit match.” =Prisoner-of-war= One morning in July 1863, Atwater was exercising his horse in the woods when he was captured by two Confederates disguised in Yankee uniforms. The Battle of Gettysburg had just occurred, and a new prison named Camp Sumter in southwest Georgia, known to the prisoners as Andersonville and to Atwater as \\"hell itself\\", had just opened. Andersonville had a quota of 400 prisoners a day. The Confederates picked up Atwater on their way through Richmond, Virginia, and he was among the first prisoners to be marched to Andersonville. Atwater was ill when he arrived and was put into the prison hospital. Upon his recovery, his handwriting was discovered again and he was given the task of keeping the \\"Death List\\", a register of those who had died at the camp. He was ordered to produce two copies, one for the Confederates and one which, he was told, would go to the United States federal government. He suspected the Union would never see this copy and decided to keep his own list, hidden among the papers of the ones belonging to the Confederates. All the while, Atwater knew that if the prison leader, Captain Henry Wirz, discovered what he was doing, he would be hanged.“New York Tribune published Atwater's Andersonville Death Register” Atwater, c. 1870 When Atwater was released from Andersonville, the death list was completed. He dropped the huge list into his cotton laundry bag and walked through the Confederate lines with it. =Returning home= Shortly after Atwater arrived home, he pulled the Andersonville death list out of his bag and showed it to his father and siblings. There had been rumors that he had folded it and slipped it in the inner pocket of his coat. But as his brother Richard wrote, “First, the Union coats had no inside pockets, second, Dorence had no coat, and third, the huge, thick list was not folded.” Two days later, Atwater came down with diphtheria, typhoid, and scurvy. People rarely survived even one of these diseases, but Atwater did. Three weeks later, he was thin and weak but on the mend. He had just received a telegram requesting him to come to Washington, D.C. and bring the list. On the train there, word reached him that President Abraham Lincoln had been shot and was dying. Washington, D.C. was in chaos, and Atwater was still quite weak. A telegram then came from home notifying him that his father, who had nursed him through his illnesses, had diphtheria and was also dying. Atwater returned home at the first opportunity. His father died that night. After handling the funeral, Atwater returned to Washington to begin work as an intern. He was barely 20 years old. There he met Clara Barton, who had the means to mark the Andersonville graves but no names with which to mark them; Atwater told her what she needed to know. This meeting began a lifelong friendship between Atwater and Barton. =General service and court-martial= Atwater took the death list and traveled with Barton, Dr. James Moore, and 42 headboard carvers to mark the graves of the soldiers who had died at Andersonville. Upon his return to Washington, D.C., he refused to reveal where his list was and was taken to be court-martialed. Barton consulted with President Andrew Johnson and Atwater received a general pardon. He later trained to be the U.S. Consul to the Seychelles Islands. The death list was eventually published by the federal government and reprinted by the New York Times. U.S. Consul to Tahiti Moetia Salmon Atwater (1848–1935) After three years, Atwater was sent to be Consul to Tahiti. There he fell in love with Princess Moetia Salmon, or \\"Moe\\", the sister of Queen Marau and the second consort of King Pōmare V of Tahiti. Moetia had been educated in France and England. They were married in 1875. The Atwaters had a home in San Francisco as well as in Tahiti. Their San Francisco house stood on Market Street, and while they were vacationing in Mexico, the great earthquake of 1906 occurred. In order to create a firebreak, Market Street had to be demolished by explosives and with it, the Atwater home. In their house was the original death list, the one Atwater had copied at the risk of his life. Death and legacy Atwater died on November 26, 1910, in San Francisco, at the age of 65. Funeral of Dorence Atwater in Tahiti He was interred in San Francisco while the royals of Tahiti planned to have his body returned. Atwater was the first non-royal to be given a royal funeral in Tahiti. He was buried beneath a 7000 lb stone. On one side is carved “Tupuuataroa” (Wise Man). On the other side, the inscription reads, “He builded better than he knew that one day he might awake in surprise to found he had wrought a monument more enduring than brass.” Princess Moe died in 1935, at the age of 87, and is buried next to Atwater.

It is also a dance accompanied by music from these drums. History Poster for interpretation of bamboula by the Franco- Louisianian Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Originating in Africa, the bamboula form appears in a Haitian song in 1757 and bamboula became a dance syncopation performed to the rhythm of the drum during festivals and ceremonies in Haiti (then Saint-Domingue). It was then exported to the United States (notably Mobile, Alabama, and the Virgin Islands) through Louisiana, by the Africans that were deported to New Orleans during the 18th century with the arrival of the displaced French settlers of the island of San Domingo especially after the Haitian Revolution. The slaves congregated on the Congo Square to the edge of the area of the French Quarter of New Orleans to dance the bamboula. In 1848, the American composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and whose maternal grandmother was a native of Saint-Domingue, composed a piece entitled Bamboula, the first of four Creole inspired piano works known as his Louisiana Quartet.  Use as an ethnic slur  In the present-day French language, the word bamboula has become an ethnic slur, directed at black people.

For two modules M and N, define \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N) to be the set of R-linear maps from M to N modulo the relation that f ~ g if f − g factors through a projective module. The stable module category is defined by setting the objects to be the R-modules, and the morphisms are the equivalence classes \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}(M,N). Given a module M, let P be a projective module with a surjection p \\\\colon P \\\\to M. Then set \\\\Omega(M) to be the kernel of p. Suppose we are given a morphism f \\\\colon M \\\\to N and a surjection q \\\\colon Q \\\\to N where Q is projective. Then one can lift f to a map P \\\\to Q which maps \\\\Omega(M) into \\\\Omega(N). This gives a well-defined functor \\\\Omega from the stable module category to itself. For certain rings, such as Frobenius algebras, \\\\Omega is an equivalence of categories. In this case, the inverse \\\\Omega^{-1} can be defined as follows. Given M, find an injective module I with an inclusion i \\\\colon M \\\\to I. Then \\\\Omega^{-1}(M) is defined to be the cokernel of i. A case of particular interest is when the ring R is a group algebra. The functor Ω−1 can even be defined on the module category of a general ring (without factoring out projectives), as the cokernel of the injective envelope. It need not be true in this case that the functor Ω−1 is actually an inverse to Ω. One important property of the stable module category is it allows defining the Ω functor for general rings. When R is perfect (or M is finitely generated and R is semiperfect), then Ω(M) can be defined as the kernel of the projective cover, giving a functor on the module category. However, in general projective covers need not exist, and so passing to the stable module category is necessary.  Connections with cohomology  Now we suppose that R = kG is a group algebra for some field k and some group G. One can show that there exist isomorphisms : \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}(\\\\Omega^n(M), N) \\\\cong \\\\mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(M,N) \\\\cong \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}(M, \\\\Omega^{-n}(N)) for every positive integer n. The group cohomology of a representation M is given by \\\\mathrm{H}^n(G; M) = \\\\mathrm{Ext}^n_{kG}(k, M) where k has a trivial G-action, so in this way the stable module category gives a natural setting in which group cohomology lives. Furthermore, the above isomorphism suggests defining cohomology groups for negative values of n, and in this way, one recovers Tate cohomology.  Triangulated structure  An exact sequence : 0 \\\\to X \\\\to E \\\\to Y \\\\to 0 in the usual module category defines an element of \\\\mathrm{Ext}^1_{kG}(Y,X), and hence an element of \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}(Y, \\\\Omega^{-1}(X)), so that we get a sequence : X \\\\to E \\\\to Y \\\\to \\\\Omega^{-1}(X). Taking \\\\Omega^{-1} to be the translation functor and such sequences as above to be exact triangles, the stable module category becomes a triangulated category.

The shelling resulted in the deaths of approximately 40 minority Sri Lankan Tamil civilians, including children, and more than 60 non- fatal injuries. The exact cause and nature of the event is disputed between the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan government. The church is a Roman Catholic Marian shrine in Mannar district of Sri Lanka. With a history of over 400 years, this shrine acts as a center for pilgrimage and worship for Sri Lankan Catholics and others. The site is considered as the holiest Catholic shrine in the island. Background information During the British colonial period, when Sri Lanka was known as Ceylon, most civil service jobs were (roughly 60%) held by minority Sri Lankan Tamils who were approximately 15% of the population. This was enabled due to the availability of western style education provided by American missionaries and others in the Tamil dominant Jaffna peninsula. The preponderance of Tamils over their natural share of the population was used by populist majority Sinhalese politicians to come to political power by promising to elevate the Sinhalese people. These measures as well as riots and pogroms that targeted the minority Sri Lankan Tamils led to the formation of a number of rebel groups advocating independence for Sri Lankan Tamils. Following the 1983 Black July pogrom full scale civil war began between the government and the rebel groups. During the 1990s the church was established as a safe and neutral zone by the UNHCR. It was free of rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam cadres and Sri Lankan Army soldiers. The church had housed thousands of civilians as a refuge. In May 1999, the Sri Lankan Army breached the longstanding agreement of “no guns, no uniform” and took control of a formerly neutral area. The army also cleared the shrine of all refugees. p.34 The event By early November 1999, the LTTE began a counterattack that saw it advance toward Madhu. Thousands of persons seeking to escape expected fighting sought refuge in Madhu. UNHCR was asked by the LTTE to transfer about 3,000 displaced residents of nearby Palampidy camp to Madhu church. But initially this was prevented by government troops based in Madhu. They later relented and allowed the displaced persons to reach the church. Following the reestablishment of refugee camp, the military withdrew from the church. On November 20, government troops began to reestablish their positions in Madhu. This led to an exchanged of fire with LTTE cadres stationed nearby. Number of shells landed in the church, killing approximately 40 displaced civilians, including 13 children, and injuring nearly 60 others. Reactions Responsibility for the attack could not be easily determined. The government and LTTE blamed the other for the deaths. The UK.-based Tamil Center for Human Rights said, \\"An armored column of Sri Lankan Army tanks opened fire on Madhu Church Shrine.\\" However, the then President Kumaratunga said, \\"The deaths of these refugees were caused by mortar attacks carried out by the LTTE directed at the Madhu Church”. The Catholic Church, local human rights groups, and international organizations blamed both sides for not respecting the long established neutral zone . Following the incident both the government troops and the LTTE withdrew from the immediate area. They continued to fight in nearby areas, causing approximately 14,000 people to seek refuge in the Madhu church again. By the end of the year approximately 17,000 displaced persons were housed at the church. UNHCR, which had shut down its camp at the church following the shelling, returned to assist the newly displaced refugees. With the escalation of violence in 2007-2008, the civilians sheltered in the premises had to flee further north and the holy statue of Virgin Mary itself had to be moved because of repeated shelling.

Riger made his first sports drawing in 1945: a scene from an Army-Notre Dame football game. From 1947 to 1949 Riger did magazine layout for Esquire and The Saturday Evening Post, then worked as an advertising art director until 1955, when he became a freelance illustrator. He was a regular contributor to Sports Illustrated since its first month of publication in 1954. During his career, the magazine published more than 1,200 of his editorial drawings and over 200 of his promotional and advertising drawings.see NYT obit  Photography  In 1950, he began taking photographs as a research tool for his drawings. What started as a secondary medium became what Riger was most known for. He described his approach to sports journalism: > You cannot possibly photograph sport unless you understand it completely, > and understand and know the men who play it. The same intensity they have to > play the game you must have to record it. Not stop it, but suspend it > forever in time. From 1950 to 1994, he copyrighted more than 90,000 master photographic negatives, more than 40,000 of them involving pro football.see NYT obit Many of these photographs appeared in Sports Illustrated, and Riger published two ground-breaking books of sports photo-journalism: The Pros: A Documentary of Professional Football in America, Simon & Schuster, 1960 and The American Diamond, Simon & Schuster, 1965. In addition to football and baseball, Riger's images cover boxing, horse racing, and all things Olympic. (see Getty Images ) His subjects were celebrated athletes of the day: Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Jack Nicklaus, Willie Mays, Johnny Unitas, Frank Gifford, Muhammad Ali, Jim Clark, Eddie Arcaro, Nadia Comăneci, Wilma Rudolph, Pelé and those who coached them Vince Lombardi, Willie Schaeffler among others.  Television & Film  Riger's television career began with Monday morning football analysis on Today (NBC Program) on NBC in 1961. In 1963, he began three years of world travel and weekly appearances on ABC's Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series),\\" doing the incisive on-camera picture reporting that preceded the days of color and gave ABC Sports an added dimension to their coverage. At ABC, where he worked from 1963 to 1970 and again from 1977 to 1980, he won nine Emmy awards. He developed his ground breaking slow-motion video work on the broadcasts of the 1968, 1976 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games and the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. As Second Unit Director, Riger was responsible for the acclaimed soccer sequences in the movie Escape to Victory (1981), directed by John Huston, which deals with Allied prisoners of war facing German soccer stars during World War II and starring Sylvester Stallone.  Books & Exhibitions  Riger was also the author and illustrator of over 13 books, many of the early ones for juvenile audiences. In 1963, author Ralph Moody wrote Come On Seabiscuit (), which was illustrated by Robert Riger and recently brought back into print by the University of Nebraska Press. It served as an inspiration for Laura Hillenbrand. On the radio show Fresh Air with Terry Gross on July 29, 2003, Hillenbrand said of Moody's book: > When I was about seven years old. . . . I found a children's book called > Come on Seabiscuit! which was just wonderful! I read it so many times I > broke the spine and all the pages fell out.

Accessed June 6, 2016. \\"According to the press release, the Metro USAR Strike Team is made up of nine fire departments from Bayonne, Elizabeth, Hackensack, Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, Paterson, Morristown as well as the five-municipality North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue Agency.\\" History North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue's Fire Headquarters, located in West New York Discussions to consolidate the North Hudson fire departments began in the early 1980s. The North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue (NHRFR) was established on January 11, 1999. The former fire departments of North Bergen, Union City, Weehawken, West New York, and Guttenberg were merged to provide a safer, more efficient fire department. A buyout was offered by the State giving any members with at least 20 years of service up to an additional five years towards their 25-year required time for retirement. Through this attrition the department was able to pare down the number of personnel in the newly formed department. Most firefighters who had the time took advantage of it, and retired under their own prior department's retirement contract and benefits. The last member to retire from the NHRFR under a former FD city contract was Battalion Chief James McMains on December 31, 1999, from the Township of North Bergen, under the NBFD Officers contract. From that point a new contract was negotiated for the NHRFR, and former city contracts no longer existed.North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue History page Accessed January 14, 2009 The department is divided into three battalions, which comprise a fire apparatus fleet of six engines, four squads(rescue-pumpers), four ladders, one rescue, a metro usar collapse rescue strike team unit (Rescue 2), a metro usar collapse rescue shoring unit, an air cascade unit, a mobile command unit, and two fire boats, that operate out of 13 fire stations located throughout the five communities. NHRFR Squad 2 operating at a fire in Union City The agency created a new headquarters on Port Imperial Boulevard in West New York in 2007 to serve the waterfront area.Tirella, Tricia (June 13, 2010). \\"New firehouse for regional squad\\" The Union City Reporter. pp. 3 and 7.North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue at Firefighting News; Accessed June 16, 2010 North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue was among the many Hudson County agencies that responded to the January 2009 crash of Flight 1549, for which they received accolades from the survivors.\\"Miracle on the Hudson' survivors to return to waterfront\\", The Union City Reporter, July 26, 2009, Page 4Tricia Tirella. \\"A pat on the back\\" The Union City Reporter; Pages 5 & 17 In July 2009, North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue began closing their Rescue Company and the rotational closings of three engine companies. The following January, two buildings adjacent to Engine Company 9 burned down while the company was closed.Hack, Charles. \\"North Bergen fire ruins two buildings two doors down from closed firehouse\\" Jersey Journal/NJ.com; January 18, 2010 The organization opened a two-story firehouse in June 2010 at 4300 Kennedy Boulevard, purchased for $1.2 million, and renovated for $1.5 million, in part with a $500,000 federal grant. The building houses Squad Company 1, Rescue Companies 1 & 2, and Battalion Chief 2. Mayor Brian Stack stated that the Kennedy Boulevard location, which is actually located off Kennedy Boulevard, would give the firefighters easier access to the area, as Kennedy Boulevard is a four-lane road that runs through the entire county, whereas the previous location was situated in the middle of a block. The agency's dispatch center, which was formed 30 years prior, also moved to a new state-of-the-art facility at the new location, as the equipment at its former, less spacious location at 50th Street and Broadway was deemed outdated. The agency rotated the closing of various firehouses for certain hours in order to save money until July 2010, when it closed two of its firehouses, according to NHRFR chairperson and Weehawken Mayor Richard F. Turner, in order to allow the remaining 13 to stay open 24 hours, and save $500,000 in overtime costs from July 1 until the end of 2010. Turner further disclosed that the newly implemented Strategic Reorganization Plan, which took two years to create, would also save additional funds. Though Turner insisted that this would not affect performance, Dominick Marino, the head of the North Hudson Firefighters Association, reacted to the closings by stating that this would sacrifice response time from certain locations, and that with the closing of Ladder 2, the agency would not have enough firefighters. According to Marino, \\"Evidence shows that [a ladder and engine] responding at the same time eliminates the circumstances a lot quicker than having to wait.\\" Marino further asserted that the closing of Engine 6 would mean that the entire west area of North Bergen would lose coverage, and that the promotion of 22 people to higher ranks in the last week of June, including 14 captains, five battalion chiefs and two deputies, meant that there was insufficient personnel to keep the houses open. Turner stated that hiring would be considered, based on upcoming retirements.Tirella, Tricia (July 4, 2010). \\"North Hudson FD closes two firehouses\\", The Union City Reporter. pp. 3 and 15 Turner later stated the intention to hire new members in early 2011.Tirella, Tricia (September 5, 2010). \\"Regional fire dept. budget up 3 percent\\". The Union City Reporter. pp. 5 and 7. Fox 5 News reporter Lisa Evers reporting on a January 2012 Union City fire to which the NHRFR responded The agency's 2010 budget, which was passed on August 17, 2010, is $55.9 million, a 3% increase from the previous year's budget of $54.2 million, with the largest increase in health benefits, which are covered by Horizon Blue Cross. (The NHRFR was previously covered by Cigna.) The August 17 meeting also saw the passing of a resolution allowing the agency to pay contractual terminal benefits, or retirement packages, to firefighters over the course of the five years following their retirement, instead of entirely within the year of their retirement. This resolution followed the passing a New Jersey state law () that NHRFR officials indicated supersedes contractual obligations with unions. On December 12, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the departments hiring policy discriminated against African-Americans, because it only accepted residents of local towns, who are predominantly Latino and Caucasian. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2007 by the Newark branch of the NAACP on behalf of three black firefighters, was the latest development in a longstanding controversy over whether the NHRFR should hire applicants from outside towns.\\"Briefs\\". The Union City Reporter. December 18, 2011. pp. 2 and 5. In July 2014, the NHRFR launched Marine 1, a new fireboat obtained through a 2010 $1.2 million FEMA port security grant. Marine 1 was specially designed for the areas served by the NHRFR, which include buildings and walkways situated very close to the edge of the Hudson River. Manufactured by Metal Craft Marine in Ontario, Canada, Marine 1 can operate in less than two feet of water, and carries four hose guns capable of supplying 4,250 gallons of water per minute and 100 gallons of firefighting foam for combustible liquid fire. It is also equipped with infrared cameras and night vision googles. It joins a smaller, 27-foot-long quick response boat that was also acquired through a grant two years earlier. Both boats are docked at Lincoln Harbor in Weehawken.Schwartz, Art (July 27, 2014). \\"River patrol\\". The Union City Reporter. pp. 1, 8 and 9.

Route description US 74/US 129 (Appalachian Highway), in Murphy US 19/US 19E switch at Cane River US 19 begins at the Georgia state line overlapped with US 129; into North Carolina, it joins with US 64/US 74 in Ranger. From Ranger to Andrews, the highway is a four-lane expressway that bypasses all the towns and communities along its route. After Andrews, US 19 reverts to two- lane through the Nantahala Gorge, which both scenic and somewhat curvy drive till Almond. At the start of the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, US 19 exits off towards the towns of Bryson City and Cherokee. At Cherokee, travelers may go north on US 441 to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park or to the Blue Ridge Parkway before traveling through the rest of the Qualla Boundary. The highway expands back into a four-lane expressway in Maggie Valley, where it then merges with the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway for before exiting back off towards Clyde. From here, US 19 parallels with I-40 to Asheville. US 19 joins other highways in Asheville crossing over the French Broad River, then follows I-26 to Mars Hill, North Carolina. At exit 9, US 19 splits from I-26/US 23; after , US 19 splits into US 19E and US 19W at Cane River. US 19 travels a total of from the Georgia state line to Cane River.

McGough Freeway – official name of I-26/US 19/US 23 from I-240 to the Buncombe/Madison county line (approved on April 4, 2002). =Scenic byways= US 19 is part of two scenic byways in the state (indicated by a Scenic Byways sign). Nantahala Byway is an byway from Marble to Whittier; it traverses along the Nantahala River and Tuckasegee River. US 19 overlaps almost the entire route, except south and east of Bryson City. This byway also connects to the Indian Lakes Scenic Byway (at Topton and Almond via US 129 and NC 28). Mount Mitchell Scenic Drive is an byway from Interstate 26, through Burnsville, to the summit of Mount Mitchell State Park. It is known for its vistas in and around the Black Mountains. US 19 overlaps from Interstate 26 to Micaville. History Established in 1927, US 19 traversed from the Georgia state line (at Bellview) to the Tennessee state line (at Elk Park), roughly similar to the route seen today. In 1930, US 19 was truncated at Cane River, where it was split into US 19E and US 19W; US 19E follows the original US 19 routing north. In 1932, it was rerouted in Asheville from Haywood Road to Clingman Avenue, to Hilliard Avenue to Biltmore AVenue towards Broadway Street. In 1937, US 19 was rerouted south of Almond to its current alignment today; while it was rerouted through downtown Asheville again: from Haywood Road to Clingman Avenue to Patton Avenue to College Avenue to Biltmore Avenue towards Broadway Street. In the 1940s, additional construction work on US 19 was assured by a compromise made with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in return for right-of-way through the Qualla Boundary for the Blue Ridge Parkway. In 1947, US 19 was rerouted from Ela, traversing through Dillsboro, Sylva, and Waynesville, to Lake Junaluska. The old route, through Cherokee and Maggie Valley became US 19A. In 1948, it was switched, having US 19 back along the original route and US 19A going south to Lake Junaluska. In 1949, US 19 was moved onto the Smokey Park Highway/Patton Avenue as a bypass in West Asheville. The old alignment became US 19A (today's US 19 Business). In 1952, US 19 was rerouted off Martins Creek Road and onto Blairsville Highway, near Ranger. In 1954, US 19 was realigned to its current route from Lake Junaluska to Clyde and Canton; of the old route was replaced by NC 209\\\\. Between 1955-57, US 19 was split onto one-way streets in downtown Asheville: Northbound used Patton, to Market, to Woodfin, to Broadway; southbound used Broadway to College, to Patton. In 1961, US 19 removed from downtown Asheville and put on the East-West Expressway, north at Marrimon Avenue. Between 1963-68, US 19 was split onto one-way streets in downtown Canton (Park Street and Main Street). In 1961, US 19 was moved onto new freeway west of Weaverville; the old route became US 19 Business. In 1973, US 19 was removed from Marrimon Avenue to its current alignment north of Asheville. In 1975, the freeway, US 19 traversed, was extended from Weaverville to Mars Hill. In 1979, US 19 bypassed Andrews, US 19 Business replaced old route. In 1980, US 19 bypassed Murphy, US 19 Business replaced old route. In 1984, US 19 was realigned in Yancey County to its current routing, US 19W was extended south. On November 2, 2012, US 19/US 19E was widened from I-26 to Jacks Creek Road, just west of Burnsville. At $107.9 million, the two-lane mountain road was upgraded to a four-lane highway, and the first for Yancey County. Governor Bev Perdue was on hand at the ribbon cutting ceremony opening the highway. Future US 19/74, from Andrews to Almond, is to be realigned onto a new multi-lane highway west of the Nantahala Gorge. The project is broken into several sections, all subject to reprioritization. US 19/23, from Canton to Candler, is to be widened to a multi-lane highway and its bridge replaced over the Pigeon River. This project is currently funded. US 19, in concurrency with Interstate 26 and US 23, is planned to be realigned onto a new interchange at Interstate 240 and freeway improvements north from it. Right-of-way purchases are to begin in 2023, however the project is unfunded.

Going through Weaverville, it continued its concurrency with US 19 till Bald Creek, where it went north with US 19W into Tennessee. By 1932, US 23 was rerouted in Asheville to use Haywood to Clingman to Hilliard to Biltmore which turns into Broadway. By 1937, US 23 was rerouted again, using Clingman to Patton to College to Biltmore. Between 1939-44, US 23 was rerouted in Waynesville to use US 276 Russ St to Walnut St back to US 23 Bus. The old Main St routing became US 19A-23A. In 1949, US 23 was moved west onto new bypass (Patton Avenue) around western Asheville, leaving US 23 Alternate (later US 23 Business).

In Hendersonville, it connects with US 64, which connect travelers to nearby Chimney Rock, Lake Lure and Brevard. At I-26's exit 44, US 25 splits from I-26/US 74 and onto a four-lane road through Fletcher. In Arden, US 25A begins, providing a alternate route that avoids Skyland and Biltmore Forest; the intersection also begins the Asheville city limit, which encompasses everything between US 25 and US 25A. Between Skyland and Biltmore Forest, the Blue Ridge Parkway crosses over US 25 with access roads along both north and southbound lanes. US 25 enters Asheville proper near I-40; passing underneath, it enters the Biltmore Village, where US 25A merges back and the Biltmore Estate is located. Passing over the Swannanoa River, US 25 enters the downtown area along McDowell Street then onto Southside Avenue and Biltmore Avenue.

Entering the Pisgah National Forest near Walnut, US 25/US 70 go westerly, crossing the French Broad River in Hot Springs, then crossing through the Bald Mountains into Tennessee. =Scenic byways= US 25 is part of two scenic byways in the state (indicated by a Scenic Byways sign). French Broad Overview is an byway from Weaverville to Marshall; it is known for its scenic views along the French Broad River. The byway begins at the Monticello Road intersection in Weaverville, where it connects with NC 251 along the banks of the French Broad River; it continues north, switching to US 25/70 Business into Marshall and it back along US 25/70. Appalachian Medley is an byway from near Lake Junaluska to Walnut; it is known for several recreational areas, the Appalachian Trail, and its scenic mountain drive. US 25/70 is on of the byway from Walnut to Hot Springs, where it continues via NC 209. History 130px Established as an original U.S. Route (1926), US 25 was assigned along the Dixie Highway, which followed NC 29 from South Carolina, through Tuxedo, Flat Rock, Hendersonville, and Biltmore Forest, to Asheville. In the downtown area, US 25 links-up with US 70/NC 20 on College Street; it then proceeds north along Merrimon Avenue out of the city. Following Old Marshall Highway to Marshall, it continues along the same route as today into Tennessee. In 1929, NC 29 was replaced by an extension of NC 69; in 1934, both NC 20 and NC 69 were dropped from the route. Around 1933, US 25 was rerouted along McDowell Street from Biltmore Avenue. During the mid-1950s, US 25 was split onto one-way streets in Hendersonville (northbound King Street/southbound Main Street); by the early 1960s, southbound traffic moved onto College Street, replacing US 25 Alternate (originally established sometime in 1939-1944 as a bypass through the main roads of town). In 1960, a bypass north around Marshall was completed, old route through town became US 25 Business (along with US 70). Around 1969, the community of Walnut was bypassed. In 1981, US 25 was moved onto the existing US 19/US 23 freeway north of Asheville, it then went on to new four-lane road west of Weaverville; the most of the old route was replaced by NC 251. In 1974, US 25 was placed onto new expressway between Zirconia to the South Carolina state line, the old route would later become part of NC 225 in 1997.

History  FuelWatch was created by the Western Australian Government in January 2001 in response to a Parliamentary Select Committee which investigated the then intra-daily price changes and the city-country price differential in 2000. On 2, January 2001 FuelWatch commenced daily monitoring of prices for petrol, diesel and LPG within metropolitan Perth and many regional areas in the South West of the state. In May 2003, following consultation with the community, local governments and industry the Government extended the FuelWatch boundaries to include an additional 24 towns and five local government districts. Today, FuelWatch extends over the metropolitan area and 52 regional locations, equating to approximately 80% of regional and 100% metropolitan retail outlets in Western Australia. The information provided by FuelWatch is provided via a website, phone service and media sources, enabling WA motorists to access the best fuel prices in their area. FuelWatch gives consumers better access to information and allows them to make an informed decision when it comes to their fuel purchases. By removing the ability for retailers to alter their prices for a 24-hour period, the consumer has a certainty as price to expect to pay and has the ability to shop around. A study undertaken in 2007 by the ACCC found that on average FuelWatch led a to a decrease in pricing. It is currently part of Australia's Department of Commerce. In 2008 there were plans to implement a nationwide FuelWatch system, to be run by the Commonwealth. This was defeated by a tied vote in the Senate.

Early life and education Maginn was born in Mallow, County Cork, Ireland in 1861. His father was a Church of Ireland vicar, and his mother was well-connected to wealthy families in Ireland. His uncle William Maginn was a journalist who amongst other achievements co-founded and was a notable supporter of Fraser's Magazine. At the age of 5, he was about to be sent to Christ's Hospital (a famous boarding school in England), however he became deaf that year due to scarlet fever and his parents sent him to the Royal London Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, which was on Old Kent Road at that time. Maginn excelled at school and was offered a junior teachership at 17 in the Royal London Asylum's Margate Branch. He kept this position for five years, returned to Ireland for a year, and then went to the National Deaf-Mute College (later known as Gallaudet University) in Washington, DC. The move from Ireland to America had a profound effect on Maginn, who felt he now had the ability to achieve a higher level of attainment. He spent three years at Gallaudet and did not graduate because he had to leave to be at his father's bedside, but he left highly regarded and with letters of support (he received an honorary degree from Gallaudet in later life). Leaving Gallaudet, Maginn felt that the British approach to deafness was one of injustice, and that his life's work would be to enhance the quality of life for deaf in the United Kingdom. Return to Ireland and first steps towards a British Deaf Association  Maginn returned to Ireland in 1882, he wanted to identify a potential springboard to establish a national association and he joined the Deaf and Dumb Correspondence Association, which was led by some influential deaf people of that time. The first attempt to establish an association, the Deaf-Mute Association was formed on 1 February 1888 to 'further the cause of the deaf and dumb' but it was short-lived. There were 239 members were recruited into its membership but, due to insufficient numbers, the association closed in 1889. Despite the closure of the association, Francis Maginn and James Paul, a missioner and founder of the National Deaf and Dumb Society, were funded to attend the event marking 100 years anniversary of the death of a French educator and \\"Father of the Deaf\\" Charles-Michel de l'Épée. They made a pact on the train journey to Paris, France, to re-establish a national association and, by the time they arrived in Calais on the way home, the British delegates lent their support. Royal Commission on the Blind, the Deaf and the Dumb The UK Royal Commission for the Blind, the Deaf and the Dumb's report was published by Lord Egerton in 1889, recommending mandatory education for the deaf. Before publication, witnesses gave evidence to the commission, including Alexander Graham Bell who promoted the use of the pure oral method of education and proposed to prevent marriage between deaf people, the latter was rejected by the commission. Also, Edward Gallaudet gave evidence and promoted the developments in Washington, US. Maginn had previously met Bell while studying in America, and wrote that \\"The deaf mutes of the US recognise the fact that he is acting in all sincerity and with the best of intentions and that their esteem for him is not lessened by the contempt in which they hold his theories.\\" The Egerton Report was in response to the (now infamous) 1880 Milan Congress declaring that sign language was to be banned from schools teaching deaf children, which had the side-effect of excluding hundreds of deaf teachers, teaching assistants and care staff from deaf schools in Europe and North America. The Egerton Report supported the oral system. Rev. William Blomefield Sleight, the son of William Sleight, head master of the Brighton Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, sat on the commission and signed it in 1889 with reservations, which were printed in The Times: :\\"The contention of Messrs. Owen and Sleight is that the Oral System breaks down in after life, and that its pupils not infrequently resort to writing and the manual alphabet. They, therefore, advocate the \\"Combined Method\\" -i.e., the main instruction being carried on by means of the finger alphabet and signs, articulation and lip-reading being taught as accomplishments to those who show aptitude for receiving such instruction.\\" (24 October 1889) Founding of the British Deaf Association In January 1890, a national conference for the deaf was held in St Saviour's Church for the deaf in London. Here, Maginn presented his views for improving the deaf education system in Britain. He proposed forming a national association for the deaf, and said that the American Combined Method education system, which incorporated fingerspelling, Signed English and lip-reading (the manualism approach), which gave access to English as a written language and spoken language, where possible. At the conference, it was agreed that there should be a national association representing the deaf community in the British Empire. The conference was presided by Rev. William B. Sleight, he permitted the conference to start earlier on morning of 18 January 1890, to hear the proposal for the establishment of a new national association. :By consent, Francis Maginn was given the floor, and he spoke eloquently for the next half an hour or so about the need of an organised association that would command respect and watch other the interests of the deaf people in Britain, whether these interests be educational, moral or social. As a consequence of this ruling, a special committee was set up to establish a constitution made up of six deaf and six hearing men, under the chairmanship of Rev. William B. Sleight. Francis would have preferred if no hearing people were involved in this committee but he was over-ruled and acceded to the majority of the conference. Maginn was one of the 6 Deaf men, who sat on this committee. A new constitution was adopted by the committee, but there were concerns over two elements: the name of the new association; and the criteria for membership. First, instead of the \\"National Association for the Deaf,\\" they decided on the name of \\"British Deaf And Dumb Association.\\" Though it was pointed out that the word \\"dumb\\" was no longer in use in America, the term was not removed from their title, BDDA, until 1970. Secondly, though Maginn wanted only deaf people to become members, the steering group said they would allow hearing members who took an active interest in the welfare of the deaf, provided they were proposed by five deaf people. Maginn hotly disagreed with this decision, objecting to the idea of the \\"benevolent paternalism\\" of the hearing friends of the deaf. The Association championed the use of sign language in deaf schools rather than pure oral systems. The Association was formed in the Lecture Hall of the Leeds Church Institute, in Albion Place, Leeds, on 24 July 1890. The membership admission criteria were heavily discussed and it was agreed that: :Persons who can hear taking an active interest in the welfare and education of the deaf and dumb, shall be eligible for admission to ordinary membership on the recommendation of five ordinary members of the association. Sleight, a hearing man, was elected as the chairman of the association, and Maginn was given the role of regional vice-president; an honorary position with no real power, which was a blow to Maginn's confidence. Maginn himself gradually withdrew from the Association and concentrated his energy on Ulster Institute for the Deaf. Maginn confined his later years to work in Belfast until his death in 1918. The British Deaf Association didn't have a deaf chair until the appointment of Jock Young as their first Deaf chair in the 1980s and their first deaf chief executive Jeff McWhinney was appointed in the 1990s. Ulster Institute for the Deaf Despite his failure to create the first fully representative association of deaf people in the UK, he rescinded his role in the BDDA and went back to Belfast to focus on his work as the superintendent at the Ulster Institute for the Deaf, where he was much appreciated by Ulster's deaf community. Legacy He is the only deaf historical figure native to the UK and Ireland that is still talked about and respected by the deaf community a century later.

The experimental system is based on genetic crosses of different mutant strains of bacteriophage T4, a virus that infects the bacteria E. coli. Origin One type of mutation in the T4 bacteriophage identified by researchers in phage genetics by the 1950s was known as r (for rapid), which caused the phage to destroy bacteria more quickly than normal. These could be spotted easily because they would produce larger plaques rather than the smaller plaques characteristic of the wild type virus. Through genetic mapping, the researchers had identified specific regions in the T4 chromosome, called the rI, rII, and rIII loci, associated with the r mutants. In 1952, while performing experiments with rII mutants, Seymour Benzer found a strain that did not behave normally. By 1953, after the publication of Watson and Crick's proposed structure of DNA, Benzer hit on the idea that the apparently defective r mutants might have been the result of crossing two different rII mutants, each of which had part of the rII gene intact, so that the hybrid strain did not exhibit the r phenotype at all because it combined the intact parts of the rII gene.Weiner, p. 52. From there, Benzer saw that it would be possible to generate many independent r mutants, and by measuring the recombination frequency between different r strains, he could map the substructure of a single gene. Although the chance of successful recombination between any mating pair of rII mutants is small, a single petri dish could be the basis for millions of trials at once. They could be screened easily by using a specific strain of E. coli, known as K12 (λ), that was susceptible to wild type T4 but not to r mutants.Jayaraman, p. 903 Benzer's concept was quite controversial within classical genetic thought, in which each gene is treated as a singular point along a chromosome, not a divisible stretch of nucleic acids (as implied by the work of Watson and Crick). Initially, Max Delbrücka respected phage geneticist and leader of the so-called phage group of which Benzer was a partfound Benzer's idea outrageous.Weiner, p. 53 Benzer's work Beginning in 1954, Benzer put the T4 rII system to use, creating and crossing hundreds of r mutants and developing an increasingly detailed map of the structure of the rII gene. In his early work, he identified two separate but very close loci within the rII region, which he suggested were nucleotide sequences that encoded different polypeptides; he called these \\"cistrons\\".Jayaraman, pp. 904-905 Benzer identified a number of different types of r mutants. Some he classified as deletions, others as point mutations. By various crosses of the many different strains exhibited deletions and point mutations, Benzer located each point mutation into a sub-region of one of the cistrons, and ordered the point mutations within that sub-region. Benzer also proposed missense and nonsense mutations from his rII studies. The T4 rII system enabled Benzer to identify recombination frequencies as low as .02%, much lower than in typical genetics experiments. This was equivalent to detecting recombination between only one or two base pairs.Jayaraman, pp. 905-908 In the early 1950s the prevailing view was that the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the T4 rII system, during 1955-1959, showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure and are likely to be equivalent to a linear section of DNA (see also Phage group). Work by others After Benzer demonstrated the power of the T4 rII system for exploring the fine structure of the gene, others adapted the system to explore related problems. For example, Francis Crick and others used one of the peculiar r mutants Benzer had found (a deletion that fused the A and B cistrons of rII) to demonstrate the triplet nature of the genetic code.Jayaraman, pp. 907-908 The principal that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4Sydney Brenner (Author), Lewis Wolpert (Contributor), Errorl C. Friedberg (Contributor), Eleanor Lawrence (Contributor) 2001 My Life in Science: Sydney Brenner, A Life in Science (see pages 93-96) 2001 Biomed Central Ltd (publisher) (also see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment). Richard Feynman, the renowned Caltech theoretical physicist, worked on the T4 rII system during the summer of 1961, and his experimental results were included in a publication by Edgar et al. These authors showed that recombination frequencies between rII mutants are not strictly additive. The recombination frequency from a cross of two rII mutants (a x d) is usually less than the sum of recombination frequencies for adjacent internal sub- intervals (a x b) + (b x c) + (c x d). Although not strictly additive, a systematic relationship was observed that likely reflects the underlying molecular mechanism of recombination (see genetic recombination and synthesis dependent strand annealing).

The film, based on an acclaimed short story by Akhil Sharma and written by screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan (Monsoon Wedding), is a cross-cultural romance between a confused and lonely middle-aged Indian, who has lived in America for 20 years, and his exasperating, free-spirited blonde neighbour. The film was released theatrically in 2003. It was televised nationally in 2004 on the PBS series Independent Lens. Plot In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\". With the help of the advice gleaned from the pages of Cosmopolitan, and to some extent in spite of it, Gopal and Mrs. Shaw (Helen) hit it off, and develop a warm, tender, intimate relationship. Mrs. Shaw is a high school counselor, and therefore a good and empathetic listener herself, and Gopal confides in her about his childhood dreams and sorrows. But the relationship does not go exactly as Gopal had planned. On Christmas Day, when Helen gently rebuffs his insistence on his long-term vision for the relationship, Gopal is very upset and shouts at her to leave. He then holes up sullen and frustrated in his house, refusing all attempts at communication from her, and is visibly angry when he sees she has a male visitor nearly a week later. On New Year's Eve, Gopal discovers Helen has left a Christmas gift for him, and it is something very meaningful to him. He breaks down, and something in him shifts – regarding the relationship, his family, and himself. Cast and characters *Roshan Seth – Gopal, a retired middle-aged Indian immigrant, who has been in America 20 years, and who has been complacently wed since childhood in an arranged marriage to Madhu *Carol Kane – Mrs. Shaw (Helen), Gopal's exasperating divorcée neighbour, who has conspicuous one-night stands and whose house and car are conspicuously unkempt in Gopal's eyes *Madhur Jaffrey – Madhu, Gopal's wife *Purva Bedi – Geetu, Gopal and Madhu's daughter, who has grown up in America and who is newly unemployed *Yolande Bavan – Preema, Madhu's Indian- American friend, who is enthused about an MLM (multi-level marketing scheme) *Taj Crown – Harish, Preema's husband, who is also an MLM convert *Neerja Sharma – Vandana, Preema and Harish's daughter *Kal Penn – Vandana's fiancé, a pre-med student *Niket Subhedar – Young Gopal, whose life in India revolves around cricket *Stephen Barker Turner – Hans, Geetu's German boyfriend, who takes her off to Mongolia to teach English and live in a yurt Cast information Distinguished Indian actor Roshan Seth, a 20-year veteran of major American and British films, including lead roles in Gandhi, Mississippi Masala, Not Without My Daughter, My Beautiful Laundrette, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, was chosen for the starring role of Gopal, the suddenly single Indian patriarch. Seth had also played the groom's father in screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan's 2001 film, Monsoon Wedding. Oscar-nominee Carol Kane, familiar to many as Latka's wife Simka on the sitcom Taxi, and noted also for her roles in Hester Street, Annie Hall, The Princess Bride, and Scrooged, was chosen to play Gopal's unconventional American neighbour, divorcée Mrs. Shaw. \\"There was no other (casting) choice\\" for Mrs. Shaw, said co-producer Jen Small, who had previously worked with Kane on the 1998 PBS film The First Seven Years. Director Nisha Ganatra agreed: \\"We wanted to take advantage of Carol's incredible comic timing, and that way she has of making you laugh and breaking your heart at the same time.\\"Byrne, Bridget. \\"Carol Kane Dances into PBS' Cosmopolitan Romance.\\" Associated Press. May 30, 2004. To round out the major cast, Ganatra chose Merchant-Ivory actress Madhur Jaffrey, who had been in her 1999 film Chutney Popcorn, to play Gopal's disgruntled wife. Up-and-comer 18-year-old Indian-American actress Purva Bedi (American Desi) was cast as Gopal's daughter Geetu. According to Ganatra, it was interesting watching Roshan Seth's and Carol Kane's conflicting acting styles. \\"Seth comes from the British school of theater acting and believes that his job is to deliver a consistent performance. Kane comes from the American school, where improvisation rules and a certain performance may not be duplicated. Seth wanted lots of rehearsals; Kane thought too much practice would make her performance stale.\\"Walsh, Christine. \\"Cosmopolitan Sheds Light on First-Generation Confusion.\\" India New England.

Producers Jen Small, Jason Orans, and Brian Devine found \\"Cosmopolitan\\", which they considered \\"a little gem\\", in the 1998 anthology. They signed award- winning screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan (Monsoon Wedding) to adapt it for their newly formed New York-based independent production company, Gigantic Pictures. \\"The rights to short stories are more accessible financially for small companies; and you can add, where a novel demands cutting\\", says Small.Glucksman, Mary. In Focus: Mary Glucksman Profiles Six New Feature Films in Production: Cosmopolitan. Filmmaker Magazine. Spring 2003. Of the differences between adapting short stories versus novels, co-producer Jason Orans said, \\"Short stories are usually structured differently than movies. While a movie should have a three-act structure, a short story is often an exploration of character via a single defining event. The challenge is to create new material which both serves the story and supports a three-act structure. With Cosmopolitan, this meant [Sabrina Dhawan] adding a completely new first act to the story.\\"Cosmopolitan: Filmmaker Q & A. Independent Lens. Retrieved June 29, 2009. Director Nisha Ganatra, whose previous credits included the multiple-award-winning Chutney Popcorn, was also intrigued by Akhil Sharma's short story. In her words, \\"I thought, this is a story we haven't seen. Indian American filmmakers are making these stories that are very 'me, me, me' and the thing that I loved about Cosmopolitan is that it's about our parents and loneliness, and that I found was very universal and exciting.\\"Cosmopolitan: The Film. Independent Lens. Retrieved June 29, 2009. Screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan adapted, expanded, and fleshed out Sharma's short story. The original short story was very focused on Gopal's loneliness, and his initial inability to make physical or emotional contact with anyone. Dhawan kept and expanded the story's poignancy, while changing the focus to Gopal's relationship with Mrs. Shaw, giving the story specificity and universal relevance, and infusing it with wit. Score and soundtrack The score for the film was composed by Canadian-born composer Andrew Lockington, with whom director Nisha Ganatra, a fellow Canadian, had worked once before, on the 2003 film Fast Food High. The instrumental score includes string quartet, piano (performed by Lockington), clarinet, bansuri flute, and tabla drums.Official site – Credits. Retrieved June 29, 2009. The three Bollywood- parody songs, \\"Meri Desi Rani\\", \\"Come to Me\\", and \\"Destiny\\", were written, composed, and produced by eclectic New York Indo-pop pioneer Chris Rael. The songs were performed by Rael along with eight members of his Indo-pop band Church of Betty, and Rael also sang the male leads of the songs. Two of Rael's three Bollywood-parody songs in the film have dance numbers. One Bollywood- parody dance number features Kane, and the main dance number features Kane and Seth. Of his dancing in the main Bollywood number, Roshan Seth confessed, \\"I'm really quite spastic when it comes to all that, and uncoordinated, but Carol was very funny and we somehow got through it.\\"\\"Indian-American Stories on Film: Cosmopolitan\\" (audio interview of Roshan Seth by Robert Siegel).

The film's Bollywood street dance number was shot in New York City's Jackson Heights, where colourful Indian-American signage helped make a ready- made outdoor set. Ganatra observes humorously that the outdoor dance number \\"kept getting pushed on the schedule because of weather, and we finally did it on the coldest day of the year with the poor actors in saris\\". A few shooting locations had to be changed, and often the replacement locations turned out to be more interesting than those originally planned. A scene meant to take place in a large major bookstore could not be achieved, so it was shot in a little sweets shop attached to a restaurant the filmmakers were already shooting in.

CTM should not be confused with the work of a traditional travel agency. While agencies provide the day-to-day travel services to corporate clients, they are the implementing arm of what the corporation has negotiated and put forth in policy. In other words, CTM decides on the class of service which employees are allowed to fly, negotiates corporate fares/rates with airlines and hotels and determines how corporate credit cards are to be used. The agency on the other hand makes the actual reservation within the parameters given by the corporation. For many companies T&E; costs represent the second highest controllable annual expense, exceeded only by salary and benefits, and is commonly higher than IT or real estate costs. T&E; costs are not only limited to travel (airline, rail, hotel, car rental, ferry/boat, etc.) but include all costs incurred during travel such as staff and client meals, taxi fares, gratuities, client gifts, supplies (office supplies and services), etc. Furthermore, this area often includes meeting management, traveler safety and security as well as credit card and overall travel data management. The management of these costs are usually handled by the Corporate Travel Manager, a function which may be part of the Finance, HR, Procurement or Administrative Services Department. Global Consolidations Many companies, especially large multinationals (MNC), opt for global consolidation of their travel procurement. In other words, they may choose to put their entire purchasing of travel arrangements in the hands of one Travel Management Company (TMC). This is almost always done with a global Request for Proposal (RFP), through which the company will invite major TMCs to participate in the RFP. The process and the selection of the TMC could take several months. Once the company has chosen its TMC, the handling of their travel arrangements will be handled by the selected TMC throughout the world. There could, of course, be exceptions in certain countries. The advantages of a global consolidation lie in the game of numbers: the company will be able to bring to the table the advantage of global numbers when negotiating with suppliers. These negotiations could include airlines, hotel chains, individual hotels (for specific reasons), car-rental companies etc. The main goal of going the route of global consolidation is to create savings in the company's T&E; budget. Travel Management Companies The implementation of corporate travel management is often delegated to Travel Management Companies (TMC). A TMC will manage an organization's corporate or business travel program. They will often provide an online booking tool, mobile application, program management and consulting teams, executive travel services, meetings and events support, reporting functionality, and potentially others. These companies use Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to book flights for their clients. This allows the travel consultant to compare different itineraries and costs by displaying availability in real-time, allowing users to access fares for air tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars simultaneously.What is a TMC?. Youtube.com. Retrieved on 2017-11-23. Travel Management Lite Travel Management Lite, is a lightweight version of a Corporate Travel Management solution, generally used by SMEs and growth companies who don't require extensive or bespoke solutions offered by TMCs. The main advantage to a Lite solution is to enhance real-time transparency in travel spending across the company, and provides access to mobile and web apps needed to book and manage a company's travel. This allows business travellers, assistants, and travel managers to book more efficiently, and have faster access to support, than were they to use different leisure booking sites or offline travel agents.

The revolt was led by the Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos, and is named after his mother's native village, Theriso, the focal point of the revolt. The revolt stemmed from the dispute between Venizelos and the island's ruler, Prince George of Greece, over the island's future, particularly over the question of Cretan union with Greece. The conflict's origin can be traced to 1901, when Prince George dismissed Venizelos from the government. The hostility between Venizelos and the prince was precipitated by the latter's attitude toward foreign relations and by his refusal to engage in dialogue with his advisers over the island's internal affairs. After a prolonged political struggle, Venizelos and his followers decided upon an armed uprising, with the goals of uniting Crete with Greece and ushering in a more democratic government for the island. The Theriso revolt not only established Venizelos as the leading politician in Crete, but also brought him to the attention of the wider Greek world. His reputation would lead in 1909 to his call to Greece, where he became Prime Minister. Context =Autonomous Crete= George of Greece. In 1897, a renewed revolt broke out in Crete, which had been under Ottoman domination since the mid-17th century. The island's Christian majority wished to join Greece, but the Great Powers (France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary) were opposed to it. A compromise led to the creation of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty, guaranteed by the presence of military contingents of the Powers. Prince George of Greece, the second son of King George I, was named High Commissioner. In turn, Prince George named Eleftherios Venizelos prime minister. Disagreements soon emerged between the two men. Their first argument concerned the construction of a palace for Prince George. Shortly after his arrival on the island, the latter indicated his wish for a palace. Venizelos protested that a palace would be a symbol of permanence for a regime he intended to be temporary, while union with Greece was awaited. The offended prince eventually dropped his demand for a palace.C. Kerofilas, p.32 The principal source of contention between the Prince and Venizelos concerned their vision for the island's government. Although the chief author of the island's constitution (notably of articles guaranteeing individual liberties and equality between Christians and Muslims), Venizelos believed it was far too conservative and granted the Prince too much power. The Cretan assembly had few powers and only met once every two years. Moreover, ministers were in fact counselors to the prince, who alone could approve laws. Eleftherios Venizelos In foreign relations, Prince George alone was authorised to deal with the Great Powers, as illustrated by the absence of a foreign affairs minister. The Prince took responsibility for the matter of Greek annexation of the island and discussing the subject with the foreign ministers of Russia, France, Italy and Britain, without taking care to speak to his counselors. In the summer of 1900, when he was preparing to tour the European courts, the prince declared: \\"When I am travelling in Europe, I shall ask the Powers for annexation, and I hope to succeed on account of my family connections\\".Kerofilas, p.30 Venizelos thought union would be premature, especially as Cretan institutions were still unstable. He recommended instead the creation of a Cretan army, followed by the withdrawal of European troops. Once foreign control had diminished, then union with Greece could take place. However, this approach was dimly viewed by public opinion and the Athenian newspapers impatient for union to succeed.P. Kitromilides, p.72 =Dismissal of Venizelos= In February 1901, the Powers refused to make any change to the island's status. Although this demonstrated the correctness of Venizelos' approach, something Prince George publicly admitted,\\"You were quite right. The Powers refuse annexation point-blank\\", in Kerofilas, p.31 it was the minister who endured attacks from the press.P. Kitromilides, p.73 Venizelos handed in his resignation on two occasions: first on 5 March 1901, citing health reasons, and then on 18 March, explaining that he could not work while in permanent disagreement with his colleagues and the High Commissioner. George refused to accept his resignation, instead preferring to dismiss him for insubordination. On 20 March, posters on the walls of Chania announced the Prince's dismissal of Venizelos. After his departure, the newspapers launched an anti-Venizelos campaign. A series of articles possibly written by the Prince's secretary referred to him as the \\"insolent counselor\\", criticising his policies as anti-union, anti-dynastic and pro-Powers. After his dismissal, Venizelos withdrew from politics. However, in December 1901, he responded to the accusations by means of five articles in the newspaper Kyrix, prompting the Prince to throw his former minister in prison.P. Kitromilides, p.74 Revolt Venizelos next appeared on the public stage in the spring of 1905, when an insurrection against the Cretan government broke out. He was its leader, denouncing the corruption of Prince George's entourageJ. Tulard, p.117 and the ruler's inability to persuade the Great Powers to accept the idea of Crete's union with Greece.The Cretan Question, 1897–1908 The Powers, especially Russia and Austria-Hungary, adamantly opposed union for fear it would disrupt the fragile political equilibrium in Europe, particularly in the Balkans. Additionally, they were unwilling to appease Greece, with its famously weak army and navy, at the expense of alienating Turkey.Bridge, p.166Rodogno, p.215 During the Cretan revolt of 1897 which led to the establishment of autonomy in Crete, Venizelos was a fervent proponent of union with Greece. However, during his premiership of the island, he envisioned autonomy, believing union would be premature. During his absence from power, Venizelos again changed his belief about the \\"Cretan Question\\". As in 1897, he thenceforth advocated union at all costs. Although absent from political life, he showed his support for the advocates of union (Enosis) during their demonstrations.S.B. Chester, p.85 =Theriso assembly= Gorges at Theriso. The road, which runs along the riverbed at the gorge's base, did not exist at the time of the revolt. In February 1905, Venizelos organised an assembly at Theriso with a group of seventeen other Cretan leaders who became the core of his movement. At first they were joined by 300 armed Cretans who, although not posing a significant military threat, would prove very difficult to remove, hidden in the Theriso gorge. The impact of this act was important: within twenty days, some 7,000 sympathisers had flocked to Theriso. Venizelos chose the village of Theriso for its strategic position 14 km from Chania, its naturally defenses at the foothills of the White Mountains, and its easy access to other villages and valleys, around Chania as well as toward Sfakia. The passage toward Theriso was defended by narrow gorges, easy for the insurgents to control. Moreover, these gorges concealed numerous grottoes and caverns that served as natural shelters for the insurgents who converged around Theriso. The village was already a symbol of resistance before 1905: in 1821, during the Greek War of Independence, several hundred Greeks there had routed an army of 21,000 Ottomans.C. Kerofilas, p.37 The rebellion broke out officially in broad daylight on , when some 1,500 Cretans met at Theriso, which thenceforth became the centre of the revolt. Venizelos and other prominent critics of the Prince formed the core of the revolt, along with around a thousand men, of whom only half were armed.Eleftherios Venizelos during the years of the High Commissionership of Prince George (1898–1906) From the first moments, skirmishes took place between the gendarmerie and the rebels.S.B. Chester, p.95 Aside from a general dissatisfaction with the Prince's authoritarian government, the assembled rebels fervently supported union with Greece. On the first day of the uprising, Venizelos declared that Enosis was impossible as long as Prince George remained the island's High Commissioner.P. Kitromilides, p.75 The following declaration was approved by the insurgents and read in St. George's Church at Theriso on 10 March: \\"The Cretan people, meeting in a general assembly at Theriso in Kydonia, today, 11/24 March 1905, proclaims its political union with the Kingdom of Greece, in a single free and constitutional state\\".C. Kerofilas, p.41. According to Chester, p.95, this sentence was read in French. The following day, Papagiannakis, a former deputy in the Cretan Assembly, and Konstantinos Manos, communicated to the consuls of the Great Powers, on behalf of the rebels, the reasons that had led to the revolt. They mentioned the transitional character of the present government and the eventual desire to join Greece, and cited the political instability which prevented foreign investment and hindered the island's development. Finally, they mentioned the growing general discontent because of the government's \\"nearly absolutist\\" nature.S.B. Chester, p.96 The triumvirate of the revolt: Foumis, Venizelos and Manos at Theriso in 1905 From Theriso, Venizelos organised a provisional government that printed its own postage stamps and newspaper. Papagianannakis was elected president of the insurrection's assembly and was assisted by four vice-presidents. A revolutionary triumvirate emerged: Konstantinos Foumis, a childhood friend of Venizelos' and former High Court prosecutor, as well as a member of parliament and former minister, was assigned charge of finances; Konstantinos Manos, the former mayor of Chania, handled the military aspect and held the post of general secretary; Venizelos covered the political and organisational side. Meeting during a speech by Venizelos on 25 March 1905 The opposition decided not to take part in the elections scheduled for that would choose 64 Cretan deputies (in addition to the ten directly named by Prince George).Detorakis, p.411 The Theriso insurgents called for a boycott of the elections and for an armed struggle against the regime. The new assembly, which met on 20 April at Chania, was opened by a speech from Prince George on the economy and planned reforms. However, as soon as he left the chamber, the assembly voted in favour of Enosis.S.B. Chester, p.104 In the assembly hall, entirely decorated with Greek flags, the deputies proclaimed the union of Crete with the Greek mother country and placed it under the control of King George I. They then informed the consuls of the Great Powers at Chania of this resolution. On 31 May, at the end of the parliamentary session, most of the deputies joined the Theriso Assembly. A month later, two of the prince's chief counselors, Kriaris and Koundouros (the finance minister), resigned their posts and joined their former colleague in the mountains.S.B. Chester, p.96C. Kerofilas, p.43 =Quasi civil war= Revolutionaries at Theriso Martial law was declared by Prince George, who only had 1,100 gendarmes at his disposal,J. Tulard, p.117 as well as recognition from the European powers. The presence of two parallel governments led to a near-civil war among the population, with clashes leaving several victims in the vicinity of Chania.Detorakis, p.413 At the end of April, armed encounters between gendarmes and rebels took place at Voukolies. Three rebels and two gendarmes were killed, while fifteen peasants were wounded. During the skirmishes, residents set ablaze the gendarmes' stations.S.B chester, p.103 At the beginning of August, the insurgents took the customs house at Kasteli Panormos. On the morning of 7 August, the Russian gunboat Khrabry, with 200 Imperial Guards aboard, as well as several Cretan gendarmes, laid anchor off Kastelli. Two Russian officers and an Italian lieutenant of the gendarmerie went to meet the rebels in order to engage in negotiations. The Italian gendarme ordered the insurgents to wave the white flag of surrender in the next half-hour or else face shelling. An hour and a half later, the Khrabry opened fire. This incident caused greater unrest. While Konstantinos Manos marched on Rethymno seeking to free political prisoners, insurgents attacked Koubes (west of Rethymno). The following day, Colonel Urbanovich send fifty infantrymen there to defend the position, but the Russian soldiers suffered a setback. Urbanovich himself then went to the scene leading a column of 400 soldiers. In the face of these reinforcements, the rebels had to abandon their positions and beat a retreat south to Atsipopoulo, on the heights of Rethymno. After violent combat pitting them against the Russians and the gendarmes, the Cretans ended up ceding the village to the Russians. Among the victims of the fighting were certain insurgent leaders.S.B. Chester, p.113-114 The reports of the French consul at Chania observe that, despite these events, the insurgents were not leading a systematic attack against European troops.S.B. Chester, p.114 Sophoklis at Theriso in 1905 At the beginning of summer in 1905, Prince George realised the importance of renewing dialogue with Venizelos. He wished to do so through a mutual acquaintance, James Bourchier, then correspondent in the region for The Times. At first agreeing to talks at the Theriso camp, Venizelos then declined the invitation, claiming that any cooperation with the High Commissioner was impossible. During a new parliamentary session in September, the Cretan Assembly, encouraged by the Theriso revolt, voted for several reforms taken directly from the Venizelist programme: *Abolition of the prince's prerogative to name mayors and municipal councillors; *Introduction of universal male suffrage for all municipal functions; *Abolition of the prince's prerogative to name ten Assembly deputies of his choice; *Abrogation of restrictions on freedom of the press; *Modification of the electoral laws. Before the Prince's allies had time to respond, the Assembly decided to convoke a National Assembly that could make laws regarding all the relevant issues.C. Kerofilas, p.45 The arrival of winter made life more difficult for the insurgents hiding in the mountains. Moreover, since October, the financial situation had been worrisome. In order to sustain the insurgents’ war effort, Venizelos had to take out loans. Thus, he borrowed 100,000 francs in obligations of 5 francs each in Greece.S.B. Chester, p.115Detorakis writes of 100,000 drachmas. October also saw the first defections. Rebel bands from around Sitia laid down their arms and were granted an amnesty. In mid-October, Venizelos and his comrades recognised that it would be difficult to maintain the revolt, all the more so as the latest military operations had been directly aimed at them, notably by the Russians.S.B. Chester, p.117 They gave notice that they were ready to entrust the island's fate to the Great Powers. Venizelos participated in new negotiations with the consuls, seeking to obtain a maximum of concessions regarding the island's internal affairs. In a letter addressed to the Great Powers, he stated his intention to lay down arms in exchange for honourable conditions. Most of the insurgents were ready to hand over their weapons and, for those who refused to lay down arms, it was proposed that they be transported to Greece without being disarmed. In exchange for 800 guns and the same number of cartridges, an amnesty would be possible for the insurgents, except for the gendarmes who had deserted. With these conditions, Venizelos accepted surrender. Several days later, he obtained the right to have the deserting gendarmes transported to Greece. On 25 November, the Theriso camp was broken up and an amnesty proclaimed.C. Kerofilas, p.46 =International reaction= From the beginning of the insurrection, the Great Powers' consuls based in Crete convened in numerous meetings. The reinforcement of the local gendarmerie with European troops was quickly planned.S.B. Chester, p.94 With similar speed, Prince George of Greece secured from the European powers the creation of an international corps intended to aid the Cretan gendarmerie in protecting Chania from a possible rebel attack.C; Kerofilas, p.42 The Greek government, led by Theodoros Deligiannis, opposed Venizelos' action. Deligiannis informed King George of the insurrection and Prince George of his support, and denounced \\"Venizelos' coup d'etat in Crete\\" publicly. Konstantinos Foumis Among the European nations, Russia reacted most promptly to the events. According to Venizelos' biographer Chester, the Russian conscripts were particularly cruel in their treatment of the Venizelists.S.B Chester, p.111 During March and April, a contingent of the Tsar's soldiers marched toward the Lefka Ori accompanied by Cretan gendarmes.S.B Chester, p.97 At the beginning of June, Russian troops disembarked in Crete and took several villages while the Russian fleet bombarded several others. The British, despite their support of the existing regime, only took a few symbolic actions without real impact. As for the French and the Italians, they avoided taking part in any anti-revolutionary activity. Nevertheless, an international force was assembled at Alikianos, on the road to Theriso, ready to receive orders. With the arrival of troops at Alikianos, Colonel Lubanski of the French Army organised a first meeting with the insurgents at Fournes, between Alikianos and Theriso, in a spot where the insurgents could see unmistakably the European force gathered in the valley. The talks took place on 1 April and were attended by Konstantinos Foumis and Konstantinos Manos, with Colonel Lubanski receiving the insurgents' grievances. The following day, the latter went to Theriso with a message for Venizelos: the Powers were unanimous regarding the impossibility of the island's annexation by Greece.S.B. Chester, p.98-99 After the Cretan Assembly issued its declaration of independence in April 1905, the Great Powers responded on 2 May (OS): they were determined to use their naval and ground forces if necessary to maintain order. That same day, at Heraklion, the Greek flag flying above a government building was discreetly removed by the British Army and replaced with a Cretan flag. Later however, as the Great Powers realised that Prince George had lost popular support, they arranged for negotiations. On 13 July, the insurgent leaders were invited to meet the European consuls. The following day, Venizelos, Foumis and Manos met them at a monastery near Mournies. Each leader went to the monastery accompanied by his men, who surrounded the building, but without incident.S.B. Chester, p.112 With each side remaining camped on its positions, no agreement was reached during the talks.C. Kerofilas, p.44 On 31 July, the Powers declared martial law. This measure seems to have had a minimal impact: the insurgents then controlled the entire west of the island, where order reigned, and they were ready to retreat into the White Mountains if necessary. Afterwards, the foreign troops increased their activity. The British occupied Heraklion, the Russians Rethymno, the Italians Kissamos and the French Agios Nikolaos, Sitia and Ierapetra.C. Kerofilas, p.45 At Rethymno, the Russians declared a state of siege and the measures they took were more severe than in the island's other regions. In November 1905, in response to Venizelos' letter affirming his willingness to lay down arms, the Powers agreed to significant reforms and proclaimed a general amnesty in exchange for 700–800 guns. An international commission visited the island and recommended the overhaul of the Cretan gendarmerie so that Greek officers would lead it, and the withdrawal of international forces present on the island starting in 1897.Detorakis, p.415 End of the conflict At the end of November 1905, close to 1,000 insurgents and gendarmes were transported to Greece. Nevertheless, despite their departure and the halt to the revolt called by Venizelos, Crete remained tense and the island was liable to erupt in insurrection yet again. Tensions between the supporters of each side led to conflict. For instance, when municipal elections were held and the opposition won 40 of 77 available mayoral posts, bloodshed resulted.S.B. Chester, p.118 In February 1906, the Great Powers sent a mission to evaluate Crete's administration and finances. At the end of March, the members of the commission finished their study, which they gave to the Powers. Fresh legislative elections took place in May 1906. The Prince's party won 78 seats in the assembly, while the opposition won 36. When Prince George opened the parliamentary session in July, he announced that the international commission's report had been studied by the Great Powers, who were also considering how Cretans' national aspirations could be taken into account. Strengthened in its intentions, the assembly once again voted for Crete's annexation by Greece and suspended its activities until the Powers' decision was to be made known.S.B. Chester, p.119 On 25 July, at Chania, the Great Powers announced a series of proposed reforms for the island:S.B. Chester, p.119-120 *Reform of the gendarmerie, by placing a Greek officer at its head *Creation of Cretan armed forces that would allow the definitive withdrawal of international troops *Agreement on a loan of 9,300,000 francs, two thirds of which would be devoted to public works, with the remaining third serving as an indemnity to the victims of the recent insurrections *Extension to Crete of the Greek Finance Commission (an international commission controlling Greek finances) *Creation of a commission composed of Cretans and consuls to review the expropriation of Muslim properties, lands, mosques and cemeteries *Equal rights for Christians and Muslims *Constitutional revision *Agreement on the points of disagreement with Turkey, among which were the question of the national flag, the detention of Cretan prisoners in Turkey, telegraph rates and the protection of Cretans abroad and in Turkey *A recommendation obliging the consuls to consult with local authorities on all matters of public order *A report on interest payments on a 4,000,000-franc loan through 1911 Venizelos was disposed to accept the proposals, but Prince George viewed them with hostility. In the following days, he asked for Athens to present his resignation to the Powers. His father, King George I, exercised his full powers in order to try and modify the reforms granted to the island, but the sole concession he was able to obtain was the right to choose his son's successor.S.B. Chester, p.120 In the assembly, 80 of 130 deputies, all close to the government, showed their displeasure with the idea of replacing George, a development that threatened to plunge the island anew into revolt. The closer the Prince's departure seemed, the more his allies agitated in the hope of a new European intervention. However, it was clear to the Powers this time that the situation could only improve with George's departure. On , Prince George left the island for good. Numerous sympathisers converged upon Chania to bid their goodbyes. Six hundred of these were armed, which added to the moment's tension. There was no longer any question of delaying his departure and proceeding to hold lavish ceremonies for him. He went on board the Greek battleship Psara and, while the crowd began to stir itself up, troops intervened at the same time as British soldiers disembarked.S.B. Chester, p.122 Aftermath Committee for drafting the Cretan constitution, 1906 Prince George of Greece was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis, a former Greek prime minister, for a five-year term beginning on 18 September 1906.T. Detorakis, p.416 From June 1906, an agreement between the former rebels of Theriso and the Cretan Assembly allowed for the creation of a constituent assembly led by Antonios Michelidakis. On 2 December, this body submitted a new constitution to Zaimis, who then swore allegiance to it.T. Detorakis, p.417 Order gradually returned to the island. A public administration was set up and laws passed for improving the health and education systems. In July 1907, Michelidakis was elected president of the Cretan Assembly, defeating Konstantinos Foumis by 34 to 31 votes. Impressed by the efforts the Cretan government had made, and having received assurances regarding the safety of the Muslim population, the European powers decided to send their troops home. On 26 August 1908, the first French contingents embarked at Chania, paving the way for a complete evacuation of the island.S.B Chester, p.125 Alexandros Zaimis In 1908, the Young Turk Revolution roiled the Ottoman political landscape and strained relations between Turkey and Crete. The empire's new leaders wished to abrogate the agreements adopted concerning the island's statute and reintegrate Crete into the Empire. On 10 October, taking advantage of Zaimis’ absence, the committee exercising his duties proclaimed Crete's union with Greece, an action later approved by parliament. The office of High Commissioner was abolished and the Greek constitution adopted. An executive committee met, with Venizelos at its centre holding the foreign affairs portfolio.C. Personnaz, p.64 The Greek government of Georgios Theotokis did not risk ratifying this union, but the Great Powers only protested half- heartedly, continuing their military withdrawal and completing it in June 1909. In 1913, following the First Balkan War, Crete achieved official union with Greece. The Theriso revolt established Eleftherios Venizelos’ fame in Crete and also in continental Greece; he would go on to serve as Prime Minister of Crete from April to September 1910. The following month, King George I invited him to become Prime Minister of Greece, an office he would hold seven times between 1910 and 1933. Notes References *S.

It aired on MBC from May 19 to June 8, 2007 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:40 for 16 episodes. The drama revolves around the work and romance of four airport personnel, showing the inner workings of the airline industry. It was shot almost entirely at the Incheon International Airport, and as research for the script, four writers interviewed over 200 airport personnel over a two-year stretch. Synopsis Han Do-kyung (Choi Ji-woo) was especially scouted by the Incheon Airport director and willingly accepted one-third of the pay she was receiving in Singapore, to come back to Korea as the chief of operations of Incheon International Airport. She is level-headed, speaks five different languages, and remains cool and calm under all circumstances. However, Do-kyung lives with the emotional wounds caused by her estrangement from her sister Yi-kyung, a pilot (Lee Da-hee). Do-kyung's unflappability is put to the test when she meets rash National Intelligence Service agent Kim Ji-sung (Lee Jung-jae). Acting on instinct whenever he thinks national security is at stake, he often breaks rules and ruffles feathers on the job, bringing him into constant contact, and sometimes conflict, with Do-kyung. After being stationed at the airport, he encounters doctor Seo Myung-woo (Moon Jung-hee), his ex-girlfriend who is now working at the airport clinic, with whom he parted on painful terms. Meanwhile, another airport employee is Do-kyung's childhood friend Kang Ha-joon (Lee Jin-wook). Ha-joon is quick-tempered with a habit of talking aggressively due to the nature of his job with airport security, watching over thousands of surveillance cameras. But he has a good relationship with all the airport employees, even the cleaners, because of his kind personality. As he and Do-kyung renew their friendship, he becomes a strong source of support for her. His feelings for her quickly turn romantic, despite the complication of Do-kyung being his superior at work. But Ha-joon's affections remain unrequited, because Ji-sung and Do-kyung, despite struggling with memories and misgivings from the past, find themselves falling for each other.

Classification The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the government bureau that deals with volcanism in the country classifies Malinao as a potentially active volcano. Eruptions & activities There are no historical eruptions from Malinao which is believed to have been active from about 500,000 years ago until 60,000 years ago. =1970 earthquake swarms= There was an increase in seismicity in 1970 accompanied by rumbling noises in Malinao prompting an issue of warning that the mountain might be reactivating. The tremors detected were ranging from 1 to 5 in intensity. =Small explosion in 1980= There was a minor phreatic explosion in the Naglagbong pool area in Tiwi on July 29, 1980, ejecting mud and rocks up to , reaching in height and distances up to . One person was injured and two buildings were damaged by the explosion. Prior to the event, as early as July 6, the area was experiencing unusual microseisms recorded at seismic station of the Commission on Volcanology (COMVOL) - the predecessor of PHIVOLCS - in the area. Geysering was also observed on the pool, two hours before the explosion. One theory about the cause of the explosion was water drawdown during the development of the Tiwi geothermal field.

It is commonly referred to locally as simply 'The Allt'. The Welsh name signifies 'wooded slope of the ridge'. It takes the form of a northwest-southeast aligned ridge which rises to a height of 393m (1289 feet) and which overlooks the valley of the River Usk to the west and south. To the northeast are panoramic views across Llangorse Lake to the Black Mountains There is a viewfinder on the summit erected as a monument to Eirene Lloyd White, Baroness White of Rhymney.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL13 'Brecon Beacons National Park: eastern area' It is a Marilyn with a prominence of 199 metres (653 feet). Geology The hill is formed from sandstones and mudstones of the Senni Formation (formerly the Senni Beds) of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. The lower slopes are formed from mudstones and sandstones of the slightly older St. Maughans Formation. A number of small sandstone quarries, now disused, adorn the slopes. The hill probably stood out above the Usk Valley glacier ice during the ice age. At a late stage in de-glaciation, the cols at either end of the ridge at the villages of Pennorth and Bwlch are believed to have conveyed water from a greatly enlarged Llangorse Lake into the Usk catchment.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 214 'Talgarth' & accompanying sheet explanation Access Several bridleways run along the length of the hill giving access to walker, horseriders and mountain-bikers. The summit area and the woodland to the northeast are open access for walkers. A car park off the A40 road immediately south of the hill provides a convenient starting point for many walkers. Archaeology Allt yr Esgair's summit is crowned by an Iron Age hillfort, one of several in the Usk Valley. The Roman road between the Roman fort of CICVCIVM at Y Gaer, Brecon and Gobannium at Abergavenny runs along the ridge and is followed by a modern-day bridleway.

Over of land resources are managed for quality recreational experiences as well as for protection of the project’s natural and cultural resources. Approximately 70% of the land resources are available for public hunting. Project history The creation of Milford Lake was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1954 to provide flood control, water supply, water quality, navigation, and recreation/wildlife. Construction of the Milford Dam began July 13, 1962 at mile 8.3 of the Republican River, as a project owned and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.http://corpslakes.usace.army.mil/visitors/projects.cfm?Id=G511140 The dam consists of a rolled earth fill embankment of 15 million cubic yards, with an uncontrolled spillway on the right bank. (The term \\"uncontrolled\\" refers to the lack of spillway gates such as those at Tuttle Creek Lake in Manhattan, Kansas.) Normal water storage impounds 388,000 acre- feet.http://findlakes.com/central_kansas_lakes_n38w100.htm Many contractors were involved with the project during the construction phase. Contractors built new roads and altered existing roadways, and relocated railroad facilities, city owned facilities in Wakefield and Milford, electrical, telephone, and gas lines, and cemeteries. They also built recreation areas and cleared structures from within the reservoir flood pool. The towns of Alida and Broughton ceased to exist, with houses either moved to other locations, razed, burned, or buried. The community of Alida had a major clearing contract for the removal of the Alida Cooperative grain elevator. Originally a local chiropractor sought to gain permission to develop the grain elevator into a hotel with a restaurant. Corps of Engineers studies showed that the base of the elevator would not support the structure after the lake inundated it. According to local newspaper articles, it took six separate blasts over a two- day period to bring the elevator down. The community of Broughton had two railroads that came through the town, the Rock Island from the east and the Union Pacific from the southeast. The town had a stockyard, grain elevator, post office, school, church, telephone exchange, grocery store, private homes, and a blacksmith’s shop under a large cottonwood tree. According to a local newspaper article, many men who lived in the area worked for the railroads. Even though the community is gone, an annual Broughton picnic is held for those who still remember. Portions of the cities of Wakefield and Milford were relocated to higher ground. Farms were dismantled and trees were removed from areas soon to be covered by the lake waters. Impoundment of the lake began January 16, 1967 and six months later on July 13, the multipurpose pool elevation of 1144.4 mean sea level was reached. Milford Lake’s dedication ceremony was held in May 1968. Lyndon Johnson, then President of the United States, was scheduled to appear but did not come. Over the course of the last 34 years the Milford Lake Project has provided over $921 million in flood prevention including $250 million during the 1993 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 1992 – Sept. 30, 1993). The initial cost of construction of the dam and reservoir was approximately $49,700,000. Flood history The years 1849, 1869, 1903, 1935, 1951, and 1993 all hosted record setting historical floods for the area. A flood has occurred almost every year since the first recorded flood. =Before Milford Dam= Native Americans of long ago talked of a great flood in 1781. However, the 1849 flood was one of the first major floods reported by early European settlers, with a newspaper account of an old man who was an eyewitness in his youth to the 1849 flood. He reported immense herds of buffalo being drowned and washed up into the tops of trees along the rivers. Due to a heavy frost immediately following, the buffalo carcasses were preserved long enough for the flood survivors to eat well until the spring thaw. In the spring when the carcasses began to rot, it was suspected that they were the cause of a cholera outbreak. The flood of 1869 caused a major loss of life. Reports were given of entire families being washed away while a few survivors clung to the tops of trees for hours, hoping to be saved. One story told of an infant who was tied up in a man’s shirt, and then tied to a tree surrounded by water to await rescue. Due to the swift current, nearby rescuers unable to take action were forced to listen to the child’s cries for 5 hours. Finally, when they were able to come back in a boat to rescue the child, it took all the extra men available to hold a rope tied to the boat to keep the boat from swamping and being washed away. The 1935 flood had the highest combined flow ever recorded for the Republican and Smokey Hill rivers. These two rivers meet within the city limits of Junction City, Kansas and form the Kansas River. Hours before, a cloudburst had occurred at McCook, Nebraska sending a wall of water down the Republican River. At Milford, Kansas eight boxcars were turned over and the Union Pacific Depot was washed off its site. Near Alida, Kansas the Republican River cut a new channel north of town. After the floodwater receded there was talk of trying to straighten the river channel. The Great Flood of 1951 was the last major flood in the area before the Milford Dam was built. It reportedly caused the combined total $6,500,000 in flood damages in the Fort Riley and Junction City area. After the 1951 disaster, the local newspapers were filled with articles requesting the federal government to intercede and build dams along the Republican, Smokey Hill, and Big Blue rivers. =After Milford Dam= The flood of 1993 was the first major flood to occur after the Milford Lake Dam was built. Many locals involved with fighting the flood agree that 1993 would have been much worse than the 1951 flood without the protection offered by the Milford Dam. Although flooding could not be completely stopped, the dam system and other flood protection work lessened the loss of life and property. In 1993, well above average rainfalls had been taking place throughout the entire Midwest for several months, and the ground was saturated, unable to soak up the continuing rainfall. Rivers and levees were holding the rising waters in check, but they were full. It continued to rain. Lakes along the upper and lower Missouri River Basin closed their gates so as not to add to the flooding that was beginning further downstream. The rain continued until finally the rivers, levees, and lakes could hold no more and the Great Flood of 1993 went underway, with flooding of a magnitude not seen since 1951. The Milford Dam was built to protect the Kansas River Basin. Waters from Milford Lake enter the Kansas River at Junction City, which in turn flows into the Missouri River at Kansas City. The Missouri River then empties into the Mississippi River, which transports Milford Lake waters to the Gulf of Mexico. After holding floodwaters back for weeks at the Milford Dam, and upon reaching a lake elevation above normal, the focus on flood protection changed to that of protecting the dam structures. All additional waters, which flowed in, had to be released. On July 19, 1993 the gates in the dam were fully opened to release water at a rate of . Rain continued to fall in the area and the lake continued to rise until water began to flow through the uncontrolled spillway. The design of the spillway controls the flow of the water, eventually directing it back into the river channel below the dam. For two weeks water flowed through the spillway to a maximum depth of . The continuous rush of water removed tons of soil, numerous trees, and a portion of the 244 Spur Highway. Pooling waters from the spillway flow also threatened to damage U.S. Highway 77. To protect the U.S. highway, a culvert was intentionally breached on State Highway 57 to allow the pooling floodwaters to drain back into the Republican River channel. Throughout the entire flood, the dam performed as designed and held floodwaters back, lessening the downstream flood damage. During the highest release of water through the dam, which lasted for approximately 10 hours, the riverbank channel immediately below the dam suffered some erosion damage. In the winter of 1996/7, repairs were made to the damaged channel below the dam. To prevent future damage during extremely high releases, the river channel was dropped in elevation by excavation. The removed rock was used to create a berm across the south bank washout. The channel banks were re-graded, re-rocked, and re- grouted.http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/mi/History-Flood.cfm Inhabitants =Before 1800= The Milford Lake region for the most part has been consistently inhabited. Areas with an abundance of food (both wildlife and plant life), constant water supply, moderate climate, and diverse topography have been attracting mankind throughout the ages. This is a breakdown of the people living in the Milford Lake region before the 1800s. * Paleo-Indians (Big game hunters) 8,000 – 10,000 years ago * Archaic Indians (Hunter/Gatherers) 0 – 6,000 BC * Early Ceramic (Plains Woodland) Farmed native plants. In 200 AD \\"Kansas City residents\\" grew domesticated corn. 0 – 1000 AD * Middle Ceramic (Village farmers) Beans, corn, squash introduced. At 1000 AD these people were the early ancestors of the Pawnee. 1000–1500 AD * Late Ceramic (Kaw [Kansa] arrived) late 18th century and early 19th century, and the horse was introduced by the Spanish. The French named the Kansa Indians. A map dated 1784 shows a Kansa settlement at the existing Washington Street bridge in Junction City, Kansas. 1500–1800 AD =Bogan site= Milford Lake has many recorded cultural sites both pre- and post-19th century on government lands. The one that stands out the most for its historical value is the Bogan Site. The Bogan Site was a small earthlodge village, constructed and inhabited by the Republican River Pawnee Indians. The site was most likely inhabited during the late 18th and possibly early 19th century. Due to the village’s small size and the number of artifacts recovered, the village was probably inhabited for only a short time. The village was built upon a prominent hilltop overlooking the Republican River valley, a good advantage point for defending the village from enemies. Enemies were prevalent in the area as a fortified wall surrounded the village. In 1930 a local amateur archeologist did a small amount of digging at the Bogan Site. He misidentified the legal description of the location of the site, leaving it \\"lost\\" until 1964 when the Milford Lake Project was underway. In 1964, the University of Nebraska, Laboratory of Anthropology tested the site. Then in 1967, the Kansas Historical Society's archeological division further investigated the site. This was the last archeological study done at the Bogan Site. The 1967 investigation led to the discovery that the village had been completely destroyed by a fire. Even the fortification, or palisade, was burned. Originally the fortification was built by setting posts vertically in a trench around the village. The trench was filled with dirt, stabilizing the posts. One house was excavated. The floor of the house was covered with a coating of clay. Posts, which supported the walls and the roof, were set in three circles. The inner circle had 6 posts, the middle circle had 28 posts, and the outer circle had 60 posts. The dwelling was in diameter. The framework of each house was covered with willows, thatched grass, and covered with sod. Evidence from the other two house sites indicates that they were burned as well. 81 artifacts were recovered from the Bogan Site. Six are on display in the Milford Visitor Center. It is plausible that the village was abandoned before it was completely occupied. This explains the size of the fortification and the fact that there were only three houses built. Building a fortification took lots of work and extreme effort on the part of the laborers. Trees were not abundant during this time period in Kansas, so man and horsepower probably transported the trees used to build the fortification and houses over long distances. At the time of the Bogan Site, Kansa Indians had emigrated to Kansas and were fearful enemies of the Pawnee. It is unknown whether the native Kansa burnt the village or it was destroyed by a prairie wildfire. No evidence was found of food stored in storage caches, and there were few recovered artifacts. The Pawnee may have already abandoned the village site or may have simply been gone on one of their far ranging hunts and taken all items of value with them at the time of the destruction of the village. The Bogan Site is the third Pawnee village site found along the Republican River. The other two are the Kansas Monument Site (a site near Republic, KS) and the Hill Site (a site near Red Cloud, NE).http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/index.cfm See also * List of Kansas state parks * List of lakes, reservoirs, and dams in Kansas * List of rivers of Kansas References External links Milford Lake Website *Milford Lake Brochure (PDF) *Milford Lake Map (PDF) Bodies of water of Clay County, Kansas Bodies of water of Dickinson County, Kansas Bodies of water of Geary County, Kansas Reservoirs in Kansas Dams in Kansas United States Army Corps of Engineers dams ","title":"Milford Lake"},{"id":"21103650","text":"Om Dar-B-Dar (Hindi: ओम-दर-ब-दर) is a 1988 Indian Hindi-language postmodernist film directed by Kamal Swaroop and starring Anita Kanwar, Aditya Lakhia and Gopi Desai. The film, about the adventures of a school boy named Om along with his family, is set in Ajmer and Pushkar in Rajasthan, and employs nonlinear narrative and an absurdist story line to satirise mythology, arts, politics and philosophy. The film won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie in 1989. It was never commercially released in India, though it achieved success in International Film Festivals, including Berlin where it premiered, and it soon became a cult film. In 2013, National Film Development Corporation of India (NFDC) had planned an official national release of a digitally restored print of the film. The film finally released in Indian theaters after 26 years, on 17 January 2014. Synopsis Om-Dar-B-Dar is a portrait of life in Ajmer town, Rajasthan. The film tells the story of a young boy named Om in the period of his carefree adolescence and its harsh disillusions. The story starts as a comedy and ends as a thriller. Om has a rather strange family. His father, Babuji, a government employee, leaves his job so that he can dedicate himself to astrology; Om's older sister, Gayatri, is dating a good-for-nothing fellow. Om is involved in science, but is also attracted to magic and religion. In all, it seems that his really outstanding skill is his ability to hold his breath for a long time. Cast * Anita Kanwar as Phoolkumari * Gopi Desai as Gayatri * Lalit Tiwari as Jagdish * Bhairavchandra Sharma * Lakshminarayan Shastri as Om's Father * Ramesh Mathur * Aditya Lakhia as Om * Manish Gupta as young Om * Peter Morris Messe Release The film was made on a budget of Rs. 10 lakhs. It had its premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1988, and was played at the film festival circuit and even became a cult film. However it was never commercially released in India, only as a video release. The film received renewed attention when it was screened at Experimenta, an experimental film festival in Mumbai in 2005. Thereafter, it went into a digital restoration project funded by the National Film Development Corporation of India (NFDC). Eventually, the digitally restored version was released on 17 January 2014, by PVR Cinemas in metro cities. Themes The movie was described by its director Kamal Swaroop as a story of Lord Brahma, and it sprouted from the idea that in Hinduism, although Lord Brahma was considered the father of the entire universe, strangely no one ever worshiped him. Swaroop also said that the film's script was written based solely on dreams and images that he had and claimed he \\"cannot think in words.\\" Soundtrack The songs by Swaroop's assistant, Kuku, are sporadic and choppy and don't make any logical sense, and are used tongue-in-cheek as mocking the tradition of spontaneous songs and musical numbers in Bollywood cinema, many of which don't do anything to move the story forward, but are instead used as an escapist \\"break\\" from the story line. Legacy  Although the film was never released or seen in India during its initial rounds at the film festivals, Om-Dar-B-Dar has in the past 30 years gained a huge cult following and fame amongst film critics, scholars, industry insiders and cinephiles alike. One of the first serious articles about the film was written on the film blog The Seventh Art. The blog stated, \\"Swaroop's film is an antithesis to whatever is recognized globally as Indian cinema – a reason good enough to make Om-Dar-B-Dar a must-see movie\\" and that the movie can be defined as many things, the most popular of them \\"the great Indian LSD trip.\\" The film can also be looked at as a jab at mainstream Indian cinema, and many of the themes and images in the film are direct satires of conventions of Bollywood film-making. Director Imtiaz Ali mentioned the vast amount of influence that the film had on aspiring independent directors in Indian cinema, stating that Om-Dar-B-Dar is \\"like old wine\\" and \\"antiquated because of the 25-year delay in its release\\". Director Anurag Kashyap also mentioned in his film blog that in his directorial venture Dev.D, the song \\"Emotional Attyachar\\" was inspired in its music and staging from the song \\"Meri Jaan\\" in Om-Dar-B-Dar. Producer Kiran Rao recalled watching the film on a VCD which came with a bad print and poor sound quality, yet being able to somehow stitch the missing bits in her head, which she noted was also a great way to watch a film. This film has been categorized by Amrit Gangar as a Cinema of Prayoga film.

It reunites Lawrence of Arabia co-stars Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif in a fable of friendship. Christopher Lee also plays a brief role.  Synopsis  Rudolf Von Tannen (Christopher Lee) is an eccentric millionaire who cares for no one but his dalmatians. One night he welcomes his guests - all of them related to him, expecting to cash in his fortune once he passes away - to a dinner party. The dogs are fed caviar and the people are given bones to eat. This sends them away in anger. Then Rudolf's predilect brothel service arrives, the Rainbow Girls, big-breasted women dressed with the colors of the rainbow. After dancing and partying with them, Rudolf has a heart attack that leaves him comatose. The relatives gather to argue over the will, but since Rudolf is alive but in a coma, nothing can be done. The relatives suspect that Rudolf will leave all of his fortune to his equally eccentric nephew, Meleagre (Peter O'Toole). Meleagre arrives in time to overhear the back-talk, and walks away unnoticed with his dog Chronos. Five years later, Meleagre is living in the sewers with a petty thief named Dima (Omar Sharif). Chronos has died. Together they wait for Rudolf's demise and the subsequent inheritance. Dima has set to stealing in order to make a living for the two of them, and takes advantage of carnivals and traveling circuses in order to do so. He has frequent run-ins against a bartender (played by English rock musician Ian Dury), whom he owes large amounts of money, as well as several low-life individuals (a midget, a giant, phony blind beggars) and Ambrosia, a large woman whose love he exploits for money. One night, as he escapes one of his many persecutors, he reads about Rudolf's demise, and sets out to spend his savings in a dinner with Ambrosia. However, upon close inspection of the newspaper, he finds out that Rudolf has left his entire fortune to the Rainbow Girls (as long as they take care of his dogs). Upset, Dima confronts Meleagre, feeling betrayed by him, although Meleagre argues that the fortune he once promised was not money or gold, but paradise and eternity. Outraged, Dima forsakes him and decides to leave him and the sewers for good by taking a ship to Singapore. Feeling guilty for leaving Meleagre behind, he jumps off the train and hurries back to the sewers, where his friend awaits death with his dog's corpse. The couple set to find a way out of the flooding sewerlines, but to no good. They eventually reach a ladder leading upwards. Dima manages to climb up to safety. Meleagre happily accepts his fate and hurls himself into a strong current that sweeps him away. Dima climbs up and sits catatonic in the middle of the street for hours, shocked. In the very end, as Dima walks by the docks, he spots a very much alive Chronos swimming in the water. The dog and the thief reunite and walk happily away by the pier, under a rainbow. Production notes This was Jodorowsky's fourth feature-length film, and his first British film. Filming was carried out in Gdańsk, Poland. He was frequently threatened by the producers not to change anything in the script, effectively restraining further artistic involvement on his part. (Along with Fando y Lis, this is one of only two films Jodorowsky has directed that he did not also write.) Jodorowsky has since disowned the movie. It was released in cinemas in London (May 1990), Italy (Il Ladro dell'arcobaleno, 1990), France (Le voleur d'arc-en-ciel, Paris, 1994) and, after, Spain (El ladrón del Arco iris, Cine Doré, Madrid, 2011); but it was never released in American cinemas. This movie, along with his previous Tusk in 1980, mark his most impersonal work, set far apart from his earlier films. It was discussed along with his other films in the documentary La Constellation Jodorowsky (1994).

The Battle of Tippecanoe, which had occurred just months before the war began, was one of the catalysts that caused the war. The war in the territory is often considered a continuation of Tecumseh's War, and the final struggle of the Sixty Years' War. The native tribes who were part of the battle joined forces with the British in Canada at the onset of the war. Led by future U.S. President William Henry Harrison, American forces from Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky were able to turn the tide of war on land that initially begun badly for the United States. After driving tribal forces into Canada, the American forces proceeded to invade Canada, rout the British army, and secure victory of American forces in the Northwest. Background Battle of Tippecanoe, 1811 Beginning with the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, tensions between the settlers in the Indiana Territory and the Indians began to increase dramatically. The events led to the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 6, 1811 during what is known as Tecumseh's War. In the battle William Henry Harrison led the territorial militia and army regulars against the forces of Tecumseh's Confederacy at Prophetstown. The confederacy's defeat was a major blow to their plans for a larger uprising, but left the tribes looking to outward sources of support. The British accepted an alliance with the tribes and the conflict merged with the War of 1812 in the following year.Langguth, pp. 165-168 Henry Clay and his supporters in Congress attacked and denounced the British who had supplied firearms to the western tribes and the Battle of Tippecanoe further raised tensions between the United States and Great Britain.Langguth, p. 169 Although Tecumseh publicly claimed to be at peace with the United States, he was privately encouraging his followers to prepare for war. He sent messengers to the British to attempt to stir them, reporting that the Americans were amassing troops for an invasion of Canada.Langguth, p. 171 War Years =1812= William Henry Harrison Just before the start of the war in June, Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison had left the territory for army reinforcements, leaving Secretary John Gibson to govern in his absence. As it became apparent that hostilities would soon break out, Gibson ordered the militia to organize and sent emergency riders to inform Harrison of the situation and to return him to the territory as soon as possible. July and August gave Harrison several impediments to defending Indiana. First, Chief Little Turtle died on July 14, which meant that the United States lost one of the Indian leaders they could rely on to maintain peace. This was followed three days later by British forces gaining control of Lake Michigan by the capture of the American fort at Mackinac Island. The Potawatomi allies of the British captured Fort Dearborn at what is now Chicago on August 15, massacring the defenders of the fort, including William Wells, the adopted son of Little Turtle. The British and their allies captured Fort Detroit on August 16, putting British forces on the northern border of Indiana. On August 18 the Indians led by Tecumseh refused to listen to Harrison's request for a peace council. With the impending onset of hostilities, Harrison sought military assistance from neighboring Kentucky. After being appointed brigadier general of the Kentucky militia on August 22, Harrison went to attain the force in order to defend the Indiana territorial government at Vincennes. Harrison had resigned his military commission in December 1811, but with the help of Kentucky governor Charles Scott, he was able to recruit Kentucky citizens to help defend Indiana; citizens in Ohio and Indiana had heard of the lack of camp provisions and chose not to be burdened by such hardships.Mahon pp.63,64Langguth, p. 237 It is believed Harrison sought military command due to losing popularity in the territory, particularly for supporting slavery in the territory.Mahon p.64 During September the Territorial Legislature met and Dennis Pennington introduced a bill to move the capitol from Vincennes because of its proximity to the Indians. The bill was passed and plans were put in place to begin selecting a new capitol and to evacuate the territorial records. The resolution stated: \\"Resolved: That the capitol be removed from Vincennes, because it is dangerous to continue longer here on account of threatened depredations of the Indians, who may destroy our valuable records.\\"Gresham, p. 25 Pigeon Roost September saw additional attacks across the territory. On September 3 in northern Clark County, Shawnees slaughtered the villagers of Pigeon Roost. Early September saw two separate attacks on Fort Harrison and Fort Wayne, but this time the defenders were able to repel the attack. The Siege of Fort Harrison, where the defenders were commanded by Zachary Taylor, resulted in the first land victory for American forces during the war; it was the heaviest assault the Indians threw at American defenders.Mahon p.67 Harrison himself relieved the Siege of Fort Wayne. On September 17, Harrison was given command of all American troops in the Northwest Territories as a brevet major general, replacing General James Winchester, and ordered to retake Detroit. Throughout the second half of the month Miamis continued sending emissaries to persuade the Delaware tribe to attack Americans. Mississinewa memorial The American forces struck back in November. Prophetstown was again destroyed on November 22 by General Samuel Hopkins, backed by attacking the deserted Tippecanoe River villages of the Kickapoo and Winnebago. The Battle of the Mississinewa saw forces under Colonel John B. Campbell further attack the Indians, but with his troops devastated by frostbite, Campbell took his men to Greenville. The Indians were not aided by the British in their assaults in Indiana, as the dry summer hindered efforts to send 600 British troops to Fort Wayne down the Maumee River. On December 28 Harrison resigned from his office as territorial governor; the position was not filled until Thomas Posey was given the office in April 1813. =1813= To combat the threat of Native American attacks, several companies of mounted Indiana Rangers were organized. Each company was 100 men strong. The un-uniformed troops carried their own provisions, and carried a knife and long knives to fight. These forces sought out Indian villages to avenge previous Indian attacks.Dillon pp.523,524,527 There were several skirmishes between Native Americans and Rangers, such as the Battle of Tipton's Island, but they were smaller than the major clashes of 1812. In July 1813, a large punitive expedition left Fort Vallonia and destroyed the well- developed Miami city at the confluence of the Wabash and Mississinewa Rivers. The town was deserted in advance of the army, however, and no Americans Indians were encountered during the entire expedition.Allison, 254-255 That expedition was led by Colonel William Russell 7th regiment. He and 800 mounted rangers and riflemen traveled from Ft. Vallonia to as far north as Fort Wayne burning a British and Indian fort on the Wabash River. Then traveled south to Prophetstown and setting it afire once more. The expedition then made their way back to Vincennes. Officers with Colonel Russell include Colonel Joseph Bartholomew of Indiana.Western Sun, July 1813. Papers and Documents William Henry Harrison Indiana Historical Society On May 1, 1813, the territorial legislature relocated the capitol to Corydon, Indiana, a town near Kentucky that was central within the populated portion of the territory, yet farther from the Indians than the other candidate towns. On September 29, 1813, Harrison was able to drive British forces from Detroit, forcing the British to retreat into Canada. After defeating the British again at the Battle of Thames, Harrison chose to retire to Ohio, never again to live in Indiana. Effects From the days of the American Revolutionary War to the end of the 1812 war, British agents operating from Canada had worked to instigate Native American tribes against the United States as part of an effort to create a pro-British Indian barrier state to block American expansion westward. In the Treaty of Ghent, Great Britain agreed not to arm nor trade with American Indians in the United States and dropped the proposal of a barrier state. The first decade of the 19th century was a time of relative peace between the white settlers in southern Indiana territory and the Native American nations in the rest of the territory. Although the United States hoped to acquire more of this land for settlement, it had an official policy of coexistence with the native tribes. Following the massacres and destruction of villages from 1811–13, however, the United States adopted a removal policy.Wilson, 239 The punitive actions of the War of 1812 gave the United States firm control over Indiana Territory. This led to rapid settlement and development of the territory when peace was declared, and Indiana was admitted to the Union on December 11, 1816.

Scenic Railways Company of America appellate court ruling, 4 January 1909, reported in The Atlantic Reporter (Anotated), volume 72 (West Publishing Company 1909) hilly site bounded by Baum Boulevard, North Craig Street, and Centre Avenue, and included roller coasters, picnic pavilions, carousels, a fun house, a Ferris wheel, a roller rink, a shoot-the-chutes ride, a concert shell, a dance hall, bumper cars, and a baby incubator exhibit. In its brief existence, the park featured regular performances of bands, acrobatic acts, animal acts, horse riders, and aerial acts.Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of Pennsylvania (Flagpole Books, 2002) Pittsburgh's Luna Park was the first Ingersoll park of that name (out of 44) (Luna Park, Cleveland, also owned and built by Ingersoll, opened soon afterward), and the first amusement park to be covered with electrical lighting (67,000 light bulbs). The park cost $375,000 to construct; re-creating it from scratch would cost approximately $8.5 million. The Pittsburgh and (the similar) Cleveland Luna Parks were the beginnings of the world's first amusement park chain: by 1929 (the year of Ingersoll's death), 44 Luna Parks were constructed around the world. Remnants of the entertainment empire remain, from Mexico City (the park is now called Luna Loca) to Melbourne to Athens (now called Ta Aidonakia). The cost of upgrading and maintaining his amusement parks proved too much for Ingersoll as he was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1908. Several of the Luna Parks were sold to others; Pittsburgh's park was closed in 1909 in the face of competition of a second trolley park nearby, the older (and still-existing) Kennywood Park. When Kennywood expanded its fairgrounds in 1995, its new Lost Kennywood section was patterned after its former competitor,History of Kennywood Park centered on a shoot-the-chutes ride and having a one-third- scale replica of the Luna Park entrance as a \\"gateway\\" to the park, including an era-appropriate spelling of \\"Pittsburg\\". Aside from the aforementioned tribute from Kennywood, no other remnants exist to the existence of Luna Park, including a lack of historical markers. The site itself is currently a mixed- use property with both residential and commercial businesses.

Reception A reviewer of Dusty Groove wrote \\"Sweet electric Freddie Hubbard – a wonderfully laidback session that's filled with space and soul – hardly what you'd expect from the title! The album follows nicely in the style that Hubbard hit at CTI – an openly flowing groove that has Freddie's trumpet on top of long electric piano lines from George Cables, with occasional fuller backings to flesh out the sound! Arrangements are by Dale Oehler, who's conducting a larger group behind a core quintet that also features excellent reeds from Junior Cook – possibly one of his strongest (and only) appearances on an electric date like this. Cables is the champ, though – and really makes the set cook by changing the vibe strongly with his keys – setting a tone for Freddie throughout.\\" AllMusic's Scott Yanow commented One of Freddie Hubbard's few decent efforts during his very commercial period with Columbia, this LP found his quintet (with tenor- saxophonist Junior Cook and keyboardist George Cables) joined by a small orchestra and a string section on a set of potentially dismal material.\\" Track listing # \\"Camel Rise\\" (George Cables) - 6:21 # \\"Black Maybe\\" (Wonder) - 4:55 # \\"Baraka Sasa\\" (Hubbard) - 10:26 # \\"Crisis\\" (Hubbard) - 5:45 # \\"Ebony Moonbeams\\" (Cables) - 6:57 # \\"Too High\\" (Wonder) - 6:35 Personnel *Freddie Hubbard: trumpet, flugelhorn *Junior Cook: tenor saxophone (6), flute *Dick \\"Slyde\\" Hyde, George Bohanon: trombone *Pete Christlieb: tenor saxophone (6), bass clarinet (5) *Ernie Watts: bass flute (1), flute (6), soprano saxophone (5) *Dean Parks: guitar *George Cables: electric piano *Joe Sample: clavinet, organ *Ian Underwood: synthesizer *Kent Brinkley: bass *Harvey Mason (2, 4), Ralph Penland (1, 3, 5-6): drums *Victor Feldman, King Errison, Carmelo Garcia: percussion *Dale Oehler: arrangements, conducting References Freddie Hubbard albums 1974 albums Albums produced by Paul A.

Plot Victoria had an affair with her husband Samuel's, friend, Antonio Lombardo, resulting in the birth of twins, Bruno and Raquel. Antonio also had a son, Alejandro, with his wife Adriana. After their respective spouses died, they reunited and got married. However, they didn't tell their children that they are half-siblings, as that would reveal their infidelities. Instead they raised their children to recognize each other as step-siblings. Years pass, and Bruno comes to be an irresponsible man who does not respect laws. Alejandro, on the other hand, is very responsible. Antonio prefers Alejandro over Bruno and decides that Alejandro should inherit his money when he passes away. Antonio and Victoria have a meeting at Bruno's high school about Bruno's behavior and are told that he is expelled. While leaving the school, Antonio is run over and killed. Thus begins a story of intrigue, sibling hatred and rivalry, two sons in love with and fighting for the love of the same women, corporate espionage, and twin sisters torn apart by circumstance.

The band's brittle, off-kilter sound evoked the sense of distance, desolation, harshness and loneliness of the Nullarbor Plain (but also its fragile nature), much in the same fashion as fellow Perth outfit The Triffids. Biography The Snarskis were born in London, to Polish refugee parents, and grew up on a 36 hectare farm on the outskirts of Perth, Western Australia. Their teenage musical passions were shared – Explosive Hits '77, the Doors, the Velvet Underground, Television. The band relocated to Sydney in 1984, the remainder of the band followed some months later in James Hurst's kombi. In 1985 Amanda Brown (The Go-Betweens) was asked to record with the band (she appears on two tracks on the band's debut album Buckle in the Rail) and was invited to join the band. In the end she rejected the offer and became a permanent member of The Go-Betweens. Chad's Tree supported not only John Cale in their first year, but also Nico, at the Prince of Wales in St Kilda, shortly after they moved east in the mid-1980s Chad's Tree issued its debut 7-inch single \\"Crush the Lily\\"/\\"Toll for Josephine\\" in November 1985 on the Hot label. They released subsequent singles, \\"Sweet Jesus Blue Eyes\\"/\\"To the Highest Bidder\\" in February 1987 and \\"Stroller in the Attic\\"/\\"The Orchard\\" in March 1988, as well as their debut album Buckle in the Rail in January 1987 on the Nude label. The \\"Crush the Lily\\" and \\"Sweet Jesus Blue Eyes\\" singles were also combined on the four-track, 12-inch EP Chad's Tree for release in the United Kingdom through Rough Trade Records. There were a number of different line-ups over the course of six years. As well as Kim Bettenay, the band's bass players included Mark Hemery, Peter Michael, Barry Turnbull and Simon Kain. Susan Grigg joined on piano and violin in 1987, and was replaced by Kathy Wemyss in 1989. Jason Kain (lead guitar, ex-Wet Taxis) also replaced Robert Snarski, who returned to Perth in October 1988 and went on to form The Blackeyed Susans The band issued a second album, Kerosene, in March 1989. After the band broke up Mark Snarski and Wemyss formed the Jackson Code. After touring with American crime writer James Ellroy in 1996, Mark left Australia for Europe finally settling in Madrid. Rob Snarski lives in Melbourne, where he joined and is a pivotal member of The Blackeyed Susans. In March 2010 Memorandum Records released a compilation album, Crossing Off the Miles, which included both studio albums, all the band's single and B-sides, together with eleven early demos and live recordings. The release also included a 32-page booklet with photos and liner notes from eight contributors including both Rob and Mark Snarski, authors Niall Lucy and David Nichols and band insiders. =Members= * Mark Snarski – vocals * Rob Snarski – vocals, guitar, bass * Jason Kain – guitar * Kathy Wemyss – vocals, violin, trumpet * James Hurst – drums * Kenny Davis Junior – violin * Sue Grigg – violin, piano * Amanda Brown – violin * Rodney Howard – bass * Peter Michael – bass * Kim Bettenay – bass * Barry Turnbull – bass * Mark Hemery – bass * Simon Kain – bass Discography =Albums/EPs= * Chad's Tree (EP) – Hot Records (HOT 1229) (1986) * Buckle in the Rail – Nude Records (Fine 1) (January 1987)Discogs – Buckle in the Rail * Kerosene – Nude Records (DAMP96) (March 1989) * Crossing Off the Miles – Memorandum Records (MEMO7) (22 March 2010) =Singles= * \\"Crush The Lily\\" / \\"Toll For Josephine\\" – Hot Records (HOT 727) (November 1985) * \\"Sweet Jesus Blue Eyes\\" / \\"To The Highest Bidder\\" – Nude Records (FIG 100) (February 1987)Music Stack – Sweet Jesus Blue Eyes * \\"The Orchard\\" / \\"Stroller in the Attic\\" – Nude Records (FIG 110) (March 1988)Music Stack – The Orchard =Compilations= * This Is Too Hot – Hot Records (1986) – \\"Crush The Lily\\"Discogs – This Is Too Hot * High Temperature: A Collection Of Hot Records From 1982 – 1985 – Hot Records (1986) – \\"Crush the Lily\\"Discogs – High Temperature: A Collection Of Hot Records From 1982 – 1985 References External links * AMO Artist profile – Snarski & Luscombe * Chad's Tree @ musicbrainz * Chad's Tree @ discogs * Crossing Off The Miles CD review * Rate Your Music – Chad's Tree Discography * Record cover art at prehistoricsounds.com Australian indie rock groups Western Australian musical groups Musical groups established in 1983 Musical groups disestablished in 1989 ","title":"Chad's Tree"},{"id":"21103753","text":"Guan is a surname.

The story follows the life of Azoth (later Kylar Stern) as he struggles as a guild rat to become the ultimate wetboy (an assassin with magical talent, such as the ability to muffle sound or to block an attack), but then tries to leave it all behind and finally becomes the avatar of retribution: the Night Angel. Plot summary For a detailed synopsis of the novels, see the relevant article for each book Series # The Way of Shadows # Shadow's Edge # Beyond the Shadows # Prequel: The Perfect Shadow =Characters in the series= =Setting= The story is set on the continent of Midcyru, mainly in the country of Cenaria and in its capital city which shares the same name. Magic =The Talent= The Talent is the magic most commonly used in Midcyru. Talented individuals must have three different components to be able to express their Talent outwardly. The first is their Glore Vyrden, or life magic. This is the reserve that stores the power that can be directed as the user wishes. The second component is the ability to refill one's glore vyrden when it is empty - if one does not possess it, then one can use magic only once or twice during one's whole life. A person with such an ability usually replenishes the glore vyrden by absorbing sunlight or light from other sources. The final component is a conduit allowing the use of one's glore vyrden however one desires. This conduit can be small or blocked, limiting the maximum amount of magic one can use at a single time. A nonexistent conduit, large glore vyrden and the ability to absorb large amounts of energy through the skin and eyes are the signs of a ka'karifer, one ready to bond and use the ka'kari artifacts. Also, people who are ka'karifers can call out to ka'kari, but once they bond, they cannot do so anymore. Magus and Maja In the series, a male mage is called a Magus, with Magi as its plural form. A Maja is a female mage, with Magae as its plural form. Red Magi Red Magi tend to use fire magic. Solonariwan Tofusin is a Sethi red mage in line for the throne and is very Talented, considered to be one of the strongest red mages of his time. Green Magi Green Magi are healers. Dorian Ursuul trained with the Green Magi in an attempt to use healing magic to possibly save him from the inevitable madness that afflicts all prophets, achieving the rank of Hoth'Salar (Brother of Healing). Brown Magi Also known as the Makers, the Brown Magi specialize in the creation of magical artifacts. Feir Cousat is an example of a Brown Mage. Ka'karifers Ka'karifers are those who use a ka'kari. These people have no conduit for their Talent, but the ka'kari provides them with one if they bond with one of the seven. In this case, a ka'karifer is someone who calls a ka'kari. However, if the ka'kari ever leaves the ka'karifer, as in the case of Durzo Blint, the conduit remains. Known ka'karifers include: * Arikus Daadrul * Corvaer Blackwell * Trace Arvagulania * Oren Razin * Irenaea Blochwei * Shrad Marden * Acaelus Thorne/Durzo Blint * Kylar Stern/Azoth =Vir= The vir is used by Meisters, Vürdmeisters and the Ursuul family. Vir users are also referred to as wytches, though this term insults them. The prayer that the Khalidorians say to their goddess is actually a spell that empties a small portion of their glore vyrden into her \\"reservoir\\" of magic; she then returns however much she desires back to them as vir. Like the Talent, it can act as an extension of the physical being. The difference between vir and Talent is that the vir is living, and has a measure of sentience, mostly because it is part of Khali. Many Meisters and Vürdmeisters who find themselves in harm's way will be protected by it unintentionally. It is described as a magical parasite. It opens new channels in the user's Talent, so initially a vir user will have stronger Talent, but the vir eventually consumes all the user's Talent permanently. A Meister's or Vürdmeister's strength in the vir is measured in shu'ra. There are thirteen shu'ra; however, only the Godking can attain the thirteenth. The vir appears on a Meister as a black, living tattoo of vines on the body of a Meister. The strength of a Meister's vir is shown by the amount of vir on his or her body, and the intricacy of the tattoos represents his or her mastery of the vir. Usually only the wytch's arms show vir, but stronger vir users, such as Dorian and Garoth Ursuul, are almost completely covered in vir when they choose to display it. The Ursuuls are the only Meisters who can hide their vir and bring it to the surface of their bodies at will. According to Neph Dada, the Ursuuls are also capable of removing access to the vir from another wytch. Curoch also has the power to destroy the vir contained in a wytch's body and does so in a small but violent concussive explosion. The Ursuul family's hidden vir can be stopped by stopping the physical expression of it, which appears to be the only weakness of their ability to hide their vir. While the Ursuuls can control the vir and who is able to use it, Khali controls the reservoir of vir and talent, which allows her to decide the level of a wytch's power. Meisters Meisters are the lowest rank and most common users of the vir, and they are never above the tenth shu'ra. They usually do not display much of the vir on their arms or the rest of their bodies. All ranking officials in Khalidor are at least Meisters, but most offices do not appear to take strength into great consideration. For example, Godking Wanhope's Keeper of the Dead is only a meister of the third shu'ra. Vürdmeisters Vürdmeisters are more powerful meisters. To become a Vürdmeister, a meister must pass at least the 10th shu'ra. Vürdmeisters are able to effectuate summons, such as the Pit Wyrm, while most meisters appear not to be able to. Neph Dada is a Vürdmeister. =Magical artifacts= Ka'kari Created by Ezra the Mad, based on the Black ka'kari that he discovered, and given to the Six Champions. They are described as glowing, metallic balls. When the user desires, the ka'kari covers their body like a second skin and gives them power over a specific element. This is activated by crushing said metallic ball which becomes a liquid and then covers the body. They also grant the user immortality, although they can still be killed in a way unaffiliated with the powers of their ka'kari. For example, while the bearer of the silver ka'kari is completely impervious to blades and metal weapons, he or she could easily be drowned or burned to death. The only known way of completely destroying a ka'kari is with the sword Curoch, as demonstrated by Kylar's destruction of the white ka'kari. However, while discussing the ka'kari with Garoth Ursuul, Neph Dada states that he believes a high amount of elemental power could be used to damage the ka'kari, and that this may have happened to the red and blue ka'kari. =Black Ka'kari= The original ka'kari, found by Ezra. He tried to replicate it but was only able to make inferior copies. Not much is known about it, but it is ancient and extremely powerful. It is sentient in nature, able to engage in small talk with Kylar and Durzo, as well as offer them advice. Furthermore, it also has a sarcastic sense of humor, similar to Durzo's, presumably from spending seven hundred years with him. The black ka'kari, like all ka'kari, chooses its user. The black ka'kari chose Acaleus Thorne and Kylar Stern because of their love of companionship, as the black ka'kari's abilities are based on love. It chose Acaelus Thorne over Ezra and Jorsin Alkestes, as Acaelus lived for the brotherhood shared in battle. After Durzo chose to let Vonda, a woman he was involved with die, the ka'kari abandoned him, as his ability to love was gone. It is known as the Devourer and the Sustainer; it devours everything it touches, including magic, items or clothing, except for the bearer (And certain rare magical items such as Iures the Staff of Law, and Curoch the Sword of Power). The black ka'kari allows the bearer to become perfectly invisible to everyone except mages. It is also able to bring the bearer back to life after being killed. In doing so, the sacrifice of new life is ending another's, this person being someone the bearer loved, either as friend or loved one. This death is not immediate but it is imminent. It is also a known fact that whoever is the wielder of the Black Ka'kari is known as the Night Angel who serves Vengeance, Justice, and Mercy culminating as the Avatar of Retribution. The black ka'kari's powers are vast and while most of them have been explained several of them are not. Its other abilities are: accelerated healing, the ability to see through shadows, the ability to dissipate a talent users weaves and(or) talent {\\"...she gathered her full strength; he blew in her face. Her Talent scattered as if that puff had been a hurricane...\\" Kylar confronting Istariel in her office}, the ability to see into the magical spectrum, the ability to see the Coranti {the unclean - sins or injustices that a person has committed}, and to transfer any thing it devours to its bearer as magical energy to restore their glore vyrden. Of these powers; accelerated healing and the ability to see through shadows remain to the user whether he is in possession of the ka'kari or not. It is unclear as to what powers remain to the a person whom the ka'kari abandons, but it could be speculated that the ability to see through shadows remains as Durzo has never had a problem navigating through a place of total darkness; even after the ka'kari had abandoned him as is evident from him easily moving through the tunnels to the nine's meeting spot without the use of a light source and there is no point when Durzo takes enough harm to tell if he still has the benefit of the accelerated healing though due to one having the ability while not in possession of the ka'kari would suggest that he does. =Silver Ka'kari= Originally given to Arikus (Eric according to the latest released novella \\"Perfect Shadow\\") Daadrul. Once bonded, the silver ka'kari makes the user impervious to blades and other metals. The Globe of Edges in Cenaria was thought to be the silver ka'kari, but was a forgery. This could be the item that Garoth Ursuul wanted but is never made specific. The current location of the silver ka'kari remains unknown. =Red Ka'kari= Originally given to Corvaer Blackwell, also known as Corvaer the Red. Once bonded, the red ka'kari gives the user power over fire. It was hidden inside Mount Tenji by Durzo Blint in an attempt to keep it away from the Wolf. This action turned Mount Tenji into an active volcano. =White Ka'kari= Originally given to Trace Avagulania. Once bonded, the white ka'kari gives the user the power of glamour. Glamour being defined as a weave to give the bearer an illusion to others, and in this case, the glamour of the white ka'kari was so powerful that it could be used to create an irresistible compulsion in others. Trace, reputed to be horribly ugly, became the most beautiful woman ever seen. Using the power given to her by the ka'kari, she became the Khalidorian goddess Khali. This ka'kari was destroyed when Kylar used Curoch to kill Khali. =Brown Ka'kari= Originally given to Oren Razin. Once bonded, the brown ka'kari gives the user power over the earth. The user can become a thousand-pound brute with skin made of stone. A much younger Durzo Blint gave it to the Wolf before deciding he needed to keep the artifacts safe from the Wolf. =Green Ka'kari= Originally given to Irenaea Blochwei. Once bonded, the green ka'kari gives the user power over plant life. It is believed to be somewhere in Ladesh. However, it is possible that this ka'kari was thrown into Ezra's wood, as Durzo states he threw two ka'kari into the wood, and all other ka'kari are accounted for. =Blue Ka'kari= Originally given to Shrad Marden. Once bonded, the blue ka'kari gives the user power over water. It also is said to allow the user to drain the liquid from a man's blood. It was thrown into the ocean by Durzo Blint, which created the Tlaxini Maelstrom. Iures (The Staff of Law) Created by Jorsin Alkestes and Ezra the day before Jorsin's demise, it is the companion to Curoch. Iures differs from Curoch in that it grants no additional power, but instead allows the wielder to focus his or her power to an extreme degree, allowing them to create or undo extremely complicated weaves with ease. It also has the power to record any weaves created near it and it remembers those weaves forever. Like Curoch, the wielder can also change Iures' appearance and shape at will. Durzo Blint and Kylar both use Iures disguised as the sword Retribution. The location of Iures is not explicitly stated at the end of the trilogy, but it is highly likely that the Dark Hunter has it in Ezra's Wood. Ceur'caelestos (The Blade of Heaven) Ceur'caelestos, or Blade of Heaven, is the Ceuran's legendary sword. Ceuran Law states that the bearer of the Blade of Heaven is King of Ceura. The sword is made of pure mistarille. There is a dragon on each side of the blade with a gap at the mouth, from which fire is produced whenever danger or magic is near. On the hilt there is a mark of two crossed war hammers. The hilt also contains a very large and pure red ruby. It first appears when Feir is running from Lantano Garuwashi and he has to confront him with Curoch. Curoch takes on the appearance of this blade (and it is suggested that Curoch, through its inherent shapeshifting abilities, may very well be the original Ceur'caelestos), and Lantano Garuwashi subsequently takes it from Feir. Kylar then steals the blade and throws it into Ezra's Wood. Feir enters the Wood to retrieve it, and receives instructions on how to recreate Ceur'caelestos. He then travels to Black Barrow and forges a perfect replica of the sword; save for Feir hiding his own smithing symbol near the base of the blade, which he gives to Garuwashi. However, the replica does not breathe fire like the original, as Feir cannot find a ruby to bind the necessary magic into. Immediately before the inspection of the sword by a Ceuran mage, Solon brings a suitable ruby to Garuwashi, completing the sword in truth, and causing it to gain the ability to breathe fire. The inspection reveals Feir's symbol, which according to the document is supposed to be on the blade. Thus, Ceur'caelestos existed only as a legend before Feir forged it. Curoch (The Blade of Power) Created by Jorsin Alkestes and Ezra, Curoch is the partner blade to Iures. Like Iures, Curoch can take any form that the bearer wishes, as Neph Dada demonstrated in the Hall of Winds. However, while Iures gives the bearer greater control over magic (allowing them to create or undo weaves with greater precision) Curoch amplifies the bearer's power to an extreme degree. With the vast majority of mages, this amplification exceeds what the bearer's body can handle, with only the strongest mages in the trilogy being capable of handling Curoch even at its lowest levels of power. The two best examples of Curoch's power are when Solon Tofusin used it to kill all the meisters using their vir during Roth's coup in Cenaria, when Jorsin Alkestes used it to blow apart the magic that was giving the krul form in the Alkestian Cycle (an era predating the time in which the Trilogy is set), and when Kylar uses Curoch to kill Neph Dada, euthanise Elene, and kill Khali, who was possessing her at the time. Curoch is also responsible for the destruction of the vir as it destroyed Khali, the goddess who supplied the vir to the Khalidorians. Curoch is the blade that Lantano Garuwashi originally believed to be the Blade of Heaven. Although the dark hunter appears to have taken Curoch at the end of the final book, it was prophesied by Dorian that there is one meant to wield Curoch, but this person has yet to come. This could refer to a child of Kylar and Elene, as it is implied that Dorian magically transferred the child from Elene to Jenine before her death. However, it could also refer to a child of Dorian and Jenine, as this would be a child of the only true Prophet, the most powerful Healer of the age, and the High Queen. Also, as mentioned by the author, there will be a series set seventeen years after the events of Beyond The Shadows. Curoch is also the only weapon known that is able to truly kill the bearer of the Black Ka'kari. Black Ka'kari to Kylar \\"...By the way, Jorsin Alkestes didn't like the idea of his enemies coming back to life. If that sword kills you, you're really dead.\\" Politics = Legitimate rulers= High King The prophesied king to become ruler of all Midcryu. He was born on a special day and has the mark of a moon dragon on his arm (what the mark is was ambiguous in the prophecy. The other contender simply had a tattoo on his arm). Logan Gyre assumes the title of High King, becoming the overlord of Khalidor, Lodricar, Cenaria and Ceura. Godking The ruler of Khalidor from the Ursuul bloodline. Godkings are the only meisters capable of reaching the thirteenth shu'ra. They have a high degree of control over the vir and are able to rip out the vir of other meisters. Royal titles Most of Midcyru's countries are monarchies ruled by kings (Cenaria, Friaku), queens (Waeddryn), emperors (Seth) or regents (Ceura). Or the Godking in Khalidor. =Criminal Underworld=  Sa'kagé (The Lord Of Shadow)  The Sa'kagé are the criminal underworld of various cities across Midcyru, the most powerful and evident one being Cenaria's and the least powerful being in Caernarvon. It is represented inconographically by an eye with a heavy lid drawn in one complete gesture. In Cenaria they control all of the crime in the city, including the prostitution, smuggling, assassinations, the guilds, etc. In the first book Durzo Blint is also controlled by the Cenarian Sa'kage. They are also the reason that Khalidor didn't invade Cenaria straight away, the Sa'Kage controlled everything and the royalty controlled next to nothing, Khalidor wanted to control the Sa'Kage to allow them to take Cenaria in a single attack. The word \\"Kagé\\" means the Shadow. Sa'kagé means Lords of the Shadow. Originally part of an oath Acaelus Thorne gave to Jorsin Alkestes, who claimed that the oath was as old as the Night Angels themselves, the term Sa'Kage has been stolen by the criminals who run Cenaria and are in every other country (apparently except for Ymmur although it has not been mentioned) in a bid to tell people that they were the lords of the night and not the night angels Shinga The Shinga is the head of the Sa'kagé, and is iconographically represented by a nine pointed star. Momma K was the Cenarian Shinga for over fifteen years, hiding behind various puppet Shingas to keep her identity a secret. She gave up her title to Jarl, who declared himself Shinga and was supported by Momma K. Consequently, many of those who knew the identity of the real Shinga thought Jarl was only another puppet. After Jarl's assassination, Momma K assumes the role of Shinga again, while conspiring with Logan Gyre to get rid of the Sa'kagé at the same time. The Nine The council to the Cenarian Shinga, consisting of the nine most important Sa'kagé members. The Nine and the wetboys are the only people who know the true Shinga's identity. While it is intimated that each of the nine has an actual title, not all of the titles or positions they hold are put forth. The Master of Coin (a position held at one point by Count Drake) and the Mistress of Pleasures (Momma K) are explicitly named, but some of the others are only mentioned in accordance with their duties. A smuggling master is mentioned (he was killed by Durzo), Corbin Fishill was said to be the head of the children's guilds (also killed by Durzo), and another man was said to be the head of the bashers (although no name was given). Wetboys \\"Wetboys are to assassins like a tiger is to a kitten.\\" - Kylar \\"That's why assassins have targets. Wetboys have deaders. Why do we call them deaders? Because when we take a contract, the rest of their short lives is a formality.\\" - Durzo Wetboys are unparalleled killers, the elite of the elite when it comes to assassination in Cenaria. While assassins and assassination in general are commonplace in Cenaria, what distinguishes the true wetboys is not their improved skill at hiding, sneaking, killing, or any of these things. They may be more talented at killing, but what actually makes the distinction is that the true wetboys (Durzo Blint, Scarred Wrable, Hu Gibbet, Anders Gurka, and Jonus Severing are named) have the Talent: magical ability that greatly enhances their prowess in different ways. In general, the Talent enhances their physical abilities to an extreme degree, but it also allows them to do things like bend light to hide in the shadows, create phantom limbs for attack or defense, and cling to vertical surfaces, to name a few. Durzo displays a far greater range of abilities than any of the others, but his Talent was correspondingly more powerful than nearly any of the other characters shown in the series, along with the nearly 700 years of knowledge and experience he had to work with. While the wetboys in the series tend to be loyal only to themselves and to the contracts they are paid to perform, their Talent allows them to swear a magically binding oath to the Shinga, something they are compelled to do early on. This is a safety measure for the Shinga, for as Durzo puts it: \\"Shingas who aren't paranoid don't live very long.\\" The oath and corresponding magical compulsion are relatively weak, but to remove it entirely the wetboy would have to submit themselves to a mage (every mage in Cenaria is under the control of the Sa'Kage) or a meister (Durzo again: \\"...only an idiot would submit to a meister\\"). Thus, the extreme danger the wetboys present is somewhat balanced. However, Kylar and Durzo are the only two wetboys never made to swear this oath. Religion =The Hundred Gods= Most peoples of Midcyru believe in the Hundred Gods or at least in some of them. Priests to the Hundred Gods are called hecatonarchs. Nysos is the deity of potent liquids, including blood, wine, and semen. He is often worshipped by wetboys and is likely derived from the Greek Dionysos, who holds a similar position in the Greek pantheon. =The One God= The One God is never referred to as being the god of any particular religion, and characters throughout the series that worship The One God are also never referred to as being part of any particular religion. The One God's name affirms that it is a Monotheist religion. There are similarities that The One God shares with the God that is worshiped in many religions today. (Particularly the Christian God, as Elene once spoke from actual scripture that is located in the Holy Bible.) The One God is also referred to many times as just \\"God\\". In one section of the novel, Godking Wanhope appears to have a short argument with The One God, possibly validating his existence in the story. However, this argument could simply be seen as a sign of Wanhope's decaying mental state. =Khali= Worshipped by the people of Khalidor. Dorian believed that she was a fallen angel who roamed the earth. It turns out that Khali is Trace, the bearer of the white ka'kari; however, the relation between Khali and the Strangers isn't totally clear. Dorian said that Khali was just an ally of the strangers. Trace may have allied herself with one of the Strangers when Durzo used the black ka'kari's magic to kill her. Khali uses the power of the Ka'kari's compulsion powers to control Khalidor and others. Vürdmeisters' summoning magic There are many creatures that are only created by Vurdmeisters. =Ferali= A Ferali is a fearsome and terrible creature created from the bodies and souls of tortured prisoners and controlled with diamonds thrust into its \\"back\\". A ferali has the ability to absorb living creatures into its body and use the bones and tissue to become larger and more powerful. It is covered in mouths that will trap and consume a victim alive after even the slightest contact. A ferali is not bound to one shape but can change to any shape it pleases as to use the bones more effectively. When a ferali is created then the creator must host a stranger. Garoth Ursuul hosts two strangers, Lust and Pride. They are fearsome in battle as most magic is simply deflected and any wound heals instantly. A ferali can be \\"ridden\\" or possessed by a powerful user of vir and used against his enemies. If a ferali is not consuming others it will consume itself, and eventually die. Two of the Ferali in the Trilogy are Tatts and Lily, both prisoners from the deepest level of the Maw, the Hole. Kylar Stern loses an arm to a ferali before it is killed. Although the ferali is impervious to most magic, a powerful spell of a complicated weave is capable of destroying the negatory magic they seem to possess. An example of this is when Dorian, a magi skilled with complicated weaves, destroyed a ferali with one spell that took only several seconds to create. It is also susceptible to the powers of the Devourer—the Black Ka'kari—which if used to attack the Ferali will negate its ability to heal itself. =Krul= Krul are created by binding the spirit of demons known as Strangers into human bones. A krul is like a zombie in that it doesn't feel pain or fear and can be raised again after being killed, however, a krul needs to eat to sustain its energy. The bones do not have to be in human shape, however, and many krul have been created by placing human bones into the shape of a horse or dog. This is more difficult, however, because they wish to be in the form of a human, not an animal. Then, if they are given clay and water, they can form muscle, flesh, and ligaments around the bones. Once they are formed, they become living beings. They eat, they sleep, and they defecate. They do not feel as other creatures do. Krul can speak, but not very well. They can see better in the dark, but they cannot see as far, presumably because eyes are difficult to create. As such they are poor archers. While they can feel fear, they almost never do because they know that if their physical body dies that they will most likely be remade sometime in the future. A krul is almost perfectly obedient. They have a powerful hate toward the living, powerful enough that it overrides their sense of self- preservation. If a krul is locked in a room with a person, and are told that if they kill the person that they will die as well, the krul will always choose to kill and die in turn. This was carried out with both men and women, even children. The krul cannot create anything, even weapons of war. They only exist to destroy. They eat human flesh, and it seems to make them stronger. The Strangers use a base 13 number system and it confines the krul to a certain order. A meister can lead 12 krul himself, but to lead 13, he must master a white krul called daemon. Daemons are fast, over 6 feet tall, and take more magic to create. 13 krul form a squad. A platoon is composed of 13 squads, or 169 krul and therefore 13 daemons. To control the 13 daemons a bone lord must be raised. The bone lords speak well, they possess more intelligence and they can used talent-based magic. 13 bone lords make a legion, to control a legion a fiend must be raised. 13 fiends make an army, which is 28,561 krul. To lead an army, the raising of an arcanghul is necessary. To lead 13 armies, a Night Lord must be raised. It is said that with a Night Lord, Khalidor conquered most of the Freeze. Legend says that when Roygaris Ursuul had raised 13 Night Lords, slaughtering almost 5 million people, Khali came into the world. =Ferozi= Yet another foul creature that can be conjured by meisters, the ferozi are only mentioned by name. Presumably less powerful than the ferali, it is mentioned that the ferozi can breed with one another so there must be genders of ferozi =Titan= A Titan is a huge creature possessed by a Stranger. Like krul, Titans can be raised over and over by meisters. Titans look like blue-skinned men from the front, with huge leathery wings, spikes along their spine, and a rat-like tail. In battle, they are surrounded by Red strangers referred to as fire ants or buulgari or the bugs. The Fire ants fight with very sophisticated techniques. =Pit wyrm= A pit wyrm can be summoned by a Vürdmeister of sufficient power. The wyrm is preceded by a small white flying homunculus which is released on the target. After several seconds, the fabric of space is ripped apart and the wyrm appears to devour the homunculus and anything around it. The wyrm itself is difficult to destroy as its skin seems to be impervious to normal weapons and it moves rapidly and fiercely, however, the homunculus can be misdirected so that the wyrm doesn't do the intended damage. A direct confrontation between pit wyrm and ferali at Pavvil's Grove has shown that a grown-out ferali can defeat a pit wyrm; a ferali can defeat almost any other 'creature' in midcyru. Lantano Garuwashi also uses Curoch to cut a pit wyrm in half.

She was a Royal Line ship under charter to the Uranium Line at the time of the fire. After the ship issued SOS signals, eleven ships came to her aid and, in heavy seas and gale winds, rescued 521 passengers and crewmen. 135 people, most of them women and children in lifeboats launched unsuccessfully prior to the arrival of the rescue ships, died in the incident. Volturno was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan and completed in November 1906.  Fire and sinking  William Shackleton Volturno, on a voyage from Rotterdam to New York City, was carrying a mixed load of passengers, mostly immigrants, and cargo that included highly flammable chemicals.http://fireontheocean.com/about-ss-volturno/ At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, it caught fire during a gale in the North Atlantic at . The cargo hold in the front of the ship was engulfed in flames. Shortly afterwards, some of the cargo exploded. The fire spread to the ship's coal bunkers, cutting power to the fire pumps. The crew fought the fire for about two hours but, realising the severity of the fire and the limited options for dousing it, Captain Francis Inch radioed an SOS. Eleven ships responded to the ship's reported position, arriving throughout the day and into the next. Meanwhile, several lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched; all either capsized or were smashed by the ship's hull, leaving no one alive from the first boats. Captain James Clayton Barr of , the first ship to arrive, at around noon, took command of the rescue effort. Barr had the other nine vessels form a \\"battle line\\" and slowly circle the burning ship. Throughout the night of 11 October, Carmania kept one of her searchlights on Volturno, with another sweeping the ring of rescue ships to help them avoid collisions. According to one passenger, despite Carmanias efforts, two of the ships, the Red Star liner and the French Line steamer almost collided, coming within . This was disputed by an officer on the Kroonland. The rescue ships launched lifeboats of their own, but rough seas and the reluctance of Volturnos passengers to jump into the frigid water hampered rescue efforts. On board Volturno, the crew and some male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds over which the others on board were gathered. However, shortly before dawn, there was a large explosion, probably of the boilers. The rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking, would founder at any time. In the early morning of 11 October, the tanker SS Narragansett, one of the eleven rescue vessels, turned on her pumps and sprayed oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combination of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be launched. With all lifeboats recovered by 09:00, the rescue ships resumed their original courses. In all, 521 passengers and crew members were rescued by ten of the eleven ships. The death toll was 135, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings. On the night of 17 October, the Dutch tanker , unaware of the events of the week before, came upon the still-smoldering hulk of Volturno. Charlois lowered a boat that stood by, attempting to hail any possible survivors on board. When day broke on 18 October, Captain Schmidt saw the full extent of the damage. Seeing that Volturno was a hazard to passing ships, he ordered Volturnos seacocks opened, scuttling the ship.Spurgeon, pp. 66–68.

Antibacterial activity  Salinomycin and its derivatives exhibit high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including the most problematic bacteria strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Salinomycin is inactive against fungi such as Candida and Gram- negative bacteria.  Cancer research  =Pre-clinical= Salinomycin has been shown by Piyush Gupta et al. of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute to kill breast cancer stem cells in mice at least 100 times more effectively than the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel. The study screened 16,000 different chemical compounds and found that only a small subset, including salinomycin and etoposide, targeted cancer stem cells responsible for metastasis and relapse. The mechanism of action by which salinomycin kills cancer stem cells remains unknown, but is thought to be due to its action as a potassium ionophore due to the detection of nigericin in the same compound screen. Studies performed in 2011 showed that salinomycin could induce apoptosis of human cancer cells. Promising results from a few clinical pilot studies reveal that salinomycin is able to effectively eliminate cancer stem cells and to induce partial clinical regression of heavily pretreated and therapy-resistant cancers. The ability of salinomycin to kill both cancer stem cells and therapy-resistant cancer cells may define the compound as a novel and an effective anticancer drug.C. Naujokat, R.

Use in agriculture  Salinomycin is used in chicken feed as a coccidiostat.  Biosynthesis  A team from the University of Cambridge has cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic cluster responsible for salinomycin production, from Streptomyces albus DSM 41398. This has shown that the polyketide backbone of salinomycin is synthesised on an assembly line of nine polyketide synthase) multienzymes. Furthermore, the cluster contains genes involved in oxidative cyclization including salC (epoxidase) and salBI/BII/BIII (epoxide hydrolase) genes. The cluster also contains genes suspected to be involved in self-resistance, export, precursor supply and regulation. The cluster contains a NRPS-like carrier protein, SalX, that is suspected to tether “pre-salinomycin” during oxidative cyclization. By inactivating salC the researchers have demonstrated that salinomycin biosynthesis proceeds via a diene intermediate.

Life He was born to Samuel Bosanquet, the governor of the Bank of England, and his wife Eleanor, and was educated at Eton College before being accepted into Christ Church, Oxford. He gained his BA on 9 June 1795 and his MA on 20 March 1800. He became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 22 January 1794 and was called to the bar on 9 May 1800, joining the home circuit. He also attended the Essex sessions, of which his father was chairman. Before his call he had, with Christopher Puller, started the Reports of Cases argued and determined in the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer Chamber, and in the House of Lords. Of these reports there are two series, the first in three volumes from 1790 to 1804, and the second in two volumes from 1804 to 1807. Owing to family influence his career at the bar was soon a successful one. He became general counsel to the East India Company in 1814, and the Bank of England in 1819. He was made a Serjeant-at-Law on 22 November 1814, and from that time came prominently before the public in the numerous bank prosecutions which he conducted with great discretion for thirteen years. He turned down the position of Chief Justice of Bengal in 1824 and was made a King's Serjeant in 1827. On 16 May 1828 he was nominated one of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the practice of the common law courts. Over this commission he presided for three years. After the retirement of James Burrough he became Third Justice of the Court of Common Pleas on 1 February 1830, and was knighted the next day. He became a member of the Privy Council on 4 September 1833, and sat on the Judicial Committee regularly until 1840. Upon the resignation of John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst, Bosanquet in conjunction with Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham, the master of the rolls, and Sir Lancelot Shadwell, the vice-chancellor, was appointed a lord commissioner of the great seal. This commission lasted from 23 April 1835 to 16 Jan. 1836, when Pepys was made lord chancellor. He retired from the Common Pleas in 1842 due to ill-health, and died on 25 September 1847 at Firs, Hampstead Heath. He was buried at Llantillio-Crossenny, Monmouthshire.

He was one of the top reporters for The New York Times, city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle and longtime president of the New York Press Club. One of the most colorful reporters of the era, he was a popular lecturer and discussed journalism and his life from 1886 until shortly before his death. During the American Civil War, he and fellow reporter Francis A. Mallison were responsible in creating a forgery falsely declaring another conscription order in New York City by President Abraham Lincoln. This document was published in both the New York World and the Journal of Commerce and, less than a year after the New York Draft Riots, a minor riot ensured when a mob gathered outside Journal of Commerce. Howard was eventually arrested for what became known as \\"Howard's Proclamation\\" or the \\"Great Civil War Gold Hoax\\" and held as a prisoner of war at Fort Lafayette. Biography =Early life and journalism career= Joseph Howard Jr. was born in Brooklyn, New York on June 3, 1833. His family emigrated from England to Salem, Massachusetts in 1700 and remained there for generations before his grandfather Joseph Howard and father John Tasker Howard, both prominent religious leaders, moved to New York City in 1820.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography. Vol. XV. New York: James T. White & Company, 1895. (pg. 213-214) His father was one of the founders of Plymouth Church and responsible for bringing Henry Ward Beecher to its ministry. Joseph Howard was educated at Farmington, Connecticut and graduated from the Troy Polytechnic Institute in 1857.Heidler, Jeanne T. and David J. Coles, ed. Encyclopedia Of The American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History. W. W. Norton & Company, 2002. (pg. 1,007-1,008) He also married Anna S. Gregg, daughter of noted homeopathist Dr. Samuel Gregg, with whom he would have four daughters. Although he had intended to become a civil engineer, he was drawn into the field of journalism by what he called \\"a sense of adventure\\". Shortly after returning from a pleasure trip in California in February 1860, he visited Lynn, Massachusetts to witness a shoemakers strike \\"to see the fun\\". According to the popular story, Howard entered a local hotel and saw the name of a reporter from the New York Herald in the registry. He then signed his name in a similar fashion claiming to be a reporter from the New York Times. That night, he sent a report on the strike to The Times which so impressed the editors that Henry J. Raymond personally telegraphed Howard to offer him a full-time position on the paper.\\"Dies In 75th Year'; Journalist and Lecturer Began His Career as a Reporter for The Times, Was A Prisoner Of War; Lectured on \\"Cranks\\" and \\"People I Have Met \\"  Was Long President of the New York Press Club\\". _New York Times._ 1 Apr 1908 Howard stayed in Lynn covering the strike for the next five weeks and, for several years afterwards, became a leading journalist for The Times. He came to national attention for a series of articles he published while traveling with the Prince of Wales during his tour of the United States and Canada. His reports provided detailed descriptions of the reception given to the Prince and his royal escort as they visited several major cities, all of these letters signed \\"Howard\\". He extensively covered the United States presidential election of 1860 and, the following year, he wrote a false story claiming that Abraham Lincoln had traveled through Baltimore disguised in \\"a Scotch cap and long military cloak\\" while on his way to Washington, D.C. for his official inauguration Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, became a war correspondent and was present at the battles of Bull Run and Ball's Bluff. He also played a series of practical jokes such as holding open the paper's lines to telegraph the genealogy of Jesus and, in September 1862, he violated an order prohibiting journalists from attending the funeral of Brigadier General Philip Kearny by sneaking in dressed in clerical robes. This incident caused his editors to remove him as a regular columnist and he was forced to become a freelance reporter. He did continue to remain with The Times on and off for another eight years and was also a regular contributor to The Independent, The Atlantic Monthly, The Leader, Noah's Sunday Times and other newspapers. Near the end of the war, he was also briefly the city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle and the New York Sunday Mercury. =The Great Civil War Gold Hoax= On May 18, 1864, a government proclamation was published in the New York World and the Journal of Commerce which claimed that President Abraham Lincoln had ordered the conscription of an additional 400,000 men into the Union Army due to \\"the situation in Virginia, the disaster at Red River, the delay at Charleston, and the general state of the country\\". With Confederate General Robert E. Lee on the run from General Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia, this news came as a shock to New Yorkers who believed the war was nearing its end. Predictably, the New York Stock Exchange plummeted while the value of gold immediately began to rise. After less than a year following the New York Draft Riots, it was feared that another riot might result from the story. That same morning, a crowd began to gather outside of the office of the Journal of Commerce on the corner of Wall and Water Streets. Many of these were merchants suspicious of the story and finally General George B. McClellan arrived at the office to investigate the matter. The editors, concerned of a likely confrontation with the mob, insisted the proclamation was real and showed a dispatch from Associated Press which they had received earlier that morning. However, shortly after 11:00 a.m., the Associated Press issued a public statement denying they had such a dispatch. An hour and a half later, a telegram was received from the US State Department in Washington in which Secretary of State William H. Seward declared the proclamation \\"an absolute forgery\\". It was soon discovered that the document was a hoax however the New York financial district, specifically the stock exchange, had suffered greatly in the meantime. President Lincoln also responded by closing down a number of newspapers and arresting the owners resulting in what would be one of the biggest controversies of his presidency. Two days after the story was published, detectives arrested Brooklyn Eagle reporter Francis A. Mallison who quickly confessed to his involvement in the hoax and implicated his editor as having organized the deception. Howard was arrested at his Brooklyn home and later made a full confession. Having an intimate knowledge of the newspaper industry, he knew that the price of gold would skyrocket if word got out of a delay in the war effort. He invested heavily in gold and, when he and Mallison used various couriers to plant the false information in the press the following morning, it was a simple matter for him to sell his shares once the price had risen enough for him to make a huge profit. Howard was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Lafayette for fourteen weeks, serving less than three months of his sentence, before being pardoned by Lincoln on August 22, 1864. The president was supposedly moved by Henry Ward Beecher, a personal friend of Howard's father, who spoke on his behalf claiming that Howard Jr. was guilty only of \\"the hope of making some money\\". Lincoln also appointed Howard official military recorder for the Eastern Department until the end of the war. During his time there, he was present at the trial and execution of Confederate spies John Yates Beall and Robert Cobb Kennedy. Ironically, Lincoln did in fact issue a call for 500,000 men two months later and may have been a factor in Lincoln's lenient treatment of Howard. =Later years= After his release, Howard continued to work for The Times until August 1868 when he became managing editor for \\"Brick\\" Pomeroy's The Democrat. On January 1, 1869, he took control of the New York Star and remained on as editor, publisher and subsequently chief proprietor until the spring of 1875. After a year with the New York Sun, he became a political writer for the New York Herald and received national attention for his accurate predictions during the Blaine campaign in 1880. He officially retired from journalism that same year but continued to send editorials and letters from time to time, popularly known as \\"Howard's Column\\", which appeared in newspapers throughout the Northeastern United States including the New York Press, the New York Recorder and the Boston Globe. Among the social and political events he reported included the trial and execution of presidential assassin Charles J. Guiteau, the Red River Rebellion led by Louis Riel, the presidential campaigns and inaugurations of James A. Garfield and Grover Cleveland, the death and funeral of Ulysses S. Grant and the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. He also compiled a large collection of letters and telegrams sent by various influential members of the Republican Party to Stephen W. Dorsey and provided digests for the memoirs of Grant and Beecher in his column, which were reprinted throughout the world, and regularly corresponded with the Boston Globe, the Chicago News and the United Press. He later reported the trial and execution of the Chicago anarchists for the New York World. He was one of the founding members of the New York Press Club, serving as its president four times, and a member of various others including the Electric Club, the Tenderloin Club, the Philadelphia Journalists, the Brockton Press Club and the Boston Press Club. He was also president of the International League of Press Clubs. In 1886, he delivered a speech entitled \\"Remembrances of Journalism\\" to raise money for the New York Press Club burial fund which received $4,500. He left the staff of The Herald shortly after and began lecturing later that year, his most memorable addresses being \\"Journalism\\", \\"Cranks\\" and \\"People I Have Met\\". Howard was in poor health during the last year and a half of his life and died of kidney failure on the evening of March 31, 1908. Howard is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Living at the family apartments at The Nevada, his four daughters and other relatives were in attendance at the time of his death.

The molecule is similar to urea but is not hydrolyzable by urease; it thus disrupts the bacteria's metabolism through competitive inhibition. It is also a trypanocidal agent. When administered orally, it is metabolized to salicylamide, which exerts analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Salicylhydroxamic acid is also a common ligand utilized in the synthesis of metallacrowns. In plants, some fungi and some protists with the alternative oxidase (AOX) enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain system, salicylhdroxamic acid acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme, blocking the largely uninhibited flow of electrons through AOX. AOX acts as a \\"short circuit\\" of the normal electron chain, dissipating electrons with a much- decreased translocation of protons, and therefore diminished production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. When AOX is blocked by SHAM, electrons are forced through the cytochrome pathway and through complex IV, allowing observation of the operation of the cytochrome pathway without AOX activity. The AOX pathway is found to be the exclusive electron transport pathway in Trypanosoma brucei, the organism that causes African Sleeping Sickness, meaning that SHAM completely shuts down oxygen consumption by this organism.

He was the first to invest in land development in Long Island and, through his efforts, was partly responsible for transforming the southern coastline, then known as the Great South Bay, as a popular summer resort for many prominent New York and Brooklyn families throughout the mid-to late 19th century. His appointment as street commissioner of New York City by Governor John King in 1857, which was instead turned over to Charles Devlin by Mayor Fernando Wood, resulted in the Police Riot of 1857. Biography Born in 1822, Daniel Conover became involved in local New York politics as a young man. He soon became a well-known political activist, being a member of several prominent clubs, and was involved in both municipal and national elections. He was also an outspoken supporter of the New York City Volunteer Fire Department and was closely associated with department for decades. In 1853, he was the foreman of Amity Hose which was reportedly \\"a company not only noted for its elegant carriage, but for the character and prominence of its members in the community\\". He was a member of the Common Council and, through his influence, he successfully introduced the resolution to purchase the fire department's first steam engine. He was also a presidential elector for John C. Frémont during the United States presidential election of 1856.\\"Obituary Record. Daniel Denice Conover\\". _New York Times._ 16 Aug 1896 In 1857, he was appointed street commissioner by Governor John King. On the day he was to assume his office however, Conover was informed that Mayor Fernando Wood had instead given the position to Charles Devlin and had Conover thrown out of the building by Municipal police. Conover immediately obtained two arrest warrants for Mayor Wood, one charging him with inciting a riot and another for assault, and returned to New York City Hall with 50 Metropolitan officers. The resulting confrontation between the Municipal and Metropolitan police resulted in the Police Riot of 1857.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld.

(pg. 113) Following this incident, Conover became a prominent industrialist especially in New York's growing street railway systems. He was one of the projectors for the Boulevard Line, the granting of a charter for which precipitated a contest in the Board of Aldermen, as well as the Thirty-Fourth Street line. He later became president of the Fulton Street, Wall Street & Cortland Street Ferries Railroad Company and the Twenty-Eighth & Twenty-Ninth Street Railroad Company. Settling in Bay Ridge, New York during his later years, Conover was responsible for developing real estate in the area surrounding Bay Ridge and Islip, New York. He first visited Bay Ridge in 1856 when the Olympic Club, of which he was a member, relocated there. He began buying up cheap undeveloped property, among these a sizable property on Saxton Avenue where he built a Victorian style cottage for his wife and children, and constructed homes which rented out for $100 to $1,000 a month. These cottages were based along Saxton Avenue, Awixa Avenue and Main Street and, although considered a highly risky investment, the area eventually became popular vacation spot for many prominent New York and Brooklyn families during the mid- to late 19th century. He also expended his projects to further develop the area and attract affluent residents. Among these included the dredging of nearby creeks allowing the navigation of larger boats. Using a steam shovel, he was able to deepen and widen the channels of Awixa Creek, Champlin’s Creek and Orowoc Creek. The east end of Awixa Creek was cut off, dredged from its mouth northward toward South Country Road, and a freshwater lake was built. A road which would have connected Awixa Avenue to Saxton Avenue over the lake was also planned but never completed. Other changes included the channel of Champlin’s Creek being widened 90 feet while Orowoc Creek was dredged and the surrounding area filled for additional land. Conover's experience in public transportation aided him in improving roads and highways in Long Island which were described as \\"of full width, flat surfaces, and composed of clam shells and in equal parts\\" that would \\"stand all seasons\\". While his designs were superior over the existing dirt roads, little was done to improve general road conditions despite complaints from local residents. One of his roads, the South Country Road, was one of the earliest modern public highways in Long Island and eventually became Moffitt Boulevard, located north of the Long Island Rail Road line. Islip in particular benefited greatly from Conover's land development and encouraged others to invest in the area as well. One of Conover's properties, Orowoc Pond, held a fishing expedition in 1899 which hosted former president Grover Cleveland. Conover remained in Bay Ridge until his death on August 15, 1896, and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. His historic Saxton Avenue residence was bought from the Conover family by Franklyn and Edna Hutton in 1912, and then by Philip B. Weld in 1921 and finally H. Cecil Sharp in 1929. Sharp purchased additional property surrounding the home during the next few years and, in 1933, the house was removed in order for Sharp to build a new house. The barn and windmill however, remain on the property up to the present day. References Further reading *Costello, Augustine E.

Painting by Antoine Pesne, about 1733. Prussian virtues () refers to the virtues associated with the historical Kingdom of Prussia, especially its militarism and the ethical code of the Prussian army, but also bourgeois values as influenced by Calvinism in particular. It has also significantly influenced wider German culture, such as the contemporary German stereotypes of efficiency, austerity and discipline. Development These virtues, while traced back to the Teutonic knights, were named by King Frederick William I of Prussia, the \\"soldierking\\" and frugal \\"bourgeois\\" reformer of Prussian administration, as well as from his son, Frederick the Great. The father had taken over an over-indebted public budget and saw himself as a moral role model, while the son saw himself as an exemplar of reason for the religiously, ethnically, and linguistically diverse Prussian state.Christian Graf v. Krockow: \\"Die Pflicht und das Glück\\" (speech on 17 August 1991 in the Neues Palais, Potsdam) in: Hans Bentzien: Die Heimkehr der Preußenkönige, 1. edition, Berlin 1991. The extended Prussian territory was home to Protestant, Catholic and Jewish subjects, of Germans, Poles, Sorbs and Kashubians. Frederick William I considered himself to be a role model, while his enlightened son relied on reason and tolerance to rule his multifaceted state. Prussia developed a highly advanced administration and legal system, as well as a loyal officer corps and a kind of common-sense patriotism gathering the subjects behind the Hohenzollern ruler. The Prussian \\"era of reform\\", from the military defeat by Napoleon I at the Battles of Jena and Auerstedt, until the Congress of Vienna in 1815, was also an important influence. These included reform of community boundaries, the army, schools, universities, and taxes, as well as the enfranchisement of Jews.Hans-Joachim Schoeps: chapter \\"Preußische Tugenden\\" in Preußen – Bilder und Zeugnisse (most recently posthumously in Preußen – Geschichte eines Staates, Frankfurt a.

The Prussian virtues may be summarized by the opening lines of the poem \\"\\" (\\"The Old Farmer to His Son\\") by Ludwig Christoph Heinrich Hölty (1748–1776). The text reads as follows: \\"\\" Translation: \\"Practice always fidelity and honesty / Until your cool grave; / And stray not the width of one finger/ From the ways of the Lord.\\"\\"\\", zeno.org The poem was set to music by Mozart to a melody adapted from the aria \\"\\" from his 1791 opera The Magic Flute. It was played daily by the carillon of the Potsdam Garrison Church\\"\\" where Frederick the Great was initially buried. Post-WWII views Since the defeat in World War II and the denazification campaign, historical German militarism has become anathema in German culture, focused on collective responsibility and atonement. At the same time, the related non-military, bourgeois virtues of efficiency, discipline and work morals remain in high standing. This has led to the concept of \\"Prussian virtues\\" being regarded with mixed feelings in modern-day Germany. Amongst the German student protests of 1968, militarist virtues were rejected as prerequisite for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. The term Kadavergehorsam for \\"blind obedience\\", originally a slur directed against Jesuits during the 1870s Kulturkampf, came to be used as a derogatory staple of \\"Prussian\\" military ethos. Similarly, the term Nibelungentreue (\\"Nibelung loyalty\\"), which in the German Empire had been used in a positive sense for the military virtue of absolute loyalty, came to be used derogatorily in reference to fanatical loyalty characteristic of fascism. In 1982, amid the controversy surrounding the NATO Double-Track Decision, in response to Social Democratic Party of Germany Chancellor of Germany Helmut Schmidt's call for a return to such virtues, Saarbrücken's SPD mayor Oskar Lafontaine commented that these were \\"perfectly suited to run a concentration camp\\". In 2006, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg Matthias Platzeck called for a return to Prussian virtues, citing \\"good basic virtues, such as honesty, reliability, and diligence\\".Rhodes, R. (2004.)

The organization’s founding in 1909 was endorsed by Theodore Roosevelt and spearheaded by Secretary of State Elihu Root and eminent art patrons and artists of the day. The AFA’s mission is to enrich the public’s experience and understanding of the visual arts, and this is accomplished through its exhibitions, catalogues, and public programs. To date, the AFA has organized or circulated approximately 3,000 exhibitions that have been viewed by more than 10 million people in museums in every state, as well as in Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. History =Early history and publications= The AFA was founded on May 12, 1909. At a meeting on May 11, 1909, convened by the National Academy of Art’s, Board of Regents—among whom were President William Howard Taft, former president Theodore Roosevelt, Cecilia Beaux, Robert Woods Bliss, William Merritt Chase, Robert W. de Forest, Homer Saint-Gaudens, Charles L. Hutchinson, Archer M. Huntington, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Leila Mechlin, Andrew W. Mellon, J. Pierpont Morgan, Francis D. Millet, Secretary of State Elihu Root, and Henry Walters, among others— Elihu Root called for the formation of an agency that would send “exhibitions of original works of art on tour to the hinterlands of the United States.” With the unanimous endorsement of Root’s motion by representatives from more than eighty American art institutions—among them, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the American Academy in Rome—the AFA was founded on May 12, 1909. The organization’s founders further agreed to hold annual meetings and devote themselves to promoting the visual arts as a vital component of the nation’s cultural life. Hutchinson, who at the time was the President of the Art Institute of Chicago, was elected the organization's first president. When Root proposed the creation of the AFA in 1909, the nation’s artistic wealth was largely concentrated in eastern cities and inaccessible to most citizens. The AFA and its traveling exhibitions were envisioned as a means of “bringing the museum to the people.” During its inaugural year, the AFA organized three traveling exhibitions, the first of which was Thirty-Eight Paintings by Prominent American Artists, and launched Art and Progress magazine (later renamed Magazine of Art), an innovative vehicle for art scholarship that continued to be published until 1953. The exhibition was viewed by more than 5,600 people at the library before traveling to New Orleans, St. Paul, and New Ulm, Minnesota.The AFA also published the first edition of Who's Who in American Art (1935), as well as the American Art Annual (later known as the American Art Directory). While it no longer publishes these directories and journals, the AFA retains a commitment to publishing new art historical research through the catalogues it produces in conjunction with its exhibitions. =Lobbying efforts= In 1910, the AFA promoted the creation of a National Commission of Fine Arts, which was subsequently established by an act of congress to advise the government on matters of art and design as they pertain to the nation’s capital. In 1913, the AFA launched a successful lobbying effort to remove tariffs on art entering the United States and a 1916 session with the Interstate Commerce Commission to protest prohibitively high interstate taxes on traveling art. In 1920, the AFA was instrumental in organizing a lobbying campaign for the “development of a national gallery of art on a basis worthy of our great nation,” a goal eventually realized with the founding of the National Gallery of Art in 1941. Other government-tied AFA initiatives include arranging the first American representation in the Venice Biennale in 1924 and thereafter until the 1970s. =Public programs= The AFA’s history includes a series of programs designed to facilitate greater access and appreciation of the visual arts, among them, the first nationally broadcast radio programs about art (1930s–1940s); the Picture of the Month Program (1954), offering original paintings at low rental fees to small art and educational organizations; the Museum Donor Program (1960s), distributing allowances to regional museums to purchase contemporary American art; The Art of Seeing (1965), a landmark series of educational films on visual perception; The Curriculum in Visual Education (1966), a collection of films and instructional materials designed to heighten the aesthetic awareness of children; the Rent-an-Artist Program (renamed the Visitor Artist Program) (1970s), placing artists in residency at museums around the country; A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema (1976), the first curatorially selected international traveling film program; and ART ACCESS I and II (1989–98), a fee-subsidy program sponsored by the Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund making AFA exhibitions of American art more affordable for museums. In 1909, the AFA created the Package Library, which offered newspaper and magazine clippings on a variety of art subjects for loan to AFA members. Although intended primarily for use in communities with limited library facilities, the files were often in demand by members in larger cities as well. By 1942, the library included more than 1,000 envelopes covering topics from contemporary American painting to industrial art. In 1934, in collaboration with the General Federation of Women's Clubs and with support from the Carnegie Corporation, the AFA launched the first nationally broadcast radio series on art, \\"Art in America 1600–1865,\\" with René d'Harnoncourt as program director. The first subject was “America After the Civil War: Whistler and Winslow Homer—Expatriate and Stay- at-Home.” Discontinued during World War II, the radio program was reestablished in the 1940s with the title “Living Art.” In 1994, the AFA inaugurated the Directors Forum, a two-and-a-half-day annual conference for museum directors that featured panel discussions with some of the most distinguished professionals in the art world. Beginning in 2005, the Directors Forum is now an annual program of the independent Art Museum Partnership. Building upon the success of that program, the AFA began, in 2001, a similar conference for art museum curators. The Curators Forum later evolved into the independent Association of Art Museum Curators in 2001. In 2003, the AFA instituted ArtTalks, a lecture series featuring prominent artists and other influential figures of the art world, among them, artists Janine Antoni, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, John Currin, Shirin Neshat, and Do-Ho Suh; New York Times critic Roberta Smith; New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik; and Sotheby's Worldwide Head of Contemporary Art Tobias Meyer. Most recently, the AFA launched ArtViews, a series of panel discussions that address critical issues in the museum field. Its first edition held in 2011 was titled \\"Shifting Challenges in the Protection of Archaeological Heritage\\" and was organized in conjunction with the Institute of Fine Arts and the Association of Art Museum Directors. More recent subjects have included: \\"Art Museum Funding at the Crossroads\\" (2012), \\"Art Museum Blockbusters: Myths, Facts, and their Future (2013), \\"Digital Space/Physical Space, Mapping the 21st Century Museum\\" (2015), \\"The Future of Art Museum Leadership\\" (2016), and \\"Museums Now: Relevance and Representation\\" (2017). =Film and video= Through the development of touring film and video exhibitions, publications, and an eventual collection of 139 documentaries on the arts and avant-garde films and videos, the AFA developed a groundbreaking film and video program that focused on the work of independent contemporary media artists in this country and abroad. Released beginning in 1949, the organization’s publications on the subject include the pamphlet Guide to Films on Art (1949); Films on Art (1952), a comprehensive guide that listed and reviewed more than 450 films on art subjects; New American Filmmakers (1971), a catalogue of independent films produced in cooperation with the Whitney Museum; A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema (1976); Films on Art: A Source Book (1977), the second edition of the 1952 volume Films on Art; and Before Hollywood: Turn-of-the- Century Film from American Archives (1987). In 1959, the AFA co-sponsored the first art film festival in the U.S.—Films on Art Festival, in Woodstock, New York, with the Woodstock Artists Association, the College Art Association, Hunter College, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1969, the AFA established Circulating Films on Art, thus becoming the first organization of its kind to circulate such films for rent. In 1971, the AFA began circulating 200 films from the Whitney’s New American Filmmakers series, expanding the collaboration in 1979 with the circulation of films from the Whitney Biennial and again in 1983 with the addition of video to the Biennial. In 1976, the AFA organized the first curatorially selected international traveling film exhibition, A History of the American Avant-Garde Cinema. In addition to its traveling video selections from the Whitney, in 1983, the AFA began organizing independent traveling video exhibitions, the first of which included American Documentary Video: Subject to Change; New Video: Japan; and Revisiting Romance: New Feminist Video. In 1993, the AFA transferred its collection of prize-winning American and European films and videotapes to the Museum of Modern Art’s Circulating Film and Video program, and in 1996, upon the dissolution of its Media Arts Department, transferred its inventory of film and video exhibitions to the Film and Video Department of the Museum of Modern Art. =Offices and mergers= After initial meetings in Francis Millet’s studio in Washington, D.C., in 1909 the AFA moved its headquarters into the Octagon Building at 1741 New York Avenue, N.W., renting space from the American Institute of Architects. The National League of Handicraft Societies merged with the AFA in 1912, and constituent societies were made AFA members. In 1913, the AFA opened its first New York office in the Fine Arts Building at 215 West 57th Street. The office later moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and then to 40 East 49th Street. Beginning in 1952, the AFA relocated its headquarters, moving from Washington, D.C. to New York, renting offices at 1083 Fifth Avenue. In 1987, the AFA’s merger with the Art Museum Association of America (AMAA) brought together the two oldest nonprofit art museum organizations in America, creating a larger national organization that could offer a comprehensive set of services without duplication. Retaining the name American Federation of Arts, the new organization maintained offices in both New York and San Francisco, and former AMAA Director Myrna Smoot became director. The San Francisco office was dedicated to the AFA’s Museum Services Department. Also based in the West Coast was the AFA’s administration of the Getty’s Museum Management Institution (MMI), a training program for museum directors held at Berkeley. Now known as the Getty Leadership Institute, it is a program of the Getty Trust and operates out of Claremont Graduate University. In 1990, the AFA closed its West Coast office and moved the Museum Services Department to its New York headquarters. In 2007, the AFA sold its townhouse at 41 East 65th Street and moved to its current location at 305 East 47th Street. =Notable members= * Una B.

He got his basic education from his father who taught him and took personal interest in the education and upbringing of his son. He did his matriculation from Meerut, 'Faiz-e-Aam' high school in mid 1940s. He got his basic and advance religious studies in 'Mansabia' a center of excellence for shi'a community of Meerut. He learned and grasped different styles and skills of reciting Soaz, Marsiya and Noha from his maternal grandfather Syed Mohammad Jan who was also a famous and well-known Soazkhawan of his era. Work, contribution and legacy Syed Ali Ausat Zaidi had started reciting soaz, salam and marsiya quite early in his life with his maternal grandfather when he was just 10 years old though he perfected his art under supervision of his maternal grandfather and afterward he started reciting soaz, salam and marsiya independently in majalis at Meerut.

This was the first time he recited marsiya independently in a majlis. His effort was very fruitful. Allama Rasheed Turabi admired his style of delivering Salam O Marsiya so much that he invited him for Soazkhawani at Majlis-e-Soazkhawani, 19th Safar at Azakhana-e-Zehra. This Majlis-e- Soazkhawani was started and organised by Allama Rasheed Turabi Sahib himself. In this majlis, leading Soazkhawans gifted Hadiya's of there Soaz O Salam to Imam Hussain (A.S). Syed Ali Ausat Zaidi as offered by Turabi Sahab attended this majlis and recited a Salam of 'Sajjad Razmi' Sahab which was liked by audience. Allama Rasheed Turabi Sahab encouraged Syed Ali Ausat Zaidi and said: “Ausat Mian, Iss Saal ki Majlis Tu Tum Nay Loot Li” In Urdu, اوسط مياں ، ا س سال کي مجلس تو تم نے لوٹ لي In this way Ali Ausat Sahab, started being recognised and known as a Soazkhawan in Karachi.

CBBC is usually issued by third parties, mostly investment banks, but neither by stock exchanges nor by asset owners. It was first introduced in Europe and Australia in 2001, and it is now popular in United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Hong Kong. CBBC is actively traded among investors in Europe and Hong Kong, which is partially due to the fact that it can cater to individual investors' behavioral biases (like lottery preferences). Can financial innovation succeed by catering to behavioral preferences? Evidence from a callable options market, Journal of Financial Economics, 128(1): 38-65, April 2018. (by Xindan Li, Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, Xuewei Yang) https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.01.010 Principle CBBC has two types of contracts, callable bull contract and callable bear contract, which are always issued in the money. By investing in a callable bull contract, investors are bullish on the prospect of the underlying asset and intend to capture its potential price appreciation. Conversely, investors buying a callable bear contract are bearish on the prospect of the underlying asset and try to make a profit in a falling market. CBBC is typically issued at a price that represents the difference between the spot price of the underlying asset and the strike price of the CBBCs, plus a small premium (which is usually the funding cost). The strike price can be equal to or lower (bull)/higher (bear) than the call price. The call price is also referred to as \\"stop loss\\", \\"trigger point\\", \\"knockout point\\" or \\"barrier\\" by different traders. However, CBBC will expire at a predefined date or will be called immediately by the issuers when the price of the underlying asset reaches a call price before expiry.

Death  Evžen Plocek, was a toolmaker by trade, but by 1968 had become deputy director of the car-parts company Motorpal and a candidate to the extraordinary meeting of the Czech Communist Party (see Prague Spring). On Good Friday, 4 April 1969, several months after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Plocek set himself on fire in Main Square (now called Masarykovo nam.) in Jihlava, Czechoslovakia, in protest at what he saw as Soviet aggression. His was the fourth suicide by self-immolation after an accountant, Ryszard Siwiec, set himself on fire in Warsaw on 8 September 1968 dying four days later in hospital, and two Czech students, Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc, who burned themselves to death in Prague on 16 January 1969, and 25 February 1969, respectively.

Evžen Plocek was taken to the Jihlava hospital, where he died on 9 April. Only on that day did the local media announce that \\"somebody immolated himself and is in a critical condition\\".

Blunt force to the liver can be excruciatingly painful, and an especially effective shot will incapacitate a person at once. Thus, in combat sports, liver shots often result in technical knockouts (TKOs). A liver punch is usually made with the left hand, or the left hook in infighting, or the regular short body hook, in a short and quick manner. The drive is usually made under and to the front of the ninth and tenth ribs upward to the base of the shoulder blade toward the spine. The punch shocks the liver, the largest gland organ, and a center of blood circulation, and causes the victim to lose focus and drive, and can cause a breathless feeling in the victim. It is usually delivered when feinting an opponent to lead with his right, which leaves the body exposed; the attacker then steps in and delivers a short, stiff uppercut, over the liver, which will likely leave the average man incapacitated. Most of the time, however, a liver punch is unintentional. It begins as a left hook to the body, but as the defending boxer puts his elbow down and begins to roll with the punch, the back is exposed. Thus, the attacking boxer is frequently offered either the arm or the back of the ribs, the latter of which he will usually take instead. Front kicks and spinning back kicks, which are commonly associated with karate and taekwondo, can also target the liver to great effect.  Examples  Notable examples of liver shots in combat sport include: * Bas Rutten repeatedly knocked down Jason DeLucia with liver punches during their 1996 Pancrase fight, rupturing DeLucia's liver and earning a TKO victory.The 10 Best Signature Moves in MMA Bas Rutten's liver shot is #1. * Micky Ward knocked down Arturo Gatti with a liver punch in May 2002. * Mirko Filipović knocked down Heath Herring with his signature left roundhouse kick to the liver in June 2003. * Bernard Hopkins knocked Oscar De La Hoya out with a liver shot in 2004. * Amir Khan knocked Marcos Maidana down in the first round of their fight with a liver shot in 2010. * Alistair Overeem knocked down Brock Lesnar with a liver kick at UFC 141, December 2011. * Gennady Golovkin knocked Matthew Macklin out with a liver shot in June 2013. * Daniel Geale sent Darren Barker to the canvas in the sixth round of their fight with a liver shot in 2013. * Ronda Rousey knocked Sara McMann down with a knee to the liver at UFC 170, February 2014. * Lyoto Machida knocked down C.B.

Life  Wolf Schneider grew up in Berlin. Having passed his Abitur he served with the German Luftwaffe until the end of the war. His post-war career began as a translator for the US Army, in 1947 he joined the Munich-based Neue Zeitung, a newspaper of the US military government. It was here that he received journalistic training and later worked as an editor. In the early 1950s Schneider was a correspondent for the news agency AP; in later years he was in charge of the news team and correspondent in Washington for the Süddeutsche Zeitung. In 1966 Schneider joined the Stern magazine, where he worked as editor in chief and from 1969 as manager of the publishing house. German media tycoon Axel Springer hired Schneider in 1971 to design the news magazine Dialog aimed at challenging Spiegel's dominant position in the German market. The project ended in failure, however, and Schneider was appointed editor in chief of Springer's conservative daily Die Welt, based in Hamburg. A commentary on the Chilean dictator Pinochet deemed too critical by Springer cost Schneider his job within a year of his appointment. Schneider remained at Springer as editor in chief without portfolio. In 1979 he was appointed first director of the newly founded Hamburg school of journalism, now called Henri- Nannen-Schule). He was to hold this position until 1995. He taught more than 300 pupils, many of whom are now in leading positions. He also became widely known during this time as the godfather of concise German prose. In the 1980s and early 90s he also presented the NDR talkshow. Schneider lives in Starnberg.  Language critic  Since 1995 Wolf Schneider has been a vigorous lecturer on the German language and has been giving seminars for press officers and young journalists. He is a prolific writer and has produced 28 best-selling nonfiction books, among them staple works on good German style (e.g. „German for life. What school forgot to teach“). His latest works are „Speak German“ – a defence of the German language in the face of Anglicisms and „Man: A career“ which tells the story of Man's rise to mastery of the Earth and plots our uncertain future. His ideal is a concise written style, which avoids the typically German pitfalls of rambling sentences, separated verbs and complex constructions. Schneider is a critic of orthography reform and has founded with others the pressure group „living German“. He has received several prizes and holds a chair as honorary professor in Salzburg.

In the past, Slaggyford had a higher population than Alston, with its own market square. However, as lead mining increased around Alston, many residents moved to become miners and the population of Slaggyford declined. It is set in South Tyne valley (often called the Tyne Gap). Hadrian's Wall lies to the north of the Tyne Gap. The South Tyne Valley falls within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), the second largest of the 40 AONBs in England and Wales. Slaggyford takes its name from the Old English for ‘muddy, dirty ford’, which may originate from quickly moving river water stirring up the river bed at the bottom of a short steep hill, as the river drops from to from Alston to Slaggyford. The Pennine Way runs through the village on its way northwards from Alston to Greenhead. The Maiden Way Roman road passes through Slaggyford, with the A689 road following the line of the Roman road for a few hundred yards on the way south out of the village.Ordnance Survey Explorer OL43 Map, Hadrian's Wall  Governance  Slaggyford is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. Guy Opperman of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament. Up until Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North East England constituency. For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority, with Slaggyford lying in the Tynedale Division. Prior to the 2009 structural changes to local government in England it was part of Tynedale Council.  Transport  Slaggyford was served by a railway station on the Alston Line from Haltwhistle to Alston. The line opened in 1852 and closed in 1976. Since 1983, a 2 foot (0.61 m) narrow gauge railway has been opened on part of the original track bed. It is called the South Tynedale Railway and currently runs for from Alston to the old station at Slaggyford and includes crossing three viaducts up the South Tyne Valley and over the River South Tyne. Construction of the section of track from Lintley to Slaggyford was completed in July 2017, and as of June 2018 regular passenger trains had started to run from the station.

He represented England as a schoolboy. O'Brien, a left-sided midfielder, began his career as a trainee with Everton, turning professional in October 1997. At Everton he had captained the FA Youth Cup winning side in 1998, but his progress was hampered by injury and he was released at the end of the 1998–99 season. He joined Torquay United in August 1999 and later that month, on the opening day of the season, scored on his league debut against Shrewsbury Town at Gay Meadow. After a first season in and out of the starting line-up, but with some notable moments, including as a goal from a 30-yard free kick at Loftus Road in the FA Cup third round tie against Queens Park Rangers in December 1999, O'Brien fell out of favour with manager Wes Saunders. He was loaned to Conference side Southport in January 2001, returning in March with Torquay struggling at the foot of the Football League. With Saunders sacked, O'Brien returned to the first team squad under new manager Colin Lee, playing four times as a substitute before the end of the season. The last of these games, on the final day of the season, saw O'Brien come on early in the first half for Jason Rees as Torquay won 3–2 away to Barnet to avoid relegation and send Barnet down instead. Lee left at the end of the season and was replaced by Roy McFarland. O'Brien was one of a number of players on short-term contracts, giving McFarland a chance to assess the squad. He appeared as a late substitute for Tony Bedeau on 11 August 2001, as Torquay lost 1–0 away to Bristol Rovers, but was released at the end of that month. He joined Droylsden in September 2001, moving to Chester City the following month and appearing in their Conference side. He was released by Chester at the end of the 2002–03 season, having not played in their first team that season. He returned to Droylsden in August 2003, playing seven times up to early October. He returned to the Droylden side in October 2005, playing his final game for them that season on 12 December as Droylsden lost at home to Workington. He also became kit man to the Everton youth team, also taking some of the coaching and by April 2008 was one of Everton's Academy coaches.

At a casual glance, this species resembles its widespread relative E. sulphurella, being largely black, with a white band half-way across the thick antennae and yellowish forewing markings. Of these, the band across the midwing is not interrupted however, and the proximal lengthwise mark is a shorter triangle rather than a long streak. After eclosion and some time thereafter, E. oliviella also has a pronounced purplish sheen which is far less conspicuous in E. sulphurella even if freshly eclosed.

His name was synonymous with the musical instrument Veena, and he was and still is known in the Carnatic Music world, simply as Veena Chitti Babu. Early childhood and career Chitti Babu Challapally (surname) was born on 13 October 1936, in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India, to music-loving parents, Ranga Rao Challapally and Sundaramma Challapally, who had initially named him Hanumanlu, when he was born. Chitti Babu was his nickname at home, which came to stay eventually, after his father formally changed it to be so. He was a child prodigy who started playing Veena at the age of 5. He had a providential beginning, when at that early age, he corrected his father playing the Veena and the stunned father spontaneously decided to get him started on the Veena and nurture the child's inherent prodigious talent. Chitti Babu gave his first performance at the age of 12. He had his earliest basic lessons from Shri. Pandravada Upmakaya and also Shri Eyyuni Appalacharyulu and later was a prime disciple of MahaMahopadhyaya Dr Emani Sankara Sastry. In 1948, they moved to Madras (now Chennai) primarily because they got the opportunity for Chitti Babu to act in a Telugu movie \\"Laila- Majnu\\" as a child artiste who played the role of little Majnu. The movie was produced by Bhanumathi Ramakrishna and starred herself and Akkineni Nageswara Rao in the lead roles, both of whom became thespians eventually. The movie was a hit and he had also starred in a small role in another movie as well. However, Chitti Babu even as a child of 12, was very focused and determined on becoming a performing classical musician, after the movie assignment. He was inspired by the original style of Veena maestro Emani Sankara Sastry and was under his tutelage, learning all the nuances and honing his skills. Film and music Like any upcoming young artiste of that era, it was also a struggle and a difficult thing for him to get the first major breaks as a performing artiste and more so as a teenager. So, he had a significant stint as a key Veena artiste, in film music from 1948–1962, when he worked in the South Indian Film Industry as a recording artiste, playing Veena for numerous background scores in movie soundtracks under the batons of many eminent music directors of the time like Saluri Rajeswara Rao, Pendyala Nageswara Rao, and the duo of Viswanathan-Ramamoorthi among others. A key element in many of the super hit songs of that time period in Telugu and Tamil, was the Veena by Chitti Babu After having established himself as a Carnatic musician, Chitti Babu still had opportunity to associate himself with filmdom for a while. Some of his key works include: – Playing the Veena soundtrack in Director CV Sridhar's classic Tamil movie called Kalai Kovil in 1964. The protagonist of this movie R. Muthuraman was a Veena artiste, and the entire background score for the Veena was played and recorded by Chitti Babu. This movie received wide critical acclaim for its music and storyline and performances by the artistes. – Playing the kriti \\"Raghuvamsa Sudha\\" as the Title Soundtrack for the very famous Telugu classical hit movie called Sampoorna Ramayanam directed by Bapu – He was Music Director for Singeetham Srinivasa Rao's award-winning film Dikkatra Parvathi (1974) – based a story by Rajaji and lyrics by the legendary Kannadasan. A song sung by Vani Jairam – \\"Aagaayam Mazhai Pozhindaal\\" was a popular number in its time. – In 1979, he had also composed music for a Kannada movie called \\"Sri Raghavendra Mahime\\" that was also dubbed into Telugu. However, the burning ambition inside him to continue to establish himself as an independent, freelancing solo concert artiste made him declare at a very young age – \\"Veena is my Mission in Life\\" and caused him to pursue a lifelong career as a performing artiste, a goal from which he never wavered for the rest of his life. His Playing Style or \\"Bani\\" While continuing with the principles of his Guru's pioneering school – the Emani \\"Bani\\" (tradition/style), Chitti Babu, created and evolved a distinctive style and identity, entirely his own. The exquisite tonal quality and versatility that have been his magical hallmarks of his style of playing the Veena, saw him produce sounds as varied as the majestic Vedic Hymns or as delicate as the Cuckoo's voice or even play many western-music based compositions of his own. He was known to reproduce the songs and compositions in an almost vocal like tonal quality on his Veena, and was also known to evoke deeply emotional and appreciative responses from his audiences. His music could impress the connoisseurs and invoke the interest and curiosity of the youngsters as well, that always ensured that his concerts were a big draw in terms of audience. Awards and recognition Throughout his glittering career, he won many accolades regularly from almost all major cultural organizations in India and abroad. Many had also conferred numerous honorary titles on him (as is traditional to honor someone in India) and were presented to him by senior artistes, government officials, and other eminent people of his time, from all walks of life. Some of the more well-known ones are: *Sangeet Natak Akademi award for 1990 – awarded by the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi in New Delhi and presented by Shri R. Venkataraman – the then President of India *Kalaimamani – 1972 – Prestigious Award from Government of Tamil Nadu presented by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Shri Karunanidhi *Asthana Vidwan – Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams *State Artiste – Government of Tamil Nadu – 1981–1987, presented by Shri MG Ramachandran, then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu *Telugu Velugu – Government of Andhra Pradesh, presented by Shri Tanguturi Anjaiah, then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1981 *Tantri Vilas – Government of Madhya Pradesh *Spirit of Excellence Award in 1991–92 presented by the then Vice President of India Shri Shankar Dayal Sharma *Sangeetha Choodamani – Krishna Gana Sabha – 1990 *Sangeetha Kala Nipuna – Mylapore Fine Arts Club – 1995 Chief among those was the title \\"Vainika Shikhamani\\" in 1967 presented by the then Maharajah of Mysore, Shri Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, who on hearing Chitti Babu, in an exclusive performance at his palace, was so impressed by his versatility that, he removed a golden chain that he was personally wearing around his neck at the time, and presented it to Chitti Babu in a spontaneous gesture of appreciation. The chain also happened to have a gem-studded, gold pendant. Chitti Babu cherished this because Wodeyar was known to have been a great connoisseur of arts and music, and was also known as \\"a musician among princes and a prince among musicians\\". Concert tours Chitti Babu was a much sought-after artiste by music lovers, all his life, and had toured extensively in India and the world over including concert tours in USA, Europe, USSR, Bahrain, Muscat, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Japan and Australia. He has represented India in various international music festivals including Donaueschingen Festival in 1971 in what was then West Germany, Festival of India in USSR in 1987 and the Tokyo Summer Festival with the theme \\"Visions of India\\" organized by Arion-Edo Foundation in 1993 in Tokyo, Japan to name a few. He performed to jam packed auditoriums for nearly five decades, transcending many barriers and taking his music and along with it, a part of India's rich cultural heritage across the world.

AHEAD stands for Applied Health, Education, And Development.  History  Africa AHEAD is a UK registered Charity founded in 2013 by Juliet and Anthony Waterkeyn, and a Board of well known UK academics chaired by Prof Sandy Cairncross (OBE). It was started to scale up the work of the Waterkeyn's in many countries in Africa, who since 1994 have been developing and refining a model of community development, known as the 'Applied Health Education and Development' (AHEAD) Approach - a 4 phase process of holistic and integrated development. This is a method of community mobilisation which starts up a grass roots group in each villages known as a Community Health Club. Africa AHEAD grew out of Zimbabwe AHEAD Trust founded by the Waterkeyns in 1999, which remains one of the most innovative NGOs in Zimbabwe, having started over 2,000 CHCs directly reaching over 1 million people in Zimbabwe alone. It has developed the training materials and method for health education to prevent many common diseases which cause 80% of infant deaths - such as diarrhoea, cholera, pneumonia, malaria and malnutrition; as well as many debilitating diseases which affect growth and development such as bilharzia, intestinal helminths (worms), skin and eye diseases.  Approach  The reduction of disease is achieved through shared understanding and common action to prevent these diseases through good hygiene facilities and non risk hygiene behaviour. Consensus for common action is achieved by regular community level meetings, facilitated by a local village health worker, who helps to focus the community's attention on issues of health and hygiene. Over time, the 'common unity' is built, and this functional community then begin to focus on the many ways they can improve their health typically through construction and use of hygienic latrine, hand washing facilities, as well as ensuring a safe environment for children. The 1st stage of the process is a six-month period of weekly dialogue sessions on health issues which affect them and ways to control disease through preventative means. The 2nd stage is to put this knowledge into practice through the construction of local sanitary facilities, and the improvement of kitchen hygiene as well as personal hygiene. In the 3rd year the Community Health Clubs tend to morph into a Food Agriculture and nutrition Club (FAN) which start up nutrition gardens or other farming activities to generate income, and in so doing empower women in particular to be self-sufficient financially. This leads to increased self- confidence and sustainable livelihoods as women run income-generation businesses enable the community to improve its health and hygiene situation, as well as supporting other vulnerable families in the neighbourhood. The 4th and possibly final stage of development is when the village is largely self- sustaining and can competently ensure the survival, growth and proper development of all children, controlling all preventable diseases. At this point people can afford to be more altruistic and reach out to marginalised and vulnerable families within their community such as widows, orphans, child headed families, and those who are infirm, aged, mentally unstable or have terminal diseases. This is also a time of building civic responsibility, becoming politically aware and a full participant in society, ensuring the rights of all are adequately protected. The AHEAD Model is in effect a 'Rights based approach', putting women at the centre of development in a model of community development which uses health promotion as an entrypoint to sustainable development, providing a practical model which can be used by NGOs and government to meet the Sustainable Development Goals at under US$5 per person. To date the AHEAD Approach has only been scaled up nationwide in Rwanda in the Community Based Environmental Health Promotion Programme (CBEHPP) which has reached every one of the 14,767 villages in Rwanda, being instrumental in enabling sanitation coverage to increase to 98% in Rwanda by 2015. The CBEHP Programme was first started in 2010, introduced by Anthony Waterkeyn, working with WSP/World Bank for Ministry of Health. The concept was immediately understood as a means of community building and was endorsed directly by President Kagame himself. By 2015 core trainers, originally trained by Juliet Waterkeyn had succeeded in rolling out the CHC training to 40% of the villages in Rwanda, assisted by 14 implementing partners, such as Water Aid, World Vision, Swiss Aid, SNV and others. In 2016 USAID supported the massive scale up to cover 8 districts which included not only Water and Sanitation but also a nutrition component. Africa AHEAD supported Rusizi District funded by the Gates Foundation in an evaluation of the CHC Approach. In 2014 President Kagame advocated the use of CBEHPP in the Kigali Action Plan which focuses on relieving poverty in 10 of the poorest Countries in Africa. Rwanda was one of only four countries in Africa to not only achieve, but surpass, the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number within the country without access to safe water and sanitation. Africa AHEAD has been the key mover behind the introduction of Community Health Clubs into other countries through other NGOs: Sierra Leone (CARE International, 2002), Uganda (Care International, 2003), South Africa (Government, 2005; IWRM, Danida 2010), Guinea Bissau (Effective Interventions, 2008), Vietnam (Government/Danida, 2010), Rwanda (Government/UNICEF/WSP, 2010), Namibia (ISOE, 2013) DR Congo (Tear Fund, 2015). It is estimated that by 2015, over 3000 CHCs with over 250,000 members, and 1,542,000 beneficiaries with improved living standards could be attributed to consultancies for these NGOs by Juliet and Anthony Waterkeyn and their teams. This work has been supported by organizations such as the U.K. Department for International Development and Danish International Development Agency. On the basis of this interest they founded Africa AHEAD in 2103 which has systemised the CHC Approach, with a view to replication and scaling up throughout Africa. There are two currently main hubs based in Kigali (Rwanda) and Harare (Zimbabwe) with expert teams of trainers. They offer training for any NGOs or government wishing to embrace the AHEAD approach. They also offer a data base of CHCs on which provides monitoring and evaluation tools for any programmes using the 'Classic CHC' approach. The CHC concept differs from traditional aid approaches that are heavily input-based, and has led to a number of articles in development journals.

Marcy Playground Keefe, along with vocalist John Wozniak and drummer Jared Kotler, founded Marcy Playground in 1994. Although Keefe grew up in the same city as Wozniak, the two never met until both moved to NY and met through a mutual friend, acclaimed jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. Before joining Marcy Playground, he attended the Berklee Music College of Boston with the band's ex-drummer Dan Reiser, with whom he played in various jazz projects together. Keefe is known for being the shy yet funny guy in Marcy Playground. Aside from providing bass guitar for Marcy Playground, he contributed backing vocals on many of the songs on the band's second album, Shapeshifter. His musical influences include Radiohead, classic rock, and jazz. May 31, 1995 A quote from Dylan Keefe about a day that forever changed his life: \\"I can divide my personal history into two distinct parts; pre and post May 31, 1995. On that day my father, an accomplished artist and architect, took his own life. He had always been my greatest inspiration, my wisest confidant, my biggest fan, and my best friend. He was insanely talented, amazingly kind, and aggressively charming. But most of all, although we played in different mediums, he was my artistic soul mate. Somehow, with him in the world, it was easier to a life in the ridiculous pursuit of artistic endeavors. Being totally and completely understood by someone has a way of dissolving self-doubt into bite size pieces. That very same late spring day, before I received that heart-crushing news, I also met John Wozniak. As Minneapolis ex pats living in New York City, we quickly learned that we were from the same town, grew up with similar record collections, and had poor but intellectually stimulating parents that sent us to experimental grade schools. The Marcy Open School was the sister to mine on the other side of town. We were kindred misfit guinea pigs that had been tagged and released into to wild of the normal world. In these times, when its easy for the Privileged such as myself, to just up 'n run away from one's hometown in search of a new identity, it's not everyday that you meet those people that REALLY know where you're coming from. I'm sure some of you that have lost loved ones are familiar with the feeling of being shaken by the irreverence in which life just goes on without them. To this day, I cannot believe that my dad never got to know about Marcy Playground the band, or that Woz and he never met. Because it seems to me as though they had always known each other. Instead, they just passed each other by a few hours along my personal time line. On that day, when my whole world was falling to shit, I got lucky...or maybe blessed or something. Because somehow, just when I really needed some sense of where I came from, and a reminder of why I do what I do, spoken in a language that I can understand, I met Woz. And although John is far from a father figure to me (he's more like the little brother I need to protect from others so I can beat on him myself later), my dad, like a successful drug deal, delivered something to him from under his sleeve as he passed from my street corner. What I got was a musical soul mate. What you get is Marcy Playground.\\" Today Although Dylan is still a part of the rock trio today, for a limited time he was the Technical Director for the weekly public radio program On the Media, based in New York City, and the Technical Director on another NYC-based public radio program The Takeaway. He now serves as the Technical Director for Radiolab. He is currently busy touring the continent, rocking crowds with the band that gained him his stardom, as well as drawing and painting.

In total, the Brussels conference agreed to deliver $4.55 billion for Georgia. The amount far exceeded the $3.25 billion estimate of the World Bank and United Nations. Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said, \\"We are deeply moved and humbled by the demonstration of solidarity and support that we have received,\\" additionally noting the pledges were made despite the ongoing effects of a global financial crisis. He then added that \\"Every single, euro, dollar and pound will make Georgia stronger, more prosperous, freer, more democratic and more genuinely and thoroughly European.\\" \\"(It) will alleviate, to a significant degree, the human suffering that has resulted in the aftermath of the Aug. 7 conflict.\\" Joint summit host, EU External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said of the occasion and its outcome that \\"This is a day of joy.\\"  South Ossetia  left right In September 2008, Russia sent hundreds of workers to rebuild Tskhinvali and promised cash payments for every South Ossetian. South Ossetian Prime Minister Boris Chochiev said that Russia \\"promised to pay South Ossetians up to $2,000 each in compensation for war damage.\\" In September 2008 Russia financed payment of pensions for South Ossetian pensioners, financed aid for unemployed and subsidised families that lost their houses during the war. Russian reconstruction aid for South Ossetia was $490 million. However, there were serious concerns about the effectiveness of the distribution of Russian aid by South Ossetian authorities. In March 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the Finance Ministry to initiate an agreement on financial assistance to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia would allocate 8.5 billion rubles to South Ossetia in order to assist in rebuilding housing, social amenities and utilities damaged during the war. According to Eduard Kokoity, seventy percent of residential housing and eighty percent of administrative buildings in Tskhinval were destroyed in the Georgian shelling of the city in 2008. The Dzuarikau–Tskhinvali gas pipeline from North Ossetia to Tskhinvali was launched on 26 August 2009. The new pipeline was reported to have cost 15 billion rubles (US$476 million). Before the construction, South Ossetia was supplied by gas through the Agara-Tskhinvali leg of the Georgian Tbilisi- Kutaisi trunk system. Dzuarikau-Tskhinvali gas pipeline is one of the highest- altitude pipelines in the world.

Biography =Early life= The eldest son of barrister John Anthony Fonblanque, K.C. and MP, born in Brook Street, London in March 1787, Fonblanque was educated privately at Putney under Mr Applebee. He spent nine months at Charterhouse under Dr Raine, and received private tuition at Epsom for two years under Mr Boucher. He was admitted as \\"pensioner\\" at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, aged 17, on 28 August 1804. He was on the list of scholars from Michaelmas 1804 to Lady Day 1809, and was third in the classical and mathematical examinations, 1805. Fonblanque was one of the founders of the Cambridge Union Society. =War service= In 1810 Fonblanque left Cambridge due to ill-health, a burst blood- vessel on the lungs, and entered the Army obtaining a commission in the 21st Fusiliers. With this regiment he served at Cadiz, Gibraltar, in Sicily and the Greek Islands then in Italy. Lord William Bentinck, under whom he served in Italy, appointed him deputy judge advocate-general. In the American War (of 1812) he was present at the taking of Washington, at the Battle of Baltimore, and ultimately at the fatal repulse at New Orleans when he was made prisoner within the enemy's lines being one of the very few who had succeeded in crossing the works. His last service was with the army of occupation in France in 1815. He left Valenciennes in November 1816 and was almost immediately called to the bar. =The law and its reform= Fonblanque was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, London, 26 November 1816 having kept the necessary terms at Lincoln's Inn during his residence at Cambridge. The next year Lord Eldon appointed him one of the then seventy commissioners of bankruptcy. The abuses and imperfections of the bankruptcy system did not escape his attention and long before law reform became fashionable he published a pamphlet on the subject. Having attracted the notice of Lord Brougham as a law reformer Fonblanque was appointed one of the original Commissioners of the newly instituted Court of Bankruptcy. =Legal writer= With John Paris he wrote Medical Jurisprudence published in 1823. It was awarded the first Swiney Prize for works on jurisprudence; and it remained the only guide on the subject for many years. He was one of the founders of The Jurist in 1826. A quarterly journal of jurisprudence and legislation The Jurist was the first periodical which systematically advocated the amendment of the law. This was considered a bold step. Fonblanque married Caroline O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell of Cork. They had at least two sons and a daughter. He died at Brighton on 3 November 1865.

When the movement began to press for a National Library in Wales, Ballinger kept an eye on progress as was by far the best-known librarian in Wales. Sir John Williams had promised a donation to the new library, and it was he who offered Ballinger the post of librarian, without competition. He began on 1 January 1909, with a salary of £600, £100 more than at his previous post in Cardiff, with a pension. He retired on 31 May 1930 and was thanked by the Court of Governors for: Of his many achievements, there were special mentions for securing the National Library's status as a legal deposit, and gaining \\"the continued interest and support of the general public\\".

DSU also won the 2000 NCAA Division II Championship, with Campbell earning National Coach of the Year honors by three different organizations. His final season at Delta State was the 2001 season. In 2002, Campbell became the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Middle Tennessee State University. At Middle Tennessee, Campbell's offense produced a 1,000-yard rusher and scored more than 20 points against three of the four SEC teams faced, including a win at in-state rival Vanderbilt. In 2003, he then served as offensive line coach for Jackie Sherrill in his last season at Mississippi State before taking the head coaching position at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College in March 2004. At Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College (MGCCC), he went 87–22 (.798) over his ten seasons from 2004 to 2013 despite his predecessor going only 6–12 in his two seasons in charge. Campbell coached Gulf Coast to a NJCAA Junior College co-National Championship in 2007. Several players on that team went on to play in the Southeastern Conference including Eltoro Freeman and Demond Washington at Auburn, Terrence Cody at Alabama and Chris White and Sean Brauchle at Mississippi State. Prior to Campbell's arrival, the Bulldogs football team had not made it to the state playoffs since 1986. In December 2008, Campbell was a finalist for the head coaching position at Northwestern State University. Other finalists included Bradley Dale Peveto, co-defensive coordinator at Louisiana State University and a former Northwestern State assistant, who eventually got the job. On January 12, 2009, Campbell interviewed with new head coach Gene Chizik to fill the vacant position coaching the offensive line at Auburn University, but the job was filled by Colorado assistant head coach Jeff Grimes. Campbell led his 2009 MGCCC Bulldogs team to a 9–2 record after losing 75–71 in the MACJC State Championship game, ending Gulf Coast's bid for three straight MACJC titles. In 2010, Campbell led Gulf Coast to a 10–2 record (the two losses were a combined six points) including a 31-17 win over Copiah-Lincoln in the MACJC Championship game and a 62–53 win versus #3 ranked Grand Rapids (10–1) in the Mississippi Bowl. The combined 115 points set a Mississippi Bowl record.. A member of that team, Don Jones went on to be drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the 2013 NFL draft and made the team as a safety. Under Campbell's leadership, Gulf Coast consistently ranked in the NJCAA National Poll, finishing #13 in 2005, #8 in 2006, #1 in 2007, #4 in 2008, #8 in 2009, #3 in 2010 and #6 in 2011. In December 2013, Campbell was named head football coach at the University of Central Arkansas. From 2014 to 2017, he compiled a record of 33 wins and 15 losses over four seasons. In December 2017, Campbell agreed to a four-year contract with the University of South Alabama that will pay him $600,000 per year, triple what he was earning at FCS Central Arkansas.

Design and development The Pitcairn Aircraft Company built and developed auto-gyros under licence from the Cierva Autogiro Company, trading as the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company from the late 1920s. Interest in the auto-gyro by the USN resulted in the purchase of two Pitcairn PCA-2 autogyros, modified as two-seat observation platforms, designated XOP-1. Trials with the XOP-1s from 1931 had limited success, but included an operational deployment in Nicaragua from June 1932, with the United States Marine Corps (USMC). Following the development of much-improved rotor and control systems, further interest by US armed forces resulted in the Pitcairn PA-33 (YG-2) and Pitcairn PA-34 (XOP-2). These essentially identical aircraft differed mainly in undercarriage design; the PA-33 had fully cantilevered oleo-pneumatic undercarriage legs and the PA-34 had strut mounted split axles with oleo-pneumatic shock-absorbers attached to the top fuselage longerons. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tube with fabric covering and light alloy fairings. The 3-bladed folding rotor was mounted on a braced bi- pod with legs fore and aft of the front cockpit. The tail unit consisted of a very wide chord fin and rudder with a strut supported tail-plane sporting up- turned wing-tips. Tail surfaces were constructed of wood with fabric covering and rotor blades were built with steel tube spars and plywood ribs with fabric covering. Accommodation was in tandem cockpits with the pilot in the rear cockpit aft of the rotor support bi-pod and the observer in the front cockpit beneath the rotor head. Power was supplied by a nose-mounted Wright R-975E-2 in a tight-fitting wide chord cowling with blisters to accommodate rocker arms. The engine was mounted with considerable nose-down angle to ensure prop- wash over the rotor to maintain rotation and ease rotor starting. Control of the aircraft was achieved only by use of the throttle and the tilting rotor- head, operated by a hanging control stick in the rear cockpit. Operational history The YG-2 and OP-2 were briefly tested by the US Army and US Navy, with limited success. After completing tests with the US Army, the YG-2 was taken over by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). registered as NACA 88. On 30 March 1936, whilst on test, NACA 88 suffered a rotor failure, prompting the crew to perform the first successful bail-out from a rotary-winged aircraft.

Life Dodeigne was born in Rouvreux, near Liège. He learned his trade from his father, a stonecutter, who hired him to take courses in drawing and modeling at Tourcoing and Paris at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, where he experienced a revelation in the studio of Marcel Gimond. It was under the influence of the abstract forms of Constantin Brâncuși. He then follows, in 1960, the path of chipped stone that leads to an abrupt figuration, highly expressive, continuing until his most recent sculptures. he also absorbs the counting of Giacometti and Germaine Richier. When asked to recall his early works and his influences, he remains elusive. He exhibited at the Jean Brody Galerie, Galerie Claude Bernard, Gallery Pierre Loeb, the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, then in Berlin, Hanover, Rotterdam, Brussels and Pittsburgh provide him, in the 1960s, international recognition which does not disturb his exploration. In 1968, he devoted himself to a series of sculptures combining new way of smooth surfaces and volumes of irregular stone exploded. In the 1970s, the Group of Ten (Prouvost Foundation, Marcq-en-Barœul) devoted his evolution towards the monumental, which coincides with the simultaneous development of outdoor sculpture in cities and parks. His sculpture populates many cities and museums of North: Lille, Dunkirk, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Antwerp, Liege, Hanover, Utrecht, then Bobigny, Argentan and Paris, to Grenoble in 1998 and Créteil, more recently.

In Switzerland, smartvote has been offering its services since 2003, and since 2005 it has been operated in collaboration with local partners in other countries (e.g. Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Austria).  How it works  smartvote is an online platform, which matches voters to candidates and/or parties that share their policy positions. A voter creates a political profile by filling out a standardised questionnaire with between 30-75 questions on current policy issues. This profile is then matched with the previously gathered profiles of the candidates running and the parties. In contrast to other online voting aids, the candidates answer the smartvote questionnaire themselves. Upon completion of the questionnaire, the voter is presented with a list of candidates or parties (lists) that sorted into descending order in accordance with the extent of their matching with the voter's profile. The Euclidean distance serves as the matching algorithm between the profiles of the voters and those of the candidates or parties. The methodological principles behind the calculations for the conformity ratings and for the graphical evaluations are made transparent on the smartvote website.  Development  smartvote was first developed for the 2003 Swiss parliamentary elections and it was immediately used by a wide section of the public. Since 2004, smartvote has also been offering its services for cantonal and communal elections. By 2018, smartvote had been used for over 200 elections in Switzerland alone. Although smartvote was initially met with some scepticism from Swiss politicians, the profiles of most Swiss members of parliament can now be found on smartvote. The 2007 Swiss parliamentary elections established smartvote as the most important reference source to the Swiss public for establishing the political positions of incumbents and of aspiring candidates. During the 2011 Swiss parliamentary elections and 2015 Swiss parliamentary elections, about 85% of the candidates running for office created a smartvote profile. For each national election the voters made use of smartvote some 1.2 million times (not an indication of the number of users, as a single individual can engage in multiple usage).eDemocracy in Switzerland: Smartvote - a personal report (in German only), checked February 21, 2015 On the basis of the results of the official Swiss Election Study,Swiss Election Studies Selects, checked February 21, 2015 some 15% of the voters in 2011 appeared to have used smartvote as an aid in decision making. In the period from 2005 to 2013, research was conducted into smartvote and its respective use both by candidates standing and by voters, as part of a project undertaken by the National Center of Competence in Research \\"Challenges to Democracy in the 21st Century\\"NCCR Democracy, checked February 21, 2015 at the University of Bern and the University of Lausanne.  Project organization and development  The development of smartvote began in 2001 as a private project with the objective of equipping the electorate with transparent and independent information. The first publicly visible version was produced in 2003 in close collaboration with a private web agency. Since January 2004, smartvote has been operated by PolitoolsPolitools – Political Research Network, checked February 21, 2015 (Politools – Political Research Network) – a registered society based in Bern, being neutral in its politics and having no allegiance to a particular religious denomination, in the sense of Article 60 et sqq. of the Swiss Civil Code. smartvote was developed with reference to the specific characteristics of the Swiss electoral system. It therefore differs, above all, in the following respects, when compared to other online voting aids: * As the Swiss election system shows a strong orientation towards candidates (open lists), smartvote also places the focus on the comparison of voter-to-candidate, while in other countries online voting aids mostly concentrate on the comparison of voter-to-party. * With its 75 questions, the smartvote questionnaire is significantly longer than for other comparable tools. This is also a consequence of the electoral system, because comparisons must on occasions be enabled for more than 800 candidates per Swiss electoral district. * In Switzerland it is far from being the case that all parties stand for election in all electoral districts, so smartvote offers the comparison specifically for each district. This means that voters can compare themselves with parties or with candidates which are actually standing for election in a particular electoral district. * In addition to the comparison in the form of a ranking, smartvote also places particular importance on the visualisation of the comparisons of the positions, e.g. by means of profile graphics for eight political theme areas (so-called smartspider profiles) or by locating the positions on a two-dimensional political map.

Australia is represented in Uruguay through its embassy in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and an honorary consulate in Montevideo.Australian Honorary Consulate in Montevideo Uruguay has an embassy in CanberraEmbassy of Uruguay in Canberra a consulate general in Sydney and honorary consulates in all State capitals. Australia and Uruguay share an interest in the Southern Ocean and the fisheries therein. Both countries are full members of the Cairns Group and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. A number of incidents have taken place in Antarctic waters involving Uruguayan- flagged sailing boats and Australian officers. Political The first Uruguayan Consul came to Australia in 1954. Since 1996, Diego L. Payssé is Australia's Honorary Consul in Montevideo. Both countries are agricultural exporters, and advocate for the reduction and reform of farm subsidies. In 1970, Uruguay joined the International Wool Secretariat, composed of founding members Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. An extradition treaty was signed in 1998. In the lead up to the 2005 selection of director-general of the World Trade Organization, Australia declined to endorse the Uruguayan candidate Carlos Perez del Castillo over Pascal Lamy, despite the countries being agricultural export allies. The two countries' foreign ministers met in New York City during a 2008 United Nations General Assembly meeting and discussed ways to increase links between Australia and Uruguay. =Illegal fishing incidents= In August 2003, the Australian government boarded a suspected illegal fishing vessel, the Viarsa I, in Antarctic waters. The vessel was boarded by personnel from the Australian customs and fisheries patrol boat Southern Supporter, backed by armed South African enforcement officers. A Uruguayan was detained and taken into custody of the Australian government. The detainment of the official caused a rift between Australia and Uruguay, who demanded the official's immediate release. Australian Fisheries Minister Ian Macdonald claimed that the official along with the rest of the crew be charged under Australian law. Uruguay then ordered the fishing vessel home to face local law, causing a strain on the relations between the two countries who each thought the ship should be prosecuted under their own jurisdictions. Still, the two countries stated they were cooperating to resolve their difficulties. Four months after the initial incident, ' intercepted the Uruguayan-flagged Maya V in the Southern Ocean about south west of Perth. Prime Minister John Howard boarded and thanked the crew for their work fighting illegal fishing saying, \\"Australians feel very strongly that people who want to illegally fish in our waters, who want to pillage our assets, should be repelled and, where appropriate, apprehended.\\" Two top officials representing Uruguay and Australia met to discuss issues involving the Maya V incident. Uruguayan Ambassador to Australia Pedro Mo Amaro said in a statement on the news, \\"We agree with all the measures Australian authorities have taken but not with these measures against the crew\\", he went on to say \\"We think the crew is innocent – they have not committed any offences.\\" The crew involved later were charged varying fines and released back to Uruguay.

In that period Australia primarily exported wool, iron, steel, and beef to Uruguay. In 2010 Uruguay investigated the possibility of importing Merino semen and embryos to reinvigorate their sheep industry after substantial declines. Australian investment in Uruguay centres on mining, agriculture, and entertainment, and benefits from the lack of obstacle to repatriation of profits. Although eucalypts are native to Australia, they form the basis for 80% of the Uruguayan forestry industry. Military Australia and Uruguay co-host a series of workshops on the protection of civilians in peacekeeping operations. Cultural and immigration  Uruguayan Australians are an ethnic minority in Australia with populations in larger Australian cities, primarily Sydney (especially Fairfield) and Melbourne. The first migrants from Uruguay came to Australia during the 1960s during a time of political and economical hardship, with growing numbers in the 70s due to military dictatorship with the migration peak in 1974. By 1981 the Uruguayan population in Australia reached almost 9300, then after the restoration of democracy in Uruguay it rose slowly to 9715 in 1996. In 1981 80% lived in New South Wales, and 17% in Victoria. In 2002 the Uruguayan consul-general promoted soccer in Australia, saying \\"the only thing [Uruguayan and Latin American people] miss is that this is not a soccer country\\".

According to BBC News, Singh was the first female journalist to be killed in Nepal.  Personal  Uma Singh was a twenty-six-year-old female who lived in Janakpur, Nepal. Singh was born in Siraha District, Gamahariya VDC, Maheshput Ward 4. Singh's mother name that was still living name Sushila Devi Singh. Singh was cremated by her nephew, who worked in Janakpur.  Career  Uma Singh was a reporter for Janakpur Today daily newspaper and for Radio Today FM, which were owned by the same company. She was recognized by multiple things including her articles in the newspaper attacking the dowry system, her home Nepal, and she talks about how fathers who have daughter grant the man, their daughter is going to marry, land and lots of money after they are gone. Not only did she talk about home stuff but she also talked about woman's rights, the caste system and also about politics. Her job was in her hometown and was told to be in a sketchy area, where people were armed at all times. Singh's manager or boss of the radio station stated that she was, \\"Very brave and multi-talented\\" (Brij Kumar Yadav).  Death  Singh was murdered in her home in Janakpur, Nepal on January 11, 2009. She lived by herself in an apartment that she rented. On January 11, 2009 she came home from work in the evening and was making dinner when 12-20 men came into her apartment and started stabbing her with sharp objects. Singh had many stab wounds on every part of her body. She died on the way to the hospital from multiple stab wounds. Singh had neighbors, but they never heard anything, which means there are no witnesses. At first her killers were unknown but later revealed to be Lalita Devi Singh, Nemlal Paswan, Shraban Yadav, Bimlesh Jha, and Abhishek Singh. Lalita Singh was Uma Singh's sister-in-law, Pawswan and Abhishek Singh were known for criminal elements, Yadav was a district-leel activist of the UCPN(M), and Jha was a party activist of the Terai Ekta Parishad. Lalita Singh, Yadav, and Nemlal Paswasn are serving life sentences and the others were \\"handed down clean chits by the court.\\" =Investigation= The police did an investigation on Singh's death. One reason they did an investigation was because Singh's father and brother disappeared from their home in 2007. They believe that the same people were behind this as they were for Singh's death. After Singh's father and brother disappeared, Singh moved to Janakpur and started her job at the daily newspaper and the local FM station. She wrote an article in 2008, where she stated, \\"The Maoists have not returned the seized land in Siraha district even three months after Maoist chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal directed his party cadres to do so. Some 1,200 bigahas of land captured during the People's War is still under Maoist control.\\" This was written five days before Singh was murdered. The investigation ended and the result came to be that the killers of Singh were after the family land that Singh had the title to. A life sentence was handed down to the ring leader. Umesh Yadav, also known as Swamiji, who was arrested by police was convicted of being the mastermind of the killing. Yadav got life imprisonment by the District Court, Dhanusa in April 2015. Uma's sister-in-law Lalita Devi Singh and Nemwal Paswan are in the jail already for the same crime.  Context  Singh's career was ignored by most police officers because it was a possible motive. Before Singh was killed, she told the UN Mission in Nepal, \\"It is a big problem working in the Terai region.\\" She talked about how society does not accept women. The Chief of Singh's newspaper thought the reason Singh got killed was because she criticized local politicians and the dowry system.  Impact  After Singh's death, a woman by the name of Manika Jha received death threats, they busted in her windows and marked her door with a cross saying \\"now it is your turn.\\" Jha was a correspondent for the Kantipur Daily. Many death threats were given out, one by the name of Shanker Mishra, leader of Terai Madhesh Loktantik Party. He sent this out to Mahesh Kumar Das, a reporter for Nagarik Dainik and news coordinator for Radio Mirchi FM 89.6. Singh was the first journalist to be murdered in Nepal. She was known because of what she has tried to do for Nepal. Singh was part of being a Women's Right activist and was with the newspaper and radio station. People in the Mahottari, Salahi, Sindhuli,Siraha, and Sapatari zones are mourning Singh's death and are wearing black bands around their wrists to protest. The Monday after Singh's death all six FM radio stations in Janakpur did not air an entertainment program or news. After the mourning of Singh,Many people of Nepal started protesting for the right to protect journalist, especially women that talk about human rights. After Singh's death Article 19 stated that \\"It was emphasized that the lack of effective investigation and culture impunity in Nepal had created a precedent whereby perpetrators see attacks pass without consequence.\\" People in club Nepal decided to make an award in memory Singh. They called it, Uma Singh Courageous Journalism Award. This award had an amount of 25,000 Indian Rupee and a letter of appreciation.  Reactions  Koichiro Matsuura, director- general of UNESCO, said, \\"I condemn the brutal murder of Uma Singh. If Nepal is to uphold the two basic human rights of freedom of expression and equal rights of men and women, it will need to bring the culprits of this crime to justice. This is not only an attack on an individual, but a blow to Nepalese society as a whole.\\" Reporters Without Borders said, \\"Our first thoughts are with her family and friends. We ask the authorities to react quickly and to do their utmost to protect journalists in Nepal and to quickly arrest this group of killers. This kind of appalling murder must not go unpunished if the Nepalese press is to go about its work freely.\\" The Committee to Protect Journalists said it \\"welcomes the arrest of a suspected mastermind in Uma Singh's murder case as a significant first step However, only a robust effort by authorities to prosecute and deliver a just verdict will help to reverse deep-rooted impunity for journalist murders in Nepal.\\" A spokesperson for International Federation of Journalists said, \\"We welcome the conviction of Umesh Yadav bringing the case of Uma Singh's murder to a close. We applaud the local authorities for continuing to fight for justice for Uma and ensure that the perpetrators and mastermind are brought to justice.\\"  References   External links  * YouTube Video: Slain woman journalist of Nepal 1983 births 2009 deaths Nepalese journalists People murdered in Nepal Murdered Nepalese journalists 20th-century journalists ","title":"Uma Singh"},{"id":"21105230","title":"Finesse Juvenile Novices' Hurdle"},{"id":"21105231","text":"Elisabeth \\"Eli\\" Pinedo Sáenz (born 13 May 1981) is a retired Spanish handball player.

The project, which originally consisted of two dams along the river, was proposed as early as the 1960s by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to supply electricity to the railbelt region of Alaska (areas served by the Alaska Railroad), including the cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks. At the time, it was known as the Devil's Canyon Dam, for its location just upstream of Devils Canyon, a -deep gorge and whitewater rapids formed by the Susitna River. When oil prices and state revenue (based on taxes levied on oil extraction) declined, the plan was put on hold. When oil prices rose to then-record highs in 2008, the rising price of electricity in Alaska caused a revival of interest in the proposal. The Susitna Hydroelectric project, to be built by the Alaska Energy Authority, was projected to cost $5.2 billion. A dam would be built on the Susitna River about north of Anchorage, forming a reservoir. The dam would consistently produce between 280 and 300 megawatts of power, or about 2,800 GWh per year. The dam would be designed to accommodate a future height increase to . Electricity from the dam would supply about two-thirds of Alaska's population. The alternative is use of natural gas as fuel for generators. Whether to build a natural gas pipeline is also at issue. The Susitna river, which drains into the Cook Inlet, is a major salmon spawning ground. The site of the proposed dam is upstream of the breeding grounds of salmon, but if the dam is constructed the pattern of flow in the river will change due to operation of the dam. On June 29, 2016, Alaska's governor Bill Walker vetoed the construction of the dam. The reasons were both environmental and economic. http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2016/06/governor-vetoes-funding-to- develop-459-mw-susitna-watana- hydroelectric.htmlhttp://www.hatchmag.com/articles/no-su-dam-alaskan-governor- cancels-susitna-river-hydro/7713552 Notes  External links  * Alaska Energy Authority reports on Susitna * Coalition for Susitna Dam Alternatives * Fairbanks Utilities cost more than double the national average * Fairbanks winter air quality fails to meet EPA standards * Ground Truth Trekking technical information on the dam plus Ground Truth journey Hydroelectric power plants in Alaska Buildings and structures in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska Proposed hydroelectric power stations ","title":"Susitna Hydroelectric Project"},{"id":"21105266","text":"Jessica Alonso Bernardo (born 20 September 1983 in Gijón) is a former Spanish handball player, who was of the Spanish women's national team.

In March 1838, France imposed a two-year blockade of Río de la Plata against Argentina during the War of the Confederation. In 1839, the Uruguayan Civil War commenced. From the beginning, France looked for allied forces to fight Buenos Aires Governor, Juan Manuel de Rosas, on their behalf. For this purpose the French supported Uruguayan President Fructuoso Rivera and helped him to defeat Constitutional President Manuel Oribe, who was on good terms with Governor Rosas. On 24 October 1838, Manuel Oribe resigned and fled to Buenos Aires, and Fructuoso Rivera assumed power.Garibaldi in Uruguay: A Reputation Reconsidered At the end of the 19th century, the French community represented about a third of Uruguay's population, most from the French Basque Country and Béarn Province.Francia y Uruguay (in Spanish) In 1973, Uruguay entered into a civic- military dictatorship. As a result, political opponents were persecuted and many fled to exile, most to other Latin American nations.

Background Skandinaven was established by three Norwegian immigrants; John Anderson, Knud Langeland (1813–88), and Iver Lawson (1822–72). John Anderson administered the business side of the newspaper. Iver Lawson was the landlord who provided a location and facilities. Knud Langeland was the first editor of Skandinaven. Skandinaven headquarters in Chicago c. 1890 Knud Langeland was an immigrant from Samnanger, Hordaland County, Norway. He arrived in the United States in 1843 and settled in Racine County, Wisconsin. In the fall of 1849 Langeland and his brother-in-law, O. J. Hatlestad, bought the printing press of the weekly, Nordlyset, from Even Hansen Heg and James DeNoon Reymert. This pioneer Norwegian newspaper publication ceased for financial reasons in October 1851. In the fall of 1859, Langeland was elected by Racine County voters to the Wisconsin State Assembly. Langeland occupied the editorial chair of Skandinaven until 1881. Knud Langeland: Pioneer Editor (Arlow W. Andersen Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XIV: Page 122) Iver Lawson was an investor who came to prosperity buying and selling real estate in Chicago during the mid-19th century. He also entered city politics, becoming a member of the city council in 1864. After the death of Iver Lawson in 1872, his son Victor F. Lawson took over the administration of his father's estate, which included his interest in Skandinaven. Victor Lawson would become the owner and publisher of the Chicago Daily News, the most widely read publication in Chicago during the late 19th century.Biography of Victor Freemont Lawson (Inventory of the Victor Lawson Papers) John Anderson, who was brought by his parents from Voss, in Hordaland County, Norway to Chicago in 1845, had worked initially for the Chicago Tribune. Anderson decided in 1866 to leave the Chicago Tribune to start his own Norwegian-language newspaper. Anderson purchased the subscription lists of Norske-Amerikanerne, a failing Norwegian language newspaper. Langeland and Lawson briefly established a rival paper, Amerika. Skandinaven merged with Amerika in 1873 to form Skandinaven og Amerika. Nordmændene i Amerika (Martin Ulvestad, Volume I. History Book Company’s Forlag, Minneapolis, MN 1907) Operations Starting the 1870s Skandinaven published a magazine that contained articles of interest, stories, and poetry. It carried works by Norwegian-American writers including Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen and Rasmus B. Anderson. Skandinaven became one of the most influential and successful newspapers in the Scandinavian immigrant community. Through the success of the paper, Anderson was able to build a publishing business that became the largest venture of its kind. In 1890 the firm was incorporated as the John Anderson Publishing Company. First Sagas in a New World: A Study of The Beginnings of Norwegian-American Literature (Thorson, Gerald H.

Project manager: Barbara Walden. University of Wisconsin- Madison. 2004-2005) From 1892 to 1911, Nicolai A. Grevstad was editor of Skandinaven. After 1900, the company began to suffer attrition. The gradual assimilation of Norwegian immigrants into the American population resulted in a dwindling reader base. Anundsen Publishing Company of Decorah, Iowa bought Skandinaven's subscriptions, with the intent of merging the subscription base with that of its own Norwegian language newspaper, the Decorah Posten.

When Skandinaven suspended publication, Reidar Rye Haugan established the Chicago based, Norwegian language newspaper Viking on which he served as both editor and publisher. In 1958, Chicago journalist Bertram Jensenius (1898-1976) took over Viking, renamed it Vinland and published it until his death in 1976.

It contributes around 2% of GDP. Around two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one third to arable crops. Agriculture is heavily subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy and it is not known how large a sector it would be if the market was unregulated. The GDP from the farming sector is argued by some to be a small return on the subsidies given but is argued by others that subsidy boosts food security and therefore is justified in the same way defence spending is. The main crops that are grown are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits and vegetables. The livestock that is raised include cattle and sheep. In the drier east, farmers grow wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and sugar beets. History Based on studies of medieval manorial accounts eastern Norfolk and areas along the northern coast were among the most productive, devoting large areas to legume cultivation alongside wheat and barley. The planting of legumes, commonly used as a fodder crop, protected soil fertility due to their nitrogen fixing capabilities. In soils where this intensive cropping wasn't possible—the sandy soils of Breckland or Norwich, and the \\"Good Sands\\" in Norfolk's northwest—the fields were sown with rye and barley. Between the 16th century and the mid-19th century, Great Britain saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. (See: British Agricultural Revolution.) New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanisation, four-field crop rotation and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. By the early 19th century, agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before. In the late nineteenth century a slump badly affected arable farming, known as the Great Depression, which is usually dated from 1873 to 1896. The depression was caused by the dramatic fall in grain prices following the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation in the 1870s and the advent of cheap transportation with the rise of steam ships.T. W. Fletcher, ‘The Great Depression of English Agriculture 1873-1896’, in P. J. Perry (ed.), British Agriculture 1875-1914 (London: Methuen, 1973), pp. 31. The 18th and 19th centuries also saw the development of glasshouses, or greenhouses, initially for the protection and cultivation of exotic plants imported to Europe and North America from the tropics. Experiments on plant hybridisation in the late 19th century yielded advances in the understanding of plant genetics, and subsequently, the development of hybrid crops. Storage silos and grain elevators appeared in the 19th century.

Germany is Uruguay's principal trading partner in the European Union. History Embassy of Germany in Montevideo Embassy of Uruguay in Berlin Starting in the 1850s German immigrants have made an important contribution to the development of Uruguay. Uruguay offered asylum to German Jews starting in 1935. Mennonite communities emigrated from Germany to Uruguay after World War II, starting in 1948. During World War I, Uruguay sided against Germany and broke off diplomatic relations. On December 13, 1939, the Battle of the River Plate took place off the coast of Uruguay where British forces sunk the German Graf Spee. There was a Diplomatic Battle with Dr. Alberto Guani as Uruguayan Foreign Minister that ruled a 72-hour timeline for the ship to remain in Montevideo harbour. Most of the Graf Spee’s surviving crew of 1,150 were interned in Uruguay and Argentina and many remained after the war. A German Embassy official in Uruguay said his government has sent an official letter stating its position as to whether Germany claims ownership of the vessel. The German claim would be invalid because early in 1940 the Nazi government sold salvaging rights to the vessel to a Uruguayan businessman who was acting on behalf of the British government. However, any salvaging rights would have expired under Uruguayan law. By 1940 Germany had threatened to break of diplomatic relations with Uruguay. Nazi Germany protested that Uruguay gave safe harbor to the Carnarvon Castle after it was attacked by a Nazi raider. The ship was repaired with steel plate reportedly salvaged from the Graf Spee. On January 25, 1942 Uruguay broke diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany. After World War II, Uruguay established diplomatic relations with both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In October 2011, Uruguayan President José Mujica paid an official visit to Germany. Cultural There is a Goethe Institute in Uruguay. The German School of Montevideo, is a German binational school that opened in 1857. It was the first German School to open in South America. There is a joint Uruguay Germany university-entrance examination which qualifies takers for university in both countries. A German-language school is run by the Mennonites. A cultural cooperation accord was signed on 8 May 1989. Trade Exports to Germany from Uruguay were worth EUR 205 million and Uruguayan imports from Germany were EUR 133 million in 2009. Germany is the country’s principal trading partner in the European Union. Germany is fifth overall among export countries to Uruguay, after Brazil, the USA, Argentina and Mexico. Germany is seventh on the list of import countries, after Brazil, Argentina, the USA, China, Venezuela and Russia. Uruguay is 84th among suppliers of German imports and 108th among buyers of German exports.

He was known as the 'master of colours' for the transparency and interplay of his colours. He is known as Jehan Bellegambe the elder to distinguish him from his descendants who were also called Jehan. Life Bellegambe was born and died in Douai, then in the county of Flanders (today in French Flanders).

A longtime reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle, known under his pen name Francis O'Pake, he and then city editor Joseph Howard, Jr. were responsible for publishing a forged document to manipulate the price of gold on the New York Stock Exchange resulting in the \\"Great Civil War Gold Hoax\\". Early life Francis Mallison was born in Rome, New York to a Methodist family from Connecticut. His father was a local schoolteacher. He attended the Oneida Conference Seminary, the Polytechnic School at Chittenango and the Seminary at Lowville. Mallison received common school training and began contributing to the Rome Sentinel shortly after leaving school. Mallison also traveled to the western United States in 1849 and the southern United States in 1851-1852, studying the culture and economic issues in these areas. He also worked as a telegraph operator in Central New York.Harlow, S.R. and S.C. Hutchins. Life Sketches of State Officers, Senators and Members of the Assembly of the State of New York in 1868. Albany: Weed, Parsons & Company, 1868. (pg. 291–293) Editing He eventually gained editorial control of the Rome Sentinel and remained editor until he moved to Brooklyn in November 1859, whereupon he took a position at the City News. He became acquainted with many prominent New Yorkers while on the paper and, upon its reorganization, joined the Brooklyn Eagle. Mallison eventually became city editor of the Brooklyn Eagle himself, but was forced to retire due to poor health. However, his position gained him valuable political connections and he was admitted to the bar in December 1866. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co., 4th D.) in 1868. He remained in journalism as a political correspondent while a member of the Legislature and resumed it on a full-time basis after the end of his term. In 1870, he was appointed Deputy Clerk of the Brooklyn City Court and held the position until September 1875. Controversy While Mallison was with the Brooklyn Eagle, he and city editor Joseph Howard, Jr. conspired to forge a document, under the guise of an Associated Press dispatch, which claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was calling for 400,000 men to be conscripted into the Union Army. The news of the draft caused the stock market to crash, while the price of gold went up. Mallison and Howard made a large profit, but detectives managed to track down Mallison two days after the document had been published. He implicated Howard in the deception, and the two were arrested. Mallison was held as a prisoner of war at Fort Lafayette for six months before his release on September 23, 1864.\\"Death of F.A. Mallison\\". _New York Times._ 23 Jun 1877 Retirement and death Retiring to private life, he traveled to South America for his health and remained abroad for four months.

Distribution Although Fauna Europaea mentioned the species only from Italy as recent as 2013,Fauna europaea it is clear that the species has been present further north much earlier. In 2003, the species was discovered in Devon, after which the species has also been encountered in multiple other counties in the south of England and Wales. The species has also recently been recorded in Croatia, Germany, France, the Netherlandswhere it was first caught in 1985, but misidentified as M. cinnamomea Switzerland and Belgium and appears to be spreading its range. Specimen of M. italica are sometimes mislabelled as the more widespread species Metalampra cinnamomea, from which it differs in ground colour of the forewing. It is not clear whether M. italica has recently spread to Central Europe or if its presence there had merely so far remained unnoticed, at least in part due to misidentification of specimens as M. cinnamomea. Multiple occurrences of such misidentification in collections have been confirmed. Habitat This species occurs in forest environments, preferably in deciduous forest. Appearance The wingspan of Metalampra italica can reach 10–14 mm.Naturhistoriska Riskmuseet These moths have bright reddish brown forewings with contrasting pale yellow longitudinal stripes on the sides and on the thorax. Antennae are dark brown with light rings. Hindwings are greyish. The species appears somewhat similar to Metalampra cinnamomea, but fresh specimens can be distinguished by the ground colour of the forewing. Both species have a shade of brown as ground colour, but that of M. italica is a more red brown, whereas M. cinnamomea has a greyish brown. The ground colour of M. italica is also lighter than that of M. cinnamomea. As a result, the yellow markings on the forewings appear more pronounced on M. cinnamomea. The species can also be distinguished by their genitalia. Behaviour and host plants The larvae feed in decaying wood, usually Quercus spp., beneath the bark and near several species of fungus, where they weave a loose web. It is unclear whether the larvae's food source is the wood, bark, fungi or a mixture thereof. Larvae are found from autumn to May, as well as in July. Adults occur from late May to July, and again in August. They fly both day and night and comes to light.

Career Beeke was elected a scholar of Corpus Christi, Oxford in May 1769. He gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1773, a Master of Arts degree in 1776, a Bachelor of Divinity in 1785, and a Doctorate in Divinity in 1800. In 1775 Beeke became a fellow of Oriel College and was Junior Proctor of the University in 1784. Beeke was Regius Professor of Modern History between 1801 and 1813. Beeke was vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford in 1782, rector of Ufton Norcot, Berkshire in 1789, Dean of Bristol in 1813, and vicar of Weare in 1819. Beeke gained a reputation as a fiscal expert following his 1799 Observations on the produce of the income tax, and on its proportion to the whole income of Great Britain, which was expanded and reprinted in 1800. Beeke's unpublished manuscripts and correspondence also show his wider interests in economics. Beekite, a distinctive form of chalcedony which occurs in the preservation of fossils by silicification, was named to honour Beeke. Beeke was very interested in botany. He made contributions to Lysons' Magna Britannia records, and corresponded with Sir James Edward Smith, a fellow and first president of the Linnean Society of London. Beeke is credited as the binomial author of at least one plant species, Lotus pilosus Beeke, first described and published in Turner and Dillwyn's Botanical Guide. This species was later thought to be Lotus uliginosus Schkuhr, which is now settled as a synonym of Lotus pedunculatus Cav., a kind of trefoil. Beeke died at Torquay on 9 March 1837.
