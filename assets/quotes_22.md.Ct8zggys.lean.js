The game was released worldwide on May 16, 2007, available free to all Xbox Live members in North America. On January 21, 2016, it was announced as an Xbox One Backwards Compatible title. It has remained free as a digital download on the Xbox One.https://majornelson.com/2016/01/21/new-xbox-one-backward- compatibility-titles-are-now-available/  Gameplay  Typical gameplay screenshot of Aegis Wing. Aegis Wing is a side-view scrolling shooter, where the player controls a small ship pitted against countless foes. While the scrolling backgrounds in the game are strictly non-interactive, the player must also avoid stationary mines positioned at certain points. There is a boss at the end of some stages, requiring numerous shots to defeat. While the ship has only a single non-upgradeable main weapon, the player can collect one of four power-ups to grant access to a super weapon with a limited number of uses. Only a single super weapon can be carried at once The title supports up to four players playing cooperatively, either on the same console or via Xbox Live. If more than one player is playing, players can choose to temporarily attach their ship to that of their allies. When this occurs, one player pilots the combined ship, while the remaining player(s) are able to fire in a 360-degree arc. The super weapons become more powerful with each ship added to the formation. In co-op, when a player dies, destroyed enemies sometimes leave behind a \\"back ship\\" power-up; the surviving players can pick this up to resurrect one of their dead teammates.  Plot  The game takes place in 2105 where the Earth's environment is devastated and humankind travels through space in search of a new home world. Upon finding and settling upon the planet Europa, the human colonists are attacked by the space military of an alien colony-people known as the Araxians. After studying downed Araxian fighter technology, the humans develop a powerful space ship capable of using great firepower to be used against the Araxia in the war for Europa.  Development  According to an IGN developer's spotlight, the game was created when Microsoft's J Allard proposed a summer internship focused on game design. In response, three Microsoft interns, Scott Brodie, Danny Dyer and Matt Monson, created Aegis Wing in the summer of 2006. Dyer and Monson had been active members of the Texas Aggie Game Developers, a student organization at Texas A&M; University that encourages video game development among students. The three did all of the initial development work within their small team, although with artwork and audio support from other sources. The game was later brought to Xbox Live Arcade with assistance from Carbonated Games. As the Microsoft XNA toolkit was not yet ready when the team began work, the team was required to create several of their own tools. Due to the limited time period available (i.e., just 3 months), they were also forced to remove certain features in order to maintain their schedule. For example, a planned ability to allow players to merge their ships in multiple configurations was scaled back to a more-manageable single configuration. Nonetheless, the interns were able to finish their work on Aegis Wing by the end of the summer, handing the game off to Carbonated Games for final polish before release.  Reception  Aegis Wing has received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/aegis-wing/  References   External links   Category:2007 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Freeware games Category:Microsoft games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Alien invasions in video games ","title":"Aegis Wing"},{"id":"11182473","text":"Goats Don't Shave are an Irish folk rock band formed in 1990. Formed in Dungloe, County Donegal, the group was fronted by singer-songwriter Pat Gallagher and backed by musicians, Charlie Logue (keyboards), Declan Quinn (whistle), Gerry Coyle (bass), Se√°n Doherty (acoustic guitar), Jason Philbin (fiddle) and Michael Gallagher (drums). The group released two albums together, The Rusty Razor (1992) and Out in the Open (1994). After a sabbatical which has lasted from 1995 onwards, a third album T√≥r was released in 1998 containing material from both Pat Gallagher and Goats Don't Shave. They are probably most well known for their songs \\"Let the World Keep on Turning\\" and \\"Las Vegas (In the Hills of Donegal)\\", both taken from their debut album The Rusty Razor. History Their name comes from a pub incident in which a tipsy local character was told to stop acting the goat and have a shave and clean himself up - his response was to walk away muttering the words \\"goats don't shave!!\\" Since their formation back in the summer of 1990, Goats Don't Shave have risen to become one of the most popular bands Ireland has produced. (citation needed) They began performing their Celtic folk-rock in between their day jobs; which included a few fishermen, at which point the lads started to pick up regular Gigs. Next they recorded their first EP. There were five songs on it, and began to sell them locally. The sales were so good that record companies started calling and so did RT√â and The Late Late Show. Led by singer/songwriter Pat Gallagher, the Goats became one of Ireland‚Äôs most outstanding bands in the early 1990s with top ten singles and a platinum selling album. Formed around 1989, the Goats‚Äô initial success came with their singles:\\"Las Vegas in the Hills of Donegal\\" and \\"Let the World Keep on Turning\\", both which subsequently featured on their debut album, \\"The Rusty Razor\\". The Goats soldout concert venues the length and breadth of Ireland, the UK, Europe and North America. They played both Glastonbury and Finsbury Park Fleadh whilst also being voted Best Band of 1993 by Time Out, one of London‚Äôs leading listings magazines. By the time of the 1994 release of their second album \\"Out in the Open\\", the Goats‚Äô heavy touring schedule had undoubtedly refined their performance. All the songs on both albums were composed by Pat Gallagher. In 1992, the Goats released their first album through Cooking Vinyl, The Rusty Razor. This fiery mix of folk, traditional music and rock was hailed by critics as an absolute classic, and the album went gold in Ireland. Following such success they released a second album in 1994, Out in the Open, a rockier, much rounder piece which maintained their well earned reputation as a band capable of great things. Reunions and Return to the road The band reformed in 2003 to play at the popular Mary From Dungloe International Festival, the concert each year is usually held in the town's Main Street, however due to over 2,000 people showing up to see the bands rare performance it was moved to The Cope car park. Due to popular demand, the Goats decided to reform in 2012. They headed back to the studio to record a new Album the new Album \\"Songs from Earth\\" was released in March 2014 and was followed by promotional tours in Ireland, Scotland and the UK. In August 2013, the Goats released one of their new songs: \\"The Little King\\", dedicated to the memory of the young Glasgow boxer, Benny Lynch, whose parents come from Donegal, Ireland. Following the release of \\"The Little King\\", the Goats were invited to play at Ballyshannon Folk Festival and Letterkenny Live. The Goats also played to a 40,000+ crowd at Celtic Park prior to one of Celtic‚Äôs football games in November 2013 and later that night at a sold out gig at the Classic Grand Rock Venue in the city. The Goats‚Äô most popular songs have been covered by dozens of other bands and a Goats Don‚Äôt Shave song is in practically every jukebox in watering holes around the world.

The Sustainable Forestry Initiative is the world's largest single forest certification standard by area. The SFI is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario Canada and Washington D.C. USA. In 2005, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, which itself is the world's largest forest certifications system, recognized the SFI standard. SFI Program The SFI Forest Management Standard covers key values such as protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration. A new set of SFI 2015-2019 Standards and Rules, developed through an open review process, took effect on Jan. 1, 2015. All SFI certifications require independent, third- party audits and are performed by internationally accredited certification bodies. The SFI Standards are revised and updated every five years to incorporate the latest scientific information and to respond to emerging issues. As part of this process, comments were received during two 60-day public comment periods in 2013 and 2014, and input was received from 12 public workshops across the United States and Canada. About 10,000 stakeholders were invited to submit comments. Participants included public and private landowners, forest sector representatives, Indigenous communities, conservation groups, industry, academia and government officials. Independent oversight was provided at each stage of the revision process by the SFI External Review Panel, a group of independent experts representing conservation, professional, academic and public organizations, operating at arm's length from SFI. The SFI External Review Panel reviewed every public comment submitted to ensure that all comments were considered, and to guarantee the Standard revision process was transparent, objective and credible. The responses to comments are posted on the SFI website. The SFI Program only certifies lands in the United States and Canada, and program participants must comply with all applicable laws. For sources outside of North America without effective laws, participants must avoid illegal or other controversial sources. The SFI Program supports activities by international experts to find ways to address the problem of illegal logging and is a member of the international, multi-stakeholder Forest Legality Alliance. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard promotes responsible forestry practices based on 14 Principles, 13 Objectives, 21 Performance Measures and 55 Indicators that address the 90 percent of the world's forests that are not certified. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard distinguishes SFI from all other forest certification programs in that it sets mandatory practice requirements for the responsible procurement of all fiber, even if it is sourced from non-certified land. These fiber sourcing requirements include measures to broaden the practice of biodiversity, use best management practices to protect water quality, and utilize the services of forest management and harvesting professionals. Because it governs how SFI Program Participants procure fiber from non-certified land, supporters argue that the Standard encourages the spread of responsible forestry practices. SFI has certified more than 285 million acres (115 million hectares) to its standard in the United States and Canada. At the end of October 2010, SFI had 959 chain of custody certifications at 2,339 locations. According to the United Nations, SFI was the fastest growing organization for chain of custody certifications in 2008. SFI sponsored a world record attempt for tree planting. During this attempt in May of 2015, 29 teams came together to plant 202,935 trees in one hour across North America. The teams included youth, community groups and industry partners. The Board of Directors that governs the SFI program has three chambers that recognize economic, environmental and social sectors equally. Directors include representatives of environmental, conservation, professional and academic groups, independent professional loggers, family forest owners, public officials, labor and the forest products industry. Reviews and comparisons  =Third-party reviews = The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization, in its 2009-2010 Forest products Annual Review, says: \\"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\\" Dovetail Partners Inc., in its 2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report, states: \\"the previous differences between forest certification programs are much less distinct ... each program generally has the same structural programmatic requirements, although the required content and level of detail provided by each may vary considerably.\\" SFI is generally considered less stringent than that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). For example, SFI allows more tree farming and does not require conservation plans or consultation with local and indigenous stakeholders (except for public lands). SFI is less highly rated than FSC for example by Consumer Reports ‚ÄúGreener Choices‚Äù, and Green America.FSC: The Premier Forest Certification Program , by Jennifer Gerholdt, Magazine PAPER Project Coordinator Others rate SFI/PEFC and FSC equally: TerraChoice (part of Underwriters Laboratories Global Network) in its 2010 Sins of Greenwashing report, like its 2009 one, counts the SFI/PEFC and FSC in its second-tier list of \\"legitimate\\" environmental standards and certifications.; as does Environment Canada's EcoLogo. A National Association of State Foresters forest certification policy statement passed by resolution in 2008 states: \\"While in different manners, the ATFS (American Tree Farm System), FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability. . . . No certification program can credibly claim to be ‚Äòbest‚Äô, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility.\\" = Green Building Council = On April 5, 2016, the U.S. Green Building Council issued a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) pilot alternative compliance path (ACP) designed to screen out illegal forest products from LEED buildings. While the ACP is being tested as a credit, it will ultimately become a prerequisite that applies to all LEED projects. As a pilot, the ACP does not become a permanent part of the LEED standard without an affirmative vote of the USGBC membership. The ACP pilot recognizes all certified sources - FSC, PEFC, SFI and ATFS and programs. The ACP will apply to all LEED v4 rating systems including Homes v4 and to all LEED 2009 rating systems. The ACP categorizes the various forest certification standards based on the ASTM D7612-10 (2015) standard, which is titled ‚ÄúCategorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources.‚Äù ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards. Other green building tools, including two American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-approved rating systems in the United States ‚Äì ANSI-ICC 700-2008: National Green Building Standard and ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Assessment Protocol for Commercial Buildings (formerly Green Globes U.S.) ‚Äì Green Globes and Built Green Canada recognize wood products certified by credible third-party certification programs like SFI. = Conservation organizations = The SFI Program is supported by conservation groups such as Conservation International, American Bird Conservancy, Ducks Unlimited, and the Conservation Fund (which serves on its Board). Unlike SFI, the FSC included environmental groups such as Greenpeace among its founders. The National Wildlife Federation and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) currently serve on the FSC Board. The Sierra Club endorses only FSC. Critiques of SFI =Marketing practices= On September 9, 2009 the Washington State Forest Law Center, on behalf of the environmental protection group ForestEthics, filed complaints against SFI Inc. with the Federal Trade Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. The FTC complaint accuses SFI Inc. of misleading consumers with deceptive marketing practices. The complaint cites various aspects of SFI's marketing, including its claim that it is an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù not-for-profit organization, its dependence on the timber industry for funding, and the vagueness of SFI's environmental standards, which allow SFI-certified landowners to be certified merely because the landowner is complying with state environmental regulations. The complaint cites SFI's certification as an example of greenwash. Both the FTC and IRS investigated the complaints made against SFI and found them without merit. No action was taken by either investigative body. =Conflict of interest= The complaint filed with the IRS requests an examination of SFI Inc.‚Äôs non-profit status, based on the fact that SFI benefits the private interests of its corporate landowners and not the public interest, as well as the fact that SFI draws more than 80% of its funding from the wood and paper industry. The complaint asserts that in serving the private interests of wood and paper companies that want a ‚Äògreen‚Äô image, SFI is inappropriately granted a nonprofit status reserved for public charities.Washington State Forest Law Center complaint against SFI filed with IRS The IRS investigated the complaint as well as conducted a thorough examination of SFI's non-profit status and concluded that it was appropriate and that no further action was required. = Sierra Club complaint = The Sierra Club has lodged a formal complaint with the SFI, alleging that Weyerhaeuser engaged in risky and irresponsible logging on steep slopes that led to 1,259 landslides in 2007 on SFI-certified Weyerhaeuser lands in Washington state. Challenging SFI to back up its claims of 'independence' and 'rigorous audits,' the Sierra Club requested that Weyerhaeuser's SFI certification be revoked. A peer reviewed landslide study concluded that the Washington State landslides that the Sierra Club attributed to Weyerhaeuser's logging practices were the result of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and not the result of steep slope logging by the company. Landslides occur on both logged and unlogged sites, but science shows that logging (and logging roads) dramatically increase the risk of landslides.

His works include New York State Inebriate Asylum, Monday Afternoon Club, Phelps Mansion and the First National Bank of Oxford.  Life and career  The New York State Inebriate Asylum Connecticut Street Armory, Buffalo Niagara Falls Armory, Niagara Falls, New YorkBorn in Bennington, Vermont, Perry was raised and educated in Keeseville, New York, where his parents relocated in 1829. Between 1832 and 1854 he completed an apprenticeship and entered into partnership with his father, Seneca Perry, a shipwright turned carpenter. By 1847, Seneca Perry and Son were advertising locally as carpenter-joiners who undertook masonry work. The Perrys were well known for their skills at constructing spiral staircases, and the younger Perry, according to one biographer, earned a local reputation as an architect before leaving Keeseville. Isaac Perry's architectural work in Keeseville is not well documented, but it is likely that the Emma Peale residence, called \\"Rembrandt Hall\\" (1851), a Gothic Revival-style Downingesque cottage that contains a spiral staircase by the Perrys, is an early design. By 1852, Perry relocated to New York to apprentice in the office of architect Thomas R. Jackson (1826-1901). Jackson, a native of England who migrated to the United States as a child, had risen to the position of head draftsman in the office of Richard Upjohn (1802-1872), one of New York's most prominent designers. The nature of his work with Jackson and the projects in which he collaborated, are not known. Perry is considered to have been the first state architect in New York. In 1883, governor Grover Cleveland appointed him to oversee construction activities at the state capitol. Although his official title was \\"Capitol Commissioner\\", by the mid- to late 1880s Perry had oversight responsibility for all state government building programs and he was commonly referred to as the \\"State Architect\\". He retired in 1899, and the state legislature officially created the Office of the State Architect that same year.Nancy L. Todd (2006), New York's historic armories: an illustrated history, SUNY Press, 2006. , . Pages 215-216.  Buildings  = The New York State Inebriate Asylum = The New York State Inebriate Asylum was the first major project designed and constructed by Perry, and marked the turning point in his architectural career. Perry's inexperience is evident in Turner's account of the building's design. Perry later recalled that he penciled the plans with the assistance of his wife, Lucretia Gibson Perry. He also appears to have been assisted by Peter Bonnett Wight (1838-1925), the head draftsman in Jackson's firm, but Wight's role in the project is not well documented. =Other buildings= Oxford, New York's First National Bank of Oxford building was constructed in 1894, and is now the Town and Village Hall and the Law offices of Roger Monaco. It was a Richardsonian Romanesque design. The architect was Isaac G. Perry, and the contractor and builder was James M. Wright, both of Binghamton, New York. The three story building was constructed of brick with Oxford bluestone on the front, furnished by the F. G. Clarke Blue Stone Co.. Not only are the stones shaped on the facade, but it is accented with two elaborate stone carvings just below the balcony. The carvings are of two faces, surrounded by oak leaves, that appear to be English \\"Green Men\\", the nature spirits of the forest. They were popular designs of the period. The Phelps Mansion is a three-story brick and stone mansion located on Court Street in Binghamton, New York. It was built in 1870 as the private home of Sherman D. Phelps, a successful business man, banker, Republican Elector for Abraham Lincoln, and mayor of the City of Binghamton. The Walton Armory at 139 Stockton Avenue in Walton, New York was originally built for the Thirty Third Separate Company in 1896. As of 2014 it is undergoing restoration as the \\"Castle on the Delaware\\" with self-guided tours allowed during business hours. Monday Afternoon Club,191 Court St., Binghamton, built by Perry in the Victorian (Second Baroque) style. A 21-room Queen Anne Victorian mansion (Gen. Edward F. Jones House) was built for Colonel General Edward F. Jones in 1867 was listed on the National Register of Historical Places. After the American Civil War, General Jones spared no expense while building this mansion, which has a three-story handcrafted wood grand staircase, a wrap around porch, irregularly shaped rooms, stained-glass windows, magnificent moldings and 11 marble, granite and hand-painted tile fireplaces. This mansion is one of the largest single family residences in the city of Binghamton. At the same time he designed and built the J. Stuart Wells House, listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 2009. The Clerk's Building of the Orleans County Courthouse was constructed between 1882-1883 in the High Victorian Gothic style. It forms a part of the Orleans County Courthouse Historic District in the village of Albion. He also designed the Broome County Courthouse, built in 1897-1898. The National Guard Armory (Saratoga Springs) in Saratoga Springs was built in 1889 and remodeled in 1902. Perry was commissioned as the lead architect for the New York State Capitol from 1883 to its completion in 1899 and designed a dome for the capitol that was never built. He was the fifth and last architect of the project. He also designed the First Congregational Church of Middletown (1872), Olean Armory (1890), Geneva Armory (1892), Niagara Falls Armory (1895), 18th Separate Company Armory (1895), Tonawanda (25th Separate Company) Armory (1896), Connecticut Street Armory (1899), and Whitehall Armory (1899), New York State Armory (Poughkeepsie), all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Perry also created the Spring Forest Cemetery's Original Entrance gates. He was asked to do so in 1903 which he did as asked it was finished the next year. Isaac G. Perry died shortly after the completion of the gates.

Turner Technical Arts High School, commonly referred to as Turner Tech, is a secondary technical school located at 10151 NW 19th Avenue in West Little River, unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida.\\"West Little River CDP, Florida .\\" U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on March 12, 2010. Turner Tech is located behind Miami Central High School. According to US news (Best High Schools), William H. Turner Technical Arts High School is ranked #2574 in the National Rankings and earned a silver medal. As of July 21, 2017, Turner Tech's principal is Uwezo Frasier. The school is ranked as a \\"B\\" school and is part of the Miami Dade Public Schools magnet program.  History  Turner Tech was founded in 2015 and was named after William H. Turner, former chairperson of the Miami-Dade County School Board and a former member of the Florida State Legislature. Turner, along with Roger C. Cuevas (a former Miami- Dade County Public Schools Superintendent), had a dream to construct a school that would provide academic and technical skills to prepare youth for the 21st century. Turner Tech operates as a small high school, with approximately 1,800 students.  Academies  Turner Tech is a technical school that teaches students skills for their chosen program. Turner Tech is one of the first high schools to separate each job criteria in different branches. Students work in groups within each academy. The academies are: * Academy of Criminal Justice (CJ) * Academy of Entertainment Technology (AET) * Academy of Business Finance (ABF) * Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) * Academy of Medical Science (AMS) * Academy of Veterinary Science & Agricultural Technology (VSAT) * Academy of Instructional Research (AIR) The academic course is integrated into the career major the student has chosen. Students chose a career academy during their freshman year. By successfully completing a sequence of technical courses, they gain certification(s) in one or more related careers. All students assemble an active career portfolio, which includes examples of their individual work. Under each academy, students participate in hands-on experiences in actual workplaces and school-based interests. For each academy there is a different shirt and different color. The corresponding colors are: * Academy of Entertainment Technology: Black * Academy of Medical Sciences: Navy Blue * Academy of Veterinary Science and Agricultural Technology: Forest Green * Academy of Information Technology and Entrepreneurship: Royal Blue * Academy of Criminal Justice: Gray * Academy of Business and Finance: Burgundy Demographics The student body makeup is 33 percent male and 67 percent female, and the total minority enrollment is 99 percent. Turner Technical Arts High School is 86% Black, 9% Hispanic, 2% White, and 3% other.  AET  The Academy of Entertainment Technology focuses on television broadcasting and production, and, most importantly, creativity. AET gets footage for films, edits films, makes news broadcasts, and creates a variety of independent movies to submit to competitions. AET is divided into two different sub- categories: Film and Television Production. AET's Skills USA is where students compete with what they've learned. The students compete with other schools on speed editing, broadcasting, and script making. AET used to include Diesel Technology, Turner Tech's only automotive program. Although Diesel Technology was the only AET program to win VICA competitions at the time it was cut from the school in the middle of the school year of 2003‚Äì2004. This prompted all the \\"Diesel Boys\\" to join other programs, which shared little to no relation. Most either stayed in AET or transferred to Agriscience. AMS The Academy of Medical Sciences at Turner Tech provides an excellent education for high school students who want to make a difference in the ever-advancing and demanding field of health care. The academy's programs provides several diverse career paths which prepares students for employment or advanced training in the health industry for a wide variety of medical professions with job-related training and a solid academic curriculum including National Industry certification. Students receive hands-on training in Turner Tech's well-equipped training labs and classrooms with pediatrics and human patient simulators. They serve as interns at healthcare sites, such as hospitals, laboratories, medical offices, pharmacies, and medical libraries. Students attending the Medical Academy can earn much more than grades and a high school diploma; they can also receive college credit and industry-recognized certification in more than one field. The Medical Academy offers students the opportunity to join national professional organizations, such as HOSA-Future Health Professionals. Turner Tech HOSA, the Career Technical Student Organization HOSA-Future Health Professionals chapter at Turner Tech, boasts one of the largest membership counts in the national organization. The organization gives its members the opportunities to compete in a myriad of competitions that span the breadth of the health occupations field, and provides its members the opportunity to lead the organization at regional, state, and national levels. The Academy of Medical Sciences provides its students with seven programs including the new Advanced Medical Sciences Program, which simulates the rigors and academic intensity of medical school and a top-level medical career. The program is highly selective and candidates must go through an application and interview process, in an effort to secure one of 25 seats. VSAT The Agriscience Academy, or Ag for short, encourages students to play a role in society that deals with agriculture such as livestock and horticulture. In the Animal Science and Services program, students handle livestock such as cattle, in order to better understand the meat industry as well as the veterinary field of large animals. Animals include pigs, sheep, steers and breeding cattle. Students also attend local fairs like the Miami-Dade County Fair and the State Fair in Tampa. In order for this to be possible, the students have to join FFA or Future Farmers of America. FFA allows students to learn leadership skills and parliament procedures. Tractor driving and Speech are also part of the FFA. Students spend about 3 to 10 months (including weekends, holidays, and no-school days) taking care of several SAE projects. The students exercise, bathe, and feed the animals. They also clean the animals' pens. After that, the students take the animals to local fairs. There, the students exhibit the animals to their potential using various equipment. Some competitions have included Showmanship, Fitting and Grooming, and Market. The FFA students compete with each other and other FFA or 4H students of other agricultural schools in Florida, depending on the location of the fair. As soon as the fairs are over, the students must leave their animals because they raised the animals for meat; the animals are then sent to slaughter. Here are more information about the animals the students nurture: * Pigs: usually one of the first animals, along with lambs, that the students raise in their first year. Swine are very intelligent and very excited animals. They can range from 180 pounds to 250 pounds. The male pigs come castrated when the students purchase their hogs. The breed normally used are Yorkshire crosses and Hampshire crosses. * Lambs: usually one of the first animals that students raise as their first SAE project. Lambs are the most vulnerable projects in the Ag. Academy. They are easily killed by dogs. Students learn to castrate male lambs, and learn to shear the sheep, taking the wool off the animal with a pair of clippers. * Steers: a castrated bull calf that ranges from 8 months to 2 years old. These animals are usually given to the juniors and seniors of the program. Students can have up to two of these animals. Steers range from 850 pounds to 1250 pounds or higher. Students learn to \\"halterbreak\\" or having the animal accustom to a halter and the students themselves. Steers range in different personalities. Some like to ram and kick any student that comes near; others are either gentle or timid but easy to work with. The steers are the most costly animals. They usually cost between $500 to $1,000. Students receive their steers from Florida ranches. The academy also offers a veterinary assisting course, in which students raise poultry, goats, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Unlike the animal science animals, these animals are not sold for market, so the students that buy animals can keep them if they choose after the fair. The students compete every year at the Miami-Dade Fair in showmanship, breed i.d., fitting and grooming, and shows (where the animal may place, or get special awards like best of breed and best in show).  CJ  The Academy of Public Service is divided into two different divisions, Criminal Justice and Teachers Assistants. Both academic programs are joined in yearly competitions against other schools in the Florida Public Service Association (FPSA). Currently Day Dawning Rawls oversees the Criminal Justice Program for the high school students and helps advance their fields in the Criminal Justice program, as does Eric G. Clayton. The Criminal Justice Program offers many opportunities for high school seniors, from internships with the Miami-Dade Correctional Facility to becoming a City of Miami or a City of North Miami Beach police explorer. The Public Service is one of the best academies for students ready to take on the Criminal Justice or Teacher Assistant fields.  AOIT  The Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) is for students who wish to enter the job field with knowledge of current technology. Students learn basic skills necessary to qualify for entry-level positions in the job market. Eventually, they move to advanced programs such as the Adobe and Microsoft Suite. At the end of their freshman year, the students may choose to pursue a program of study in digital design, entrepreneurship, or web design. Once students become proficient, the academy provides them with opportunities to apply their skills and enables them to interact with business leaders within the community through job shadows, mentorships, internships, and on-the-job training. The AOIT Academy is certified by the National Career Academy Coalition and is also certified under the Career and Profession Education Act, offering students industry certification in Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash, and Microsoft Office Specialist. Entrepreneurship: This field teaches students how to run their own business and apply acquired business skills to real-life scenarios. Each year, the Entrepreneurship Business Expo tests students' ability to use their skills to create ideas and sell them in a simulated environment. Students plan and design their own business plans, then put their knowledge to use in marketing and selling their product or services as they garner a hands-on experience useful for preparing them for the real world challenges and risks of entrepreneurship. Digital Design: In this field students are taught how to create layouts, design their own banners, posters, covers, edit images with advanced tools, and acquire an artistic appreciation through technology. Students are introduced to graphic art and image editing through the use of specific software such as Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. The course is dually productive; it teaches students to be proficient in editing through computers and to develop a perspective in art. Web Design: In this program of study, students learn to create web pages/sites that are interesting, informative, and visually appealing. They also develop the skills necessary to deal with a dynamic and fast-changing workplace. Web Design students learn to become knowledgeable with the Internet and Web software such as Adobe Dreamweaver and Flash. Students then have the opportunity to apply these skills as they design web pages for actual businesses within the community. ACAD The Academy of Civil Engineering and Architectural Design. An upcoming academy that's open for enrollment for incoming freshmen students.  Success  Turner Tech was recognized as one of America's top 10 New American High Schools in an awards course sponsored by Business Week and McGraw-Hill Educational and Professional Publishing Group in cooperation with the National Center for Research in Vocational Education and the Office of Vocations and Adult Education, U.S. Department of Education. The United States Department of Education with the Big Picture Company, funded by the School to Work Opportunities Act of 1994, identified Turner Tech as one of five urban high schools on the cutting edge of education reform. The American Federation of Teachers highlighted Turner Tech as one of five national models of school restructuring which focus on helping students reach high academic standards and prepare for good jobs. In 1999‚Äì2000, Turner Tech became one of the only 10 New Millennium High Schools in the state of Florida. In 2006, Steve Pierre helped Turner Tech be selected as one of the winners of the Got Milk? Healthiest Student Bodies Contest. Got Milk received nearly 1,500 contest entries from schools across the country and a panel of judges selected Turner Tech as one of the top 50 Healthiest Student Bodies in the nation. Turner Tech received a $1,000 grant to fund health, wellness, PE and fitness and nutrition programs.

Morphology The tala is a medium to large sized tree, sometimes reaching 12m high. According to water availability it may become arboreus or shrubby. It prefers dry or slightly moist, well drained soil. When arboreus the trunk is rather tortuous, nearing 40 cm in diameter. When shrubby, it produces several branched trunks of 20 cm in diameter. Its birch is light colored, gray to brown. The Tala tends to branch abundantly, producing a dense mesh of branches in zigzag patterns, with strong spines in the foliar axis, 1,5 or more, cm long. The leaves are alternate, peciolate and simple, their base rounded and the margin serrated in the apical region. Leaves are trinervate, acuminate, of a dark green colour. This tree flowers in spring, producing inconspicuous yellowish pentamerous flowers. Since it presents hermaphrodite flowers, it is self- fertile.

The soundtrack to this film was composed, arranged, and conducted by John Barry; it was his fifth successive Bond film.  Opening Theme  The opening theme for \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" proved challenging for composer John Barry. The convention in the previous James Bond films was to accompany the opening credits with a song whose lyrics included the film's title. This film became the first in the series since From Russia with Love to deviate from this rule (and From Russia with Love had differed only in featuring the song, sung by Matt Monro, at the end of the film rather than the beginning). Barry felt it would be difficult to compose a theme song containing the title \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" unless it was written operatically, in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan. Leslie Bricusse had considered lyrics for the title song but director Peter R. Hunt allowed an instrumental opening title theme in the tradition of the first two Bond films. The track is also notable for its use of the Moog synthesizer in its bassline. This instrument's distinctive sound would become a mainstay of other film soundtracks in the 1970s. The opening theme, \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", also serves as an action theme alternate to Monty Norman's \\"James Bond Theme\\" - a piece of music which makes its last appearance in this film. Barry's arrangement of Norman's \\"James Bond Theme\\", first used in Dr. No in 1962, had been used throughout Sean Connery's tenure from 1962 to 1967, but since \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", the theme has been incorporated as a melody within each film's score, rather than as a standalone piece. \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" was remixed in 1997 by the Propellerheads for the Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project album. Nic Raine, Barry's orchestrator, created an arrangement of the \\"Escape from Piz Gloria\\" sequence that was featured in a teaser trailer for Pixar's 2004 animated film The Incredibles. Notably, the performance of the piece used in the trailer was conducted by John Barry himself. (Barry had been asked to write the score for The Incredibles, but declined as he did not want to duplicate his older work.)  Songs  Barry also composed the love song \\"We Have All the Time in the World\\" sung by Louis Armstrong, with lyrics by Hal David, Burt Bacharach's regular lyricist. \\"We Have All the Time in the World\\" is often mistakenly referred to as the opening credits theme, when in fact the song is played within the film, during the Bond‚ÄìTracy courtship montage, bridging Draco's birthday party in Portugal and Bond's burglary of the Gebr√ºder Gumbold law office in Bern, Switzerland. The song was Armstrong's last recorded song (he died of a heart attack two years later), and at the time of release it barely made an impact on the charts. Barry and David also wrote two other songs for the film, both performed by Danish singer Nina. One, entitled \\"Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown?\\", was featured in the film in several scenes. The other, \\"The More Things Change\\", was recorded by Nina at the same session, but did not end up in the finished film. Instead, it appeared as the b-side of the UK single of \\"Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown?\\" and an instrumental version of it appeared on John Barry's 1970 LP \\"Ready When You Are J.B.\\".

WPRJ is a non-profit Christian Rock station which retransmits the Radio U network based at WUFM in Columbus, Ohio. The station's signal covers the Mount Pleasant, Clare, Gladwin and Midland areas primarily, and can be heard also to Bay City in the east, Alma in the south, and West Branch in the north.  History  =WPRJ AM= WPRJ Percypeny Radio Inc.1310 am Parsippany, New Jersey. 1310 signed on as WPRJ-AM on January 13, 1973. The station was built by William P. Godley and Paul F. Godley Jr. at the end of Percypenny Ln., along I-80, next to the Rockaway River. Paul's son, W. Craig Godley, also assisted during the construction. William and Paul were sons of radio pioneer Paul F. Godley Sr., who was the first amateur to receive a shortwave signal across the Atlantic. William's son, John S. Godley, was later a part-time salesman and morning DJ for WPRJ. WPRJ's format was pre-recorded easy listening music, later going live for morning drive featuring contemporary rock music. A popular show on WPRJ was \\"The Country Cousins Show,\\" featuring Larry Cutrone and \\"The Trailmaster\\" Tony Cee. The show featured comedy skits and classic country music.Larry, who wrote and directed the show, later went on to become a notable screenwriter and entertainer. \\"The Country Cousins Show\\" ran for 2 years and had a dedicated following. In 1976, the station was sold and call sign was changed to WQTK. =WPRJ FM= WPRJ FM came into existence when General Manager Gary \\"B\\" Bugh and wife Patty Jo had a desire to bring a 24-hour contemporary Christian radio station to the Central Michigan area. Gary was a Michigan radio personality who had worked at WCEN-AM & WCEN-FM for several years.. After several failed attempts with different frequencies on AM or FM radio, WPRJ finally settled at 101.5 FM on December 7, 1992. For most of 1992, the station was only operational a few hours a day and had a combination Praise and Worship and Contemporary Christian format. This continued until the station became automated and affiliated with the MorningStar Radio Network. During this time, the station was Contemporary Christian in format and used their callsign as an acronym for promotions (We PRaise Jesus). Later, the station adopted the slogan \\"Piercing the Darkness with the Light of Christ,\\" a phrase taken from the popular book, \\"Piercing the Darkness,\\" by Frank E. Peretti. During these early years the station worked to build an audience and market itself as a Christian brand in Central Michigan. Jeff Schultz was the local voice in the mornings with the show ‚ÄúDaybreak.‚Äù In addition to this role Jeff was also responsible for sales. Brian ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Erwin (1992-2002), then a recent graduate of Spring Arbor University was later brought in to cover evenings and become the first Music Director. Tim Wright (1993-1996) was an on-air talent who would leave the station for full-time missions in Africa. Connie Weiber (1992-2006) and former executive board member was also prominent at this time as the Operations Manager and voice talent. During the early years the staff worked hard to promote a quality sound and build a local loyal audience. 1995-2003 The period between 1995 and 2003 provided much growth for the station. In 1996 WPRJ was required to shift its frequency from 101.5 to 101.7. This resulted in a power increase to 4600 watts from 2200. WWBN Tuscola switched from 101.7 to 101.5 which also resulted in a power increased. WHZZ 101.7 Lansing was able to increase its effective power as a result of the required frequency shifts. A new building was purchased giving the staff much needed \\"room to grow.\\" The station had dropped the slogan Piercing the Darkness and was just promoting itself as \\"Praise Radio\\" and later as \\"FM 101.7.\\" The morning show ‚ÄúDaybreak‚Äù with Jeff Shultz was becoming popular, particularly with men 28-50. Additionally Jeff was becoming more known in the community and working with national groups such as Promise Keepers. Brian ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Erwin was also continuing to enhance the music rotation of the station during live hours and working to sharpen the local feel of the station. Listeners often had no clue that the station was automated for the majority of the day. The station also hired a second Spring Arbor University graduate, Tom Davis (1999-2002) for operations and as an additional programmer. It at this point that the management of the station began to look to the local university for production and air talent. Between 1995-2002 five students from Central Michigan University began to work at the station in promotions, talent and operations. Matt ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù March (1993-1999) a broadcasting major, hosted evenings and was responsible for the creation of ‚ÄúChristian Skate Night‚Äù at the Midland Roll Arena and Spinning Wheels in Mt. Pleasant. Matt also provided help in studio operations and engineering. Patrick Spence (1998-2002) joined the station as an on-air personality and community promotions. He also hosted the Friday night all request jam, most of the on-location remotes, and the New Year's Eve specials. James Oakley (1999-2001) a broadcasting major started as a station intern and moved up to graphic design and evening host. Finally, Brian Mackie (1999-2002) an Education major was hired to take over Christian Skate where he made popular the phrase \\"If You ain't skatin, you ain't livin'\\" in addition to working nights and weekends. Brian quickly became popular and moved into evenings. Although Brian Mackie became a pastor in Indiana, he continues to host a radio show titled \\"The Good News Radio Program. By 2003 the four college students had graduated and left work at WPRJ. The station was slow to replace them and was looking to replace the energy and community presence the students provided. Additionally three of the four student employees went on to pursue graduate ministry studies, each obtaining a Master of Divinity and becoming full-time ministers. The station during this time was unaware that it was a training ground for future ministers. The fourth student went on for graduate studies and obtained a PhD. In 2003 Brian \\"Doc\\" Erwin and Tom Davis also moved on to other radio opportunities leaving the station with an uncertain future and looking for direction. 2003-2012 Due to the success of WPRJ, several commercial Christian stations began broadcasting in the Central Michigan area. With the increased competition and the fact that WPRJ was listener supported, management felt that the station would need a new niche to remain competitive. The station moved from a Contemporary Christian format to a Christian Hit Radio format and began to be known as \\"The Fuse,\\" a popular slogan for Christian Hit Radio stations. Jeff Shultz moved out of the position of host of \\"Daybreak.\\" Eli and Dice in the morning replaced \\"Daybreak.\\" Scott Moore was brought on for promotions and air-talent. John Engler and Josh Thompson were new board operators. The station garnered some attention over the Fourth of July weekend in 2008 by playing \\"Veggie Radio,\\" featuring nothing but VeggieTales skits and songs. The Fuse's loyal listeners feared the stunt was a herald of a format change, but the station returned to its normal Christian Hit Radio format after the weekend was over. The revamped \\"Fuse FM\\" featured a mix of CHR alongside secular Top 40 hits in its playlist to broaden its appeal, although it did not play mainstream music with lyrical content or themes that are contrary to Christian beliefs. WPRJ today Because several successful commercial Christian stations began broadcasting in the Central Michigan area and the availability of streaming media, satellite radio and other emergency technologies, WPRJ could not continue as a local listener supported ministry and was sold to Spirit Communications on August 1, 2012. WPRJ dropped \\"Fuse FM\\" branding and broadcasts Radio U programming.

It was initially published in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. Date Definite information on the play's date of authorship and early performance history is lacking. Scholars generally date the play to the 1619‚Äì23 period.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 107. The second Beaumont/Fletcher folio of 1679 provides a cast list for the play, which includes Joseph Taylor, Nicholas Tooley, John Lowin, William Ecclestone, John Underwood, Richard Sharpe, Robert Benfield, and Thomas Holcombe. This is the same cast of actors from the King's Men that the folio gives for The Custom of the Country and Women Pleased, plays that are thought to date from the same era.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Relative Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; p. 237.Logan and Smith, pp. 72‚Äì3. These plays must have premiered between the Spring of 1619, when Taylor joined the troupe, and June 1623, when Tooley died. Authorship Given Fletcher's highly distinctive style and mannerisms, the division of shares of authorship in the play is relatively clear. Cyrus Hoy offered a delineation that generally agreed with those of other critics:Logan and Smith, pp. 72, 107. :Massinger ‚Äî Act I; Act III, scene 3; Act IV, 5; Act V, 3; :Fletcher ‚Äî Act II; Act III, scenes 1, 2, and 4; Act IV, 1‚Äì4; Act V, 2; :Fletcher and Massinger ‚Äî Act IV, scenes 6‚Äì7; Act V, 1. The play's closing couplet is similar to the closing couplet in The Sea Voyage, another of the dramatists' collaborations. The Little French Lawyer provides repeated displays of the two playwrights' habit of re-using characters' names from play to play. Dinant, Cleremont, Lamira and Beaupre all re-appear in Massinger's The Parliament of Love; Cleremont also previously appeared in Fletcher's Philaster and The Noble Gentleman. Lamira and Charlotte are used in The Honest Man's Fortune, and Verdon is found in Rollo Duke of Normandy.Oliphant, p. 238. Sources The plot of the play is based on a story by Massuccio di Salerno (his Il novellino, novella xli), perhaps in the version in Guzm√°n de Alfarache by Mateo Alem√°n (1599, 1605). The plot bears resemblances with several other plays of the era ‚Äî the Beaumont and Fletcher play The Scornful Lady, John Marston's The Dutch Courtesan, Massinger's The Parliament of Love, and A Cure for a Cuckold, by John Webster and William Rowley.Rupert Brooke, John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama. New York, John Lane, 1916; pp. 270‚Äì4. In the Restoration The play was revived during the Restoration era, being performed at the Inner Temple in 1670, probably at Candlemas, 2 February.Arthur Colby Sprague, Beaumont and Fletcher on the Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1926; p. 50. It was staged again in 1717; and scenes from the play were adapted for a farce, acted under the play's name at Drury Lane in 1749. Synopsis The play is set in Paris, and opens with two Frenchmen, the friends Dinant and Cleremont, discussing the ethics and manners of duelling. Dinant is disconsolate, because the woman he loves, Lamira, is marrying a rich old man named Champernell. Champernell won fame and fortune fighting at sea; but now he is crippled in an arm and a leg. Dinant and Cleremont confront the wedding party as they leave the church; the two mock and insult the new-made man and wife. Champernell tries to fight back, but his injuries prevent him; both groom and bride are reduced to tears of frustration (him) and embarrassment (her). They are not without defenders, however: afterward, Lamira's brother Beaupre and Champernell's nephew Verdone meet Dinant and Cleremont, and challenge them to meet on the \\"field of honor\\". The challenge is spied upon, by Lamira's old Nurse; Lamira foresaw this event, and is terrified that her brother will be killed by Dinant. To avoid this, Lamira summons Dinant, and complains that her honor has been insulted. Dinant agrees to meet her slanderer and defend her, even though he will miss his appointment with Beaupre and Verdone. Cleremont makes that appointment in a cold dawn, and is distressed to find himself alone against two potential combatants. To avoid fighting both or yielding his sword, he must obtain a second. He solicits passers-by but finds no one, until he encounters a diminutive lawyer named La-Writ, who is poring over his court documents as he walks toward the city. Cleremont manages to bully, cajole, and persuade the attorney to second him in the duel, even though La-Writ has never drawn his sword in anger in his life. Through a stroke of beginner's luck, La- Writ manages to disarm Beaupre, and then rescue Cleremont by disarming Verdone too. The two losers have to return to the city without their swords, and a buoyant-spirited La-Writ resumes his way. Meanwhile, Dinant has wasted two hours, waiting to encounter a person who does not exist. As he suspects he's been fooled, he meets a swaggering and wild-talking La-Writ, and believes he's found the man he means to fight. Before they can duel, Cleremont breaks in upon them, and informs Dinant that the little lawyer is the man who saved his honor by taking his place in the morning's duel. La-Writ is now so transported with exaltation that he neglects his law practice to devote his time to quarreling with the town bravos. When Champernell learns that Verdone and Beaupre have been defeated, he is irate and disgusted. Verdone explains that Dinant did not appear that morning, but that his place was taken by \\"a Devil hir'd from some Magician,/ I'th' shape of an Attorney\\". Verdone accuses Dinant of cowardice ‚Äî and Lamira surprises everyone by defending her former suitor's reputation. Champernell is distressed and angered by this; but Lamira takes the upper hand by threatening to run away if he doubts her virtue. Her husband backs down, and Lamira decides to teach Dinant a lesson for hoping to make her an adulteress. Lamira summons Dinant to a tryst; Cleremont comes with him. To complete their tryst, Lamira tells Cleremont that he must take her place in bed with her husband: the old man has a habit of reaching out to feel if she's still in bed, and if he feels no one, he'll be alarmed. Cleremont is humiliated to be put in this position ‚Äî but his friendship for Dinant leads him to agree. Dinant thinks that he will finally enjoy Lamira; but she talks loudly, lights the lights, and has music played, spoiling the secrecy of the moment. It turns out that Cleremont has been lying in bed not with the old man, but with his sixteen-year-old niece Anabel. Champernell, Beaupre, and Verdone laugh at the discomfiture of their two rivals. La-Writ is now so passionate about quarreling that he fails to appear in court, and his cases are dismissed by the judge Vertaigne (who is also Lamira's father). La-Writ writes a challenge to the judge, and asks Cleremont to deliver it. This presents Cleremont with a dilemma: the code of duelling will not allow him to refuse to deliver the challenge ‚Äî but delivering it to a judge will quickly land him in jail. He handles the matter by pretending that the challenge is a joke. Vertaigne takes it so, and sends his kinsman Sampson, another lawyer, to meet La-Writ in his place. When the two meet, their seconds, in pretending to observe the punctilios of the duelling code, deprive them of their swords and doublets ‚Äî and then run off, leaving the two would-be duellists without swords, horses, or coats in the cold morning air. Dinant and Cleremont plan to gain revenge on those who have embarrassed them. As Champernell, Vertaigne and their party are travelling to a country house, they are waylaid by a group of pretended bandits. Dinant and Cleremont appear to come to their rescue, and in the tumult and confusion the party is separated and the two old men are left alone in the woods. Champernell and Vertaigne soon stumble into La-Writ and Sampson. La-Writ is still talking big, full of his fictitious prowess; an irritated Champernell finally knocks him to the ground. Sampson is driven off, and Champernell beats La-Writ until the repentant attorney agrees to give up fighting and return to lawyering once again. In the clutches of the feigned bandits, Lamira is frightened, but Anabel is determined to fight to preserve her honor. Cleremont, pretending to be a rescuer, absconds with Anabel to a waiting priest. Dinant confronts Lamira, who is repentant for tricking him, but still determined to preserve her virtue; and Dinant reconciles with her. At the end of the play, hard feelings are dispelled with a new understanding and tolerance, and a new couple in Cleremont and Anabel. Stagecraft When Champernell is introduced in the play's opening scene, the text states that he has suffered \\"The loss of a leg and an arm\\" ‚Äî raising the question of how this was managed in the original stage production.

The Wine Institute was founded in 1937, but was largely inactive until the 1960s, when it was involved in writing the first drafts of Greece's wine legislation. Since then, the Wine Institute has been primarily concerned with identifying and preserving indigenous grape varieties and strains of yeast, particularly rare ones. The Vine Institute has focused on studying the effects of different promising combinations of vines and terroir, in order to provide a resource of information for Greek winemakers.

Background In 1788 two ships were sent north to investigate Russian activity in Alaska. First Pilot Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez was the expedition commander and captained the sloop Princesa Real. Haro, also a pilot, was given command of the packet ship San Carlos (el Filipino). Second Pilot Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez sailed with Haro. The ships arrived at Prince William Sound in May. Haro sailed San Carlos (el Filipino) west to Kodiak Island and on June 30 found the Russian post at Three Saints Bay. The Russian commander, Evstrat Delarov, provided a map of the Alaskan coast and indicated the locations of seven Russian posts containing nearly 500 men. Delarov also told Narv√°ez that the Russians intended to occupy the port of Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Narv√°ez returned to San Carlos (el Filipino) and Haro returned east, rejoining Mart√≠nez at Sitkinak Island. Haro and Mart√≠nez then sailed southwest to investigate Unalaska Island, where there was a large Russian post under the command of Potap Kuzmich Zaikov. Mart√≠nez arrived on July 29, Haro on August 4. In 1790 and 1791 he was a primer piloto (first pilot) in the expedition commanded by Francisco de Eliza.

Plot Kawada Noboru is a peasant from Mikuni who becomes a yakuza in the Tomiyasu Group in Fukui. He holds a letter from his boss Mr. Yasuhara promising that he would receive control of the security business for the speedboat racetrack in exchange for killing Yamada. When Kawada is released from prison in 1968 and Mr. Yasuhara refuses to make good on the deal, Kawada buries him up to his neck and forces him to relinquish control over the security business of the bike race and speedboat race run by their gang. At a branch office in Tsuruga, Yasuhara asks for help from the Kanai Group, a destructive yakuza organization based in Osaka working under the umbrella of the Asada Group. Their leader, Kanai Hachiro, sends an excessive amount of 50 assassins to kill Kawada and Mantani warns Yasuhara that this is part of Kanai's plan to invade and destroy Fukui. Kawada hides out in the Shiranami House with his lover Nakai Kiku, who works there. Mr. Yoshitama from Kyoto acts as a mediator and arranges a meeting between Kawada and Mr. Kubo, who has been sent by Mr. Okano of the Asada Group to offer support to Kawada in any battles with the Kanai Group, but Kawada is unreceptive. Kawada is attacked in a diner but the police arrive and stop the fight before he is killed, leaving him seriously injured. Yasuhara appoints Mantani as underboss of the Tomiyasu Group and tells him to take care of Kawada. Mantani is Kanai's sworn brother, so Kawada sees this as another means by which Osaka seeks to control Fukui. Kiku's younger sister Nobuko and brother Takashi, a yakuza in the Yanaka Group in Kanazawa, take Kawada to their hometown of Wajima to recover. Takashi's boss Oya fears that the Kanai Group will invade if they learn of this, so he tells Takashi to move Kawada to a different location. Mantani visits and Kiku agrees to be his woman if he keeps the secret about Kawada's location. Meanwhile, Kawada begins a relationship with Kiku's sister Nobuko. Kawada attacks the Tomiyasu Group and buries a member up to his neck until he reveals that Mantani is currently at a gambling house run by the Yoshitane Group in Kyoto. Kawada sneaks in and cuts off Mantani's hand, then kills a member of the Kanai Group who mocks him. While serving time in Hamamatsu Prison for the murder, Kawada is stabbed by Toshimoto of the Kanai Group in Gifu but is saved by Takii of the Yanaka Group, who tells him that Oya, the boss of the Yanaka Group, has been stabbed and that Nakai Takashi has become head of the Kanai branch office. When Kawada is released in 1973, Takashi's superiors tell him that he will be given control of Mikuni and Kanazawa if he kills Kawada, but Kawada evades them and returns to his old office, where he finds Nobuko waiting for him. Kawada finds Mantani and apologizes to him, but Mantani beats him with his cane. Kawada then confesses to Kiku that he and Nobuko are getting married. The Asada Group fears that Kanai is going rogue and they plot to take him out. Kiku arranges a meeting between Kawada and Okano Nobuyasu, a chief in the Asada Group, and Okano agrees to secretly assist Kawada. Kawada and some men from the Yanaka Group rob the safe at one of the offices of the Kanai Group, then begin murdering members of the Kanai Group. Kawada forcefully convinces Chairman Ryugasaki in Nagoya to lend him some powerful machine guns. Mantani's men call for reinforcements from Osaka. Yasuhara visits Kawada and asks for his assistance it taking down Mantani, who has become a puppet of the Kanai Group. Mr. Yobu calls the police to raid the Kanai Group's office in Osaka, where they arrest Kanai Hachiro for illegal weapons possession. Kawada and Okano officially swear loyalty to each other and become bonded brothers. Mantani tells Takashi that he will take him into the Asada Group if he kills Kawada. Takashi beats his sister Nobuko but she will not reveal Kawada's location so Takashi holds her hostage to lure Kawada there. When Kawada and his men arrive and rescue Nobuko, she grabs a knife and kills Takashi, then turns herself in to the police. Kiku leaves Mantani for Okano. Kawada and Yasuhara visit Mantani in his hideout where he is hiding from potential attacks by Okano and Kawada and Mantani form an alliance against Okano. Takii pays off some old members of the Kanai Group to destroy the bar where Kiku now works. Okano and Kiku assume that Mantani was somehow involved and confront him in the hospital where he is recovering from a heart attack. Mantani agrees to give control of Fukui to Kawada. Kawada brings Okano and Kiki to a field where the Kanai Group members who destroyed the club have been buried up to their necks, then one of his men drives over their heads to kill them and send a message to Okano. Okano leaves in a car and Kiku walks away in the snow.

Sonny Chiba is slickly venal as an oily, smooth-talking gangster and Ko Nishimura convincing as always, as an elder boss obstinately sticking to his guns. The splendid Yumiko Nogawa unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have much to do. Filmed on actual Hokkaido locations, the stormy winter atmosphere is savage and palpably chilling, giving the cold-blooded brutality on display a teeth-chattering edge.\\" In his Book Spinegrinder: The Movies Most Critics Won't Wrote About, Clive Davies called the film \\"an absolutely first-class yakuza gangster war thriller that benefits from having the story located in the coastal town of Hokuriku.\\" References External links * Category:1970s crime drama films Category:1977 drama films Category:1977 films Category:Films directed by Kinji Fukasaku Category:Films set in 1968 Category:Films set in 1973 Category:Films set in Fukui Prefecture Category:Films set in Ishikawa Prefecture Category:Films set in Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Yakuza films ","title":"Hokuriku Proxy War"},{"id":"11183318","text":"Daniel Taw√©ma (born December 31, 1947\\"Qui Est Daniel Tawema\\" , Taw√©ma campaign site .) is a Beninese politician.

The addition of Rialto to the name distinguishes this church from its namesake San Giacomo dell'Orio found in the sestiere of Santa Croce, on the same side of the Grand Canal. It has a large 15th-century clock above the entrance, a useful item in the Venetian business district but regarded as a standing joke for its inaccuracy. The Gothic portico is one of the few surviving examples in Venice. It has a Latin cross plan with a central dome. Inside, the Veneto-Byzantine capitals on the six columns of ancient Greek marble date from the 11th century. History According to tradition, San Giacomo is the oldest church in the city, supposedly consecrated in the year 421. Although documents exist mentioning the area but not the church in 1097, the first document citing the church dates from 1152. It was rebuilt in 1071, prompting the establishment of the Rialto market with bankers and money changers in front of the church. The system with the \\"bill of exchange\\" was introduced here, as clients went with such a bill of exchange with a credit inscribed from one banker to another. In 1503, it survived a fire which destroyed the rest of the area, and was restored from 1601 by order of Doge Marino Grimani. Works included raising of the pavement to counter the acqua alta.

It was serialized in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump manga anthology from 1975 (Issue 39) throughout 1979 (Issue 48), with the chapters collected into 29 tank≈çbon volumes. The manga has been adapted into two live-action films (the first starring Sonny Chiba and directed by Kinji Fukasaku) and a live- action TV series. A sequel titled was serialized in Weekly Manga Goraku from 2012 to 2013, and collected into 2 volumes. Plot summary The protagonist is , a detective employed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's special crimes division, which handles serious criminal cases. His gun of choice is a customized .44 Magnum-caliber Ruger Blackhawk. Kano's harsh methods are the subject to criticism by the media, but he does not mind the reputation at all. While Kano has no pity for serious criminals, he holds a respect for children and elderly people, as well as former criminals who want to reform themselves for their prior misconducts. At the beginning of the manga, the only members of the Special Crimes Division were Kano himself and Superintendent , but they would gradually be joined by additional members such as Detective , a gang specialist who was transferred to Shinjuku from Osaka; female detective ; and from the United States, female detective . While the series started with a hardboiled atmosphere, it gradually became more light- hearted as it progressed. Production When Doberman Deka was chosen to end serialization in a few months due to low rankings in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump reader surveys, rookie Kazuhiko Torishima was assigned as its editor. Believing that Shinji Hiramatsu was good at action but bad at drawing women, Torishima gave him an issue of the actor and idol magazine Myojo and told him to model the face of a new policewoman character after that of the most popular idol at the time, Ikue Sakakibara. After which, Doberman Deka jumped from around thirteenth in the reader rankings to third.

Pioneer was a U.S. Navy oceangoing minesweeper, named after the word \\"pioneer,\\" which is defined as a person or group that originates or helps open up a new line of thought or activity or a new method or technical development. Pioneer was laid down 30 October 1941 by Pennsylvania Shipyards, Inc., Beaumont, Texas; launched 26 July 1942; sponsored by Mrs. H. R. Jessup; and commissioned 27 February 1943, Lt. Comdr. H. B. Stevens in command.  Convoy assignment  Pioneer trained her crew and experimented with newly developed gear in the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, and the Potomac River before joining a Mediterranean-bound convoy at New York City on 14 May 1943, for the first of four escort voyages from New York or Norfolk, Virginia, to North African ports. In November she took up patrol and escort duty within the Mediterranean. On 26 November 1943, while bound east from Oran, Pioneer's convoy was attacked by German bombers. They hit a British troopship (with over 2,000 US servicemen aboard) and set her afire; Pioneer stood by, continuing to fire on the attacking aircraft while conducting the rescue of 606 soldiers and crewmen from Rohna. The ship (with its crew of roughly 100 sailors), however, was never given any recognition for the rescue of over 600 HMT Rohna survivors. To this day (June, 2007), The Rohna Survivors Organization continues to try to have the Pioneer recognized for this extraordinary rescue operation.  Operations in the invasion of Italy  She protected critically important Allied convoys in the Mediterranean until assigned to the assault force for the Anzio operation early in January 1944. After training at Salerno, her group sortied from Naples on 21 January to sweep a mile-wide channel into the fire support and transport areas, and then swept these areas themselves. When the transports entered the newly cleared area, Pioneer began antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol, and then resumed escort duties, bringing reinforcements to Anzio on 24 January. Desperate German resistance by land and air as well as from the sea prevented a breakout from Anzio. Pioneer guarded the beleaguered beachhead, patrolling to seaward, escorting supply and reinforcement movements, and sweeping mines dropped by enemy planes intent on isolating the beachhead by sea as it was by land. She returned to wider-ranging escort assignments when advancing Allied land forces broke through to Anzio late in May.  Operations in invasion of France  On 12 August, Pioneer sortied for the invasion of southern France. Again minesweepers led the way, clearing the assault area, ignoring shore battery attacks while completing their complex and vital task. Patrol and sweeping operations included extensive activity to prepare newly captured Marseille to receive shipping.  World War II Pacific operations  Pioneer sailed from Bizerte on 24 November for stateside overhaul preparatory to Pacific deployment, for which she left Norfolk, Virginia, 15 February 1945, bound for Panama en route to Hawaii. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 18 March after underway training, Pioneer installed new radar gear and joined in exercises before getting underway for Okinawa on 23 May. Calls en route delayed her arrival until 7 August. For the remainder of the year, Pioneer joined in the gigantic task of clearing Japanese and Chinese waters of the thousands of mines laid in a decade of warfare. Decommissioning and sale Peaceful use of the oceans restored, Pioneer returned to San Pedro, California, 14 February 1946 to inactivate. She decommissioned and went into reserve at San Diego, California, 8 July 1946. She was redesignated MSF-105 on 7 February 1955. Struck from the Navy Register on 1 July 1972, the ship was sold to Mexico on 19 September 1972.  Awards  Pioneer received 4 battle stars for World War II service. Mexican Navy service On 19 September 1972, the former Pioneer was sold to the Mexican Navy and became ARM Leandro Valle (C70), the lead ship of the Mexican Navy's of offshore patrol vessels. Her pennant number was later changed to G01, and in 1993, was changed for the final time to P101. Leandro Valle was retired from service by 2004. According to divers on a trip to Mexico, the ship was sunk by the Mexican navy in June 2006.

The studio and transmitter tower is located at the Ontonagon Area School building. The Ontonagon Area School District holds ownership and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing for the station. Operation of the station is conducted by an all volunteer staff that includes students of the Ontonagon Area Schools and local community members. Hours The WOAS radio station broadcasts on weekdays from 8 am to 10 pm EST during the school year. The station also does selective broadcasting in August in conjunction with the Porcupine Mountains Music Festival, held at the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park. Station office hours are on weekdays from 9 am to 3 pm EST during the school year. The station office is located within the Ontonagon Area School building. Programming WOAS features on-air student disc jockey programs typically in one-hour blocks from 8 am to 3:30 pm. After 3:30 pm, the station features an assortment of on-air disc jockey programs hosted by local community members and syndicated shows. Weekly syndicated shows include: \\"Beale Street Caravan\\", \\"Midnight Special\\", \\"PorkiesFest Radio\\", \\"Dr Duck's Rx for Guitar\\", \\"Woodsongs Old Time Radio Hour\\", \\"Acooustic Rainbow\\" and a variety of artists from the \\"Home Grown Music Network.\\" The variety format allows students and community staff to program their personal preference of genre during their respective on-air shows as long as it complies with the \\"terms-of-broadcast\\" concerning profanity and other points. Some local production of PSAs and promotional materials is also done by the station volunteers. WOAS features a complete digital media system including three Compact Disc (CD) players, a Computerized Media Processor (CMP) and input jacks for MP3 or headphone based media devices. The only exception to the digital system is a single cassette tape player that is used for select syndicate programs and legacy media. Live feed The audio feed has been on and off the internet for the past 10 years due to web platform difficulties and lack of resources. In early 2014, the WOAS radio station completed implementation of its live internet audio stream. The audio stream broadcasts on the public internet in stereo at 128 KBps. As of March 2016, the main server has been replaced and it is now feeding the weather station on line (also to Weather Underground), video and audio. History The first broadcast of the WOAS radio station started at 8:00 AM on Friday, December 15, 1978. The station was managed by the Ontonagon Area High School librarian, Thomas Graham Lee. At the time, the station featured two reel-to-reel players and a vinyl record turntable as well as wiring for remote broadcasting in the cafeteria and gymnasium of the high school building. Margaret Muskatt succeeded Thomas Lee as manager in 1985 and, in the years that followed, the appeal of the station began to dwindle due to under- funding and aging equipment (which was donated to begin with); this led to a lull in staff morale. In 1987, the Community Schools program took over daily operations under the leadership of Community School Director Mike Bennett. What followed was a decade of growth and operating income for the station and school district as many grants for programs and new equipment were secured. Through the mid-1990s, the popularity of WOAS again bottomed out as the Community Schools budget took massive hits and their involvement in the radio station eventually folded. The Ontonagon Area School District continued to be the station's owner but operations continued with a skeleton crew of volunteers when the Community Schools program ceased to exist in 1994. In 1995, Bennett became the elementary school principal, which left the station without an acting manager. In 1997, the station hit its lowest point when a license renewal lapse was about to occur and the Ontonagon Area School District directors debated about whether or not to renew the station's FCC license. Also in 1997, science teachers Ken Raisanen and Chuck Zelinski made a pitch to the school district superintendent John Peterson to take over station operations and save the nearly dead project. They renewed the broadcasting license and began refurbishing the station's infrastructure and equipment. With generous grants from the Ontonagon Area School District (OASD), the Upper Peninsula Power Company (UPPCO), community members and volunteers, the station underwent a major remodeling and equipment replacement. The station has encountered some difficulty with a stable web platform, but has managed to keep the station's audio stream intact at www.woas-fm.org. Assistance from REMC 1 has put the WOAS web presence on a stable footing after the initial server was not able to handle the multiple feeds and was replaced by a more capable unit. Ken Raisanen assumed the Station Manager position in 1997 and he continues as the Station Manager. Beginning in the 2013‚Äì14 school year, students from the Senior Service Project class have developed their own daily program. The SSP classes developed the first talk format shows and pioneered the'multiple DJ' format. During the 2015‚Äì16 school year, 3 of the 7 day shift blocks are being filled by SSP students. DJs have put together a safe driving campaign with a grant from the Strive for a Safer Drive (S4SD) program jointly sponsored by the State of Michigan and Ford Motor Company. The local campaign is called 'Don't Be Distracted' or 'DbD' for short. WOAS marked another milestone in 2015-16 as one of the DJs has featured a live, interactive broadcast with a fellow fan of the band Aviators each Friday via face to face computer networking from Germany. The station website at www.woas-fm.org hosts the district weather station, audio and video streaming. The FROM THE VAULTS blog also appears weekly in the local newspaper, The Ontonagon Hearld.

His ancestors were alleged to be Scottish rebels and Jacobites, Cavaliers in the Scottish Civil War who had raised the standard of rebellion too often and been exiled to Ireland from their native Angus, Scotland though documentary evidence of this has not been found. His parents were reported by a grandson to have emigrated from Ireland to America in 1737. Robert Todd was in Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County New Jersey by 1743 until 1755 before coming to Chester County later in 1755 and then by 1760 to the portion of neighboring Philadelphia County that later became Montgomery County.Hunterdon County Court Docket, 1743, Hunterdon County Court of Common Pleas, Case 1321, February term 1755, Peter Kemble vs Robert Todd; also tax lists of Chester and Philadelphia County PA He married Ann Rambo in 1766 in Philadelphia County.Pennsylvania Archives: Compiled Marriage Records In 1779, he and his wife and children and his brother Samuel Todd followed his two cousins, William and John Todd, and an uncle Andrew Todd to Bedford County, Pennsylvania.Bedford Co.

He fought at the Battle of Kittaning and was involved in the capture of Fort Duquesne, earning the honor of joining the Rangers. Revolutionary War Todd was a good friend of Benjamin Franklin and was a player in the brewing situation that would explode into the American Revolutionary War. He traveled around Pennsylvania and the New England colonies and was active in Boston. He joined the militia and then the Continentals, and served at the war's early battles, including Bunker Hill, before returning to Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the convention which established Pennsylvania as a Commonwealth and State. He became a Judge from his district at the first elections. He fought bravely for Independence and re-enlisted, this time being more active in the South, serving until 1781 when Lord Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. The above assertions include a mixture of fact and conflation with other Todds. There is no documentary evidence of a connection with Benjamin Franklin, nor evidence that he was in Boston or that he served at the siege of Yorktown. He did serve as \\"second judge\\" on the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas, Quarter Sessions, and Orphan's Court in 1791. Later years After the Revolutionary War, Todd was chosen as a member of Pennsylvania's ratifying convention and voted against ratification of the United States Constitution.

In an attempt to break out from the United States‚Äô racist filled society, antebellum free Blacks emigrated to Haiti. Although a few emigrants left for Haiti during the 1810s, it was not until 1824 that with the support of the Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer that the emigration began in earnest. The Haitian emigration project ran against the wishes of the American Colonization Society, which attempted to remove free Blacks as far as Africa and dreaded the idea of strengthening the Black state of Haiti. Several thousand Blacks departed toward Haiti the summer of 1824 and the flow continued until 1826 when the Haitian government stopped paying and defraying the transportation costs. U.S. Blacks continued moving to Haiti after this, but the numbers were never as high as those that left between the years of 1824‚Äì1826. Another Haitian emigration scheme began in 1859 and lasted for about three years. Even though this project had the support of Abraham Lincoln and other political figures, the frustrations of the 1820s and an increasing Black identification with the U.S. substantially hindered the enthusiasm this time.

It was named by the Spanish explorer Francisco de Eliza after Pedro de Alberni, Captain of the Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia who was appointed in the Spanish fort in Nootka Sound from 1790 to 1792. The inlet includes traditional territories of the Ucluelet, Uchucklesaht, Huu-ay-aht, Hupacasath, and Tseshaht peoples, who are part of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council people. History Good Friday Tsunami Exposed to the open Pacific, Alberni Inlet has been subject to tsunamis. The largest in historic times was the result of the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska in 1964, and destroyed part of downtown Port Alberni. The narrow inlet amplified the size and intensity of the wave, and when it struck the two towns it had a height of . One hour later, a second, larger wave of hit. It was the second wave that caused most of the damage, lifting houses off their foundations and sweeping log booms onto the shore. The second wave was followed by four more waves ranging in height from and occurring at roughly 90-minute intervals. In total, the tsunami washed away 55 homes and damaged 375 others. Tsunamis have repeatedly hit the First Nations village Huu-ay-aht of Sarita, which is situated on a low sand beach about halfway along the inlet's eastern shore. Name change In 1931 there was a recommendation that the name be changed from canal to inlet so that foreign shippers would not mistake it for a canal.

Due to rapid technological advancement, organisations with a basic supply chain can develop this chain into a more complex structure involving a higher level of interdependence and connectivity between more organisations, this constitutes a supply-chain network. Businesses are often part of a larger network of organisations, a supply-chain network can be used to highlight interactions between organisations; they can also be used to show the flow of information and materials across organisations. Supply-chain networks are now more global than ever and are typically structured with five key areas: external suppliers, production centres, distribution centres (DCs), demand zones, and transportation assets Overview All organisations can purchase the components to build a supply-chain network, it is the collection of physical locations, transportation vehicles and supporting systems through which the products and services firm markets are managed and ultimately delivered. Physical locations included in a supply-chain network can be manufacturing plants, storage warehouses, carrier crossdocks, major distribution centres, ports, intermodal terminals whether owned by a company, suppliers, a transport carrier, a third-party logistics provider, a retail store or an end customer. Transportation modes that operate within a supply- chain network can include the many different types of trucks, trains for boxcar or intermodal unit movement, container ships or cargo planes. There are many systems which can be utilised to manage and improve a supply-chain network include Order Management Systems, Warehouse Management System, Transportation Management Systems, Strategic Logistics Modelling, Inventory Management Systems, Replenishment Systems, Supply Chain Visibility, Optimisation Tools and more. Emerging technologies and standards such as the RFID and the GS1 Global Standards are now making it possible to automate these Supply Chain Networks in a real time manner making them more efficient than the simple supply chain of the past.  Supply-Chain Network Design  A supply-chain network can be strategically designed in such a way as to reduce the cost of the supply chain; it has been suggested by experts that 80% of supply chain costs are determined by location of facilities and the flow of product between the facilities. Supply chain network design is sometimes referred to as 'Network Modelling', due to the fact a mathematical model can be created to optimise the supply-chain network. Companies have been led to modify their basic supply chain, investing in the tools and resources to develop an improved SCN design that takes into account taxation regulations, new entrants into their industry and availability of resources, has resulted in more complex network designs. Designing a SCN involves creating a network that incorporates all the facilities, means of production, products, and transportation assets owned by the organisation or those not owned by the organisation but which immediately support the supply-chain operations and product flow. The design should also include details of the number and location of facilities: plants, warehouses, and supplier base. Therefore, it can be said that a SCN design is the combination of nodes with capability and capacity, connected by lanes to help products move between facilities There is no definitive way to design a SCN as the network footprint, the capability and capacity, and product flow‚Äîall intertwine and are interdependent. Following on from this, there is also no single optimal SCN design, in designing the network there is an apparent trade-off between responsiveness, risk tolerance and efficiency.  Reverse Supply-Chain Network Design  A new requirement for 'reverse supply-chain network design' has arisen from the environmental impact of end-of-life goods. This particular network design addresses logistical issues such as collection, processing and recycling of end-of-life goods. Companies that design both forward and reverse supply-chain processes together, with recycling & disposal in mind, have been noted to have the greatest success. Through this, organisations can support goods from production to disposal creating a 'closed-loop system'. = Examples of reverse supply network design = Bosch is a company that capitalises on this closed-loop system by building sensors into their power tool motor. Bosch can quickly assess the state of a motor reducing the cost of inspection and disposal, thereby increasing their profit margin on refurbished power tools.  Supply-Chain-Network Risk Analysis  Though designing a supply-chain network can cut costs within a company, it is important to note the supply chain is not static but rather a continually improving model and adapt in response. A key part of designing the supply-chain network is ensuring the network is versatile enough to cope with future uncertainties. Though there is inherent uncertainty about the future, a supply chain network risk analysis can be conducted; by using information available, the future business environment can be characterised. The uncertainties associated with supply- chain networks fall within two categories, Endogenous uncertainty and Exogenous uncertainty. = Endogenous uncertainty = An uncertainty can be categorised as 'endogenous' when the origin of the risk is within the supply- chain network itself, such as market volatility or technological turbulence. = Exogenous uncertainty = An uncertainty can be categorised as 'exogenous' when the origin of the risk is external to the supply-chain network. Exogenous uncertainties can be further categorised; ongoing risks such as economic volatility, can be described as a 'continuous risk'. 'Discrete' events refer to infrequent events that could disrupt the supply-chain process, such as natural disasters. = Risk management = By distinguishing between these types of uncertainty, an organisation can decide the best approach to risk management. A company has a very limited ability to prevent exogenous uncertainty. The risk to the supply-chain network can be minimised by being well prepared for potential events. Endogenous uncertainty can be somewhat mitigated with precautions such as regular communication between an organisation and supplier. = See also = Document automation in supply- chain management & logistics External links *Building a Flexible Supply Chain Network from SC Digest *End to End SCN Pilot Benefits from SCN References Category:Supply chain management Category:Radio-frequency identification de:Supply-Chain-Management es:Cadena de suministro ","title":"Supply chain network"},{"id":"11183776","text":"A penetration, in firestopping, is an opening, such as one created by the use of a cast-in-place sleeve, in a wall or floor assembly required to have a fire-resistance rating, for the purpose of accommodating the passage of a mechanical, electrical or structural penetrant.

Old terminology The nuclear industry in particular used to refer to firestops as \\"penetration seals\\" or \\"penseals\\". These terms are superseded by the term firestop. Whereas penetration seals or penseals only dealt with openings made to accommodate penetrants, firestops now also include Joint (building). Why the term \\"Penetration (firestop)\\"? It is useful to have clarity in construction communications, to differentiate between the opening, whether sealed or not, and the penetrants, which are optional components of a penetration, as sometimes openings (penetrations of the fire barrier) are created for future use, especially in electrical service rooms. A firestop, after all, tends to be easier to remove than concrete, which requires coredrilling equipment, cooling water, etc. A firestopped penetration may also be referred to as a firestop, as a firestop, by definition, is a system.

Moonraker was the third of the three Bond films for which the theme song was performed by Shirley Bassey. Frank Sinatra was considered for the vocals, before Johnny Mathis was approached and offered the opportunity. Mathis was unhappy about the song and withdrew from the project, leaving the producers scrambling for a replacement. Kate Bush declined as she was due to embark on her British tour, so John Barry offered the song to Bassey just weeks before the release date. As a result, Bassey made the recordings at very short notice and never regarded the song 'as her own' as she had never had the chance to perform it or promote it first. Indeed, Bassey has seldom performed the song live in comparison to her other two Bond themes, Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever. The film uses two versions of the title theme song, a ballad version heard over the main titles, and a disco version for the end titles. Confusingly, the United Artists single release labelled the tracks on the 7\\" single as \\"Moonraker (Main Title)\\" for the version used to close the film and \\"Moonraker (End Title)\\" for the track that opened the film. The song failed to make any real impact on the charts, which may partly be attributed to Bassey's failure to promote the single, given the last minute decision and the way in which it was quickly recorded to meet the schedule.  Composition  As with \\"We Have All the Time in the World\\" back in 1969, Hal David wrote the lyrics. Paul Williams's original lyrics were discarded. Finally in 2005, Bassey sang the song for the first time outside James Bond on stage as part of a medley of her three Bond title songs. An instrumental strings version of the title theme was used in 2007 tourism commercials for the Dominican Republic. The score for Moonraker marked a turning point in Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores and instead scoring the film with slow, rich string passages‚Äîa trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as Raise the Titanic, Out of Africa and Somewhere in Time. Moonraker uses for the first time since Diamonds Are Forever a piece of music called \\"007\\" (briefly, and late in track 7, \\"Bond Arrives in Rio and Boat Chase\\"), the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry which was introduced in From Russia with Love. This is the only time when the \\"007 Theme\\" is used in a Roger Moore Bond film; it is as of 2017 the last time it has been heard in a Bond film. Another link between the soundtracks of Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever is the inclusion of a track titled \\"Bond Smells a Rat\\". The two tracks are not related to each other. Unusually, the score was recorded in Paris‚Äîall of Barry's previous Bond scores had been recorded at London's CTS Studios. The film's production base was in France and it was decided the film would be scored there as well. Like some Bond films, the score for Moonraker has never received an extended release, due to the loss of the original session masters which appear to have been misplaced in France. As such, the album does not contain the \\"James Bond Theme\\" despite it appearing in the film.

The park interprets the history of flour milling in Minneapolis and shows the ruins of several flour mills that were abandoned. The park is the result of an archaeological study of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In 1983, a project was being considered to extend West River Parkway along the west side of the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis. Scott Anfinson, then the municipal county highway archaeologist for the Minnesota Historical Society, developed a plan to assess archaeological sites along the riverfront. A number of test excavations along the route revealed a wide variety of sites containing items of interest. In the Bassett's Creek area, for example, the foundations of two sawmills and the remains of a railroad roundhouse were found, while near Hennepin Avenue, the investigation found the footings of the Great Northern Railway Union Depot and the tower bases of the first and second Hennepin Avenue Bridges. In the milling district, archaeologists found clues suggesting that there were still extensive remains of the foundations of the mills and waterpower system. The first round of archaeological surveys in the 1980s was intended to save the ruins from destruction as a result of road construction projects. Later, in the 1990s, the focus shifted from environmental impact assessment to exposing ruins for their interpretive value. As the ruins were made visible to the public, the goal was to create assets for education, tourism, and commercial development. The excavations for Mill Ruins Park began in 1998 and continued through 2001. The process also involved stabilizing the remains of the Washburn \\"A\\" Mill, which had burned in 1991. The Washburn \\"A\\" Mill became part of the Mill City Museum. Along with the remains of several flour mills and other industrial buildings, the park also contains two stone piers and several iron girder piers that held a trestle for the Minneapolis Eastern Railroad. The tailraces from the waterpower canal are also clearly visible, and the water flow has been restored through the canal. Signs posted along the walkways interpret the ruins and the history of the area. References External links * Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board - Mill Ruins Park * Anfinson, Scott F. (1989).

Early life Battle was born on June 1, 1918 in Dawson, Georgia and his family later moved to Bradenton, Florida. He received his undergraduate (1939) and law (1946) degrees from the University of Florida, and spent World War II in the Navy serving in the Pacific theatre. His wife, Betty Davis Battle (1924‚Äì2004), was a Stanford-educated political scientist, attorney, and arts foundation official at the Woodward Foundation, which placed works by American artists in embassies around the world. State Department career After the war, Battle moved to Washington with the goal of joining the foreign service. He had no prior connections and no Ivy league credentials, but with persistence he was finally hired to the Canada desk of the United States Department of State in 1946, during the administration of President Harry S. Truman. A chance encounter with Dean Acheson led to his being elevated to the position of Special Assistant to the Secretary of State. He traveled with Acheson, served as his right-hand man, attended meetings, and saw every piece of paper that entered or left the Secretary's office. Acheson grew quite fond of his \\"indispensable aide,\\" once noting with a nod toward Battle, that a successful diplomat needs \\"an assistant with nerves of steel, a sense of purpose, and a Southern accent.\\" The two men would remain close friends for the rest of Acheson's life. As Acheson's tenure was coming to a close, Battle moved overseas to serve as First Secretary in the American Embassy, Copenhagen from 1953 to 1955. Then he moved to Paris for one year at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Paris, under Lord Ismay before returning to the States in 1956 to work with the Rockefeller Family as Vice President of Colonial Williamsburg. After the election of President John F. Kennedy in 1960, Battle returned to Washington to rejoin the State Department as its first Executive Secretary (until May 1962). He next served as Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture (June 5, 1962 to August 20, 1964), helping to coordinate cultural events in Washington and working with Senator J. William Fulbright on the Fulbright Scholars program. In September 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him as U.S. Ambassador to the United Arab Republic (Egypt). In Cairo, he faced a number of challenges, including the Thanksgiving Day attack on the U.S. Embassy Library, which was burned to the ground by a group of African students protesting U.S. policies. Battle was effective and well regarded by his Egyptian counterparts, despite increasing tensions between Gamal Abdel Nasser and U.S. officials. On March 5, 1967, Battle left Egypt to return to Washington to take up the position of Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East and North Africa. (He has the rare distinction among Foreign Service officers of having held the position of Assistant Secretary twice.) Within weeks, Israel attacked Egypt and the Six-Day War began. Later career In 1968, Battle resigned from the Foreign Service to work as Vice President of Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). Battle turned down two Ambassadorial posts: to Vietnam in the Johnson administration and to Iran in 1977, thereby avoiding captivity during the Iran hostage crisis. He became president of the Middle East Institute, from 1973 to 1975 before returning to Comsat until 1980. Next he started the Foreign Policy Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in 1980, and finished his career as president of the Middle East Institute from 1986 until his retirement in 1990. In 1984, Ambassador Battle was awarded the Foreign Service Cup, an award given annually to a retired Foreign Service officer by Diplomatic and Consular Officers, Retired.

For example, individuals may learn about a current event from a friend, but later report having learned about it on the local news, thus reflecting an incorrect source attribution. This error occurs when normal perceptual and reflective processes are disrupted, either by limited encoding of source information or by disruption to the judgment processes used in source-monitoring. Depression, high stress levels and damage to relevant brain areas are examples of factors that can cause such disruption and hence source-monitoring errors.Johnson, M.K., Hashtroudi, S., Lindsay, D.S. (1993). Source Monitoring. Psychological Bulletin, 114(1), 3‚Äì28 Introduction One of the key ideas behind source- monitoring is that rather than receiving an actual label for a memory during processing, a person's memory records are activated and evaluated through decision processes; through these processes, a memory is attributed to a source. Source-monitoring relies heavily on the individual's activated memory records; if anything prevents encoding the contextual details of an event while it happens, relevant information will not be fully retrieved and errors will occur. If the attributes of memory representations are highly differentiated, then fewer errors are expected to occur and vice versa.Landau, J.D., Marsh, R.L. (1997). Monitoring Source in an Unconscious Plagiarism Paradigm. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 4(2), 265‚Äì270 Two cognitive judgment processes exist regarding source-monitoring; these are commonly called heuristic and systematic judgement processes.Lindsay, D.S., Johnson, M.K. (1991), Recognition memory and source monitoring. Psychological Bulletin, 29(3), 203‚Äì205 =Heuristic judgements= Heuristic judgements are made quickly without the conscious awareness of the individual, making use of perceptual, contextual, and other event-related information. These occur more frequently because they are efficient and occur automatically without the individual putting forth conscious effort. A decision is made about a source when relevant information is of a certain significance and the memory occurring at a certain time or place makes sense logically; errors then occur based on the amount of information stored at encoding or the way that an individual's brain makes decisions based on prior experiences.Chaiken, S., Liberman, A., Eagly, A.H. (1989). Heuristic and Systematic Information Processing within and beyond the persuasion Context. In J.S. Uleman, & J.A. Bargh (Eds.), Unintended Thought (pp. 212‚Äì252). New York: The Guilford Press. Within the source-monitoring framework, \\"heuristic\\" is a type of decision process; this term is directly related to the psychological heuristics. =Systematic judgements= Systematic judgements are decision processes whose procedures are accessed consciously by the individual; the same types of information used in heuristic judgements are also used in systematic judgements. In this process, all memory-relevant information is retrieved from memory and assessed deliberately to determine whether a memory is likely to have come from a specific source. Systematic judgements occur less frequently in source judgements because they are slow and require a lot of conscious effort. Errors occur due to a misassignment of the weight of certain aspects of memories: assigning high importance to visual information would mean that having poor details of this aspect would be cause for an assumption that the event did not happen or was imagined. Errors will occur if an individual's subjective logic leads them to perceive an event as unlikely to occur or belong to a specific source, even if the truth is otherwise. Simple memory decay can be a source for errors in both judgements, keeping an individual from accessing relevant memory information, leading to source-monitoring errors. Types There are three major types of source-monitoring: external source-monitoring, internal source-monitoring, and reality monitoring, all of which are susceptible to errors and make use of the two judgment processes. =External source-monitoring= This type of source-monitoring focuses on discriminating between externally retrieved sources, such as events happening in the world surrounding the individual. An example of this is determining which one of an individual's friends said something rude. =Internal source- monitoring= This type of source-monitoring focuses on discriminating between internally derived sources, such as the individual's memories. An example of this is differentiating between memories of thought ideas and spoken ideas. =Reality monitoring= This type, also known as internal-external reality monitoring, is derived from the previous two types and focuses on discriminating between internally and externally retrieved sources. An example of this is discriminating a plane crashing into a building portrayed in real life and in a newspaper.McDaniel, M.A., Lyle, K.B., Butler, K.M., & Dornburg, C.C. (2008). Age-Related Deficits in Reality Monitoring. Psychology and Aging, 23(3), 646‚Äì656. Relationship to brain Observations have been made that indicate a relationship between the frontal areas of the brain and source- monitoring errors. These errors can be seen in amnesic patients, older adults, and in patients suffering from organic brain disease with frontal lobe damage. There are many processes that occur in the frontal regions that are important for source-monitoring; these include circuits linked with the hippocampus that encourage feature binding and structures that play a role in strategic retrieval. Processes which promote the binding or clustering of features, both physically and cognitively during encoding and retrieval, are important to source memory.Mitchell, K. J., Johnson, M. K., Raye, C. L., & Greene, E. J. (2004). Prefrontal Cortex Activity Associated with Source Monitoring in a Working Memory Task. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 16(6), 921-934. doi:10.1162/0898929041502724 Aging Many experiments have been done in an attempt to find whether source-monitoring errors are more prevalent in a particular age group;Cohen, G., Faulkner, D. (1989). Age Differences in Source Forgetting: Effects on Reality Monitoring and on Eyewitness Testimony. Psychology and Aging, 4(1), 10‚Äì17. they are most prevalent in elderly individuals and young children. It has been proposed that source-monitoring errors are common in young children because they have difficulties with differentiating real and imaginary ideas, confirming that young children have difficulties in aspects of reality monitoring. With regards to eyewitness testimony, elderly individuals are more likely to make errors in identifying the source of a memory, making them more susceptible to misleading information. Reality monitoring may often lead to source-monitoring errors because a memory may not be typical of its original class. For example, if an internal memory contains a large amount of sensory information, it may be incorrectly recalled as externally retrieved.Hashtroudi, S., Johnson, M.K., Chrosniak, L.D. (1989). Aging and Source Monitoring. Psychology and Aging, 4(1), 106‚Äì112. Related phenomena =Old-new recognition= Old-new recognition is a measurement method used to assess recognition memory. The process is that a participant indicates if an item is new by responding \\"no\\" and vice versa. Errors can occur in this form of recognition in a similar fashion to how they occur in source-monitoring; errors occur more frequently when objects are very similar, when circumstances of the situation make information retrieval difficult (like distractions or stress), or when the judgment processes are impaired in some way. The heuristic and systematic judgment process in particular are suspected to be the similar to those used in source-monitoring, with higher levels of differentiation needed for source- monitoring processes than for recognition. =Remember-know= Remember versus know judgements are processes for evaluating memory awareness, where an individual must distinguish between remembering or knowing. When a memory is remembered, the experience can be relived mentally, and related details are brought to mind without difficulty. When a memory is known, the experience cannot be relived but individuals feel a sense of familiarity, often leading to confident (mis)attribution to a likely source. Both judgements are subject to source-monitoring errors, and it has been demonstrated that under some circumstances, such as in the DRM paradigm, remember judgements are more likely to occur.Roediger III, H.L., & McDermott, K.B. (1995). Creating False Memories: Remembering Words not Presented in Lists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21(4), 803‚Äì814. =DRM paradigm= The Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm, or DRM paradigm, is a cognitive psychological procedure to study false memory in humans, wherein a list of related words (e.g. bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, wake, snooze, blanket, doze, slumber, snore, nap, peace, yawn, drowsy) is presented to a participant. The individual is then asked to free recall the words from the list, and results often find that subjects falsely remember related words (i.e. sleep) just as often as they recall presented words.Roediger, H.L., & McDermott, K. B. (1995). Creating false memories: Remembering words not presented in lists. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 24(4), 803‚Äì814. This represents a source-monitoring error because participants who recall the non-presented word, they are demonstrating an inability to distinguish if the source of the word is their own thoughts or the list of presented words. =False fame= In the false fame experiment, participants are presented with a list of non-famous names. Later, they are presented with the same names as before, with new non-famous and famous people. The participants then have to determine which names are famous, and the typical finding is that the old non-famous names are often misidentified as famous. This is a source-monitoring error because they have attributed the name's actual origin to a source other than the list where they originally read it.Jacoby, L.L., Kelley, C., Brown, J., & Jasechko, J. (1989). Becoming Famous Overnight: Limits on the Ability to Avoid Unconscious Influences of the Past. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(3), 326‚Äì338. There have been studies linking individuals who believe in false, abnormal life events (like memories from past lives) to an increased proneness to source-monitoring errors. Specifically, these individuals demonstrate more errors in the false fame task than people who do not have such fabricated memories of abnormal life events. In the case of past-life memories, the sources of certain memories are incorrectly attributed to a previous life. Individuals may falsely believe in the existence of certain people, movies, books, dreams, or imaginary scenarios that never truly happened, making them more likely to misidentify non-famous names as 'famous,' likely as a result of misbelieving the name refers to a famous person from their past life.Peters, M.J.V., Horselenberg, R., Jelicic, M., Merckelbach, H. (2007). The false fame illusion in people with memories about a previous life. Consciousness and Cognition, 16, 162‚Äì169. =Cryptomnesia= Cryptomnesia is unintentional plagiarism occurring when a person produces something believing that it was self- generated, when it was actually generated earlier, either internally or by an external source. This may occur because of distractions during initial exposure to information. Even if the information is acquired unconsciously, the area of the brain related to that information will be highly activated for a short amount of time. This may lead a person to generate ideas that were actually acquired from an outside source or personally generated earlier. Heuristic judgement processes are typically used for source judgements; since there was interference during initial exposure, the heuristic processes will likely judge the source of the information to be internally generated. Related disorders Source-monitoring errors can occur in both healthy and non-healthy individuals alike. They have been observed in neurological and psychiatric populations such as amnesics, individuals who have undergone a cingulotomy, obsessive compulsive individuals and alcoholics.Moritz, S., Woodward, T.S., Ruff, C.C. (2003). Source monitoring and memory confidence in schizophrenia. Psychological Medicine, 33, 131‚Äì139. =Schizophrenia= Source-monitoring errors have been found to be more frequent among schizophrenic individuals than among healthy individuals; the inclination to make such errors may be phenotypic and related to hostility. Studies have suggested that source-monitoring difficulties in schizophrenics are due to failure encoding the source of self-generated items and the tendency to attribute new items to a previously presented source; another suggestion is that the afflicted perceive internal stimuli as real events.Vinogradov, S. et al. (1997). Clinical and Neurocognitive Aspects of Source Monitoring Errors in Schizophrenia. Am J Psychiatry, 154, 1530‚Äì1537. Several of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia imply that patients with the disorder are not capable of monitoring the initiation of certain kinds of self-generated thought, leading to a deficit called autonoetic agnosia: an impairment in the ability to identify self-generated mental events.Keefe, R.S.E. et al. (1999). Source monitoring deficits in patients with schizophrenia; a multinomial modeling analysis. Psychological Medicine, 29, 903‚Äì914.

History In the 12th century Cluniac monks of the Order of Saint Benedict founded a monastery at Monkton Farleigh, acquiring land in the neighbourhood. On the Dissolution of the Monasteries the priory and abbey land, including the manor of Monkton, were given to Sir Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford. Seymour leased it in 1600 to Edward Long,Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office, Long Family Records, Cat. 947/1417 son of a wealthy Wiltshire clothier, Henry Long of Whaddon. Edward had already purchased the manor of Rood Ashton three years before. Long later bought the house on 15 May 1615 and left it to his two sons Edward and John, who occupied it in succession. John appears to have carried out an extensive building programme in or around 1647 (marked by a plaque on the wall of the house) involving repairs, alterations, re-roofing and an extension on the eastern side. A chimney-piece with heavy carving, believed to be part of an altar tomb from Monkton Farleigh Priory is in one of the bedrooms. At some point during the English Civil War the household was forced to accommodate soldiers fighting for Cromwell's Parliamentarian army. Possibly John's building programme stretched his finances as he was labelled a delinquent (1649‚Äì50) and his estate was sequestered. He was succeeded by his son Thomas Long of Rowden in Chippenham (died 1691), the estate was secured, and continued in the Long family until 10 May 1669 when Thomas sold it to Sir James Thynne of Longleat. However, Thomas appears to have continued to rent the property until 1671. William Thynne then appears as the owner.Peter Waterman, Wiltshire Libraries and Heritage Service The house is currently owned by the Kirk family.

Early life and priesthood Born in Mexico, Bishop Zavala grew up in Los Angeles. He studied at St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo, California. Additionally, he earned a licentiate in canon law from Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in Washington, DC. He was ordained a priest on May 28, 1977. As a priest, he served as an associate pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in East Los Angeles, associate director of the marriage tribunal for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, professor of canon law and the rector of St. John's Seminary. Episcopal career Zavala was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on February 8, 1994 and received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Roger Mahony on March 19 of that year. He served as the auxiliary bishop and episcopal vicar of the San Gabriel Pastoral Region until his retirement. Bishop Zavala promoted restorative justice, opposed the death penalty, supported young people, and was a long-time supporter of immigration reform,. Although he was sometimes considered orthodox in his beliefs, he had a long history of supporting controversial positions on homosexuality. Zavala was involved with a number of organizations: he was the bishop president of the U.S. section of Pax Christi, the international Catholic peace movement; the Co-President of Interfaith Worker Justice, an organization committed to educating, mobilizing, and organizing the religious community to advocate for better wages and working conditions for low-wage workers; and served as the Episcopal advisor to the International Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care (ICCPPC). Also, he was an adjunct professor of Canon Law and Pastoral Theology in the graduate programs of Theology and Pastoral Theology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. =Resignation= On January 4, 2012, Los Angeles archbishop Jos√© G√≥mez announced that the Vatican had accepted Zavala's resignation following the disclosure that Zavala is the father of two teenaged children. The pope accepted the resignation under Code of Canon Law c. 401 ¬ß2. In his announcement, Archbishop G√≥mez stated that Zavala disclosed the matter to him in early December 2011, that he had not been in ministry since, and that Zavala \\"will be living privately\\". G√≥mez went on to state that the children ‚Äì who remain unidentified ‚Äì are minors living with their mother in another state, and that the archdiocese would assist the children with college costs. Though not specified, it was also revealed by the Los Angeles Times that his relationship with the children's mother, who had separate pregnancies, was \\"more than a passing relationship.\\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/01/archbishop-calls- for-prayer-after-priest-admits-fathering-children.html Legacy Zavala emerged as a leading Catholic voice within the archdiocese and well beyond the southern California region on a wide range of social justice and human rights issues. He championed the needs of marginalized individuals, especially the poor, immigrants, incarcerated juvenile and adult offenders and condemned inmates. Through his leadership positions, he helped link the principles of Catholic social teaching to the work of promoting peace, conflict resolution and restorative justice. He was honored in 2004 by Death Penalty Focus for his statewide efforts to bring restorative justice reforms to the criminal justice system and to abolish the death penalty. In May 2011 he was recognized as a 'giant of justice' by Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice (CLUE) for his social justice leadership at local and national levels.

Career Howell helped the Superbas win the 1900 National League pennant. He led the National League in games finished (non-starts) in 1900 (10) and the American League in 1903 (10) and led the American League in Complete Games (35) in 1905. Howell currently ranks 82nd on the MLB All-Time ERA List (2.74), 87th on the All-Time Complete Games List (244) and 68th on the Hit Batsmen List (97). He is also the Baltimore Orioles career leader in ERA (2.06). In 13 seasons, he had a 131‚Äì146 Win‚ÄìLoss record, 340 Games (282 Started), 244 Complete Games, 20 Shutouts, 53 Games Finished, 6 Saves, 2,567 ‚Öî Innings Pitched, 2,435 Hits Allowed, 1,158 Runs Allowed, 781 Earned Runs Allowed, 27 Home Runs Allowed, 677 Walks, 986 Strikeouts, 97 Hit Batsmen, 53 Wild Pitches, 7,244 Batters Faced, 1 Balk, 2.74 ERA and a 1.212 WHIP. After his playing career ended, he was an umpire for 85 games in the Federal League in 1915. =1910 Chalmers Award Scandal= Howell, along with the Jack O'Connor, the Browns player-manager, was involved in the scandal surrounding efforts to help Cleveland's Nap Lajoie win the batting title and the associated 1910 Chalmers Award over Ty Cobb in the last two games of the season, a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. Cobb was leading Lajoie .385 to .376 in the batting race going into that last day. O'Connor ordered rookie third baseman Red Corriden to station himself in shallow left field to allow what otherwise would be routine infield ground outs to be base hits. Lajoie bunted five straight times down the third base line and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie reached base on a fielding error, officially giving him a hitless at-bat and lowering his average. O'Connor and Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit, offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by less than one point over Lajoie, .385069 to .384095. The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president Ban Johnson, who declared Cobb the rightful winner of the batting title (though Chalmers awarded cars to both players). At his insistence, Browns' owner Robert Hedges fired both O'Connor and Howell, and released them as players; both men were informally banned from baseball for life. In 1981, however, research revealed that one game was counted twice for Cobb when he went 2-for-3. As a result, his 1910 batting statistics should have been shown as 194-for-506 and .383399, less than .0007 behind Lajoie at 227-for-591.

TSF presents four weeks of performances during late June and July of five productions in repertory: two plays by Shakespeare, a classic, a musical, and a children's show. History Established in 1986, the Texas Shakespeare Festival began as Kilgore College's contribution to the Texas Sesquicentennial celebration. The brainchild of Raymond Caldwell, a faculty member within the theatre program at Kilgore College and subsequent Artistic Director of the Festival, the first season of TSF consisted of two plays by Shakespeare and The Daisy Bradford 3, a regional work commissioned for the celebration telling the story of the East Texas oil boom by Gifford Wingate, all performed by a small company of professional actors. The overwhelming popularity and quality of the summer theatre experience for the people of East Texas catapulted what was to have been a one-time event into an organization that is celebrating its second decade of performances. More than 1000 theatre artists have worked at TSF including such well-known personalities as Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under; Dexter); Danny Pino (Cold Case); Glenn Fleshler (Spring Awakening; Guys and Dolls); Rick Holmes (Spamalot); Andrew Samonsky (South Pacific; Tick, Tick... Boom!); Glenn Kessler (Creator, Producer, Director and Actor for Damages); and Keythe Farley (co-author, Bat Boy: The Musical). The Texas Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book Shakespeare Festivals Around the World by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004. =Productions= In more than twenty years, the Texas Shakespeare Festival has produced twenty-nine plays of Shakespeare's canon, as well as multiple American and European classics, original works, numerous musicals, and very successful shows for young audiences. Their work with young audience led to them being awarded a grant in 2005 to further support youth activities. The Festival continues to audition and employ professional directors, actors, designers, and technicians, as well as giving many university students from all across America their first summer theatre experience. The Festival has attracted a range of attention throughout its more than two-decades of performances. In 1999 a production of Angels in America produced by the Kilgore College Theatre Department and directed by Caldwell, led to death threats, anti-gay protests and a withdrawal of more than $50,000 in funding by the Gregg County Commissioners. Subsequently, however, the Festival received grants from both Paul Newman's Own PEN Center, the Dramatists Guild of America, and other sympathetic sources nationwide. Support Kilgore College provides the majority of the funding for the Festival, and provides a range of other support for the festival including: rehearsal facilities, office spaces, the Van Cliburn Auditorium, dormitory housing and meals for the entire company, scholarships for the apprentices, printing, publicity and public relations. Additional grants and foundations enable the Texas Shakespeare Festival to continue as a strong and vital cultural asset and tourist attraction for all of East Texas. The Festival is also credited as bringing a degree of sophistication in the arts world to East Texas. In return, the Festival supports the college with grant funding to help refurbish the auditorium in which it performs.

Underground activist Niculi was born in Ia≈üi to a working- class family. Early on he started as an apprentice, then becoming a typographer. Starting in 1912 he actively joined the labour movement, participating in many work-related actions by Ia≈üi typographers and textile workers. In 1921, he joined the newly founded Romanian Communist Party (PCR), banned in 1924. Between 1923 and 1931, he served as secretary of the local workers' commission in Ia≈üi, affiliated with the General Council of Unitary Romanian Trade Unions. In this capacity, he represented Ia≈üi workers at congresses in Sibiu, Cluj and Timi»ôoara. Between 1925 and 1933, he was active in the Workers and Peasants' Bloc, as well as in other organisations founded and run by the PCR. He had an important role in the demonstrations at the Ia≈üi People's House (set up between 1918 and 1921), in printing the newspaper Moldova Ro≈üie (\\"Red Moldavia\\") in the nearby village of VlƒÉdiceni, in obtaining important documents needed for underground work, as well as in the activity of other workers' and socialist organisations in Ia≈üi. Because of the conspiratorial activity he undertook and of the leadership roles he held in Communist workers' organisations, Niculi was arrested numerous times and sentenced to prison, serving time in facilities for political prisoners at Galata, Chi≈üinƒÉu, Doftana and T√¢rgu Jiu. Communist politician Presidium of the People's Republic of Romania After a coup overthrew Ion Antonescu's r√©gime on August 23, 1944 (see Romania during World War II), he was given sensitive party and state posts. At the November 1946 election, he was elected a deputy for the PCR-led Bloc of Democratic Parties, serving as vice president of the Chamber of Deputies. When the Romanian People's Republic was proclaimed on December 30, 1947, Niculi was elected member (vice president) of the Presidium of the Romanian People's Republic, serving from that date until April 13, 1948, alongside Constantin Ion Parhon, Mihail Sadoveanu, ≈ûtefan Voitec and Gheorghe Stere. For the first time in modern Romanian history, a worker shared the position of head of state. A member of the regional Moldavian Committee of the PCR from 1946, in 1948 Niculi was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party (as the PCR was now called). In 1955 he was elected a member of the party's Central Review Committee. From 1953 to 1956, he was president of the Executive Committee of the Popular Assembly of the city of Ia≈üi (a position equivalent to that of mayor). In recognition of his merits, the Romanian Socialist Republic (as it was called from 1965) decorated Niculi with the important title \\"Hero of Socialist Labour\\", as well as with other orders and medals. Aged 92, he died in Ia≈üi in 1979, being buried in that city's Eternitatea Cemetery.

History Charles Baker's group of prospectors found traces of placer gold in the San Juan Mountains in 1860 at Eureka. Forced out by the Ute Tribe in 1861, who had been awarded the area in a US treaty, the prospectors returned in 1871, when lode gold was found in the Little Giant vein at Arrastre Gulch near Silverton, Colorado. The miners were allowed to stay after the Brunot Treaty of 13 Sept. 1873. In exchange for giving up 4 million acres, the Southern Ute Indian Reservation received $25,000 per year.Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, By 1875, Eureka had a post office. The original mill was closed (reasons unknown) but to replace it, the Gold Prince Mill from Animas Forks was deconstructed and moved to the Eureka townsite to become the Sunnyside mill. In 1896, Eureka was connected to the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad via the Silverton Northern Railroad. Although the community grew steadily ‚Äî not like a boomtown ‚Äî it quickly declined after 1939, when the Sunnyside Mill closed for the last time. Today, the original townsite gravel roads remain, and debris litters the area. The only remaining structure is the Eureka jail, which has been restored. Foundations remain of the Sunnyside mill.

Background Although the song has a lead vocal by Brown (who also wrote the tune and the lyrics), the recording is credited to \\"Fred Wesley & The J.B.'s\\". It was the first J.B.'s recording to feature saxophonist Maceo Parker, who had returned to work with Brown again after attempting a career as a bandleader. \\"Doing It to Death\\" contains an uncommon key change in which Brown tells the band to modulate downward from F to D (\\"In order for me to get down, I have to get down in D\\"). Composers who place key changes in tunes typically have them modulate upwards. Unusually for a James Brown song, the actual words \\"doing it to death\\" appear nowhere in the song's lyrics, which feature the hook \\"we're gonna have a funky good time.\\" The title came from a figure of speech Brown heard Wesley use.

She earned her bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1896. She received her master‚Äôs degree (1897) and Ph.D. (1899) from Columbia University. Every other year, the American Ethnological Society awards the Elsie Clews Parsons Prize for the best graduate student essay, in her honor. Biography Parsons was the daughter of Henry Clews, a wealthy New York banker, and Lucy Madison Worthington. Her brother, Henry Clews Jr., was an artist. On September 1, 1900, in Newport, Rhode Island, she married future three-term progressive Republican congressman Herbert Parsons, an associate and political ally of President Teddy Roosevelt. When her husband was a member of Congress, she published two then-controversial books under the pseudonym John Main. Parsons became interested in anthropology in 1910. She believed that folklore was a key to understanding a culture and that anthropology could be a vehicle for social change. Her work Pueblo Indian Religion is considered a classic; here she gathered all her previous extensive work and that of other authors. It is, however, marred by intrusive and deceptive research techniques. She is, however, pointed to by current critical scholars as an archetypical example of an \\"Antimodern Feminist\\" thinker, known for their infatuation with Native American Indians that often manifested as a desire to preserve a \\"traditional\\" and \\"pure\\" Indian identity, irrespective of how Native Peoples themselves approached issues of modernization or cultural change. Scholars Sandy Grande and Margaret D. Jacobs argue that her racist and objectivizing tendencies towards indigenous peoples of the Americas are evidenced, for example, by her willingness to change her name and appropriate a Hopi identity primarily to increase her access to research sites and participants.  Feminist ideas  Parsons feminist beliefs were viewed as extremely radical for her time. She was a proponent of trial marriages, divorce by mutual consent and access to reliable contraception, which she wrote about in her book The Family (1906). She also wrote about the effects society had on the growth of individuals, and more precisely the effect of gender role expectations and how they stifle individual growth for both women and men. The Family (1906) was met with such back-lash she published her second book Religious Chastity (1913) under the pseudonym \\"John Main\\" as to not affect her husband, Herbert Parsons political career. Her ideas where so far ahead that only after her death did they begin to be discussed. This has led to her becoming recognized as one of the early pioneers of the feminist movement. Her writings and her lifestyle challenged conventional gender roles at the time and helped spark the conversation for gender equality.

Originally a salt-water lagoon, its outlets to the bay were cut off because of over flooding. The park has become an estuary to many migrating birds and ongoing improvements have been made into preserving the park. Today Lake El Estero not only draws in many eager adults for its beauty and history but attracts kids for its baseball diamond, skatepark, and world-famous Dennis the Menace Playground.  History  When El Estero was first discovered it was a lagoon filled with brackish water. Three major streams flowed into the lagoon. One stream went south to where San Carlos Cathedral currently is. The second went to the location of the County's courthouse. The final stream followed (today's) Del Monte Boulevard and flowed into the bay. In 1770 the first map of Lake El Estero was made by Miguel Costanso, a Spanish officer and engineer in the first expedition to California. The lagoon flooded constantly and in 1846 Walter Colton, a chaplain for the U.S. Navy, found a solution to the flooding problems. In his diary he wrote that ‚Äú‚Ä¶it would be a good scheme to cut a channel between the two (the lagoon and the Bay)‚Äù (The Years in California, Walter Colton). In April 1874 the Monterey and Salinas Valley Railroad was built which permanently cut off the stream connecting El Estero to the Bay. This halted the flooding and turned the lagoon into the freshwater lake that we know today. From 1930 to 1931 efforts were made in turning the lake into an aquatic park. This was called the El Estero Development Project that was led by the City of Monterey. Eighty thousand cubic yards of mud were moved in its development. El Estero has been a popular resting spot for migrating birds and in 1933 the bird refuge was named after Harry Ashland Greene, who had a great impact in its development. Between 1938 and 1951 vast improvements were done to the park including ‚Äúdrudging and shoreline plantings (‚ÄúMonterey City of Parks/ El Estero‚Äù)‚Äù and ‚Äútwo bridges connecting Pearl with Second and Fifth Streets (‚ÄúMonterey City of Parks/ El Estero‚Äù)‚Äù. These new bridges connected downtown with the Oak Grove District. In 1984 the lake was drained in order to remove 6,000 truckloads of silt, which was clogging drains. People were also worried that there may be bacteria and bird droppings in the mud. Storm drains were rerouted so silt and mud would be dumped into smaller ponds. This allowed workers to remove it more easily.  An ecosystem  Lake El Estero is an ecosystem that supports large amounts of life and is home to a countless number of birds, fish, and plants. Over 300 species of birds live in Lake El Estero Park. Many birds migrating south stop at the lake to rest such as the ring-billed gull, the western gull, the California gull, the mud hen, the black-crowned night heron, and the great blue heron. During the summer the brown pelican comes in from the south. Many ducks live there year-round such as the mallard. Many others find a home in Lake El Estero such as the ruddy duck, bufflehead duck, and Canada goose. Feeding the birds has been prohibited and they rely on local vegetation. Many other animals live in the waters of Lake El Estero, including the western pond turtle, Pacific tree frog, red-legged frog, crayfish, and several varieties of fish such as the tule perch, Sacramento perch, and Sacramento blackfish. There is a large amount of vegetation in Lake El Estero important to the many organisms that live there. The California Tule of California Bulrush provides a good nesting site for birds and its stems make a refuge for fish. Other commonly seen plants and trees are the Monterey cypress, the Monterey pine, the cattail, the coast live oak, the arroyo willow, and the yellow willow.  Other parts of El Estero Park Many parks and attractions have been developed in El Estero Park to attract both tourists and locals. The most popular of these is the Dennis the Menace Playground. Designed by cartoon writer Hank Ketcham and with the help of sculptor Arch Garner, the park opened on November 17, 1956. With a variety of children's play areas, the park became a great success. One of these unique structures is the 1924 locomotive steam engine, donated by the Southern Pacific Railroad. In 1986 a thorough renovation of the park was done. The renovation was led by architect Richard Murray and cost at least $300,000. In this renovation a 30-ft tall rope swing was added along with other new playground equipment. In 2006 a statue of the park's mascot, Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics), was stolen. The bronze statue was ripped from its place, and it is speculated that it might have been melted and sold. A replacement statue was given to the park on March 27, 2007. It was donated by Willis W. and Ethel M. Clark Foundation, founders of the California Test Bureau, now known as CTB McGraw Hill. Other attractions in El Estero Park include the El Estero Ball Park, which is used by the Junior League, the Women's Soccer League, and other sport clubs, a dog park, and a skatepark, designed by 40 local skaters. Directly across the lake from Dennis the Menace Playground is El Estero Boating. They have fiberglass paddleboats for rent to tour the lake for half hour or hour rides on regular style boats or large white swan boats. The boats carry up to 4-5 people, and a boat ride around the lake and its little island has been enjoyed by locals and tourists for several generations.

It is a glossy black, chestnut and white bird, slightly smaller than either the Amur paradise flycatcher or Blyth's paradise flycatcher, but similar in appearance. Males have exceptionally long tails. Females are generally duller in appearance and have shorter tails. It is a migratory species, breeding in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the far north of the Philippines. Outside the breeding season it migrates to China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, other parts of the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra, Indonesia. Taxonomy and systematics The Japanese paradise flycatcher was previously classified with the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, but the paradise-flycatchers, monarch flycatchers and Australasian fantails are now normally grouped with the drongos in the family Dicruridae, which has most of its members in Australasia and tropical southern Asia. =Subspecies= Three subspecies are recognized: * T. a. atrocaudata - (Eyton, 1839): Found in central and southern Korea, Japan and Taiwan * T. a. illex - Bangs, 1901: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Ryukyu Islands * T. a. periophthalmica - (Ogilvie-Grant, 1895): Originally described as a separate species. Found on Lanyu Island (off of southeast Taiwan) and Batan Island (northern Philippines) T. a. periophthalmica Description The Japanese paradise flycatcher is similar in appearance to both the Amur paradise flycatcher and Blyth's paradise flycatcher, but is slightly smaller. Mature males have a black hood with a purplish-blue gloss which shades into blackish-grey on the chest. The underparts are off-white to white. The mantle, back, wings and rump are plain dark chestnut. The tail has extremely long black central feathers, which are shorter in immature males. Unlike the Asian paradise flycatcher there is no white morph. The female resembles the male but is duller and darker brown on the chestnut areas. It has black legs and feet, a large black eye with a blue eye-ring, and a short blue bill. The song is rendered in Japanese as tsuki-hi-hoshi, hoi-hoi-hoi, which translates to Moon-Sun-Stars and gives the Japanese name of the bird „Çµ„É≥„Ç≥„Ç¶„ÉÅ„Éß„Ç¶ (‰∏âÂÖâÈ≥•) sank≈çch≈ç (literally, bird of three lights, i.e. moon, sun, star, from san three + k≈ç lights + ch≈ç bird). Distribution and habitat The Japanese paradise flycatcher is mainly migratory and breeds in shady mature deciduous or evergreen broadleaf forest of Japan (southern Honsh≈´, Shikoku, Kyushu and the Nansei Shoto islands), South Korea, Taiwan (including Lanyu island) and the far north Philippines. It is a non-breeding visitor to mainland China, the Russian Far East, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra, Indonesia. In Jeju-do of South Korea, Gotjawal Forest, a forest formed on a rocky area of volcanic AA Lava, is one of the important breeding sites of Japanese paradise flycatcherOh, Hong-shik, Byung-soo Kim, and Wanbyung Kim, 2002, Study on the bird communities of Mt.

An ethnic Mende from the Pujehun District, he became a member of the House of Representatives in 1967. He had previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Health, Minister of Trade and Industry and Attorney General and Minister of Justice. In 1987, he was falsely accused by Inspector General Bambay Kamara of plotting a coup against President Joseph Saidu Momoh and hanged for treason in 1989. Early life and education Minah was born on 19 August 1929 in Sawula, Pujehun District, British Sierra Leone. He was a cousin of Siaka Probyn Stevens. He received his education at Methodist Boys High School and read law at King's College London. In 1962, he was called to the bar at Grays Inn. Minah was a member of the Mende ethnic group. Career and politics He operated a private law practice in Sierra Leone. He was one of Siaka Stevens' closest political allies. In 1967, he entered politics and became a member of Parliament for Pujehun South District rising through the ranks and eventually becoming Vice President of Sierra Leone. During his tenure, Minah became one of the most powerful politicians in Sierra Leone. Minah orchestrated the constitutional amendments necessary for President Stevens to pass over Vice President S.I.Koroma and make Brigadier General Joseph Saidu Momoh his successor. He returned to Sierra Leone and served in many capacities as Sierra Leone's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Health, Minister of Justice and Attorney General and Minister of Finance, under former president Siaka Stevens. He was later appointed the Vice President of Sierra Leone under former president Joseph Saidu Momoh administration. Trial and execution On 23 March 1987, police raided a house in Freetown and reported the discovery of heavy artillery, including rocket launchers. Minah and 17 others (including Jamil Sahid Mohamed) were arrested and accused of planning to assassinate President Momoh and intending to stage a coup d'√©tat in order to make Minah president of Sierra Leone. In October 1987, after a five-month trial and four hours of deliberation, the jury delivered a guilty verdict.

Not only was he one of the best known of the early composers of madrigals, and an important native Italian composer during a period of domination by composers from the Low Countries, but he was the most prominent musician in Florence for several decades during the reign of Cosimo I de' Medici.D'Accone, Grove online Life He was born in Florence. By 1515 he was a choirboy and was enrolled in the cathedral school; around this time he probably studied organ with Bartolomeo degli Organi, and composition with Bernardo Pisano. On October 22, 1527, he became chaplain at the baptistry, and in 1531 entered indirectly into the employ of the Medici as both chaplain and organist at the church of San Lorenzo, the Medici family church. From 1535 to 1539 he was organist at San Lorenzo, and from 1540 until his death was maestro di cappella to the court of the Duke of Florence, Cosimo I de' Medici. During his long tenure as maestro di cappella to the Medici, he gradually rose in position and prominence in Florence. In the chapel, he was successively chaplain, supernumerary canon, and canon; and in addition he held auxiliary positions such as chamberlain and archivist. In the 1560s he was replaced by Alessandro Striggio as the composer for most of the sumptuous musical productions of the Medici court, but he retained the position of maestro di cappella. Corteccia died in Florence in 1571, at the beginning of a period of musical decline at the Medici court. Music Portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici by Angelo Bronzino. Cosimo was a patron of the arts and music, and Corteccia's lifelong employer The court of the Medici was one of the most opulent in Europe, and the Florentine family was keenly aware of their status and prestige, as shown by the artistic creations they inspired, ordered, or bought. Corteccia served the Medici for most of his life, and helped create some of the Medici's most elaborate entertainments. Later composers for the Medici, such as Alessandro Striggio, continued in the same vein, creating some of the largest and most extravagant polyphonic compositions of the entire era.Moroney, pp. 4‚Äì5 Corteccia wrote most of his music relatively early in his career; his production peaked in the early 1540s. His music is both sacred and secular, and much of it, unusually for a composer prior to the birth of opera, is specifically for the stage. He was also atypical among the first generation of madrigal composers in that he had a complete published collection of his music dedicated only to him: his First Book of Madrigals for Four Voices, published in Venice in 1544. Some of his madrigals differ from the usual vocal music of the time in having specifically indicated instrumental accompaniment, a result of being composed for theatrical occasions. =Sacred music= Corteccia's sacred music includes settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (lost), hymns, and many motets. While he wrote most of this music early in his career, the bulk of it was not published until 1570 and 1571, in Venice, possibly due to the lack of publishing capacity in Florence prior to that time.D'Accone, Grove Corteccia wrote a letter for the dedication of the several volumes of motets, and in it indicated that he had been working on them and refining them for 30 years. Many of the modifications he made were in keeping with the liturgical reforms of the Council of Trent. The hymn settings are mostly in responsory format, i.e., a verse is sung in plainchant, the next in polyphony, and then the formula repeats. Corteccia varies the texture in the polyphonic sections from strict imitation to free counterpoint, with occasional homophonic interludes, providing variety. =Intermedii and madrigals= As court composer to Cosimo de' Medici, Corteccia was required to write music, often intermedii, for various lavish court entertainments and spectacles, which often included weddings. Intermedii were sung interludes between acts of plays, with the most elaborate being those performed for state occasions. Often these interludes consisted of groups of madrigals, related to the subject matter of the play; in that they are staged, sung, and part of a dramatic production, they are seen as one of the predecessors of opera. One such intermedio by Corteccia was the set of seven madrigals he wrote for the wedding in June 1539 of Duke Cosimo to Eleonora di Toledo, descriptions of which survive in some detail. These madrigals, which were written for the play Il commodo by Antonio Landi, were sung in costume, with the singers playing nymphs, shepherds, mermaids, sea nymphs, and sea monsters (the three sea nymphs played flutes; the sea monsters, lutes). The entire performance was elaborately orchestrated, with the singers variously accompanied by harpsichord, nightingale stop on the organ, bass viol, cornett, crumhorns, flutes, violin, violone, and a quartet of trombones; during the finale, 20 bacchantes, mostly drunk and consisting of ladies and satyrs, were to come on stage singing and playing pipe, tabor, violin, harp, cornetts, crumhorns, and tambourine, and the performance closed with entrance and song by the personification of Night, accompanied by four trombones.Nuttall, Grove online The madrigals are also notable in that four of them, every alternate one, were the first in note nere rapid style. The 1539 performance was one of many, but was one for which a detailed description survived. He also wrote, for example, a set of five madrigals in four voices to be performed between the acts of Francesco d'Ambra's comedy Il furto in 1544. Many of his madrigals are lost, but another surviving set, from 1565, was written in collaboration with Alessandro Striggio. In this set each composer contributed three madrigals; once again it was for a Medici wedding, and like the previous, was designed for performance between the acts of a play by d'Ambra. Many of his published madrigals, for four to six voices, give no hint in the score of the extravagance of their original premi√®res. They are full of textural contrast, as befits their dramatic origin. His earlier work shows the influence of the frottola, and often his style mimics Arcadelt's. The madrigals he wrote for the Medici weddings are often in a note nere, i.e. \\"black note\\" style: choppy rhythms, quick note values, sudden textural contrasts; in addition, they were usually designed for instrumental accompaniment, and consequently the soprano and bass lines often stand out. In this they foreshadow the development of monody by the Florentine Camerata later in the century.Reese, p. 325 References and further reading * Frank d'Accone, \\"Francesco Corteccia\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

Under the name as Sandy Barr, he was best known for his presence in the Portland, Oregon wrestling scene. Professional wrestling career Barr got his start in wrestling working with Cliff Thiede from Idaho Falls, Idaho. He wrestled his first match on March 5, 1957 in Hot Springs, Idaho against Treacherous Phillips to a time limit draw. He spent his time wrestling Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Oregon and Canada. Barr began refereeing matches for Pacific Northwest Wrestling promoter Don Owen in the 1960s because it allowed him to spend more time at home with his family. As a promoter, Barr was known as a person who would take care of the wrestlers. Tom \\"The Dynamite Kid\\" Billington said of Barr, \\"The only time he made anything was once a year when all the big names came in, like Harley Race and Andr√© the Giant, and then they'd do great business. Sold out every night. Sandy would be so excited about making all this money, after he'd paid the big names, he gave the rest of it to us, the wrestlers who were there every week. All year long he'd be scraping by, and, when he did make some money, he gave it away. But he was a very good, kindhearted man, a great man‚Äîespecially for a promoter.\\" Barr spent much of his later life as a referee, promoter, and trainer, training wrestlers such as Jimmy Jack Funk (Jesse Barr), Matt Borne (the first Doink the Clown), Art Barr, Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. While largely retired from being an active wrestling performer, Barr continued to get back into the ring on occasion, wrestling his last match just a few days prior to his death. Personal life After Don Owen bought an old bowling alley and converted it into the Portland Sports Arena, Barr worked out a deal with Owen where he would hold a flea market in the arena when it was not being used for wrestling. He is the father of Art Barr, who would go on to fame in Mexico as American Love Machine, and Jesse Barr, who gained some level of fame teaming with Dory and Terry Funk as Jimmy Jack Funk. On June 2, 2007 he died of a heart attack at his flea market. Following Sandy's death, his son Josh Barr continued running the promotion until the License expired later that year. Once the license expired, the equipment was sold and the Barrs left the Wrestling business.

Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2018 municipal census, Scenic Acres had a population of living in dwellings, a 2.0% decrease from its 2017 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2018. Households in this community had a median household income of $145,685 in 2015, and there were 4.0% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2016, 22.0% of the residents were immigrants. All buildings, except for 3 sites of single-family attached houses, were single-family detached homes, and only 4.0% of the housing was used for renting. Community Association Beginning In 1985, with only about 10% of the community developed, the Community Association formed. Because the Area Structure Plan had not had 3rd reading, delayed over transportation issues, the Association worked with the Ward Alderman and the developer to create significant changes to the community design. The threshold of population for the community was moved down from 16,000 to 9,500 by upscaling lot sizes; the Community Centre site was moved from immediately north of Crowchild Twin Arenas to the interior of the community; 2 school sites were amalgamated between Scenic Acres Boulevard and Scurfield Drive, adjacent to the new Community Centre site; Scenic Acres Boulevard was re-aligned to create a significant shift to the south from its previous alignment with its connection to Stoney Trail, with the intention to prevent short-cutting; the Community Association successfully negotiated to have the site of the Nose Hill Drive LRT station moved about 200 meters to the west; a land-swap among three parties was negotiated to permit safe access/egress from LRT parking; and through public input, both the grade of Stoney Trail was lowered and the berm system built higher to reduce noise pollution from Stoney Trail.

The species was only described in 1972, and has been the subject of considerable taxonomic confusion. It was initially placed in the greenbul genus Phyllastrephus, and later with the Old World warblers in the genus Bernieria. Recent research indicates it is part of an endemic Malagasy radiation currently known as the Malagasy warblers (Cibois et al. 2001). The Appert's tetraka is around 15 cm long with a pink bill and grey legs. The plumage of the sexes is similar; the back, tail and wings are green (the wings being a darker shade), the head grey and the throat white. The flanks and belly are washed orange and the undersides are white. The species is highly terrestrial, feeding in undisturbed forest in shrubs near the ground and on the ground. Family groups of up to 8 birds, sometimes in association with other species, forage on insects gleaned from under leaves and branches. The Appert's tetraka is currently restricted to two known locations in south-west Madagascar. One is the dry deciduous forest at Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park (where the species was first discovered) and a second population in montane evergreen forest at Analavelona Classified Forest. The species is considered vulnerable due to its restricted range, particularly to habitat loss due to forest clearance. At present the Zombitse-Vohibasia forest is the subject of conservation projects that have stopped deforestation, and the Analavelona Classified Forest, while not protected, is remote and not under immediate threat. The common name and scientific name commemorate the Reverend Otto Appert a Swiss missionary in Madagascar who was also an amateur naturalist.

The island is formed of fossil- containing limestone, with some micaceous shale, named Pabba Shale. It forms a flat plateau with cliffs on the North and East shores. The surrounding low reefs encroach on its shores and double the area at low water. The island gives its name to a group of Jurassic Sedimentary rocks which are seen across the Inner Hebredian area-Pabba Shales. These were laid down at the bottom of a muddy sea 190 million years ago. Much later (about 60 million years ago) volcanicity associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean led to the intrusion of molten rock along fractures running NNW-SSE across the island. The resulting dykes now stand proud as solid sheets resembling well built masonry and protecting the island from further erosion. History Occupation of the island, in the form of midden material and lithics found in two locations, can be traced back to the prehistoric period, perhaps as far back as the Mesolithic. However, there is little evidence for settlement to bridge the gap between the Mesolithic and the sixteenth century. From this period onwards, the island is shown on maps and charts, being first named on Dutch cartographer Willem Blaeu's map of 1654. Dean Monro in 1549 gave the following description: > At the shore of Skye foresaid, lies an isle called Pabay, near one mile in > length, full of woods, good for fishing, and a main shelter for thieves and > cut-throats, it pertains to Mackinnon.Monro, Donald (High Dean of the > Isles), Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (William Auld, > Edinburgh, 1774), at page 26 (Google Books, accessed on 13 July 2010) In the 18th century, Scottish author Martin Martin provided the following description of the island in his seminal work A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland: \\"A League further North lies the Isle Pabhay, about two Miles in Circumference, it excels in Pasturage, the Cows in it afford near double the Milk that they yield in Skie. In the Dog Days there is a big Flye in this Isle, which infests the Cows, makes them run up and down, discomposes them exceedingly, and hinders their Feeding, insomuch that they must be brought out of the Isle, to the Isle of Skie ; this Isle affords abundance of Lobsters, Limpets, Wilks, Crabs, and ordinary Sea Plants\\"\\" Pabay was described by Hugh Miller, the early Victorian and missionary as \\"the only piece of flat, level England in the entire landscape\\" (of Skye). Ruins of a chapel exist on the island. It is not certain to what saint the church was dedicated. Of it nothing exists but the foundations its external length was only 21 feet. There is difficulty in determining the precise limits of the burying-ground, but it seems to have included two other buildings, the most preserved of which is a curious semicircular structure rudely and somewhat irregularly formed of uncemented stones of large size, and measuring 9 feet from north to south, and 6 from east to west. In local speech it is the Altar, but whether of Christian or Pagan dedication, no one presumes to know. In the centre of it is an irregular circle of stones, smaller than those without, and on the south the enclosing wall of the outer building is formed lengthways of two large oblong blocks, placed a little asunder at the middle so as to leave an entrance-way between. There is now a single occupied farm on the west side of the island, which has been in existence since at least the 1860s. The jetty, which first appears on the OS Second edition map (1904), lies at the south-western corner of the island; it is also possible to anchor off this point, while the beacon Sgeir Gobhlach appears on the First edition map (1882). A cluster of roofed and unroofed buildings is shown at the head of the jetty on the OS First edition map (1882), while a sheep pen is depicted on the current edition in this location. It issues its own postage stamps. Flora and Fauna Pabay consists of heath, dry grassland, herb marsh, salt marsh, woodland remnants and 75 acres of newly planted deciduous and coniferous trees, containing 17 different species. There are 32 different species of wild flowers, 49 different herbs, 40 different grasses, sedges, ferns and rushes. There are also numerous resident otters, seals, 32 breeding bird species and 72 non- breeding birds. There is also a large rabbit population and a smaller population of shrews.

In December 2007 Viz began releasing the series under the name Wild Ones and under the Shojo Beat label in America. A preview of the manga series was seen in the November 2007 issue of Shojo Beat. Story After recently losing her mother, Sachie Wakamura is suddenly greeted by her maternal grandfather, whom she has never met, who offers to let her live with him. She soon discovers that her grandfather is a less than ordinary man: he is a head of a yakuza gang. To help her adjust to her new home, she is assigned a bodyguard, the handsome and protective Rakuto Igarashi. While struggling to keep all this hidden from her classmates, Sachie attempts to graduate from high school and lead a normal life. Main characters =Sachie Wakamura= Sachie is the 15-year-old (who later turns 16 in the earlier chapters) protagonist of the story. She has a strong sense of justice and dislikes deceit. Her stubborn nature makes Rakuto's job all the more challenging. Her father died a long time ago and with the recent death of her mother, Sachie finds she has nowhere to live until her grandfather appears and takes her in. She begins to adjust to having the head of a yakuza gang as her grandfather and living in a house full of hoodlums. It seems she has inherited yakuza blood; she can be very scary when she is mad. Her favorite food is hamburger with egg in it. Because of Rakuto, her classmates think she's a princess (she's a princess, but of yakuza). Everyone in the yakuza is very protective of Sachie, and are prepared to protect her with their life. Throughout the series, she's seen fighting the urge to fall in love with Rakuto, though unsuccessfully. Sachie has an 86% compatibility chance with Azuma. She and Rakuto have a 99% compatibility chance, but Rakuto is unaware. When a girl from another yakuza gang falls in love with Rakuto and has Rakuto as her caretaker for a while, (because Sachie caused Midori's original caretaker, Kotaro, to catch a cold) Sachie is shown to be annoyed at the fact that Rakuto didn't get mad at Midori like he does to Sachie. =Rakuto Igarashi= Rakuto is Sachie's bodyguard. Handsome and heroic, he is the most popular guy in school and is the student council president. No one at school suspects that he belongs to a yakuza gang, in part because he acts like a prince, and was considered one until he refers to Sachie as a \\"princess\\" and that he is her bodyguard in order to remove any suspicion that they are associated with yakuza. His father, Iga, had a serious gambling debt when Rakuto was little, and his mother left him. Afterwards, Asagi took him in. Rakuto is very loyal to Sachie, to the point of being over protective. He had met Sachie and her mother when she was 5 years old, and her smiling face attracted him. He already seemed to have feelings for her since then. It is also proven that he can be quite jealous, as when the new cute student Azuma asked Sachie to dance, he whisked her away before the dance began, on the story that she had sprained her leg. Later, when Sachie questions him about it, he asks her to dance with him alone. He and Azuma have a 100% compatibility chance. Rakuto and Sachie have a 99% compatibility chance, although only Sachie knows. At one point Rakuto has to be the caretaker of a girl from a different yakuza gang, and he was really grumpy when Sachie ignored him. It is believed that Rakuto, in middle school, was the leader of his school's gang. =Azuma Inui= Azuma's grandfather is a friend of Sachie's grandfather. Azuma moves into Raizo's house when his grandfather is in the hospital. Shortly after moving into Raizo's home, he transfers into the same school as Sachie and Rakuto. Like Rakuto, he is very popular with the girls at his school. Azuma has been shown to have feelings for Sachie, but his attempts have been failures. In chapter 6, Sachie and Rakuto are shown to have a 99% compatibility chance, and Azuma and Sachie have 86%. Azuma and Rakuto treat each other as rivals. =Raizo Asagi= Asagi is Sachie's grandfather, and the head of a yakuza gang. The kanji character for \\"Rai\\" in his name, Raizo, means thunder bolt in Japanese. He is a man of integrity and honor. Everyone in his gang is devoted to him, since many people who he has taken in are those who have nowhere else to go. His favorite food is hamburger with egg in it. He keeps his daughter Yukie's room untouched, and punishes whoever goes in it severely. When his daughter decided to leave his home, he told her that she would no longer be an Asagi, and would be dead to him. When he heard his daughter was dead and left a granddaughter, he decided to take her in. One of his hand is missing a pinky. (Yubitsume refers to finger-cutting. Among the yakuza, the cutting of one's pinky serves as form of penance or apology) =Yukie Wakamura= Deceased mother of Sachie and daughter of Asagi. She left her father's home and thus broke all ties with him and the name Asagi. Even when she had Sachie, she did not contact Asagi, but told Sachie all her family was dead. Yukie hated all things deceitful. She hated to waste food which she told Sachie never to do. She was strong, kind, and full of love. Her specialty was cooking hamburgers with egg in it. Her room in Asagi's house remains untouched since the day she left. Yukie seems to have been killed by being hit by a car. Like Sachie, she had a bodyguard named Jin Aso who appears to have had feelings for her and had kidnapped Sachie in order to see if Rakuto was a capable bodyguard.

Starring Peter Boyle as a weary and embittered New York City Police Department beat cop, it was created by veteran TV producer Danny Arnold following his successful New York City police detective sitcom Barney Miller. The production company was Tetagram Ltd., with Arnold and Chris Hayward serving as the show's executive producers. All six episodes were written by the team of Arnold, Hayward and Philip Jayson Lasker, with Arnold directing all but the fifth episode, which was directed by John Florea. Synopsis A darkly urban comedy-drama shot without a studio audience or laugh track, the series starred Peter Boyle as a veteran, semi-corrupt cop marking time until retirement, and Andrew Rubin as his naive rookie partner, Officer Willie Smith. Series creator Danny Arnold described the lead character as \\"a beat patrolman with thirty years on the force. He's become so completely disillusioned and such a terrible cynic that he's written off the world.\\" In recurring roles were DeLane Matthews as streetwalker Lorna, the only person with whom the misanthropic Bash could be even somewhat close; Val Bisoglio as Sgt. Carmine DiSalvo; Michael Cavanaugh as Lt. Pendleton; and Larry Hankin as diner-owner Stu. It was set in the 33rd Precinct in Manhattan, represented via a deliberately theatrical set reminiscent of a stage play. As Arnold described it, \\"The show came out to be sort of strange. ... ABC said, 'What kind of show is this? We don't know how to sell it.' ... 'Joe Bash' is not a situation comedy and it's not a drama. It's a behavioral comedy, a comedy whose roots are in drama.\\" He chose the name \\"Bash\\" because it \\"sounded like an aggressive hitter, a victim who is striking back and totally cynical because he's accomplished nothing in his life.\\" Reception Joe Bash won positive notices from critics. Time placed the series on the magazine's 1986 best-of list, calling it \\"a moody tragicomedy on loneliness. Peter Boyle was outstanding as a grumpy cop in this undeservedly short-lived series\\". In an earlier review, the magazine remarked on how the two lead characters would \\"traverse the desolate city streets and cope with the unglamorous trivia of everyday police life. ... In Boyle's sharp and unsentimental portrayal, crustiness never becomes cute, and there are echoes of authentic urban despair in the patter\\". The New York Times wrote favorably that, \\"There is no laugh track to signal the viewer as to whether Joe's misanthropy is really supposed to be funny. Joe Bash moves to its own special beat, apparently bent on demolishing every well- established clich√© in sitcom territory\\". Lee Margulies of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the show is \\"not entertaining in the usual TV sense, but the intriguing premise and the captivating performance by Boyle nevertheless leave one interested in tuning in again\\".

She was the first among the women writers in Bengal to gain prominence.Banerjee, Hiranmay, Thakurbarir Katha, , p. 119, Sishu Sahitya Sansad. Family and early life She was the fourth amongst the daughters of Debendranath Tagore and was a granddaughter of Dwarkanath Tagore. Three of her sisters, Soudamini, Sukumari and Saratkumari, were older than she was. Barnakumari was the youngest sister. Soudamini was one of the earliest students of Bethune School. Others in the Tagore family had followed her, but it seems that Swarnakumari had her education primarily at home. She was five years older than Rabindranath Tagore. Education was valued in the Jorasanko Thakur Bari. Swarnakumari recalled how, when her father Debendranath learned that the governess was writing something on a slate and having the girls copy it, he stopped the mechanical practice and brought in a better teacher. In his memoirs Rabindranath wrote, \\"We learnt much more at home than we had to at school.\\" Swarnakumari had a great capability of picking up friendship with other girls from an early age. As per the custom of the day, each pair of friends had a common name, which they used to call each other. Swarnakumari had many friends ‚Äì Mistihasi, Milan, Bihangini and so on. Marriage and children She was married in 1868, to Janakinath Ghosal, a well-educated and strong-willed young man belonging to a landlord family of Nadia district. Janakinath Ghosal was disowned by his family for adopting Brahmoism and marrying under controversial anusthanic Brahmo rites whose validity was then disputedGhoshal was 1 of 9 such grooms who petitioned for Brahmo Marriage Bill 1871 to Sir Henry Maine. per Sibnath Sastri and consequently deprived of all inheritance. However, with his capabilities and determination he succeeded in business and developed his own zamindari. He was endowed with the title of Raja. He was a theosophist and was actively associated with the Indian National Congress from its earliest days. According to his daughter, Hironmoyee Devi, he nurtured the young organisation as a gardener nurtures a sapling.Devi Choudhurani, Indira, Smritisamput, Notes, p. 190. Janakinath Ghosal was one of the founders of Indian National Congress. Their children were Hiranmoyee Devi (1870 ‚Äì 1925),Devi Choudhurani, Indira, Smritisamput, Notes, p. 218. Jyotsnanath Ghosal (1871 ‚Äì 1962) and Sarala Devi Chaudhurani (1872 ‚Äì 1945).Banerjee, Hiranmay, Thakurbarir Katha, family chart, p. 224. Jyotsnanath Ghosal qualified for the ICS and served in Western India.Devi Choudhurani, Indira, Smritisamput, Notes, p. 195. Creative efforts The efforts of the male members of the Tagore family in the field of music, theatre and writing must have penetrated into the inner precincts of the Jorasanko Thakur Bari and touched a chord in Swarnakumari. When Jyotirindranath Tagore was involved with his experiments in music, plays and writing, he was assisted by Akshay Chandra Chaudhuri and Rabindranath. In his Jyotirindrasmriti (Reminiscence) he wrote, \\"With Janaki going to England and arrival of my younger sister Swarnakumari in our house, we got another partner in our literary ventures.\\" While Gyanadanandini Devi took the lead for breaking down age-old restrictions on women in the house, Swarnakumari flourished in creativity. =First novel= Her first novel Deepnirban was published in 1876. There is an opinion that Hana Catherine Mullens was the first novelist in the Bengali language with her Phoolmani O Karunar Bibaran published in 1852;Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, p. 423 Swarnakumari was the first woman novelist amongst the Bengali people.Bandopadhyay, Brajendranath, Sahitye Banga Mahila , in Bethune College and School Centenary Volume, edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949, p. 199 Deepnirban assisted in rousing the national spirit. Thereafter she wrote extensively ‚Äì novels, plays, poems and scientific essays. She was keen on developing scientific terminology in Bengali. She composed numerous songs. According to comparatist Swapan Majumdar, the rise of woman writers such as Swarnakumari and Kamini Roy was exceptionally important. They \\"represented a flourishing generation of educated women writers, discharging with total zeal the responsibilities of their pursuit\\". In 1879, Swarnakumari composed what was possibly the first opera written in Bengali, Basanta Utsav. =Bharati= Bharati was a family magazine started by Jyotirindranath Tagore in 1877 and edited first by Dwijendranath Tagore.Banerjee, Hiranmay, p. 139-140. Dwijendranath edited the magazine for seven years. Thereafter for eleven years, Swarnakumari took charge as editor and worked hard to enhance the uniqueness of the journal. Her daughters edited it for twelve years and Rabindranath edited it for a year. It was then back to her for another eight years. Again after a nine-year gap, it was back to her. She edited it for nearly two years and finally closed it after being in print for half a century. Rabindranath was only sixteen years old when Bharati was first published. He started contributing to the magazine from the first issue. Indeed, the demands of the magazine enforced certain regularity in Rabindranath's writing and over the years he contributed enormously to it. Political activity As her husband was secretary of the Indian National Congress, she was actively involved in politics. In 1889 and 1890 she served Indian National Congress. That was the first time women participated publicly in the sessions of the Indian National Congress.Bagal, Jogesh Chandra, Rashtriya Andolane Banga Mahila, , in Bethune College and School Centenary Volume, edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949, p. 228 Sakhi Samiti Sakhi Samiti (Society of Friends) was started by Swarnakumari in 1896. With her were associated other members of the Tagore family. The objective of the society was to assist helpless orphans and widows. The following report was published in Bharati and Balak in 1898: : \\"The first aim of the Samiti is to help helpless orphans and widows. This will be done in two ways. In those cases where such widows and orphans have no near relations or if those relations have not the means of maintaining them the Sakhi Samiti will take their full responsibility. In other cases the Samiti will give them help as far as possible. In the case of those women whose full responsibility the Samiti will take they will educate them and through them spread women‚Äôs education. After they have finished their education they will take up the work of zenana (female) education. The Samiti will give them remuneration for their work. In this way two objectives will be accomplished. Hindu widows will be able to earn through service to others according to sanction of Hindu religion.\\"Ghose, Lotika, Social and Educational Movements for Women and By Women 1820-1950, in Bethune College and School Centenary Volume, edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949, p. 148 As the subscriptions from members were not sufficient to run the organisation, an annual exhibition was held in Bethune College to raise funds. Apart from saris from Dhaka and Santipur and handicrafts from Krishnanagar and Birbhum, there used to be a large collection of handicrafts from outside Bengal ‚Äì Kashmir, Moradabad, Varanasi, Agra, Jaipur and Mumbai. Her objective was to display indigenous products and sell them. The fair created a sensation in her days. The activities of Sakhi Samaiti continued till around 1906 and thereafter taken over by Hiranmoyee Bidhaba Ashram. The widows‚Äô home started by Sashipada Banerjee at Baranagore, considered the first such venture, inspired Hiranmoyee Devi, the daughter of Swarnakuamri, to start the Mahila Bidhaba Ashram (that was named after her subsequent to her death). Among the members of the executive committee of the Mahila Vidhaba Ashram in its inaugural year were: Swarnakumari, Maharani Sucharu Devi of Mayurbhanj, Maharani Suniti Devi of Cooch Behar (the two daughters of Keshub Chunder Sen), Lady Hamilton, Priyamvada Devi, Mrs. Chapman, Mrs. S.P. Sinha, and Hiranmoyee Devi, who served as secretary. ‚ÄòIt is still running quite efficiently‚Äô (in 1949) with Kalyani Mallick, the daughter of Hiranmoyee Devi guiding the affairs of the institution. The society was christened \\"Sakhi Samiti\\" by Rabindranath. At the request of Sarala Roy, Rabindranath wrote a dance drama Mayar Khela to be staged by Sakhi Samiti for fund raising.

According to the liner notes of the Demon Records CD the group claimed a wide range of influences including the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Frank Zappa, Syd Barrett, Robin Williamson, the Marx Brothers, Flanders and Swann, Bing Crosby, Tom Lehrer, Gilbert and Sullivan, Frederick Delius, J. S. Bach and Igor Stravinsky. \\"Dora the Female Explorer\\" and \\"Slark\\" were both issued as singles from the album. Recording The album was recorded on 16-track equipment at De Lane Lea Studios, London, between March and April 1971 with recording engineer Martin Birch. It was produced by Fritz Freyer. Deep Purple were in the studio next door working on their album Fireball. The album contains the original 14-minute version of \\"Slark\\" which was later re-recorded in a much shorter version for a single. \\"Slark\\" was the highlight of many Stackridge concerts, combining as it did folk and progressive rock elements.

The speedway was home to several drivers who went on to become Australian national and state champions. Tralee (for a time also known as Fraser Park Raceway and later the Pepsi Power Dome) was a dirt surfaced oval raceway. History Tralee Speedway opened in 1970 and was a \\"D\\" shaped oval made of a dolomite and clay mix. Many types of cars raced at Tralee - super modifieds, Sprintcars, Speedcars, three quarter midgets (TQs, later to be named Formula 500s), stock cars, Solos, Sidecars, and productions sedans. During the 1970s, Tralee Speedway was best known for its high quality production sedan racing, producing several national and state champions in this category including Australian champions David House (2 x Australian champion), Dave Wignall and Brian \\"Stormin\\" Norman. The speedway holds the distinction of hosting the first ever Australian Super Sedan Championship in 1971-72, won by Kevin Dalton of Victoria from Alan Butcher of Queensland and David House. In 1974, Tralee staged the Australian Modified Sprintcar Championship. The event was won by Jim Winterbottom (father of V8 Supercars driver Mark Winterbottom) from Victoria's Les Harrower and Ron Smith. By 1979, the title was renamed the Australian Sprintcar Championship and in 1982 was once again held at Tralee Speedway. Legendary Australian Sprintcar driver Garry Rush won the 4th of his 10 national titles from Bob Kelly (Qld) and Ian Samms (NSW). Tralee hosted its final Australian Sprintcar Championship in 1989, With Garry Rush again victorious, winning his 8th national crown from defending champion George Tatnell (NSW) and 1987 national champion Brett Lacey from Victoria. Many well known drivers from the Liverpool Speedway in Sydney also raced at Tralee including sedan aces Peter Graham, Peter Crick, Bruce Maxwell, Brian Callaghan, Rick Hunter, and super modified stars Gary Rush, Dick Britton, Jim Winterbottom, Steve Brazier, George Tatnell and Sid Hopping. Other notable drivers from this era include Peter Taunton, Howard Revell, brothers Bob and Harry Bink, Ron Shepherd, Bob Rawlings, Max Kennerly, Ken Barlow, John Lange, Roger Emerton, John Forman, Bill Martin (from Cooma) and Bill Martin (from Goulburn). The USA Sedan teams returned to race for many seasons at Tralee and the \\"USA vs. Australia\\" battles were popular with race fans. Another popular visitor was American Sprintcar great Gary Patterson (promoted in Australia as \\"The Hostile Hippy\\"), who proved to be unbeatable on nearly every occasion. Other US stars to race at Tralee were Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford, 1975 and 1976 USAC National Midget Champion Ron \\"Sleepy\\" Tripp, Larry Rice, and Mel Kenyon. Three time Speedway World Champion Ole Olsen from Denmark was a visitor to the speedway. Mike Clyne's Ford Mustang racing down main straight at Tralee =Bitumen and back to Clay= In the 1974 the track was surfaced with bitumen. This changed the nature of the racing, producing faster lap speeds but less exciting racing. It also restricted the classes of racing that could be held at the speedway, and a motorcycle track was built into the infield so that bikes were still able to run at the speedway. With crowds not as big as hoped, the bitumen was dug up after the 1977/78 season and the track reverted to a clay surface, suitable for cars but still not for bikes which still used the infield track until that was removed in 1980. Following the removal of the infield track, bikes raced on the main track. To coincide with the change in track surface in 1974, Tralee Speedway was renamed as the Fraser Park Raceway. The Speedway hosted the ACT Solo Championship on occasions during the 1980s. Future Australian Solo Champion and 1990 World Finalist Todd Wiltshire won his first senior Speedway championships winning the ACT title in 1987 and 1988 at Tralee. Tralee Speedway also hosted the Australian Formula 500 Championship in both 1979 and 1988. The 1979 event was won by William Broadwood of Western Australia, while NSW driver Lloyd Thorley won his 3rd and last national title at the speedway in 1988. The Southern corner at Tralee As a result of many washed out nights due to unseasonable rain and noise restrictions imposed after constant complaints from nearby Hume residents, the track closed in 1997. Future Today, Tralee Speedway complex is long closed and will be part of a new suburban development. Speedway in Canberra is now held at the ACT Speedway located south east of the Canberra Airport in Fairbairn, though unlike Tralee the ACT Speedway rarely hosts national championship meetings.

It is the oldest dogsled race in the United States.Famous Firsts, Natalie Rompella 2007, page 15, the All Alaska Sweepstakes was held in Alaska which was only a territory in 1917 and not part of the United States. The first American Dog Derby was held in 1917. It was tremendously popular in the 1920s through the 1950s. Interest waned in the 1960s and the race was discontinued for several years. It was revived in 1993 and continues to grow in popularity. History =First American Dog Derby= The dog sledding tradition in Ashton owes its existence to Union Pacific Railroad. Ashton was founded and constructed with the coming of railroad in 1906. The construction of the Yellowstone Branch continued from Ashton into the high country of Island Park and completed at West Yellowstone in 1908. A few years later, the Teton Valley Branch, was constructed from Ashton into the Lamont and Teton Valley areas and completed to Victor in 1912. Due to the deep snows, however, these two railroads were closed down in winter and not plowed until spring. This made Ashton the wintertime rail terminus for the entire region. In winter, mail, people, and supplies could only be transported to developments in these high country areas via dog sled. By 1917, mushing, in Ashton, was a serious business with dozens carving out a living training and maintaining dog sled teams that transported mail, people, and supplies to the high country in winter. The idea for the first dog sled race has a traditional history that a popular barber in Ashton, named Jay Ball, dreamed it up after reading about the All-Alaska Sweepstakes in Nome, Alaska and the new Hudson Bay Dog Derby in Las Pas, Manitoba, Canada that began the year before in 1916. Two of the four founders of the American Dog Derby were direct employees of Union Pacific Railroad and that Union Pacific spent tens of thousands of dollars promoting the American Dog Derby over the following decades and made it a wildly popular international event and made several mushers international celebrities. A popular female musher named Lydia Hutchinson even starred in a movie. The rules for the American Dog Derby would be based on those of the Hudson Bay Dog Derby, the course would be the unplowed Yellowstone Branch railroad from West Yellowstone to Ashton, and the date would be Sunday, March 4, 1917. Promoters must have been pleased when 16 teams registered in Ashton between February 25 and March 1 for the first big race. All were local. There were two teams from Harriman‚Äôs Railroad Ranch, one team from the Utida Gun Club, one from the Trude Ranch, several from West Yellowstone, one team from Henry‚Äôs Lake, one team from Kilgore, one team from Spencer, two from Marysville, one team from the Mesa Hunting Lodge, and several teams from Ashton. It looked to be a grand affair. Tud Kent in deeps snows of Island Park in 1918 with same team he used to win in 1917. Photo illustrates problems of deep snow in Island Park The heavy snows started falling in Island Park the beginning of March. Between 20 and 40 inches of fresh snow fell by the 3rd. It was deep and soft enough that only four teams were able to make their way through Island Park to the starting point at West Yellowstone. In spite of the elimination of 12 of the 16 entrants, things went well, Sunday morning, for the remaining four teams at the start of this 55-mile run down to Ashton. It was still snowing, however, and at 8 miles, assenting to Rea‚Äôs Pass on the Continental Divide, the teams encountered 20 more inches of new light powdery snow. They took turns at breaking trail. At 14 miles and entering Island Park near Big Springs, the winds began to blow and the snow storm became a blizzard. The mushing became even slower and more exhausting but the four teams pushed on through the flat Island Park country all day in the blizzard. With fading daylight, the teams realized that an exciting finish before a cheering crowd was not to be. They finally holed up for the night at a fish hatchery on Warm River at the 40 mile mark. Start of Boys Race with each team consisting of one boy, one sleigh, and one dog. 15 Dogs in One Big Fight and 15 Boys Trying to Untangle Them. Meanwhile, in Ashton, the spectators waiting for them in the milder climes of the valley were having a pretty good time. It was described as a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù crowd by the papers but the numbers were tiny when compared to those of following years. They watched or participated in the many other events of the American Dog Derby such as ski races, ski jumping, and a 200-yard boy‚Äôs dog sled race. Each ‚Äúteam‚Äù in the Boy‚Äôs Race consisted of one boy, one sled, and one dog. There were 15 teams, and at one point, it was reported, all 15 dogs were in one big fight with all 15 boys trying to untangle them. It was all great fun and, though going home and not seeing the big race finish, most spectators had a wonderful time and would be back the following year. Next morning, the four stranded teams at the fish hatchery raced down the Warm River grade, into the valley, and ran the final few miles into Ashton. Tud Kent, one of the four original organizers, racing for Harriman‚Äôs Railroad Ranch, was the first winner of the American Dog Derby, winning by over 20 minutes. He did this while breaking trail and would go on to win five more Dog Derbies for a total of six. This was more wins than any other musher. Tud Kent (standing behind sleigh) and his dog team after winning the first American Dog Derby amid a deserted Main Street as mushers did not arrive until the Monday morning after the race day. The race was promoted and held again the following year but in a figure-eight course in the valley around Ashton where 40 inch snowfalls are less common. By the early 1920s, the American Dog Derby attracted crowds estimated at 10 to 15 thousand and had officially displaced the All-Alaska Sweepstakes as the American Championship race. In fact, the All-Alaska Sweepstakes held its last race in 1919 making the American Dog Derby the oldest surviving American dog sled race. The American Dog Derby became so internationally popular, it would be considered the World Championship in dog sled racing. The prize money growing to $1000 in the 1920s would be equivalent to $130,000 today. With the wild success, the glamour, and the international press coverage of the American Dog Derby, dog sledding was popularized and dozens of other dog sled races soon sprang up across America, Canada, and in Europe making dog sled racing what it is today.

The episode was written by Kate Robin and was directed by Rose Troche. It first aired on March 17, 2002. The episode features a parody of the program used by est and The Forum.  Plot summary  The episode begins with the death of Michael John Piper, whose wife is a psychic. As he dies, Mrs. Piper states that she can see a light emanating from above his head. Nate begins to experience muscular twitching and loss of verbal skills, which after some internet research David determines to be a condition known as AVM. Later, as Mrs. Piper is selecting a casket for the funeral assisted by David, she informs him that she is being advised by her late husband. In a scene in the kitchen, Ruth comes downstairs and informs Nate, David and Claire that she will be attending a self-improvement seminar called \\"The Plan\\". Her friend Robbie had urged her to attend the course. Claire is worried that \\"The Plan\\" is some kind of cult, and Nate remarks that it must be \\"one of those self- actualization things from the '70s where they yell at you for twelve hours and don't let you go to the bathroom\\". Upon arrival at the seminar, the leader begins to use jargon and metaphor which compares a \\"blueprint\\" for home renovation to self-improvement of one's life. She singles out Ruth and berates her for \\"tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up\\". Claire attends a counseling session at school, and David brings Nate to the Independent Funeral Directors lunch, where Nate proceeds to rant about the evils of corporations as related to their industry. Claire later returns to the counselor's office, where a police detective questions her about her boyfriend Gabe's involvement in a convenience store robbery, and Claire is angry with her counselor for breaking their trust. Brenda and Nate have a conversation about college-life while she is selecting courses for her adult education, and the conversation leads to Brenda's current lack of interest in sex. Brenda later decides to leave the genetics class she had enrolled in, after getting in a public argument with the instructor. Ruth comes home late at night from her seminar, and finds Claire waiting for her on the couch. Ruth mentions that she will be attending more seminars of \\"The Plan\\" because she has already paid for the coursework and does not want to appear rude. Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversation with Claire, and then Ruth complains that she cannot yet go to sleep for she must first do \\"homework\\" from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for \\"all the terrible things she did to me\\", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will \\"renovate\\" her life. As Nate prepares for the funeral, his father Nathaniel visits him, and they discuss philosophical opinions regarding death and the afterlife. A poem by Walt Whitman is read aloud at the funeral. After the funeral Claire requests assistance from Nate, but David interrupts them with follow-up news from their Independent Funeral Directors meeting. Keith and his mother have a heated discussion about the care of Taylor, and the neglected responsibilities of his sister Carla. Brenda flirts with a patron at a bar, and he gives her his business card moments before Nate arrives to meet her. At \\"The Plan\\", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to \\"renovate their homes\\" together. Robbie goads Ruth into calling a family member, but she fakes a conversation with Claire while listening to an automated message. Later, Gabe calls Claire, and asks her to come meet him. Nate and Brenda have dinner together, where she tells him of her academic experience and he discusses concepts of death with her. In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for \\"knocking down her old house\\", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house. Ruth and Robbie then hang out at a bar where they flirt and Ruth asserts herself in conversation. While driving Gabe, Claire witnesses him shoot at another car while they are stopped, but does not see if he has hit anyone. Claire later grabs Gabe's gun, and leaves him to go seek help from Keith. Keith questions Claire in a supportive tone, while Nate and David are more concerned. However, Keith explains to them that Claire was conflicted due to her love for Gabe.

Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: \\"Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles\\". She writes that: \\"..the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides\\". However, she also points out that Ruth's rant at the end of her seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: \\"So, what do we make of our times when all this supposed nonsense actually works?\\" Donald Kummings cites the episode in his A Companion to Walt Whitman, while analyzing the effect of a poem by Walt Whitman on a grieving family. Walt Whitman had been character Michael John Piper's favorite poet. Kummings notes \\"The facial expression of the bereaved wife indicates that she is pleased and consoled by these lines\\". Kummings also makes mention of the psychic theme that runs throughout the episode, noting: \\"Indeed psychic connection with the dead is an ongoing motif here, since both funeral director brothers communicate with their father during the episode\\". The episode is also analyzed in Marriner's Finding the Open Road: A Guide to Self-construction Rather Than Mass Production.

In 2008, a group of 30 lion-tailed macaques were sighted during the annual census, but in the 2009 census more than 45 lion-tailed macaques, including a sizeable number of young macaques, were sighted in a single group between Nagariyar and Periyakavu patch. Nilgiri Tahr have been sighted in the entire division starting from Kottamala in Rajapalayam to Perumal Malai in Sathuragiri Hills near Sundara Mahalingam temple in Saptoor. A tiger was also seen in Sathuragiri during the 2009 census. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the population of the tahrs with the census in 2011 putting their numbers at 220 individuals. Recognised as an Important Bird Area, over 275 species of birds are seen in this sanctuary including 14 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats, such as the critically endangered Oriental white-backed vulture and the long-billed vulture, vulnerable species Nilgiri wood-pigeon, broad-tailed grass warbler, red-faced malkoha and the white-bellied shortwing (Brachypteryx major) and near threatened species like the great pied hornbill, Nilgiri pipit, black- and-orange flycatcher and the Nilgiri flycatcher. The Malayan night heron is of lesser concern. The primary raptors here are the serpent eagle, hawks and black eagle. A bird survey in 2013 observed in the sanctuary rare endemic species including Sri Lankan frogmouth, mountain and rufous-bellied hawk- eagles, great Indian and Malabar pied hornbills, mountain and green imperial pigeons which are all species found only in the higher altitudes of Western Ghats. Some of the rare migratory birds spotted included the steppe eagle, Eurasian sparrowhawk and bluecapped rockthrush. The sanctuary has numerous reptiles including king cobras, Indian rock python and many endemic species namely pit vipers, ornate flying snake, Draco or gliding lizard, large-scaled calotes and Monilesaurus ellioti and amphibians including endemic ones like Micrixalus, Indirana, Nyctibatrachus, Ramanella, Rhacophorus malabaricus, Raorchestes and Pseudophilautus.

The sanctuary has one Medicinal Plant Conservation Area (MPCA) located at Thaniparai. 69 plant species belonging to 58 taxa and 42 families are used by the Paliyar tribal people, living in the sanctuary, to treat 15 ailments. Conservation The conservation problems affecting the sanctuary are human- elephant conflict, human encroachment, cattle grazing and forest fire. Within the sanctuary, there are 7 to 10 temples which attract thousands of pilgrims every year. Water scarcity is a major problem during dry season due to lack of perennial water source. Measures have been taken to conserve the wildlife in the sanctuary. The entry of cattle into the sanctuary is prevented, particularly in Kottamalai and Watrap. Leases for collection of fruits and minor forest produce have been stopped to increase the food sources. Tree planting, soil conservation and water harvesting have been undertaken to improve the habitat. The possibility of an elephant corridor could be studied by tracking elephants using radio collars.Srivilliputhur Wildlife Sanctuary Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, Retrieved 5/12/2007 Accessibility The sanctuary is 45 km away from Virudhunagar town and about 75‚Äì80 km away from Madurai city.

She was a leader of zenana missions, setting up schools for girls and writing what is arguably the first novel in Bengali. She spent most of her life in Calcutta, then the capital of British India (now Kolkata, West Bengal), and was fluent in the Bengali language. Early life and education Hana Catherine Lacroix was born in Calcutta. Her father was Alphonse Fran√ßois Lacroix, a Swiss Protestant missionary who went to Chinsurah in 1821 to preach Christianity on behalf of the London Missionary Society (LMS). Her mother, Hannah Herklots, was from a Dutch colonial family. Hana grew up in the mission in Bhowanipore, one of the Dihi Panchannagram villages then on the suburbs of the capital of the Raj. She learned Bengali, the language of her amah and other servants, at a period when Sanskrit was used only for liturgical and religious purposes; and Bengali was only a language of conversation. At the age of 12 she started teaching Bengali in a newly established school. She was educated mostly by her parents until the family travelled back to Europe when she was 15. Living in London gave her the opportunity to study at the Home and Colonial School Society, where she trained to be a teacher, and then returned to Calcutta. Career =Educator= In 1845, she married Joseph Mullens also of the LMS, who had travelled out to India on the same ship as her father. The missionary couple continued their work in Calcutta for a dozen years. Using her fluency in Bengali, Hana Catherine Mullens was head of a girls' boarding school, and taught Bible classes to women. It was at the invitation of Rev. Mullens, chairing the Bengal Missionary Conference of 1855, that Rev. John Fordyce first reported on his female teaching initiative in the zenana. (The word refers to the secluded living quarters of girls and women, similar to purdah.) Hana Catherine Mullens became known for her devotion to the outreach programme of the zenana missions. Shortly after the conference, she persuaded the widow of a Hindu doctor to accommodate zenana teaching in her home, and then negotiated other similar arrangements.Emma Raymond Pitman, India Zenana Missions (London: John Snow & Co., 1903), pp. 20-21. These Indian Christians were known as Bible women. In 1858, she and her husband visited Britain to spread the word about their missionary work in India. By the time of her death in 1861, she had four zenanas under her care and was visiting a further eleven every afternoon.Robert A. Bickers and Rosemary Seton, eds, Missionary Encounters: Sources and Issues (Richmond: Curzon Press, 1996), pp. 51‚Äì52. =Writer= She is credited by some with having written the first novel in the Bengali language, Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran (Description of Phulmani and Karuna), in 1852.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), (1976/1998), Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , p 423, . It was aimed at native Christian women. This book was published six years before Peary Chand Mitra published his Alaler Gharer Dulal. There are other claimants to earlier novels. Nabababubilas published by Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay in 1825 is claimed as one but others think of it as being merely a story.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali, pp. 374-375. Similar reservation has also been expressed about Phulmani O Karunar Bibaran.Bandopadhyay, Brajendranath, Sahitye Banga Mahila, in Bethune College and School Centenary Volume, edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949, p. 196 The first Bengali woman to write a novel was Swarnakumari Devi, with her Deepnirban in 1876.Banerjee, Hiranmay, Thakurbarir Katha, , p. 119, Sishu Sahitya Sansad. Mullens wrote another book, The Missionary on the Ganges or What is Christianity, in both English and Bengali. She translated Charlotte Maria Tucker's Daybreak in Britain into Bengali.

History Environment California was formed by the California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) in 2003 to take over its environmental work. Environment California supported and campaigned for the Million Solar Roofs Bill in 2006 and the Global Warming Solutions Act in 2007.Million Solar Roofs - Environment California Structure and canvassing efforts Environment California works with the Fund for the Public Interest (FFPIR or \\"the Fund\\") to recruit members to the organization and run campaigns across the state of California through canvassing offices. FFPIR runs canvassing offices in partnership with Environment California to raise money and build citizen support for the group. However, Environment California fires canvassing officers if they don't meet a certain \\"quota\\" for the week.Fund for the Public Interest Bernadette Del Chiaro, the director of Environment California's Clean Energy Program, defended the political value of the group's door-to-door and street fundraising in an official website launched in September 2006. The website was created solely to respond to people's criticism of the organization's methods. She states that, in her experience, this type of canvassing ‚Äúabsolutely elevated the issue in terms of public awareness, which, in turn, made it clearer to decision-makers that they needed to act‚Äù.Canvassing Works: Bernadette Del Chiaro, Environment California, Energy Advocate In a contrasting viewpoint, the book Activism, Inc. by Columbia University sociologist Dana Fisher, says this particular fundraising model mistreats idealistic young people by using them as interchangeable parts and providing them with insufficient training.Fisher, Dana R. 2006. Activism, Inc. How the Outsourcing of Grassroots Campaigns is Strangling Progressive Politics in America. Stanford University Press. Fisher published this opinion after completing a 2003 study of random canvass offices throughout the entire United States. On May 15, 2009, the Fund for the Public Interest (the funder for Environment California), settled for US$2.15 million in a lawsuit over unpaid overtime, below-minimum wages, and unpaid training for canvassers and canvassing management and staff. The suit affected canvassers and other canvassing staff working for Environment California.

It is part of the Verona Area School District. Academics Accredited by the North Central Association, VAHS offers a core curriculum in grades 9 through 12 that does not track students by ability; instead advanced opportunities are offered within the curriculum of each course. Consequently, VAHS courses do not carry designations such as \\"Honors\\" in their titles. Grade 9 and 10 students in core classes are taught in teams of English/social studies and math/science instructors. Students in the 11th and 12th grades have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement courses in English language, English literature, world history, chemistry, biology, physics B, physics C, statistics, psychology, calculus AB, and calculus BC. Athletics VAHS has 22 athletics programs and a staff of 65 coaches. Each program consists of a varsity team, a junior varsity team, and, for some sports, one or more freshman teams. In the 2008-09 school year, VAHS became a member of the Big Eight Conference, moving from the Badger South Conference. The school athletic teams were originally nicknamed the Verona Indians, but this was changed in 1991 to the Verona Wildcats. =State championships= * Basketball (girls): 2016http://host.madison.com/wsj/sports/high-school/basketball/girls/wiaa- state-girls-basketball-verona-outlasts-mukwonago-for-first- state/article_9ae31a41-fae0-5b6b-bb6b-5b04f7f5f81f.html * Cross Country (boys): 1974, 1982, 1991https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Cross_Country/State_Records/bteamchamps.pdf * Cross Country (girls): 1980, 1981, 1984 https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Cross_Country/State_Records/gteamchamps.pdf * Golf (girls): 2014https://www.wiaawi.org/News/NewsReleases/tabid/113/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/5091/Edgewood- Verona-Win-Girls-Golf-Team-Titles.aspx * Hockey (boys): 2014, 2020https://www.wiaawi.org/News/NewsReleases/tabid/113/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3969/Verona- Wins-2014-Boys-State-Hockey-Championship.aspx * Soccer (boys): 2019 * Soccer (girls): 2010 http://www.wkow.com/story/12677668/verona-wins-their-first-wiaa- girls-soccer-championship * Swimming (boys): 1993, 2000https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Swim_Boys/State_Records/teamchamps.pdf * Swimming (girls): 1998https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Swim_Girls/State_Records/teamchamps.pdf * Track & Field (boys): 1992, 1999, 2010(wheelchair)http://www.veronatrackandfield.com/2014/01/26/the-tradition * Track & Field (girls): 1984, 1985, 1991https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Track/State_Records/gteamchamps.pdf =State Tournament Appearances= * Baseball: 2011https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Baseball_Spring/State_Records/stateparticipation.pdf * Basketball (boys): 2006, 2007, 2011https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Basketball_Boys/teamparticipation.pdf * Basketball (girls): 2008, 2009, 2010, 2016https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Basketball_Girls/teamparticipation.pdf * Cross Country (boys): 1973, 1974, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007 https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Cross_Country/State_Records/bteamparticipation.pdf * Cross Country (girls): 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2008, 2010, 2011 https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Cross_Country/State_Records/gteamparticipation.pdf * Football: 2008https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Football/State_Records/participation.pdf * Gymnastics: 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2020https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Gymnastics/State_Records/teamparticipation.pdf * Golf (boys): 2018https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Golf_Boys/teamappearances.pdf * Golf (girls): 2004, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Golf_Girls/State_Records/teamappearances.pdf * Hockey (boys): 2002, 2003, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020 * Soccer (boys): 2019 https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Boys_Soccer/State_Records/stateparticipation.pdf * Soccer (girls): 1994, 1995, 2010https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Soccer_Girls/State_Records/stateparticipation.pdf * Softball: 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016 https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Softball/State_Records/stateparticipation.pdf * Tennis (boys): 2002, 2003, 2004, 2016, 2018https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Tennis_Boys/State_Records/teamparticipation.pdf * Tennis (girls): 2000, 2002https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Tennis_Girls/teamparticipation.pdf * Volleyball (girls): 2011, 2015https://www.wiaawi.org/Portals/0/PDF/Results/Volleyball_Girls/State_Records/teamparticipation.pdf Notable alumni *Casey FitzRandolph, gold medalist speed skater at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games *Nick Schmaltz, member of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL (2016-present) *Jack Skille, member of the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL (2016-present); former member of the Chicago Blackhawks (2007-2011), Florida Panthers (2011-2013), Columbus Blue Jackets (2013-2015), and Colorado Avalanche (2015-2016) *Derek Stanley, former NFL wide receiver with the St. Louis Rams (2007-2009) *Eric Studesville, assistant coach with the Denver Broncos (2010-present); he was the interim head coach for the last four games of the 2010 season *Neil Walker, gold & silver medalist swimmer at the 2000 Summer Olympics; gold & bronze medalist swimmer at the 2004 Summer OlympicsNeil Walker at Sports Reference *Joe Wineke, Wisconsin politician References External links * Category:Public high schools in Wisconsin Category:Schools in Dane County, Wisconsin ","title":"Verona Area High School"},{"id":"11184847","text":"Marmot is an unincorporated community in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States located in the Mount Hood Corridor. It is within the boundaries of the Villages at Mount Hood, on a ridge known at Devil's Backbone, which lies between the Sandy and Little Sandy rivers, along the historic Barlow Road (the final stretch of the Oregon Trail.) The community was named by Adolph (or Adolf) Aschoff, a German immigrant who was for many years a forester and guide in the Mount Hood area. When he settled in the area near the Sandy River in 1883, he found many animal burrows that, according to the local residents, were made by marmots. He later discovered that they were actually made by the mountain beaver, another rodent. When the post office was established in about 1886, Aschoff and two of his friends decided to name it \\"Marmot\\" on account of this error. Construction of the Mount Hood Highway in the 1920s diverted traffic away from Marmot, and fewer visitors came to stay at Aschoff's hotel. Aschoff sold the hotel in 1930, and died soon after. Marmot post office was discontinued in 1930. Most of the buildings burned to the ground in 1931, with the exception of Aschoff's museum, the post office, and a store. None of these structures remain today.

Most commonly, in silver-gelatin photography, it consists of silver halide crystals dispersed in gelatin. The emulsion is usually coated onto a substrate of glass, films (of cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate or polyester), paper, or fabric. Photographic emulsion is not a true emulsion, but a suspension of solid particles (silver halide) in a fluid (gelatin in solution). However, the word emulsion is customarily used in a photographic context. Gelatin or gum arabic layers sensitized with dichromate used in the dichromated colloid processes carbon and gum bichromate are sometimes called emulsions. Some processes do not have emulsions, such as platinum, cyanotype, salted paper, or kallitype. Components Photographic emulsion is a fine suspension of insoluble light-sensitive crystals in a colloid sol, usually consisting of gelatin. The light-sensitive component is one or a mixture of silver halides: silver bromide, chloride and iodide. The gelatin is used as a permeable binder, allowing processing agents (e.g., developer, fixer, toners, etc.) in aqueous solution to enter the colloid without dislodging the crystals. Other polymer macromolecules are often blended, but gelatin has not been entirely replaced. The light-exposed crystals are reduced by the developer to black metallic silver particles that form the image. Colour films and papers have multiple layers of emulsion, made sensitive to different parts of the visible spectrum by different colour sensitizers, and incorporating different dye couplers which produce superimposed yellow, magenta and cyan dye images during development. Panchromatic black-and-white film also includes colour sensitizers, but as part of a single emulsion layer. Manufacture A solution of silver nitrate is mixed into a warm gelatin solution containing potassium bromide, sodium chloride or other alkali metal halides. A reaction precipitates fine crystals of insoluble silver halides that are light- sensitive. The silver halide is actually being 'peptized' by the gelatin. The type and quantity of gelatin used influences the final emulsion's properties. A pH buffer, crystal habit modifier, metal dopants, ripener, ripening restrainer, surfactants, defoamer, emulsion stabilizer and biocide are also used in emulsion making. Most modern emulsions are \\"washed\\" to remove some of the reaction byproducts (potassium nitrate and excess salts). The \\"washing\\" or desalting step can be performed by ultrafiltration, dialysis, coagulation (using acylated gelatin), or a classic noodle washing method. Emulsion making also incorporates steps to increase sensitivity by using chemical sensitizing agents and sensitizing dyes.

Pieces by Pierce were predominantly created for use in big bands. Biography Pierce was born in Somerville, Massachusetts. United States. Following schooling at the New England Conservatory and working as an amateur musician in the Boston area, Pierce then led his own band which featured Charlie Mariano from 1949 to 1951. After working with Woody Herman from 1951 to 1966 as chief arranger and assistant road manager, Pierce took residence in New York City and freelanced with musicians such as Pee Wee Russell, Lester Young, Emmett Berry and Ruby Braff. From 1957 to 1959, Pierce led a band off and on which featured Buck Clayton, Gus Johnson and Paul Quinichette. He recorded with a number of other well-known musicians as well, including Quincy Jones, Coleman Hawkins and Pee Wee Russell. Pierce was noted for his ability to play piano in the Basie style and appeared on many releases by Basie sidemen. Pierce also arranged the music for The Sound of Jazz, a 1954 CBS television special hosted by John Crosby. Together with Frank Capp he founded the Capp/Pierce Juggernaut Band in 1975, which performed in to the 1990s. Pierce died of complications from an abdominal infection in Los Angeles, California.

Those were \\"Step Into The Light\\" and \\"You're the Dream.\\" \\"Step Into The Light\\" was featured on the Japanese commercial for Lux Super Rich which featured the Spanish actress, Pen√©lope Cruz. \\"Step Into the Light\\" was remixed by Love to Infinity and included on a house music compilation released by Avex Trax. \\"You're the Dream\\" was chosen as the anthem track for the 2002 Special Olympics which was hosted by Walt Disney Records. Though there was no official single release, the track, \\"Hanging Up On You\\" was featured on Radio Disney's 'Mighty Music CD' included in McDonald's Mighty Kids Meal packages. The track, \\"Like A Girl In Love\\" was also met with promotional release as the third track on Pillsburry/Hollywood Records EP release, \\"Strudelpalooza: 2002 Event\\" to promote an event.  Album credits  According to the album credits included on the US release of Myra, it was mixed and recorded at Angel Recording Studios, World Tree Studios, Bananaboat Studios, Next Faze Studios, Signet Soundelux, Beachhouse Studios, Image Recorders, orange studios, Westlake Audio, Studio D Studios, Larrabee West, and Igloo Studios. It was mastered by Eddy Screyer at Oasis Mastering. Track listing Reception Despite commercially successful sales, live performances, and a few TV appearances at the time, Myra failed to be a charting success, only seeking at #47 on the Top Heatseekers chart, this was mostly due to the album being met with very little promotion from Buena Vista/Walt Disney Records. However, the album was met with positive reviews from music critics, many praising the album for being fun, energetic and playful. Both Allmusic and Yahoo! gave the album a three[] out of five stars rating. As of 2017, the album has been considered a cult classic mostly due to the popularity of Miracles Happen (When you Believe) and Dancing in the Street. Singles \\"Dancing in the Street\\" was the first single, which was also part of Recess: School's Out film soundtrack. The music video was located in a black and white background in Los Angeles, California with Myra and the dancers dancing with a disc jockey playing music with records and is directed by Scott Marshall and choreographed by Darrin Henson. Another version was made where the video is interplaced with clips of the \\"Green Tambourine\\" closing sequence of the movie and Myra performing against a bluescreen displaying clips of the film. This version was featured at the end of the VHS of the film. \\"Miracles Happen (When You Believe)\\" was the second single and was also part of The Princess Diaries film soundtrack. The music video was located at The Shoppes at Buckland Hills mall in Connecticut and Myra and the girls go to Limited Too for a fashion and shopping spree and meet up with the boys. It was directed by Scott Marshall and choreographed by Darrin Henson.

It is a similar but stronger effect than the Voigt effect (in which the medium is a gas instead of a liquid). The electric analog is the Kerr effect. It was discovered in 1907 by Aim√© Cotton and Henri Mouton, working in collaboration. When a linearly polarized wave propagates perpendicular to magnetic field (e.g. in a magnetized plasma), it can become elliptized. Because a linearly polarized wave is some combination of in-phase X & O modes, and because X & O waves propagate with different phase velocities, this causes elliptization of the emerging beam. As the waves propagate, the phase difference (Œ¥) between EX & EO increases.

Sceptre is best known for its affordable LED, LCD, and 4K displays. Its other products include audio, car cams, and car batteries. Sceptre Inc. has also produced CRT televisions, notebook PCs, touch screens, CRT computer monitors, WiFi networking products, USB flash drives and cameras. History From its earliest beginnings in 1984 until the mid-90s, Sceptre exclusively specialized in manufacturing and selling computer monitors. One of Sceptre‚Äôs most important partnerships during this period was with Hartco, a leading distributor in the Canadian electronics market. As a play on words that represents its focus on computer monitors (monitor lizard), Sceptre adopted the Komodo dragon as its mascot, and named it Brutus. The company regularly donated a substantial amount of its proceeds to the Zoological Society of San Diego. With a background in developing LCD displays since 1993, Sceptre then made the decision to transition to manufacturing and wholesaling LCD TVs. Although the TVs are often equipped with a QAM tuner, the LCD monitors can function as both a TV and monitor  Products  Sceptre laid its roots early in mass-produced monitors with the monochrome display and then easily transitioned to producing color displays. In line with designing computer monitors, Sceptre also ventured into producing electronic notebooks, with successful results. PC Magazine concluded that The Sceptre Soundx Series 3000 Pentium 90 and 75 performed ‚Äúat or near the top‚Äù of their competitive market after testing 80 different notebooks. In 2013, Sceptre added Mobile High- Definition Link (MHL) to many of its LCD TVs. This technology allows users to connect smartphones and tablets to the TV via a cable that has an HDMI connector on end and an MHL connector on the other. Sceptre designed its first 4K UHD TV in late 2014 with a 49-inch model, the U500CV-UMK. Currently, its 4K models come equipped with HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2 and MEMC 120. At 60 frames per second, HDMI 2.0 transports 4K content at double the speed of 1.4. Motion Estimation/Motion Compensation (MEMC) smooths out blurring as objects are in motion on the screen, at approximately 120 frames per second. This feature is highly effective during action sequences, such as the kind found in sports, but has less relevance during fictional programming, such as sitcoms, when people and objects are frequently stationary or not moving at high speeds. As of 2016, Sceptre has designed 9 different 4K models, ranging between 43 and 65 inches.  Community outreach  Since its founding, Sceptre has played an active role in the Los Angeles community. It has participated in numerous Cherry Festivals, Arcadia Lunar New Year Festival, and Walnut‚Äôs 2015 Relay for Life.

At 446 feet, it is the fourth tallest building in Wisconsin and the tallest residential building. It is located in Milwaukee's East Town neighborhood adjacent to the Lake Michigan shoreline. The tower as originally planned was designed by Santiago Calatrava was to have only 25 stories. That plan was cancelled because of concerns about parking and its potential to obstruct views of the lake. However, the project was revived in June 2002 and ground was broken two years later. The tower is built on land owned by the University Club of Milwaukee. It is adjacent connected to the Club, and the tower's health center serves as the health center for club members.

It is known for its association with ghost stories and has been the subject of paranormal investigations. History On May 3, 1825, the federal government decided that a light was needed at Point Lookout to warn ships of the shoals and to mark the entrance to the Potomac River, and appropriated $1,800 for the project. The owner, Jenifer Taylor, refused the offer of $500 for the land, though he apparently offered to accept this price if he were named keeper. The purchase was delayed and eventually a county commission set a value of $1,150. Because of the cost overruns for the land purchase, Congress appropriated $4,500 on May 23, 1828, and awarded a contract on July 22, 1830, to John Donahoo for $3,050. Construction commenced before the deed to the land was obtained and Jenifer Taylor argued with the government until the matter was resolved some 2 years after the lighthouse became operational. Donahoo built a story-and-a-half house which was first lit on September 20, 1830 by keeper James Davis. Davis died a few months after taking the oath of office and his daughter, Ann Davis, kept the light until 1847. In 1854, the light was upgraded with a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The Civil War completely transformed the point. First, the Hammond General Hospital was built in 1862 to care for Union wounded. In 1863, Confederate prisoners began to be held at the hospital; and soon Camp Hoffman, a vast prison camp, was built, eventually holding 20,000 prisoners, of whom more than 3,000 died due to the harsh conditions, limited food rations and poor shelter from the elements. A fog bell tower was added in 1873. In 1883, the lighthouse was raised to two full stories with a summer kitchen and additional bedroom added at the southwest corner. Also in 1883, a buoy repair depot was built on the south side of the light; in 1884, a coal storage shed was built to the south of the buoy repair depot. The new structures obscured the fog bell, which was then replaced with a new fog bell on the east end of the coal storage shed. In 1927, the lighthouse was converted to a duplex, more than doubling the size of the building. The duplex allowed for a keeper and assistant keeper to live on-site and still have some privacy. The light was served by civilian and Coast Guard keepers. In 1939, the United States Coast Guard took over control of all U.S. lighthouses, and the keepers were pressured, but not required, to join the Coast Guard. In 1951, the United States Navy began buying property around the light. On January 11, 1966, the light was deactivated and the structures were turned over to the Navy. Civilians continued to live in the house until 1981, when a dispute over a failing well led to the revocation of a 99-year lease that the state had with the Navy. The fog bell tower was moved to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in 1968. Throughout the 1960s, the State of Maryland purchased land north of the lighthouse and carved out the Point Lookout State Park. In 2006, the light was turned over to Maryland as part of a land-swap deal. Also in 2006, the Point Lookout Lighthouse Preservation Society was founded to restore the lighthouse complex to the 1927 era. The lighthouse is owned by Maryland and is accessible one day a month from April to November by volunteers of the Point Lookout Lighthouse Preservation Society. The group also holds night time \\"paranormal investigations\\" to raise funds for preservation and restoration activities. The haunted reputation is a dual-edged sword, and has caused severe damage to historically significant parts of the lighthouse due to vandals breaking into the lighthouse. While unusual things have happened at the lighthouse, it is unclear who, how or why the lighthouse is referred to as the most haunted lighthouse in America. Several television shows have dedicated segments to the lighthouse, including Mystery Hunters, Weird Travels and Haunted Lighthouses.

He was the father of jazz guitarist John Pizzarelli and double bassist Martin Pizzarelli. He worked for NBC as a staffman for Dick Cavett (1971) and ABC with Bobby Rosengarden in (1952). The list of musicians he collaborated with includes Benny Goodman, Les Paul, St√©phane Grappelli, and Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. Pizzarelli cited as influences Django Reinhardt, Freddie Green, and George Van Eps. Early life Pizzarelli was born on January 9, 1926, in Paterson, New Jersey. He learned to play guitar and banjo at a young age. His uncles, Pete and Bobby Domenick, were professional musicians, and sometimes the extended family would gather at one of their homes with their guitars for jam sessions. Pizzarelli cited as an inspiration Joe Mooney, a blind accordion player who led a quartet that included Pizzarelli's uncle, Bobby Domenick. During high school, Pizzarelli was the guitarist for a small band that performed classical music. Career Pizzarelli began his professional career at 17 when he joined the Vaughn Monroe dance band in 1944. In 1952 Pizzarelli became a staff musician for NBC, playing with Skitch Henderson. In 1964, he became a member of The Tonight Show Band on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During his time spent performing for the Tonight Show, he accompanied guest bands and musicians playing through a variety of musical genres, including playing with Tiny Tim (after tuning the performer's ukulele) on the day that Tiny Tim married Miss Vicki on Carson's show. From 1956 to 1957, Pizzarelli used the stage name \\"Johnny Buck\\" and performed with The Three Suns pop music trio. He toured several times with Benny Goodman until Goodman's death in 1986. During the following year, he and guitarist George Barnes formed a duo and recorded two albums, including a live performance in August 1971, at The Town Hall in New York City. Beginning in the 1970s, he began recording as a leader, issuing many tributes to musicians of the 1930s. He performed with Benny Goodman at the White House in Washington, D.C., and he performed for presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and First Lady Pat Nixon. \\"Jersey Jazz Guitars\\" was the name of a 1985 concert held at the Rutgers University Nicholas Music Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The ticket featured Pizzarelli, Les Paul, Tal Farlow, and Pizzarelli's son, John. The concert was aired on New Jersey's public radio station as part of their three-part New Jersey Summerfare Series. Pizzarelli and Les Paul had performed together before, as they were neighbors and friends. The show aired for one hour in August 1985, with son John adding his vocals on two selections. Pizzarelli continued to play into his 90s, making several appearances even after a stroke in 2016, officially retiring after a final brief appearance with Michael Feinstein in 2018. He died of COVID-19 on April 1, 2020, in Saddle River, New Jersey. He had been battling several serious health problems in recent years. =Guitars= Pizzarelli's first guitar was an archtop Gibson, an expensive instrument at the time. He played a Benedetto Bucky Pizzarelli Signature seven-string guitar made by Robert Benedetto, who also makes guitars for Howard Alden and Frank Vignola. He learned to play the seven-string from George Van Eps. The extra string on Pizzarelli's guitar provided him with a bass line during performances. Pizzarelli also played a custom seven-string American archtop guitar made by luthier Dale Unger, who also makes custom guitars for Pizzarelli's partner, Ed Laub.

About 10 years later when Sony introduced the Beta format, the first couple of models the video head speed was controlled by a line synchronised AC motor and eddy-current brake. The model shown here, X500VT, was sold only in Japan and the United States, ~(under the Rheem/Roberts re-badge agreement) and in very low quantities due to its high cost. the highest serial number known to author is 00050, indicating the probability of only a tiny production run.

This cisticola is a resident breeder in southernmost Angola, Namibia and western South Africa. The grey-backed cisticola is a very common bird of coastal fynbos, karoo shrub and grassy areas on estuarine flats. Description The grey-backed cisticola is a small, 13‚Äì14 cm long, vocal, dull-coloured bird with a dark rufous crown to its reddish head. It has a rufous panel in the folded wing. The grey bill is short and straight, and the feet and legs are pinkish-brown. The eye is light brown. The southern form, \\"grey-backed cisticola\\" proper, found in southern Namibia and South Africa has a grey back heavily streaked with black. Its underparts are greyish white. Although cisticolas can be very similar in plumage, this greyish subspecies is quite distinctive. The northern subspecies has a brown back heavily streaked with black and cold buff underparts. It is very similar to the wailing cisticola, Cisticola lais, of eastern South Africa, but that species has warmer buff underparts and does not overlap in range. The sexes are similar, but juvenile birds are duller with a yellow face. The call of the grey-backed cisticola is a soft prrrrt followed by a sharp wheee phweee. Behaviour The grey-backed cisticola builds a ball- shaped nest with a side entrance from dry grass, cobwebs and felted plant down. It is usually seen in pairs or singly, flitting in a bush or the grass at the base of a tree as it forages for small insects. Conservation status This common species has a large range, with an estimated extent of 820,000 km¬≤. The population size is believed to be large, and the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as least concern.

He was a son of Selig Trebitsch, ·∏•azzan at the Old New Synagogue, and he received a thorough Talmudical training at the yeshiva of Jacob G√ºnsberg. Upon the recommendation of the \\"Landesrabbiner\\" Mordecai Benet (Marcus Benedict), Trebitsch became rabbi of Prostƒõjov in 1826. On May 13, 1832, the government confirmed the election of Trebitsch as \\"Landesrabbiner\\" of Moravia, in succession to Mordecai Benet, and granted him a salary of 600 florins; he was the last Moravian \\"Landesrabbiner\\" of the old school. In September 1833, the provincial government issued a decree conferring upon the chief rabbi the power of proposing candidates for the various rabbinates of the province, and of making an appointment when the congregation failed to inform him of a vacancy or rejected the candidate proposed by the \\"Landesrabbiner\\". This decree, for which Trebitsch was declared by his opponents to be responsible, brought him into conflict with the congregations of Jev√≠ƒçko, Hranice na Moravƒõ, Prostƒõjov, and Lo≈°tice; and five years later (May 23, 1838) another decree canceled the chief rabbi's privilege of proposing candidates. Abraham Neuda, rabbi of Lo≈°tice, whom Trebitsch refused to confirm on account of liberal tendencies, was reinstated after having passed a successful examination before a committee of which Trebitsch was a member. This defeat, and the censure of the government for his opposition to the use of the German language among the Jews greatly affected Trebitsch, who died while on a journey to Karlovy Vary.

Artist's conception of the inside of the Glaser Safety Slug. Polymer-tipped bullets are a type of hollow-point bullet tipped with a polymer nose cone. Most tips are made of polyoxymethylene, although some manufacturers have used polyester urethane-methylenebis(phenylisocyanate) copolymer. Description The bullets consist of a fairly normal hollow-point bullet with the frontal cavity filled in by hard plastic, which is molded into a streamlined shape. Upon impact, the plastic drives into the hollow point and the bullet performs like a standard hollow-point, expanding (\\"mushrooming\\") to a larger diameter. These bullets possess the aerodynamics for longer, more accurate flights, and the in-target performance to ensure high lethality. Usage Traditionally, these bullets are intended for use in rifles and single-shot handguns, as pistols are not normally used at the great distances where the streamlined ballistic tip is advantageous. However, a few companies produce pistol ammunition with plastic- tipped hollow points where the plastic is molded into a more rounded tip. These designs are not created to increase the streamlining of the bullet but rather to improve ammunition feeding in semi-automatic pistols that are prone to jams with standard hollow point ammunition. Examples of such pistol ammunition include Cor-Bon/Glaser's \\"Glaser Pow'RBall\\" line and Extreme Shock's \\"NyTrilium Air Freedom\\" ammunition (the \\"NyTrilium Air Freedom\\" cartridge also mimics the performance of Glaser Safety Slug cartridges, as it uses hollow bullets full of powdered metal designed to fragment rapidly on hitting a target).

With a musical career that spanned more than seven decades through some of the most turbulent periods of Vietnamese history and with more than one thousand songs to his credit, he is widely considered one of the three most salient and influential figures of modern Vietnamese music, along with VƒÉn Cao and Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n.Shepherd Continuum encyclopedia of popular music of the world p226 3x entries on Ph·∫°m-Duy His music is noted for combining elements of traditional music with new methods, creating melodies that are both modern and traditional. A politically polarizing figure, his entire body of work was banned in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War and subsequently in unified Vietnam for more than 30 years until the government began to ease restrictions on some of his work upon his repatriation in 2005. Life Ph·∫°m Duy was born Ph·∫°m Duy C·∫©n, on October 5, 1921, in Hanoi. His father Ph·∫°m Duy T·ªën was a progressive journalist and writer, and one of the earliest writers of European-style short stories. Ph·∫°m Duy T·ªën was also one of the founders of the Tonkin Free School movement. Ph·∫°m Duy's father died when he was two, and he was raised largely by his older brother Ph·∫°m Duy Khi√™m, whom he described as a strict and tyrannical figure. Ph·∫°m Duy Khi√™m later became a professor and South Vietnam's ambassador to France, as well as a Francophone writer. He attended Thang Long High School where his teachers included V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p. He then attended the College of Arts and the Ky Nghe Thuc Hanh Vocational College. He taught himself music and studied in France in 1954-55 under Robert Lopez and as an unregistered student at the Institut de Musicologie in Paris. He started his musical career as a singer in the Duc Huy musical troupe, performing around the country in 1943-44. He then joined a musical cadre for the Viet Minh during their resistance against the French. He and the musician VƒÉn Cao became great friends while there and they collaborated on some of their earliest songs together. He left the Viet Minh after 6 years for French- controlled Hanoi and subsequently moved south to Saigon after becoming disenchanted with their censorship. His work was subsequently banned in communist-controlled areas.Nguyen C√¥ng C√¥ng Luan Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars: Memoirs of a Victim Turned Soldier 2012 \\"The banned songs were by different composers, including the famous Ph·∫°m Duy, who left the Vi·ªát Minh ...\\"Nghia M.

Norton Music and Protest in 1968 2013 =Exile and return to Vietnam= Ph·∫°m Duy performing in Saigon After the fall of Saigon, Ph·∫°m Duy and his family moved to the United States where he settled in Midway City, California. His music was banned in Vietnam between 1975 and 2005. However, his music continued to be performed and widely known both inside and outside Vietnam. He pursued a minstrel's life and appeared regularly all over the world to sing his new refugees' songs (t·ªã n·∫°n ca) and prisoners' songs (ng·ª•c ca), and songs derived from the poems of his friend Ho√†ng C·∫ßm (which he termed Ho√†ng C·∫ßm ca). Ph·∫°m Duy first returned to Vietnam for visits in 2000. In 2005, he announced that he and his son, the singer Duy Quang, would return permanently. His announced return was greeted with much fanfare in Vietnam, and the government began to ease restrictions on his work. To date, dozens of his songs have been allowed to circulate in Vietnam again. =Death= Ph·∫°m Duy died on January 27, 2013, in Saigon, one month after the death of his eldest son Duy Quang. His wife Thai Hang had died in 1999 to lung cancer. At 91 years of age he had been suffering heart and liver disease and gout. A documentary film Pham Duy, music and life is yet to be released. Mirroring widespread reaction from the public and his fellow artists, singer Anh Tuyet said, \\"Hearing that he died, I'm melting ...\\" Acclaimed film director ƒê·∫∑ng Nh·∫≠t Minh, who was contracted to direct a movie about Ph·∫°m Duy's life, expressed his regret of not being able to do it during his lifetime. An impromptu benefit concert was held in his honor on February 1, with the 60 million VND proceeds going to his family. Thousands of well-wishers, including many of the most notable names in Vietnamese music, paid their respects at his home before he was buried on February 3, 2013, in Binh Duong Park Cemetery. At his funeral, attendees spontaneously sang some of his most famous songs. Family Ph·∫°m Duy's father was Ph·∫°m Duy T·ªën, a noted journalist and writer, and his mother was Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã H√≤a. He was the youngest of five children, and his eldest brother was Ph·∫°m Duy Khi√™m, who became a Francophone writer. He was considered the \\"patriarch\\" of a musical dynasty. His wife, the singer Th√°i H·∫±ng, was the older sister of the composer Ph·∫°m ƒê√¨nh Ch∆∞∆°ng as well as of the singer Th√°i Thanh, who gained widespread fame performing many of Ph·∫°m Duy's works. His eight children have achieved success in music as part of the band The Dreamers who performed around the world. His eldest son was the singer Duy Quang (who predeceased him by more than a month), and another son is musician Duy C∆∞·ªùng. His daughters include the singers Th√°i Hi·ªÅn and Th√°i Th·∫£o. Th√°i Th·∫£o's husband is the noted singer Tu·∫•n Ng·ªçc. Among his nieces and nephews are the singers √ù Lan (daughter of Th√°i Thanh) and Mai H∆∞∆°ng. Legacy Professor Vu Duc Vuong, a director at Hoa Sen University, said that Pham Duy was Vietnam's most important musician of the 20th century, and compared him favorably to Nguy·ªÖn Du, H·ªì Xu√¢n H∆∞∆°ng, and Xu√¢n Di·ªáu. He is considered one of the most prolific and varied musicians of modern Vietnamese music, as well as one of those who molded it from its infancy. Generations of Vietnamese grew up memorizing many of his songs and many singers gained fame performing his works, most notably his sister-in-law Th√°i Thanh. Ethnomusicologist Jason Gibbs described Ph·∫°m Duy as \\"a writer of undeniable sensitivity and created works that Vietnamese will remember for hundreds of years. There is a remarkable directness, honesty and depth of feeling in his lyrics, during a time when many Vietnamese creative figures had to be guarded in their expression.\\" In the last years of his life, he campaigned unsuccessfully to have the entire oeuvre of his works, excepting those that \\"the government would deem inappropriate\\", to freely circulate in Vietnam again. Among his strongest advocates are renowned musicologist Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Kh√™, historian D∆∞∆°ng Trung Qu·ªëc, and researcher Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫Øc Xu√¢n, who wanted the government to allow, at minimum, his song cycles Con ƒë∆∞·ªùng c√°i quan (The Mandarin Road) and M·∫π Vi·ªát Nam (Mother Vietnam), particularly its concluding song \\"Vi·ªát Nam Vi·ªát Nam\\". The two song cycles, according to Kh√™, are \\"masterpieces deserving to be disseminated across the whole country because of their true artistic qualities\\". With these two cycles, Pham Duy \\"talked about a totally unified Vietnam, painted a picture of Vietnam complete geographically and culturally, from the breadth of its history to the depth of its soul, from its philosophy to its outlook on life.\\" After his music was banned in Vietnam for more than 30 years, he and his music were considered to have been forgotten by the newer generations. However, according to the musician Tu·∫•n Khanh, the outpouring of reaction on social media before and after his death clearly showed that his name is not so easily forgotten. Criticism Ph·∫°m Duy's 2005 move from the U.S., where he resided since 1975, to Saigon, was a cause for much criticism, from both outside and within Vietnam. Some overseas Vietnamese accused him of hypocrisy and of showing sympathy towards the communist government of Vietnam, even though a number of his songs have been about resistance, refugees, and their Vietnam. In contrast, some musicians from within Vietnam, particularly Hanoi, saw the acclaim he received on his return as inappropriate for someone whom they consider a traitor. In 2006, his first post-1975 concert in Vietnam was well received by critics. However, composer Nguy·ªÖn L∆∞u wrote an article titled \\"[You] can't acclaim\\" in which he criticized Ph·∫°m Duy's works, citing many instances in which he saw bourgeois or anti-communist lyrics. The article received much criticism from readers, with some calling the criticism \\"simplistic\\" or \\"ignorant\\". In 2009, Musician Ph·∫°m Tuy√™n, author of many well- known socialist songs (and son of the journalist Ph·∫°m Qu·ª≥nh), stated that to judge him, one must look at his contributions as well as his mistakes. To him, the media mentioning Pham Duy's great music while ignoring all his past mistakes is unfair to musicians who have spent their whole lives devoted to the Revolution. Tr·ªçng B·∫±ng, another musician of so-called \\"red music\\", said that Ph·∫°m Duy had a \\"sinful past\\", while the musician H·ªìng ƒêƒÉng said that \\"the true value of an artist is his patriotism...and truthfully only some of [Ph·∫°m Duy]'s song received popular success, not all were well-received.\\" After Ph·∫°m Duy's death, Ph·∫°m Tuy√™n said that \\"my generation is still influenced by Ph·∫°m Duy's music...his songs about homeland, country, left a lasting impression on my mind,\\" and that \\"I was very happy when he returned.\\" However, no representative from the Vietnam Musicians Association attended his funeral, and according to musician Tu·∫•n Khanh, the Propaganda Committee warned the media not to make a big deal out of his death. Works =Periods= Pham Duy divided his career into several periods: * Folk Songs (D√¢n Ca), which recorded the images of the Vietnamese during the struggle for independence, culminating in his Song Cycles (Truong Ca), which join several folk tunes to proclaim the greatness of the Vietnamese people. Included in this period is his 1968 album, Folk Songs of Vietnam, released on Folkways Records.Ph·∫°m-Duy D√¢n Ca: Folk Songs * Heart' Songs (T√¢m Ca) - which aimed to awake humanity's conscience, to protest against violence and inhumanity. * Spiritual Songs (ƒê·∫°o Ca), with a Zen character, which aimed to seek for the truth. * Profane Songs (T·ª•c Ca), which tackled head-on hypocritical attitudes and phony virtues. * Children's Song (Nh·∫°c thi·∫øu nhi), Young Women's Songs (N·ªØ Ca) and Peace Songs (B√¨nh Ca), which were songs of joy. * Resistance Songs and for the motherland * Refugees Songs and for life in exile. In addition, his many love songs have been sung and learned by heart by three generations over the last forty years.Lucy Nguyen-Hong-Nhiem - A Dragon Child: Reflections Of A Daughter Of Annam In America - Page 7 2004 \\"(Rain on the Leaves) by Ph·∫°m Duy, a popular song on the radio: ‚ÄúThe rain on the leaves Is the tear of joy Of the girl whose boy Returns from the war; The rain on the leaves Is the bitter tears When a mother hears Her son is no more... ...

It was co-founded in 2006 by Jon Soltz and Jeremy Broussard. Initially composed of United States Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, the organization views defense policy as an American priority. In 2020, the stated goal of the PAC is to elect veterans to public office that \\"fully support our men and women in uniform.\\" According to the group's website, in 2020, the group is backed by over 700,000 supporters, including veterans, military families and civilians. VoteVets.org describes itself as a progressive organization, but has endorsed Democrats and Republicans for office. In media, they have been described as \\"closely aligned with Congressional Democrats,\\" and \\"liberal\\" by The New York Times and The Washington Post. By election =2006= During the United States 2006 election cycle, VoteVets.org PAC spent between $1.2 and $2 million (sources differ) trying to influence the outcomes of various congressional races. Senators targeted by the VoteVets' campaign for their support of the Iraq War included Republicans George Allen, Rick Santorum, Conrad Burns, and Jim Talent. For each congressional campaign, they released a television advertisement criticizing the (now former) senators for their vote against body armor for US troops in 2003.YouTube Vote Vets PAC television advertisement against George Allen. VoteVets claim was based, in part, on the Republican senators' vote against an amendment offered Accessed via Lexis Nexis. by Democratic Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, in 2003, to boost National Guard and Reserves equipment funding by $1 billion. Accessed via Lexis Nexis. The group FactCheck.org (a self-described non-partisan project of the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania) stated that the ad was misleading because the 2003 Senate budget amendment (on which the criticism was based) made no specific reference to \\"body armor\\". Accessed via Lexis Nexis. However, the progressive Media Matters for America repeatedly pointed out what it said were \\"misleading\\" statements about the ads by FactCheck.org. The group also ran ads targeting now-former Republican Representatives Melissa Hart, Gil Gutknecht, John Sweeney, John Doolittle, and Jon Porter. In that ad, an Iraq veteran, Tomas Young, who was paralyzed in Iraq, criticized the members of Congress for voting against increases in funding for veterans‚Äô health care, while, in some cases, voting themselves a pay raise. The group also made a number of contributions to candidates, but only to those candidates who served during the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. In 2006, out of all the Iraq or Afghanistan veterans running for Congress, VoteVets.org supported all but one of them (Van Taylor, Republican in Texas). Those endorsed candidates were: Patrick Murphy (D-PA), Joe Sestak (D-PA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sam Schultz (R-IN), Andrew Duck (D-MD), and David Harris (D-TX). The group also supported Tim Walz (D-MN), and Chris Carney (D-PA). Murphy, Sestak, Walz, and Carney were all elected to Congress, and VoteVets.org‚Äôs site indicated they were endorsed for their 2008 reelection. =2008= VoteVets.org Political Action Committee continued to endorse Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for Congress in the 2008 elections. Those included Rick Noriega (D-TX) who ran for Senate in Texas against incumbent John Cornyn, and many who ran for the House, including John Boccieri (D-OH), Michael D. Lumpkin (D-CA), Ashwin Madia (D-MN), Jill Morgenthaler (D-IL), Steve Sarvi (D-MN), and Jonathan Powers (D-NY). The group endorsed candidates who are not Iraq or Afghanistan combat veterans, including Eric Massa (D-NY), and Gary Peters (D-MI), who had both served within the past decade. The group also held an on-line runoff, in which members were able to vote for one older veteran to endorse. That runoff was won by Charlie Brown (D-CA), who the group endorsed. The group also endorsed the candidates who it endorsed in 2006 and reached Congress, Democratic Representatives Patrick Murphy, Joe Sestak, Tim Walz, and Chris Carney. Overall, VoteVets PAC contributed nearly $500,000 to candidates and other PACs during the 2008 election cycle. While VoteVets did not officially endorse a candidate for president in 2008, the group did publicly support Barack Obama's plan for Iraq and actively opposed John McCain's campaign for President, despite McCain being an honored war veteran. = 2010 = In 2010, VoteVets endorsed the following candidates for House in the general election: * Bryan Lentz (PA-7) * Tommy Sowers (MO-8) * Manan Trivedi (PA-6) * then-Congressman John Boccieri (OH-16) * then-Congressman Chris Carney (PA-10) * then-Congressman Walt Minnick (ID-1) * then-Congressman Patrick Murphy (PA-8) * then-Congressman, now Senator Gary Peters (MI-9) * then-Congressman Joe Sestak (PA-7) * then-Congressman, now Governor Tim Walz (MN-1) =2012= In 2012, VoteVets endorsed the following candidates for House and Senate in the general election: * Bob Kerry (NE-Senate) * Richard Carmona (AZ-Senate) * Tammy Duckworth (IL-8) * Bill Enyart (IL-12) * Tulsi Gabbard (HI-2) * John Douglass (VA-5) * Brendan Mullen (IN-2) * then- Congressman, now Senator Gary Peters (MI-14) * Manan Trivedi (PA-6) * then- Congressman, now Governor Tim Walz (MN-1) =2014= In 2014, VoteVets endorsed the following candidates for House and Senate in the general election: * then-Congressman, now Senator Gary Peters (MI-Senate) * Senator Jack Reed (RI-Senate) * then-Congresswoman, now Senator Tammy Duckworth (IL-8) * then-Congressman Bill Enyart (IL-12) * Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (HI-2) * Ruben Gallego (AZ-7) * Ted Lieu (CA-33) * Seth Moulton (MA-6) * Kevin Strouse (PA-8) * Wesley Reed (TX-27) * Jerry Cannon (MI-1) * then-Congressman, now Senator Tim Walz (MN-1) * Jim Mowrer (IA-4) * Mark Takai (HI-1) =2016= In 2016, VoteVets endorsed the following candidates for House and Senate in the general election: * then-Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth (IL-Senate) * then- Secretary of State Jason Kander (MO-Senate) * Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (HI-2) * then-Congressman, now Governor Tim Walz (MN-1) * Congressman Ruben Gallego (AZ-7) * Congressman Ted Lieu (CA-33) * Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-6) * Anthony Brown (MD-4) * Jim Mowrer (IA-3) * Doug Applegate (CA-49) * Mike Derrick (NY-21) * John Plumb (NY-23) * Salud Carbajal (CA-24) * DuWayne Gregory (NY-2) * Jimmy Panetta (CA-20) Additionally, the group endorsed a number of candidates for Governor: * Governor John Bel Edwards (LA) * then-Lt.

Additionally, the group endorsed a number of candidates for Governor: * then-Congressman Tim Walz (MN) * David Garcia (AZ) * James Smith (SC) Action Fund VoteVets.org Action Fund, the group's non-profit wing, has also been active in the paid airwaves. The first ad generated by the action fund was an ad critical of then-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, for \\"failing to ask the tough questions\\" on the war. The group ran a newspaper ad and radio ad, featuring Jeremy Broussard, in Connecticut. The Action Fund also commissioned a 2006 poll, conducted by pollster Celinda Lake, of troops who had returned from Iraq. That poll found many troops did not feel they were given what they needed to succeed in Iraq, and even more had faced medical, mental, and financial hardship when they returned home. The action fund ran a television ad that gained national prominence titled, \\"Because of Iraq.\\" That ad was notable because it included the image of another television ad, featuring Osama bin Laden, produced by the Republican National Committee, commonly referred to as the \\"ticking time bomb\\" ad. The ad from VoteVets begins with a series of veterans of the war explaining what they felt was a negative impact of the war in Iraq. For example, one veteran said, \\"Because of Iraq, there are more terrorists in the world.\\" At the end of the VoteVets ad, General Wesley Clark says, \\"So if you see commercials telling you to be afraid of terrorism, remember: It's because of Iraq.\\" In a series of ads that may have received the most attention for the group, VoteVets.org presented three generals, two of whom were commanders on the ground in Iraq, who became critical of President Bush's execution of the war. Those were Major General (ret.) John Batiste, Major General (ret.) Paul Eaton, and General Wesley Clark. Major General Batiste had commanded the First Infantry Division in Iraq, and Major General Eaton had been the first to be in command of rebuilding Iraqi Defense Forces after the fall of the Saddam regime. Those ads ran in the districts of Congressmen and Senators that the group felt were ready to abandon the President on the war. In fact, four targets of the ad were part of the so-called \\"gang of eleven\\" Republicans who went to the White House to complain to President Bush about the war, right after the ad aired. Though some claimed the targets of the ad were \\"vulnerable Republicans,\\" some of the targets, including Reps. Fred Upton and Mike Rogers, have easily won reelection in the past, and are considered \\"safe\\" seats. In 2008, the Action Fund undertook two major actions that received national attention. First, the organization, along with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington exposed an internal email from a Department of Veterans Affairs center in Temple, Texas, which read in part, \\"Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans, I'd like to suggest that we refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out. Consider a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, R/O PTSD. The exposing of the email caused Senator Barack Obama to call for hearings, and for Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the Senate, Senator Daniel Akaka, to hold such hearings. The second major action was a public push for a 21st Century GI Bill, which would boost the amount troops received in education benefits. The Action Fund backed the bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senator Jim Webb and Senator Chuck Hagel. As part of the group's efforts, it released an internet video with Brave New Films, urging the passage of the bill, with an attached petition, which received 30,000 signatures, according to the group. It also aired television ads, targeting Senators John McCain and John Cornyn, who did not support the bill. Since that time, VoteVets Action Fund has taken on a large number of other issues, including advocating for the close of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, cutting dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels, taking on predatory lenders that target veterans, repeal of Don‚Äôt Ask Don‚Äôt Tell, and advocating for the Iran Nuclear Deal, with senior advisor Major General (Ret.) Paul Eaton even going so far as to call Senator Tom Cotton‚Äôs attempt to dissuade Iran from entering into the deal as ‚Äúmutinous.‚Äù During the Trump administration, VoteVets Action Fund has taken the lead in opposing reinstatement of the transgender ban, shifting of funds meant for military bases and families to a wall on the southern border, and a military parade for Trump to review. The group also was a leading voice in the effort to rename Army bases that are currently named after Confederate military officers, launching an online video that was retweeted over 33,000 times. PAC Disbursements According to OpenSecrets, VoteVets PAC is both a PAC and Super PAC. It has spent over $11 million in the 2016 election cycle and over $12 million in the 2018 cycle. Chairman's leave of absence In November 2010, Iraq War veteran and chairman of the group, Jon Soltz, announced a one-year leave of absence from the organization to deploy to Iraq, as part of Operation New Dawn. The group continued its work with an interim chairman, Iraq War veteran Ashwin Madia, who was the group's vice chairman since 2009. The rest of the VoteVets.org infrastructure remained the same. On December 12, 2011, Soltz returned as chairman after completing his deployment. General John Batiste video In May 2007, retired Major General John Batiste appeared in a political video for VoteVets.org. As part of a $500,000 campaign, variations of the video were shown in a number of congressional districts and also included two other retired generals: Paul D. Eaton and Wesley K. Clark. Batiste had been an Iraq War news consultant for CBS News. However, following his appearance in the video, CBS stated that appearing in the advertisement violated their contract, and Batiste was asked to \\"vacate his position.\\" See also Other US Veterans groups *Veterans for Peace - American organization founded in 1985 consisting of combat and peacetime veterans who work to promote alternatives to war. *American Legion - A large organization of veterans of the United States armed forces who served in wartime.

Its over- expansion‚Äîby purchasing over 100 McMahan's Furniture stores based in Carlsbad, California, in 1993, as well as other stores and chains in the West‚Äîcontributed to its failure. The company also bought the L. Fish furniture chain in the Chicago area; those stores were closed in 1999. Heilig-Meyers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 17, 2000,' and subsequently announced the liquidation of its inventory. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported in 2000 that the company failed when its large expansion did not succeed in creating sufficient revenue and when customers who had previously used the company's in-house credit began using credit cards instead. The company's credit customers had grown increasingly weary of lower quality. All of its stores were closed at the end of the year, except for its RoomStore- branded locations, which remained open. In 2005, RoomStore, the only part of Heilig-Meyers remaining, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after receiving $35,000,000 to pay off its debts;Room Store emerges from bankruptcy protection - Washington Business Journal: RoomStore would be liquidated seven years later.

At its demise, the company had a total debt of S$480 million, and all its shares held by 5,500 shareholders were found to be worthless overnight. As of 2000, it remains the largest corporate collapse in Singapore's history, and the only instance where the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) had to close. The Malaysian Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was also forced to close for three days as a result. In the aftermath of the collapse, key people in the company such as Peter Tham, Tan Kok Liang, and Tan Koon Swan were prosecuted and given varying jail sentences. The collapse of the company shook public confidence in the SES, causing prices of stocks to plunge. New securities laws were introduced in March 1986 to ensure that stockbroking firms can protect themselves against credit risks.

First proposed by Ken Dill in 1985, it is the most known type of lattice protein: it stems from the observation that hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues are the driving force for proteins folding into their native state. All amino acid types are classified as either hydrophobic (H) or polar (P), and the folding of a protein sequence is defined as a self-avoiding walk in a 2D or 3D lattice. The HP model imitates the hydrophobic effect by assigning a negative (favorable) weight to interactions between adjacent, non-covalently bound H residues. Proteins that have minimum energy are assumed to be in their native state. The HP model can be expressed in both two and three dimensions, generally with square lattices, although triangular lattices have been used as well. It has also been studied on general regular lattices. Randomized search algorithms are often used to tackle the HP folding problem. This includes stochastic, evolutionary algorithms like the Monte Carlo method, genetic algorithms, and ant colony optimization. While no method has been able to calculate the experimentally determined minimum energetic state for long protein sequences, the most advanced methods today are able to come close. For some model variants/lattices, it is possible to compute optimal structures (with maximal number of H-H contacts) using constraint programming techniques as e.g. implemented within the CPSP-tools webserver. Even though the HP model abstracts away many of the details of protein folding, it is still an NP-hard problem on both 2D and 3D square lattices. Recently, a Monte Carlo method, named FRESS, was developed and appears to perform well on HP models.

He was known by many other names, including Aragaki Tsuji Pechin Seisho.McCarthy, P. (1997): The Bible of Karate Bubishi (3rd ed., p. 36). Boston, MA: Tuttle Publishing. () Life and martial arts Arakaki was born in 1840 in either Kumemura, on Okinawa Island, or on the nearby island of Sesoko. He was an official in the royal court of Ry≈´ky≈´, and as such held the title of Chikudon Peichin, which denoted a status similar to that of the samurai in Japan. On 24 March 1867, he demonstrated Okinawan martial arts in Shuri, then capital of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom, before a visiting Chinese ambassador; this was a notable event, since experts such as Ank≈ç Asato, Ank≈ç Itosu, and Matsumura S≈çkon were still active at that time. Arakaki served as a Chinese language interpreter, and travelled to Beijing in September 1870. His only recorded martial arts instructor from this period was Wai Xinxian from Fuzhou, a city in the Fujian province of Qing Dynasty China. Arakaki died in 1918. Kata Arakaki was famous for teaching the kata (patterns) Unshu, Seisan, Shihohai, S≈çchin, Niseishi, and Sanchin (which were later incorporated into different styles of karate), and weapons kata Arakaki-no-kun, Arakaki-no-sai, and Sesoku-no-kun. Legacy While Arakaki did not develop any specific styles himself, his techniques and kata are obvious throughout a number of modern karate and kobudo styles. His students included Higaonna Kanry≈ç, founder of Naha-te; Ch≈çjun Miyagi (ÂÆÆÂüé Èï∑È†Ü), founder of G≈çj≈´-ry≈´; Funakoshi Gichin, founder of Shotokan; Uechi Kanbun, founder of Uechi-ry≈´; Kanken T≈çyama, founder of Sh≈´d≈çkan; Mabuni Kenwa, founder of Shit≈ç-ry≈´; and Chitose Tsuyoshi, founder of Chit≈ç-ry≈´. Some consider Chit≈ç-ry≈´ the closest existing style to Arakaki's martial arts, while others have noted that Arakaki's descendants are mostly involved with G≈çj≈´- ry≈´.

Mocsa, church from above Early history The village has existed for at least 770 years; it is first mentioned in 1237-1240 under the name of Mocha in the notes of Albeus, dean of Nitra, who had been asked by B√©la IV of Hungary to catalogue the territories of the villages in the area.Page 9, Gutai Istv√°n (1988). Mocsai Mozaik. During the √Årp√°d Dynasty, the village was a property of the King; income from the land was used to maintain the Queen's court. The King's hunters and falconers lived in Mocsa. In 1291, Fennena of Kujavia, the first wife of Andrew III of Hungary, granted the village's territory to Lodomer, the Archbishop of Esztergom. From this point on, the land was largely the property of the bishops. During the reign of B√©la IV, Mocsa had about four hundred and fifty residents. The villages in the area were mostly razed to the ground during the Tatar invasions, but the survivors helped to repopulate Mocsa by grouping together. Through the centuries the village was attacked on more than one occasion. Its survival is due to its location: a swampy, weedy, low-lying land that was unattractive to the invaders who preferred to travel over hilly lands that gave them a wide view of the places below. Mocsa's location also provided plenty of hiding places for the people and their animals. In times of draught, the residents survived because of their close proximity to water. After the Battle of Moh√°cs, the country suffered with years of taxation and occupation by the Ottoman Turks. Many villages died out entirely, and their territories were connected to the surviving villages‚ÄîMocsa being one of the survivors. Nowadays Mocsa have a great football team (Mocsa FC) with the famous defender L√°szl√≥ Dobai World Wars Five hundred and thirty soldiers from Mocsa took part in World War I. Out of them sixty-one lost their lives. In World War II, there were seven hundred and forty soldiers from the village, two hundred and fifteen who were killed. Between March 18‚Äì26, 1945, Mocsa was liberated by Soviet troops after a bloody battle. The left-over grenades, bombs, and landmines caused troubles for the village in the years to follow. Over twenty people suffered serious injuries from grenade and landmine explosions. Four people were killed in such accidents, including a ten-year- old boy.Page 24, Gutai Istv√°n (1988). Mocsai Mozaik. The Village Churches Mocsa's Roman Catholic church was built in 1756 in the Baroque style. It was burned down along with the village in 1903, but was restored the next year. The Protestant church was built in 1783. It was irrecoverably damaged by cannon blasts during World War II, and so a new church had to be built in 1955. Notes References ‚Ä¢ Gutai Istv√°n (1988).

It is located on the right bank of the Danube. History The history of the village goes back to the prehistoric age: precious findings turned up in its outskirts and the most significant is the Roman material of finds. The village was situated at the limes and it was called Ad Herculem. It was reckoned to be a big colony with a strong fortress and watchtowers. Later the history of the village became intervowen with the religious orders: King B√©la IV donated it to the Benedictines and then King Sigismund endowed the provostship of Esztergom with it. From 1493 till the abolishment of the order it was in the possession of the Paulines. According to the tradition the stream called Malomv√∂lgyi-patak (named after the mills of the village) was the favourite place of King Matthias for rest and feast after the huntings that started from the castle of Visegr√°d. The other stream in the Mikl√≥s-de√°k-valley was said to be frequently visited by the scribe of King Matthias. The mansion standing among trees on the main road was built by Guszt√°v Heckenast in 1860. It is a one-storey villa with wooden pillars built in romantic style. In accordance with the tradition Ferenc De√°k worked out the text of the Compromise of 1867 in this mansion, however it is not proven. It is known that many outstanding people visited this place and almost every famous poets and writers of the era turned up in the villa of the printer. The Catholic church with a frontal tower was built in 1821 in the centre of the village. The statue of the couple Dobozi can be seen on the square in front of the church. Their story says that Mih√°ly Dobozi was escaping with his wife from the Turks who burnt their house down when his horse collapsed. In this hopeless situation Dobozi stabbed his wife at her request then he fell in the inadequate struggle too. This case is attached to the Basaharc-ridge (basaharc means struggle with a pasha). The Calvinist church, which is the oldest building of the village, was built on the hilltop and can be seen from a great distance. Originally a catholic church built for the Paulines on a medieval base, it was put into the possession of the Calvinists in 1786 when the so-called \\"Hatter King\\" Emperor Joseph II dissolved the religious orders. The beach of the village has been popular for long time because it has been one of the best beaches at the Hungarian reach of the Danube. It was also called the Lido of the Danube from the 1930s and summer resorts were established here.

It forecasts the downfall of Western civilization due to internal weaknesses and Muslim population growth in Western countries and the world generally. Based on his own observations, Steyn says that the fall of the Western world is caused by three factors: demographic decline, unsustainability of the advanced Western social democratic state, and exhaustion of civilization. By 2007, Steyn's America Alone, had already convinced many American conservatives that there was an imminent and inevitable Muslim invasion. The Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) filed Human rights complaints against Maclean's magazine‚Äîin which they accused the magazine of Islamophobia‚Äîwith the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal and the Ontario Human Rights Commission, based partly on Maclean's publication of a chapter from Steyn's book, \\"The Future Belongs to Islam\\". Overview In America Alone, which is set in the context of the global war on terror, Steyn argues that \\"much of what we loosely call the Western world will not survive the twenty- first century, and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most European countries.\\" According to a July 1, 2007 The New Republic article, Steyn says that white people \\"are too self-absorbed to breed\\", while the Muslim population is increasing rapidly‚Äîthe 20 million European Muslims in 2006, will have increased to over 150 million by 2015. As a result, there will be a \\"large-scale evacuation operations circa 2015\\". Europe will cede to Al Qaeda and \\"Greater France\\" will \\"remorselessly evolve into Greater Bosnia.\\" Steyn attributes the forecast fall of the Western world to three factors, demographic decline, unsustainability of the advanced Western social-democratic state, and exhaustion of civilization. Steyn based his argument of population decline on his own observation that European nations have low birth rates while Muslim nations have higher birth rates. Steyn wrote that in the 2000s, the population of the developed world declined from about 30% of world population to around 20%, while the population of Muslim nations increased from about 15% to 20%. He argued that the advanced Western social-democratic state was unsustainable, based on his observation that the responsibilities of normal adults‚Äîsuch as care of the elderly, childcare, health care and insurance, have been slowly taken over by the state. Steyn argues that these programs erode humanity's basic sense of self- reliance to a point at which a more resilient group of people ‚Äî Muslims in his view ‚Äî will take control. He said that civilization is exhausted because Western nations are so focused on moral and cultural relativism‚Äîwith \\"diversity\\" and \\"racism\\" as their new favorite words‚Äîthat they are unable to see that their existence is threatened. Specifically, he argues that European nations have given up defending themselves and rely on America for their defense. He views anti-Americanism as a symptom of civilizational exhaustion, whether manifested by Muslims (to whom America symbolizes gay porn, children born out of wedlock, immodest women, and immorality) or by Europeans (to whom America symbolises a crude and radical Christianity, fat rednecks and uncontrolled firearms). However, in his view America is the most benign hegemonic power the world has ever seen. According to Steyn, America will be the last and only country‚Äîas all others will be taken over by Muslims‚Äîthat will retain its sense of self-preservation, but this is not a given, as America's enemies know that it ran from Vietnam and they hope that America will continue to flee when faced with a challenge. Steyn's final argument is that the Muslim world will not need to carry out an outright attack. Instead, Europe will collapse from \\"wimpiness\\" or \\"multicultural 'sensitivity,'\\" leading to betrayal of the state's core values. Thus, during the Danish 'cartoon jihad' of 2006, Jack Straw, then British foreign secretary, hailed the 'sensitivity' of Fleet Street in not reprinting the offending representations of the Prophet.\\" In a 2016 post on his personal blog, \\"Ten Years, and Slightly Less Alone\\", Steyn wrote that his book America Alone was still the \\"biggest story of our time\\". He said that, \\"the west's leaders still can't talk about it, not to their own peoples, not honestly....I'm glad I brought up the subject. And it's well past time for others to speak out\\". Steyn cites Robert D. Kaplan, author of The Coming Anarchy, who has called countries and regions where \\"scarcity, crime, overpopulation, tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet\\", \\"Indian territory.\\" Steyn also refers to Thomas P. M. Barnett's 2006 book, Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating, in which he examines potential relations between the United States and Iran, Iraq, and the Middle East, China and North Korea, Latin America and Africa in the post-9/11 world. Steyn says that the \\"difference between the old Indian territory and the new is this: no one had to worry about the Sioux riding down Fifth Avenue. Today, with a few hundred bucks on his ATM card, the fellow from the badlands can be in the heart of the metropolis within hours. Here‚Äôs another difference: in the old days, the white man settled the Indian territory. Now the followers of the badland‚Äôs radical imams settle the metropolis. And another difference: technology. In the old days, the Injuns had bows and arrows and the cavalry had rifles. In today‚Äôs Indian territory, countries that can‚Äôt feed their own people have nuclear weapons.\\" Steyn dismisses the danger of climate change, The Population Bomb, The Limits to Growth, and nuclear winter. Critical reception The New Republic article said that by 2007, Steyn's America Alone, had already convinced the readers of the National Review‚Äîwhich he called \\"the bible of American conservatism\\"‚Äîof an imminent and inevitable Muslim invasion. In his 2007 City Journal review, Christopher Hitchens praised the book as \\"an admirably tough-minded book.\\" Hitchens said that, \\"Mark Steyn's book is essentially a challenge to the bien-pensants among us: an insistence that we recognize an extraordinary threat and thus the possible need for extraordinary responses. He need not pose as if he were the only one with the courage to think in this way.\\" The British novelist Martin Amis also reviewed the book in The Times and called Steyn as the \\"great sayer of the unsayable\\". Amis added, \\"I continue to hope that his admonitions will gain some momentum, despite the efforts of his prose style to impede it.\\" Then President of the United States, George W. Bush, circulated copies to his White House staff after reading Steyn's book. According to Steyn, it was also read by Democrat vice- presidential nominee Joe Lieberman and Spanish prime minister Jos√© Maria Aznar. In a 2007 Spectator review by British politician and prominent Brexit campaigner, Michael Gove, he wrote that the fact that \\"many of Steyn's conclusions will be unpalatable to the European consensus only underlines how much a failure to face harsh truths has characterised the European response to the scale of the terrorist threat we face.\\" Daniel Johnson said that Steyn is as \\"damning as he is persuasive: from demographic suicide to the abdication of self-defence, he conducts a forensic analysis of the hollowing out of the high culture for which the Continent was still respected a generation ago.\\" Canadian newspaper publisher and author, Conrad Black in his review of Steyn's follow-up book After America: Get Ready for Armageddon referred to America Alone as extolling \\"...America‚Äôs heroic status as the chief and only plausible resister to the degeneration of the West and the endless primitive depredations of militant Islam, carried out with the mischievous connivance of a greedy and malevolent China.\\" Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting criticized the book as \\"inarguably Islamophobic,\\" and author Suhayl Saadi in the Independent referred to it as \\"hysterical\\". In a March 2013 Ethnic and Racial Studies journal article, Nasar Meer wrote that the book was, \\"Remarkably similar to anxieties over western decline in the late 19th century.\\"  Human rights complaints  In December 2007, Mohamed Elmasry of the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) filed Human rights complaints against Maclean's magazine with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal and the Ontario Human Rights Commission, accusing the magazine of publishing eighteen Islamophobic articles between January 2005 and July 2007. The articles in question included a column by Mark Steyn titled \\"The future belongs to Islam\\"‚Äîan excerpt from America Alone. The CIC said that Steyn's column was \\"flagrantly Islamophobic\\" and that it subjected Canadian Muslims to \\"hatred and contempt\\". The CIC's request for \\"equal space\\" to publish a response in Macleans was refused. The CIC also filed a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. The Ontario Federation of Labour, with its 700,000 members, put pressure on all relevant parties, including Macleans' parent company, in support of the CIC complaint. The Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the complaint in June 2008 and issued a ruling on October 10, 2008 dismissing the complaint. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the federal complaint on June 26, 2008 without referring the matter to a tribunal. The case has been cited as a motivating factor in the repeal of Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. America Alone The title of Steyn's 2007 book echoes that of the best- selling Cambridge University Press scholarly 2005 publication by American Studies in the Department of Politics and International Studies' director, Stefan Halper, and Daniel Jonathan Clarke, entitled, America Alone: The Neo- Conservatives and the Global Order which is also set in the context of the War on Terror. Halper and Clarke trace the early rise to prominence and influence of a small group of \\"radical intellectuals\\"‚Äîthe neoconservatives. The authors described how the neoconservatives succeeded in changing the global order by gaining control over American national security policy during the War on Terror. They persuaded then-President George W. Bush to abandon the bi- partisan diplomatic approach that had been used successfully against the Soviet threat since the 1950s, and to replace the consensus-driven approach with a neo-conservative foreign policy that promoted military confrontation and 'nation-building'.

Roberts, a general authority and Assistant Church Historian of the LDS Church. It should not be confused with the seven-volume History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (nicknamed Documentary History of the Church), which was also edited by Roberts in the early 20th-century but focuses on the history of Joseph Smith.  Background  After the American Historical Magazine, owned by the American Historical Society, published articles on the Spalding‚ÄìRigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship, Roberts requested the magazine also allow him to publish a rebuttal. After his four-part response, the editor was so pleased that he invited Roberts to next write a detailed history of the LDS Church. The magazine was willing to change its frequency and format to accommodate the size of this task. From July 1909 to July 1915 Roberts wrote \\"The History of the Mormon Church\\" in forty-two-page installments for each issue of the newly named Americana magazine (sometimes called Americana Illustrated). After the final article appeared, the First Presidency wanted to publish the work in six volumes, but this was dropped due to the cost, despite Roberts' willingness. He even considered condensing the material into a single volume after Joseph Fielding Smith's one-volume Essentials in Church History was authorized for publication. In 1928 Apostle George Albert Smith asked Roberts to revisit and update his work for publication in commemoration of the church's 1930 centennial. For this reference work used by members of the church, a separate index volume was published in 1959 by the Brigham Young University Library.  Reception  The Comprehensive History has been called \\"Roberts's most important historical labor\\" and \\"his magnum opus.\\" It is seen as the \\"high-water mark\\" of historical studies before the academics of the New Mormon History and was \\"far superior to any history of Mormonism which had yet appeared.\\" It was the first to publish some major portions of recent history and to chronicle so wide a period of the Mormon past in one work. It referenced copious primary and secondary sources and sought to reject historical myths, \\"the untruth, the spectacular, the bizarre\\" that was \\"based on worthless testimony\\". However, the work has been criticized for manifesting a strong Mormon bias and using Romantic, \\"rhapsodic prose that sometimes overshoots the mark.\\"  Volumes summary  *Volume I :Joseph Smith's early history until the church's experience in Missouri *Volume II :Settlement in Illinois up unto the exodus from Illinois *Volume III :The pioneer trek up until federal intervention in Salt Lake City *Volume IV :Various events in Utah in the 1850s *Volume V *Volume VI :Events leading up to the Manifesto and other events to 1930 See also *Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, a biographical dictionary of the LDS Church from 1830 to 1930  Notes  References *.

He is also known as one of the founders of the Kyoto Sangyo University. Biography =Early career= Iwakuro was born on Kurahashi-jima in the Inland Sea (then part of Aki County, Hiroshima prefecture). Although he grew up on the island neighboring Etajima (where the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy was located), Iwakuro had no interest in a naval career, and was sent for schooling to a military academy in Nagoya. He graduated from the 30th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1918, and was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment, based at Shibata city in the Hokuetsu region of Japan. In September 1920, Iwakuro's regiment was assigned as part of the Japanese expeditionary force participating in the Siberian Intervention, and Iwakuro participated in numerous combat missions against Bolshevik partisans. In 1921, Iwakuro was transferred to the Taiwan Army of Japan, and was based in Taichung. He returned to mainland Japan in 1926 to attend the 38th class of the Army War College (Japan), and it was shortly after graduation that he became a member of the Sakura Kai ultranationalist secret society. In 1932, he was transferred to Manchuria shortly after the Manchurian Incident and assigned to the Kwantung Army, where he held a number of staff positions and was actively involved in planning the independence of Manchukuo, and its future economic development under Imperial Japanese Army management. =Spymaster= Iwakuro was recalled to Japan shortly after the February 26 Incident of 1936, and was a member of the court martial of the perpetrators. He was then assigned to Army Intelligence, where he oversaw the wiretapping of foreign embassies, interception of mail and correspondence and the production of counterfeit money for use in future operations. In 1937, he was transferred to the newly created 8th Section of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and was tasked with planning the independence of Wang Jingwei's Nanjing Nationalist Chinese government. In 1938, he was on the committee which established the Nakano School, Japan's training school for intelligence and counter-intelligence agents. From 1939-1941, Iwakuro was Chief of Army Affairs Section in the Military Affairs Bureau, where his primary task was military procurement. Using the Tripartite Alliance, Iwakuro strongly pressed Nazi Germany to share military technologies, particularly in terms of armor and aviation-related technologies. He also established a research facility to investigate new technologies, such as microwaves, for potential military applications. Iwakuro, unlike many in the Japanese Army senior staff, was always strongly against war with the Soviet Union (Hokushin-ron) and was conversely a strong proponent of the Nanshin-ron philosophy as were many senior offices in the Imperial Japanese Navy. With the defeat of the Japanese Army at Nomonhan Iwakuro became more outspoken in favor of the concept of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the need for Japan to prepare for total war. =Diplomat= Iwakuro was sent as military attach√© to the United States in 1941 over the objections of Foreign Minister Y≈çsuke Matsuoka. However, the Army's position was that Matsuoka was too inexperienced in foreign affairs, and needed additional training. Iwakuro was a close adviser of Japanese ambassador Admiral Kichisabur≈ç Nomura in the Washington negotiations just before the outbreak of the Pacific War.Review Of The Diplomatic Conversations He was withdrawn after the formation of a new cabinet under Hideki T≈çj≈ç in August 1941, and was named Commanding Officer of the 5th Imperial Guards Regiment. But, according to John Toland, The Rising Sun, volume one, page 85, \\"The former (previous sentence referenced Matsuoka) suggested that Ikawa sound out the army in the person of an influential colonel in the War Ministry named Hideo Iwakuro.John Toland, The Rising Sun, page85. =Command and Staff appointments= After the start of the Pacific War, the 5th Imperial Guards Regiment came under the command of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, and was assigned to Malaya and Singapore. While in Singapore, Iwakuro became head of the I Kikan, and was senior liaison officer with the Indian National Army.Lebra, Japanese-trained Armies of Southeast Asia In 1943, Iwakuro was promoted to Vice Chief of Staff of the Twenty-Fifth Army. He subsequently became Chief of Staff of the Twenty-Eighth Army in Burma in 1944-5.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Recalled to Japan before the end of the war, Iwakuro was attached to Army Ordnance Administrative Headquarters in 1945, and was Head of Army Investigation Department at the time of the end of the war. After the war, in 1965, Iwakuro became one of the founders of the Kyoto Sangyo University. He died in 1970 of a heart attack.

History  =Prehistory= V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës sits at the foot of the Gerecse Mountains, which were at one point in the sea. At the bottom of this sea, many fossils accumulated, including that of a Homo erectus individual that is now known as Samu.History of V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës, vertesszolos.hu =Recent history= For most of its history, V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës has been constantly inhabited by different peoples, including Celts, Romans, Avars, Moravians, and Hungarians. According to legend, it was near V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës that Svatopluk I of Moravia and √Årp√°d fought. At the beginning of the 18th century, the village had several Lords, who recruited Slovakian- speaking serfs to settle the land. These settlers radically transformed the landscape; they drained the marshes, cut forests to make pastures, and brought sheep into the territory. By the end of the 18th century, the Slovakian settlers decided to build a church, which was completed in 1792. In 1809, Napoleon's armies invaded Hungary, and ramparts were built in V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës. In World War 1, 236 inhabitants of the village fought, of which 32 died and 7 became invalids. In 1929, the names of the fallen were recorded on the Hero Memorial which stands in front of the village's church. This was also the year that the village's school was built. In World War 2, 23 soldiers from the village died. The front passed through the village twice, causing many buildings to be damaged. In 1944, the parish priest of the village died, and the pastor died a year later in January 1945. It wasn't until March 1945 that the Soviet forces displaced the German occupants from V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës. Between 1990 and 1994 the settlement grew with several newly built public institutions: a sports hall, a football field, a new school building, a health house, and a pharmacy had been built. After Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, from 2006 onwards, the EU development funds, more significant than the previous ones, provided new impetus to the development of V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës.

It began a transition from El Comite (a community based mass organization) to MINP - Movimiento de Izquierda Nacional Puertorriquena (a movement guided by the principles of Marxism- Leninism) in 1975. The organization defined itself as the Revolutionary Left current within the broad range of political tendencies that existed within the Puerto Rican community living in the United States. It sought to create a unified multinational-multiracial Revolutionary Political Movement in America and gain the support of the Puertorriquen National Minority in the United States for this political movement. Together with several other organizations, it was one of several Pro-Puertorriquen Independence organizations that formed at a time when the United States was coming under increasing international criticism for holding onto the world's oldest colony.Navarro, Sharon Ann, and Mejia, Armando Xavier, Latino Americans and Political Participation Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2004. . page 106.

Operational Model  El Comit√© sought to be a multi-issue organization, offering a comprehensive program for the community. Besides its community roles, the group collaborated with a student sector, the Puerto Rican Student Union (PRSU), and a workers organization, and initiated a process that eventually led to the formation of the Latin Women's Collective. Through its publication Unidad Latina, it addressed the gamut of issues affecting the community, linking local issues to international forces.Velazquez, Jose. Another West Side Story.

Bernard Fleetwood-Walker (invariably known as B. Fleetwood-Walker) was born on 22 March 1893 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, a twin and one of five children. His father William Walker was an electrical engineer and co-inventor of the Walker-Wilkins battery, while his mother Electra Amelia (n√©e Varley) was granddaughter of the 19th century watercolourist Cornelius Varley who, together with his brother John Varley, had been amongst the founder members of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1804. Fleetwood-Walker was educated at Barford Street School and at King Edward‚Äôs Grammar School, Five Ways and went on to train in the arts as a silver and goldsmith. Through working as a modeller and on low relief he developed an interest in painting and furthered his studies at the Birmingham School of Art and Crafts, as well as in London and under Fleury in Paris. During the First World War he served in France as a sniper in the Artists Rifles and was wounded and gassed. Various studies exist showing he continued to draw while in the army and a fellow soldier, years later in a letter to the artist‚Äôs widow, described mural decorations he painted for Christmas 1918 on the wall of a warehouse being used as a mess-hall in the deserted village of Auberchicourt, near Douai, using dry colours found in a builder‚Äôs yard mixed with ‚Äòthe glutinous substance you get from oatmeal porridge‚Äô. These materials were ‚Äòfood and drink to him‚Äô and he regarded the war years as wasted time. Returning to Birmingham after the war he married Marjorie White (‚ÄòMickey‚Äô) in 1920 and had two sons, Colin and Guy. He taught, first at King Edward‚Äôs Grammar School, Aston where added to his talents he designed remarkably avant- garde scenery for the school plays, and then, from 1929 as a gifted, respected and influential lecturer at the Birmingham College of Art under Harold Holden. Having been trained at a time when strong drawing and a high level of technical skill was the pre-requisite of a successful career, he excelled as a draughtsman and through his teaching encouraged these virtues in others. He encouraged his students to use every sort of medium to hand, doled out fierce criticism and demanded high standards, and at the same time lectured perceptively on contemporary art movements. He worked prodigiously during this time, exhibiting at the Royal Academy from 1925, developing his abilities as a practising artist and quickly gaining a reputation not only as a painter of portraits and children but also for the large figurative paintings of the 1930s, many of which are now in public collections. He had a one-man exhibition at the Ruskin Gallery, Birmingham in 1927, but showed his work primarily at the societies to which he regularly sent his work. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1946 and a Royal Academician in 1956 - showing a total of 147 works there over the years. He was a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the New English Art Club. Always extremely loyal to his hometown, he declared he was proud to be the only Royal Academician from Birmingham who still lived and worked there, and was particularly pleased to have been elected President of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) in 1950. In 1946 Fleetwood- Walker was elected to the Royal Watercolour Society consequently fulfilling the conditions of Cornelius Varley‚Äôs will - that the next artist in his family to be a member should inherit Varley‚Äôs studio collection. After his first wife died, he married Dr Peggy Frazer in 1939 and continued to work and teach in Birmingham through to 1956. Each year he would take a group of students from Birmingham to sketch in Cornwall and was a member of the St Ives Society of Artists (1936-1949). He also went on sketching tours on the continent and exhibited at the Paris Salon winning both bronze and silver medals. He finally moved to Chelsea so that he could devote more time to the students at the Royal Academy School where he was Assistant Keeper. He died in London on 30 January 1965. In the introductory essay of the catalogue to the Memorial Exhibition held at the RBSA in 1965, Richard Seddon described his work as follows: ‚ÄòHe allowed his style to develop to the full and kept moving throughout his active life as an artist; and from the drawing and painting of a conceptual clarity based on his disciplined skill with line, he progressed to a visual intensity that synthesised light, space and tactile qualities as unified images laid on the canvas with a spontaneity and breadth unsurpassed by many of his British contemporaries.‚Äô References External links  www.fleetwood-walker.co.uk, a searchable archive of Bernard Fleetwood-Walker's drawings and finished works by Nicola Walker and Chris Quirk Category:1893 births Category:1965 deaths Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:Royal Academicians Category:Members and Associates of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists Category:Artists' Rifles soldiers Category:Artists from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Alumni of the Birmingham School of Art Category:Academics of the Birmingham School of Art ","title":"Bernard Fleetwood-Walker"},{"id":"11185530","text":"The Douve or Ouve is a river, in length, which rises in the commune of Tollevast, near Cherbourg in the department of Manche. Ouve is considered its old name (Unva in ancient texts): Ouve appears to have been misspelled over the course of time as \\"Douve river\\" and then as \\"River of the Douve\\" (Douve literally means Ditch). The French name for this watercourse is la Douve. After passing Tollevast, the river proceeds through the hills of the Cotentin peninsula (Cherbourg peninsula) and goes by Sottevast, l'√âtang-Bertrand and Magneville. It borders N√©hou and crosses Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Once it reaches Bauptois, it alters its direction towards the Bay of the Seine in the south-eastern English Channel, passing through Carentan. The Douve is a navigable river owing to its flat bottom and adequate depth of flow. In 1944 German troops, preparing Rommel's Fortress Europa, flooded the valley to prevent landing paratroops or gliders. On D-Day, the river was the boundary between the left flank of Allied landing forces on Utah Beach (on its left bank and so to the west nearest Roune) and the bloody defensive battle that occurred at Omaha Beach. The Utah beach landings were part of contingency planning only scheduled after ample landing craft became available and designed to give the allies a leg up on taking a port city, in this case, Cherbourg, to bolster Allied logistical capacity. Had the landing craft been lacking, the river would have protected the exposed right flank of the allied invasion lodgement. With Utah in the plan, it was used to originate an offensive aimed squarely at the early domination of the peninsula and capture of Cherbourg and Caen (and eventually Rouen) at the opposite end of the lodgement. These cities were well protected by their German defenders. Among those landing at the Douve was the unit known as the Filthy Thirteen, later the basis of the novel and film The Dirty Dozen.

Aerial photography showing outline of Roman Castle Crumerum, Nyerges√∫jfalu The city, located near the river Danube, is an ancient site of habitation. It was located on the Crumerum, a major Roman trade and military route. Late-era Romans built a fort here, to help protect the northern border of their empire. The settlement was later overrun by various tribes and, later still, by invaders from the Ottoman Empire. In the periods of warfare the fort was destroyed. European travelers later noted the fort's ruins; for instance, in the mid-18th century, travel writer Richard Pococke wrote about it. \\"We saw the ruins of the fort, several Roman bricks and elsewhere foundations that seemed to be Roman.\\"Richard Pococke, A Description of the East, and some other countries, in 1745, 2.2. S. 246th The struggle for freedom in the region in the later 18th century resulted in the destruction of most of the fort. A century later, not even remnant stones were visible. In the late 18th century Maria Theresa of Austria recruited German farmers to immigrate to the Danube Valley in order to repopulate it and revive agriculture. It had suffered a decline in population during the period of the Ottoman invasion, aggravated by plagues. The Germans came mostly from southern principalities and were Catholic; they were allowed to keep their language and religion, and established predominately German-speaking towns. They translated the town's name to \\"Sattel- Neudorf\\". The church still standing in the middle of Nyergesujfalu was finished in baroque style in 1770, on land granted to its founders by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Next to the church is the Salesian secondary school, founded by a religious order. Attila J√≥zsef, a noted 20th-century poet, studied here for a short time. In the last few centuries, the local \\"fast riders\\" made the town's name famous. Simon K√©zai wrote about the town in his chronicles, referring to it as \\"Nyergedszeg.\\" Under differing regimes, it was later changed to \\"Ujfalu\\" and, more recently, has been spelled as \\"Nyergesujfalu.\\" Following World War II, many ethnic Germans were expelled from Hungary and other parts of eastern Europe, as Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had used them as an excuse for warfare. He had said he wanted to reunite ethnic Germans throughout Europe, under the rule of Germany, although these and others in Hungary had lived as Hungarians for more than 200 years. In the late 20th century, the site of the Roman earthwork fort was rediscovered through aerial photography, which revealed its outlines. Some archeological excavations have been conducted at the site. They have established the original size of the fort and other details. It has become a destination for tourists and hikers. The latter also take advantage of hills and trails in the region. Nyerges√∫jfalu officially became a city in 1989. The city is associated with the noted 20th-century painter K√°roly Kernstok (1873‚Äì1940), who inherited a house in Nyerges√∫jfalu and lived here for several years. He was the center of an artistic community in Budapest known as The Eight (Nyolcak) (1909-1918), who created the modernist movement in Hungarian art.\\"Hungarian Hunt from Paris to Nagyb√°nya, 1900-1914\\", Art Knowledge News, Hungarian National Museum, accessed 15 Sep 2010 International relations =Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities= Nyerges√∫jfalu is twinned with: * Neu Wulmstorf, Germany * Karlsdorf-Neuthard, Germany * Mu≈æla, Slovakia References External links * in Hungarian * Street map * \\"Nyerges√∫jfalu\\", Tourist guide webpage * www.ungarndeutsche.de Category:Populated places in Kom√°rom-Esztergom County Category:Hungarian German communities Hungarian Germans ","title":"Nyerges√∫jfalu"},{"id":"11185533","text":"L√°batlan () is a town in Kom√°rom-Esztergom county, Hungary.

Born in London and migrated to New Zealand, Adams was taught violin by his mother. By the time he left school at 16 he was playing in the Wellington Symphonia. He auditioned for the National Orchestra trainee section, but failed because of his poor sight-reading, having learned to play by ear. The Nairobi Trio In 1989 Adams and John Quigley formed the Nairobi Trio. The trio consists of Adams (violin/vocals), Quigley (guitar/vocals), and Peter Koopman (bass/vocals). They play improvised jazz and re-worked standard jazz pieces. They are best known for their original compositions. On tour they perform as a quartet with Andrew Dixon on saxophones/flute/vocals. The trio's name was chosen as a bit of a joke because none of the members came from Nairobi. Adams received critical acclaim with the jazz group Neon Quaver. He played with his own Richard Adams Quartet and flautist Paul Horn at the Wellington International Arts Festival. Film and book In 1977 Adams co- scripted, co-produced, and co-directed the New Zealand feature film Artman which was released at Wellington Film Festival in July 1979. In 1979 he published Translations, a book of poems and etchings. From 1982 to 1988 Adams was head scenic artist for the New Zealand Film Industry. In 1988 he co- founded Pro Art, specialising in commissioned artworks and sculptural pieces. Adams' first studio in 1979 was the dome that was built in the garden at Rita Angus' cottage in Wellington before it became a residence for painters. Adams worked in the kitchen. When he moved to Auckland he rented the Gillies Ave studio that belonged to painter Louise Henderson. Later he worked in writer Barry Crump's former studio in Devonport. Adams first exhibited his works in 1982 at the Molesworth Gallery in Wellington. Since then his work has been exhibited in Tokyo, Sydney, New York, London and more recently at Gallery Thirty Three in Wanaka, The Arthouse in Christchurch, and the McPherson Gallery in Auckland. In 2004 Adams was appointed Resident Artist, Chambre Avec Vue, Saignon, France.

Having been admitted to the ministry in 1663, he settled as pastor with the church of Esperance, in the diocese of Castres. In 1670 he accepted an invitation to the church of La Caune, in the same diocese, where he officiated till the revocation of the edict of Nantes, in 1685. In 1686, the magistrates of Deventer invited him to become professor of divinity and pastor of the Walloon church in that city; but the regency of Utrecht, where he had taken up his residence, fully apprised of his merit, prevailed upon him to accept the office of pastor in their city. He had studied his native language grammatically; and when the French Academy was about to publish the second edition of their Dictionary, he sent them remarks and observations, of which they availed themselves, with polite acknowledgments to the author.

Growth in development The growth rate is very high for industries here, due to a well developed infrastructure in Joya. The Delhi‚ÄìMumbai Industrial Corridor Project is a state-sponsored industrial development project aimed at developing an industrial zone spanning across six states in India. The project will see major expansion of infrastructure and industry ‚Äì including industrial clusters and rail, road, port, air connectivity ‚Äì in the states along the route of the corridor. The ambitious Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) has received major boost with India and Japan inking an agreement to set up a project development fund. The initial size of the fund will be Rs 1,000 Crore (about $212 million). Both the Japanese and Indian governments contribute equally. The corridor would include six mega investment regions of 200 square kilometers each and will run through seven states: Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh, southern Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, eastern Gujarat, and western Maharashtra. Indrapuram-Moradabad- Kashipur-Haldwani is one of the investment regions selected for development in the first phase of the ambitious Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. More than 59 per cent of Western Uttar Pradesh's area comes under the project area of this ambitious DMIC project, which is extended up to 150 km on both sides of the alignment of the Delhi-Mumbai Dedicated Freight Corridor. This would open a floodgate of opportunities all along NH-58, NH-2, Yamuna Expressway and NH-24 for developing industrial, urban and supporting infrastructure through public-private initiatives, seven investment regions and 13 industrial areas have been planned along this Corridor and Hapur-Moradabad-Rudrapur-Khatima is one of the investment regions selected for development in the first phase.

By extension, ISM includes information risk management, a process which involves the assessment of the risks an organization must deal with in the management and protection of assets, as well as the dissemination of the risks to all appropriate stakeholders. This requires proper asset identification and valuation steps, including evaluating the value of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and replacement of assets. As part of information security management, an organization may implement an information security management system and other best practices found in the ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, and ISO/IEC 27035 standards on information security. Risk management and mitigation Managing information security in essence means managing and mitigating the various threats and vulnerabilities to assets, while at the same time balancing the management effort expended on potential threats and vulnerabilities by gauging the probability of them actually occurring. A meteorite crashing into a server room is certainly a threat, for example, but an information security officer will likely put little effort into preparing for such a threat. After appropriate asset identification and valuation has occurred, risk management and mitigation of risks to those assets involves the analysis of the following issues: * Threats: Unwanted events that could cause the deliberate or accidental loss, damage, or misuse of information assets * Vulnerabilities: How susceptible information assets and associated controls are to exploitation by one or more threats * Impact and likelihood: The magnitude of potential damage to information assets from threats and vulnerabilities and how serious of a risk they pose to the assets; cost‚Äìbenefit analysis may also be part of the impact assessment or separate from it * Mitigation: The proposed method(s) for minimizing the impact and likelihood of potential threats and vulnerabilities Once a threat and/or vulnerability has been identified and assessed as having sufficient impact/likelihood to information assets, a mitigation plan can be enacted. The mitigation method chosen largely depends on which of the seven information technology (IT) domains the threat and/or vulnerability resides in. The threat of user apathy toward security policies (the user domain) will require a much different mitigation plan than one used to limit the threat of unauthorized probing and scanning of a network (the LAN-to-WAN domain). =Information security management system= An information security management system (ISMS) represents the collation of all the interrelated/interacting information security elements of an organization so as to ensure policies, procedures, and objectives can be created, implemented, communicated, and evaluated to better guarantee an organization's overall information security. This system is typically influenced by organization's needs, objectives, security requirements, size, and processes. An ISMS includes and lends to effective risk management and mitigation strategies. Additionally, an organization's adoption of an ISMS largely indicates that it is systematically identifying, assessing, and managing information security risks and \\"will be capable of successfully addressing information confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.\\" However, the human factors associated with ISMS development, implementation, and practice (the user domain) must also be considered to best ensure the ISMS' ultimate success. Implementation and education strategy components Implementing effective information security management (including risk management and mitigation) requires a management strategy that takes note of the following: * Upper-level management must strongly support information security initiatives, allowing information security officers the opportunity \\"to obtain the resources necessary to have a fully functional and effective education program\\" and, by extension, information security management system. * Information security strategy and training must be integrated into and communicated through departmental strategies to ensure all personnel are positively affected by the organization's information security plan. * A privacy training and awareness \\"risk assessment\\" can help an organization identify critical gaps in stakeholder knowledge and attitude towards security. * Proper evaluation methods for \\"measuring the overall effectiveness of the training and awareness program\\" ensure policies, procedures, and training materials remain relevant. * Policies and procedures that are appropriately developed, implemented, communicated, and enforced \\"mitigate risk and ensure not only risk reduction, but also ongoing compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, and policies.\\" * Milestones and timelines for all aspects of information security management help ensure future success. Without sufficient budgetary considerations for all the above‚Äîin addition to the money allotted to standard regulatory, IT, privacy, and security issues‚Äîan information security management plan/system can not fully succeed. Relevant standards Standards that are available to assist organizations with implementing the appropriate programs and controls to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities include the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, the ITIL framework, the COBIT framework, and O-ISM3 2.0. The ISO/IEC 27000 family represent some of the most well-known standards governing information security management and the ISMS and are based on global expert opinion. They lay out the requirements for best \\"establishing, implementing, deploying, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, updating, and improving information security management systems.\\" ITIL acts as a collection of concepts, policies, and best practices for the effective management of information technology infrastructure, service, and security, differing from ISO/IEC 27001 in only a few ways. COBIT, developed by ISACA, is a framework for helping information security personnel develop and implement strategies for information management and governance while minimizing negative impacts and controlling information security and risk management, and O-ISM3 2.0 is The Open Group's technology- neutral information security model for enterprise.

It was originally authored by Walter Pullen, and distributed via postings to the Usenet newsgroup . Astrolog can create horoscopes, natal charts, and calculate current planetary positions in sidereal, traditional, and heliocentric formats. It can be used to relate astrological house and sign dispositors and other nonstandard systems. Astrolog uses 22 different house systems, can calculate 18 different aspects such as trines, squares, semisquares, and rarer ones such as biquintiles, quatronoviles, and sesquiquadrates. Astrolog computes the traditional planets, along with minor planetary objects such as Ceres, Juno and Vesta, and uranian objects such as Vulkanus and Russian Proserpina. It can show nearly 50 fixed stars, and animate the chart in real time synchronized with the OS clock. Astrolog can do forms of locational astrology such as astrocartography. Recent versions use the tz database for time zone and daylight saving time detection. All versions of Astrolog have been distributed with source code, and the most recent versions are free software under the GNU General Public License. Several different parties have contributed to the core program or to alternate versions of it. For example, Astrolog started with the early astrological formulas implemented by Michael Erlewine. Later versions of it made use of the Placalc and then Swiss Ephemeris libraries produced by Astrodienst AG. Other parties contributed PostScript graphics, and integrated ephemeris files for minor planetary objects. Astrolog has been ported to many different platforms, where versions exist for Unix, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, OS/2, and Amiga, among others. Astrolog has also been distributed as sample packages with versions of SUSE Linux. Some consider Astrolog to rival commercial programs in quality. In November 1995, The Mountain Astrologer reviewed a number of software programs, where Astrolog was the one freeware program included, described as \\"good enough to be worthy of review with the main commercial programs\\". In the 1990s, Astrolog was mentioned a number of times in American Astrology's \\"The New Astrology\\" article by Ken Irving, because at the time it was the only readily available program that could compute Gauquelin sectors as described by astrologer Michel Gauquelin. All versions of Astrolog include a command line interface. Most criticism of the program is due to command switches being confusing to memorize or use. Windows and Macintosh versions eventually included standard GUI. The command switch interface allows all of Astrolog's features to be accessed from shell scripts or to be invoked by other programs. There are a number of online servers that use Astrolog as a back end to generate charts for the user.

The company is based in New York City. Pensa Custom Guitars was founded by Argentine businessman Rudy Pensa. History Mark Knopfler playing his custom Pensa MK-2 on tour at the NAC in Ottawa Mark Knopfler with his Pensa MK-90 blue guitar live at Le Z√©nith June 02nd 2015 In 1980, Mark Knopfler and Rudy Pensa met at Rudys Music Stop 48th St New York, a friendship which lasts to today. From 1984 John Suhr began creating guitars at Rudys Music Stop under the R Custom name before later building guitars carrying the Pensa-Suhr moniker. Mark Knopfler began using a number of Pensa Suhr instruments with the intention of the guitar's creation to be able to sound like both a 1961 Fender Stratocaster and a 1958 Gibson Les Paul, guitars that Knopfler played frequently on albums and on tour. Knopfler had grown tired of having to frequently switch between the Stratocaster and the Les Paul during performances, hence the need for a guitar that could sound like both. Knopfler's most famous Caramel Carve Top Pensa Suhr debuted at the 1988 Nelson Mandela concert. Some designs of the guitar were drawn on napkins at a coffee shop not far from Pensa's own place of business. Knopfler didn't like the pickup ring not matching the EMG 85 cream colour so the humbucker was mounted from the rear so a pickup ring was not needed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3SgyZSYz4Y&t;=1627s This served as a basis for a series of Pensa-branded handmade guitars still available from the company: the MK1 (bound mahogany body and neck with a 22-fret Brazilian rosewood fingerboard and carved quilted maple top, Floyd Rose locking tremolo, Sperzel locking tuners, black headstock, gold hardware and an active EMG pickup set with an 85 humbucking bridge pickup and two SA single-coils, master volume and master tone with switchable pull-out \\"presence control\\" mid-boost circuit); MK2 (three Lindy Fralin Blues single-coils, stop tailpiece); and MK80 (three Seymour Duncan Classic Stacks, birdseye maple fingerboard, Gotoh vintage bridge). Knopfler would first record in the studio with the Pensa on Dire Straits' 1991 album On Every Street, and continues to use it in his shows to this day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3SgyZSYz4Y&t;=1627s According to the company's website, the first electric guitar created by Rudy Pensa and John Suhr was called the \\"R Custom\\", built in 1984. Pensa and Suhr built instruments together under the brand name Pensa-Suhr. The two parted ways in March 1990 when Suhr left Pensa's workshops to work for Fender as a Senior Master Builder at the Californian company's Custom Shop and established JS Technologies, Inc. with partner Steve Smith in 1997. The name Suhr was dropped from the brand name after one year for guitars subsequently built under Pensa's stewardship.

Life and work McClure was born in Chicago, Illinois and was the only child of Howe Alexander, a travelling salesman for a food company and Clara Phillips McClure, a gifted pianist. His early schooling was in a number of places including Lewisville, TexasMcClure (1995):19. where his mother moved after her divorce. He took an early interest in insects and read all the works of Jean Henri Fabre while still in his teens. He studied in Seattle, Washington; Lewisville, Texas; and Danville, Illinois (where his father lived with his step-mother). His masters work was in entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he studied under Clell Lee Metcalf. Apart from his regular research he conducted several unusual studies such as a 24-hour watch over a Tetraopes tetraopthalmus beetle, observing all the other insects that approached it and their interactions. He also studied ecology under Victor Ernest Shelford and graduated in June 1933 with high honors, Phi Beta Kappa. On 1 October 1933, he married Lucy Esther Lou Fairchild who he had known from childhood.McClure (1995):54-55. Metcalf wrote to him that if he did not get a job, he should come back to school for another degree. This he did and was taken on by Metcalf but refused by W.P. Flint. For his master's degree he studied aerial insects. He then worked on a Ph.D. in wildlife management at Iowa State University with studies on the mourning dove. He also conducted studies on road-kills in Nebraska. He started bird banding in 1938 and personally banded close to 100,000 birds of 550 species by the end of his life, and may possibly hold the record for number of species ringed. After World War II, when McClure served in the U.S. Navy, he was hired by the State of California to study an outbreak of encephalitis in horses in Bakersfield. As a result of this work, Walter Reed Institutes of Research sent him on a mission to Japan in 1950. McClure went to Japan to study arthropod borne diseases. This work was supported by the US Army, 406 Medical General Laboratory. The work involved collecting bird blood samples for testing viruses.McClure (1995):3. Here McClure discovered that birds that were shot showed blood that appeared to be positive for viruses while those samples examined from blood drawn from mist-netted (mist nets were a Japanese innovation) specimens appeared to be negative. This demonstrated methodological errors and from then on all samples were collected only from traps.McClure (1995):125. In 1958 McLure moved to Japan where he worked as an ornithologist for the US Army Medical Research Unit. This led in 1963 to a major project to study migratory birds in Asia with funding by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). This was called the \\"Migratory Animal Pathological Survey\\" (MAPS) and it went on for 8 years and in 18 countries, including Thailand and Japan. This was continued until his retirement in 1975. The program banded 1,165,288 birds of 1,218 species of which 5,601 individuals of 235 species were recovered. Oliver L. Austin (Auk 92:626) favorably reviewed McClure's \\"amazingly productive\\" 478-page report, Migration and Survival of the Birds of Asia (U.S. Army component, SEATO, 1974). Lord Medway in his review (Ibis 117: 119‚Äì120) said McClure studied a number of aspects of ornithology in southeast Asia including mixed-species flocks. During his work in Thailand, he took the only known colour photos from a living individual of the now probably extinct white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae, Thai: Nok Ta Phong; from 1968 Nok Chaofa Ying Sirinthon). This (until 1968 as Nok Ta Phong only locally known) bird was officially discovered 1968 and has never been confirmed again after 1978. After retirement, McClure went back to Camarillo, California, teaching non-credit classes at Moorpark and Ventura community colleges, lecturing to various groups, and continuing to band birds. His publications included more than 150 articles and eight books, including Bird Banding (1984) and Whistling Wings (1991). After the death of Lucy on 13 October 1991 he travelled again in 1992 to Thailand to attend the international workshop on Asian hornbills. He travelled to Thailand again in 1993 and visited Japan. He also wrote an autobiography Stories I Like to Tell: An Autobiography (published privately in 1995), which included many photographs of his family and collaborators. His association with the US Army led to his being disallowed into China and the USSR during the cold war years. Handbills were circulated in Tokyo in 1950 describing the work as being on biological warfare. McClure described the rumours that they \\"... were supposed to be inoculating birds with viruses and freeing them to take infection to China and other lands.\\"McClure (1995):283. A species of blood parasite from Zoothera marginata, Leucocytozoon mccluri is named after him. McClure also collected insects from Southeast Asia during the course of the pathology surveys and Telmatoscopus mcclurei, fly from the Batu cave; Aderus mcclurei, a beetle; an erotylid beetle, Triplax mcclurei; and a Milichid fly, Leptometopa mcclurei are named after him.McClure (1995):310-311. McClure became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1942, an elective member in 1973 and a fellow in 1990.

He began his work with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1926 as a propagandist with the editorial department of the magazine \\"Oazo\\" (Huanzhou) and later with \\"Crossroads\\" (Shizi Jietou). Pan became a CCP member in February 1927 and was assigned as managing editor of the \\"Revolutionary Army Daily\\" (Gemingjun Ribao) in Nanchang. Ordered to Shanghai for the entry of the KMT in April, Pan had barely arrived when the 12 April anti-communist coup forced him underground. This may have been the time when Pan was first assigned intelligence duties. Pan escaped Shanghai with Zhou Enlai to Wuhan, but eventually returned to Shanghai to take up a leadership position with their paramount intelligence organization, the CCP Central Committee Special Branch (Zhongyang Teke, CCSB). He became the head of CCSB's Second Section (intelligence) and later the Third Section (Red Squads), in 1931-33 stayed on in Shanghai as the rest of Central Committee was evacuated under intense pressure from KMT intelligence and police in the Shanghai International Settlement and the Shanghai French Concession. Pan eventually left Shanghai in 1933 and participated in the Long March, but returned to Shanghai and regularly visited Hong Kong after the 1935 Zunyi Conference. In 1949 Pan was made a Deputy Mayor of Shanghai. On 3 April 1955 Pan was accused by the PRC Ministry of Public Security of \\"secretly seeking the assistance of the Japanese secret service organs and colluding with the major traitor Wang Jingwei\\". Pan was imprisoned until his death in 1977 but was posthumously rehabilitated. References *David P.

Here R0 is interpreted as the proliferation rate per generation and K = (R0 ‚àí 1) M is the carrying capacity of the environment. The Beverton‚ÄìHolt model was introduced in the context of fisheries by Beverton & Holt (1957). Subsequent work has derived the model under other assumptions such as contest competition (Br√§nnstr√∂m & Sumpter 2005), within-year resource limited competition (Geritz & Kisdi 2004) or even as the outcome of a source-sink Malthusian patches linked by density-dependent dispersal (Bravo de la Parra et al. 2013). The Beverton‚ÄìHolt model can be generalized to include scramble competition (see the Ricker model, the Hassell model and the Maynard Smith‚ÄìSlatkin model). It is also possible to include a parameter reflecting the spatial clustering of individuals (see Br√§nnstr√∂m & Sumpter 2005). Despite being nonlinear, the model can be solved explicitly, since it is in fact an inhomogeneous linear equation in 1/n. The solution is : n_t = \\\\frac{K n_0}{n_0 + (K - n_0) R_0^{-t}}. Because of this structure, the model can be considered as the discrete-time analogue of the continuous-time logistic equation for population growth introduced by Verhulst; for comparison, the logistic equation is : \\\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{N}{K} \\\\right), and its solution is : N(t) = \\\\frac{K N(0)}{N(0) + (K - N(0)) e^{-rt}}.

A failure by him to observe a forward contract agreement that he negotiated with Tan Koon Swan was responsible for the company's collapse in 1985. Tham left Singapore in 1984, before Pan-El collapsed. In April 1986, he was traced to Seattle in the United States by FBI officials. He flew to Tokyo, from where he was extradited back to Singapore, immediately arrested, and charged with 26 counts of helping Tan Kok Liang to make \\"fictitious sharetrading transactions.\\" He was eventually sentenced to a total of 10 years in jail‚Äîeight in 1986 for forging Pan-Electric share certificates and two in 1988 for criminal breach of trust. In February 1991, he was declared a bankrupt for owing S$ 25 million to various parties. Tham was released from jail early, in 1992. He divorced his wife, Joyce Aw, whom he had married in 1973, and married Kok Mei Yee in 1995. In 1998, he was in trouble with the law again after Kok alleged that he had beaten her. She also informed the Official Assignee that although he was still officially bankrupt, he had been keeping a collection of antique longcase clocks and Chinese pottery with a total value of S$400,000 in their Peck Hay Road apartment, without declaring them to the Official Assignee as was required by law. Although his wife later withdrew the private summons charge of assault, he was still being investigated for hiding personal assets and in May 2000, he was charged with hiding about S$ 1.7 million in cash, three cars and other items from the authorities. The trial was adjourned but when the case was next mentioned in September 2000, Tham's lawyer could not contact him and a warrant of arrest was issued for Tham. Tham was later traced to the Indonesian island of Batam, but has since disappeared again. In 2004, his story was re-enacted on an episode of MediaCorp's Missing television series.

Amateur Bayton joined the Stourbridge Cycling Club as a boy where, after a year of club rides, he started racing. Joining the Thornhill Cycling Club in Birmingham he won a handicap race at Hirwaun in South Wales as a 16-year-old junior and a year later was part of the GB Olympic squad under Norman Sheil. After finishing third in third in the Star Trophy Series on 1970 and 1971, he finally won the Star Trophy in 1972 which led to him being selected for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. After being part of an 80-mile breakaway, he initially finished 5th in the road race, ahead of teammate Phil Edwards won the bunch sprint to finish 6th. However, after Spanish rider Jaime Huelamo failed a drug test, he was later moved up to 4th. Professional Struggling to fund his racing career at a time when strict amateur rules prevented any kind of cash prize however small, Bayton found himself having to turn professional, joining Raleigh for the 1973 season with his friend Dave Lloyd. The pair came to the notice of the Italian media with an epic 100 mile breakaway lasting five hours at the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo race which led to an invitation to the Baracchi Trophy two-up time trial. Together they finished third behind Felice Grimondi and Martin Rodriguez in front of 50,000 fans in the Brescia football stadium. Bayton turned down a move to the Belgian-based Watney's squad in 1974, regretting it by the end of season when he left Raleigh to work at the Russell Hobbs factory in the West Midlands with the intention to retire from pro-racing. However his career was saved by Hugh Porter who convinced him to join him at Bantel with whom he finished 3rd in the national road race. In 1982, Bayton finally won the national criterium title at Newport in South Wales, beating Moducel rider Phil Corley in a sprint after the pair had lapped the rest of the field.

Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music (Muze UK Ltd, 1997), p. 128. He is best known for leading his band under the names The Mike Cotton Jazzmen and The Mike Cotton Sound. Cotton currently plays with the Stars of British Jazz. Career Mike Cotton formed The Mike Cotton Jazzmen in the early 1950s during the \\"Trad jazz\\" boom. From 1962 he changed the group's name to The Mike Cotton Sound, and their musical direction to a more pop-based style, achieving a UK chart hit single \\"Swing That Hammer\\" that year. They appeared in a performance in the 1962 film The Wild and the Willing. Member Dave Rowberry left the band in 1965 to join The Animals, and among those who auditioned to take his place were Elton John and Joe Cocker. Ultimately the position went to Steve Gray who went on to play in The Eric Delaney Band and Sky. In 1966 Cotton changed the band's style again to a more soul-based sound and brought in a second vocalist, a former American airman named Bruce McPherson Lucas, known by his surname. He had been working with bands in the Norwich area. The band backed a number of artists in live and studio work at various times during the 1960s, including Sugar Pie DeSanto, Gene Pitney, Stevie Wonder, Doris Troy, The Four Tops and Solomon Burke. When their bass player, Jim Rodford, joined his cousin Rod Argent in his new band Argent in 1969, Cotton changed the band's name to the more modern-sounding Satisfaction, and the band recorded one album under that name in 1970 before splitting up. He retained the brass section, and this line-up, working again under the name Mike Cotton Sound, joined The Kinks, first on their 1971 album Muswell Hillbillies, and then appearing with them both in the studio and in concert until the mid-1970s, after which Cotton returned to playing jazz.

The front of the Auckland Civic Theatre, with its Indian Moghul palace motifs The Akron Civic Theatre entrance lobby and box office An atmospheric theatre is a type of movie palace design which was popular in the late 1920s. Atmospheric theatres were designed and decorated to evoke the feeling of a particular time and place for patrons, through the use of projectors, architectural elements and ornamentation that evoked a sense of being outdoors. This was intended to make the patron a more active participant in the setting.Hoffman, Scott L. A Theatre History of Marion, Ohio: John Eberson's Palace and Beyond. Charlotte, NC: The History Press. 2015. The most successful promoter of the style was John Eberson. He credited the Hoblitzelle Majestic Theatre (Houston, 1923) as the first.Eberson, John. \\"New Theatres for Old.\\" Motion Picture News, December 30, 1927. Before the end of the 1920s he designed around 100 atmospheric theatres in the U.S. and a few other countries, personally selecting the furnishings and art objects. Atmospheric theatres in the United States =Designed by John Eberson= John Eberson was the most successful promoter and designer of the atmospheric style. Sixteen of his atmospheric theatres in the United States are still in operation: *New Regal Theater (originally Avalon Theater) (Chicago) Moorish Revival *Akron Civic Theatre (Akron, Ohio) The theater was built in 1929 by Marcus Loew and designed by theater architect John Eberson. It opened as Loew's (Akron) Theatre and seats 5,000 people. The auditorium is designed to resemble a night in a Moorish garden. Twinkling stars and drifting clouds travel across the domed ceiling. Located on Akron's South Main Street, the theater's entrance lobby extends over the Ohio and Erie Canal. The theater has a small multicolored terra cotta fa√ßade dominated by a large marquee. The interior of the entrance and lobby is designed to resemble a Moorish castle with Mediterranean decor, complete with medieval-style carvings, authentic European antiques and Italian alabaster sculptures. A grand full-sized Wurlitzer organ hidden beneath the stage rises to the stage level on a special elevator.Akron Civic Theatre (official theater website) In June 2001, the Akron Civic Theatre closed its doors for the most expensive and extensive renovation in its history in order to bring the theater up to modern performance and patron standards, and to restoring its failing 75-year-old infrastructure. The renovation cost just over $19 million, which included additional restroom facilities, new concession stands and expansion of the lobbies. The renovation allowed for the Civic to better serve customers with special needs by adding more handicapped seating and a new elevator. To bring the theatre up to new standards the dressing rooms were all redone and the stage was expanded from twenty-six feet to forty feet. Also added to the Civic was a freight elevator, a new loading dock and a cross-over space behind the stage's back wall.\\"Capital Campaign\\" The Civic. Web. n.d. Other improvements included updating the sound system, HVAC, roof exterior, electrical service and modernizing the plumbing. The newly renovated Civic Theatre re-opened in November 2002. *Indiana Theatre (Terre Haute, Indiana) The Indiana Theatre has a Spanish courtyard design and was one of the first Eberson theatres to exhibit atmospheric elements. While not fully atmospheric, the Indiana Theatre's original lighting system gave a blue hue to the auditorium ceiling and scattered light to simulate stars. The tile and terrazzo flooring, shapes of windows, prominence of Spanish coats of arms, Churrigueresque exterior, as well as numerous plaster designs that were seen first in the Indiana Theatre became a framework for later designs. Eberson stated, \\"Into this Indiana Theatre I have put my very best efforts and endeavors in the art of designing a modern theatre such as I have often pictured as what I would do were I given a free hand.\\" *Majestic Theatre (Dallas, Texas) Renaissance Revival. The Majestic Theatre, constructed in 1920, was the first Eberson theatre to use a simulated outdoor sky ceiling. *Majestic Theatre, San Antonio Spanish courtyard *Olympia Theater and Office Building (Miami, FL) Moorish Revival *Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas) Spanish courtyard *Palace Theatre (Canton, Ohio) Spanish courtyard *Palace Theatre (Marion, Ohio) A John Eberson-designed theater, the Palace Theatre (Marion, Ohio) was built in 1928 and renovated in 1976.

The Rialto Cinema originally seated 2,000. The cinema has been converted into a six-theater multiplex. Renovations in 1998 restored its Moorish-themed features and night sky. *Roxy Theatre (Saskatoon, Canada). Built during the onset of the Great Depression. The interior was decorated in a Spanish Villa style with the walls covered with small balconies, windows and towers that gave the impression of quaint Spanish village. The ceiling was painted in an atmospheric-style (dark blue and had twinkling lights set in the plaster) to give the impression of the night sky. *Cineteca Alameda (San Luis Potos√≠ City, Mexico). Located in the city center. The Cineteca Alameda was opened on 27 February 1941 with Marlene Dietrich in \\"Seven Sinners\\". Seating was originally provided for over 1,000 in orchestra and balcony levels. In recent years it was used for concerts, film festivals and for screening classic movies, it seems to have closed in 2012, but had reopened by 2014 offering a mix of art house movies and live performances. It seem only the orchestra seating area is currently being used. *Palacio Chino (Mexico City, Mexico) The fancy Palacio Chino opened on March 29, 1940. It used the shell of a former ball court, whose space was sufficient for a big movie theatre. It was the only one built ever in Mexico in Chinese style, but unlike the Grauman's Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4,000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly big stage, enough so to hold a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable comparison with Grauman's Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of Chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with Chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there. *Campbeltown Picture House (Campbeltown, Scotland) Purpose-built cinema constructed in 1913. It was renovated in 1935 in the atmospheric style. It is the only surviving atmospheric theatre in Scotland.

It was first mentioned in the Veszpr√©m Valley Monastery's Deed of Gift around 970 a. D. According to archaeological findings the place was inhabited since 5000 years. According to the 2001 census, population is about 401 people (2008 estimation is 440). The village is famous about preserving the traditional settlement structure of the Balaton-highlands. Locals make a living from wine and tourism.  Location  Paloznak is located at the northern side of Lake Balaton, the southern flanks of Bakony mountain. The nearby villages are Csopak (from west) and Lovas (from east), the closest city is Balatonf√ºred. It can be reached on the road No. 71.  Flora and climate  The vicinity of Lake Balaton affects the weather heavily, the local microclimate differs from the highlands': the village is sheltered from the wind, the weather is mild all year. The soil is characterized by clayey sand and red marl, along with red sandstone. In the woods one can find oak, beech, and pine, and in the gardens peach, apricot, almond, and ‚Äì first of all ‚Äì grape yield.  History  Archeological research shows that the location has been inhabited since 5000 years. Romans had two villae rusticae. The etymology of Paloznak ('po loznik' means 'at the wineyards' in Slavic language) suggests that the village was populated by Slavic peoples. In 1961, the village became the part of the Als√≥√∂rs-Lovas-Paloznak Common Council, but in 1969 Paloznak formed a new Common Council with Csopak. In 1990 the locals formed an independent municipality. In the 1990s the village experienced a lot of developments, new buildings were built, old ones rebuilt while the village maintained and preserved its original style and structure, which was acknowledged by the Hild J√°nos Award in 1998. The population of the village is growing, people from nearby cities and even from Budapest choose Paloznak as their new home. The attractiveness of the village is lying in its tranquillity, charm and friendliness of the locals.

R√©vf√ºl√∂p is well known as the starting point for an annual long-distance swimming race across the Balaton to Balatonbogl√°r. Etymology F√ºl√∂p comes from the Hungarian version of the personal name Phillip; this was the original name of the town. Later, the word r√©v, which means ferry crossing, was added as a prefix. History R√©vf√ºl√∂p has existed since Medieval times, when it developed as a r√©v, or ferry crossing point, due to the proximity to the southern shore. The settlement is first mentioned in 1211. Around 1538, it was destroyed during the Turkish invasion. Subsequently, it became a viticultural colony of the nearby town K≈ëv√°g√≥√∂rs, and then a vassal land of the Tihany Abbey. However, by the early 18th century, private owners began buying property in the area once more. In 1752, the harbor reopened, and during the 19th century, the town expanded due to the construction projects of many wealthy vacationers, under whose alliance in the R√©vf√ºl√∂p Beach and Shore Development Committee the town gained independence in 1943. Since this time, R√©vf√ºl√∂p has been characterized by dynamic growth. Further increases in boat and train traffic ‚Äî R√©vf√ºl√∂p sports a large railway station ‚Äî have made the town a local commercial and professional center, with numerous specialty stores, restaurants, and hotels opening over the course of the 20th century as the number of vacationers increased. It was also during this time that the town was connected to the national telephone and electrical infrastructure. Today, viticulture and the tourist-service sector are the two primary sources of employment. In 2001, the Millennium Lookout Tower was constructed on the mountain north of the town. The main historical attraction remains the old downtown and port, both featuring eclectic architecture evocative of the turn of the 20th century.

History  Archaeological findings show that Vaszar was already populated in the Bronze Age. Its earliest documented mention is from 1332. Everyday objects, ranging from prehistoric to the Late Middle Ages, have been found on its territory. During the Middle Ages it was the centre of the Gy≈ër bishopric's Veszpr√©m estates. From 1403 it belonged to the Bakonyb√©l Abbey for a while. From 1567‚Äî1592 it was under Turkish rule, during which time it was abandoned. Later, in the 18th century, it was repopulated. Situated 8 kilometres North-northeast of P√°pa, Vaszar is an ancient settlement. Archaeological studies between their borders in the 1930s and 1960s show that the area has been inhabited since ancient times. Artefacts from the Bronze Age, the early Iron Age, the Avar period and the Hungarian conquest show that the area was liked and well suitable for establishing living conditions. Forest and swampy lakes surrounded the ridgeline, on which the village was built. In 1910, 2125 of the 2126 inhabitants were ethnic Hungarians, of which 2055 were Roman Catholic and 56 were Evangelical.

Completed in July 2008 by Mighty River Power at a cost of NZ$300 million, the plant's capacity proved greater than expected. The station is the largest single generator geothermal plant in New Zealand.  Energy production  The Kawerau geothermal power station boosted the country's geothermal capacity by 25 percent and significantly increased local generation capacity in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. The plant meets approximately one third of residential and industrial demand in the region and provides cost certainty to local industry including Norske Skog Tasman. The station uses a single Fuji turbine and steam from geothermal bores. The two phase fluid is flashed/separated twice to produce high and low pressure steam to feed the turbine. The Kawerau field also supplies process steam to the Kawerau pulp and paper mill. This is used for process and power generation. Two small binary power plants use waste hot geothermal water for power generation. Kawerau is the world's premiere geothermal field. A binary plant is also located west of the main power station.

History The wool trade had been important in Bristol since the 11th century, but the smell generated by fullers softening wool in urine meant the trade was banished from the city centre and relocated in Redcliffe. The building was constructed in 1830 to house the city's wool market, as Bristol Bridge had become too congested by sheep farmers travelling across it. It was designed by Richard Shackleton Pope and has been described as 'the first quasi-industrial building in Bristol to attempt a real architectural facade'. It was designed in the classical style with a symmetrical front. Internally, the building included a Pennant-flagged ground floor and staircase. The ground floor served as a weighing house, while the upper floors were used for storage. The total cost was ¬£4,400 (now ¬£). The building was not a success since it was too far from the farmer's markets at Temple Meads, and the wool trade moved to the Corn Exchange in 1834. The building survived the bombing of Bristol during World War II, unlike several nearby 17th-century buildings which were hit and subsequently demolished. In 1980, the building was modified to include new doors. The ground floor became the appropriately named Fleece and Firkin brewpub, while the upper floors were offices. The Fleece has become a popular small live music venue in Bristol, hosting gigs by Oasis, Pulp, Emeli Sande, Radiohead and Amy Winehouse. The Wool Hall was awarded grade II listed building status by English Heritage in 1975.

It was initially published in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. Date and performance The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 14 May 1622. It was acted by the King's Men; the cast included John Lowin, Joseph Taylor, Robert Benfield, Nicholas Tooley, John Shank, George Birch, Richard Sharpe, and Thomas Holcombe. Authorship Due to Fletcher's distinctive stylistic profile, the division of authorship in the play is largely clear and unambiguous. Cyrus Hoy gave this breakdown of the two writers' relative shares:Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; pp. 76, 108. :Fletcher ‚Äî Act I; Act III, Act V, scene 3; :Massinger ‚Äî Act II; Act IV; Act V, scenes 1 and 2. E. H. C. Oliphant provided the same scheme, except for an assignment of V,2 to Fletcher.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; p. 245. Massinger may have revised the original play in 1629, for a revival in July of that year. One source of the play's plot is the History of Carinus of Flavius Vopiscus.Logan and Smith, p. 76. (Massinger had previously dealt with the reign of Diocletian in The Virgin Martyr, his collaboration with Dekker.) Adaptation The Prophetess was revived by Thomas Betterton in 1690, in a musical adaptation \\"After the Manner of an Opera,\\" with music by Henry Purcell;Arthur Colby Sprague, Beaumont and Fletcher on the Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1926; pp. 154‚Äì60. that version is sometimes known by the title Dioclesian. Betterton and Purcell's adaptation was performed in Dublin late in 1735. Critical response The Prophetess has been called \\"a strange and difficult play,\\" noteworthy as almost the only work in Fletcher's canon that treats magic and thaumaturgy as a serious element, with Delphia \\"as a kind of a curiously feminized Prospero.\\"Gordon McMullan, The Politics of Unease in the Plays of John Fletcher. Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1994; pp. 183 and ff. Synopsis In the 1647 folio, The Prophetess is called a \\"Tragical History.\\" At one point in the drama, the Chorus states that the play provides \\"Historie, / yet mixt...with sweet varietie\\" (IV,i). The plot certainly does offer historical information (some fairly accurate, some wildly not), intermingled with borrowings from folklore, legend, and fairy tale. The story begins in 284 A.D., with the reputedly historical murder of Numerian (the play calls him Numerianus) by Lucius Flavius Aper (in the play, Volutius Aper). In the opening scene, the emperor Charinus and his sister Aurelia discuss their brother's reported murder. They decide to offer a munificent reward to the man who kills Aper ‚Äî co-rulership of the Roman Empire and Aurelia's hand in marriage. (This is a classic fairy-tale element ‚Äî \\"half my kingdom and the hand of my daughter\\" ‚Äî and wholly ahistorical). At this point, Diocles is a common soldier, who is spending his best efforts killing wild boars; the witch/sorceress Delphia has prophesied that Diocles will become emperor when his kills a certain boar. The prophecy comes with a condition: Diocles will also marry Delphia's niece Drusilla, who is deeply in love with him. When Diocles complains that he still is not emperor despite all the boars he's killed, Delphia merely tells him that he hasn't yet got the right one. Then Diocles learns of the bounty placed on Aper's head, and gets the point of the prophecy: aper is the Latin term for a wild boar. Diocles kills Aper, and receives his reward: upon ascending to the highest place in the empire, he amends his name to Dioclesianus. But he has conveniently forgotten about Drusilla, and plans to marry Aurelia. Delphia doesn't like this. She reproves his faithlessness, but Dioclesian is recalcitrant; in the early scenes of the play he acts with the egomania and bombast of Marlowe's Tamburlaine. Delphia's magic is so powerful, however, that she can spoil the hero's good fortune. A sudden storm of thunder and lightning, caused by Delphia, forces the superstitious Romans to delay the wedding; then Delphia's spells make Aurelia fall in love with Dioclesian's nephew Maximinian. (Maximinian is based on the historical Maximian, Diocletian's co-ruler but no familial relation.) Dioclesian rages at Delphia's interference, but events forestall any action on his part. In their long-running conflict with the Persians, the Romans have captured the Persian princess Cassana, sister of the king, Cosroe. (The historical Khosrau I ruled nearly three centuries after the historical period of the play, 531‚Äì579 A.D.; his presence here constitutes the drama's biggest departure from historical fact. \\"Cosroe\\" is a stereotypical Persian emperor of much Western literature; he appears in Tamburlaine and in other plays and operas.) Aurelia uses the captured princess as her servant. Persian ambassadors try to ransom Cassana, but the proud Aurelia dismisses even the highest offers. Desperate, the Persian ambassadors manage (with Delphia's magic help) to abduct Charinus, Aurelia, and Maximinian and take them into Persian custody. Dioclesian rushes with his army to rescue them; by this time, though, he has learned to moderate his egotism and ambition. He is victorious over the Persians on the battlefield, yet with uncharacteristic magnanimity he pardons and releases Cosroe and Cassana, and then surprises all by abdicating his position in favor of his nephew Maximinian. Dioclesian marries Drusilla and retires to a farm in Lombardy. Maximinian is now co-ruler with Charinus, but the two come into conflict. Maximinian believes that his own rule will never be secure as long as Dioclesian lives: the soldiers admire the abdicated uncle more than the nephew in power. In the play's climax, Maximinian leads his troops against Dioclesian; but an apparent divine intervention (Delphia-inspired) ‚Äî earthquake, thunder, lightning, and a godly hand in the clouds ‚Äî turns Maximinian repentant. Dioclesian and Drusilla are left to enjoy their country retirement, unmolested. The play's comic relief is supplied by the clown character Geta, a servant and follower of Dioclesian who is promoted to an officer, without any of the qualities that would qualify him for the position. The play's departures from historical fact are almost too many to list. The actual Maximian was Diocletian's co-ruler, not his heir; Carinus died in 285, before Maximian was elevated to Caesarship; Maximian retired at the same time as Diocletian; when he became emperor, Diocletian was not a common soldier but a consul; Diocletian retired to Dalmatia, not Lombardy; etc. etc. The play contains surprisingly old-fashioned features for a work of the 1620s; its chorus, dumbshow, and Marlovain bombast suggest a work of the previous generation of dramas. It is possible that The Prophetess is a reworking of the lost play Diocletian from 1594. The play contains spectacular elements; critics have wondered exactly how the entrance of Delphia and Drusilla in II,iii, \\"in a Throne drawn by Dragons,\\" could have been staged.

Aerialphotography: Szentb√©kk√°lla, monastery ruins Interesting geology at Szentb√©kk√°lla The Szentb√©kk√°lla region is interesting from geological aspects. The volcanism at the Bakony‚ÄìBalaton Highland Volcanic Field produced beautiful scenic mountains which preserved the elevations of the Pliocene plains. The basalts contain various xenoliths. Among the xenoliths there are igneous inclusions genetically related to basalts. Genetic and textural characteristics of the host basalt and some of its inclusions are analog from Szentb√©kk√°lla, North-Balaton Mountains, Hungary, to the range of the Martian meteorites, the shergottites. Several types of periodic rocks (lherzolites, websterites and harzburgites) can be found as inclusions in the basalt of tuff and the olivine-phyric basalts also can be found among the basalts of the Little Hungarian Plain and Tapolca Basin. Short origin history of lherzolites of Szentb√©kk√°lla It was found 150 years ago, that basalts of the Balaton-Highlands contain \\"olivine-bombs\\". Later, about 40 years ago it was shown, that these olivine-bombs are xenoliths originating in the upper mantle. All four main components of the lehrolites were found: the two fpyroxenes, olivine and spinel. Petrographic research all over the world studied mantle xenoliths and it was found, they are the source rocks for basalts: the basalts are partial melts of the mantle rocks. During the upheaval process the basaltic liquid carries up the fragments of the upper mantle. Several other igneous xenoliths are also related to the upper mantle and basalts.

The Eiksund Tunnel is an undersea rock tunnel created by drilling and blasting, with 1,300 tonnes of explosive used. 660,000 cubic metres of rock were removed during construction. Usage The tunnel carries two lanes on the √òrsta-side, and two lanes + one crawling lane on the Eiksund- side. Prior to construction the average daily traffic through the Eiksund Tunnel was projected to be 1,000 vehicles per day (vpd). The ease of crossing the fjord, however, rapidly increased traffic to 2200 vpd. When the tunnel was fully financed after six years and became toll free, traffic jumped again to 2880 vpd. =Incidents= On 28 June 2009, there was a severe accident in the tunnel, leaving five men dead.

Like a typical suburban mall at the time, it had an Eng Wah cinema, a Timezone arcade (the largest in Singapore as of that point), a food court, a John Little department store, a Courts store, a Popular bookstore, the local post office, an NTUC FairPrice supermarket and more than 60 specialty stores. In 1999, due to declining patronage, the cinema and arcade were closed and were replaced by retail outlets and the Pasir Ris Public Library respectively. The mall was sold to ARMF Pte Ltd in 2004. The mall did not undergo any major renovations until 2007, when more stores were opened and its facade was repainted blue. John Little was replaced by several smaller stores, and the food court was relocated to the 3rd floor, taking up the space initially occupied by Courts. The entire carpark at Basement 1 was converted to retail space and travelators were installed to link it to Basement 2 and 3 carparks. The mall went through another round of renovations in 2014 and reopened in May 2016, with a new tenant mix, a new interior layout and an enhanced blue facade. The library was revamped, the local post office was relocated to level 5, and the bookstore relocated to level 4. Currently, its main tenants are McDonald's, NTUC FairPrice, Pasir Ris Public Library and Cookhouse by Koufu.

Football career  Hall was born in Newark, Nottinghamshire, and played for Notts County from 1930 before joining Tottenham for a fee of ¬£2,600 in 1932. He was a versatile inside forward and skillful dribbler. In his later career he played at full-back. He made his international debut against France in December 1933 and went on to appear in a total of ten international games for England. During England's match against Northern Ireland on 16 November 1938, Hall scored five goals during a 30-minute period either side of half-time. Three of these were within a four- minute spell and Hall still holds the record for the fastest hat-trick in international matches. During the Second World War, Hall continue to play in friendly matches for Spurs whilst also being a member of the London Police Reserve. Later career Ill-health brought an end to his playing career in 1945 and he suffered the amputation of both lower legs. He continued his association with the game as a vice-president of the Spurs Supporters Club and in coaching roles at Clapton Orient and other clubs. Testimonial games were played at both Tottenham and Notts County grounds in 1946. From 1954 he became a publican. The Willie Hall Memorial Trophy is still played for each year having been inaugurated in 1967, the year he died, by the Newark Football Alliance. Hall's fame was enhanced on 16 February 1959, when he was chosen as the subject of This Is Your Life by BBC Television host Eamonn Andrews. But, no longer a man of such stamina, Hall spent more time with his sister back in Newark, fishing, and nostalgic sharing with old friends. Here, having watched Tottenham beat Chelsea 2‚Äì1 in the FA Cup on 20 May, Hall died of a heart attack on 22 May 1967. His thanksgiving service took place on 30 May at St Mary Magdalene Church, followed by cremation, and the ashes were later interred at Newark Cemetery. Tribute has been paid locally to a man of great bravery and talent, not just in the N.A.L.H.S. plaque, but also in the Willie Hall Cup, presented annually to the winners of the Newark Sunday Alliance. 2006 brought his installation within the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame References  External links  * Hall's profile on englandstats.com * England Records - England F.C.

Crimean War graves Grave of British soldiers who died in Crimean War The cemetery was first established for British soldiers from the Crimean War, who died mostly as the result of a cholera epidemic in the first organized military hospital in modern history created by Florence Nightingale. Around 6,000 soldiers died during the war in the Selimiye Barracks (aka Scutari Barracks) in Istanbul, which was converted into a military hospital. The graves of the dead, of which only a few are marked today, were placed at two separate plots on a hillside close to the Sea of Marmara next to the military hospital. The land, formerly owned by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1495‚Äì1566),Understanding Gallipoli was donated to the British Government in 1855. The two plots were linked in 1867 by a second land grant. An obelisk was erected in 1857 by Queen Victoria (1819‚Äì1901) within the cemetery to commemorate the British soldiers from the Crimean War. A bronze plaque, attached by the British community in Turkey on the plinth of the Crimean Memorial and unveiled on Empire Day, 1954, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Florence Nightingale‚Äôs nursing service in this region, bears the inscription: > \\"To Florence Nightingale, whose work near this Cemetery a century ago > relieved much human suffering and laid the foundations for the nursing > profession.\\" Other monuments in the cemetery include a symbolic broken column in memorial of German J√§ger officers who fell in the Crimea, and a British memorial, which was erected in 1855 initially in the Therapia Crimean Cemetery (today Tarabya in the European part of Istanbul), and later transferred here together with the graves of 18 personnel of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who died in the sultan‚Äôs mansion in Therapia, which had been converted into a military hospital.Understanding Gallipoli, Section 2 Civilian burials Since 1867, more than 700 civilians are interred in a separate section within the cemetery.

Two other memorials of World War I are found in the cemetery, one bearing the names of a little over 200 soldiers of United Kingdom and Undivided India, who fell in various parts of Russia or on the borders of Turkey, and whose burial grounds could not be maintained. The other memorial is dedicated to the servicemen of the Indian Army who died between 1919 and 1920 in the prisoner-of-war camps in southern Turkey near Adana and were interred in the Maslak and Osmaniye Indian Cemeteries. In 1961, when those cemeteries could not be further maintained, the earth with the ashes of the cremated remains of these men was transferred here and scattered near the monument, and the remains of their Muslim comrades were re-interred.

In the north, central and east of the country tribes of Bantu peoples occupied land on a communal basis under tribal chiefdoms. It was an overwhelmingly pastoral economy and wealth was measured in the number of cattle men held. Population growth had created a land pressure that had seen the tribes move steadily from the origins in central east Africa. In the southern and western parts of the country, San (Bushmen) peoples led nomadic lives based on hunting and the Khoikhoi (Hottentots) peoples led a pastoral existence. In the first half of the 20th century, agriculture and mining were the largest parts of the South African economy.  Early history  The first evidence of pottery and agriculture (sheep) in South Africa can be found in the period of 350-150 BCE, while metals date back to the 52-252 CE period. The earliest occurrence of cattle farming was in the 5th century CE and the Iron Age reached modern-day Kwa-Zulu Natal around 700 CE. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe (c.11th - 13th century CE) was a medieval state in South Africa located at the confluence of the Shashe and Limpopo rivers. This saw the beginnings of South Africa's gold and ivory trade and the production of jewelry and art. The Golden Rhinoceros of Mapungubwe was discovered on a royal grave at the site of Mapungubwe Hill, and was on display at the British Museum as part of an exhibition celebrating the art of South Africa. Mapungubwe also saw the first development of stonemasonry in what is now South Africa. Glass beads and Chinese ceramics were imported.

Groot Constantia, the oldest wine estate in South Africa. The South African wine industry (New World wine) is among the lasting legacy of the VOC era.Estreicher, Stefan K.

Fourie, Johan; von Fintel, Dieter (2014), 'Settler Skills and Colonial Development: The Huguenot Wine-Makers in Eighteenth-Century Dutch South Africa,'. The Economic History Review 67(4): 932‚Äì963. Like native economy of Taiwan in pre-VOC era, pre-1652 South Africa was virtually undeveloped or was in almost primitive state. The recorded economic history of South Africa began with the VOC period. In 1652 a permanent European settlement was established in Cape Town in the far south west of the country. It was not originally planned as a colony but as a refreshment station. Malnutrition, especially scurvy, a vitamin C deficiency arising from a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables, was a problem for the ships of the Dutch East India Company that were plying trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, modern Indonesia. To deal with the problems, the Company established a garden at the foot of Table Mountain and bartered cattle from the Khoikhoi to supply to passing ships. However, the arrival of permanent European settlers triggered profound change. The Europeans intentionally decimated the San through disease , driving them to the Kalahari Desert region and virtually destroyed the Khoikhoi people as a struggle against European colonialism. The Khoikhoi( Quena) were enslaved and their identity destroyed for the furtherance of European colonialism. Land hunger led to wars between the Bantu as the settlers migrated eastwards from the original settlement in Cape Town . Between the wars , commerce developed between the settlers and the indigenous peoples. Sales of produce and stock saw the development of a black, landed peasantry. . Immigrant skills The Europeans meanwhile imported slaves from Malaya as artisans. Their skills have contributed to the clothing being a major industry in the Cape today. There were other waves of migration from Europe. Persecuted Huguenots from France turned their hands to wine production and Germans and British grew the nascent industrial base and developed modern farming methods. Contrary to popular belief, slaves did not heavily work the farms of the Cape, as that was done contractually by the Khoi, but mostly by the Dutch settlers. Slaves were also imported to the South African region for work on the large scale wine plantations founded by European settlers. Altogether these ambitious efforts increased living standards of the white population substantially. The province of Natal, a British colony, was found suitable for sugar production but the local Zulu tribes could not be attracted as cane cutters as they lacked the skill and competency to work. Indentured labour was brought from India. The descendants of these labourers play an active role in commerce and industry today. Additional to slavery, there was another form of coerced labor supply: The Zulu and other kingdoms used young men for coerced labor both as warriors and pastorals. The European migrants diverged: the Continental Europeans merged to speak a Dutch-derived language, Afrikaans, and the English continued to speak English which became the language of commerce. This dichotomy was also seen in the economy, as farmers were mainly Afrikaans-speaking while English-speaking South Africans were drawn to commerce and industry. Boer republics The Afrikaners formed two independent inland republics, the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR) and the Oranje Vrystaat (Orange Free State). On the coast the British occupied the Cape Colony and Natal. The discovery of diamonds in the Cape Province in 1866 the discovery of gold twenty years later on the Witwatersrand in the ZAR transformed the economy and attracted considerable foreign interest. The subsequent diamond and gold rushes saw further migrations of a range of nationalities including Cornish miners and eastern European Jews amongst others. The British invaded the Freestate and ZAR and brought them under British control uniting the four provinces in the Union of South Africa in 1910. But perhaps the greatest impact was the influx of international capital to finance the mining operations, including the arrival of Cecil John Rhodes who formed the De Beers and Anglo-American. During the age of African colonization, due to its large amount of gold and diamond mines, South Africa attracted the majority (55,8%) of overseas investments to the whole African continent. Migrant labour The indigenous people had no knowledge about the mining economy and this led to a shortage of labour on the mines. In a measure to force labour to the mines, Rhodes, who had turned from forming the De Beers Company to politics, secured the passing of the Glen Grey Act in 1894. The Act obliged the payment of tax with the specific aim of forcing peasant farmers, who were not part of the money economy, to find work that paid money to pay the taxes. The Act was a deliberate move by Rhodes to force labour to the mines. This was the start of a migratory labour system in which black men travelled to the mines to work leaving their families in the tribal areas. The supply of labour became more than sufficient and the mining companies formed a buying cartel through their association, the Chamber of Mines. This enabled them to create a monopsony (market conditions where there is only one buyer) that suppressed wages. The mines also attracted labour from neighbouring countries such as Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe), Nyasaland (now Malawi) and Mozambique (that was then a Portuguese colony) that kept wages of black workers down. Rand Rebellion South African gold mines are deep and expensive to run and the mine companies endeavoured to keep costs down. However, in trying to train blacks for skilled jobs, they ran into conflict with white miners. The racist white miners resisted black miners in 1922 in the area around the centre of gold mining: the Witwatersrand. The Rand Rebellion was crushed with what was an early use of air power and some white miners were dispatched to the gallows. Those sentenced to hang were said to have gone to the gallows quoting Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels's Communist Manifesto, saying, \\"Workers of the world unite\\". Poor Whites Among the white population there were many Afrikaner sharecroppers (tenant farmers who shared their crops with their landlord in lieu of rent). However, the onset of the Great Depression, combined with drought, led to the forced sale and consolidation of many of these farms, which itself led to the eviction of the residential sharecroppers. These subsequently unemployed whites flooded towns, competing with blacks for jobs in the mines. Special attention was paid to this new influx of white poverty (as opposed to any changes in non-whites' statuses), and the Carnegie Corporation, founded by Scots-born, American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, conducted a study into white poverty that was published as the Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa in 1932. It led to the alleviation of white poverty, but to some it was also seen as the foundation for the formalised system of racial discrimination against blacks that became known as apartheid. Blacks had no vote and the whites used their political power to force the mining companies to protect skilled jobs for whites. Labour- Afrikaner Nationalist Unity From the late 1920s, whites elected governments that united white labour and Afrikaner Nationalism that used sanctions such as denying government contracts, against businesses that did not employ people who spoke Afrikaans. Nationalised industries were established, like steel and the railways, which reserved even low skilled jobs for whites. The 1930s and 1940s saw the rapid industrialisation of the country as it supplied the mining industry and the government invested in major projects to protect white employment. South Africa not only had gold and diamonds but vast quantities of iron, coal and many other minerals. Agriculture diminished in importance as mining and then industry grew. While English-speaking South Africans dominated industrial and commercial life Afrikaners banded together in mutual financial organisations that in due course were to be become major players in that sector of the economy. Apartheid In 1948, a government was elected that introduced the policy of apartheid (segregation) that was aimed to allow different racial groups to progress in their own separate areas. In the two decades following the rise to power of the National Party, whites (particularly Afrikaners) rose above all other ethnic groups in South Africa through their dominant and tactful performance in the labour market. Throughout the 1960s, South Africa had economic dominance over the rest of Africa and was considered the only developed country in Africa by the United Nations economic criteria. Throughout this period South Africa produced twice as much electricity and six times as much steel as the rest of the African continent combined while at the same time, accounting for 43% of Africa's entire mineral production output. Economic dominance during this period was made possible by Black South Africans and migratory labour from Malawi, Lesotho and Portuguese Mozambique who all experienced poor working conditions and relativity low wages. The government at the time even admitted that Black labour was crucial to their economic success and hence talks of territorial and political separation along racial lines at the time was deemed a threat to economic expansion for South Africa. As noted by one historian, \\"Full employment, in combination with labour controls, limitations on the free movement and employment of non-whites, and the use of colour bars at company level, contributed to high levels of disposable income for the white population\\".Contemporary South Africa by Anthony Butler Many English-speaking South Africans had participated in the heavy discrimination that preceded apartheid, and tacitly supported the legislation while paying lip service to opposing the laws. By so doing apartheid managed to create a system in which black people were pushed to the margins of their land through the imposition of the Land Act of 1913. In result; many blacks are unskilled, illiterate, and have low living standards. Their schooling system, the Bantu languages education, was based on the notion that black people cannot progress fast enough in scientific subjects due to lower intellectual skills, and has resulted in many being excluded from work requiring skill. Business support for apartheid With the support of foreign capital, the mines and the mining finance houses, largely dominated by English-speaking South Africans, prospered under the system of apartheid and shunned outright opposition. In return for the continued monopsony of labour purchase for the mines that kept wages low and outlawed trade unions, the English-speaking mining companies tolerated job reservation that prevented blacks from developing skills. This is debated, however, as policies to restrict labour supply to whites only resulted in higher miner wages than under a system of equal employment. Over time the mining companies introduced changes to lower their costs but the alliance with the government continued. White trade unionism was allowed but there were no black trade unions until the 1970s. Sanctions The imposition of international sanctions on the country began economic pressure that saw the unravelling of apartheid. There were oil sanctions but South Africa continued to be able to buy oil on international markets and developed technology that allowed the conversion of coal into oil. A small gas field was discovered off the coast of the Cape. But the most damaging isolation was the denial of investment funds and the boycott of South African investments particularly by influential universities and foundations in the United States. These boycotts limited the capital available to South African businesses. Ironically, during the 1980s gold reached its highest price as a result of international tensions reaping huge profits for the mining company conglomerates. However, because of currency restrictions and bans on the sales of Krugerrands in some countries, they were unable to invest abroad. The result was that they used their surplus funds to buy up businesses in virtually every activity in the economy. However, the financial benefit for the mining companies of continuing to support the system eroded as international capital stopped flowing into the country. Unsustainable burden of sanctions  In 1990 the president Frederik Willem (F.W.) de Klerk recognised the economic unsustainability of the burden of international sanctions and released Nelson Mandela the nationalist leader and unbanned the African National Congress (ANC) that Mandela led. Despite some fears that the country could become unmanageable because of tribal conflict or even a military take over by the white-dominated armed forces de Klerk and Mandela guided the country to democratic elections in 1994 with Mandela as president. Despite socialist rhetoric and support from socialist countries in its early years the ANC maintained the mixed economy and encouraged the market economy including relaxing foreign exchange controls. In January 1991, SACP general secretary Joe Slovo, DP Finance Spokesman Harry Schwarz and Deputy Finance Minister Org Marais, debated the state's role in a post-apartheid economy, in an historic debate organised by the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa. Black empowerment  At the same time they embarked on the Reconstruction and Development Plan to improve services including housing, education and health to blacks only as a means to achieve much needed equity. The ANC also initiated a system of \\"black economic empowerment\\" which its aim was to establish equity to the previously disadvantaged races and the race that was advantaged. Land hunger again A major source of stress remains the redistribution of land. Under apartheid 73% of land was in so called \\"white areas\\" and many blacks had been uprooted and removed to previous tribal areas to keep crime and vandalism away from important land. The slow legal and bureaucratic process of restitution is causing impatience among blacks and concern among white farmers that South Africa may go down the route of neighbouring Zimbabwe where land is being unilaterally seized by the government and its supporters, causing food shortages as the new owners tend to have less farming experience. First- world infrastructure The needs of the mines to maintain internal security under apartheid had seen parts of South Africa develop an infrastructure that was sufficient to cater to business in the cities and as a connection between provinces (states). This has served the country well in the post apartheid years but is going to waste as infrastructure has not been well maintained by the ruling government. Foreign investment has flowed from South Africa around the globe: several major companies including Anglo-American, Old Mutual and South African Breweries are now listed on the London Stock Exchange.

This is a special case of the graph theoretical notion of a path. A self- avoiding polygon (SAP) is a closed self-avoiding walk on a lattice. Very little is known rigorously about the self-avoiding walk from a mathematical perspective, although physicists have provided numerous conjectures that are believed to be true and are strongly supported by numerical simulations. In computational physics, a self-avoiding walk is a chain-like path in or with a certain number of nodes, typically a fixed step length and has the property that it doesn't cross itself or another walk. A system of SAWs satisfies the so-called excluded volume condition. In higher dimensions, the SAW is believed to behave much like the ordinary random walk. SAWs and SAPs play a central role in the modeling of the topological and knot-theoretic behavior of thread- and loop-like molecules such as proteins. Indeed, SAWs may have first been introduced by the chemist Paul Flory in order to model the real-life behavior of chain-like entities such as solvents and polymers, whose physical volume prohibits multiple occupation of the same spatial point. SAWs are fractals. For example, in the fractal dimension is 4/3, for it is close to 5/3 while for the fractal dimension is . The dimension is called the upper critical dimension above which excluded volume is negligible. A SAW that does not satisfy the excluded volume condition was recently studied to model explicit surface geometry resulting from expansion of a SAW. The properties of SAWs cannot be calculated analytically, so numerical simulations are employed. The pivot algorithm is a common method for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations for the uniform measure on -step self-avoiding walks. The pivot algorithm works by taking a self-avoiding walk and randomly choosing a point on this walk, and then applying symmetrical transformations (rotations and reflections) on the walk after the th step to create a new walk. Calculating the number of self-avoiding walks in any given lattice is a common computational problem. There is currently no known formula, although there are rigorous methods of approximation. For self-avoiding walks from one end of a diagonal to the other, with only moves in the positive direction, there are exactly :{m+n \\\\choose m,n} paths for an rectangular lattice. Universality One of the phenomena associated with self-avoiding walks and statistical physics models in general is the notion of universality, that is, independence of macroscopic observables from microscopic details, such as the choice of the lattice. One important quantity that appears in conjectures for universal laws is the connective constant, defined as follows. Let denote the number of -step self-avoiding walks. Since every -step self avoiding walk can be decomposed into an -step self-avoiding walk and an -step self-avoiding walk, it follows that . Therefore, the sequence is subadditive and we can apply Fekete's lemma to show that the following limit exists: :\\\\mu = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} c_n^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}. is called the connective constant, since depends on the particular lattice chosen for the walk so does . The exact value of is only known for the hexagonal lattice, where it is equal to: :\\\\sqrt{2 + \\\\sqrt{2}}. For other lattices, has only been approximated numerically, and is believed not to even be an algebraic number. It is conjectured that :c_n \\\\approx \\\\mu^n n^{\\\\frac{11}{32}} as , where depends on the lattice, but the power law correction n^{\\\\frac{11}{32}} does not; in other words, this law is believed to be universal. On networks Self-avoiding walks have also been studied in the context of network theory. In this context, it is customary to treat the SAW as a dynamical process, such that in every time-step a walker randomly hops between neighboring nodes of the network. The walk ends when the walker reaches a dead-end state, such that it can no longer progress to newly un- visited nodes. It was recently found that on Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi networks, the distribution of path lengths of such dynamically grown SAWs can be calculated analytically, and follows the Gompertz distribution. Limits Consider the uniform measure on -step self-avoiding walks in the full plane. It is currently unknown whether the limit of the uniform measure as induces a measure on infinite full-plane walks. However, Harry Kesten has shown that such a measure exists for self-avoiding walks in the half-plane. One important question involving self-avoiding walks is the existence and conformal invariance of the scaling limit, that is, the limit as the length of the walk goes to infinity and the mesh of the lattice goes to zero. The scaling limit of the self-avoiding walk is conjectured to be described by Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution with parameter  See also  * Critical phenomena * Universality (dynamical systems) * Random walk References Further reading # # # #  External links  *  the number of self-avoiding paths joining opposite corners of an N √ó N grid, for N from 0 to 12.

John Smith (1781 ‚Äì 22 July 1852) was a Scottish architect. His career started in 1805 and he was appointed as the official city architect of Aberdeen in 1807, the first person to hold this post. Together with Archibald Simpson, he contributed significantly to the architecture of Aberdeen, and many of the granite buildings that gave the city the nickname 'The Granite City' or also 'The Silver City' are attributed to them. Smith was the son of a successful builder and architect and his own son, William, continued the family tradition by also becoming an architect. After completing his training in London, Smith quickly became established throughout the north-east of Scotland. He secured private commissions to design, renovate or alter numerous country houses, parish churches and castles; his official capacity as City Architect ensured he is also credited with several extensive public works. Towards the middle of his career around the 1830s, as his individuality developed, he gained the nickname of 'Tudor Johnny'; an indication his designs were starting to favour a Tudor Gothic styling. Ancestry and early life Smith was born in Aberdeen in 1781. His father was William 'Sink-em' Smith (d. 1815), also a successful builder and architect. The younger Smith attended Aberdeen Grammar School before serving an apprenticeship as a stonemason in his father's building firm. He undertook further architectural design training in London, possibly under the tutelage of James Playfair, but as Playfair died in 1794, the offices of Robert Lugar seem more likely. By the end of 1804, Smith returned to Aberdeen, where construction and development was rapidly evolving. Career 33 King Street, now Aberdeen Arts Centre, formerly the North Church The grave of John Smith, architect, Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen One of Smith's first major commissions was to design a town house for the merchant Patrick Milne in 1805. Sited on Union Street, Aberdeen, Crimonmogate was a two-storey \\"Greek inspired country house\\" with a five windowed frontage. He is next credited with the design of Footdee, an area within Aberdeen. Consisting of 56 but and ben one storey thatched houses arranged in two squares, the plans quickly received Council approval and construction was completed by 1809. The new housing accommodated residents formerly living in condemned properties beside the harbour; the re-location of these tenants allowed the Council to begin initial proceedings for Thomas Telford's 1824 Aberdeen Harbour improvements, which Smith was also associated with. Smith was appointed as the official architect for Aberdeen in 1807. He is credited with compiling the first map showing a correct outline of Aberdeen city in 1810 indicating present and planned improvements. Archibald Simpson returned to Aberdeen in 1813, establishing a business competing with Smith. Both firms were successful despite uncertainties due to the War and their careers were described by Miller as \\"destined to run remarkably parallel\\". Although at times rivals, Smith often collaborated with Simpson and between these two men their buildings became the nucleus of establishing the style of the heart of the Aberdeen city centre. As the buildings were constructed from silver granite, the city gained the name of the Silver City or alternatively the Granite City. Smith became known as \\"Tudor Johnny\\" as his later designs around the 1830s, particularly for mansions and churches, incorporated a Tudor-Gothic form. However, his civic designs in Aberdeen city remained in a neo-classical style. Miller designates Smith's design for the North Church in Aberdeen as \\"generally considered to be his greatest building\\" and further states \\"Undisputedly by far the finest neoclassical church in the City of Aberdeen.\\" Sited on the corner of Queen Street and King Street the design gained approval from the Town Council in September 1828. The church opened in June 1831 but it was years later before sufficient funding was available to install clocks. A Greek Revival style was used in the construction of the by rectangular building with a circular pepper pot tower set upon a two-stage box tower. It was the tallest building in Aberdeen until its height was surpassed by the spire of the Triple Kirk designed by Simpson. Suitable to seat 1600 at services, congregation numbers declined and the church closed in 1954. It was used as the Aberdeen Arts Centre from the early 1960s. One of the last designs before his death was for Balmoral Castle; he initially did some work re- building the tower for Robert Gordon, 5th son of the 3rd Earl of Aberdeen, who was leasing Balmoral in 1830. Subsequently, he was involved with drawing up the initial plans for the new castle, by this time owned by Queen Victoria and Price Albert after meeting Price Albert on Friday 11 September 1848. After Smith died in 1852 the final designs and work were undertaken by his son William. He is buried with his wife, Margaret Grant, in the churchyard of the Kirk of St Nicholas on Union Street in Aberdeen. Works With a career spanning the years from 1805 until his death in 1852, the list of works Smith was associated with, both in his official capacity as City Architect and private commissions, is lengthy; some examples are given below. =Bridges= Torry side of Wellington Suspension Bridge Captain Samuel Brown designed the Wellington Suspension Bridge, which spanned the River Dee in Aberdeen at Craiglug; Smith competed against Simpson to win the contract to design the structures architectural sections. The bridge opened in May 1831 and featured arched granite pylons. Smith's contract also included building three miles of approach road and he designed/built the toll house at the north-east end of the bridge. Smith's design for the widening of the historic medieval Bridge of Dee in 1841 was described by Paxton and Shipway as \\"an exemplary widening of a historic bridge\\". In 1837, Smith designed the St Devenick's Bridge. It was also known as Morrison's Bridge after Reverend George Morrison who commissioned its design and paid for the construction; another name was the Shakkin' Briggie because it would shake whenever anyone walked over it. The bridge was long with a span of and followed the same style as the Wellington Suspension Bridge. =Castles= Smith felt Craigievar Castle was: \\"one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built.\\" In 1814‚Äì1815 Smith was commissioned to design modifications to Brucklay Castle including remodelling the main entrance hall and frontage; this was in the neoclassical style. Work was also undertaken on the second and third storeys of the north elevation. Returning in 1820, Smith extended the old stable block in a mainly one and a half-storey Gothic style with a central pyramid roofed two-storey tower. That year he also began work on an extensive enlargement of Cluny Castle for Colonel John Gordon. Originally a Z-plan castle built c. 1604, the later extensions were described by architectural historian H. Gordon Slade as \\"the most shocking mis-use of architectural effort and granite in the north east of Scotland.\\" Smith also worked on nearby Castle Fraser constructing an access stairway between the great hall on the first floor and the rear courtyard entrance. The two-storey building it was housed within had a glazed cupola at its centre under a lead roof. Two crow stepped gatehouses were constructed between an arched gateway entrance and various access passages joined the first floor wings. He was also responsible for the library design. Roof repairs carried out at Craigievar Castle were essential in the 1820s as the structure had fallen into decay. The owner, Sir John Forbes, had considered demolishing the tower but Smith advised against it stating it was: \\"one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built.\\" The work lasted two years and involved the re-construction of almost all of the top floor. The windows, external harling and pointing were replaced and it is likely Smith also designed the gardener's cottage. Although Drumtochty Castle was built to the designs of James Gillespie Graham with further extensions c. 1815, the actual work of the extensions was undertaken by Smith. Miller speculates Gillespie Graham could have had a dispute with the owner, George Drummond, but considers Smith's closer proximity to the site is a more plausible scenario. The rugged cliff tops to the north of Cruden Bay were the setting for Slains Castle where, in 1836, Smith was engaged by William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll and Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire to renovate his existing courtyard house into a stylish residence suitable for a person of his standing. Smith's design enveloped the previous building, encasing it in a new structure of pink Peterhead granite and featured round towers. alt=The first of Smith's Tudor-Gothic designs for religious buildings. =Churches= The construction, restoration, renovation or alteration to several parish churches throughout Aberdeenshire, Angus and Kincardineshire are credited to Smith. One of his first rural church designs was at Fintray, Aberdeenshire in 1821; later that year he also designed Udny Parish Church. These formed the basis of designs that Smith would evolve and develop in future years for other parish churches. Udny Parish Church was the first of Smith's Tudor-Gothic ecclesiastic designs. A box tower above the main entrance features a crenellated top with louvred pointed panels, belfry and clock incorporated in the front (south) gable with walls of rough granite. The main church is a basic rectangle with a slated roof. The north aisle of St Machar's Cathedral was restored to Smith's designs in 1832 and the entrance lodges and gateway were re-built. A new session house was also added. He also undertook work at Skene Parish Church in 1840 and constructed the parish church in Longside in 1835. =Country houses= The Observatory at Drinnie's Wood on the Pitfour estate was designed by Smith Smith undertook considerable work for the Fergusons at their Pitfour estate in Aberdeenshire. Starting in 1809, the third laird of Pitfour, James Ferguson commissioned him to design a new house. This was a three-storey house, square by high, with 365 windows. There were Greek pediments included on top of the side elevations, stone margins set into the rendered walls and it conveyed an impression of northern Italy. Over the following years, Smith designed several other structures within the policies at Pitfour. These included: the horseshoe-shape, neo-classical two-storey riding stables to the rear of the mansion during the time of the fifth laird in 1820; gatehouses and bridges; a small replica six-bay Greek Doric temple, styled after the Temple of Theseus; and the Observatory, an eight-sided crenellated three-storey tower. Among other country houses featuring Smith's designs was the Neo-Greek style Dunecht House in 1820. Comprising two storeys and a full basement, it was constructed from granite. A low parapet hid the slate, low pitched roof. The original Smith designed house was later extensively expanded by William, his son. Work was undertaken at Haddo House on the kitchens and peripheral buildings in 1843. He returned there in 1845 and built the gate houses at the North and South entrances. Constructed in a rough coarse granite, these single-storey buildings are in a Tudor style. Sometime before 1830 William Rickart Hepburn commissioned Smith to design Rickarton House in Kincardineshire. Forglen House near Turriff was designed by Smith for Sir Robert Abercromby. The new mansion house was described by architectural historian Charles McKean as an \\"Elizabethan Gothic confection\\". =Other works= The re-construction of the front of King's College, Aberdeen was undertaken by Smith in 1825. The work incorporated other renovations as the building had fallen into a ruinous condition. Designs were drawn up for the section named Cromwell's Tower and its original six storeys were replaced with four modern levels and included a ground floor flat for the housekeeper with classrooms above. Predominantly in a Tudor style, some of the extensive designs were not enacted; however, eventually the joining of the Chapel, Cromwell's Tower and the old Crown Tower was achieved. The work was one of Smith's earlier Tudor-Gothic designs. Smith completed a contract started by William Burn to the back and west boundary walls of Robert Gordon's College with extra wings and other alterations continued from 1830 until 1833. During the same years (1830‚Äì1833) the \\"Ionic Screen\\" at the front of Kirk of St Nicholas on Union Street, Aberdeen was installed. Featuring a triumphal arch with paired Ionic columns set to each side, the columns were originally supposed to be of cast iron. Death and legacy Smith married Margaret Grant, a daughter of George Grant of Auchterblair. Most of their eight children died at an early age but their fourth child, William, joined his father in business and also became city architect in Aberdeen. The couple also had a daughter, Margaret Grant Smith. Having suffered a lengthy, painful illness, Smith died in 1852 at the home he inherited from his wife's father. There is a plaque to commemorate him sited at the Kirk of St Nicholas in Union Street, Aberdeen. =Gallery= File:Balmoral Castle.jpgBalmoral Castle File:Bridge of Dee Aberdeen.jpgBridge of Dee File:SkakkinBriggie-68509-PeterWard.jpgShakkin' Briggie File:Pitfour House, side view.jpgPitfour House center References = Notes = =Citations= =Bibliography=     Category:1781 births Category:1852 deaths Category:19th-century Scottish architects Category:British neoclassical architects Category:Architects from Aberdeen ","title":"John Smith (architect)"},{"id":"11186541","text":"Rakovski (, ) is a village situated at from Razgrad Train Station (Gara Razgrad) and from the City of Razgrad, Bulgaria.  Overview  Although it has been mainly a minority Turkish village since 17th century the Bulgarian State claims that the village dates back to October 23, 1898 when a Bulgarian school was opened with ten students. The school was located in the lower end of the village where the present village church is built. The first teacher of the school was Liubomir Tarnovski, a voluntary teacher, born in the city of Shumen and completed the 4th grade in the Men's High School in Razgrad. The lower end of the village (located west of today's Municipal building) was called Kasim Kuyucuk until 1931 and later Rakovski as a result of Bulgarian Communist Party's assimilation policy. Until 1931 the upper end of the village (located east of the Municipal building) was called Zincirli Kuyucuk and later Kladentsi. In 1952, the two villages merged and are now known as Rakovski. In the 1980s Rakovski enjoyed a financial and civic prosperity when the majority of the working adults were employed by the glass factory Dianko Stefanov. In the 1980s the local soccer team \\"Ustrem\\" moved from Amateur Division III into Division II and later into Elite A Division. In mid-1980s the school's soccer/football team whose players are generally 7th or 8th graders became province (okrazhni) champions two years in a row and move into regional competition with the teams of Trustenik (Ruse) and Sokol (Silistra). According to official sources, in 2006, Rakovski had a population of 3,737. The Mayor of Rakovski ‚Äî Byunat Tatarov ‚Äî stated that the village has 3,998 inhabitants in 2007 is expected to very soon reach 4,000 people.

As one of artists leading Korean Abstract Painting, he has developed his own philosophy about what contemporary art can propose after Post-modernism. The main subjects of his work are mutual relationship, cycling resonance and dynamic condition between original being and the environment. He suggests consistently that the distance or emptiness makes being exist and that there is no clear boundary anywhere. Life Born in 1946, Lee Dong Youb graduated from Hong-Ik University and the graduate school. He got married with Lee Hye-Ran, the founder of Seoul Gallery where he held the first solo exhibition, in 1977. He has had solo exhibitions more than ten times such as in Seoul and Tokyo. He has participated in many group exhibitions in Japan, Seoul, New York, and Paris including the first \`Independent' exhibition which sponsored by Korean Fine Arts Association. He lives in Seoul with his family. Work He gives effort to show extremely expressing formality about white color and air through work. His work is far, broad, deep, and difficult because he has pursued the echo of cosmic perception from his early days. Bokijae of ancient times determined anonymous sky and ground as source of recognition, and made basic symbol emblem as drawing a line in the sky of empty like Taegeuk of national flag of Korea. He has employed his artistic indication from attitude, which conveys the representative symbol of quickening perfection from vibration of Biui, which has conceived from the ancient times. Therefore, his early works of 10 years ago occurred extraordinary attention which has kept until now. > Lew, June Sang (art critic, former chief curator of National Museum of > Contemporary Art of Korea): When I said that \\"The vertical axis is vibrating > delicately,\\" I said so because since the drawn contours of vertical shapes > are standing in a minor grading of shade and shadow, a phenomenon can be > perceived in which the vertical steel, when struck, shakes to the left and > the right for a while producing some lingering sounds in the wake. > Yusuke NAKAHARA (art critic): His works are typified by the annihilation of > objects.

Her four brothers were also doctors. Professional career In 1906 Aspinall applied for residency at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA), but her application was initially rejected by the board. Her father took up her cause and had a long letter published in the Sydney Morning Herald early in February. This drew the attention of the public and of many different groups to the rejection of Jessie's application by the hospital, with one commentator concluding that: Amid protests from Women's Rights Groups and intense media scrutiny, the board reversed its decision on 2 May. She practiced at RPA until June 1907, when she was appointed the junior house surgeon at the General Hospital, Hobart. In 1908 Jessie was appointed Resident Medical Officer of the Crown Street Women's Hospital, Sydney, and would progress to become Medical Superintendent of the institution. Eventually Jessie moved into private practice, and had consulting rooms at Lyon's Terrace and Macquarie Street, both in central Sydney. Aspinall also served as the school doctor for The Scots College. Family background and education Jessie Aspinall was born in Forbes, New South Wales, the third daughter of the Rev. Arthur Aspinall and his wife Helen, the only one to survive to adulthood. Upon moving to Sydney she studied at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, Riviere College and Kambala before earning her Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Sydney. On 22 June 1915 Aspinall married mining engineer Ambrose William Freeman, to whom she bore 4 children: two sons and two daughters, one of whom married the Australian artist, Peter Michael Blayney; thus making Jessie Aspinall/Freeman the mother-in-law of the artist. The family spent two periods living in Malaya. Jessie died of arteriosclerosis. Her ashes were interred in the family grave at the South Head Cemetery. Cultural activities Aspinall was actively involved with the Sydney executive of the Victoria League, the National Council of Women and the appeals committee of the Young Women's Christian Association.

It was the last of the Sony Ericsson \\"P\\" Smartphone series, introduced in 2002 with the Sony Ericsson P800 and it integrates many of the hardware features of its predecessor the P990 in the form factor of the M600. It was announced on 8 May 2007. There is a Chinese version of P1 called P1c. Compare with P1/ P1i, P1c lacks of 3G, thereby using EDGE which is much slower but more available especially in the US and parts of Europe. The phone uses the UIQ 3.0 software platform, which is based upon Symbian OS 9.1. It is slightly thicker than the M600 as a result of the new hardware features, but this is reportedly largely indiscernible. It is nonetheless considerably thinner than the P990 (25% smaller - as the official press review states). Key improvements As a result of its increased RAM, the P1's multitasking performance is more stable than that of the first batch of UIQ 3 phones from Sony Ericsson (P990, M600 and W950). The boot speed, when compared to the P990, is also discernibly faster. The P1 uses the form factor of the M600 and consequently shares its screen size of 2.6 inches, making it 0.2 inches smaller than its predecessor. However, due to the new transflective layer on its LCD display, legibility under direct sunlight has been improved on the P1. This addresses a common problem faced by owners of the P990. The phone has 256 MB of ROM; twice as much as its predecessor. The P1 also has 160 MB of built in storage, which can be expanded by up to 16 GB using its Memory Stick Micro slot.

The Prime Minister's office declined to comment on the invitation. This followed the report that he had visited Scores in September 2003 with New York Post editor Col Allan and Labor back bencher Warren Snowdon. At the time, Rudd was the Opposition Foreign Affairs spokesman and did not have a \\"completely clear recollection\\" of the visit, stating he had \\"drunk a fair bit\\". The revelation did not have an adverse effect on his standing in the opinion polls but he distanced himself from the event none-the-less.

It is situated approximately south of Hornsea and lies just east of the B1242 road towards the North Sea coast. Its name means a hill where charcoal was burnt. It forms part of the civil parish of Mappleton. Lark Hill Beach The Royal Air Force operated a bombing range on the beach at Cowden between 1959 and 1998. The range was closed due to coastal erosion, which is quite common on the East Riding coast. The erosion regularly reveals buried ordnance which requires the MoD bomb disposal teams to attend and make them safe. The local HM Coastguard team at Hornsea frequently attend reports of ordnance in the first instance and send the details to the Humber Coastguard Operations Centre and EOD ops centre to decide on the appropriate means of disposal. All ordnance found on the coast should be reported to the Coastguard by dialling 999. No. 5131(BD) Squadron used to deploy from RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire to make the old bombs safe but were disbanded in 2019 with the British Army and Royal Navy EOD teams continuing to operate nationally.

It was opened in June 1900 and is built on a prominent position overlooking Fistral Beach and Towan Head. History Slivanus Trevail had begun to sense the potential of catering to visitors brought by the Great Western Railway Company. Trevail‚Äôs Great Western Hotel at Newquay, completed in 1879, was the first in a string of hotels designed to appeal to renewed interest in Cornwall as a winter resort for the middle classes. His Cornish Hotels Company was set up in 1890 to tap that market. After his Atlantic Hotel was built in 1892 he intended to build an upmarket estate, with a luxury hotel, on the headlands of Newquay but lack of money hampered his plans. This scheme provoked a lot of opposition from the local people of Newquay. When building finally began on the Headland Hotel in 1897, riots broke out in the town as it threatened the local custom of using the clifftop as grazing land and space to dry fishermen‚Äôs nets. A lack of communication with local people caused them to riot over a building that was never intended to be on the land given to the town. This, together with planning problems caused by Newquay council, delayed completion until June 1900 by which time a rival hotel, the Victoria, where construction had started later, was already open. The contractor for the Headland was Arthur Carkeek of Redruth with the terracotta coming from Ruabon, North Wales. James Shoolbred & Co of London supplied most of the furniture. Trevail suggested The hotel would be 'The largest hotel in the west', twice the size of the Atlantic hotel and in a better position. The building lavishly decorated with red Rueben terracotta columns and pediments. It would have an electric lift and electric lighting in all rooms. Originally the cost of building the hotel was estimated at ¬£25,000 including ¬£4,000‚Äôs worth of terracotta, but Trevail installed luxurious furnishings from Heal‚Äôs of London, expensive kitchen equipment, a tennis court and 4 croquet lawn.‚Äù The eventual cost was ¬£50,000 all together. The hotel received its first guests in June 1900. It is, according to Nikolaus Pevsner, \\"decidedly disappointing, Victorian, yellow and red brick, tall and symmetrical, pavilion roofs and no redeeming features\\".Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. revised by Enid Radcliffe. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 126 It is one of the few hotels in Newquay to retain its original appearance. In 1911, Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother Prince Albert (later Kings Edward VIII and George VI respectively) recuperated at the hotel after catching measles and mumps while studying at Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Popular culture The Headland Hotel is the setting of an adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel The Witches, and was renamed \\"Hotel Excelsior\\" for the film of 1990.

The NDG Auckland Centre is a proposed tower block consisting of a Ritz-Carlton hotel skyscraper in Auckland, New Zealand. If built it would be the tallest building in New Zealand at a height of and the second-tallest freestanding structure in Auckland after the Sky Tower. The project was first announced by the Dae Ju Group as the 'Elliott Tower', with planning permission granted in 2007, but general economic trends halted further progress as of April 2009, and in mid-2012 the site was sold to Chinese hotel developer, Furu Ding. Furu Ding announced in early 2014 that the development would proceed as the NDG Auckland Centre, but as of 2019 there is no start date set for construction.  Project history  The site on Albert St was originally occupied by the Royal International Hotel before it was bulldozed by Chase Corporation in 1987 for a high-rise development that never proceeded. After a succession of owners, the Korean-based Dae Ju Group purchased the site in 2003. Elliott Tower was granted planning permission in October 2007 (with the subsequent building consents still outstanding), and would be located on the block bounded by Elliott, Victoria and Albert Streets, on an empty lot which is currently being occupied by a car park and a reverse bungy ride. The tower was originally proposed at 232 m (761 ft). However, a late 2007 Environment Court appeal had to be successfully resolved before the building could go forward. SkyCity Auckland, owners of the nearby Sky Tower, alleged that the building would interfere with the use of communications equipment installed on the tower, and lead to future conflicts over privacy within the new apartments which could conceivably be seen into from the tower. Law firm Philips Fox DLA also joined the appeal, claiming the tower went against planning policies.SkyCity, law firm fight plan for tower ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Monday 26 November 2006, Page C13 By the end of June 2008, these appeals were dropped after an out-of-court settlement, clearing the way for the Elliott Tower to proceed. Construction was originally scheduled to start in 2009, with an estimated completion date of 2013. The project was dormant due to the 2008 financial crisis.Global woes hammer big projects ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald. In December 2013, the chairman of the Auckland Business Forum Michael Barnett suggested that the construction of the tower would begin in the next two years, along with the construction of the SkyCity convention centre. However, due to complications of the City Rail Link being constructed beneath the site of the NDG tower block, the construction was postponed until further notice. In 2017, the project was granted consent by the Overseas Investment Office. In the same year NDG stated that the construction of the NDG Auckland Centre would be dependent on the City Rail Link, which is currently under construction with an estimated completion date of 2024. As of July 2019, there is no start date or completion date for construction and the site is used as a carpark.  Characteristics  The tower would principally serve as an apartment complex targeted at the upper market, with two penthouses (445 and 590 square metres) on the top two floorsMassive apartment tower planned ‚Äì National Business Review, 14 November 2006 and 57 levels of apartments (52 above ground, 5 below ground, all facing both west and east) for a total of about 800 residents. Three levels of retail podium and six levels of basement car parking were also proposed. The design incorporated solar panels, carbon sink plantings to offset building service emissions, and a co-generation plant for energy efficiency. A rainwater-capture system was also proposed, and two sky gardens and a public garden on the retail podium would be available for residents and customers. The sky gardens have also been mooted as breaking up the facade, providing for visual and wind movement benefits. The under construction Aotea railway station would adjoin the site.  Construction  When construction was first proposed in 2007, it was estimated the project would have been completed in 2011, with the equivalent of around 500 full-time workers employed in its construction. The original developers were Dae Ju Group, a Korean construction firm that was also working on plans for other buildings around the Auckland CBD area. That firm estimated a $450 million value upon completion of the tower. In May 2017, following approval by the Overseas Investment Office, the construction cost was estimated to be $350 million.

Biography =Early life= Dale Park, Sussex (John Preston Neale, 1829) John Smith was born on 6 September 1767. He was the sixth son of Abel Smith II (1717-1788), a Nottingham banker who was a Member of Parliament for Aldborough, St Ives, and St Germans, and the brother of Robert Smith, 1st Baron Carrington. He lived at Blendon Hall in Kent and finally at Dale Park in Sussex. There is a fine memorial to him in Chichester Cathedral, comprising his recumbent effigy atop a chest tomb set within a gothic-arched niche.See image =Career= He served as a Tory Member of Parliament for Wendover from 1802 to 1806 and later represented Nottingham from 1806 to 1818, Midhurst from 1818 to 1830, Chichester from 1830 to 1831, and Buckinghamshire from 1831 to 1835. (He was also elected for Midhurst in 1806, but preferred to sit for Nottingham on that occasion. Both Wendover and Midhurst were pocket boroughs controlled by his brother Lord Carrington, but the competitive Nottingham constituency was considerably more prestigious.) Between 1800 and 1831 when pocket boroughs were abolished 12 members of the Smith family sat for the Midhurst parliamentary seat alone. In 1806, Smith served as a Manager of the newly formed London Institution. =Personal life and death= He married three times. By his second wife, Mary Tucker (1773‚Äì1809), he had two sons, John Abel Smith (1802‚Äì1871), who succeeded him as MP for Midhurst, and Martin Tucker Smith (1803‚Äì1890), who became MP for Wycombe; and he had two daughters by his third wife, Emma Leigh, including the writer, Caroline Leigh Gascoigne. He died on 20 January 1842 at Dale Park when he was accidentally poisoned by his nearly-blind wife, who gave him an overdose of laudanum.History , Parks and Gardens, Retrieved 16 April 2017 His great-grandson Vivian Smith was created Baron Bicester in 1938.

Summary Lady Jessica Nepean is fond of flirtation, not so much because she is dissatisfied with her husband, Gilbert, as because it flatters her vanity to keep other men dangling just on the edge of proposal. At the houseparty of her sister, Lady Rosamund Tatton, her flirtation with Edward Falkner, a recently returned South African hero, is the theme of conversation. Everyone insists that Sir Christopher Deering (who had socially stood sponsor for Falkner) must reason him out of his infatuation for Lady Jessica before her husband realizes what she does. The women of the party also attempt to reason with Lady Jessica. Both attempts, however, are foredoomed. Falkner is desperately in love with Lady Jessica, as only a lonely and serious man can be. Lady Jessica is enjoying his ardor immensely, and still believes she can end it with a word. Business calls Gilbert Nepean away, so when the houseparty breaks up Lady Jessica keeps an appointment to have dinner with Falkner at the inn where he is staying. Her husband's brother, George accidentally comes upon her there and, putting the worst possible construction on it, feels himself bound to wire Gilbert to return at once. Lady Jessica happens to see Rosamund and Freddie rowing down the river, and manages to get her sister into the inn. In hopes to forestall George they write Gilbert a letter asking him to call at Lady Rosamund's town house the next morning for an explanation. About the time Gilbert is due, most of the other members of the houseparty turn up at Lady Rosamund's on some pretext or other. When Gilbert arrives, he is met with a most amazing barrage of lies. To complicate the situation, he has already seen a member of the houseparty on his way from the station, and by a chance remark of hers recognizes these subsequent explanations as lies. Finally when Lady Jessica sees that they are hopelessly involved, she bids Falkner tell the truth. By this time she imagines herself as much in love with him as he with her and is ready to run away with him. Sir Christopher, however, is determined that his friend shall not sacrifice his brilliant career for a shallow woman. He manages to reconcile Lady Jessica and her husband by the simple process of blaming Gilbert for the whole affair. \\"In future,\\" Sir Christopher advises, \\"flirt with your wife yourself if you don't want some other man to do it.\\" Themes Although the play is a sophisticated comedy that shows Jones' contact with London high society, the play displays a rigid acceptance of the Victorian moral code.

It was an overwhelming victory for Ferrara.  The battle  In 1509 the Venetian fleet was moored on the river Po, waiting for the right moment to attack Ferrara. Meanwhile, the Slavic and Albanian mercenaries (called Stratioti) made daily incursions into the Dukedom, sowing death and terror. On the night of 21-22 December, given the high level reached by the waters of the Po, that had brought the enemy galleys up to the level of the embankment, the Ferrarese forces set up their artillery along the river and at dawn opened fire. In the indescribable chaos that followed this surprise action, many ships were sunk and others captured. The soldiers and sailors who tried to escape into the water were taken prisoner and shot or killed without mercy as soon as they reached firm ground. It was rather a massacre than a battle. The troops of Ferrara captured 15 galleys and a number of other ships. The Venetians lost 2,000 killed or drowned and 60 flags. Angelo Trevisan succeeded in fleeing, but his damaged galley sank 5 km further. Back in Venice, he was tried for \\"misconduct and carelessness\\". When Duke Alfonso I d'Este entered Ferrara five days later, his wife Lucrezia Borgia was waiting for him with her maids of honour, the court, and the jubilant population. The battle was described by Ludovico Ariosto in his epic poem Orlando Furioso (canto 40, 2, vv. 1-4).

Asenath was an Egyptian woman whom Pharaoh gave to Joseph as wife, and the daughter of Potipherah, a priest of On (). Manasseh was born in Egypt before the arrival of the children of Israel from Canaan (). Biblical narrative Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph by Rembrandt, 1656. Genesis 48 describes how Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh. According to the biblical account in Genesis 41:51 Joseph named Manasseh meaning \\"God has made me forget entirely my troubles and my father\\"s house‚Äù; Genesis 41:51 states that the name of Manasseh. Jacob, Joseph's father, adopted Joseph's two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to share in Jacob's inheritance equally with Jacob's own sons (). He is counted as the father of the Israelite Tribe of Manasseh, one of the twelve Israelite tribes. Jacob also blessed Ephraim over his older brother (). Manasseh had a son, Asriel, with his wife; and Machir with his Aramean concubine (). and refer to a son called Jair, who \\"took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and [who] called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair. Biblical criticism In the Biblical account, Joseph's other son is Ephraim, and Joseph himself is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, the other being Benjamin. Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Manasseh and Ephraim were considered one tribe - that of Joseph;Jewish Encyclopedia, Ephraim according to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.Peake's commentary on the Bible A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the Joseph tribes (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout.Israel Finkelstein, The Bible Unearthed According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and doesn't mention the other tribal matriarchs at all.Richard Elliott Friedman, Who Wrote the Bible? The Book of Chronicles states that Manasseh was married to an Aramean concubine, and that they had two sons, named Asriel and Machir; in the Torah's genealogy of Manasseh's family, which textual scholars ascribe to the earlier priestly source, Asriel instead appears to be the son of Gilead, the son of Machir.Numbers 26:29-34Richard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the Bible? Near the end of the book of Genesis, according to some English translations of the Bible (such as the King James Version), Manasseh's grandchildren are described as having been brought up upon Joseph's knees,Genesis 50:23, King James Version while other English translations (such as the Revised Version) render the same text as born upon Joseph's knees;Genesis 50:23, Revised Standard Version the gloss for this passage given by some English translations (such as the New International Version) is that the grandchildren were adopted by Joseph as his own children, at the moment they were born.  Rabbinical interpretations  In the Torah, the eventual precedence of the tribe of Ephraim is argued to derive from Joseph tricking Jacob, blind and on his deathbed, into blessing Ephraim before Manessah.Genesis 41:52Genesis 48:1 The text describing this blessing features a hapax legomenon ‚Äì the word ◊©◊õ◊ú (sh- k-l) ‚Äì which classical rabbinical literature has interpreted in esoteric manners;Jewish Encyclopedia some rabbinical sources connect the term with sekel, meaning mind/wisdom, and view it as indicating that Jacob was entirely aware of who he was actually blessing; other rabbinical sources connect the term with shikkel, viewing it as signifying that Jacob was despoiling Manasseh in favour of Ephraim; yet other rabbinical sources argue that it refers to the power of Jacob to instruct and guide the holy spirit. The Targum Pseudo- Jonathan argues that Manasseh had been a steward in Joseph's household, and had acted as an interpreter between Joseph and his other brothers; this targum also mentions that Manasseh had unusually large strength.

The obstruction is often caused by an imperforate hymen or less commonly a transverse vaginal septum. The fluid consists of cervical and endometrial mucus or in rare instances urine accumulated through a vesicovaginal fistula proximal to the obstruction. In some cases, it is associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. If it occurs in prepubertal girls, it may show up as abdominal swelling. It may be detected by using ultrasound. Prenatal diagnosis and early newborn imaging studies leads to early detection and treatment of these cases. It may also present at birth as a distended lower abdomen and vagina.

Sunni Hanafi Muslim by origin, the Memon people are entrepreneurs and traders who settled in Ceylon (in modern Sri Lanka) for business opportunities during the colonial period. Some of these people came to the country as far back as the Portuguese period. Memons arrived during the British period from the Kathiawar region (in modern state of Gujarat, India) during the Partition of India in 1947. Majority of Memons arrived in Sri Lanka were from the historical village called Kutiyana, in Junagadh District, State of Gujarat, India. Along with the Kathiawar Memons, many Other Memon families from out of the popular Kathiawar Memon villages also arrived, and they are known and identified as the Mir, Pinjara, Allahrakha, khatri and Mulla within the Memon community in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan Memons are strictly following the traditional and cultural values of the International Memon community. Memons in Sri Lanka are represented by the Memon Association of Sri Lanka.  History  Ceylon - Place of gathering (Jamath Khana) for Memons in Colombo in the year 1956 Early 1900s, Kathiawar Memon merchants and traders; mainly from Kutiyana, Porbandar and Upleta traveled to Ceylon (in modern Sri Lanka) to trade and exploit business opportunities. Memon people started the trading route between India and Sri lanka in early 1930s. Memon merchants brought variety of Indian products to Ceylon (in modern Sri Lanka), it mainly consisted textiles and it was sold in the Colombo Pettah market. Reason for mass migration and settlement of Memon people around the world was due to the Gujarat's Hindu-Muslim riot in 1947, which was initiated due to the Partition of India. Many Memons in the Kathiawar region were attacked and were looted by the mobs, which resulted in great loss to the Memon community especially in the Junagadh District and surrounding villages in modern state of Gujarat in India. After the riots, extremely affected Memon people from the Kathiawar region were replaced in refugee camps in the bordering cities nearby the State of Gujarat, India. Lately, Memon people started migrating to other states within India, and large number of them migrated and settled in modern Pakistan. Memon merchants who were involved in the trading route between India and Sri Lanka, decided to migrate and settle in Ceylon (in modern Sri Lanka) along with their families. Memon people were firstly based in Colombo 12 in the early 1950s and gradually started to expand and move to other parts of the Colombo city. Memon association of Ceylon was formed in the year 1956 in Hullsdorf, Colombo by well known personalities of the Memon community in Sri Lanka.

He was the Deputy Chairman of United Overseas Bank (\\"UOB\\"), one of the 'Big 3' local banks in Singapore for five years. He resigned in December 1985 after 18 years of service with UOB to pursue other business interests. In 1985, Allan Ng served as the Chairman of the Singapore Association of Banks, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, and a member of the Crime Prevention Council in Singapore. Also in 1985, he was appointed a member of the Singapore Government Economic Committee, headed by the then Minister of Trade and Industry, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, and was also Chairman of the Banking and Finance Sub-Committee. In 1986, Allan Ng teamed up with Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a former banker and hotelier, to acquire a 29.9% interest in EXCO International, a UK financial services group, and a 13.5% interest in Standard Chartered Bank Plc (\\"StanChart\\"). He was appointed a director and Chairman of the Executive Committee of EXCO International and an alternate director of Standard Chartered Bank. This Standard Chartered stake was subsequently sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in 2004 following Tan Sri Khoo's death. Also in 1986, he was Chairman of First City Holdings Group Limited (\\"First City\\"), a 50/50 joint venture between Allan Ng and Tan Sri Khoo, which acquired a 23% interest in Sealion Hotels Limited (\\"Sealion\\"), owner of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore. First City's wholly owned subsidiary, First City Investment Pte Ltd (\\"FCI\\"), accepted an offer to acquire an additional 1 million shares in Sealion at 60 cents per share from Tsang & Ong Stockbrokers when the shares of Sealion were still suspended. This additional purchase of 1 million shares by FCI was publicly announced and disclosed to the Stock Exchange of Singapore. In 1988, Allan Ng was charged with insider trading for causing FCI on 8 October 1986 to purchase 1 million shares in Sealion, (later renamed as First Capital Corporation Limited) while having prior knowledge that Sealion had requested the Stock Exchange of Singapore to lift the suspension of trading of its shares. Allan Ng pleaded guilty following a trial in 1989 that lasted 77 days and many days of cross-examination by Glenn Knight, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, making it the longest trial in Singapore at that time. In May 1989, Singapore abolished the right to appeal to the UK Privy Council except for criminal cases involving the death penalty or in civil cases where the parties had agreed to such a right of appeal. On 16 September 1989, he was convicted and sentenced to 12 months‚Äô imprisonment by the district court judge for violating the Securities Industry Act. The imprisonment term was suspended pending appeal. In 1991, he was successful in his appeal to the High Court, which set aside the sentence of imprisonment and instead imposed a fine of S$50,000. The High Court Judge, M. Karthigesu, accepted Allan Ng's counsel, Mr Michael Sherrard QC's submission that a custodial sentence was inappropriate, unnecessary and excessive because of the very unusual circumstances of this case. Judge Karthigesu also accepted the submission that this case was \\"very unlike the more usual case of insider dealing where dishonest financial plunder was the object\\". He highlighted that there was no evidence that Allan Ng or FCI were out to make a \\"killing\\" as there was \\"no attempt made by Allan Ng to sell the 1 million shares in the first week after the lifting of suspension when the price went up to about 77 cents\\". In 1992, Allan Ng and his family emigrated to Vancouver, Canada following their successful application for permanent residence. The Canadian Immigration and the Justice Ministry held that the conviction in Singapore did not render Allan Ng an \\"inadmissible person\\" under the Canadian Immigration Act and hence granted him and his family permanent residence status. In early 1994, Mr. Robert Kuok, Chairman of the Kerry Group (a conglomerate which owned the Shangri-La hotels, properties, media, and palm oil plantations, etc.) invited Allan Ng to join the Kerry Group. He was appointed Chairman of Kerry Properties, a major public listed company in Hong Kong, and also Vice-Chairman of Kerry Holdings Limited. In 1999, he left the Kerry Group to start his own investment firm, Newmark Capital Corporation Limited (\\"Newmark Capital\\"). Newmark Capital's investments included an 11% stake in CyberCity Holdings (\\"CyberCity\\"), which developed the Shenzhen CyberCity Business Park as well as a business park in Beijing (a joint venture with Tsinghua University) in 2000. Newmark Capital was the second largest shareholder in CyberCity after Dr. Simon Jiang, founder and largest shareholder. Other substantial shareholders in CyberCity included Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Ascendas Pte Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore's Jurong Town Corporation) and Fraser & Neave Ltd (\\"F&N;\\"). Newmark Capital and Dr. Simon Jiang's stakes in CyberCity were subsequently acquired by Ascendas Pte Ltd, which together with F&N;, now control CyberCity through Fraser Property (China) Limited. Currently, Allan Ng is the Chairman of Newmark Capital whose principal business activities include investments in real estate, private equity, hedge funds and stakes in pre-IPO companies and public-listed companies in Hong Kong and China.

From 1783 to 1794 he volunteered in the Prussian army as a musketeer. During the War of the first coalition his regiment (v. Thadden) campaigned in Valmy. Laukhard's military diary is of great interest for historical research on the Prussian army and the French revolutionary wars. Due to his licentious and extrovert lifestyle, \\"Magister Laukhard\\" soon became a notorious figure. Life = Youth= Laukhard was born in Wendelsheim where his father Philipp Burkhard Laukhard served as pastor. He was trained in Latin, Hebrew and Philosophy from an early age. Laukhards father, himself a Pantheist, was a great admirer of Christian von Wolff and Baruch Spinoza, always encouraging Laukhard to query canonical dogmata to become a freethinker. Though his intellectual breeding was highly excitatory, his parents completely disregarded any further educational surveillance. As a result, Laukhard got in bad company and became an alcoholic in early years. =Studies= At his father's urging, Laukhard began to study theology at the university of Gie√üen in 1771. After his graduation in 1774, Laukhard served for a while as Vikar, but he lost this position quickly on account of his overly liberal sermons. In 1781, supported by his father's friend Johann Salomo Semler, he resumed his studies in Halle. In 1783 he finally earned his doctorate and served for short while at the University of Halle. =Army= Battle of Valmy Due to his bohemian and costly lifestyle, Laukhard got plunged in debt and had to enter the Prussian army. In 1792 he took part in the battle of Valmy. In 1794 he was captured by the French and henceforth became a member of the Sansculottes. Influence Laukhard Memorial Wendelsheim Laukhards autobiographic writings are of historical interest. In his lifetime he made a contribution to the spread of humanist ideas and thus can be seen as part of the enlightenment movement.

Secular Franciscans are not like the other third orders, since they are not under the higher direction of the same institute. Brothers and sisters of the Secular Franciscan Order profess to their own Rule, and Secular Franciscan fraternities can exist without the presence of the first or second Franciscan Orders. The Secular Franciscan Order was the third of the three families founded by Saint Francis of Assisi 800 years ago. Originally known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, the Order is open to any Catholic not bound by religious vows to another religious order and is made up of both the laity (male and female non-clergy) and secular clergy (deacons, priests, bishops and even Popes). Although Secular Franciscans make a public profession and are consecrated, they are not bound by public vows as are religious living in community. The Third Order Regular (TOR), which grew out of the Third Order Secular, do make religious vows and live in community. Because the Order belongs to the spiritual family of the Franciscans, the Holy See has entrusted its pastoral care and spiritual assistance to the Franciscan First Order (Order of Friars Minor, Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, and Order of Friars Minor Conventual) and Franciscan Third Order Regular (TOR), which belong to the same spiritual family. History =Foundation of the Secular Third Order= The Secular Franciscan Order and other Franciscan movements are disciples of St. Francis of Assisi (1182‚Äì1226). Painting by El Greco (1541‚Äì1614). The preaching of St. Francis, as well as his example, exercised such a powerful attraction on people that many married men and women wanted to join the First or the Second Order. Because being married was incompatible with the order, Francis found a middle way and gave them a rule animated by the Franciscan spirit. In the composition of this rule St. Francis was assisted by his friend Cardinal Ugolino di Conti (later Pope Gregory IX).Jarrett, Bede, Ferdinand Heckmann, Benedict Zimmerman, Livarius Oliger, Odoric Jouve, Lawrence Hess, and John Doyle. \\"Third Orders.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 13 June 2016 Where the Third Order was first introduced is unknown. The preponderance of opinion is Florence, chiefly on the authority of Mariano of Florence, or Faenza, who cites the first papal bull known on the subject (Regesta pontificum). The less authoritative Fioretti assigns Cannara, a small town two hours' walk from the Portiuncula, as the birthplace of the Third Order. Mariano, Thomas of Celano, and the Bull for Faenza (16 December 1221) suggest that 1221 was the earliest date for founding of the Third Order. Another story tells of Luchesius Modestini, a greedy merchant from Poggibonzi, who had his life changed by meeting Francis about 1213. He and his wife Buonadonna were moved to dedicate their lives to prayer and serving the poor. While many couples of that era who experienced a religious conversion chose to separate and enter monasteries, this couple felt called to live out this new way of life together. Francis was moved to write a Rule for them which would allow them to do so. Thus began the Brothers and Sisters of Penance in the Franciscan movement, which came to be called the Franciscan Third Order. The Chiesa della Buona Morte in the city of Cannara (Church of the Good Death, previously named \\"Church of the Stigmata of S. Francesco\\") claims to be the birthplace of the Third Order. Another contender from the same city is the Church of S. Francesco. This way of life was quickly embraced by many couples and single men and women who did not feel called to the stark poverty of the friars and nuns, especially widows. They zealously practiced the lessons Francis taught concerning prayer, humility, peacemaking, self-denial, fidelity to the duties of their state, and above all charity. Like Francis, they cared for lepers and outcasts. Even canonical hermits were able to follow this Rule and bring themselves into the orbit of the Franciscan vision. The Order came to be a force in the medieval legal system, since one of its tenets forbade the use of arms, and thus the male members of the order could not be drafted into the constant and frequent battles between cities and regions in that era. =Third Order of St. Francis in Canada= The Third Order of St. Francis was established by the Recollects at Quebec in 1671 and later at Three Rivers and Montreal. In 1681 a Recollect notes that \\"many pious people of Quebec belong to the Third Order\\". After the cession of Canada to England in 1763 following the French defeat in the Seven Years' War, the Third Order, deprived of its directors, gradually disappeared but was revived In the 1840s. The 1840 revival was led by Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal. Noted naturalist L√©on Abel Provancher was particularly active. In 1866, having received faculties from the General of the Friars Minor, Provancher established a fraternity in his parish at Portneuf Quebec,Phillips, Edward. \\"L√©on Abel Provancher.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 Jun. 2016 and promoted the Third Order in his writings. For two years he edited a monthly review he published on the Third Order. On a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Provancher met Fr√©d√©ric Janssoone and the two became friends. In 1881 Janssoone went to Canada, where he gave new spirit to the Third Order, inaugurating and visiting fraternities. On one occasion, he preached a four- hour sermon on the Stations of the Cross in the church of Sainte-Marie- Madeleine in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, to a women's Third Order group from Montreal.{{Cite newsurl=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/janssoone_frederic_14E.htmltitle=Biography ‚Äì JANSSOONE, FR(+_+), several bishops, among them Bishop Louis-Fran√ßois Richer Lafl√®che of Trois-Rivi√®res and Archbishop Taschereau, welcomed him as its promoter. The foundation of a community of Friars Minor at Montreal in 1890 inaugurated a new era of growth for the Third Order. As of 2016 there were over 5,000 active members in approximately 200 fraternities.Secular Franciscan Order, National Fraternity of Canada =Third Order of St. Francis in Great Britain= Little is known of the Third Order in Great Britain prior to the Reformation. In 1385 there were 8 fraternities in the British Isles, compared with twenty-nine in France. Fr. William Staney, the first commissary of the order in England after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, wrote \\"A Treatise of the Third Order of St. Francis\\", published at Douai in 1617. Alice Ingham became a member of the lay society of the third order of St Francis in 1872. She later went on to found the Sisters of St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions. In 1877 the English Franciscans initiated publication of The Franciscan Annual and monthly bulletin of the Third Order. A national conference of British tertiaries, with a view to strengthening and consolidating the order, was held in 1898 at Liverpool. A second national conference was held at Leeds. As in other regions, the members of the Order are now self-governing, under the auspices of a National Fraternity. In Britain, the National Fraternity is made up of nine regional fraternities. In Scotland there are fraternities in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Inverness.National Fraternity of the Secular Franciscan Order in Great Britain (OFSGB) =Third Order of St. Francis in Ireland= The Third Order was active in Dublin during the medieval period. There were tertiaries assisting the Conventual Franciscans at Drogheda in 1855. Although the friary closed in 2000, the Secular Franciscans continue to meet in Drogheda. A renewal of the Third Order in Dublin began around 1860. A fraternity was established by the Capuchins in Cork in 1866 and another in Kilkenny. Matt Talbot joined the Third Order in Merchants Quay in 1890. Merchants Quay was later turned into a Third Order Centre with rooms where tertiaries could meet and relax. In the late nineteenth century the Irish Franciscans produced the Irish Franciscan Tertiary, a monthly journal for the Third Order Franciscans. Six hundred tertiaries met in Dublin in 1971 to celebrate the seven hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the order. As of 2014, Secular Franciscans in Ireland numbered over 1200.\\"The President‚Äôs Address at the SFO Assembly at All Hallows. August 2014\\", News and Views, Secular Franciscans Ireland. September 24, 2014 =Third Order of St. Francis in the United States= Early Franciscan missionaries established fraternities in the Southern and Southwestern states, where there was extensive French and Spanish Catholic influence. A fraternity was established at Santa Fe before 1680. Another fraternity operated in Santa Fe, New Mexico almost from the time of the Reconquest (1692‚Äì1695), as reported by the Father Guardian (custos), Jos√© Bernal, dated 17 September 1794. Single individuals among the Indians were sometimes classified as tertiaries. It is likely that a confraternity was founded at St. Augustine, Florida, before the close of the 16th century, as this was the first Spanish settlement in what is now the United States. A confraternity was established at San Antonio, Texas, before the middle of the 18th century. The establishment of provinces of the order of Friars Minor brought about the establishment of many confraternities. In 1919 a number of friar provincials set up a national organization. With the approval of a new Rule in 1978, the fraternities were reorganized as an independent arm of the Franciscan Movement. The National Fraternity of the United States was formed and divided into thirty regions. As of 2016, there are over 12,000 Secular Franciscans in the United States. =Third Order of St. Francis in Oceania= The Secular Franciscans Oceania is the National Fraternity for Australia, Papua New Guinea, Sabah, and Singapore. New Zealand has its own National Fraternity.Secular Franciscans Oceania: History of modern development The Rule The earliest Rule was found in the Guarnacci Library in Volterra. This primitive document is known as the Earlier Exhortation, or the Earlier Version, of \\"The Letter to All the Faithful\\" and was likely composed before 1215. An expanded version, the Later Exhortation, was completed by about 1220. Both Exhortations were composed by Francis. Both documents call the lay faithful to a life of penance, i.e., of turning away from sin and toward God. In the Earlier Exhortation, Francis describes the elements of the conversion process: > 1) love God 2) love one's neighbor 3) turn away from our sinful tendencies > 4) \\"receive the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ\\" and, as a result of > the above, 5) producing worthy fruits of penance ‚Äì a renewed life > characterized by charity, forgiveness and compassion toward others. Francis speaks in ecstatic terms of those who embrace this way of life: \\"Oh, how happy and blessed are these men and women when they do these things and persevere in doing them since the Spirit of the Lord will rest upon them and He will make His home and dwelling among them. They are children of the heavenly Father whose works they do, and they are spouses, brothers and mothers of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\\" The \\"primitive rule\\" was approved by Pope Honorius III in 1221 with the Memoriale Propositi, and revised in 1289 by the Franciscan Pope Nicholas IV with the Supra montem, and by Pope Leo XIII approving in 1883 Misericors Dei Filius. The current rule was given by Pope Paul VI in 1978 with the Apostolic letter Seraphicus Patriarcha and is designed to adapt the Secular Franciscan Order to the changing needs and expectations of the Church. The spirit of the Rule is found in Article 4: :The rule and life of the Secular Franciscan is this: To observe the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ by following the example of St. Francis of Assisi, who made Christ the inspiration and the center of his life with God and people. Christ, the gift of the Father‚Äôs love, is the way to him, the Truth into which the Holy Spirit leads us, and the life which he has come to give abundantly. Secular Franciscans should devote themselves especially to careful reading of the Gospel, going from Gospel to life and life to the Gospel. Structure The Secular Franciscan Order is a public association of the faithful in the Catholic Church.General Constitutions of the Secular Franciscan Order art. 1 ¬ß 5. Retrieved 23 June 2020. It is divided into fraternities at various levels: local, regional, national, and international. The OFS is governed by the universal law of the Church and by its own Rule, Constitutions, Ritual, and statutes. The interpretation of the Rule and of the Constitutions is done by the Holy See. The practical interpretation of the Constitutions, with the purpose of harmonizing its application in different areas and at the various levels of the Order, belongs to the General Chapter of the OFS. The clarification of specific points which require a timely decision belongs to the Presidency of the International Council of the OFS. The International Council of the OFS statutes are approved by the General Chapter of the OFS and confirmed by the Union of the Franciscan Ministers General. National fraternities have their own statutes approved by the Presidency of the International Council of the OFS. The regional and the local fraternities may have their own statutes approved by the council of the higher level. The fraternities at different levels are animated and guided by the minister or president, with the council, in accordance with the Rule, the Constitutions, and their own Statutes. These offices are conferred through elections. NAFRA reports that in the United States there are currently 30 regions, 700 fraternities, and 14,500 professed members. In 2002, the CIOFS reported a worldwide membership of 400,000 professed members. The International Fraternity is constituted by the organic union of all the Catholic Secular Franciscan fraternities in the world. It is identical to the OFS with its own juridical personality within the Church, organized and in conformity with the Constitutions and its own Statutes. The International Fraternity is guided and animated by the Minister or President with the International Council (CIOFS), which has its seat in Rome, Italy. Spirituality =Franciscan spirituality= Francis's spirituality was simply to \\"observe the Gospel.\\" Pope Pius XII stated in 1956: As a summary of the elements of Franciscan spirituality, a Franciscan should live: *in communion with Christ poor and crucified, *in the love of God, *in brother/sisterhood with all people and all of creation, *participating in the life and mission of the Church, *in continual conversion, *in a life of prayer ‚Äì liturgical, personal, communal, *as instruments of peace. Bonaventure (1221‚Äì1274), painting by Claude Fran√ßois, ca. 1650‚Äì1660. =St. Bonaventure= Saint Bonaventure, the seraphic doctor, is regarded as deeply penetrated and imbued with the mind of Saint Francis of Assisi. √âtienne Gilson has said that in reading Saint Bonaventure, one receives the impression that it is if Saint Francis has been raised up and is philosophizing. Bonaventure sought to know God in Him in order to love and serve Him. Besides his popular writing, Bonaventure has written works of pure spirituality in strict dependence and vital application on Christ, because he felt that all knowledge that is not founded on Christ is vain. The work which sums up all his doctrine is the \\"Collationes in Hexaemeron\\", a synthesis of all human knowledge, including spirituality. =Bl. John Duns Scotus= John Duns Scotus (c1266‚Äì1308) The second of the Franciscan masters produced no notable treatise on spirituality, but John Duns Scotus has systematized the primacy on which Franciscan spirituality is founded. He has given many suggestions and produced many texts such that his disciples and his commentators can be guided by him, and thus came to reveal Franciscan thought and its spirituality, though he differs notably from Bonaventure. In early education, in training, and in his days at Oxford as student and later as master, John Duns Scotus deepened the understanding of the real and the concrete. He entered the School to profit from the works of Alexander of Hales, Albert the Great, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, and Roger Bacon. Thus John Duns Scotus joined his predecessor Bonaventure on a similar interpretation of the function and mission of Jesus Christ given by Francis, that Christ is the highest grace God offers His creatures, and their response controls their attitude to God. =Being secular= One of the most important consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances. Intimate union with Christ lies at the heart of the OFS vocation. Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers and sisters, in Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and living in an integrated human and evangelical life. Twenty-first century Secular Franciscans live out the secular aspect of their charism by paying attention to three things. First, they draw on the rich experience of Franciscan figures of the past, who were both contemplative and dedicated to activities as parents, single people, kings, craftsmen, recluses, and people involved in welfare activities. Second, at the beginning of the third millennium, they face a test of their creativity when confronted by the new evangelisation. Third, they cultivate a deep knowledge of Francis the prophet, an example from the past, leading them into the future. =Fraternity= The Secular Franciscan charism is not given to an individual person but to a group of brothers and sisters. Thus from the outset, it is a group that is shaped by the Holy Church, and it is only in this context that the charism can thrive. The fraternity of the Order finds its origin in the inspiration of Francis to whom the Most High revealed the essential Gospel quality of life in fraternal communion. The vocation of the Order is, therefore, a vocation to live the Gospel in fraternal communion. For one's initial formation, participation in the meetings of the local fraternity is an indispensable presupposition for initiation into community of prayer and into fraternal life. Missionary activity Secular Franciscans can be recognized by the Tau Cross they wear as a lapel pin (here) or pendant. The Secular Franciscans commit themselves to live the Gospel according to Franciscan spirituality in their secular condition. The Secular Franciscan must personally and assiduously study the Gospel and Sacred Scripture to foster love for the word of the Gospel and help the brothers and sisters to know and understand it as it is proclaimed by the Church with the assistance of the Spirit. Secular Franciscans, called in earlier times \\"the brothers and sisters of penance\\", propose to live in the spirit of continual conversion. Some means to cultivate this characteristic of the Franciscan vocation, individually and in fraternity, are: listening to and celebrating the Word of God; review of life; spiritual retreats; the help of a spiritual adviser; and penitential celebrations. Secular Franciscans should pledge themselves to live the spirit of the Beatitudes and, in a special way, the spirit of poverty. Evangelical poverty demonstrates confidence in the Father, affects interior freedom, and disposes them to promote a more just distribution of wealth. They must provide for their own families and serve society by means of their work and material goods. They have a particular manner of living evangelical poverty. To understand and achieve it requires a strong personal commitment and the stimulation of the fraternity in prayer and dialogue, communal review of life, and attentiveness to the instructions of the Church and the demands of society. They pledge themselves to reduce their own personal needs so as to be better able to share spiritual and material goods with their brothers and sisters, especially those most in need. They should give thanks to God for the goods they have received, using them as good stewards and not as owners. They should take a firm position against consumerism and against ideologies and practices which prefer riches over human and religious values and which permit the exploitation of the human person. They should love and practice purity of heart, the source of true fraternity. =Environmental justice= Following the example of Saint Francis of Assisi, Patron of Ecology, they collaborate with efforts to fight pollution and to conserve all that is valuable in nature. This conservation keeps in mind that the exploitation of the environment often puts disproportionate hardships on the poor, especially if they live in the affected areas. =Social justice= Secular Franciscans are called to make their own contribution, inspired by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which the dignity of the human person, shared responsibility, and love may be living realities. They should firmly commit themselves to oppose every form of exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances. =Work and leisure= For Francis, work is a gift and to work is a grace. Daily work is not only the means of livelihood, but the opportunity to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time. =Peace= Secular Franciscans are called to be bearers of peace in their families and in society The renunciation of the use of violence, characteristic of the followers of Francis, does not mean the renunciation of action. Peace is the work of justice and the fruit of reconciliation and of fraternal love. While acknowledging both the personal and national right to self-defense, they should respect the choice of those who, because of conscientious objection, refuse to bear arms. However, the brothers and sisters should take care that their interventions are always inspired by Christian love. =Family= Secular Franciscans should consider their own family to be the first place in which to live their Christian commitment and Franciscan vocation. They should make space within it for prayer, for the Word of God, and for Christian catechesis. They should concern themselves with respect for all life in every situation from conception until death. Married couples find in the Rule of the OFS an effective aid in their own journey of Christian life, aware that in the sacrament of matrimony their love shares in the love that Christ has for his Church. The beauty and the strength of the human love of the spouses is a profound witness for their own family, the Church, and the world. =Youth= Out of the conviction of the need to educate children to take an interest in community, \\"bringing them the awareness of being living, active members of the People of God\\" and because of the fascination which Saint Francis of Assisi can exercise on them, the formation of groups of children should be encouraged. With the help of a pedagogy and an organization suitable to their age, these children should be initiated into a knowledge and love of the Franciscan life. National statutes will give an appropriate orientation for the organization of these groups and their relationship to the fraternity and to the groups of Franciscan youth. The Franciscan Youth is formed by those young people who feel called by the Holy Spirit to share the experience of the Christian life in fraternity, in the light of the message of Francis, deepening their own vocation within the context of the Secular Franciscan Order. =Entrance into the Order, and formation= Conditions for admission are: to profess the Catholic faith, to live in communion with the Church, to be of good moral standing, and to show clear signs of a vocation. Membership in the Order is attained through a time of initiation, a time of formation, and the Profession of the Rule. The journey of formation, which is expected to develop throughout life, begins with entrance into the fraternity. Those responsible for formation are: the candidate, the entire fraternity, the minister with the council, the master of formation, and the assistant as spiritual guide. Profession is the solemn ecclesial act by which the candidate renews the baptismal promises and in a public profession consecrates their lives to the service of God's kingdom and to live the Gospel in the world according to the example of Francis and following the Rule of the OFS. Contemporary Secular Franciscans Membership of the Secular Franciscan Order includes lay men and women as well as diocesan priests. A number of Popes have been members of this Order. Professed members use the letters OFS after their name in line with the official name of the Order. The current rule was given by Pope Paul VI in 1978 with the Apostolic letter Seraphicus Patriarcha. It is designed to adapt the Secular Franciscan Order to the needs and expectations of the Church in the conditions of changing times. Under this new Rule, the tertiaries of the Franciscan movement were set up as an autonomous Order, with their own Minister General as head of the Order. They were removed from the jurisdiction of the friars of the First Order and of the Third Order Regular. In 1990 a new set of Constitutions were written and approved by the General Chapter of the Order held in Madrid, Spain, to clarify issues related to the revised Rule. In A.D. 2000, the appropriate agencies of the Catholic Church, in the name of Pope John Paul II, gave the official approval to the final form of the Constitutions, with an effective date of 8 February 2001. The Order is now known as the Secular Franciscan Order (abbreviated as O.F.S.) The Secular Franciscan Order is a fully recognized order within the Catholic church and part of the Franciscan family. The present active membership of the Order worldwide is about 350,000. A summary of the elements of Franciscan spirituality, includes living in communion with Christ poor and crucified, in the love of God, and in brother/sisterhood with all people and all of creation.

He is best known for his use of the comparative method in the field of scientific anthropology, the discovery of ginseng, and his writings on the Iroquois. Lafitau was the first of the Jesuit missionaries in Canada to have a scientific point of view. Francis Parkman praises Lafitau, stating, \\"none of the old writers are so satisfactory as Lafitau.\\" He is best known as the author of Customs of the American Indians Compared with the Customs of Primitive Times (1724). Early years Lafitau was born in Bordeaux on May 31, 1681, and died there on July 3, 1746. Growing up in the port city of Bordeaux, Lafitau gained an interest in the French empire at a young age. Although his father was a wealthy merchant and banker in the citadel of the Huguenot Protestantism, the Lafitau family remained strong Catholics. His younger brother, Pierre-Fran√ßois (1685‚Äì1764), followed Lafitau into the Jesuit order and later became the Bishop of Sisteron. Lafitau was able to gain access to books and the opportunity to study and learn many languages as a result of his family‚Äôs wealth and resources. He was familiar with important French, Spanish and English voyages, as well as ancient literature, philosophy, theology, geography, and natural history. Lafitau had access to these sources through his education, and this is evident in his writing ‚Äì in which he frequently makes reference to them. Since the Society of Jesus offered a path to higher education in France, Lafitau joined the Jesuits at Bordeaux at fifteen. Following his novitiate, he studied rhetoric and philosophy at Pau between 1699 and 1701. He then taught humanities and rhetoric at Limoges, Saintes and Pau, before returning to his studies at Poitiers and La Fleche from 1706 to 1709. He finished his studies in theology at the College of Louis-le-Grand in Paris in 1710. It was the next year, in April 1711, that Father General Tamburini granted him permission to leave at the end of the year in order to join the Iroquois mission in Canada, where he remained as a missionary for nearly six years. Work on the Iroquois in Sault St. Louis Reverend Joseph- Fran√ßois Lafitau, engraving of 1858 by Walker. Lafitau is best known for his important discoveries on the Iroquois society. He arrived in Quebec in 1711 amidst a period of hostility between the Five Nations prior to the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht. The woods were deemed unsafe for travelers and therefore he was ordered to join the Iroquois on the south shore of the St. Lawrence valley in Sault St. Louis, also known as Kahnawake. Sault St. Louis already shared a great tradition with both the members of his order and the Iroquois by the time Lafitau arrived. He noticed the importance of women in Iroquois society, the universality of marriage as an institution, age grading, the classificatory system of relationship, and the pulse of Indian politics in the town council. Lafitau also contributed to existing scholarship on the Iroquois long-house; he details the rules of residence and social organization. Lafitau‚Äôs observations provide a greater understanding of Iroquois kinship and exogamy. Comparative methodology Lafitau is considered the first of the modern ethnographers and a precursor of scientific ethnology for his work on the Iroquois. He developed a model of studying peoples that involved describing existing cultures on their own terms‚Äînot in comparison to European society. He distinguished generic and specific traits, transforming the \\"generic savage\\" into specific tribal groups. He explained that \\"only from specific identities can genetic relations be inferred.\\" = Presuppositions = Lafitau‚Äôs comparative method (method of reciprocal illumination) rests on his \\"system\\" which is a compendium of his theoretical presupposition. He believed that man was created equal by God and was given a set of divine moral principles. These principles were gradually violated due to the inherited sinfulness of man‚Äîa consequence of the penalty of Original Sin. All men originally shared one religion with one God but over time people migrated to separate margins of the earth where they then lost touch with the values and traditions of this one \\"true religion\\" and culture. Therefore, Lafitau believed in the \\"psychic unity of mankind\\" and the doctrine of primitive monotheism. Lafitau strove to find traces of this degenerated \\"true faith\\", of which Christianity was the highest form, among the Native Americans. Lafitau‚Äôs version of these theories differed from that of his predecessors and contemporaries. Pierre Daniel Huet, for example, believed that the pagan gods and goddesses dated back to Moses and Zipporah. Lafitau was aware of this and he mentions Huet in his work. Nevertheless, for Lafitau, this theory was flawed and vulnerable to the attacks of the atheists who claimed that religion was the invention of man and the work of politics. If Christianity originated from Moses, then all the peoples before this time would have had pagan religions, religions that were older than Christianity. This would further imply that there is no one underlining religion whose traces can be found in all the peoples of the world. This, which goes against Lafitau‚Äôs \\"system\\", would make it possible for atheists to attack the Christianity‚Äôs claim of being the \\"one true religion\\" . Lafitau strove to find these traces of degenerated faith in a hope of proving his theory of unitary faith and unitary humanity. = Stages of development = Lafitau believed that all cultures change over time, and that they will eventually reach the European level of civility. The Native Americans, according to him, were at a lower stage of development than the Europeans. They were at the same stage as the peoples of the Ancient Times, hence their customs could be juxtaposed with the disregard of time and place. This is the basis out of which his method emerges. What sets Lafitau apart from his predecessors and contemporaries, was the formulation of his method of reciprocal illumination. By juxtaposing one type of behavior, or a set of beliefs and customs, to those of other cultures who have reached the same level of developmental history, their similarities and differences would reveal information about both. For example, Lafitau describes the process of making celts by Native Americans, i.e. crude axes, by rubbing flint and rock against abrasive sandstone. This empirical information can then be juxtaposed against the European belief that relics similar to those were \\"thunder stones\\" deposited by bolts of lightning. Based on the empirical knowledge it can be extrapolated that the \\"thunder stones\\" were not deposited by lightning, rather they were made and used by the Gallic hunters, much in the same way as Native Americans use Celts. In Lafitau‚Äôs words: = Symbolic Theology = According to Anthony Pagden, Lafitau argued for the possibility of translating all human behavior, especially religious, into a language which he called \\"Symbolic Theology\\", which would explain the universal cultural patterns such as marriage, government and religion. To achieve this, Lafitau emphasized the factual account of the evidence. By using field observations of the \\"savage\\" (Lafitau‚Äôs contemporary \\"savage\\"), he would compare them to the historical sources, on the peoples from antiquity. In so doing, Lafitau strove to reveal an underlining cultural pattern; a universal human culture and universal human system of belief. In short, Lafitau wanted to establish the \\"science of manners and customs\\". Comparing Native American customs to those of the Ancients was a rhetorical strategy that was used for centuries before Lafitau, and as late as the 19th century. The Ancients, as well as people from the Bible, served as a source of anthropological knowledge, and as a model of admirable humanity. It was used to create a more favorable image of alien peoples by comparing them to the \\"wise and enlightened\\" Ancients. The outlandish characteristics and customs of the Native Americans, when compared to similar, sometimes just as strange, costumes of the Ancients, would then become more acceptable. It would familiarize and elevate the image of the Native Americans by making them share in the qualities of the cultures that were still held in high esteem among the Europeans. For example, when describing Iroquois chieftains names, Lafitau warns that names such as Hoghouaho (the Great Wolf) or Hoskereouak (the Great Bear), might sound strange to his fellow Europeans, however, he points out that in antiquity people‚Äôs names were names of divinities, and they, in turn, were names of animals as well. In short, the comparative method made the strange custom more familiar and the \\"savage\\" more human. = Importance of Lafitau's contribution = Lafitau is remembered for applying the comparative method with a greater level of competency than any of his contemporaries. Through original field observations, he was able to critique the works of earlier writers on Primitive peoples. By using the Comparative Method, Lafitau rejected all theories of social and cultural change and instead used his study to demonstrate the similarities in customs, practices, and usages of the Native North Americans with diverse peoples from different continents and centuries. Discovery of ginseng Canadian ginseng, in Chinese gin-seng, in Mohawk garent-oguen : L'aureliana de Canada, en chinois gin-seng, en iroquois garent-oguen Lafitau described ginseng growing in Canada, illustration redrawn by Walker His discovery of ginseng in the forest bordering the St. Lawrence made Lafitau famous in the European academies. Ginseng was native to the New World as well as the Old and had long been known to the Iroquois for its medicinal properties. It was on his search for ginseng that Lafitau began to question Mohawk herbalists, gaining information of native customs and beliefs, which he hoped would benefit European knowledge of medicine. First learning about the ginseng of Tartary (i.e. Northern China) from the writings of the Jesuit missionary Pierre Jartoux, Lafitau surmised that the conditions in North America would be favorable to the plant. He was determined to find the plant in the Iroquois culture so that he would have partial proof of their Asiatic origin. Encouraged by the Iroquois to continue his hunt, a Mohawk woman whom Lafitau had hired to find the plant recognized it as one of the common remedies of the Iroquois. Lafitau quickly sent for Jartoux‚Äôs publication and description to identify the plant from the plate. In his discovery, Lafitau was the first to employ botanical plates in the field in order to gain information from Natives. His published report the M√©moire...concernant la pr√©cieuse plante du gin-seng in 1718 set off a hunt by market collectors who exported ginseng to China via France. M√©moire...concernant la pr√©cieuse plante du gin-seng has never been translated into English.  Bibliography  =Moeurs des Sauvages Am√©riquains= His major work, written in French, was first published in 1724 in Paris. It is entitled Customs of the American Indians Compared with the Customs of Primitive Times (Moeurs des Sauvages Am√©riquains, Compar√©es aux Moeurs des Premiers Temps) and is 1,100 pages in total. In 1974, Dr. William Fenton and Dr. Elizabeth Moore translated and edited the work as part of the Champlain Society's General Series. Daily lives of Indians in New France (eighteenth century).

His 350-page chapter on religion accounts for his personal role as a missionary in Canada. Chapters on government, marriage, education, death, and burial are all roughly 70 pages in length. The longest chapters in Volume II on Occupation of the Women and Warfare is related to the importance of these subjects in Iroquois culture. = Other works = Aside from Moeurs des Sauvages Am√©riquains Lafitau wrote two other books: * Histoire de Jean de Brienne, Roy de J√©rusalem et Empereur de Constantinople was released in Paris before his return to Canada, 1727. However, the subject matter of this book is not widely known and very few copies are in circulation. * In Histoire des d√©couvertes et conquestes des Portugais dans le Nouveau Monde, Lafitau wrote two volumes in an attempt to make available to French readers details of exploration and adventure that were unknown to them. These commonly read and used chronicles of customs were published in 1733. Continuing with the same development of customs discussed in his first major work Moeurs des Sauvages Am√©riquains, Lafitau maintains that customs can only be understood in the original language of those who practice them.  Return to France  Lafitau returned to France in November 1717. There he pleaded to colonial authorities that the brandy trade was forcing the Iroquois to move from Sault St. Louis to avoid the liquor trafficking. By arguing that the brandy trade with the Natives of Canada was against the interests of the Colony and the State, Lafitau was successful in stopping a lot of this activity. The manuscript for his work on the Iroquois was submitted and approved in Paris on May 15 of 1722. The ideas and writing style of Lafitau have been identified as characteristic of Cartesian Linguistics. His ideas were published at an important intersection between French Classicism and the New Rationalism that favored reason over authority and the stability of the laws of nature. The originality of Lafitau‚Äôs work was not fully recognized during his lifetime because many of his ideas seemed similar to those published by earlier writers, but scholars of later centuries paid tribute to his unprecedented systematic comparative and evolutionary anthropology.

Andersons Bay (sometimes spelt in the grammatically correct former form Anderson's Bay, and often known locally simply as \\"Andy Bay\\") is a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. It is located in the southeast of the city's urban area, southeast of the city's centre.  Geography  The suburb of Andersons Bay extends south from the Andersons Bay Inlet, an indentation in the southern shore of the Otago Harbour, and across the isthmus joining the Otago Peninsula to the mainland. In 2001 Andersons Bay had a population of 2,532. The suburb's name is also occasionally used by Dunedinites for the area extending north along the Southern Endowment, an area of land reclaimed from the harbour which sits close to its western shore - towards the suburb of South Dunedin. This area, which was reclaimed during the mid-twentieth century, was the location of the bay for which the suburb is named. The Southern Endowment, largely used for light industrial purposes, also includes a sports complex, the Edgar Centre. South of the Anderson's Bay Inlet the suburb comprises residential housing. It is bounded by Musselburgh in the west and southwest, Shiel Hill in the east, and the coastal suburbs of Tahuna and Tainui in the south. These two smaller suburbs, which lie close to the Pacific Ocean, are often considered part of either Andersons Bay or Musselburgh. The rocky outcrops of the Musselburgh RiseNote: In this article, \\"the Musselburgh Rise\\" refers to the outcrop, \\"Musselburgh Rise\\" (without \\"the\\") refers to the road.

Close to the northern edge of the Andersons Bay Inlet a large memorial stone commemorates the Taranaki MƒÅori prisoners of the New Zealand Wars who were transported south to Dunedin, many of whom constructed the causeway across the head of the inlet and much of Dunedin's foreshore roads as forced labour. A branch railway ran along Portobello Road in this area from the 1870s until 1912. One of Dunedin's secondary schools, Bayfield High School stands on reclaimed land at the southern end of the inlet. This school lies close to the boundary of the suburbs of Andersons Bay and Musselburgh. Andersons Bay's main roads include Portobello Road and Portsmouth Drive (in the industrial area north of the inlet, and Musselburgh Rise, Silverton Street, and Somerville Street (in the residential area to the south). Shore Street and Marne Street skirt the western and eastern shores of the inlet; Marne Street links with Larnach Road, which runs steeply up to the suburbs of Waverley and Vauxhall. History MƒÅori named the area Puketai or Puketahi, probably meaning \\"single or isolated hill\\". It is likely that a pa of this name was sited somewhere in the vicinity, possibly on the rise overlooking Tomahawk Lagoon in what is now the suburb's southeast, or on some section of the Musselburgh Rise. Such a site would have commanded a strategic position prior to the reclamation of land from the harbour and from swamp, as it would have controlled almost all land passage to the Otago Peninsula. Andersons Bay gained its current name due to early settler James Anderson and his son and daughter-in-law John and Isabella, who were the first European settlers in the district in 1844 - four years before the official founding of the Otago Settlement and Dunedin. James's grandson John was the first European child born in the area, in 1846.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. . p. 23 Their home was close to what is now the corner of Somerville and Silverton Streets, a corner known for many years by the now almost- forgotten name of Ross's Corner.Hayward, P. (1998) Intriguing Dunedin Street Walks. Dunedin: Express Office Services. p.29 Andersons Bay Inlet, once known as Andersons Cove, represents the remnant of a far larger expanse of water which included the long-reclaimed Tainui Inlet. Much of this was reclaimed in the 1950s to provide grounds for Bayfield High School.Herd, J. and Griffiths, G.J. (1980) Discovering Dunedin. Dunedin: John McIndoe. . p. 24 In the late 19th century both a railway and ferry service connected this area with central Dunedin, but neither has survived. The ferry operated only during the 1890s, and the railway operated from 1877 until the early years of the twentieth century. Rail planners envisaged a railway line running along the shore of the peninsula to Portobello, but Andersons Bay was the furthest the line ever reached. Andersons Bay had its own council briefly, the Bay Town Board. This administered the area from 1905 until its amalgamation with Dunedin City in 1912. Andersons Bay hit news headlines in 1995 after one of New Zealand's most notorious crimes took place in Every Street, close to the boundary of Andersons Bay and Shiel Hill. The case, in which five of the six members of the Bain family were slain, led to one of New Zealand's most prominent causes c√©l√®bres after the arrest of the remaining member of the family, David Bain, for the murders. David Bain, found guilty, served 13 years of a life sentence before succeeding in having the case reopened. His retrial, in 2009, resulted in a verdict of \\"not guilty\\". On 15 March 2019 part of Somerville Street in Andersons Bay was cordoned off while police, including Armed Offenders Squad officers, searched a house formerly occupied by a suspect in the Christchurch mosque shootings. Tahuna and Tainui A view over Tainui, looking south east The grandstand at Tahuna Park Tahuna and Tainui are two small, somewhat vaguely defined suburbs which lie to the south of Andersons Bay and Musselburgh, close to Dunedin's southern coastline (Ocean Beach). Both are often considered parts of either Musselburgh or Andersons Bay. Tainui lies to the north, in the area of residential housing which lies in the southeastern corner of \\"The Flat\\" (southern Dunedin's wide coastal plain) between Victoria and Tahuna Roads in the south and Musselburgh Rise in the north. Its eastern boundary is the start of a section of the Musselburgh Rise skirted by Tainui Road. Notable features of Tainui include Culling Park, a sports ground which is the home of Dunedin Technical football club. To the south of Tainui is Tahuna. This suburb stretches along Victoria and Tahuna Roads, and is largely dominated by several areas of open space which lie to the south between these roads and the ocean. These open spaces include two notable sports venues: Chisholm Park Golf Course and Tahuna Park. Chisholm Park is a championship- standard links course featuring one of New Zealand's finest holes, Lawyer's Head. This hole dog-legs around craggy cliffs with the ocean pounding at their feet, and as such is both visually impressive and technically difficult.Russell, Peter G. (1985) Golf Courses of Otago. Christchurch: Whitcoulls. p.14 The course was founded in 1937 and extended from nine to 18 holes in 1941. Tahuna Park houses Dunedin's A&P; showgrounds, and was the city's first rugby union and rugby league test venue. The grounds were inaugurated in a here in 1883, and the park's only union test match was played in 1905, with the All Blacks beating Australia 14-3. The park hosted the 1924 Great Britain side when they defeated the New Zealand rugby league side 31-18 in front of 16,000 fans.Coffey, John. Canterbury XIII, Christchurch, 1987 The third notable open space close to the coast is the Andersons Bay Cemetery, Dunedin's biggest cemetery. This is located at the southeastern end of Tahuna, and is bounded to the west and south by Chisholm Park Golf Links. The cemetery occupies a prominent rise that juts into the sea as Lawyer's Head. The cemetery was opened in 1867, but is now largely full. A crematorium, inaugurated in 1962, occupies a prominent spot close to the cliffs. Beyond the cemetery, Tahuna Road reaches a Y-junction with Tomahawk Road, which descends to the southeast to follow the coast to the suburb of Ocean Grove and rises to the north to meet with Silverton Road, Andersons Bay at that suburb's boundary with Shiel Hill. This area of Tahuna was formerly known as Ocean View, a name which is still occasionally encountered, though this name has fallen out of use due to confusion with the settlement of the same name which lies to the southwest near Brighton. Education Andersons Bay School is a primary school for year 1 to year 6 children (5 to 10 years old). It has a decile rating of 10. It is one of the largest primary schools in Dunedin, with around 322 children as of 2018. The school brought in the use of a school uniform in 2014. The school celebrated its 150th Anniversary with a reunion in 2008.

The River Clwyd forms part of the western boundary of the community (parish), which extends further east and south of the village, covering much of the area in the triangle formed by the A-roads joining Ruthin, Corwen and Llandegla. The southernmost tip of the community is marked by Bwrdd y Tri Arglwydd (the table of the three lords), an ancient stone monument marking the point where the lordships of Ruthin, Glyndyfrdwy and Yale met.

History and amenities  =St Elidan Church= Llanelidan is a pretty, scattered hamlet in the green valley of the Afon y Maes, a tributary of the Clwyd. The church - uniquely dedicated to a local saint - stands beside the Leyland Arms public house, surrounded by yews and old Welsh tombstones. Built in the 15th century and ‚Äòdouble-naved‚Äô in the distinctive local style, it retains many medieval features despite extensive Victorian restoration. There are a pair of barrel-vaulted ‚Äòcanopies of honour‚Äô over the altar spaces, fragments of medieval glass - notably the symbols of the crucifixion in blue shields above the altar - and above all a wonderful display of carved woodwork. Sections of the medieval rood screen (which must have been especially fine) are set by the pulpit, including horse-like beasts, intricate roundels, and trails of vines and ivy-berries. The Jacobean pulpit has carvings of its own, with more panels of the same date behind the altar. Old box pews, monuments to successive squires of nearby Nantclwyd Hall, and a touching portrait of the local Roman Catholic martyr Edward Jones are noteworthy. Church usually open daylight hours.

It began as a promotion affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) that appeared on the national scene under the ownership of media mogul Ted Turner and based in Atlanta, Georgia. The name came from a wrestling television program that aired on TBS in the 1980s, which had taken the name from an Australian wrestling promotion of the 1970s. In the 1990s, World Championship Wrestling, along with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), were the top two wrestling promotions in the United States. Its flagship show WCW Monday Nitro went head-to-head with WWF Raw is War in a ratings battle known as the Monday Night Wars. However, lackluster storylines, the increasing popularity of the WWF's Attitude Era, interference and restrictions from Time Warner eventually led to its decline and eventual acquisition of key assets by its main competition, Vince McMahon and the WWF (now WWE).  NWA years (1982‚Äì1987) Although World Championship Wrestling was a brand name used by promoter Jim Barnett for his Australian promotion, the first promotion in the United States to use the World Championship Wrestling brand name (though it was never referred to as \\"WCW\\") on a wide scale was Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW). GCW, owned primarily by Jack Brisco and Gerald Brisco and booked by Ole Anderson, was the first NWA territory to gain cable television access, being broadcast on Channel 17 of Ted Turner's Superstation TBS. The show was broadcast every Saturday evening, from 6:05 PM EST to 8:05 PM EST. After founding his own company, Titan Sports Inc. in 1980, in 1982, Vincent K. McMahon purchased his father's Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) and merged it into Titan Sports Inc. Under his leadership, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) became the top promotion in North America, and GCW devised the name \\"World Championship Wrestling\\" in an effort to compete. In 1982, GCW changed the name of its television show (and thus its public face) to World Championship Wrestling since it was already starting to run shows in \\"neutral\\" territories such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These efforts helped to keep GCW competitive against the WWF, as both promotions had secured television deals and were trying to become national, as opposed to regional, entities. The change in name helped make GCW the top promotion once again, until the WWF was able to officially leave the NWA and create the show WWF All American Wrestling. The NWA, led by the President of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett, Jr., countered by creating Starrcade in the fall of 1983, the main event of which featured Ric Flair defeating Harley Race in a critically acclaimed steel cage match to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, which he would hold on nine separate occasions. The success of Starrcade would elevate Flair to superstar status; he would become the franchise player of Jim Crockett Promotions and is largely responsible for the success of JCP during the mid-to-late 1980s. The success of Starrcade would also succeed in propelling the NWA back to the top, but Vince McMahon again regained the lead with Hulk Hogan's dramatic world title victory at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984, as well as the creation of the television show Tuesday Night Titans. On April 9, 1984, the Brisco brothers sold their shares in GCW, including their prime time slot on the TBS cable television network, to Vince McMahon. However, GCW's core audience was not interested in the WWF's gimmick-based approach, preferring a more athletic style. As a result, when GCW's television viewers tuned into TBS on July 14, 1984 and saw WWF programming instead, they were outraged and sent complaints to the network demanding the return of GCW. This day has since gone down in wrestling lore as Black Saturday. Adding fuel to the fire was the fact that, despite originally promising to produce original programming for the TBS time slot, McMahon chose instead to provide only a clip show for TBS featuring highlights from other WWF programming, a move which angered network head Ted Turner and was a major factor in his decision to discontinue showing the WWF on his network. Luckily for Turner, Ole Anderson had refused to sell his shares in GCW to the WWF, and he teamed with fellow holdout shareholders Fred Ward and Ralph Freed to create Championship Wrestling from Georgia. Turner quickly secured a television deal with the new promotion, as well as with Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling based in Oklahoma. = Jim Crockett Promotions (1985‚Äì1988)= In March 1985, McMahon sold his TBS time slot and the \\"World Championship Wrestling\\" name to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), owned by Jim Crockett, Jr., under pressure from Ted Turner. The WWF and its major superstar, Hulk Hogan, however, were now the superior figures of wrestling after the success of the first WrestleMania, so the sale took place to successfully put the company in better shape. The new WCW, which was now a combination of JCP (Mid-Atlantic Wrestling) and Championship Wrestling from Georgia, was now the top show on TBS, and Jim Crockett, Jr. became NWA President for the second time. By 1986, Jim Crockett Promotions controlled key portions of the NWA, including the traditional NWA territories in North and South Carolina, Georgia, and St. Louis, thanks in no small part to the success of the Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup (which showcased talent from various NWA territories), as well as a working cross-promotional relationship with Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. JCP merged its NWA territories into one group, promoting under the banner \\"NWA World Championship Wrestling\\". This sparked a feud between Crockett and Vince McMahon's WWF, and the companies attempted to outmaneuver each other to acquire key television slots. It was the WWF, however, who was able to become a hit in St. Louis (and the rest of Missouri as well), which brought trouble to the NWA Central States. The WWF was able to become a hit across the country as well, as the feud between Hulk Hogan and Paul Orndorff appealed to a large audience. Following this, Bob Geigel became the NWA President once again. In the same year, JCP also purchased Geigel's Heart of America Sports Attractions, promoters of the Central States territory, which owned the rights to promote wrestling shows through the states of Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa.  National promotion  In 1987, JCP would enter into an agreement to control Championship Wrestling from Florida, and Universal Wrestling Federation (which covered Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana; by this time, the UWF had split from the NWA); this helped elevate Crockett to a third tenure as NWA President. The Florida and Mid-South territories (along with those companies' rosters of wrestlers) were absorbed into WCW. Jim Crockett Promotions now owned NWA St. Louis, the Universal Wrestling Federation, Mid-Atlantic, Central States Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Georgia and Championship Wrestling from Florida as well. JCP had almost accomplished its goal of creating a national promotion. Between the purchasing of several NWA territories, World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas leaving the NWA in 1986 (and later merging with Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association in Memphis to create the United States Wrestling Association brand), JCP was the last bastion of the NWA, and the last member with national television exposure. Although JCP and the NWA were still two separate legal entities, with Crockett as NWA President, the NWA was effectively reduced to an on-paper organization funded by Jim Crockett Promotions, and allowed JCP to use the NWA brand name for promoting. With the large amount of capital needed to take a wrestling promotion on a national tour, the various territorial acquisitions had seriously drained JCP's coffers. He was in a similar situation to that of the WWF in the early 1980s: a large debt load, and the success or failure of a federation hinging on the success or failure of a series of pay-per-view events. In 1987, JCP marketed the fifth installment of Starrcade as the NWA's answer to the WWF's WrestleMania event. However, the WWF promoted their first Survivor Series event on the same day. The WWF informed cable companies that if they chose to carry Starrcade, they would not be allowed to carry future WWF events. The vast majority of companies showed Survivor Series (only five opted to remain loyal to their contract with Crockett, resulting in only an $80,000 profit after expenses). In January 1988, JCP promoted Bunkhouse Stampede, and McMahon counter-programmed with the first Royal Rumble on USA Network. Both NWA events achieved low buyrates, and the resulting financial blow led to the beginning of the end for JCP. The decision to hold these events in Chicago and New York alienated the Crockett's main fanbase in the Carolinas, hampering their drawing power for arena shows in the Southeast.  Dusty Rhodes  In 1984, Crockett had signed Dusty Rhodes and made him booker for World Championship Wrestling. Rhodes had a reputation for creativity and authored many of the memorable feuds and story lines of this period and gimmick matches like WarGames. Also, Rhodes was responsible for elevating up-and-coming wrestlers such as Sting, Ricky Steamboat, Magnum T.A., the Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal), and Nikita Koloff, among others, to superstardom. By 1988, after four years of competition with Vince McMahon, and a long political struggle with champion Ric Flair, Rhodes was burnt out. Fans were sick of the Dusty finish (and other non-endings for shows) that had obliterated the once-profitable house show market. One of the last creative aspects Dusty Rhodes initiated was Clash of the Champions I, on the night of WrestleMania IV. For a quarter-hour, the Ric Flair vs. Sting match gained more viewers than WrestleMania; the epic match also made Sting a top player for WCW. By the end of 1988, Rhodes was booking cards seemingly at random, and planning at one point to have mid-card wrestler Rick Steiner defeat Ric Flair in a five-minute match at Starrcade for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Starrcade '88, Rhodes was fired by the promotion after an angle he booked on November 26, where Road Warrior Animal pulled a spike out of his shoulder pad and jammed it in Rhodes's eye busting it wide open, despite a strict \\"no-blood\\" policy laid down by Turner after his recent purchase of the company.  First years under Ted Turner (1989‚Äì1993) Ted Turner. To preserve the inexpensive network programming provided by professional wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions was purchased outright by Turner on October 11, 1988. Originally incorporated by TBS as the Universal Wrestling Corporation, Turner promised fans that WCW would be the athlete- oriented style of the NWA. The sale was completed on November 2, 1988, with a television taping of NWA World Championship Wrestling that very same date in WCW's hometown of Atlanta. 1989 proved to be a turnaround year for WCW, with Ric Flair on top for most of the year as both World Champion and head booker. Flair helped bring in Ricky Steamboat and Terry Funk, and his pay-per-view matches with Steamboat were financially and critically successful. Young stars such as Sid Vicious, Sting, Scott Steiner, The Road Warriors, Brian Pillman, The Great Muta and Lex Luger were given major storylines and championship opportunities. 1990, however, would be an entirely different story, as Flair would be fired from being head booker in March 1990 after WCW talent began to argue that Flair was booking things in his favor. One of these examples was Flair's refusal to drop the WCW World title to Lex Luger, as he had already promised to drop it to Sting, who himself had been injured earlier in the year. Most in the business agreed that Sting was a much better talent than Luger. Under Flair's booking TV ratings climbed and had great PPVs. Flair was eventually replaced by Ole Anderson. Despite this influx of talent, WCW soon began working to gradually incorporate much of the glamour and showy gimmicks for which the WWF was better known. Virtually none of these stunts‚Äîsuch as the live cross-promotional appearance of RoboCop at Capital Combat in May 1990, the Chamber of Horrors gimmick, and the notorious Black Scorpion storyline‚Äîsucceeded. In addition, house shows were also dropping to record lows after Ole continuously pushed older wrestlers who were loyal to him during the shows. Behind the scenes, WCW was becoming more autonomous and slowly started separating itself from the historic NWA name. In January 1991, WCW officially split from the NWA and began to recognize its own WCW World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Tag Team Championship. Both WCW and the NWA recognized Ric Flair (who was by now no longer the head booker) as their World Heavyweight Champion throughout most of the first half of 1991, but WCW, particularly recently installed company president Jim Herd, who was formerly the manager of the St. Louis TV station KPLR-TV and had also once been the regional manager of Pizza Hut, turned against Flair for various reasons and fired him before The Great American Bash in July 1991 after failed contract negotiations. In the process, they officially stripped him of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. According to Flair's autobiography, they refused to return the $25,000 deposit he had put down on the physical belt, so he kept it and brought it with him when he was hired by the WWF at the request of Vince McMahon. Flair then incorporated the belt into his gimmick, dubbing himself \\"The Real World's Champion\\". On a sidenote, Flair eventually received his deposit which with interest was over $38,000. WCW later renegotiated the use of the NWA name as a co-promotional gimmick with New Japan Pro Wrestling and sued the WWF to stop showing Flair with the old NWA World Title belt on its programs, claiming a trademark on the physical design of the belt. The belt was returned to WCW by Flair when Jim Herd was let go and he received his deposit back plus interest. It was brought back as the revived NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Meanwhile, the creative product of the company sank in 1991 and 1992 under the presidency of the inexperienced Herd. Ric Flair, who had conflicts with Herd, once stated that Herd \\"knew nothing about wrestling, other than the fact that the station he ran had a hot show\\" (referring to the once-popular show Wrestling at the Chase. which was broadcast by KPLR-TV while Herd was manager there).The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, WWE Home Video, 2003 According to Flair, Herd also wanted him to drop his entire \\"Nature Boy\\" persona, shave his head (even though Flair's bleach blonde hair was one of his most recognizable trademarks) and adopt a Roman gladiator gimmick by the name of Spartacus in order to \\"change with the times\\". This didn't sit too well with Flair and the creative committee (committee member Kevin Sullivan was quoted as saying, \\"After we change Flair's gimmick, why don't we go to Yankee Stadium and change Babe Ruth's uniform number?\\").To Be the Man, Ric Flair, WWE Books, 2004 This backstage feud hit its breaking point when, during contract renegotiation, Flair refused to take a pay cut and be moved away from the main event position (despite the fact that he was by far the company's biggest draw). He also refused to drop the title to Lex Luger as Herd wanted. Herd accused Flair of holding up the company. Flair tried to compromise to Herd and offered to drop the title to fellow Horseman Barry Windham, saying that Windham deserved the title.Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection DVD Herd's other ideas included the Ding Dongs (a tag team whose sole gimmick was that they were obsessed with bells), a lumberjack named Big Josh who was accompanied to the ring by dancing bears, and the Desperados, a stable of bumbling cowboys. None of these ideas were received well by the rest of WCW, as they were seen by many as a poor attempt to mimic the WWF's more gimmick-oriented style, and Stan Hansen left WCW outright when he was asked to be a part of the Desperados. Jim Cornette and Stan Lane would also depart from the promotion after having conflicts with Herd (thus breaking up the Midnight Express, one of WCW's top tag teams), and the Road Warriors would also leave in July 1990 because of conflicts with Herd. Herd was fired in January 1992 and was succeeded by Kip Allen Frey. Frey's tenure running WCW was brief, and he would be replaced later in the year by \\"Cowboy\\" Bill Watts, who had formerly been the promoter for Mid-South Wrestling (later known as the Universal Wrestling Federation) and was the first head executive of WCW to have prior experience in the wrestling business since Jim Crockett left. 1992 would also prove to be another bad year for WCW as well, as Watts would make top rope moves ‚Äì which were commonly performed by rising stars such as Brian Pillman and the Steiner Brothers ‚Äì illegal during wrestling matches. This was part of Watts' plans to take the WCW product back to 1970s standards, with poorly lit arenas and house shows in remote rural towns. This idea was not overly embraced by the rest of WCW. After clashes with management over a number of issues as well as feeling pressure from Hank Aaron over a racially sensitive piece of correspondence, as well as accusations of anti-semitism from Paul E. Dangerously and Scotty Flamingo (both of whom are Jewish), he resigned.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.237) He was subsequently replaced by Eric Bischoff. = Final split with the NWA = During the period that WCW operated with its own World Heavyweight Championship, while also recognizing the NWA's world title, Flair left the WWF on good terms and returned to WCW, regaining the NWA title from Barry Windham in July 1993. Immediately, the other, now smaller, member organizations of the NWA began demanding that Flair defend the title under their rules in their territories, as mandated by old NWA agreements. The title was later scheduled to be dropped by Flair to Rick Rude, a title change which was exposed by the pre-taping of matches at the Disney-MGM Studios, known as the Disney tapings. The NWA board of directors, working separately from WCW, objected to the title being changed without their vote and WCW finally left the NWA for good again in September 1993. WCW still legally owned and used the actual belt which represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, however, and Rick Rude even defended it as the \\"Big Gold Belt\\", but they could no longer use the NWA name. The title thus became known as the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship as the World Heavyweight Championship as sanctioned by fictitious subsidiary WCW International. WCW claimed that WCW International still recognized the belt as a legitimate World Championship. For a short while, there were essentially two world titles up for competition in the organization, with Sting winning the WCW International title, while Flair captured the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Big Van Vader. The two titles were unified by Flair in a match on June 23, 1994, when the experiment was jettisoned. The Big Gold Belt was then used to represent the lone world championship in the company. It was used as such until WCW's closure in 2001, and for a time in the WWF.  Eric Bischoff era (1993‚Äì1999)  Eric Bischoff. There were signs of gradual recovery in February 1993 when former commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as Executive Vice President of WCW. Bischoff, originally brought in as a secondary commentator behind Jim Ross after the American Wrestling Association folded, was desperate to give WCW a new direction and impressed Turner's top brass with his non- confrontational tactics and business savvy. Ross, upset that a man who once answered to him was now his supervisor, requested and received a release from TBS executive Bill Shaw (after suggestion from Bischoff) and ended up in the WWF.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.238) Bischoff's first year running the company was considered extremely unsuccessful. Dusty Rhodes and Ole Anderson were still in full creative control at this point, and under their watch WCW presented cartoonish storylines as well as seemingly pointless feuds with little or no build-up (for instance, the \\"Lost in Cleveland\\" and \\"Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal\\" angles involving Cactus Jack and Sting respectively, as well as the \\"White Castle of Fear\\" and Beach Blast mini-movies). The \\"Lost in Cleveland\\" storyline began when Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) first wrestled Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993. Foley and Vader wanted an intense match, so they agreed that Vader would hit Cactus with a series of heavy blows to the face.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.239-241) WCW edited the match heavily because it was against their policies to show the heavy bleeding that resulted. Foley suffered a broken nose, a dislocated jaw and needed twenty-seven stitches, but won the match via countout. Because the title did not change hands on a countout, WCW booked a rematch. Foley, however, wanted some time off to be with his newborn daughter and get surgery to repair a knee injury. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 23, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and power-bombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot and hand.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.243-244) While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.248-250) Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in his autobiography that they were the brainchild of WCW executives, who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.Foley, Mick. Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 249) On July 6, 1993, WCW began the aforementioned Disney Tapings, a move which would grow into a major headache for them. In order to save money, the promotion rented out a studio located at the Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, and proceeded to tape its syndicated television programming months before it was to air on television. Wrestlers were often forced to appear on- camera with belts they would not actually win for several more months, exposing future WCW storylines to those in attendance (most of whom were tourists who had been coached to cheer and boo on cue). Footage of Rude with the NWA title shot at these tapings had caused the controversy with the NWA discussed above. Moreover, the tapings also caused confusion in the tag team division, as they had revealed that Arn Anderson and Paul Roma were to win the WCW World tag team titles from The Hollywood Blonds (\\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin and Flyin' Brian Pillman). The promotion had decided to swerve the fans at the live Beach Blast pay-per-view event in July and keep the titles on the Blonds, but the live Clash of the Champions XXIV show was to take place in August before the already-shot footage of Anderson and Roma as tag team champions was to begin circulating in late-August. However, before the Clash event, Pillman was injured and unable to wrestle, forcing Lord Steven Regal to replace him alongside Austin. Of course, Anderson and Roma won the titles, and the Blonds, an immensely popular tag team with fans, were inexplicably broken up permanently.The History of WCW: Part V Clash of the Champions XXIV saw WCW's reputation take another hit. In 1993, Ric Flair returned to WCW from his WWF tenure, but was constrained by a no-compete clause from his WWF contract. In response, WCW gave him a talk show segment on its television shows called \\"A Flair for the Gold,\\" in the mold of the old \\"Piper's Pit\\" segments from 1980s WWF programming starring \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper. During a segment of the talk show at the Clash, WCW decided to introduce a \\"mystery partner\\" for the babyfaces, a masked man known as The Shockmaster. The Shockmaster (Fred Ottman, previously known as \\"Typhoon\\" in the WWF) was supposed to crash through a fake wall and intimidate the heels. Instead, he tripped through the wall and fell on his face on live television, inadvertently rendering himself a joke character (despite winning some matches). Dusty Rhodes later claimed that a 2x4 was placed on the bottom of the wall, which had not been there on a successful rehearsal, which caused Ottman to trip and stumble.WWE 24/7- Legends Of Wrestling \\"Worst Characters By November 1993, WCW decided to once again base the promotion around Ric Flair. This was seen as more or less a necessity after prospective top babyface Sid Vicious was involved in an incident with Arn Anderson (which resulted in hospitalization of both men) while on tour in England eight weeks before Starrcade and was fired. Flair then placed his career on the line against Big Van Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair won the title at Starrcade and was once again made booker. That did not stop WCW from suffering massive financial losses in 1993, however; a staggering $23 million. = Competition with the WWF = Beginning in 1994, Bischoff declared open war on McMahon's WWF and aggressively recruited high-profile former WWF superstars such as Hulk Hogan and \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage to work for WCW. Using Turner's monetary resources, Bischoff placed his faith in established stars with proven track records. Due to their high profiles, however, Hogan and Savage were able to demand concessions, such as multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts and creative control over their characters. This would later become a problem during subsequent years of competition with the WWF, as other wrestlers were able to make similar demands, and contract values soared out of control. Hogan in particular was able to gain considerable influence through a friendship with Bischoff. Hogan's considerably hefty fee of $700,000 per pay-per-view appearance plus 25% of the gross revenue from the pay-per-view would cost the company dearly in future years. He was paid this amount whether the pay-per- view was successful or not. Hogan's creative control would later prove to be a large hindrance during WCW's future success, such as during Starrcade 1997. Nevertheless, WCW's first major pay-per-view event since Hogan's hiring, Bash at the Beach, saw the former WWF mainstay cleanly defeat Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The two had worked for the WWF at the same time from 1991 to 1992, and a feud was teased between them, but the big-money match originally planned for WrestleMania VIII was changed to Flair/Savage and Hogan/Sid. When WCW delivered the match, the event drew a high buyrate by WCW standards due to mainstream intrigue and hype. Despite being a critical and financial success, the glory would not last, as the Hogan/Flair feud would only result in one more match (at Halloween Havoc) and the hope for long-term effects on pay-per-view buyrates and ratings did not materialize. Turner management came to this realization when they checked up on the state of the company in mid-1995. Hence, Bischoff called Turner and requested a private meeting, which he was granted.  Nitro and \\"The Monday Night Wars\\"  At their mid-1995 meeting, Turner asked Bischoff how WCW could conceivably compete with McMahon's WWF. Bischoff, not expecting Turner to comply, said that the only way would be a primetime slot on a weekday night, possibly up against the WWF's flagship show, Monday Night Raw. Turner granted him a live hour on TNT every Monday night, launching the weekly show WCW Monday Nitro, which debuted on September 4, 1995, live from the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which specifically overlapped with Raw. The show was expanded to two live hours in May 1996 and later three in February 1998. Bischoff himself was initially the host, alongside Bobby Heenan and ex-NFL star Steve \\"Mongo\\" McMichael. The initial broadcast of Nitro, running unopposed because of the pre-emption of Raw for US Open tennis coverage on the USA Network, featured the return of Lex Luger (who had been in the WWF since 1993) to the WCW audience. WCW's coup of obtaining Luger was significant for several reasons. Because Nitro was live at the time, premiering major stars on the show would signal to the fans the amount of excitement the broadcasts would contain. Also, Luger had just come off a moderately successful run in the WWF, and was at one time one of the company's top stars. Finally, because Luger had been employed with the WWF as recently as a week before his Nitro appearance (he had, in fact, wrestled on a house show for the WWF in Halifax, Nova Scotia the night before his appearance on Nitro) WCW fans would be intrigued to see others possibly \\"jump ship\\". The Monday Night Wars had now officially begun. Early on, Bischoff vigorously promoted his new show by giving away WWF Raw results on Nitro, as Raw, unlike Nitro, was then mostly taped in advance. Bischoff took another famous jab at the WWF on December 18, 1995, when he brought reigning WWF Women's Champion Debrah Miceli (who had previously competed in WCW as \\"Madusa\\") back to the promotion as her WWF character Alundra Blayze and, live on Nitro, had her publicly denounce the Blayze character and throw the WWF Women's title belt in a trash can, reclaiming her \\"Madusa\\" moniker in the process.Wrestling Gone Wrong: Madusa Trashes the WWF Women's Title on Nitro The WWF responded to all this by creating the \\"Billionaire Ted\\" skits, which featured parodies of Ted Turner (\\"Billionaire Ted\\"), Hulk Hogan (\\"The Huckster\\"), Randy Savage (\\"The Nacho Man\\"), and WCW interviewer \\"Mean Gene\\" Okerlund (\\"Scheme Gene\\"), which were said to infuriate Turner, thereby giving him more motivation to compete (though Turner would later admit that he wasn't offended by the skits, and instead found them funny.) = Dominance (1996‚Äì1998) = The tide began to turn in WCW's favor on Memorial Day 1996 when Scott Hall, who had wrestled in the WWF as Razor Ramon, interrupted a match by walking down through the crowd into the ring. He delivered his \\"You want a war?\\" speech: \\"You people know who I am,\\" he began, \\"but you don't know why I'm here.\\" Hall said that he and two of his associates were going to \\"take over.\\" Many thought he meant Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, then still with WWF. Hall challenged the best WCW wrestlers to stand up and defend the company against their onslaught. a few weeks The next week, Hall reappeared on Nitro and pestered the WCW announcers. Sting confronted him, and was rewarded with a toothpick in the face for his efforts. Sting retaliated by slapping Hall across the face, and in response Hall promised Sting a \\"little... no... BIG surprise\\" the next week in Wheeling, West Virginia. This surprise ended up being Hall's good friend and former WWF Champion Kevin Nash. Nash delivered his own speech to Bischoff, referring to WCW's slogan of \\"Where The Big Boys Play\\" with the response \\"We didn't come here to play,\\" and warning Bischoff, \\"The measuring stick just changed here...you're looking at it.\\", and in the weeks following Hall and Nash were collectively referred to as \\"The Outsiders.\\" Both men took to showing up unexpectedly during Nitro broadcasts, usually jumping wrestlers backstage, distracting wrestlers by standing in the entranceways of arenas, or walking around in the audience. Within a couple of weeks, they announced the forthcoming appearance of a mysterious third member. At Bash at the Beach 1996, Hall and Nash were scheduled to team with their mystery partner against Lex Luger, Randy Savage and Sting. At the onset of the match, Hall and Nash came out without a third man, telling \\"Mean Gene\\" Okerlund that he was \\"in the building,\\" but that they did not need him yet. Shortly into the match, a Stinger Splash resulted in Luger being crushed behind Kevin Nash, and being taken away on a stretcher, reducing the match to The Outsiders vs. Sting and Savage. Hall and Nash took control of the match when Hulk Hogan came to the ring. After standing off with The Outsiders for a moment, he suddenly leg dropped Savage, showing himself to be the Outsiders' mysterious third man. Giving an interview with Okerlund directly after the match, Hogan claimed the reason for the turn was that he was tired of fans that had turned on him. Hogan referred to a \\"new world organization of wrestling\\". The faction was soon dubbed the New World Order (nWo), beginning a feud between wrestlers loyal to WCW and the nWo. The fans in attendance were so outraged at Hogan's betrayal that they pelted the ring with debris, such as paper cups and plastic bottles, for the duration of his interview. One fan even jumped the security railing and tried to attack Hogan in the ring, but was swiftly subdued by Hall, Nash, and arena security. According to Bischoff, the original plan for the nWo was to have Sting be revealed as the third man rather than Hogan, but Hogan convinced Bischoff to make him the third man instead, with the reasoning that the third man needed to have WWF name value much like Hall and Nash did during their initial appearances as the Outsiders. Because of his tremendous success as the face of the WWF in the 1980s and early 1990s, Hogan was universally associated with the WWF and therefore was the perfect choice to lead the nWo. Hogan's heel turn at Bash at the Beach marked the first time in over 15 years that he portrayed a villainous character, and also served to revitalize his in-ring persona after his \\"Hulkamania\\" gimmick started to grow stale with WCW's audience. Shortly after, the WWF filed a lawsuit, alleging that the nWo storyline implied that Hall and Nash were invaders sent by Vince McMahon to destroy WCW, despite the fact that Bischoff asked Nash point blank on camera at The Great American Bash, \\"Are you employed by the WWF?\\" to which Nash emphatically replied \\"No\\". Another reason for the lawsuit was the WWF claimed Scott Hall acted in a manner too similar to the character Razor Ramon which was owned by the WWF. The lawsuit dragged out for several years before being settled out of court. One of the settlement's terms was the right for the WWF to bid on WCW's properties, should they ever be up for liquidation; a settlement that would prove invaluable in the future. Though an on-screen threat to the WCW promotion, the nWo would prove helpful in the early stages of the ratings war. On the September 23, 1996, episode of Nitro, with most of the WCW roster over in Japan, the group took over the entire show, including the broadcast booth and the ring announcer's role, and branded the episode as their own. The Giant was the ring announcer and Hollywood Hogan, Syxx, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Vincent, Ted DiBiase, and Eric Bischoff (who was not part of the faction at the time) were at the broadcast table. Largely due to the nWo angle, Nitro defeated Raw for 84 consecutive weeks. During this time, WCW occasionally revealed the endings to pre-taped Raw matches at the beginning of its live broadcast. Bischoff reasoned that fans who were open to switching between the two programs would be less inclined to switch to Raw if fans knew ahead of time how the matches would end.  Starrcade 1997  In 1997, WCW entered its peak. The nWo began feuding with the revived babyface Four Horsemen as well as the returning WCW hero Sting. Sting had changed his gimmick when he returned to WCW television, becoming a darker, brooding character, largely based on The Crow. Sting would be in the rafters of WCW arenas watching the WCW/nWo feud, and sometimes rappel down into the ring to help WCW wrestlers fighting the nWo. The latter feud served to build up Starrcade in December. When WCW delivered the Sting vs. Hogan match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, the event drew WCW's largest buyrate and Bischoff was largely praised in the months leading up to this event because of his refusal to give away (\\"hotshot\\" in wrestling slang) a Sting vs. Hogan title match for free or without proper buildup. Indeed, the Hogan/Sting angle endured for approximately 15 months. Wrestling fans consider this show to be the beginning of the end for WCW, however, even as they were dominating the WWF in the television ratings. Hogan was heavily criticized for not allowing a clean finish to the match, which confused and irritated fans who had waited over a year to see Sting take down the nWo. The finish actually involved a recently introduced Bret Hart, who had refereed the preceding match between Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko for control of Nitro, coming down to the ring after Hogan had supposedly won the match. Hart alleged that referee Nick Patrick had performed a fast count on Sting and wanted to \\"make things right\\". By many accounts, however, including Bischoff's in his memoir Controversy Creates Cash, the count looked like a normal count, so Hart's protestations did not make sense; replays of the three-count on later shows had the video sped up to hide this. Hart insisted that the match continue with himself as referee, in order to prevent Sting from being \\"screwed\\" like Hart had legitimately been at the Montreal Screwjob the month prior, which had ended his run with the WWF and hastened his arrival in WCW. In essence, whereas fans were promised a classic battle between Hogan and Sting in which the latter would defeat the leader of the nWo, they were presented with a faux reverse-tide potshot at the Montreal Screwjob. The inclusion of Hart himself confused and frustrated fans even more as Hart had no part in the feud between Hogan and Sting. To add insult to injury, it was decided that because of the messy finish to the match and the rematch on the following Monday's Nitro, Sting was stripped of the WCW title on January 8, 1998, on the debut episode of WCW Thunder. Hogan and Sting would face each other again for the vacant championship at SuperBrawl VIII the next month. Starrcade represented in many ways WCW's golden opportunity to pull farther ahead of the WWF and send the federation to its demise. With WCW steadily making money and firmly dominating the ratings battle, the PPV could have been a devastating blow to the WWF's comeback. However, WCW alienated its fan base instead. Even though the buy rate for Starrcade was the largest WCW had ever seen for a PPV, it was the turning point in the Monday Night Wars and the WWF would soon be on the rise.  Signs of a decline (1998‚Äì2001)  A television ratings comparison for the period of the Monday Night Wars. When Hart was planning to leave the WWF in 1997 after signing a contract to WCW prior to the Montreal Screwjob at the Survivor Series, it looked as though WCW was in position to permanently eclipse the WWF, if not put them out of business. WCW appeared to possess the biggest stars in the industry, such as Hogan, Savage, Sting, Flair, Hart, Hall and Nash. In addition, the company had credible midcard stars such as Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, and Raven, as well as an exciting cruiserweight division featuring high-flying international competition from Mexico and Japan, where the high-flying style of wrestling was popularized. However, things would not unfold as WCW had planned. Turner sought to capitalize on WCW's momentum by launching a new Thursday night show on TBS, WCW Thunder, in January 1998. Popular opinion was that the Screwjob and WCW's subsequent acquisition of Hart were death blows for the WWF. WCW had a golden opportunity to capture the allegiances of WWF fans who were disenchanted with the company after its poor treatment of a popular star. But according to Hart, the company failed to capitalize on his talent and momentum, and had no idea how to properly utilize him. Vince McMahon had described Hart as the kind of wrestler who a promoter builds his whole company around, but WCW generally used him as a midcarder. Their biggest hope was that Hart would help create inroads in foreign markets such as his native Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Bischoff contends that due to the events of Montreal, Hart's passion and desire for the business was not as it was during his WWF heyday. \\"Montreal...had taken his toll on him,\\" Bischoff stated in his autobiography. \\"It was all he talked about... constantly.\\" Furthermore, Hart would suffer an injury during a match with Goldberg that forced him into retirement. In any event, Hart's WCW tenure failed to live up to expectations. As WCW coasted with the same basic formula they had been following, McMahon set about revamping his creative approach and set in motion events that later put his company ahead of WCW for good. Under the \\"WWF Attitude\\" moniker, he elevated rising stars like Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H and his DX group, Mankind, and Kane. After Starrcade, Sting's presence on WCW's main card would begin to fade as he became an afterthought to the split-up of the nWo. As a result, his drawing power would decrease in the coming months. Meanwhile, Austin's popularity and stardom sparked a turnaround in Monday Night Raw‚Äôs ratings as he quickly became the WWF's franchise player. McMahon himself, after having played in a supporting role on camera as the play-by-play announcer, capitalized on the ill will he received from fans for screwing Bret Hart by turning himself into an on-screen villain. The \\"Mr. McMahon\\" heel character feuded with babyface wrestlers and used his influence to screw them out of wins and titles. Austin's feud with McMahon began to turn the tide in the WWF's favor. The April 13, 1998 episode of Raw, headlined by a match between Austin and McMahon, marked the first time that WCW lost the head-to-head Monday night ratings battle in 84 weeks. WWF ratings began an ascent to highs previously unheard of in wrestling on cable TV. WCW attempted to counter this by dividing the nWo into the Hogan-led heel nWo Hollywood faction and the Nash-led face nWo Wolfpac faction, but this was seen by many fans as a poor rehash of the WCW vs. nWo storyline of 1996‚Äì1997, with boring predictable matches and vignettes. WCW's next big attempt to regain ratings supremacy was by marketing ex-NFL player Bill Goldberg as an invincible monster with a record-breaking winning streak. WCW marketed Goldberg as their answer to Stone Cold Steve Austin; however, Goldberg's massive popularity ultimately did little to improve WCW's flagging ratings, especially as the list of stars ready to be destroyed by Goldberg grew shorter, not to mention the declining quality of the PPVs. One of WCW's last wins in the Monday night ratings war was on July 6, 1998, when WCW aired Goldberg's long-awaited world title victory over Hulk Hogan on free television. This significantly increased the rating for the show, but only for that week. Such a match could likely have generated millions, possibly tens of millions for WCW on pay-per-view had the angle been built up properly for a matter of months. On September 14, 1998, WCW won the ratings war once again with a memorable moment that featured Ric Flair's return to WCW (Flair had been absent from WCW programming for a brief period prior to this due to having legitimate conflicts with Eric Bischoff) to reform the legendary Four Horsemen. Nitro ended the night with a 4.5 rating, as opposed to the 4.0 rating attained by Raw. On October 25, 1998, WCW's Halloween Havoc ran longer than the time allocated because of the last-minute addition of a tag team title match between the champions (Scott Steiner and The Giant) and the challengers (Rick Steiner and Buff Bagwell), which Rick Steiner won by himself although Bagwell abandoned him as a tag partner. As a result, several thousand people lost their pay-per-view feed at 11pm during the highly anticipated world title match between Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg. The following night, WCW decided to correct the fault by airing the entire match for free on Nitro and won the ratings war for the final time. This timing faux pas upset millions of viewers who had paid for the pay-per-view of whom WCW were forced to reimburse, only to have to wait to see the main event for free the next night. Bill Goldberg's aforementioned undefeated streak was pivotal in WCW's efforts to compete with the WWF; within nearly a year, he had become one of WCW's most popular wrestlers and his streak became one of the company's biggest draws. Despite Goldberg's popularity, Kevin Nash, (who had been appointed as WCW's head booker) set himself up to defeat Goldberg at Starrcade. Though the match itself went well, it drew criticism for how it ended; Scott Hall ran in and tased Goldberg with a cattle prod, enabling Nash to pick up the win, ending Goldberg's streak and becoming the champion. Many believed the way the match ended damaged the aura of invincibility that had been built up around Goldberg for the past year-and-a-half. Many also believed that it was not time for Goldberg's streak to end and that Nash was not the right person to end it, and that he was simply abusing his power as the booker. With Goldberg's streak over, WCW's chances to compete with the WWF dwindled. Then came the match between Nash and Hulk Hogan on the January 4, 1999, episode of Nitro. The match was originally advertised as a Starrcade rematch between Nash and Goldberg. As a result, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta was a complete sellout, with over 40,000 people watching live expecting to see the rematch. Throughout the broadcast the announcers hyped the main event as being the \\"biggest match in the history of our sport\\" and said that \\"unlike the other guys, we have a real main event\\". Instead, Goldberg was forced to forgo his title match after being kayfabe arrested by the police for stalking Miss Elizabeth and was replaced by the returning Hogan, who had been absent from WCW for several months prior to this as part of an angle where he claimed to be retired from professional wrestling. Hogan faked a punch on Nash and then poked him in the chest. Nash oversold the poke in the chest by forcefully falling to the mat and allowing Hogan to pin him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. This effectively united the two separate nWo factions into a new faction, the nWo Elite. They hugged in the ring immediately afterwards until Goldberg made his way down to the ring along with Lex Luger, only to have Luger blindside him and Hall taser him with a shock stick once again, just like at Starrcade. This incident has become infamously known as the \\"Fingerpoke of Doom\\". This bait-and-switch damaged the credibility of the company as a whole, having failed to present the advertised match and using underhand tactics to sell out the arena for that night's telecast. Also, on the same episode of Nitro, play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone, under direction from Bischoff, revealed that Mick Foley, who was portraying his popular \\"Mankind\\" character at the time, would be winning the WWF Championship on a taped edition of Raw and mocked the WWF for making what he implied was a bad business decision (sarcastically saying \\"huh, that's gonna put some butts in the seats\\"). Nielsen ratings indicated that over 300,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in the WWF's favor. = Decline (1998‚Äì1999)= WCW slid into a period of extravagant overspending and creative decline; the reasons and the people responsible are still a matter of debate. One possible reason was the overuse of celebrities in pay-per-view matches, such as Dennis Rodman and Jay Leno. Also, WCW's credibility was damaged by product placement, such as Rick Steiner trading barbs with Chucky the killer doll in order to advertise the 1998 film Bride of Chucky. In addition, top-level stars had no motivation to excel in the ring due to their long-term contracts. WCW did not promote its younger stars to the company's top slots (a charge admitted by Bischoff). Despite having talented younger wrestlers like Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Billy Kidman, Chavo Guerrero, Jr., Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, Raven, Booker T., and Rey Mysterio, Jr. on its roster, they were kept away from the main event scene. Of these wrestlers listed, five would go on to headline main events in WWF/E and become World Champions (Both Eddie Guerrero and Booker T have also since been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame for their in-ring achievements), something WCW bookers believed these men would never be able to sell as. WCW programming had started to decline in quality, leading to a loss of viewers, and the company reacted by throwing money at personalities, something it could ill-afford to do. Talents were reportedly signed to keep them from appearing on WWF television. At one point, WCW held over 260 individual performers under guaranteed contracts, many of whom rarely appeared in its programs. During one Thunder program, only 15 of the 260 contracted wrestlers appeared on screen. Also in 1998, Bischoff recruited The Ultimate Warrior, a former WWF star, to feud with Hogan (to capitalize on the Hogan/Warrior match at WrestleMania VI). Their October 1998 rematch at Halloween Havoc was considered as one of the worst matches in pay-per-view history, and, although the feud between Warrior and Hogan leading up to the match was initially well received, interest soon dissipated after several convoluted and unrealistic segments involving the two were aired on WCW programming. Warrior also insisted on elaborate and costly apparatuses, such as a trapdoor in the ring which badly injured The British Bulldog when he landed on it awkwardly earlier in the event. Warrior would vanish from WCW shortly afterwards. According to Bischoff's autobiography Controversy Creates Cash, Time Warner increasingly micromanaged WCW, severely hindering (and occasionally overriding) Bischoff's control of the company. Time Warner initially gave him slight restrictions as to what he was and was not allowed to do with WCW. The restrictions mounted as time passed, with impending lawsuits between the WWF and WCW adding more. By the summer of 1998, he was outright ordered to alter WCW's format to a more \\"family-friendly\\" output. The forced shift in WCW's programming came while the WWF, buoyed by its new \\"Attitude\\" branding and product, was regularly beating an increasingly stagnant WCW week after week in the Monday night ratings war. Also, Time Warner had ordered WCW (like the other companies under Time Warner ownership) to slash their budget, putting even more strain on the company. As it was common knowledge that many executives in WCW ownership ‚Äî from the Turner-owned era to the AOL Time Warner years ‚Äì hated the idea of wrestling on their stations and attempted to remove the company entirely, Bischoff maintains that the restrictions and mandates placed on WCW was done in order to accomplish and accelerate the promotion's demise. By late 1999, WCW began losing around five million dollars a month. Attendance, pay-per-view buys and ratings were down significantly. Harvey Schiller, who served as the president of Turner Sports at the time and acted as Eric Bischoff's superior, had Bischoff removed from control of the promotion on September 10, 1999, after several failed storylines and marketing campaigns lost WCW a considerable amount of money. These included a failed push for the 1970s rock group KISS through WCW shows, a storyline involving rapper Master P and The No Limit Soldiers, and a failed contest to find a new member of the Nitro Girls.411mania.com: Music - Loop Diggin‚Äô Thursdays, News & Rants 2.23.06 KISS had collaborated with WCW to promote The Demon, a gimmick created in the band's image (the character was originally portrayed by Brian Adams and then by Dale Torborg); as a way of introducing The Demon, KISS closed out an episode of Nitro with a live performance of their hit song \\"God of Thunder\\", during which The Demon made his debut. The segment is widely considered to be one of the lowest-rated segments in the history of Nitro, and the Demon character quickly lost its momentum. A planned KISS-themed stable called The Warriors of KISS was scrapped when the angle was dropped. The No Limit Soldiers were introduced as part of a music-themed angle pitting them against the country music-themed stable The West Texas Rednecks, with the whole program being an attempt by WCW to cash in on the popularity of hip hop music at the time. However, despite the fact that the No Limit Soldiers were presented as the babyfaces in the feud, WCW's mostly Southern audience rejected them and cheered the villainous West Texas Rednecks instead. With Bischoff's removal, an announced \\"million- dollar contest\\" was later cancelled and a planned Nitro animated series was scrapped as well. The Road Wild pay-per-view event (a Bischoff creation) would also be discontinued. = Vince Russo (1999‚Äì2000) = Vince Russo (pictured on the right). Bischoff was unexpectedly replaced by then WCW Vice President of Strategic Planning Bill Busch, who was named Senior Vice President. Busch would bring in former WWF head writer Vince Russo and his colleague Ed Ferrara. Russo and Ferrera presented themselves as the brains behind the \\"Attitude Era\\", and WCW offered them lucrative contracts to jump ship in October 1999. Russo and Ferrara tried to replicate the same writing format (known as \\"Crash TV\\") they had used to revamp the WWF's creative product in the onset of the Attitude Era, but at a more accelerated pace. They also tried to push the younger WCW talents straight away, and phase out aging stars such as Hogan and Flair. Russo and Ferrara struggled to gain approval for their near-the-knuckle ideas from WCW management, such as a \\"Pi√±ata on a Pole\\" match between Mexican wrestlers on November 15. In late 1999, Russo and Ferrera revived the nWo as the nWo 2000, this time with Jeff Jarrett and Bret Hart at the helm. They next targeted WWF announcer Jim Ross with a parody character called \\"Oklahoma,\\" who was played onscreen by Ferrara and would go on to win the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Ross suffered from Bell's palsy, and the character lampooned his resultant facial defects. The gimmick was very poorly received by many within the wrestling community, claiming that the character was in bad taste (and even sparking a legitimate feud between Ed Ferrara and Jim Cornette, one of Ross' close friends, that has persisted to present day). Bad luck struck in December 1999 when Hart suffered a career-ending concussion at the hands of Goldberg, who nearly ended up costing himself his career less than a week later when he sliced open a major artery in his forearm while punching through a limousine window in Salisbury, Maryland, as part of a storyline that was written by Russo. Russo himself became an on-screen character during this period, though one whose face was never shown on camera; only his hand and the back of his chair were ever actually seen, as he called wrestlers into his office to receive their marching orders for the night. This became part of a recurring theme in Vince Russo's WCW as \\"worked shoots\\" became regular occurrences on WCW programming as a way of blurring the lines between what was legitimate and what was not. Russo and Ferrara were suspended three months later amid rumors that they wanted to make former UFC fighter Tank Abbott the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Abbott, despite his legitimate fighting background, had little wrestling experience and had failed to connect with WCW audiences. Kevin Sullivan, who had been an on/off booker over the course of several years, was appointed as the new head writer in the interim. The new writing team attempted to appease the demoralized wrestlers and fans by putting the World Heavyweight Championship on Chris Benoit at Souled Out in January 2000. However, Benoit was among a group of wrestlers who expressed their intent to leave the company prior to the show because Sullivan was not particularly fond of them. Benoit, in particular, had a personal grievance with Sullivan dating back several months as a storyline with the two that involved Benoit winning the services of Sullivan's manager, Woman (Sullivan's then-wife Nancy), led to an extramarital affair that resulted in a real life relationship developing between Benoit and Woman. Benoit, along with his similarly frustrated friends Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn among several others, voiced their grievances to Busch, who initially told them he would take Sullivan off Nitro and Thunder where they wouldn't have to work under him, only to turn around and tell them they were all being sent home except Benoit. Benoit doubled down on his stance and backed his fellow wrestlers. He handed the belt back right after winning it and he, along with Guerrero, Malenko, and Saturn, signed with the WWF the next day. The four quickly became popular in the WWF as \\"The Radicalz\\". On February 11, 2000, 12 wrestlers, including African American wrestler Hardbody Harrison and Japanese manager Sonny Onoo launched racial discrimination lawsuits against WCW, charging that, as a result of their ethnicities, they had not been pushed, had not been paid as well as other wrestlers and personalities, and had been given offensive gimmicks. Some speculated that the charges of racism led to African American wrestler Booker T. winning the WCW Championship later that year, and his real-life brother Stevie Ray being made a color commentator; Stevie Ray himself acknowledged that it may have been a factor. Onoo claimed that he had been given a disrespectful gimmick and that his final salary‚Äî$160,000‚Äîwas only half of the average pay for a wrestler at that time. Under Russo's leadership, WCW would continue to lose ratings. On January 3, 2000, Nitro was reduced to two hours in an attempt to bolster the show's aggregate ratings score, but the elimination of the show's third hour accelerated the company's ratings decline; Nitro registered a 1.8 rating for its April 3, 2000 episode, which was the second lowest WCW television rating to date (ahead of only the 1.72 rating on April 27, 1998). = Final year (2000‚Äì2001)= In April 2000, with ratings hitting new lows, Russo and Bischoff were reinstated by WCW, where, in another attempt to get WCW's creative product turned around, they decided to reboot WCW into a more modern, streamlined company. All angles taking place at the time were immediately dropped and all championships were vacated, effectively \\"re-starting\\" WCW with a clean slate. Russo and Bischoff believed that this approach was the most effective way to salvage WCW's damaged product. The first major storyline to take place in WCW following the reboot saw Bischoff and Russo form an on-screen union that stood up for the younger talent in the company (which they dubbed the New Blood) in their battle against the Millionaire's Club, which consisted of the older, higher-paid, and more visible stars such as Hogan, Sting, and Diamond Dallas Page. Though initially well received, the storyline quickly degenerated into yet another nWo rehash, with the heel nWo recast as the New Blood and the face WCW embodied in the Millionaire's Club. Had the reverse been done, with the New Blood as faces and Millionaire's Club as heels, the angle may have worked but many saw the casting as an attempt for sympathy towards the veterans who had already gained bad reputations behind the scenes. Oddly, the New Blood was disbanded before the New Blood Rising pay-per-view began. The unorthodox and controversial storylines continued. Although neither was a trained wrestler, both Russo and actor David Arquette each won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, the latter in order to promote the box-office flop Ready to Rumble (though Arquette was vehemently against winning the championship, believing that fans, like himself, would detest a non-wrestler winning the title). As neither looked physically capable of defeating actual wrestlers in a match, the title's credibility hit rock-bottom as a result (in WWE's The Rise and Fall of WCW documentary, Jim Ross said that Arquette winning the championship was a \\"farce\\" and an \\"embarrassment\\", and David Crockett, the brother of Jim Crockett, Jr. who worked as one of WCW's backstage producers, said that WCW might as well \\"throw [the title] in the trash can\\"). Goldberg turned heel for the first time in his career at The Great American Bash, but the execution of the turn was botched, and after a lackluster feud with Kevin Nash and a failed attempt to duplicate his original streak, Goldberg's drawing power was greatly diminished. During this time period, Vince Russo had many behind-the-scenes conflicts with Hulk Hogan. Russo believed that Hogan's time in the spotlight was over and began using him less and less on WCW programming. Whenever Hogan did appear, he was usually relegated to essentially being a \\"jobber to the stars\\", being forced to job to other main- event wrestlers such as Sting and Goldberg, as well as to Billy Kidman, whom Russo had Hogan feud with in an attempt to elevate Kidman to main-event status; however, the feud did little for either Kidman or Hogan. When it was announced that Hogan would be facing Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Bash at the Beach, the writing team informed Hogan that he would be jobbing to Jarrett once again. Hogan, however, invoked his creative control and demanded that he win the match and the title. Russo agreed to the finish, but added that the finish would involve no wrestling at all, just Jarrett simply laying down for Hogan to pin him, which Hogan strongly disagreed with. During the actual match at the event, Jarrett indeed lied down for Hogan, with Russo physically coming down to the ring and throwing the title belt at Hogan's feet. A visibly frustrated Hogan then grabbed a microphone and broke character, saying, \\"Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!\\" Hogan pinned Jarrett to win the match, but only moments later, Russo came back out and immediately voided Hogan's title win before delivering a shoot speech aimed at Hogan, during which he referred to Hogan as a \\"piece of shit\\" and that WCW fans would \\"never see [him] again\\", effectively firing Hogan live on pay-per-view. This eventually led to Hogan filing a defamation of character lawsuit, which was dismissed in 2002. Infuriated by Russo's actions (which conflicted with his intentions for Bash), Bischoff departed once more in July 2000. At the New Blood Rising pay-per-view on August 13, an injured Goldberg walked out of a triple threat elimination contest against Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner (violating the script of the match) and swore at Russo on his way back to the dressing room on-camera, leaving Steiner to wrestle and lose to Nash by himself. As a result of Goldberg's actions at New Blood Rising, the storyline was drastically changed to a rivalry between Steiner and Goldberg, culminating in a match at Fall Brawl in September 2000, which Steiner won. Immediately afterward, Russo informed Goldberg that if he ever lost another match from that point, he would be released from his WCW contract. In truth however, this was an opportunity for Goldberg to heal from previous injuries. Russo was gone from the promotion entirely by late 2000, leaving Terry Taylor and Johnny Ace holding the reins. During this time, a short-lived crossover feud began involving stars of WCW and Battle Dome. At the Sin pay-per-view on January 14, 2001, Goldberg and his trainer DeWayne Bruce lost a tag team match to Totally Buffed (Buff Bagwell and The Total Package). This was Goldberg's final appearance for WCW before the company was purchased by the WWF. The final WCW event to be held outside the Southeast was the January 15 edition of WCW Monday Nitro from Fort Wayne, Indiana; following this event and its associated taping of WCW Thunder (which took place the same night), all future WCW events were held in the Southeast as a debt-reducing measure. In addition, most female personalities were released from the promotion by the beginning of February 2001 in an attempt to cut costs.  Attempted Bischoff/Fusient purchase (2001) Meanwhile, Time Warner had bought out Turner's empire in 1996, including WCW. Turner was personally faithful to WCW regardless of whether it was losing him money because an earlier incarnation of the promotion had helped establish Turner's first television station, WTBS. However, Time Warner did not share his loyalty especially when accounts showed that WCW was losing between $12‚Äì$17 million a year at this point (and $60 million in 2000 alone), but Turner was still the single largest Time Warner shareholder, so WCW continued to operate at his behest. When AOL merged with Time Warner in 2000, Turner was effectively forced out. Although WCW tried to alleviate the strain of debt in early 2001, the financial burdens proved too much for the promotion and its new parent, AOL Time Warner. Once it gained the power to sell off WCW, AOL Time Warner looked to do so in order to cut its losses. A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff and a group of private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place. However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head Jamie Kellner formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended on being able to continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from Fox and NBC.  Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath  On March 23, 2001, all of WCW's trademarks and archived video library, as well as a select twenty-four contracts, were sold to Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. through its subsidiary, WCW, Inc. WCW's intangible properties were purchased for $3,000,000. Most of the main event-level stars including Ric Flair, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, and Sting were contracted directly to parent company AOL Time Warner instead of WCW, and thus AOL Time Warner was forced to continue to pay many of the wrestlers for years. The company's legal name reverted to Universal Wrestling Corporation; it would remain listed as a subsidiary of Time Warner until December 16, 2017, when it was merged into Turner Broadcasting System. TNT did allow a final Nitro show to air from Panama City Beach, Florida which had been scheduled for the following Monday on March 26. McMahon opened the last-ever episode of WCW Monday Nitro with a simulcast with WWF Monday Night Raw, which aired from Cleveland, Ohio, with a self-praising speech. The final WCW World Heavyweight Championship match for the show and the company saw WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Booker T defeat Scott Steiner to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The main event featured Sting defeating Ric Flair with the Scorpion Deathlock as a culmination of their trademark feud, then both men embraced one another at the match's conclusion. This was a direct parallel to the very first Nitro, where Sting vs. Flair was also featured. After the Sting/Flair match, Vince appeared on Raw to close Nitro and to declare victory over WCW. Vince's son Shane McMahon then appeared on Nitro, declaring that it was actually he who had bought WCW. This initiated a storyline in which Shane led a WCW invasion of the WWF, which lasted from March to November 2001 and marked the end of WCW. The last WCW broadcast was the already-taped final episode of WCW WorldWide which aired in syndication six days after the final Nitro broadcast (one day before WrestleMania X-Seven, although several stations aired it in the early hours of the day of the event). Despite aborted attempts to run WCW-branded events (including a proposed Saturday night timeslot that later evolved into WWF Excess and then WWE Velocity) the WWF only ran a handful of matches on Raw and SmackDown! under the WCW banner. These WCW-branded matches were ill-received by the longtime WWF fans so much that on the very first WCW-brand main event between Booker T and Buff Bagwell the crowd cheered when the WWF heels Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle ran in to jump the WCW face Booker T. In 2004, WWE produced a DVD called The Monday Night Wars. Two hours in length, the DVD left out a large portion of the wars, breaking off around 1997 before jumping straight to the post-WCW era of WWE. The objectivity of the DVD's content was questioned, as some believed the documentary was simply telling the WWE side of the story. On August 25, 2009, WWE released The Rise and Fall of WCW on DVD. The DVD looked back at the roots of WCW during the days of GCW and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, to the glory days of Monday Nitro and the nWo, and to its demise and sale to WWE. This DVD included several new interviews from Vince McMahon, Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Bill Goldberg, as well as many of those responsible for running the NWA and WCW. Archive interviews were included from former WCW talent such as Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, due to their respective contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling not allowing them to provide fresh interviews for WWE. In 2014, WWE Network released a new documentary series, The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW, covering a much broader scope of the wars than the previous Monday Night Wars DVD, as well as providing more equal viewpoints for both WWE and WCW.

It premiered at the Soho Theatre in London, England, on 3 May 2007.https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2007/leaves-of-glass-review-at-soho- theatre-london/ The play was commissioned and directed by Lisa Goldman after being greatly impressed by Ridley's previous adult stage play Mercury Fur. The production was Lisa Goldman's first in her tenure as artistic director of the Soho Theatre. Like Mercury Fur the play starred Ben Whishaw in its premiere production. It is the second entry in Ridley's unofficially titled \\"Brothers Trilogy\\", having been preceded by Mercury Fur and followed by Piranha Heights. Story The play is about two brothers, Steven and Barry. Steven is the head of a successful graffiti removal company and Barry, his younger brother, works for him as he is struggling to get income and recognition from being an artist. The play concerns the silence which has prevailed over a traumatic incident from their childhood, which for years they have been unwilling to talk about and come to terms with. Structure Leaves of Glass was the first of Ridley's plays for adults that completely rejects Aristotle's unities of drama, with the story instead taking place in a variety of locations and spanning many months. It has seventeen scenes and no interval with the play lasting approximately two hours in performance. Although two of Ridley's previous plays The Fastest Clock in the Universe and Ghost from a Perfect Place each had two acts with a space for an interval, each act retained the same location with a very small time gap between each.

He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and Senate, followed by two terms as a United States Representative for the 3rd congressional district (1867 to 1870). His brother Edward Isaac Golladay also became an attorney and served as a US Congressman from Tennessee.  Early life  James Golladay was born in 1819 in Lebanon, Tennessee. His father Isaac was a descendant of French Hugenots who emigrated to Virginia about 1700 to escape religious persecution in France. The spelling of the family name is likely an anglicised version of the French surname \\"Gallaudet\\". His mother was of German ancestry, with immigrant ancestors who arrived later in the 18th century. In 1815 the Golladay family moved to Lebanon, Tennessee, where both Jacob and his younger brother Edward were born. After attending public school, Jacob moved in 1838 to Logan County, Kentucky (later organized as Todd County), where he worked for seven years in a wholesale store. In 1845 he settled in Allensville, on the southern border of the state, where he started a practice as a lawyer. In 1846 Golladay married Elizabeth Cheatham, step-daughter of Prof. VV. K. Bolling, of Nashville, Tennessee, who became president of the American Medical Association. They had five children: Melissa, John Jacob, Archer, Bowling, and Elizabeth. Only Bowling survived to adulthood; he was educated at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. All of the children are buried beside their parents.  Politics  In 1851 Golladay won election as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Allensville. He resigned in 1853 to take up a seat in the Kentucky Senate, stepping down in 1855 after a single term. In 1860, Golladay was chosen as an elector for Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and running mate Edward Everett for the Kentucky's 3rd congressional district. This party favored preservation of the Union, but urged compromise and peaceful solutions. On December 5, 1867 he was elected as a Democrat to the Fortieth Congress, representing Kentucky's 3rd congressional district following the death of the previous Representative, Elijah Hise. He was re- elected to the Forty-first Congress but retired on February 28, 1870, before the end of his term. Later life After Congress, Golladay resumed his legal practice in Allensville, Kentucky. He died near Russellville in 1887 and was buried next to his son in Maple Grove Cemetery.

In 2009, Jefferson-Morgan School District administrative reported there were four incidents of bullying in the district. A district bullying policy is not posted on the Jefferson-Morgan School District's website. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.Pennsylvania Academic Standards Special education In December 2011, Jefferson-Morgan School District administration reported that 155 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 44% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Jefferson-Morgan School District administration reported that 162 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 40% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 253 pupils or 17% of the District's pupils received Special Education services, with 45% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the Jefferson-Morgan School District or contact the District's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Jefferson-Morgan School District received a $623,238 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 35 or 4.10% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student should have an intelligence quotient (IQ) \\"of 130 or higher, when multiple criteria ... indicate gifted ability\\", \\"[d]etermination of gifted ability will not be based on IQ score alone\\" and \\"[a] person with an IQ score lower than 130 may be admitted to gifted programs when other educational criteria in the profile of the person strongly indicate gifted ability.\\" The determination \\"must include an assessment by a certified school psychologist.\\" Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Jefferson-Morgan School District was $51,353 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $24,183 per employee (which is among the highest costs in Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts).

The District reported zero in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2008, Jefferson-Morgan School District reported per pupil spending was $13,259 which ranked 155th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts.

Tuition Students who live in the Jefferson-Morgan School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Jefferson-Morgan School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,863.19, High School - $12,188.50. Lawsuit In 2006, Connie L.

The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.U.S. Department of Education, Race to the Top Fund, March 29, 2010 =Common Cents state initiative= The school board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. The plan showed the district could save hundreds of thousands of dollars each year by sharing services with other school districts through the region's Intermediate Unit. Intermediate Units in Pennsylvania are part of the governance structure of public education in the Commonwealth. They were designed primarily to provide services to local school districts that can be operated more effectively and efficiently on a regional basis. The district is served by IU#1.Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents Program - Report Jefferson-Morgan School District =Enrollment and Consolidation= In 2010 a study on the possible consolidation of services between Carmichaels Area School District, Jefferson-Morgan School District and Southeastern Greene School District is being conducted.Carmichaels Area panel OKs early payment to Greene tech school, Herald Standard, November 21, 2010 A study was done in 2004, examining consolidating Jefferson-Morgan School District with neighboring Bethlehem-Center School District located in Washington County, with Carmichaels Area School District or with Southeastern Greene School District in Greene County. It was estimated that several million dollars in savings would be achieved in these consolidations.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007 Part 2 page 152. The study noted that consolidation could significantly decrease administrative costs for both communities while improving offerings to students. Consolidation of school district administrations does not require the consolidation of schools. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. From 2000-2010, Pennsylvania public school district enrollment decreased over 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline was in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Statewide, there are 187 districts that were projected to have an enrollment decline of 15 percent or greater. Geographically, these districts are clustered in western Pennsylvania and in the state's northern tier. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the school board at 23.6500 mills.Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, Pennsylvania Department of Education. 2010 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 23.0909 mills. *2010-11 - 23.0909 mills *2009-10 ‚Äì 23.0909 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 ‚Äì 23.0909 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 23.0909 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 23.0909 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 22.2910 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Greene County residents amounts to about 2.77% of their yearly income. Greene County ranked 748th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2013-2014, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, Jefferson-Morgan School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the 2011-12 school year, the Jefferson-Morgan School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.

The Daily Item, May 25, 2010 Property tax relief In 2012, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Jefferson-Morgan School District was $239 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 1,818 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Greene County, 37% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Greene County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to Central Greene School District at $296. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 This was the third year they were the top recipient. *2010 - $243 for 1,790 properties *2009 ‚Äì $255 for 1,708 properties. *2008 ‚Äì $296 for 1,473 properties. Wellness policy Jefferson- Morgan School Board established a district wellness program in 2006Jefferson- Morgan Wellness The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The policy requires that the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness.

Background Detective Sergeant Frank Tripp (Rex Linn) in the Homicide division of the Miami-Dade Police Department in CSI: Miami, (season 5-10; recurring seasons 1-4), is a homicide detective who regularly accompanies the team to the crime scenes. He joined the police force prior to applicants needing an undergraduate degree; although he is not as highly educated as the rest of the team, his knowledge and \\"street smarts\\" about the local area come in handy during investigations. He has a gruff appreciation for the capabilities of the CSIs and their excellent results. Consequently, he has a good working relationship with all the CSIs, particularly Calleigh Duquesne. He is divorced, with three kids (episode 118, \\"Dispo Day\\"). Before the season six premiere, Tripp is promoted to sergeant and it's seen that he has shaved his head. After passing the sergeant's exam, Tripp was required to spend some time in uniform on a patrol rotation. By episode #611, \\"Guerrillas in the Mist\\", he finished his mandatory patrol rotation and is back in Homicide, where his new title is given as \\"MDPD Homicide Detective Sergeant Frank Tripp\\". Frank Tripp is originally from Texas. (Rex Linn, a Texas native later raised in Oklahoma, once missed a day's shooting of CSI: Miami to watch the Rose Bowl when the Texas Longhorns were playing.) Now that he's part of the MDPD, he's since become an avid Florida Gators fan. As a child, Tripp dreamed of being a firefighter. However, after his leg was shattered in a car accident, he fell in love with crime fiction during his many weeks' convalescence. Consequently, he joined the police force straight out of school, and was later transferred to MDPD's gang unit before moving to Homicide. Tripp frequently accompanies Horatio Caine and his team of CSIs to crime scenes, especially those that involve dangerous gangsters and criminals, as well as assisting them in serving warrants. Relationships The only one of Tripp's relationships that is mentioned in the show is a past marriage to his wife, Melissa, with whom he had three children, who remain unnamed. He divorced her after her alcoholism got out of hand. As their marriage deteriorates, she suspects him of cheating on her, and she hired a detective agency whose sole objective is to tempt men into cheating on their spouses and then report it. When the undercover investigator assigned to Frank is murdered, he becomes a suspect because the CSIs discover his fingerprints on her hotel room keycard. Eric Delko keeps Tripp's name quiet until he determines that Frank is not guilty of the murder, but Tripp is hurt by the suspicion nonetheless (episode 209, \\"Bait\\"). It was revealed in the season seven special features that Rex Linn stated \\"Give Frank a girlfriend or at least a dog.\\" References Category:CSI: Miami characters Category:Fictional Miami-Dade Police Department detectives Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Television characters introduced in 2003 ","title":"Frank Tripp"},{"id":"11187539","text":"Partitioning Communication System is a computer and communications security architecture based on an information flow separation policy.

Their early success is attributed to two singles, \\"Mannequin\\" in 1979 and \\"Cherchez le gar√ßon\\" in 1980. Their music was said to capture the energy of The Stooges, mixed with the retro-futuristic soundscapes of Kraftwerk.

The surrounding lands are home to Al Jib Bedouin. Since 1967, Al Jib has been occupied by Israel and about 90% of its lands are classified as Area C. About a quarter of the land is seized by Military Orders for the establishment of Israeli settlements. The neighborhood Al Khalayleh was separated by the West Bank barrier. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Al Jib had a population of approximately 4,700 in 2006.Projected Mid -Year Population for Jerusalem Governorate by Locality 2004- 2006 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics The modern village is identified with the ancient city of Gibeon. Location Al Jib is a Palestinian village located (horizontally) north-west of Jerusalem. It is bordered by Bir Nabala and Al Judeira to the east, Beituniya to the north, Beit Ijza and Biddu to the west, and An Nabi Samwil to the south. History The 10th-century lexicographer, David ben Abraham al-Fasi, identified Al Jib with the ancient city, Gibeon, which view was corroborated also by the Hebrew Lexicon compiled by Wilhelm Gesenius and Frants Buhl (\\"now al-«¶ƒ´b\\").Solomon Skoss, The Hebrew-Arabic Dictionary of the Bible known as Kitab Jami al-Alfaz (Agron) of David ben Abraham Al-Fasi, the Karaite (New Haven: Yale 1936), introd. p. xxxviii. However, the first scientific identification of Al Jib with the ancient Canaanite city of Gibeon was made by Edward Robinson in 1838.Brooks, 2005, pp. 93-94. Archaeological excavations led by James Pritchard in 1956, 1957, and 1959 confirmed this identification with the discovery of 56 jar handles inscribed with the Semitic triliteral gb'n. The inscriptions were dated to the end of the Judean monarchy and have been cross-referenced against genealogical lists in the Book of Chronicles. While they include many Benjaminite names, they also include non-Israelite names, attesting to the intermixing of local population. A vaulted building still remaining in the centre of Al Jib has been dated from between the mid-5th and mid-8th centuries CE.Pringle, 1993, p. 279 The building has earlier been described as a churchGu√©rin, 1868, p. 385 from the Crusader era, with \\"total length of the chapel appears to have been 40 feet east and west, 22 feet north and south. The apses have been apparently built up. There were three bays of arches, and in the side walls are small doors with lintels\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 100 D.

The stones outside are large; and the whole appearance is that of antiquity.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 136-137 El-Jib was further noted as a Muslim village, part of the El-Kuds district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 121 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin found that Al Jib had 500 inhabitants,Gu√©rin, 1868, pp. 385-391 while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that the village had a population of 219, in a total of 65 houses, though that population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 153 It was also noted to be in the El-Kuds districtHartmann, 1883, p. 127, also noted 65 houses In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as \\"on the end of a hill, rising 300 feet above the valley. On the south is a narrow plain, and there is an open valley on the east, whilst to the north and west there is also a flat plain. The hill is thus isolated, and a position naturally of great strength. The houses cover the northern part of the hill. The village is of moderate size, the houses of stone, with a central tower, and massive foundations exist among the modern buildings. On the east, rather lower than the village and a little below the top of the ridge, is the spring, which issues from a cave. Below it are remains of a good-sized reservoir. There are many springs on the south and west, and caves in the southern side of the hill.

Since 1967, Israel has confiscated 26.6% of Al Jib‚Äôs lands to establish large urban Israeli settlements Givon (1978), Giv'on HaHadashah (1980) and Giv'at Ze'ev (1982).Al Jib Village Profile, ARIJ, 2012, pp. 17-20 Under the 1995 Oslo II Accord, 7.5% of the total village area was classified as Area B, and the remaining 92.5% became Area C, under full Israeli control.  Separation wall  The barrier in northern Jerusalem, which confines Al Jib to an enclave under Israeli control. In 2005, Israel started the construction of a separation barrier around Al Jib, al-Judeira, Bir Nabala, Beit Hanina al-Balad and Kalandiya.High Court approves Bir Nabalah enclave. B'Tselem, 26 November 2006 The wall was built on Palestinian land seized by Military Orders.Israel‚Äôs Segregation Wall Encircles Three Palestinian Villages in Northwest Jerusalem . ARIJ, 7 May 2005 The wall completely surrounds the villages, forming an enclave. One effect is that it prevents the Palestinian residents without Israeli citizenship or permanent residency cards from using the nearby road-system serving Jerusalem and nearby Israeli settlements. The wall has also divided the village of Al Jib. Part of their farm-land lies on the other side of the wall and only a limited number of residents have limited access. A complete neighborhood, Al Khalayleh, with an estimated population of 700 citizens, is now located west of the Wall in a separate enclave between Israeli settlements. In April 2012, Israel demolished a number of houses in Al Khalayleh and displaced 67 Palestinian refugees from the neighborhood, most of whom were children. About half of Al Jib's total area, including Al Khalayleh, is located on the other side of the barrier. Israel claims that it intends to build two alternate roads that will link the enclave to the rest of the West Bank to prevent its complete isolation. One will connect the enclave with Ramallah, which lies to its north, while the other will connect Al Jib to the Bedouin area, which lies to its west, by means of three underground passageways and two bridges. The road's construction will require complex engineering work and will cost tens of millions of shekels, so it is likely that the project will take a long time, if ever, to complete B'Tselem points out that because thousands of the enclave's residents hold Israeli identity cards, they are entitled to free access to East Jerusalem by law, and that the barrier thus \\"will severely impair [their] human rights\\" by cutting off direct access. Preservation Al Jib is on the list of \\"Endangered Cultural Heritage Sites in the West Bank Governorates\\" compiled by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOCIP) of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) due to the excavations of ancient Gibeon. During the second Intifada, the Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange (PACE) brought together Palestinian youth and elders from the surrounding villages to repair and restore the ancient water pool and other sites around the village.

He is considered to be one of the top European straight-ahead jazz musicians of the post-1970 period. Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins were early influences, while he later developed a highly personal sound reminiscent of Zoot Sims. Thilo first recorded as a leader for Storyville Records in 1973 and in the 1980s on Storyville his sidemen at various times included Kenny Drew, Clark Terry and Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison. In the 1980s he also played in the Ernie Wilkins's Almost Big Band. Thilo also appears on the Miles Davis album Aura recorded in 1985. In 1991 he worked with Hank Jones in a quintet. Biography Jesper Thilo was born on Christianshavn in Copenhagen in 1941 to a pianist-actress mother and a father who was an architect. He started to play clarinet at age 11 and from 1955 to 1960 he played clarinet and trombone in various amateur Dixieland jazz bands with occasional paid jobs as a musician. Early he knew that he wanted to become a professional jazz musician but to get an education he chose to study classical clarinet at the Royal Danish Academy of Music While still a student at the Academy, Thilo joined Arnved Meyer's orchestra where he played from 1960 to 1964 and again from 1967 to 1974 and it was Arnved Meyer who convinced him to shift to saxophone. In Meyer's band he played with musicians such as Ben Webster, Benny Carter, Harry Edison, Roy Eldridge and Coleman Hawkins. During this part of his career his virile Swing style chiefly inspired by Webster and Hawkins. Besides his engagement in Meyer's orchestra, Thilo also played in his own band, a quintet which he had founded in 1965 and co-lead with Torolf M√∏lgaard and Bjarne Rostvold. From 1966 to 1989 Thilo was a member of the DR Big Band where he under bandleaders such as Palle Mikkelborg and Thad Jones mainly played alto saxophone but occasionally also tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, baritone saxophone, concert flute, clarinet or bass clarinet. Up through the 1980s he played in Ernie Wilkins' Almost Big Band. Other collaborators have included Wild Bill Davison and Niels J√∏rgen Steen. In 1989 he left the DR Big Band and Ernie Wilkins's orchestra to lead his own bands with members such as S√∏ren Kristiansen, Olivier Antunes, Hugo Rasmussen og Svend-Erik N√∏rregaard.

Discovery and Current Data  The resistome was first used to describe the resistance capabilities of bacteria preventing the effectiveness of antibiotics . Although antibiotics and their accompanying antibiotic resistant genes come from natural habitats, before next-generation sequencing, most studies of antibiotic resistance had been confined to the laboratory. Increased availability of whole-genome and metagenomic next-generation sequencing techniques have revealed significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria outside of clinical settings. Repeated testing of soil metagenomes revealed that in urban, agricultural, and forest environments, spore-forming soil bacteria showed resistance to most major antibiotics regardless of where they'd originated. In this study, they observed nearly 200 different resistance profiles among the bacteria sequenced, indicating a diverse and robust response to the antibiotics tested regardless of their bacterial target or natural or synthetic origin. Antibiotic resistant bacteria have observed through metagenomic surveys in non-clinical environments such as water treatment facilities and human microbiomes like the mouth. We now know that the antibiotic resistome exists in every environmental niche on Earth, and sequences from ancient permafrost reveal that antibiotic resistance has been around millennia before the introduction of human-synthesized antibiotics. The Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD) was created to compile a database of resistance genes from this rapidly increasingly available bacterial genomic data. The CARD is a compilation of sequence data and identification of resistance genes in unannotated genome sequences. The database \\"includes bioinformatic tools that enable the identification of antibiotic resistance genes from whole- or partial-genome sequence data, including unannotated raw sequence assembly contigs‚Äù. It is a resource intended to create a better understanding of the resistome and links healthcare, environmental, agricultural datasets. = Human pathogens = A major question surrounding the environmental resistome is: How do pathogenic bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance genes from the environment (and vice versa)? To answer this, we need to consider the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and the various opportunities for contact between environmental bacteria and human pathogens. In soil antibiotic resistant bacterial communities, resistance-conferring genes have been found on mobile genetic elements. Similarly, in an analysis of the resistome in a water treatment plant, plasmids and other protein-coding mobile genetic elements were present at all levels of filtration, and these mobile elements harbored genes for resistance. These soil and water-based resistant communities are known as reservoirs, from which resistance can transfer to pathogenic bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing and short-read based assembly have revealed the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes between non-pathogenic environmental soil bacteria and clinical pathogens. The portions in the soil bacteria perfectly match the identity of several diverse human pathogens and contain resistance cassettes against five classes of antibiotics. These resistance cassettes also contain sequences that reflect recent horizontal gene transfer and provide the mechanism for how that transfer occurred. These antibiotic resistant genes also retain their functionality even after they are entirely removed from the context of their original host, emphasizing their compatibility with a wide range of hosts, including pathogens. Interestingly, the high conservation of resistance gene identity also was observed in the human gut microbiome. Although the average amino acid similarity between human gut microbiota and resistant pathogens was only around 30.2 to 45.5%, their resistance genes perfectly matched those of the pathogenic bacteria, suggesting the resistomes of the human gastrointestinal tract, soil, and clinical pathogens are all connected. It should be noted, however, that the risk of transmission cannot simply be extrapolated from abundance of resistome genes in a population, and a multifaceted approach to risk analyses should be considered to fully understand the risks posed. For example, the mobility of antibiotic resistant genes has been observed to be dependent on if the population is pathogenic or not, with pathogen communities having far higher proportions of mobile genetic elements. When antibiotic resistance is present in the environment, it is important to consider how human pathogens are interacting or integrated into those environments, and how antibiotic resistance is being exchanged there. For example, mouth bacteria can reach other parts of the body through the digestive and blood systems, and our saliva readily transfers bacteria to other people, so there are several ways for antibiotic resistant bacteria in the oral micriobiome to readily transfer their resistance genes to other, potentially pathogenic bacterial communities. Additionally, soil and pathogenic resistomes have been observed not to be distinct, so it‚Äôs essential that we understand environmental resistance in aquatic and other environments with high likelihood of human pathogen interaction. In the hyper-antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa environmental stress key to the way its resistome is expressed; intrinsic, acquired, and adaptive forms of resistant gene expression occur under different environmental pressures and lead to significant challenges in developing effective treatments in response. Our understanding of how humans create additional positive selective pressure for antibiotic resistance in non-clinical environments is essential now more than ever. The rise in antibiotic resistance has severely reduced the efficacy of antibiotic drugs, posing severe cause for concern in the realm of drug development and maintaining public health. Human-manufactured antibiotics are not the only source of antibiotic resistant pressure in the wild, as antibiotics are present at various concentrations and function as both defense and signaling mechanisms, selecting for antibiotic resistance naturally in the environment. For this reason, studying natural antibiotics and the patterns of antibiotic resistance that naturally arise in the wild may help us to predict and respond to antibiotic resistance in clinical settings. Analyses of metagenomic sequence data are useful tools for understanding how human impact influences the spread of resistance genes. An effect of the introduction of high levels of human-made antibiotics in the environment is the promotion of antibiotic resistance even in the absence of natural antibiotic production. Secondary stress conditions like heavy metal pollution cause higher HGT as a stress response, which also likely contributes to the dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes. Also, rapid increase in human populations without adequate wastewater treatment allows for more chance for human pathogens to be in contact with environmental resistance-carrying bacteria, so it's important to look to wastewater treatment as a source of HGT.  Infection resistance  The resistome also refers to an inherited set of genes used to resist infections. This concept is also referred to as innate immunity, and resistance genes within the resistome provide different functions for immune response, and are differentially transcribed. Interestingly, in one study of Arabidopsis thaliana, activated regions on the chromosome for resistance against both bacteria and viruses are clustered together, likely meaning they are co-regulated. Comparing different mutations in the germline can be used to help define the size and position of the resistome, this set of genes conferring an inherited immune response. Because of mutation, the ‚Äòuniversal resistome‚Äô, a set of resistance genes shared among all mice, similar to the concept of the pan-microbiome, is likely extremely small.

A MILS solution allows for independent evaluation of security components and trusted composition. MILS builds on the older Bell and La Padula theories on secure systems that represent the foundational theories of the DoD Orange Book. A MILS system employs one or more separation mechanisms (e.g., Separation kernel, Partitioning Communication System, physical separation) to maintain assured data and process separation. A MILS system supports enforcement of one or more application/system specific security policies by authorizing information flow only between components in the same security domain or through trustworthy security monitors (e.g., access control guards, downgraders, crypto devices, etc.). Properties: * Non-bypassable: a component can not use another communication path, including lower level mechanisms to bypass the security monitor. * Evaluatable: any trusted component can be evaluated to the level of assurance required of that component. This means the components are modular, well designed, well specified, well implemented, small, low complexity, etc. * Always-invoked: each and every access/message is checked by the appropriate security monitors (i.e., a security monitor will not just check on a first access and then pass all subsequent accesses/messages through). * Tamperproof: the system controls \\"modify\\" rights to the security monitor code, configuration and data; preventing unauthorized changes. A convenient acronym for these characteristics is NEAT.

Luke fragment, in two parts, is preserved in the Laurentian Library collection in Florence (PSI 1.2 + PSI 2.124), and the Matthew fragment is in the Berlin State Museum (P. 11863).Karl Jaro≈° (2006). Das Neue Testament nach den √§ltesten griechischen Handschriften. CD-ROM.  Description  Uncial 0171 measures 5.7 cm by 9.2 cm from a page of two columns of 23 lines. The scribe wrote in a reformed documentary hand.Philip W Comfort and David P Barrett, The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts, (Wheaton, Illinois: Tyndale House Publishers Incorporated, 2001), 684-691. It has errors of itacism, the nomina sacra are contracted (ŒöŒ£, ŒôŒóŒ£). Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ is uncontracted. Luke 22:51 and 22:62 are omitted. The Alands describe the text as \\"an early (secondary?) form of the D [Codex Bezae] text\\" and \\"paraphrastic\\". Uncial 0171 is an important witness to the existence of the Western text-type in Egypt.Bruce Manning Metzger, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, 4th edition, (New York City: Oxford University Press, 2005). Aland placed it in Category IV. It is the earliest Greek witness with text of Luke 22:43‚Äì44. It is classed as a \\"consistently cited witness of the first order\\" in Nestle-Aland's Novum Testamentum Graece.Eberhard Nestle, Erwin Nestle, Barbara Aland and Kurt Aland (eds), Novum Testamentum Graece, 27th edition, (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2001), 58. Its 27th edition (NA27) considers it even more highly than other witnesses of this type. It provides an exclamation mark (!) for \\"papyri and uncial manuscripts of particular significance because of their age.\\" The manuscript was found in 1903‚Äì1905 in Hermopolis Magna.James Neville Birdsall, A Fresh Examination of the Fragments of the Gospel of St. Luke in MS. 0171 and an Attempted Reconstruction with Special Reference to the Recto. The text was first published by the Societ√† Italiana in Florence in 1912. Hermann von Soden knew the first fragment only in time to include it in the list of addenda in 1913. He classified it within his ŒôŒ± text.Hermann von Soden, Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments (G√∂ttingen 1913), pp. 895, 903‚Äì904. Marie-Joseph Lagrange gave a collation, he classifies the fragment in his \\"recension D\\", and argues that the divergences of the fragment from the Codex Bezae are due to idiosyncrasies either of that manuscript or of the fragment itself.M.-J. Lagrange, Critique textuelle II, La Critique rationelle (Paris, 1935), pp. 71-76. Kurt Treu identified the Matthew and Luke portions as the work of the same scribe on the same codex.Kurt Treu, Archiv f√ºr Papyrusforschung 18 (1966): 25-28. Later again, Neville Birdsall observed that a lower portion of the manuscript had been overlooked in the editio princeps.J. Neville Birdsall, 'A fresh examination of the fragments of the gospel of St. Luke in Ms. 0171 and an attempted reconstruction with special reference to the recto', in Roger Gryson (editor), Philologia Sacra: Biblische und patristische Studien f√ºr Hermann J Frede und :de:Walter Thiele zu ihrem siebzigsten Geburtstag, Vetus Latina 24, (Freiburg: Herder, 1993), 212-217.

He resided in Los Angeles, California with his wife, the former model/actress Joyce Ingalls (whom he married in 1984; a marriage lasting until her death),https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/joyce-ingalls- actress-and-former-model-dies-at-65/ar-BBlTKCS?li=BBgzzfc&ocid;=U142DHP and continues to work in film, television, and theater. Background Darrell Fetty was born in Milton, West Virginia and attended one of the last one-room schoolhouses in America at Ball's Gap, West Virginia. He graduated from Milton High School and Marshall University, both located in West Virginia. As a kid, he got his first role in a church play with his parents. He started piano lessons in the third grade, and, a couple of years later, began playing for the church choir. In his teens, Fetty put several rock bands together. With the help of his guitarist friend Yancey Burns, he formed The Satisfied Minds and they released one single on Plato Records. TV and film career Moving to Los Angeles after college graduation, Fetty landed his first role on the then-popular high school drama Room 222 and began acting regularly in television and feature films. His TV appearances include guest-starring roles on Happy Days, Starsky & Hutch, Barnaby Jones, The Facts of Life, One Day at a Time, Eight is Enough, Kojak, The Streets of San Francisco, thirtysomething, CHiPs, Knots Landing, The Gangster Chronicles, Centennial and Hawaii 5-0. Among his theatrical movies were featured roles in Stunts and Blood Beach. Fetty co-starred in the John Milius films Big Wednesday as a surfer called \\"Waxer\\" and in The Wind and the Lion as a bumbling junior diplomat. He played Donald Haines in the 2017 TV film Dating Game Killer. Life as a writer During the early days of his acting career, Darrell Fetty supplemented his income as a Story Analyst, reviewing screenplays for studios and independent producers, starting at American International Pictures for the legendary Sam Arkoff. At this time Fetty was also writing music videos for MTV, working with young directors for such artists as The Ramones and Jefferson Starship. He wrote a number of independent features including Freeway and Trouble Bound, co-written with Francis Delia; State Park (under the pseudonym \\"Neal M. Noble\\"), and Into The Fire (as \\"Jesse Ballard\\") and worked extensively in feature development for most of the major studios with such producers as Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer, and John Milius. In the late 1990s, he began working full-time as a writer/producer for TV shows, beginning as a staff writer on NBC's Viper, created by Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo. Fetty's other series work include The Sentinel, Silk Stalkings, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Pensacola: Wings of Gold, and Mutant X. Personal life Darrell Fetty first married Carolyne McCoy, who is a descendant of the famous feuding families (her mother was a Hatfield, her father a McCoy). Fetty married his second wife, former model turned actress Joyce Ingalls, at a ceremony at the Little Brown Church in Studio City in 1984. The couple oversaw the Little Brown Church's homeless ministry and operated the church food pantry, now called the Darrell and Joyce Fetty Food Pantry, for nearly 25 years. Their food pantry is estimated to have served thousands of families. They have two children. Joyce Ingalls died on August 5, 2015, at the age of 65. Darrell Fetty is a close friend of writer/director John Milius, whom he considers a mentor and major influence in his career.

It called on the French government, then headed by the Gaullist Michel Debr√©, and public opinion to recognise the Algerian War as a legitimate struggle for independence, denouncing the use of torture by the French army, and calling for French conscientious objectors to the conflict to be respected by the authorities. The Declaration was drafted by Dionys Mascolo, Maurice Blanchot and Jean Schuster. It stated that the cause of the Algerians was the cause of all free men, and that the struggle was striking a decisive blow to the cause of colonialism.

Shippen was born in Philadelphia, the son of merchant Edward Shippen III. He learned law from Tench Francis, Pennsylvania's attorney general. He married his mentor's daughter Margaret Francis in 1753, with whom he had nine children. In 1748 he went to London to complete his law studies at the Middle Temple, and, after returning to Philadelphia, was admitted to the bar. He was appointed judge of the admiralty court in 1755. Three years later he was elected to the city's common council. In 1762 he was appointed prothonotary of the supreme court, a post retained till the Revolution. He became a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Council in 1770. Shippen attempted to stay neutral in the American Revolution, hoping that the colonies and the mother country would be reconciled. He did not support the extension of royal authority and was therefore not a Loyalist, but he also opposed the radically democratic Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which sought to reduce the hold on government by powerful families like the Shippens. He received in 1790 an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, of which he was a trustee from 1791 until his death. He was also a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1791, he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, serving with Jasper Yeates and Edward Burd, both kinsmen and former students. Shippen became chief justice in 1799, but in 1804 was impeached on flimsy, political grounds. The next year the Pennsylvania Senate acquitted him and his associates. Shippen retired to private life and died soon thereafter, on April 15, 1806 in Philadelphia at age 77. His fourth daughter, Margaret Shippen, was the second wife of Benedict Arnold.

Before becoming CAD Director, Ang had assisted the Commission of Inquiry into the death of National Development Minister Teh Cheang Wan, who committed suicide in the midst of corruption investigations. He also was the Deputy Public Prosecutor in the trial of Francis Seow. In Seow's trial, lawyer V. K. Dube complained that Ang had misconducted himself by making remarks which were \\"unwarranted, baseless and untrue.\\" The Law Society fined Ang S$1,000 but he appealed to the High Court, which waived the fine after deciding that the Law Society had no jurisdiction to discipline Ang because he did not have a practising certificate, even though he was an advocate and solicitor. On appeal to the Singapore Court of Appeal, the Court decided that because Ang was an advocate and solicitor, the jurisdiction of the Law Society did extend to him notwithstanding his lack of a practicing certificate: however, on the facts they did not uphold the fine.Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong Lawrence [1992] 3 SLR(R) 825; [1992] SGCA 86 During his time as CAD Director, Ang headed the prosecution for cases such as that of former Member of Parliament Choo Wee Khiang and Barings Bank trader Nick Leeson.

There are several references to teams from the parish affiliating on and off over the years. In the 1950 and '60's Annaghdown had very strong hurling teams winning several North Board Junior Championships but never actually winning out the County Junior Championship proper. In the early '60's Annaghdown entered the Intermediate Championship and almost went Senior in the mid-sixties, but, due to retirements and emigration, they resorted to the Junior grade after a few years. In the 1970s, Brother Vincent, a monk who taught in Corrandulla school, and a native of Kilkenny, started juvenile coaching and this work saw Annaghdown win several underage titles in the '80's, culminating in the winning of the 1980 Feile na Gael All-Ireland U14 title. The work started by Brother Vincent was continued by Bernard Naughton who set up hurling in the GAA club which was dominated by football before this originally from Turloughmore, and it has seen Annaghdown being competitive at underage since. In the last decade Annaghdown‚Äôs fortunes have improved at adult level with the club's top hurling team now trading its wares in the highly competitive Intermediate grade, reaching the semi-final for the first time in 2008. At present there is a very strong cohort of people taking charge of underage teams in the club, fielding teams from U-8 right up to Intermediate level.

Sir George Bullough, 1st Baronet (28 February 1870 ‚Äì 26 July 1939) was a late Victorian playboy and was an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Accrington, Lancashire, George Bullough was educated at Harrow School. In 1891 the 21-year-old George Bullough and half-brother Ian each inherited a half interest in Howard & Bullough, their father's successful textile machinery manufacturing company. As well, George inherited the island of R√πm, the family's sporting estate in the Inner Hebrides where he would build Kinloch Castle between 1898 and 1901. In 1903, George Bullough married Monique Lilly de la Pasture whose family had an estate at Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France. Known as Lady Monica, she obtained a divorce in order to marry Bullough. She was the eldest daughter of the Fourth Marquis de la Pasture whose aristocrat ancestors had fled the French Revolution and Leontine Standish (1843-1869), daughter of Lord Charles Strickland Standish (1790-1863).Countess Leontine de la Pasture (1843-1869) born Standish They had one daughter, Hermione (born 5 November 1906 - died 27 October 1990), who married John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. Other than the income it provided, George Bullough had little interest in the family business. With his wealth, he chose to pursue an interest in yachting and thoroughbred horse racing as well as hunting, serving as Master of the Ledbury Foxhounds from 1908 through 1921. He acquired an ocean-going steam-powered yacht, Rhouma, in which he travelled extensively. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Bullough converted his yacht to a hospital ship and sailed it to South Africa for service. [The Graphic 8 December 1900 p864 has pictures] As a result of his support of the war effort, in December 1901 he was knighted by King Edward VII. He also donated the Bullough Cup for competition in shinty in Argyll and Lorn, this trophy is still played for today. In 1909, Sir George Bullough purchased the Down House, Redmarley, where he moved his stud, consequently breeding well-known horses such as Ethnarch, Grand Vitesse, Valois and Ellanvale on the premises. In 1913, he purchased a 1902 steel yacht, also named Rhouma, which was hired to the Royal Navy as an auxiliary patrol yacht during World War I. Bullough served as a cavalry officer with the Imperial Yeomanry from 1908 to 1911 and because of his horsemanship, during World War I he was appointed a superintendent with the Remount Department with the rank of major. For his services to his country, George Bullough was created a baronet \\"of the island of R√πm and of Down House in the parish of Redmarley in the County of Worcester\\" on 21 January 1916. = Thoroughbred horse racing = Kinloch Castle, built by George Bullough in 1900 An avid sportsman, Sir George Bullough had a lifelong interest in horses. Interested in Thoroughbred racing, he eventually became a member of the National Hunt Committee and a member of the Jockey Club. He developed a significant racing stable that had its first major success in steeplechase with Ballymacad which won the 1917 War National, ran at Gatwick racecourse in place of the Grand National. Investing in flat racing Thoroughbreds, his Irish-bred colt Golden Myth won several important English races including the 1922 Ascot Gold Cup and Eclipse Stakes. When Golden Myth retired to stud, Bullough teamed up with prominent trainer John L. Jarvis to establish Longholes Stud near Newmarket. In 1934, they won an English Classic when Campanula captured the 1,000 Guineas. =Death= Sir George Bullough died in 1939 while playing golf in France. He was buried alongside his father John Bullough in the family mausoleum at Harris on the west coast of R√πm.

Her life was not geared towards faith in her childhood until the reception of her First Communion which seemed to transform her into a pious and discerning individual; she likewise experienced a sudden conversion after hearing a sermon that led her to found an order dedicated to the education of the poor. However, her religious life was not without its own set of trials, for complications prevented her order from receiving full pontifical approval due to a select few causing problems as well as the deaths of many followers from tuberculosis in the beginning of the order's life. Her beatification was celebrated under Pope Paul VI in 1975 while her canonization was later celebrated on 3 June 2007 under Pope Benedict XVI. Life Anne-Eug√©nie Milleret de Brou was born during the night of 25 August 1817 in Metz as one of five children (three males and two females) to Jacques Milleret and Eleonore-Eug√©nie de Brou. Her baptism was celebrated on 5 October. Her father was a follower of Voltaire and a liberal which often put him into conflict with his diminishing faith. He made his fortune from banking and politics. Her parents met in Luxembourg when her father was 19 and her mother 22; the two married soon after. In 1822 her brother Charles (1813-1822) died and her little sister Elizabeth died in 1823. She had two older brothers, Eugene (b. 1802) and Louis (b. 1815-16). One distant ancestor was the Italian condottieri Miglioretti who served Francis I. Young Milleret de Brou grew up in a chateau in the suburb of Priesch north of Paris. When she was 13, her father lost all his money and the family estate. Her parents separated in 1830 as a result of her father's financial misfortunes, and she moved to Paris with her mother while her brother Louis moved with their father. Milleret de Brou had a deep concern for the poor and tended to poor families; she often accompanied her mother visiting those poor families in need. Milleret de Brou's mother died of cholera in 1832, after a short period of illness, and she spent the remainder of her teens between two sets of relations. On one side she found her family concerned with material pleasures, while the other demonstrated a narrow spirit of piousness. Separated from the brother who had been her main companion as a child, she wondered about life and how to live out the spirit of faith and justice that her mother had taught her. In 1825 she made a pilgrimage to the shrine of Sainte-Anne d'Auray where she felt called to found a religious order dedicated to educating the poor. On 25 December 1829, Christmas day, she took her First Communion and it proved to be a life-changing experience for her. Through the reception of this sacrament she experienced the presence of God - a profound spiritual moment - which proved to be one about which she would refer to the rest of her life. During Lent in 1836 Milleret de Brou was invited to listen to a series of lectures at the Notre Dame cathedral at 10:00am which the then-Abb√© Lacordaire, a famous preacher and social commentator, gave. His preaching lead her to have a profound conversion experience, and she became passionate about the messages from the Gospel and thus a dedicated servant to God. In July 1837 she returned to her father and brother whom she had not seen since her parents separated; she announced to them that she wanted to become a religious sister and she was heartbroken that her father and brother Louis found this dream incomprehensible. She made a brief novitiate with the Sisters of the Visitation on 15 August 1838 before leaving. She went to confession to the Abb√© Th√©odore Combalot, who told her that he was looking for someone to help him found a religious order devoted to the Blessed Mother and the education of the poor.He believed that she would be such a founder capable of seeing out his vision. On 30 April 1839 Milleret de Brou founded the Religious of the Assumption with four companions. The congregation began in a small apartment on the Rue Ferou in Paris and celebrated their first Mass together as a religious congregation on 9 November 1839. In March 1841 she was made the Superior of the order and held the position until she resigned due to ill health in 1894. On 14 August 1841 she made her initial vows and then made her perpetual profession on 25 December 1844. In May 1866 Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus set off for Rome and visited the tomb of Saint Peter before setting off to visit the catacombs and other Roman churches, and then attending Mass in the room where Saint Ignatius of Loyola died. On 31 May she had a private audience with Pope Pius IX. Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus returned to Rome where on 11 April 1888 Pope Leo XIII issued pontifical approval to her order and signed the decree in her presence. In 1893, Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus returned to Rome and met Leo XIII again. In 1894 she attempted to return to Rome but had to stop in Genoa due to falling ill en route. In late 1894 she visited Madrid and San Sebasti√°n. In March 1895 she went with her nurse Sister Marie Michel to Rome and made stops along the train to Montpellier and Nice as well as to Cannes and Genoa; she returned to France three months later. The aging nun suffered a small stroke in October 1897 which caused her speech to slow; her legs began to grow frail and movement became more difficult over time. Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus died on 10 March 1898 at 3:00am; she received the Viaticum on 9 March and received the Last Rites on 13 February when it seemed she would die despite her bouncing back from that scare. The Cardinal Archbishop of Reims Beno√Æt-Marie Lang√©nieux celebrated her funeral on 12 March. As of 2019 her order had 1300 followers from 44 different nationalities, operating in 34 countries on four continents.\\"St Marie-Eug√©nie de J√©sus, 10th March\\", Diocese of Shrewsbury, March 4, 2017 Sainthood The sainthood process opened in the Paris archdiocese in an informative process that Cardinal Jean Verdier oversaw from 1934 until its closure in 1936; her writings received theological approval on two separate occasions on 1 February 1939 and on 8 July 1949. The formal introduction to the cause came on 17 April 1940 under Pope Pius XII and she became titled as a Servant of God. Cardinal Emmanuel C√©lestin Suhard oversaw the apostolic process from 1941 until 1943 before all documentation from both processes was sent to the Congregation for Rites in Rome who validated these processes on 14 December 1945. An antepreparatory committee approved the cause on 9 May 1951 as did a preparatory one (the first on 30 June 1953 was inconclusive) on 7 June 1960 and the general committee on 6 June 1961. On 21 June 1961 she became titled as Venerable after Pope John XXIII confirmed that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. Pope Paul VI beatified her on 9 February 1975 in Saint Peter's Square. The miracle for canonization was opened and closed in 2003 in the Manila archdiocese while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 30 April 2004. Medical experts approved this miracle on 27 January 2005 as did the theologians on 14 February 2006 and the C.C.S. members on 12 December 2006. Pope Benedict XVI approved this miracle on 16 December 2006 and formalized the date for the canonization on 23 February 2007 at a consistory; Benedict XVI canonized her on 3 June 2007. =Miracle= The canonization miracle was the healing of Risa Bondoc (b. February 1995) who had a condition from her birth that prevented the two halves of her brain from joining. Her mother - who did not know of this condition - had put Risa up for adoption and so Ditos and Carmen Bondoc adopted her and had taken her to specialists, to no avail.

They last appeared in the final in 1997. They are third in the all-time list of most victories. They had two great decades, the first coming from 1900 to 1912, and the 1960s when they won five of the ten championships. They contributed five players to the great Galway Three-in-a-Row team of 1964,65 and 66. They included John Keenan, John Donnellan, For the first time since 1973, the club secured its first county Galway Minor Championship in September 2012 with a 2-10 to 2-06 victory over St James'. This was a momentous occasion and this group of talented youngsters could provide the bedrock for a successful and bright period for the club in the coming years. Notable players *Michael Donnellan was a talented footballer and won an All-Ireland medal with the Galway Senior football team in 1925. He died in Croke Park at the 1964 All- Ireland final, shortly before his son, John Donnellan, as victorious Galway captain, received the Sam Maguire Cup. John would follow in his father's footsteps in both football and political pursuits. He captained the Galway winning team in 1964, the first of a historic \\"3 In A Row\\". His brother, Patrick (Pateen) was also on the team. *John's son Michael, kept the family tradition alive by winning two All-Ireland titles in 1998 and 2001. He was one of the most exciting players of his time but he never enjoyed similar success with Dunmore. Armagh footballing great Ois√≠n McConville once said of him \\"He was the best athlete I've ever played against\\". His capabilities were never more evident than in the All-Ireland final of 1998 where his surging runs and skilful ball-carrying were crucial to the team's victory. His stunning run of the full length of the pitch to assist Se√°n √ìg de Paor was voted the best moment in the history of GAA.

Conconi is a Professor at the University of Ferrara in Italy where he heads the Centro Studi Biomedici Applicati allo Sport or Biomedical Research Institute. His research focused on tracing techniques for doping substances but he is better known for his doping activities and is said to have introduced Erythropoietin or EPO to the sport of cycling. Conconi is most famous for having prepared Francesco Moser for his successful attempt to break the world hour record in Mexico, 1984. History It was on 14 August 1980 that Conconi submitted a proposal to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) proposing that selected Italian athletes be assisted by staff of the University to improve their performance. Conconi proposed that he help athletes in the sports of cycling, canoeing, rowing, long distance skiing, speed skating, swimming and wrestling. CONI accepted the offer. According to Sandro Donati, a coach of the middle distance running team from 1981 onwards, this method of preparation was blood doping. Professor Conconi approached Donati regarding improving the performances of his athletes with estimations of the improvements at 3 to 5 seconds for 1,500 metre races, 15 to 20 seconds for 5,000 metre races and 30 to 40 seconds for 10,000 metre races. There was a partnership between the Olympic Committee and Professor Conconi's biomedical research centre at the University of Ferrara and the Olympic Committee financed his research. According to Donati, Professor Conconi together with the Italian Athletics Federation and a major Italian Research Institute administered testosterone and anabolic steroids to athletes for events in the 1980s. Over several years, CONI funded the research of Conconi with over two million euros. The work of Conconi and his many assistants at the Ferrara University produced great results in sport. In the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Italy won 34 medals. Many of the athletes had hematocrit levels of over 50%. =Conconi test and Francesco Moser= Conconi together with his assistants including Michele Ferrari prepared Francesco Moser in his attempt to break the World Hour Record in January 1984. Conconi theorized that heart rate could be correlated with perceived exertion in order to allow Moser to cycle at the absolute maximum of his capability. Conconi found a point at which aerobic efficiency was overcome by accumulation of lactic acid. At this \\"threshold\\" level, the ability of the athlete to sustain a maximum effort would be compromised. Conconi then set about developing a method to extend the \\"Anaerobic Threshold.\\" Putting [heart] into your workout Conconi developed The Conconi test, which is also known as the ramp test, which measures heart rate at different predefined intensity levels.The Conconi Test The Conconi Point is the point of maximal steady stateU.S. Cross Country Ski Team Field Method or maximum heart rate a subject can have.What is the Conconi Test? Professor Conconi was a great innovator in sports science and in his preparation of Moser. This preparation included blood doping, as Moser would later admit. Conconi wrote a book about preparing Moser called Moser's Hour Records: A Human and Scientific Adventure() in 1991. Ten years after breaking the Hour record, Conconi coached Moser to attempt to break the record a second time. This idea came from a gentleman's bet between the two to see if Moser under the guidance of Conconi would be able to break his 1984 record ten years later. Moser was 43 years of age when he rode 51.840 kilometers in 60 minutes thereby riding 689 meters beyond his record set in 1984. =Introduction of EPO to cycling= At the Winter Olympics in 1994 in Lillehammer, Conconi gave a talk to members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and informed them about his work on an EPO test. He described how he had carried out controlled experiments with 23 amateur triathletes and other athletes with EPO treatments but that he had not come up with a test to detect EPO use. The details of Conconi's subjects were later discovered by police after a raid at the University of Ferrara and revealed to be not amateurs but elite professionals, six of which were from the cycling team. Conconi had listed subjects' names, gender, sport, date of analysis as well as whether or not they were treated with EPO. Despite funding by CONI and the IOC to come up with an EPO detection test, Conconi was using the money to buy the drug and then administered it to athletes who were also paying Conconi. Conconi is said to have made a technique to balance EPO, Blood Thinner and Human Growth Hormone in a mixture that Athletes could take safely and pass doping tests without testing positive. With this ability to safely take EPO, Donati estimated that 60 to 70% of the peloton used EPO in the mid-1990s. The team doctor of the Carrera cycling team, Dr. Giovanni Grazzi, worked with Conconi at the University in 1993 while the following year, 1994, another professional cycling team, , were connected to Conconi via doctors Michele Ferrari and Ilario Casoni. In addition a number of well known cycling stars were clients of the Institute. The Gewiss team attracted a lot of negative attention when after taking the whole podium in the La Fl√®che Wallonne Classic in 1994, Ferrari in an interview with the French sports newspaper L'√âquipe was acritical of the drug. He claimed that EPO had no \\"fundamental\\" effect on performance and that if a rider used it wouldn't \\"scandalize\\" himself. He also claimed EPO was not dangerous, only abuse of it was dangerous, saying \\"It's also dangerous to drink 10 liters of orange juice.\\" The 'orange juice' comment has been widely misquoted.Interview with Michele Ferrari, by Jean-Michel Rouet, from l'Equipe, 1994, reprinted excerpt quoted in Cycling News, An Interview With Dr. Michele Ferrari, part two , 2003, Tim Maloney / Cyclingnews European Editor10 liters of orange juice: see the article on Water intoxication, for example. Bjarne Riis the 1996 Tour de France winner was a rider of the Gewiss team and was treated with EPO in 1994 and 1995 in Conconi's Institute in Ferrara. During the 1996 season Riis was coached with one of Conconi's assistants Cecchini and would win the Tour de France. It would be reported in the Rome-based newspaper, La Repubblica, in January 2000 that Conconi was involved with administering EPO to riders on the Carrera. In March 2000 the Italian Judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the conclusions of an investigation into a number of sports doctors including Professor Conconi. This official judicial investigation concluded that the riders of the Carrera team were administered EPO in 1993. The riders included Stephen Roche, Claudio Chiappucci, Guido Bontempi, Rolf S√∏rensen, Mario Chiesa, Massimo Ghirotto and Fabio Roscioli. Files seized as part of the judicial investigation allegedly detail a number of aliases for former Tour de France, Giro d'Italia winner and World Champion Stephen Roche including Rocchi, Rossi, Rocca, Roncati, Righi and Rossini. In 1997, Claudio Chiappucci told prosecutor Vincenzo Scolastico that he had been using EPO since 1993, but later he recalled that statement.Vrijgesproken Conconi moreel veroordeeld door Italiaanse gerecht Marco Pantani was part of the team and his hematocrit level displayed rises and falls which looked very suspicious. On October 18, 1995 Pantani was taken to hospital after an accident in the Milano‚ÄìTorino race where a hematocrit percentage of 60.1% whereas in the previous June it had been 45%. At this time there was no limit to the hematocrit level but the large fluctuation was suspicious. Appointment to Medical Committee of CONI Alexandre de Merode, a former President of the IOC's Medical Committee appointed Conconi as a member of the medical committee and funded Conconi's alleged research into a test to detect the use of EPO. During this time the President of CONI from 1993 to 1998, Dr. Mario Pescante, suppressed a report by Donati which indicated Conconi's involvement in doping. Investigations In 1999 the investigations into the doping activities of Conconi began. About twenty doctors and researchers from Conconi's biomedical research centre were under investigation. In an investigation in front of Judge Piero Messini D'Agostini two hematologists submitted a report in which they concluded that the blood values of athletes treated by Conconi indicated doping. In 2000 Italian public prosecutor Pierguido Soprani alleged that Conconi drugged himself. This was because Conconi at the age of 59 recorded a hematocrit value of 57% while competing in a mountain bike race on 3 September 1994. Computer files of Conconi that were seized in the investigation were later reported about in the press. These files were for patients of Conconi and included Ivan Gotti, Pavel Tonkov, Abraham Olano, Marco Pantani, Tony Rominger, Gianluca Bortolami and Giorgio Furlan. These files showed hematocrit variations in individuals during treatments. Tonkov's hematocrit went from 51.5% in June, 1996 to 40.9% in September. Ivan Gotti's hematocrit went from 35.2% in January 1997 to 50.7% in June 1998. Marco Pantani's level went from 40.7 in March 1994 to 58% in June and July 1994. During the 1995 Tour de France, Pantani had a level of 56% and after his accident in Milano‚ÄìTorino it was 60%. Claudio Chiappucci had a hematocrit level of 35% in January 1994 to 60% in June, 1994 after he came fifth in the 1994 Giro d'Italia. In 2004 Judge Oliva alleged that the athletes treated at the Institute indeed had taken EPO during the 1993 season but due to the statute of limitations, none would be prosecuted. The Judge found Conconi 'morally guilty'.http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2004/mar04/mar20news1 Judge calls Italian professor \\"morally guilty\\" The judge had looked at medical reports of 33 cyclists in the period 1993-1995, including Chiappucci's, and all blood tests showed largely fluctuating hematocrit-values, indicative for EPO-use.Conconi vrijgesproken na proces van vijf jaar  Assistants at the Biomedical Research Centre at Ferrara University Conconi had many assistants (doctors and researchers) with whom he performed his tests. Several of these would be charged in connection with doping activities or would continue working as sports scientists after leaving the Institute.

The company's central technology was based on the Wave Energy Converter \\"WEC\\" which converts wave energy into electrical energy. Oceanlinx technology focused on the oscillating water column principle, and developed several prototype generators which were deployed and tested in Port Kembla, New South Wales. In 2014, Oceanlinx entered receivership and its technology, intellectual property, brand and trademark were sold to Wave Power Renewables Limited in Hong Kong. Wave Power Renewables Limited has continued to develop the technology, and Oceanlinx's founding director, Tom Denniss has further developed the technology since 2016 as a director of Wave Swell Energy.  Technology  The wave energy conversion technology developed by Energetech and later Oceanlinx uses a bi-directional airflow air turbine, turbine installed on top of an oscillating water column; this turbine concept and others were developed specifically by Oceanlinx to accommodate waver energy conversion technology. The Turbine and generator are the only moving part and sit above the water. The advantage is that fewer the moving parts the better and it means that the turbine is not in direct contact with the sea water. =Oscillating Water Column & Turbines= Oscillating Water Columns (OWCs) are simple constructions that act like a piston and cylinder. As waves rise within the OWC, it replicates the action of a piston, driving a column of air ahead of it and through the turbine. Most turbines are designed to function with a constant flow in a single direction but OWC generates a bi-directional flow. Oceanlinx patented turbines can continue to generate electricity regardless of a change of direction under varying flow conditions. =Generator and Transmission System= The system will be matched to the turbine based on the available wave resource. The rated capacity of the generator will vary to best match the environmental conditions at the installed location. The firm was developing deep-water technology to generate electricity from easy-to-predict long-wavelength ocean swell oscillations.  History  = Energetech (1997‚Äì2006) = Energetech was founded in 1997 by Dr. Tom Denniss as Energetech Australia Pty Ltd. During its 17-year life, it attracted approximately AUD$6.9 million in grant funding. In 1999 the company received an AUD$750,000 Federal Government Grant to develop a wave energy project at Port Kembla in New South Wales. In 2001 Energetech closed a round of venture capital funding with the Connecticut Clean Energy fund in the United States. This allowed the company to establish a US subsidiary: Energetech America. The following year, four European companies invested US$4.5 million. In 2003 a major milestone was reached with the construction and successful testing of the first full-scale Denniss-Auld turbine. Energetech America received grant funding of US$750,000 from two state renewable funds for the development and construction of a wave energy project in Rhode Island, USA. In 2004, Energetech was awarded a AUD$1.21 million research and development grant by the Australian Government to facilitate its Wave Energy Optimisation program. Tom Engelsman joined Energetech as Chief Executive Officer appointed by the Board and replacing Dr. Tom Denniss. In 2005, Energetech launched an Industry Advisory Service division, and attracted further investment of AUD$500,000 from the Centre for Energy and Greenhouse Technologies. In 2006, Energetech completed the installation of the Port Kembla MK1 prototype wave energy plant. The plant operated successfully for three years. = Oceanlinx (2007‚Äì2014) = Energetech changed its name to Oceanlinx in 2007. The following year, David Weaver was appointed as CEO, replacing Tom Engelsman. In 2009 Ali Baghaei was appointed CEO and MD and the MK1 prototype at Port Kembla was decommissioned.  MK3 Prototype  In 2010, the MK3 prototype was launched at Port Kembla and was successfully grid- connected for the first time. It was designed to generate 2.5MW of electricity. In May 2010 it broke free of its moorings and sank at the bottom of Port Kembla's eastern breakwater. Plans to remove the generator were delayed by years, exacerbated by the company entering receivership in April 2014. In December 2011, the Kilpatrick Group was engaged to remove the wave generator. In July 2012, Oceanlinx CEO Ali Baghaei said that a new contractor had been awarded the work, and that it would be removed within months. In March 2013, Roads and Maritime Services announced their intention sue Oceanlinx for failing to remove the generator. The action was dropped after an agreement of cooperation was reached with Oceanlinx. In July 2013, Oceanlinx's chairman Tibor Vertes said that Oceanlinx would attempt to remove the generator by the end of the year.The Illawarra-based contractor Blue Sky Services was appointed to remove the wave generator in late 2013. The removal of the structure was undertaken in two phases, beginning in October 2016. The second phase involved refloating the remains of the structure and towing it 50 nautical miles offshore before scuttling it in June 2017.  GreenWAVE prototype  In 2012, Oceanlinx attracted funding to further develop its technology under the name GreenWAVE. The development of the GreenWAVE prototype was funded by the Australian Government (approx. AUD$4.4 million) and private investment (approx. AUD $3.6 million). The Australian public funding was provided by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency under the Emerging Renewables Program. The prototype device with a generating capacity of 1MW was completed and unveiled in October 2013. It measured 24 metres long by 21 metres wide and weighed 3,000 tonnes. The structure was designed to have no moving parts below the water line to require no mooring or anchorage. It was intended to sit 4 kilometres offshore from Port Macdonnell, where it would provide electricity for local consumption via a deal with Diamond Energy. In 2014, the four-day journey to tow the GreenWAVE prototype into place at Port Macdonnell began. The unit was damaged during the tow and sank to the seabed near Carrickalinga, South Australia where it remains stranded. The incident led the company into receivership and the prototype was abandoned by the appointed manager. As of 2020, residents of Carrickalinga continue to lobby the Government of South Australia to remove the structure.  Receivership and intellectual property  Following the GreenWAVE accident, Oceanlinx entered receivership in 2014. The technology, IP, brand and trademark were sold to Wave Power Renewables Limited. In 2016, inventor Tom Denniss and founding director of Oceanlinx (as Energetech Australia Pty Ltd) established the new public, unlisted Australian company Wave Swell Energy to commercialise his Oscillating Water Column wave generation technology.

History Its construction was completed in 1973 by Civil & Civic, and it remains the tallest building in Canberra. This title is soon to be replaced by the \\"High Society\\" development in Belconnen, slated to be completed by September 2020. Shortly after its opening, in 1974, there was an incident where a gunman of indigenous background held four public servants part of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs at gunpoint, as a result armed guards were posted in the lobby for the next few months. It became apparent during construction that the tower formed a kind of wind tunnel with the plaza below, and in 1975 the NCDC proposed building a clock tower to combat the problem while simultaneously telling the time. This project never progressed passed wind tunnel tests. In 1984 the tower operators were fined $852 for breaches of the 1962 Companies Ordinance. Later that year it was found that the tower had major flaws in its fire evacuation procedure after a false alarm. At the time the building had no fire suppression systems, no visible or audible alarms, or any way of detecting or alerting fires. These safety features were added to the building shortly after, however it was also discovered that ACT Fire and Rescue was unable to properly respond to high rise fires, owning no extendable ladders. In 1994 the building was bought by E.C. Managed Investments Group and then sold on to BZW Investment Management Group for A$47.5 million. The Lovett Tower is a landmark commercial office, refurbished in 1999 and in 2007, and can be seen towering over the city far away from Canberra. It was formerly known as the MLC Tower but was renamed in 2000 by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to honour the Lovett family. Features The Lovett Tower is the 3rd tallest structure in Canberra (behind Black Mountain Tower and the flagpole of Parliament House) but is the tallest building because it has the most storeys - 26 storeys high including a basement level (though it is merely the 258th tallest building in Australia), and it also has the height of 93 metres (305 ft). The Tower is currently occupied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. However, the tower faces problems, as the building faces vacancy by 2016, as well as the departments occupying the building are cutting jobs in the hundreds. As such there is no public access to the building. On the ground floor however, are shopfronts, housing a credit union (on the eastern side) and a coffee shop (on the western side). there is restricted access to the 13th floor, including no 13th floor button in most of the lifts, as the floor houses the building plant. The tower has been considered to be reinvented as an aged-care facility after the departments currently occupying the tower move elsewhere. Accommodation of the building consists of a single level basement, ground floor foyer, two ground floor tenancies, while the rest of the building mainly consists of office space. A mezzanine level is also found in the building. Upper levels of the building feature a central service core which accommodates female and male amenities, tea rooms, and multiple lifts and lift lobbies. The Woden Town Centre is notorious for the wind tunnel caused by the Lovett Tower.

Prominently seen on the Lord and his consorts are the Pavitra garlands Pavitrotsavam is an annual ritual in the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Andhra Pradesh. Pavitrotsava is derived from the combination of two words Pavitra (holy) and utsava (festival). This utsava is penitential as well as propitiatory and its main objective is to get rid of the evil that might have been caused due to omissions and commissions in the performance of various rituals throughout the year. The festival is also known as Dosha Nivaarana (error correction),Sarva Yajna Phalapradha (The One ritual that equals the holiness of rites all year long),Sarva Doshopasamana (Removal of all errors), Sarva Tushtikara, Sarvakaamapradha, Sarvalokasantida. Reference to holy scripts The Jayakhya Samhita explains that pavitra protects one from evil. The puranas prescribe Pavitra Aaropana (adorning the deity with pavitra - sanctified garlands of thread), as an integral part of the rituals during the worship of Lord Vishnu. The Agni Purana specifies that the first day of a lunar fortnight either in the beginning of the month of Aashada or the end of the Krithika should be chosen for performing pavitrotsava. The Garuda Purana says that this rite should be done on the 12th day of the dark or bright fortnight. Rituals Priests carrying Pavitra garlands during the Pavitrotsavam festival In Tirumala, the Pavitrotsavam ritual is conducted on Sravana shuddha dashami day. \`Ankurarpanam' or the sowing of nine type of holy seeds in earthen containers is undertaken on the day preceding the festival. This ritual signifies the beginning of festival in the temple. This is followed by recital of vedas in a ritual called Mritsangrahana. The Ankurarpana and Mritsangrahana rituals are identical to those performed during Brahmotsava. Veda recitation is started after the Mritsangrahana ritual and this recitation of the Vedas concludes on the third day. Through the chanting of the vedas, Aavahana (Invoking) is done for Lord Vishnu in the Pradhana Kumbha (first of the holy container). There are 16 other Kumbhas surrounding this Pradhana Kumbha and it is believed that the various mantras which are recited infuse voice vibrations that have great religious and spiritual force. The Pradhana khumba is taken to the main deity on the concluding day and the augmented spiritual power is believed to be transmitted to the Moola Vigraha (Kumbha Aavaahanam). The rituals on the three days include Thirumanjanam and Homam (prayer to sacrificial fire) to the main deity as well as primary idols of Lord Venkateswara. Pavitras, the garlands made from special thread are taken in a procession and used to decorate Lord Malayappa swami and his consorts on the second day. In the evening of the second day, the idols are taken on a procession around the four mada streets. During the three-day festival, Arjitha Sevas like Kalyanotsavam, Arjitha Brahmotsavam, Arjitha Vasanothsavam, Sahasara Deepalankarana Seva, Dolotsavam are cancelled while the morning rituals are held. History of festival The origin of Pavitrotsavam in Tirumala dates back to 1463 A.D. The stone inscription found on the northern wall of the Vagapadi verandah in the first Prakaara of the Tirumala temple gives a very detailed account. The festival was instituted by Saluva Malliah deva Raja during the time of Saluva Narasimha. The inscription refers even to the items of expenditure to be incurred in connection with the celebration of Pavitra Tirunal. The festival is believed to have been conducted till 1562 A.D. after which the ritual was stopped. The reason for discontinuing such an important festival is not recorded and remains unknown. TTD decided to revive the ritual that is followed in all Vishnu temples and the festival has been on the annual calendar from 1962 onwards. Devotee Participation Pavitrotsavam is an Arjita Seva - participation by payment to the Lord. TTD sells tickets to this service on the second and third days. Each ticket allows two persons and the primary ticket holder is given 10 dosas and Pongal on the second day and 10 dosas and Pongal, 6 vadas and vastram (one silk angavastram and one cotton blouse) on the third day.

History In the aftermath of a rare tornadohttp://www.erh.noaa.gov/pit/tor98.htm in 1998 that touched down in the neighborhood, the park was conceived by community activists as a way to address the damage. They called themselves \\"Green Is Good\\". They feared a post-storm \\"blighted\\" designation would spur the city to allow housing and condominium development. Although Mount Washington's vista points are a high- profile attraction, they argued, the true amenity was the continuous of green, hilly, undeveloped land that rings the Mount. Eventually \\"Green Is Good\\" won the support of Mt. Washington Community Development Corporation, other local nonprofits, and the city government.

It has no close relatives, and is now generally placed alone in family Emblingiaceae. Description It is a perennial, herbaceous prostrate subshrub, with simple petiolate leaves with \\"cartilaginous\\" (hard and tough, resembling cartilage) margins. The irregular, solitary flowers are white, cream, yellow, green or, pink, and occur from August to November. It has a non-fleshy fruit. Taxonomy The genus and species were first published in 1861 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae, based on specimens collected in the Murchison region by Pemberton Walcott and Augustus Frederick Oldfield. Placement of the genus within a family has previously been considered a difficult problem; it has at various times been placed in Capparaceae, Sapindaceae, Goodeniaceae and, in the Cronquist system, Polygalaceae. In 1965, Herbert Kenneth Airy Shaw erected Emblingiaceae for the genus, and that family is now used for the genus in the APG II, Dahlgren, Reveal, Stevens, Takhtajan and Thorne systems. Molecular analyses have confirmed the genus's placement in the Brassicales. Distribution and habitat It is endemic to Western Australia, occurring in grey, yellow or red sand, on undulating sandplains of the west coast. It is most common in the Geraldton Sandplains and Carnarvon biogeographic regions, but also occurs on the north western edge of the Avon Wheatbelt. Ecology It is not considered to be threatened.

History The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal was opened in 1772. It provided a link between the Trent and Mersey Canal at Great Haywood Junction in the north and the River Severn at Stourport in the south. A significant trade soon developed between the Potteries and the south west. to the south of the junction site, the canal was joined by the Birmingham Canal Navigations at Aldersley Junction, which provided a route for manufactured goods to pass northwards. In 1835, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal opened, connecting the Chester Canal at Nantwich to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire at Autherley. It was one of the new generation of canals, which instead of following the contours, used cuttings and embankments to provide a more direct route, and had locks organised into flights where continuing on the level was not possible. Its effect on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire was immediate, with most of the traffic which had previously travelled northwards from Birmingham diverting onto the newer faster route. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire could now only charge tolls for the short distance between Aldersley and Autherley Junctions, instead of the whole to Great Haywood, and in order to minimise the loss of income, they raised the tolls for this section to absurd levels. In order to resolve the situation, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal worked with the Birmingham Canal company and proposed the Tettenhall and Autherley Canal and Aqueduct. This would have left the Birmingham Canal just above lock 19, crossed the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal just below Aldersley Junction by an aqueduct made of iron, and then dropped down through three locks to join the canal above the stop lock. The plans were drawn up by Dugdale Houghton, a firm of surveyors from Birmingham,Staffs and Worcs Canal Society: It could have been different and a bill was presented to Parliament, but the canal was never constructed, as the Staffordshire and Worcestershire company reduced their tolls rather than lose them altogether. The Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal became part of the Shropshire Union Canal network in 1846. Location Autherley Junction is on the summit level of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal, and is around above sea level. It is also the highest point on the Shropshire Union Canal main line, which descends through 46 locks to Ellesmere Port. A stop lock with a minimal drop of just a few inches was built by the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal just before the junction, to ensure that they did not take large volumes of water from the Staffordshire and Worcestershire to supply their canal. It remains in use, although both canals are now managed by the Canal & River Trust and so theft of water is no longer an issue.

His story is used to demonstrate Islam's disapproval of rape and homosexuality.Islam and Homosexuality - Page 206, Samar Habib - 2009 He was commanded by God to preach to his people on monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. The Quran expresses clear disapproval of lutis (described as male homosexuals rather than as sodomites). In the Qur'an, Lot is quoted as saying to his people: The Qur'an directly comments on the people of Lot and on the nature of their sins: Although the Qur'an does not contain a specific punishment or guidance for a luti, the context clearly indicates homosexuality as a moral corruption and describes the punishment for such action for the people of Lot when it grew widespread and accepted in their society. =Hadiths= The hadith are reports of Muhammad's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime. Sunni Hadiths on the subject of anal intercourse between individuals clearly state that it is strictly forbidden. The four Sunni schools unanimously disapprove anal intercourse as several hadith state: * \\"If anyone [resorts to a diviner and believes in what he says (according) to the version of Musa) or] has intercourse with his wife (according to the agreed version) when she is menstruating, or has intercourse with his wife through her anus, he has nothing to do with what has been sent down to Muhammad.\\" ‚Äî Narrated by Abu Hurairah, Book of Divination and Omens, Sunan Abu Dawood, 3895. * \\"Allah is not shy to tell you the truth: do not have intercourse with your wives in the anus.\\"‚ÄîNarrated by Ahmad, 5/213 * \\"On the day of resurrection, Allah will not look at a man who had intercourse with his wife in her anus\\"‚ÄîNarrated by Ibn Abi Shayba, 3/529; narrated and classed as sahih by Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1165 * \\"[Make love to your wife] from the front or the back, but avoid the anus and intercourse during menstruation\\" ‚Äî Reported by Ahmad and Sunan al-Tirmidhi * \\"He who has intercourse with his wife through her anus is accursed\\"‚ÄîNarrated by Abu Hurairah, Book of Marriage, Sunan Abu Dawood 2157 * \\"If you find someone doing the deed of the people of Lot, then execute the doer and the one to whom it was done.\\" reported by Ibn Abbas, Book of Legal Punishments, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Book 17, Hadith 40 [Number 1456], classed as hasan according to Darussalam. * \\"Verily, what I fear most for my nation is the deed of the people of Lot.\\" Narrated by Jabir, Book of Legal Punishments, Sunan al- Tirmidhi, Number 1374, classed as hasan In marriage The same ruling applies for heterosexual relationship (i.e., married couple) when performed as \\"an alternative\\" while the wife is menstruating. When married, it is rightful and obligatory for the husband and the wife to mutually fulfill their needs but only by upholding the guidance of Hadith and the Qur'an. The Quran says: > And they ask thee concerning menstruation. Say, \\"It is a harmful thing, so > keep away from women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until they > are clean. But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as Allah > has commanded you. Allah loves those who keep themselves clean.\\" (2:222) According to Sunni Islam, anal intercourse is haram even if the husband and wife mutually agree on it because mutual agreement does not allow something that has been made haram in Sunni hadith. Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a contemporary Sunni Muslim scholar, states that anal intercourse is prohibited and a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it, and may seek divorce over it if her husband persists or tries to force her,When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar as the act is forbidden. Scholars like Qaradawi and Salih Al Munajjid have clarified that it doesn't nullify the marriage, and the wife must seek divorce in order to separate from the husband.Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar Couples who have done it should repent and stop repeating such major sin. In this regard, a commonly misinterpreted and decontextualized verse from the Qur'an is most often cited as a ground to validate anal intercourse between husband and wife: > Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye > will, and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and > know that ye will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O > Muhammad) :‚ÄîQur'an 2:223 Al Munajjid clarifies that this verse is indicative of the different positions a married couple may copulate in, or adopt, in sexual intercourse, and is fully permissible as long as intercourse takes place in the vagina and not the anus. Involving the anus in foreplay is also forbidden and inserting fingers or objects into the back passage is considered a perversion and is forbidden. Also, the very word \\"cultivate\\" has been interpreted unanimously by all Sunni Islamic jurists as impregnating the wife or nurturing wife as though a farmer cultivates a piece of land, but not as a means of performing forbidden practices. Law (Shariah) =Sunni opinion = Islamic law, or shariah, developed during the 8th and 9th centuries in several different \\"schools\\" based on varying interpretations of the Quran and the hadith.Jivraj&de; Jong, p.2 Many hadiths, the reported sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, prescribe harsh punishments for homosexuality, and this is reflected in the majority of shariah, the Islamic legal codes. Since sexual relations under shariah are only permissible within heterosexual marriage, it follows that sex outside such marriage is adultery and/or fornication, both of which attract punishments. Homosexual sodomy, defined as adultery or fornication or both, thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. Abu Eisa At-Tirmidhi said, ‚ÄúThe people of knowledge disagreed over the legal punishment for the sodomite. The view of some of them is that he should be condemned to death, whether he is married or unmarried, and this is the saying of Malik, Ash- Shafi‚Äôee, Ahmad, and Ishaq. Scholars among the jurists of the companion‚Äôs students such as Hasan Al-Basri, Ibrahim An-Nakh‚Äôai, Ata‚Äô ibn Abu Rabah and others said that the legal punishment for sodomy is equivalent to the punishment for adultery, and this is the saying of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and the people of Kufa.‚Äù One passage in the Qur'an takes a particular legal position towards proven adultery, as well as homosexuality in conjunction with the punishments mentioned in hadith as the punishment is prescribed for 'unlawful sexuality':Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p.88 Despite unanimous disapproval of homosexuality in Islam, in practice, cultural norms in different Muslim countries vary from punishment to condemnation, and only a few Muslim countries actually carry out such punishments. =Shi'ite opinion = Most Shia scholars do not permit anal intercourse. Those who do say it is extremely makrooh.Therefore the majority of the Shi'ah mujtahids have derived two conclusions: (l) that anal intercourse is not haram but strongly disliked (karahatan shadidah) provided the wife agrees to it. (2) and if she does not agree to it, then all mujtahids say that it is precautionarily wajib to refrain from it. (See the fatawa of all contemporary mujtahids in their annotations to al-'Urwatu'l-Wuthqa, p. 628) There are strong indications that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini looked unfavorably upon anal penetration as codified in his two volume work, Tahrir al-Wasilah. According to Grand Ayatollah Sistani, anal intercourse between a married couple is permissible under the condition that \\"permission is bound to wife‚Äôs agreement\\", but the act itself \\"is strongly undesirable.\\" According to Grand Ayatollah Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, \\"anal sex is allowed with her (wife's) permission. Although very hated and discouraged.\\" See also *Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence *Islamic sexual jurisprudence *Islamic views on oral sex  Notes   References     *  External links  *The Prohibition of Sodomy The Etiquettes Of Marriage And Wedding *Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract?
