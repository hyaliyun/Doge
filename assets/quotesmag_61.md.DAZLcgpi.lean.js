Silas Hoke operated a pharmacy, and invented a medication called Willing‚Äôs Suspension of Disbelief, and Beryl Hoke was an accomplished blacksmith. Career Many of Hoke's inventions were lost but are now being rediscovered. He is considered to have been fifty years ahead of his time. Hoke first worked as a fencer, starting his career as an inventor by developing pre-dug fence post holes. Hoke established a tool manufacturing company, Hoke's Tool Company. =Notable inventions= Some of Hoke's more notable inventions are now known to include: * Packaged half baked ideas * A hammer which works around corners * Boxed spark plug sparks * A clock work motor vehicle * The wooden magnet * Bottled spirit level bubbles * The random excuse generator * Tartan paint * Dehydrated water pills Recognition Hoke has been immortalised in various media. Many of his invented tools have been researched and are now documented in the publication, Henry Hoke‚Äôs Guide to the Misguided, and in the publication, The Lost Tools of Henry Hoke. Hoke's work has been featured in exhibitions and festivals, for example by the Australian Network for Art and Technology as part of National Science Week in 2010, and for example in South Australia's 2018 History Festival. In 2013 Questacon featured an exhibition of Hoke's inventions, The Lost Tools of Henry Hoke.

It was started as a blue-ribbon panel by John F. Kennedy in 1961, and later reorganized through executive order into an official panel by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, with the goal of ensuring the right to a \\"decent, dignified place in society\\". Originally known as the President's Committee on Mental Retardation, it was eventually renamed in 2003 by George W. Bush over concerns regarding negative labelling. It was established through the work of Eunice Kennedy Shriver while serving as the head of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The PCPID consists of a 31-member panel composed of 18 citizen members and 13 government officials, with the number of citizen members capped at 21, and each citizen serving maximum two-year terms. The citizen members are each appointed by the president, and the government members consist of the following: * Secretary of Health and Human Services * Secretary of Education * Secretary of Labor * Secretary of Housing and Urban Development * Secretary of Commerce * Secretary of Transportation * Secretary of the Interior * Secretary of Homeland Security * Attorney General * Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service * Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission * Chair of the National Council on Disability * Commissioner of the Social Security Administration The committee receives no federal funding, and administers no grants. The PCPID holds formal meetings twice per year, and issues an annual report providing advice and recommendations. The scope of the PCPID according to its governing executive order is intellectual disability as it relates to: * Expansion of educational opportunities * Promotion of homeownership * Assurance of workplace integration * Improvement of transportation options * Expansion of full access to community living * Increasing access to assistive and universally designed technologies In 1974 the goals of the committee were realigned by Richard Nixon, with a focus on deinstitutionalization, preventive care, and legal rights, and again in 1996 by Bill Clinton, with a focus on community inclusion. The committee is located organizationally under the Administration for Community Living and the Department of Health and Human Services.

The hierarchy of the sciences is a theory formulated by Auguste Comte in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, astronomy, which is the first to reach the \\"positive stage\\" (one of three in Comte's law of three stages). As one moves up the \\"hierarchy\\", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further up the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the social sciences. According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in physics and other natural sciences than there are in the social sciences. Evidence Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences. It has also been found that the degree of scientific consensus is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the biological sciences. Dean Simonton argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks psychology much closer to biology than to sociology.

The league had been formed in 2007 from the merger of the Devon County League and the South Western League, and is restricted to clubs based in Cornwall and Devon. The Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League is on the same level of the National League System as the Western League Division One (Step 6). The constitution was announced on 25 May 2018. At the end of this season, significant restructuring of the league was to take place. With this in mind, it was decided not to transfer clubs between Division One East and Division One West just for one season, solely in order to balance the numbers in each division for this season. For 2019‚Äì20, the league will consist of two Step 6 divisions of twenty clubs each. These two divisions will be made up of the 2018‚Äì19 Step 6 (Premier Division) clubs, plus others promoted from Step 7 and below. There will be two new Step 7 leagues below the South West Peninsula League in 2019‚Äì20, the Devon League and the St Piran League. Premier Division The Premier Division featured 20 teams, the same as the previous season, after Plymouth Parkway were promoted to the Western League Premier Division, and Stoke Gabriel were demoted to Division One East. Two new clubs joined the league: *Elburton Villa, promoted from Division One West. *Millbrook, promoted from Division One West. Reserve sides are not eligible for promotion to Step 5. *Witheridge withdrew from the league on 7 August, before any matches had been played. They joined the Devon League at the start of the 2019‚Äì20 season. *At the end of the season, any clubs not promoted to Step 5 or taking voluntary relegation to Step 7 were placed in one of the two Step 6 divisions for 2019‚Äì20, except Plymouth Argyle Reserves, who did not apply to stay at Step 6. A Plymouth Argyle Development side joined the Devon League at the start of the 2019‚Äì20 season. =League table= Division One East Division One East featured 19 clubs, increased from 18 the previous season, after Totnes & Dartington and Galmpton & Roselands resigned from the league, and three new clubs joined: *Elmore, promoted from the Devon and Exeter League. *Stoke Gabriel, demoted from the Premier Division due to ground grading failure. *Waldon Athletic, promoted from the South Devon League. *All clubs applied for promotion to Step 6 next season except: Alphington, Budleigh Salterton, Liverton United, St Martins, Teignmouth, University of Exeter and Waldon Athletic.

The population of the predominantly Greek- inhabited town of Ayvalik, Ottoman Empire (in modern Turkey) on the east coast of the Aegean Sea was forcibly deported to the hinterland of Anatolia by the Ottoman authorities. The deportation was organized by German General and military adviser to the Ottoman Empire, Liman von Sanders, and included death marches, looting, torture and massacre against the local civilian population. Persecution against the population of the predominantly Greek-inhabited settlement of Aivalik on the east coast of the Aegean had begun in 1910. In 1917, during World War I although nearby Greece was still a neutral state, the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman state was viewed as an internal threat and genocide policies continued to be implemented. Background German general and military advisor to the Ottoman Empire, Otto Liman von Sanders The population of the predominantly ethnic Greek town of Aivalik was subject to state-sponsored persecution already from 1910.Doƒüan, 2010, p. 125 Anti-Greek policies begun with boycott of Greek owned businesses; anti-Greek signs were placed in several public locations in the town and yelling men were mobilized on the streets of Ayvalik in order to terrorize the non-Muslim population. The local population was harassed in the countryside by irregular groups and cultivation of their fields was prohibited.Doƒüan, 2010, p. 133 Persecution was intensified in 1914, when a total of about 154,000 ethnic Greeks living in the western part of the Ottoman Empire lost their homes. With the outbreak of World War I and the participation of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers persecution against the local Greek element took a more violent and systematic form and affected a more extensive area, including also Pontus in northern Anatolia. These policies included confiscations of property, as well as the creation of forced labor battalions for all Greek males. Meanwhile, Greek refugees from the regions of Bergama and Edremit poured into nearby Ayvalik, at that time a town of approximately 30,000 inhabitants and with a Greek majority of 98.5%. The Ottoman authorities sought to further weaken the Greek element of Ayvalik with the confiscation of Greek properties and attacks by Muslim irregulars in the outskirts.Boubougiatzi, 2009, pp. 217, 218, 220 The first wave of deportation of some Ayvalik residents occurred in 1914 and a second one followed in July 1915. Evacuation According to a report by German general and military advisor to the Ottoman Empire Otto Liman von Sanders, the immediate expulsion of the entire Greek of Ayvalik was a military necessity; otherwise he couldn't guarantee the security of the Ottoman front. As soon he visited Ayvalik, von Sanders wondered out loud to the Ottoman officials: Though there was some evidence that specific individuals were spying for the Triple Entente it was decided that the entire community should be deported. The evacuation order was issued at March 14, 1917.Boubougiatzi, 2009, p. 219 According to the Ottoman military commanders, the order was given by Sanders. The entire Greek population of Ayvalik between the ages of 12 and 80 was exiled to inner Anatolia. The operation was organized by Liman von Sanders.Ak√ßam, 2004, p. 146: \\"For example, the entire Greek population of Ayvalik between the ages of 12 and 80 was exiled to inner Anatolia. The wave of expulsions was organized by the German general Liman von Sanders.\\" Though Sanders claimed that he tried to keep the operation under control, numerous atrocities were committed against the local civilian population from early on.Boubougiatzi, 2009, p. 221 Moreover, the deportations were accompanied by looting and destruction of Greek churches, schools, hospitals and dwellings in the region as well as in nearby Bergama and Dikili. According to contemporary reports by the Greek press, gangs of Muslim boys were also mobilized by amputating the hands of Greek children as a punishment after the latter threw stones at the Ottoman soldiers. The future of pro- German King Constantine of Greece became precarious in Greece due to the German involvement in the Ayvalik incident. Inhabitants were forcibly taken out of their homes, beaten and moved to the local military depots. The women and children were forced to march on foot for c. 24 hour to the nearest railway station.Boubougiatzi, 2009, pp. 221-222 During the following week they were relocated to Bursa where they were subject to attacks and lynching by the Muslim mob and irregular groups (bashibazouks). Moreover, hundreds of civilians were taken on death marches to inland parts of Anatolia. The sick were shot by Ottoman soldiers. Aftermath Estimates of the number of the deportees vary: according to Ottoman-Greek representatives they were c. 23,000, while German accounts estimated that c. 12,000-20,000 were forcibly moved out of Ayvalik. The deportation of such a significant number became a major topic in the European diplomatic agenda and the Western press. The German Empire was afraid that such an operation would trigger the entry of Greece (then a neutral country) into World War I on the Allied side. Moreover, the German involvement in the anti-Greek Ayvalik operation had a negative impact on pro-German king Constantine of Greece whose future in Greece became precarious.Boubougiatzi, 2009, p. 222 During 1919-1922, when the region came temporarily under Greek control as part of the terms of the Treaty of S√®vres, only half of Ayvalik's initial population returned. In September 1922 Ayvalik was occupied by troops of the Turkish national movement and its Greek population was forcibly evacuated. A total of 3,000 citizens were transported to inland Anatolia as part of the labour battalions and only 23 of them managed to survive.

Cornell was born in 1906 in Mitcham, then part of Surrey, to Frederick William Gunn and Beatrice Minnie, n√©e Loosemore. She married Stanley Herbert Cornell, a brush manufacturer, in August 1928. She became a founder member of the ladies' section of Mitcham Athletic Club in 1926 at the age of 19. At the British Games in London in August, she broke the long jump world record with a distance of 5.485 m. Later in August, she competed at the 1926 Women's World Games in Gothenburg at which she placed second, recording 5.44 m, behind Japan's Kinue Hitomi. Cornell exceeded Hitomi's world record jump of 5.5 m, but she left a mark in the sand after she turned to speak to an official before leaving the pit. Cornell again became the world record holder in August 1927, jumping 5.575 m, which she held until Hitomi jumped 5.98 m in 1928. The long jump did not feature at the 1928 Summer Olympics, the first games with events for women, and Cornell didn't complete. At a match against Germany in Birmingham in 1930, Cornell set a British record of 5.80 m (19 feet 2.5 inches), becoming the first 19 ft jump by a European. The British record stood for 23 years until 1952. The 1930 Women's World Games in Prague saw Cornell place in second again to Hitomi. Cornell also competed in sprint and hurdle events, and at the Women's Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championships she won the 100 m hurdles in 1927, the 100 yards in 1928, and the 80 m hurdles in 1930. In 1928 she broke the world record for the 80 metres hurdles in the semi-final but was beaten in the final itself. A snapped Achilles tendon in 1934 ended her career as an athlete, however she continued her involvement with the sport. She served as honorary secretary of the Women's Amateur Athletic Association for 11 years, and was organising secretary for the Women's World Games and women's events at the Empire Games both staged in London in 1934. She also managed the women's team at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and helped to establish a national coaching scheme after World War II.

Recently the hall has fallen into financial crisis. Previously there were 100 people employed by the hall. The reduction in the workforce is due to a recession in the business.

He is the author of My Uncle's Wedding, Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood, The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads, and We Make It Better. Books =My Uncle‚Äôs Wedding= My Uncle‚Äôs Wedding is a children's picture book about marriage equality. The main character is a boy named Andy who finds out that his uncle, Mike, is going to marry his long-term boyfriend, Steve. In the book, Andy talks about his uncle's wedding, how it affects him, and the things he gets to do in preparation for the ceremony. Tracy K. Greene created illustrations and the author is credited as Eric Ross instead of Eric Rosswood because he wrote and published the book prior to getting married and changing his last name. Rosswood stated he intentionally left the word \\"gay\\" out of the book because the story was about a wedding, not a \\"gay wedding.\\" My Uncle‚Äôs Wedding was praised by Marriage Equality USA and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. During the official book release, California Senator Mark Leno presented Rosswood with a Senate Certificate of Recognition for My Uncle's Wedding, stating the book's \\"vital role in creating a brighter future.\\" In various interviews, Rosswood explained that the reason he wrote My Uncle‚Äôs Wedding was because he didn't like how opponents of marriage equality would always use kids for political gain, so he decided to write about the topic from a child's perspective. While the book was typically well received, the anti-LGBT group National Organization for Marriage (NOM) was quick to condemn it. =Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood= While trying to expand his own family, Rosswood realized there was a lack of resources available to help same-sex couples compare paths to parenthood. He wrote Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood to help same-sex couples start their own families. The book compares adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, and co-parenting to help LGBTQ people decide which path is right for them. It includes 19 real life stories from parents around the world, including the United States, the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. One of the stories was written by a serodiscordant couple, and it is believed that Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood is the first book that gives an example for how a gay couple can have children when one of the prospective parents is HIV-positive. The book also includes legal tips and advice contributed by the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Actress Melissa Gilbert wrote the foreword and Charlie Condou wrote the introduction. =The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads= Rosswood's third book, The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads, covers general parenting information, but instead of topics focusing on mothers, it highlights information relevant to gay dads. The book includes parenting tips and advice from pediatricians, school educators, lawyers, and other gay parents. The foreword was written by Golden Globe nominated writer, director, and producer Greg Berlanti, best known for his work as executive producer and co-creator of The CW‚Äôs Arrow. The audiobook is narrated by Paul Michael Garcia. The book became the #1 New Release in the Adoption category on Amazon. The book received positive responses from Shawn Moore, Board Member for the Modern Family Alliance, and Stan J. Sloan, CEO for The Family Equality Council. The Washington Blade called it a \\"generous resource.\\" =We Make It Better= In 2018, Rosswood partnered with Kathleen Archambeau to write We Make It Better: The LGBTQ Community and their Positive Contributions to Society. The book is split into ten sections: activism, business, dance, film & television, government and military, music, religion, science, sports, and literature. It features biographies on many subjects, including Oscar Wilde, Emma Gonz√°lez, Bayard Rustin, Lana and Lilly Wachowski, Leonard Matlovich, Johanna Siguroardottir, and Tim Cook. Kate Kendell, Executive Director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, stated, \\"This book is sure to empower the next generation of LGBTQ youth to find their passions and transform the world.\\" Activism In 1997, Rosswood started the first Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) at Orange Glen High School in Escondido, California where he went to school. Rosswood has been an activist for LGBTQ equality and equal rights. In addition to starting a GSA at his high school, he was also a chapter leader for Marriage Equality USA and helped with grassroots activism in the fight against Prop 8, which took away marriage rights from same-sex couples. He joined the board of San Francisco Pride in 2011 and stayed on for two years prior to stepping down before the birth of his son. In 2017, when Heterosexual Pride Day was trending on Twitter, Rosswood tweeted the previously used phrase, \\"It's that time of year again when all the homophobic people complain about not having a #HeterosexualPrideDay and here's the annual response: \\"Gay Pride was not born of a need to celebrate being gay, but our right to exist without persecution. So instead of wondering why there isn't a Straight Pride movement, be thankful you don't need one.\\"\\" That same year, author Kathleen Archambeau included Rosswood in her book Pride & Joy: LGBTQ Artists, Icons and Everyday Heroes for the work he has done for the LGBT community. In January 2019, after Tulsi Gabbard announced she was running for the 2020 United States presidential election, Rosswood tweeted \\"Homophobic remarks from @TulsiGabbard resurface after announcing she‚Äôs running for president? Thank U, Next!\\" Rosswood is now a commentator on LGBTQ issues, including civil rights, parenting, marriage, and politics. He has led panels on LGBTQ parenting issues for organizations such as the Family Equality Council and the Modern Family Alliance. Personal life Rosswood and his husband, Mat, met at a salsa class in 2007. They were married at Disneyland in 2011. They combined their last names (Ross and Wood) to the portmanteau of Rosswood. They adopted their son, Connor, in 2013. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Rosswood stated he and his husband \\"encountered challenges not typically covered in basic parenting manuals\\" because they were same-sex parents. On January 8, 2019, the couple introduced their second child, a girl named Olivia Katherine.

In 1961, he was hired by Energoprojekt, a Serbian construction and infrastructure company, where he held a prominent role until his retirement in 1998. As lead architect for the company, he worked in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America. Known for a modernist approach, his portfolio includes industrial facilities and sports complexes, as well as power plants, large housing complexes and urban public spaces. He produced the plans for the International Fair in Lagos, which was attended by American president Jimmy Carter, and co-designed the State Secretariat in the Nigerian state of Kano with fellow architect Milica ≈†teriƒá. He is also responsible for the overall urban planning of seven cities in Kanou. Additionally, he worked in Iraq and built Baghdad's Al Qulaf Housing and Business Center. Bojovic had to address every aspect of his projects, including hydro-power, nuclear energy and aerodynamics. Regarding the design of the triad aerodynamic tunnel in ≈Ωarkovo, he ended up modifying the machinery to reduce pressure and noise, thus resulting in a better constructed tunnel. Bojovic credits his father, a mechanical engineer, for his interest in the technical sciences.

Early years and education Marguerite Merington was born in Stoke Newington, England, in 1857, At an early age, she came with her parents to Buffalo, New York where was educated at a convent. Even as a girl, she displayed dramatic talent, and often wrote and acted little parlor plays. Career For several years, she was instructor in Greek and Latin in the Normal College in New York. After resigning from this position, Merington pursued the career of a dramatic author. About 1889, E. H. Sothern proposed that Merington should write him a play, the leading character of which should be a captivating Irish gentleman. With a few suggestions from him, the play, Captain Lettarblair was written. It had a trial at an authors' matinee in New York City, and was first presented August 16, 1892, at the Lyceum Theatre. Captain Lettarblair, produced by Daniel Frohman, brought in large audiences and much money, and held a place in Sothern's repertoire. Before it was acted, Joseph Jefferson, who saw the manuscript, praised it highly. Merington wrote other dramas, including Good- Bye, A Lover's Knot, and the libretto of a comic opera, Daphne, or the Pipes of Arcadia.

He studied in Watson School, Madhubani. He joined the NSUI at the age of 17. He participated in many events in Madhubani. He was recognised by the then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi and senior leaders like Sitaram Kesri and was made All India NSUI General Secretary. He was given the charge of A number of states like Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir.

The other petitioner's were Sushil Modi from BJP , Shivanand Tiwari from Rjd , Saryu Rai from BJP and Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh from JD(U). He was suspended from the party by Sitaram Kesri for doing so but later brought back when Mrs. Sonia Gandhi took charge as the Indian National Congress President. It is believed that the Congress party lost its golden opportunity to take a firm stand against Lalu Prasad Yadav and make itself strong again in Bihar when his stand was disowned. *His Anti Lalu Stand caused him to lose the chance of becoming the President of All India Youth Congress. Sitaram Kesri who had a soft corner for Lalu Yadav and leaders like Jagannath Mishra (accused in fodder scam) in 1994 convinced the then Congress President P.V. Narasimha Rao to cancel his appointment with immediate effect. The reason was the standby support by Lalu's Party in the loksabha to the Indian National Congress. =Role in Bihar Politics= * Mishra surrounded the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1994 with around 15000 NSUI workers in a reaction to the shooting of a student by Bihar Police in Dalsinghsarai. The then Patna SP Ajoy Kumar who later joined the congress in jharkhand was unable to control the angry crowd. Ultimately, The Chief Minister had to give monetary concession to the injured student and the medical expenses were taken care of as a result of the protest. *After he left the post of Bihar NSUI President in 1995 the NSUI in Bihar became weaker.

He believes that this will not allow people to become Civil Servants by opting Maithili as an optional subject in the UPSC CSE because no teachers have been appointed.

Representatives of this scientific area are called Manas Studies scholars. Periods of development Scientific research of the epic began in the second half of the XIX century by Ch. Valikhanov and V. Radlov. Valikhanov had recorded one of the episodes (\\"Pominki po Kyokyotoyu\\") in 1856 and partially translated it into Russian. The texts published by Radlov in 1885 in St. Petersburg (in Kyrgyz and German languages) occupy 12,454 lines (including 9449 lines about \\"Manas\\"). Full record of the texts of the \\"Manas\\" trilogy has been carried out since 1920, however, fixing versions by manaschi, let alone their full publication are still far from complete. Kazakh writer M.O. Auezov wrote the first work after Chokan Valikhanov‚Äôs works, a monograph on the Kyrgyz \\"Manas\\" epic, by creating of a free version of his texts. Monuments were erected for both Kazakh researchers in the Bishkek city. Among the Russian scientists who studied the epic were V. Radlov (the author of the first Russian translation of fragments of the epic), P. Falev (the author of the first Soviet study on \\"Manas\\" - articles \\"How the Kara-Kygyz epic is built\\") and S. Malov. The All-Union Scientific Conference of 1952 in Frunze came to the conclusion that the epic \\"is folk in its basis\\". Among the translators of the epic into Russian are S. Lipkin, L. Penkovsky, M. Tarlovskiy and others. The largest Russian translation (prosaic) is in 4 volumes so far by A.S. Mirbadaleva and N. V. Kydaish-Pokrovskaya for a bilingual edition in the series \\"Epic of the Peoples of the USSR\\" (1984-1995), covers about 50 thousand lines (according to S.Orozbakov). The first one who played the \\"Manas\\" epic in Russian language in the translations of E. Polivanov, L. Penkovsky, M. Tarlevsky and S. Lipkin, is a national artist of Kyrgyzstan Valery Rovinsky. Abbreviated versions of the epic exist in Kazakh language (4 volumes in M. Auezov's presentation, including 2 parts about Manas and the part about Semetey and Seytek) and in Uzbek language (the poet Mirtemir); separate episodes were translated into German, Hungarian, English and other languages.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on 13 August 2019. Ports for the Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android were released in 2020.  Gameplay  left Dicey Dungeons combines elements of roguelike games with deck-building games. The game takes place on a game show-like backdrop, where Lady Luck challenges adventurers, each having been turned into a dice, to complete a dungeon with a rather unlikely chance of winning their freedom. The player takes one of six characters, which defines the type of equipment they will start with. The player then moves their character across a dungeon map, where there are various encounters with monsters, treasure chests, health items, shops, and upgrade stations, along with exits to the next level. The goal of each run is to reach the lowest level of the dungeon and defeat the boss. Doing so unlocks the metagame progression, such as unlocking additional characters, or new episodes for existing characters that introduce new rulesets that make runs more difficult. When encountering a monster, the combat takes place in a turn-based manner. On their turn, the player is shown their equipment, each which has slots for one or more dice to be added, and then a random roll of the number of dice their character currently possesses. The player then places each dice into one of the equipment slots; when all slots are filled, this creates a combat effect. For example, a sword may have a slot for a single dice, and when a dice is slotted, it will do the damage shown on that dice. Some slots have specific requirements, such as an odd or even number, or dice values less or greater than some number. Some equipment or abilities can alter the dice rolls, allowing the dice to be reused. The player continues to slot dice into equipment and abilities until they have exhausted their dice for the turn, or end their turn early. Their opponents have similar equipment with dice slots, and arranges their attacks in similar manner. There are various buffs and debuffs that can be triggered through equipment from both the player and enemy. Combat continues until the player character's health or the enemies' health drops to zero, or both. If only the player-character's health is reduced to zero, then the game is over and the player must restart the game. If the enemy's health is reduced to zero, the enemy is defeated and the player-character wins, gaining in-game monetary rewards and character experience, along with other potential rewards. By gaining levels, the player-character gains more total health as well as an extra dice that is rolled. The player may also get new equipment that they can equip on the character at any time outside of battles. Shops in levels can be used to buy new equipment, trade equipment, or other features. Upgrade stations can improve the effect of one piece of equipment. Development Terry Cavanagh announced Dicey Dungeons in May 2018, after about three months of prior development, with an in-progress free version available for users to try up to this point. Cavanagh had planned to produce a commercial version of the game for release later in 2018. Dicey Dungeons is inspired by one of the first roguelike deck-builder games, Dream Quest. The game's art was created by Marlowe Dobbe, while its music was composed by Chipzel. Dicey Dungeons was ultimately released on 13 August 2019 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux personal computers. Cavanagh plans to release ports of the title for the Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android by 2020. Reception Dicey Dungeons has received generally favorable reviews, according to aggregator Metacritic. The game has been called a good introduction into roguelike deck-building games. The PC release of the game was among the best-selling new releases of the month on Steam. Following its initial release exclusive to bandcamp, game soundtrack record label Materia Collective released the official soundtrack by Chipzel on December 20, 2019.https://gamingaudionews.com/2019/12/20/electronic-soundtrack-to-dicey- dungeons-now-widely-available/ Notes References External links * Category:2019 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Deck-building card games Category:Linux games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Roguelike video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games ","title":"Dicey Dungeons"},{"id":"57350011","text":"This article is an outline of terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2018 in chronological order.

The cave's proximity to Reykjav√≠k made it popular with visitors, who caused damage to the cave. In late 2016 the cave was closed to the public to clear accumulated garbage and install lighting and a walkway to part of the cave. The cave reopened for guided tours the following year.  Description  Raufarh√≥lshellir is the fourth-longest lava tube in Iceland, at long, with a typical height of at least and width up to . The cave has multiple skylights, or holes in the ceiling, under which snow accumulates. Iceland Route 39 crosses over the cave at a point where it is about 15 meters in diameter. The cave hosts microbial mats containing a variety of microorganisms, including actinobacteria and acidobacteria. The land containing the cave is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and rented to a company that operates the guided tours.  History  Raufarh√≥lshellir formed 5600 years ago, based on carbon dating. The source of the lava flow that created the tube is uphill from the cave and was part of the Leitahraun eruption. An expedition in 1971 by the Shepton Mallet Caving Club was one of the first systematic explorations of caves in Iceland. Given its proximity to Reykjav√≠k, it is popular with visitors. Over 20,000 people visited the cave in 2015. The cave was also used as a filming location for the 2014 film Noah and the series Sense8. Prior to 2016, it was freely open to the public, but it closed late that year due to concerns with garbage accumulation, damage to the cave, and the cost of rescuing visitors.

The bank is headquartered in Danbury, Connecticut and was founded in 1866.https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=4293041 Bloomberg Union Savings Bank profile History The mutual savings bank was founded as the Union Savings Bank of Danbury by a group of Danbury citizens including James S. Taylor, the bank‚Äôs first president. The Legislature of the State of Connecticut authorized the incorporation of the bank on June 20, 1866. The bank was first located in a store owned by trustee Samuel Stebbins on Main Street in Danbury. In June 2016, the bank celebrated its 150th year of being in business. = Main Office = In 1887, the architectural firm Berg & Clark of New York City was selected to design the bank‚Äôs current office at 226 Main Street in Danbury, also known as the \\"United Banks Building\\". Until 1925, Union Savings Bank co-occupied the first floor of the three-story Romanesque Victorian building with the National Pahquioque Bank. That year, an expansion of the building saw the main entry relocated to the center of the building where it resides today. The second and third floors at the time housed the high school, a 500-seat ballroom and the YMCA, among other offices. Years after Union Savings Bank became the sole occupant of the United Banks Building, repairs were made to the bank‚Äôs vault area following a bomb attack and robbery in 1970. At the same time, modern amenities including acoustic tiles, fluorescent lights and a drive-up window were added, and a one-story addition was built at the back of the building. In 1983, Union Savings Bank became a part of the area known as the Main Street Historic District. Two decades later, further renovations included raising ceilings to the maximum height, replacing original mechanical systems and replacing the teller counters, maintaining the 1925 aesthetic. During this renovation, pieces of frieze and molding from the original lobby were discovered and protected with Christo wrap. = Merger with The First National Bank of Litchfield = In 2010, Union Savings Bank expanded its branch offices into Litchfield County through a merger with The First National Bank of Litchfield, the oldest nationally chartered bank in the state of Connecticut. The First National Bank of Litchfield had been in operation in Litchfield County for 196 years.  Leadership  Cynthia C. Merkle has served as President and CEO of Union Savings Bank since 2014. Other members of the leadership team include Paul Bruce, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Frederick ‚ÄúRick‚Äù F. Judd, III, CFP¬Æ, EVP and Head of Wealth Management and Branch Banking and Peter Maher, EVP and Chief Lending Officer. A Board of Trustees and team of Corporators also contribute to company leadership.  Union Savings Bank Foundation  The Union Savings Bank Foundation was established in 1998 to provide contributions to charitable organizations and non-profits in Connecticut. The Bank makes annual contributions to sustain the foundation‚Äôs endowment. Each year during an open application period, 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations are invited to submit requests to receive grants from the foundation. In 2018, these grants contributed $202,525 to 18 different local non-profit organizations in Connecticut. Organizations that receive support from the foundation serve a range of needs including child and family services, medical and dental care for low-income individuals and educational resources for underserved communities. Since 2016, the foundation has focused its efforts primarily on education, forming the USB Teachers‚Äô Closet to help provide school supplies to teachers in local communities.

In some recent cabinets, it has also been responsible for employment; in others, for family affairs and science. The current Minister of the Economy is Margarete Schramb√∂ck. Originally founded in 1848 as the Ministry for Commerce and Public Works (Ministerium f√ºr Handel und √∂ffentliche Arbeiten), the institution's formal name of exact portfolio have undergone numerous changes over the years. As of 2018, the ministry is officially called the Ministry of Digital and Economic Affairs (Ministerium f√ºr Digitalisierung und Wirtschaftsstandort or BMDW).  History  The Ministry of Economy was first established in the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire as the Ministry for Commerce and Public Works (Ministerium f√ºr Handel und √∂ffentliche Arbeiten). Over the course of the next several decades, its list of responsibilities gradually grew longer; its name changed several time to reflect the new reality. In 1918, following the collapse of the Austrian Empire in the final days of World War I, the ministry was briefly divided into a commerce department (Staatsamt f√ºr Gewerbe, Industrie und Handel) and a reconstruction department (Staatsamt f√ºr Kriegs- und √úbergangswirtschaft). The two halves were reunited within the year. The Ministry went back to gradually acquiring new areas of responsibility and occasionally changing its name. In 1967, the Ministry was split into a Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Ministerium f√ºr Handel, Gewerbe und Industrie) and a Ministry of Civil Engineering (Ministerium f√ºr Bauten und Technik); the latter assumed responsibility for managing public real estate and structures, roadworks, waterways, hydraulic engineering, water supply, sewerage, the promotion of housing construction, and engineering standardization, among other things. The split was undone in 1987. In 2000, the Sch√ºssel cabinet merged the Ministry of Economy with the Ministry of Labor. Road construction and maintenance and a number of minor matters were assigned to the Ministry of Traffic; waterways and hydraulic engineering went to the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Environment took over family affairs, becoming the Ministry of Social Affairs in the process. The merger was undone in 2008. The Ministry's current name and portfolio dates to 2018.  Responsibilities   Structure  As of May 2018, the ministry consists of the Minister and his personal staff (Kabinett), the office of the director general, and nine departments: * Information management (Abteilung Informationsmanagement) * Public relations (Abteilung Presse, √ñffentlichkeitsarbeit und Filmwirtschaft) * Budget and administration (Bereich Budget und Administration) * Human resources and legal (Bereich Personal und Recht) * Economic policy, innovation, and technology (Center 1 ‚Äì Wirtschaftspolitik, Innovation und Technologie) * External economic relations policy and European integration (Center 2 - Au√üenwirtschaftspolitik und Europ√§ische Integration) * Enterprise policy (Sektion I Unternehmenspolitik) * Historical buildings (Sektion II Historische Objekte) * Digitalization, innovation, and electronic government (Sektion III Digitalisierung, Innovation und E-Government) The Minister and his staff are political appointees; the general secretary and the section heads are career civil servants.

Career In 1865, Denis Albert assumed control of the family business.L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur file, Denis Albert Bardou, cote LH/114/21. The company was located at his residence at 55, rue de Chabrol. The company manufactured and sold astronomical telescopes, spyglasses, binoculars, microscopes and opera glasses. The telescopes included both equatorial and azimuthal models with silvered glass mirrors (10, 16, 20 cm).William Tobin. \\"Evolution of the Foucault-Secretan Reflecting Telescope.‚Äù Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage, 19(2), 106‚Äì184 (2016). Between 1867 and 1891 the Bardou company won numerous awards at expositions of Le Havre, Philadelphia, and Paris, including a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889. It furnished optical instruments to the French Minist√®re de la Guerre, Minist√®re de la Marine and to foreign governments.L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur file, Denis Albert Bardou, cote LH/114/21. The Maison Bardou and its fellow Paris-based competitors the Secr√©tan and Mailhat companies were among the leading French precision optics manufacturers of the early twentieth century. Bardou telescopes and optical products were widely exported to Europe, the United States and even further afield. Other activities Bardou became a member of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France in 1888 (only one year after it was established).Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France et Revue Mensuelle d'Astronomie, de M√©t√©orologie et de Physique du Globe, 1902, vol. 16, pp. 567. Advertisements for his company's telescopes appeared frequently in the pages of the society's bulletin. Death and legacy Bardou died on 14 March 1893 in his home in Paris.Archives de Paris, √âtat civil de Paris, Actes d'√©tat civil, Paris-10e arrondissement, 1893 D√©c√®s, V4E 8913, entry 1170. In 1896, Jules Vial, an engineer, became the successor to the Maison Bardou. He continued manufacturing telescopes under the name ‚ÄúBardou‚Äù or ‚ÄúBardou-Vial‚Äù for at least the next 15 years. By 1899, the company had moved to 59, rue Caulaincourt, Paris.J. Vial. Instruments d'optique Maison Bardou (La Rochelle: Imprimerie Nouvelle Noel Texier, 1899). Notable telescopes Besides manufacturing small telescopes, Bardou also built large ones upon request. * When Camille Flammarion built his observatory in Juvisy-sur-Orge in 1883, he commissioned Bardou to construct the large equatorial mount refracting telescope of 240 mm diameter and 3600 mm focal length.Colette Aymard et Laurence-Anne Mayeur, ¬´ L‚Äôobservatoire de Juvisy-sur-Orge, l‚Äô¬´ univers d‚Äôun chercheur ¬ª √† sauvegarder ¬ª, In Situ [online], 29  2016, published 13 July 2016, consulted 16 June 2017. * In 1889, the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France commissioned Bardou to build an equatorial mount refractor with a 108 mm diameter for the Observatory of the rue Serpente atop its new headquarters in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.Marie-Claude Paskoff.

He was a student of the distinguished Latin American painter Jaime Colson, who also mentored Mario Carre√±o, the Cuban-Chilean master. Ulloa also studied drawing with illustrator and painter Domingo Liz.  Career  Ulloa participated in more than a hundred solo and collective exhibits around the world and the subject of four books that illustrate his contributions. Art historian and author, C√°ndido Ger√≥n of Alberto Ulloa, Visionario Fant√°stico, reveals Ulloa's gift: ‚ÄúAs colors correspond to human emotions, Ulloa can achieve an optical illusion. Color in his work is impregnated with diaphanous sensitivity. His chromatic atmospheres sometimes make us think that we are before some sort of dream, due to the inscrutable sensuality of his tones‚Äù. Ulloa was the recipient of many prizes and awards and given the keys to the cities of Miami, FL and Jersey City, NJ.

Ridlr allows commuters to access real-time information about the various modes of transportation. It also books tickets and tokens through the app with digital money. Ridlr covers Mumbai and Delhi in association with BEST, Mumbai Metro and Delhi Metro. It also provides service for cities including Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Bellary and Chennai.  History  Ridlr was introduced in India in 2012 by Bird‚Äôs Eye Systems Private Limited for Delhi and Mumbai. The owners were Brijraj Vaghani and Ravi Khemani. In April 2018 it was taken over by Ola. After Mumbai, Ridlr added southern cities. The information services of the Ridlr app became available in Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Bellary, Chennai, and other cities. In 2015, the app transformed into a transactional app and associated with BEST and later with MBMT and NMMT. This permitted travelers to buy bus tickets as well as passes through the app. In 2017, the app became an IoT service provider. This enabled customers to access the gates of Mumbai Metro. Travelling without the intervention of a physical ticket counter in the Mumbai Metro services was enabled. Online payment eradicated the need for standing in a queue. During demonetization, the cash crunch was eased by this app. 64 Ridlr employees joined Ola to support the association. The Mumbai-based setup will be led by Vaghani. The user journey during the initial days of 2014 through the app was: * Initial and final destinations * Real-time data regarding the various modes of transport * User choice of transport mode  Funding  * Series A funding was received from Matrix Partners in December 2013 and Qualcomm Ventures in September 2014. * Series B funding came from Times Internet, Qualcomm Ventures, and Matrix Ventures, reaching $6 million.

The bill's dimensions are 150 √ó 75 mm. It has been put into circulation on 10 February 2017. The obverse of the note features a likeness of King John III Sobieski. The reverse depicts a crowned eagle and the Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw. It has been designed by Andrzej Heidrich who designed the remaining notes of the 1994/2012 series as well. The banknotes feature a double-letter prefix and a seven-digit serial number.  History  = First z≈Çoty banknotes = A 500 z≈Çotych note was among the treasury notes issued in 1794. = Second z≈Çoty banknotes = Once the z≈Çoty was reinstated in 1924, a 500 z≈Çotych note featuring an image of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, dated 1919 and printed in advance in Great Britain, was put into circulation. It was the highest-value note in circulation until the outbreak of World War II. Under the General Government, the Bank of Issue in Poland issued a 500 z≈Çotych note dated 1940. The so- called Lublin series (seria lubelska) of banknotes dated 1944 included a 500 z≈Çotych note. It was withdrawn in 1947, earlier than the other notes from the same series, due to being forged particularly often. Two other 500 z≈Çotych notes followed. They were dated 1946 and 1947 and entered circulation in 1946 and 1949, respectively. Both were withdrawn in 1950. = Third z≈Çoty banknotes = In 1950, a series of notes dated 1948 was introduced. It included a 500 z≈Çotych note, the largest of the series, that featured a likeness of a miner on the front and three miners at work on the back. These notes circulated between 1950 and 1977. From January 1975 onwards, the 1948 series started being replaced with new, smaller notes. A likeness of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko was once again chosen for the 500 z≈Çotych note. These notes are dated 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1982, the latter ones being issued into the 1990s without the date being changed. They circulated until the end of 1996. Replaced by the fourth z≈Çoty, they could be exchanged for the new currency until the end of 2010. = Current banknotes = In 1995, a new series of notes was introduced. Initially, it included values of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 z≈Çotych. In 2017, the National Bank of Poland put the 500 z≈Çotych note into circulation in order to facilitate cash settlements between individuals, decrease the currency management costs for entrepreneurs and the central bank, as well as allow the bank to improve the management of the supply of circulating banknotes.

He is a specialist long-distance steeplechaser known for his front-running style and apparently inexhaustible stamina. He won three minor hurdle races but began to show better form in the 2015/16 when taking the Worcester Novices' Chase and the Mildmay Novices' Chase. He emerged as a top-class steeplechaser in the following season when he won the Hennessy Gold Cup, Welsh Grand National and Denman Chase as well as finishing third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. In the spring of 2018 he won a second Denman Chase before recording his biggest win in the 2018 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Background Native River is a chestnut gelding, with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Fred Mackey. As a foal he was consigned to the Tattersalls Ireland National Hunt sale in November 2010 and was bought for ‚Ç¨6,000 by John Dineen. He was sired by Indian River, a top-class jumper in his native France, where his wins included the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique. As a breeding stallion, the most notable of his other offspring has been the Hennessy Gold Cup winner Madison du Berlais. Native River's dam, Native Mo was an unraced daughter of Be My Native. As a descendant of the Irish broodmare Rose Cygnet (foaled 1927) she was distantly related to Milady Rose (Irish 1,000 Guineas), Dragonara Palace (Richmond Stakes) and Brondesbury (Norfolk Stakes). Racing career =2014/15 season= Native River began his racing career on the amateur point-to-point circuit, unseating his rider at the Dromahane meeting on 17 March 2014. He was then sent to England and entered professional training with Colin Tizzard at Milborne Port, in Dorset. He finished third in a National Hunt Flat race at Newton Abbot Racecourse on 10 October and then recorded his first success in a Novices' Hurdle race at Stratford Racecourse three weeks later. A month later, he started at odds of 10/1 for a more valuable novice event at Newcastle Racecourse and won by lengths from the favourite Red. When stepped up in class, Native River finished last of the six runners in the Challow Novices' Hurdle and then fell at the penultimate flight in the Classic Novices' Hurdle. In a Novices' hurdle at Exeter Racecourse in February, he started at odds of 9/2 and won by lengths from the Paul Nicholls-trained Emerging Talent. In March he made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival where he started a 40/1 outsider for the Spa Novices' Hurdle and came home ninth of the ten finishers. =2015/16 season= In the 2015/16 season Native River was campaigned in Novices' steeplechases, starting with a third place at Chepstow Racecourse in October. A sixteen-length win at Exeter followed before the gelding was stepped up in class for the Worcester Novices' Chase over three miles at Newbury Racecourse on 26 November. Ridden as in most of his races up to then by Brendan Powell he took the lead approaching the final fence and drew away to win by almost four lengths from Un Temps Pour Tout. One of his owners, Garth Broom, said \\"He's only five and giving weight away against older, more experienced horses... he's got it all, he can stay and he can quicken\\". He was made favourite for the Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse but after jumping awkwardly he finished third to Tea For Two. After finishing third to Blaklion and Red in the Towton Novices' Chase at Wetherby Racecourse in February, the gelding was sent for a second time to the Cheltenham Festival to contest the National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup and finished runner-up behind Minella Rocco. On his final appearance of the year Native River was sent to Aintree Racecourse in April for the Mildmay Novices' Chase in which he started the 11/2 third favourite behind Un Temps Pour Tout and Blaklion, both of whom had won at Cheltenham. Ridden by Richard Johnson, who was to become his regular jockey, he led for most of the way and stayed on strongly to win by three lengths from Henri Parry Morgan. After the race Tizzard said \\"One of his main attributes is staying. The horse runs a bit lazy but there's nothing wrong with that, they last a bit longer. Richard had to wake him up once or twice but he was straight back into his stride. He obviously loves that ground with his lovely, low action.\\" =2016/17 season= Native River began his fourth campaign by finishing second to Silsol in the West Yorkshire Hurdle at Wetherby Racecourse in October before returning to steeplechase fences. For the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury on 26 November he was assigned a weight of 155 pounds and started the 7/2 favourite in a nineteen-runner field. Racing in first or second place for most of the way he took a clear lead after the final fence and held off the late challenge of the outsider Carole's Destrier to win by half a length. Colin Tizzard commented \\"It looked like he would win by five lengths, but when Carole's Destrier nearly got to him, he went again. It is a sign of a good, honest stayer. We expected a big run, but he travelled better than ever before and jumped beautifully\\". A month later Native River carried top weight of 165 pounds in the Welsh Grand National over three and three quarter miles at Chepstow. Starting the 11/4 favourite he took the lead before halfway and won by one and three-quarter lengths from Raz de Maree with fifteen lengths back to Houblon des Obeaux in third. In the Denman Chase at Newbury on 11 February in which Native River was opposed by Bristol de Mai (Finale Juvenile Hurdle, Scilly Isles Novices' Chase) and Le Mercurey (Future Champion Novices' Chase) he led from the start and won by three and a quarter lengths. On 17 March the gelding started the 7/2 second favourite behind Djakadam for the 2017 Cheltenham Gold Cup and disputed the lead for most of the way before finishing third, beaten two and three quarter lengths and a short head by Sizing John and Minella Rocco. =2017/18 season= After an absence of almost eleven months, Native River returned to action in the Denman Chase on 10 February 2018. Starting the 8/11 favourite he repeated his 2017 success as he led from the start and won by twelve lengths from Cloudy Dream. The 2018 edition of the Cheltenham Gold Cup attracted a field of fifteen and saw Native River start 5/1 third favourite behind Might Bite (King George VI Chase) and Our Duke (Irish Grand National). The other runners included Red, Djakadam, Tea For Two, Killultagh Vic (Irish Daily Mirror Novice Hurdle), Road To Respect (Leopardstown Christmas Chase), Outlander (Lexus Chase) and Edwulf (Irish Gold Cup). Native River led from the start but was consistently pressed by Might Bite in second place. Might Bite took the lead two fences out but Native River rallied to regain the advantage at the last obstacle and pulled away on the run-in to win by four and a half lengths. After the race Richard Johnson said \\"I felt we‚Äôd gone quite steady but sometimes when you‚Äôre on a good horse it doesn‚Äôt feel that quick. I knew Native River's a stayer and he answered every call... he's just a warrior and it's a pleasure to ride him... very few horses are as straightforward and brave as he is.\\" Pedigree References Category:2010 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 31 Category:Cheltenham Gold Cup winners Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:National Hunt racehorses ","title":"Native River"},{"id":"57350734","text":"Gymnetina is a genus of fruit and flower chafers in the family of beetles known as Scarabaeidae.

History  The town palace of the Counts of Larisch was built after the great fire of Cieszyn in 1789. Jan J√≥zef Antoni count Larisch von M√∂nnich - founder of the residence, decided to build for himself a seat that would reflect his social status and property. In 1796 count Jan Larisch bought a small bourgeois house neighbouring with a gentry house at the then Konwiktowa Street - currently Tadeusza Regera Street) that was owned by the Larisch family since the 18th century. Combining the two properties allowed him to start the planned project and build the elegant residence of counts Larisch in 1790-1796. In 1805 the emperor Francis I invited to Cieszyn his two allies - tsar Alexander I, the grand duke Constantine, marshal Kutuzov and duke Biron of Courland. This was the time when in the Palace of the Larisch family, especially in the so-called Egyptian Hall, concerts and balls were organised for the guests of Francis Joseph. In 1809 the palace became the seat of Albert Duke of Saxony and Teschen, and then the archduke Karl Ludwig Habsburg. In 1817 the palace hosted the emperor Francis I and his wife Caroline Augusta and their retinue. In 1831 the palace was sold to duke Philip Ludwig Saint Genois d‚ÄôAnneaucourt, who in 1839 sponsored the construction of the third wing of the palace designed by a Vienesse architect Joseph Kornh√§usel. In this wing a circular stable was designed (currently a caf√©) over which a ballroom called a Roman Hall was located. In 1840 the palace was purchased by a barrister dr Antoni Demel (from this moment the palace was called Demel's tenement house), later on it was assigned to subsequent mayors of Cieszyn - Johann Demel von Elswehr (Antoni's son) and Leonard Demel von Elswehr (Antoni‚Äô grandson). The Demel's tenement house was sold to the town in 1918 and on 21 June 1931 became the seat of the City Museum. The new institution was created from the collection of the public museum of father Leopold Jan Szersznik (founded in 1802), ethnographic Silesian Museum (founded in 1903 by the Polish Ethnographical Association in Cieszyn), the municipal Town Museum and private collections. In 1942 a fire broke out in the Roman Hall that destroyed the entire roof and damaged rooms on the second floor. On 24 January 1966 the museum was closed pursuant to a post-inspection requisition of the Work Inspector of the Culture and Art Officers Trade Union. After an overhaul the museum reopened on 1 May 1969. Due to poor technical condition of the building, museum exhibitions were closed in 1983 and a general overhaul was initiated that included adjustments to modern needs of the museum. The overhaul was finished in 2002.  Architecture  The building bears traces of Baroque-neoclassical style. The two storey and three wing building is made of brick and broken stone in cellars. It is plastered. The cellars of the palace are partially bricked up and vaulted in line with a barrel style. The interior design is based on two tracts. On the ground floor there are two arterial hallways: the first one with a cross-barrel vaulting and a barrel one with a lunette, the second one with a barrel vaulting with lunettes. Most of the rooms in plinth have barrel and sail vaulting. In the south wing there is a former stable (currently a caf√©) based on a circular plan, two storeys high, crowned by a domed vault with lunettes, based on a Tuscan stone column. The rooms on the first floor located in the front tract of the north wing have cross-barrel and barrel vault with lunettes, with four fields of sail vault with corners. A room in the east wing has a barrel vault. A room on the second floor of the north and south wing have hollow vault (the Egyptian Hall), the remaining rooms have ceilings. Stairways on the second floor are equipped with forged railings from the eighteenth century. The front fa√ßade has seven axes. The ground floor part is bossaged and is separated from the first floor by a profiled moulding. The first and the second floor are separated by vertical pairs of slender panels. On the axis of the building there is a stone portal with cones, which is crowned by a triangle pediment with a semi-circular arch. A two wing stave gate leading to the courtyard comes from the end of the 18th century. Rectangular windows have profiled frames. The windows on the second floor of the middle part are extended and topped with a basket arch. Between the columns of the windows there are fluted panels with the themes of tears and rosettes. The side fa√ßade (as seen from the Park of Peace) has twelve axes. The ground floor part is buttressed, based on the remains of defence walls and separated from the first floor by a mould. The windows of the second floor are decorated by long-eared envelope-shaped frames. The palace is covered by a saddle, mansard and shingled roof with dormer-windows. The rooms on the second floor are of a representative character. Some of them (eight front ones and a corridor of the second floor) are decorated with neo-classical polychrome. The notable rooms are: The Chinese Study, decorated with oriental themes (dragons, a paradise bird) and the Egyptian Hall being a ballroom. The painting decoration of the latter hall is composed of six landscapes with themes of ancient Egyptian architecture and genre scenes located on the Egyptian columns. The landscapes include the interwoven and repeated theme of the Piast Tower and the Rotunda of St. Nicholas in Cieszyn. One of landscapes has polychrome dating back to 1796 placed there by its creator - \\"an academic painter\\" Joseph Mayer. A suite of apartments located on the second floor of the Palace has been enhanced by a set of neoclassical and eclectic furnaces located in semicircular niches. A small French garden with an octagonal pavilion (currently the Park of Peace) was attached to the palace.

The collection is also based on antiques gathered by the Town Museum in Cieszyn and antiques gathered by the Polish Ethnographical Association (incorporated to the collection of the museum in 1930). The Archaeological Section was founded in 1969, inspired by the Region's Enthusiasts Association that brought into being the so-called Association of Gravediggers and Other Hole-explorers. Members of this association contributed to numerous archaeological discoveries in the area of the Old Town. Other materials came from excavations at Castle Hill in Cieszyn, as well as the settlements in Miƒôdzy≈õwieƒá and Old Bielsko. * ethnography - consists of 6415 items, the majority of which are inherited from the Polish Ethnographical Association that has operated since 1901 and the Polish Association of Folk and Domestic Industry in Cieszyn that has operated since 1931. Among the exhibits there are boxes and painted drawers, pictures on glass, parish feast art, elements of folk costumes and jewellery, folk ceramics and everyday use objects. * photography - separated in 1981 with approx. 20000 items that include photographic iconography of Cieszyn and Cieszyn Silesia, portraits of burgher citizens, artistic photography of Cieszyn, glass negatives, stereoscope pictures, postcards and photographic equipment, photographic frames and albums. The collection of the Photography Section of the Cieszyn Silesia Museum shows a broad, over sixty year long, panorama of the history of photography in Cieszyn Silesia. It illustrates the landscape, culture, human stories and the transition in this part of Europe. The set comes from the collection initiated by Oskar Weismann, the creator of the Town Museum set up in 1901. Another sets came from donations of citizens of Cieszyn and collectors and comprised daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, ferrotypes, pannotypes and contemporary pictures as a documentary of the past. An equally interesting collection is 1500 photographic portraits of almost all social and professional groups of Cieszyn taken between 1860-1900. Part of the collection are illustrations of the ethnographic collection of the Silesian Museum, derived from the Polish Ethographical Society in Cieszyn. Another part of the collection is approx. 400 catalogue-museum photos that document development of the museum exhibition. In the inter-war period the Museum received a set of photograms from the Museum of School Association in Or≈Çowa that documented the Polish educational system, cultural and educational life as well as folk culture on Zaolzie. * history - comprises almost 14 thousand articles. It was set up at the beginning of the 20th century and in the seventies and focused on the history of Cieszyn Silesia on the basis of the collection of the founder of the museum - father Leopold Szersznik, as well as other exhibits from the last two hundred years. The collection includes, inter alia: pistons and seals of Cieszyn and other towns (starting from Medieval times), badges of various associations, medals and military distinctions, commemorative medals, posters and placards, uniforms, collections of banknotes, militaria, a collection of historic banners. * cartography - composed of 3456 items which are maps and plans created from the second half of the 16th century until contemporary times. The section was set up on the basis of father Szersznik and the collection of the Ethnographic Society, the Town Museum and a bibliophile from Cieszyn Wincenty ZajƒÖc. The oldest objects include chalcographic maps of, inter alia, sky, world, Europe, the countries of the Austrian monarchy, Silesia and Poland. Moreover, the collection includes 19th century cadastral maps of Cieszyn, hand-painted and printed maps of particular parts of Cieszyn Silesia as well as Polish, Austrian, German and Czech maps and atlases of Poland and Europe. * scientific - education section - created in the 1980s. The section organises broadly understood educational events, which are, inter alia: co-operation with schools and educational centres in Cieszyn and outside the city, preparation and giving museum classes, organisation of lectures and discussions concerning operations of the museum and presented exhibitions. * art - comprises 9000 items - mainly the collection of father L.J. Szersznik, the Town Museum, Brunon Konczakowski, the Polish Ethnographic Association (and exhibits obtained and purchased by the Museum) which are: paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings and artistic crafts. The collection of father Szersznik contributed books, minerals and objects related to nature, which are regarded as the most valuable ones. During the interwar period the Museum obtained sacral exhibits from churches located in Cieszyn and the surroundings: altar pictures and sculptures from Ogrodzona, Kisiel√≥w, Pu≈Ñc√≥w, Ochaby, Leszna and Stonawa. * technology - comprises over 800 exhibits, such as kitchen tools, musical instruments, typewriters, lamps, etc. One of the most interesting exhibit is an English bicycle, manufactured in cca. 1880. Most of the exhibits come from the collection of father L.J. Szersznik. Some of them had been used by the clergymen (the musical instruments and astronomical equipment - e.g. Dutch globe dated 1602).

The collection had been a part of the d√©cor of the local churches. These are, inter alia: An altarpiece from Pu≈Ñc√≥w, Ogrodzona, Kamienica, pictures from the castle of Cieszyn, a church in Leszna, the Holy Trinity Church, epitaphs of Bludowski family and Jan ≈ªywiecki, stone and wooden sculptures. Most of the exhibits had not been exhibited due to conservation requirements. This exhibition was opened on 22 May 2016. A permanent exhibition entitled \\"At the crossroads of history and cultures\\" located on the second floor of the Museum occupies a space of over 1000 m2. It covers the period from prehistory to the end of World War II. The exposition is opened by archaeological collection depicting the oldest history of Cieszyn and Cieszyn Silesia. Another part of the collection is related to the period of the Piast dynasty and the reign of the Habsburg family. A part of the exhibition is related to the evolution of the role of the nobility and bourgeoisie over the centuries and the importance of guilds and the development of industry in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Another part of the collection fits in the chronology of the exhibition, inter alia creation of the National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, Polish-Czechoslovak War, the split of the town in 1920, the events of 1938 and World War II. A separate section of the exhibition is devoted to father Jan Leopold Szersznik - the founder of the Museum, and militaria located in the armoury on the first floor.  The Scientific Library of the Museum of Cieszyn Silesia  The Scientific Library of the Museum of Cieszyn Silesia was set up as a museum library along with the creation of the museum in 1901. In 1960 the Museum donated a part of its collection to a newly set up branch of the Silesian Library (currently KsiƒÖ≈ºnica Cieszy≈Ñska). The most precious items of the collection are incunabula and old prints - part of a book collection of a famous collector from Cieszyn, Brunon Konczakowski, and the book collection of a teacher, Wincenty ZajƒÖc. The museum library is meant to be of a reference character for specific departments of the Museum; archaeology, history, technology, history of art, photography. It also includes papers concerning the history of Silesia and Cieszyn Silesia. The library comprises: over 24,000 books, 370 old prints (including 21 incunabula), and several hundred magazines.  Operations of the museum  The Museum organises museum classes related to the following areas of science: * Ethnography: folk pottery - production and decoration techniques, costumes of Cieszyn and highlanders of Silesian Beskids, painted and carved cases - decoration techniques used in folk furniture production, rituals and habits. * Art: the oldest art on the Cieszyn Silesia, father J.L. Szersznik Museum, burghers of Cieszyn - everyday life, art techniques, European decorative art - on the basis of the collection of B. Konczakowski, residences of the nobility of Cieszyn over the centuries. * History: The Duchy of Cieszyn in the Middle Ages, rulers of Cieszyn: Piasts and Habsburgs, nobility and its role in the history of Cieszyn Silesia, the golden era of Cieszyn or urban economic and social development of the town at the beginning of the 20th century, the split of Cieszyn and Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, from euphoria to tragedy - Cieszyn Silesia in the first half of the 20th century, Cieszyn and Cieszyn Silesia in old photographs. The Museum of Cieszyn Silesia is the main organiser of the Cieszyn Night of Museums. The Cieszyn Night of Museums takes place in May, a week after the Krak√≥w and Katowice edition. Once a year, the curator of the Museum of Cieszyn Silesia - Mariusz Makowski, gives a guided tour on the Trail of Blooming Magnolia Trees. The trail was created in 2001 thanks to the initiative of the curator. The walk takes place in spring (a specific date depending on the flowering period of the plants) and takes approx. 1 kilometre, along 11 stops. According to Mariusz Makowski the tradition of walks from magnolia tree to magnolia tree is related to town dwellers who left Cieszyn but used to come back to take this stroll. Since 2003 in the courtyard of the Museum of Cieszyn Silesia and inside the cafeteria Cafe Muzeum (located in the former palace stable) so-called artistic fairs have been organised. They take place a few times per month before Christmas. In September in the courtyard of the Museum and the Park of Peace a cyclical outdoor event is organised. It is called: Cieszyn layer cake ‚Äì that is to say what is this tradition all about? The event is directed to children and young people and informs them about some traditions of Cieszyn Silesia.  Branches of the museum  Apart from the permanent exhibition At the Crossroads of History and Culture, the Museum offers temporary exhibitions of varied themes. The branches of the Museum are located in the following places: * Zofia Kossak- Szatkowska Museum in G√≥rki Wielkie * Gustaw Morcinek Museum in Skocz√≥w * Beskids Museum of Andrzej Pod≈ºorski in Wis≈Ça File:POL G√≥rki Wielkie Muzeum Zofii Kossak 1.JPGZofia Kossak-Szatkowska Museum in G√≥rki Wielkie File:POL Skocz√≥w Fabryczna 5 - Muzeum im.

The children put on exhibitions of cultural dance while wearing tribal regalia for audiences across Southern California. The aim of the program is to preserve traditions and culture through education of Native American youth. History The Soaring Eagles Dance Group was founded by Vickie Gambala in 2008. The group was created by Gambala and her parents to do something for the children and community in order to bring together Native people who are not connected to their reservation. At first the classes took place in a community hall in North Park but eventually grew and moved to the Ballard Parent Center in Old Town, San Diego. These classes include speakers and potlucks to bring the community together. The group was created to teach children and Native culture, how to dance the powwow, and how to design and make tribal regalia. It was founded on the mission to heal and strengthen traditional American tribal family values and preserve traditions and culture through diversity and education of Native American youth. Chuck Cadotte has been with the group since the creation and is the main Staff Instructor. Cadotte instructs a weekly powwow dance class and teaches American Indian Youth traditions through these dance classes.  Approach  The Soaring Eagles community, parents, children, and teachers support each other in dance, school, and extracurricular activities. The program stresses the importance of family, community, and communication. The dance classes are about more than teaching children to dance;they make sure the students understand what goes on at a powwow and how to culturally participate. The Soaring Eagles dances symbolize the artistic and nature- influenced spirituality that has been based down through Native history.  Events  The Soaring Eagles performed and participated at the SCAIR Tribal Urban Awards on the Viejas Dreamcatcher theater stage in 2009. At the 40th annual Barona Powwow on September 5, 2010 a La Mesa sixth-grader, part of the Soaring Eagles, did a dance for a group of Native American Youth. The Barona powwow was a social event with dance competitions and food tasting. Amount the performances and competitions the Soaring Eagles performed for the attendees . At the 4th annual South Bayfront Powwow dance and ceremony on August 2, 2015, The Soaring Eagles performed the Gourd Dance- the first of many performances to come. The event spanned over two days and celebrated Native American culture through dances, songs, prayers, etc. Powwows like the South Bayfront Powwow are community events that feel like family gatherings. Everyone is welcome to join in the festivities and watch the Soaring Eagles perform. The Soaring Eagles participated in the 37th Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Parade in 2017. They were accompanied by Green River Singers and the San Diego Inter- Tribal Youth Council.  Media  ‚ÄúSoaring Eagles‚Äù is a student-produced documentary about the cultural and education program of San Diego Unified School District‚Äôs Indian Education Program. In 2011 the documentary won the Award of Merit from The Indie Fest for its coverage of participants, testimonials and footage from traditional American Indian dance exhibitions.  Awards  The Soaring Eagles placed in 3rd at the San Diego Martin Luther King Day Parade in January 2010. The Soaring Eagles had four winners at the Barona Powwow in 2010: Baltazar Jackson, Violet Decrane, Richard Decrane, and SDAIHC-Charlene Redner.

This species is often mistaken for Monomorium minimum as they are similar in appearance. This ant is a shiny black color and contains only a single worker caste, making them a monomorphic species. It is also polygyne, meaning a colony contains multiple fertile queens living together. They are native to California, Nevada, and Utah and are usually found in cities or on the coast (in California also being found on islands near the coast). When compared to other Monomorium species, they are found to have the longest living queens and can live up 2 years in captivity. Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) have been discovered to be actively pushing this species out of its original territory. Some speculation as to the difference between the island species and the coastal mainland species in California has been brought up. A few argue that the mainland species aren't actually ergatogyna but a different species or subspecies, they point to the size difference of island queens and mainland queens. Another point is that mainland species appear to be allopatric, but more evidence must be brought forward to prove this point. thumb thumb References Further reading * External links * Category:Monomorium Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Insects described in 1904 ","title":"Monomorium ergatogyna"},{"id":"57351197","text":"Paratettix brevipennis, the short-winged pygmy grasshopper, is a species of pygmy grasshopper in the family Tetrigidae.

The bee's current known range is on the barrier islands and coastal mainland secondary dunes on the Gulf Coast of the United States in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Gulf Coast solitary bee is the only known member of its subfamily in the eastern United States, and it is a monolege of the coastal plain honeycomb head (Balduina angustifolia). Taxonomy  Hesperapis oraria is a member of the insect order Hymenoptera, family Melittidae, subfamily Dasypodainae, tribe Hesperapini,Hedtke SM, Patiny S, Danforth BN. 2013. The bee tree of life: a supermatrix approach to apoid phylogeny and biogeography. BMC Evolutionary Biology 13:138. p. 7. genus Hesperapis, subgenus Carinapis, or the Carinata group. The genus name Hesperapis is derived from the words ‚Äúevening‚Äù and ‚Äúbee‚Äù and the species name oraria is Latin meaning of the ‚Äúcoast or shore‚Äù.Cane JH, Snelling RR, Kervin LJ. 1997.

Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society 69:238‚Äì247. p. 242. It is regarded as a valid species in the United States within the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Description The Gulf Coast solitary bee appears to be monolectic, only gathering pollen and nectar from one floral host, the coastal plain honeycomb head, Balduina angustifolia. Females of the Gulf Coast solitary bee are 11-13mm in length, while males are smaller at 8.5-11mm long; both sexes have shiny black heads with many hairs, plumose or hairy yellowish mesosomas with clear to brownish wings and hairy dark brown to reddish legs.Cane JH, Snelling RR, Kervin LJ. 1997.

Males can further be distinguished from females by their distinctive subtriangular pygidial plate that ends in a point, whereas female pygidial plates are broad with points greater than 45¬∞. Overall, bodies of both sexes are covered in dense hairs and metasomas have alternating dark and light colored bands. Melittidae is hypothesized to be the basal group of all bees, with the Dasypodainae the basal most branch in a recently constructed phylogeny.Hedtke SM, Patiny S, Danforth BN. 2013.

There are other named 39 species found in xeric grasslands and deserts in western North America. Natural History =Life Cycle and Behavior= Adult Gulf Coast solitary bee activity coincides with the bloom of its pollen host, the coastal plain honeycomb head, in September and October.Cane JH, Snelling RR, Kervin LJ. 1997.

In their few weeks as adults, female bees build underground nests and lay eggs after mating. Females provision a brood cell with a ball of pollen upon which one egg is laid and left to hatch and develop into likely five instars.Rozen Jr JG. 1987.

Emergence dynamics and bet hedging in a desert bee, Perdita portalis. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 266:1985‚Äì1994. p. 1986. Male Gulf Coast solitary bees often sleep on and patrol flowers of the honeycomb head for females and have been observed to attempt matings at the flowers; however as none of those observed mating attempts were successful, it is assumed that the majority of mating occurs at nest sites. Alternatively, patrolling males may have a low success rate and mating does indeed occur near host plants, such as at the base of the plants.Rozen Jr JG. 1987. Nesting biology and immature stages of a new species in the bee genus Hesperapis (Hymenoptera, Apoidea, Melittidae, Dasypodinae). American Museum novitates; no. 2887. p. 6. Males also rest on flowers during severe weather.Cane JH. 1997. Violent weather and bees: populations of the barrier island endemic, Hesperapis oraria (Hymenoptera: Melittidae) survive a category 3 hurricane. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society 70:73‚Äì75. p. 73. The activity of males on the flowers contributes to the bee's efficacy as a pollinator of the coastal plain honeycomb head. While the nesting biology of the Gulf Coast solitary bee has not been specifically described, the 14 members of the Carinata group (subgenus of Hesperapis) have nests associated with soft sand, such as on dunes.Cane JH, Snelling RR, Kervin LJ. 1997. A new monolectic coastal bee, Hesperapis oraria Snelling and Stage (Hymenoptera: Melittidae), with a review of desert and neotropical disjunctives in the southeastern US. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society 69:238‚Äì247. p. 244. Female Gulf Coast solitary bees have modified hind basitarsi setae that form a trough-like depression used to excavate nests in sandy soils. Other members of the subgenus have been found to nest in aggregate, with upwards of 25 burrows/m2 in the sandy soil and each burrow housing one to six individual larval cells within a 30 cm radius and around 25‚Äì30 cm deep.Rozen Jr JG. 1987. Nesting biology and immature stages of a new species in the bee genus Hesperapis (Hymenoptera, Apoidea, Melittidae, Dasypodinae). American Museum novitates; no. 2887. p. 3. Larval cells of Hesperapis are not lined by the female and the larvae do not spin cocoons; however, post-defecating larvae have been found to be coated in a rigid integument-like material that may regulate moisture.Rozen Jr JG. 2016. Hesperapis rhodocerata: behavioral biology, egg, and larval instars, including behavioral and larval comparisons with H. larreae (Hymenoptera: Melittidae: Dasypodainae). American Museum Novitates:1‚Äì19. p. 7-8. The Gulf Coast solitary bee may exhibit bet hedging, or a reproductive strategy that reduces between year variance in reproductive success and increases overall survival in ecosystems with unpredictable annual weather conditions. In response to unpredictable habitat, bees often enter extended diapause for two or three years, delaying emergence until blooms of their host plants. Monolectic bees do not switch pollen sources if they emerge when their host plant is not in bloom and so have evolved synchrony in emergence time with the blooming period of the plants, using environmental cues for emergence. At least one congener, Hesperapis rhodocerata, has been shown to exhibit extended diapause, not emerging until sufficient rainfall resulted in blooms of the preferred pollen host.Rozen Jr JG. 2016. Hesperapis rhodocerata: behavioral biology, egg, and larval instars, including behavioral and larval comparisons with H. larreae (Hymenoptera: Melittidae: Dasypodainae). American Museum Novitates:1‚Äì19. p. 2-4. =Habitat= When described, the Gulf Coast solitary bee was only found on secondary dunes behind fore dunes on barrier islands and coastal shores within 2‚Äì3 km from the shoreline, but it is now known only within 500m from the shoreline.Thetford M, Miller D. 2015a. Determining population status of newly-discovered bee species and single-floral host, Balduina angustifolia on NW Florida Barrier Islands. Page 5. Final Report. Gulf Coast Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit. Barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico are long and narrow bands of sand that run parallel to the shore from two miles west of Alabama to Destin, Florida in the east.Hunsberger HK. 2013. Distribution and habitat use of Florida endemic solitary bee Hesperapis oraria and how plant Balduina angustifolia. University of Florida, Milton, FL. The islands and coastal areas consist of foredunes that break waves coming off of the Gulf and secondary dunes behind foredunes, with grasslands and temporary wetlands in the swales; on wider sections of the islands, such as on Perdido Key, the vegetation in the secondary dunes becomes wood scrub forest. As the Gulf Coast solitary bee is monolectic and does not switch host plants, its habitat must consist of both dense patches of its sole pollen host, the Coastal Plain honeycombhead, as well as appropriate nesting substrate within flight range of the plants. The Gulf Coast solitary bee use patches of the honeycombhead less than 475m from the coastline and, as the plant prefers habitat greater than 110m from the shore, the bee can most likely be found between 110-475m from the Gulf coastline. On a regional scale, the bee requires at least 12 patches of the honeycombhead per site and on a landscape scale requires the area of the patches be at least 111.5m2, or at least 2.5 plants per m2. In 2011-2012, the bee was found in higher densities on the coastal mainland sites which had three times the number of honeycomb head patches compared to the barrier islands. The bee is not found at stands of honeycomb head on non-coastal mainland sites even those with dense patches of the honeycomb head. As the Gulf Coast solitary bee's range is much smaller than the honeycomb head, its habitat is restricted by several other factors, most likely bare areas of fine sandy soil for nesting as well as the intermediate disturbances needed to maintain the bee's dune habitat. Dune habitat is dynamic and disturbance dependent and so constantly changing due to forces of wind, water, storms, and fire, which has led to naturally patchy distribution of the honeycomb head and other vegetation on the dune ecosystem. The bee and plant are found in higher densities on the coastal mainland sites, potentially due to reduced high intensity storm disturbance in these areas. In addition, low intensity fires are a common and natural component of these ecosystems that maintains bare ground and patchy vegetation. The bee's coastal and island habitats are separated from the non-coastal mainland patches of honeycomb head by development or dense scrubland that has built up due to suppression of natural fire, reducing habitat connectivity. As such, the Gulf Coast solitary bee and its host plant appear to require a moderate level of disturbance in their naturally shifting dune habitats. Nests of the Gulf Coast solitary bees are in the deep, soft sandy soils found in their dune habitats, are potentially no more than 2 km from the shore, as they are restricted to the crumbly sands in back-dune habitats; although considering where the adult bees are found, the nests are more likely around 500m from the gulf shore. Nesting resources are key factors in solitary bee population viability; however, Gulf Coast solitary bee nests are difficult to locate and proxy measurements of fine sandy soil with bare ground and host plant proximity can be used to quantify nesting site availability and habitat quality.Sardinas HS, Kremen C. 2014. Evaluating nesting microhabitat for ground-nesting bees using emergence traps. Basic and Applied Ecology 15:161‚Äì168. p 162. Indeed, a Gulf Coast solitary female has been recorded digging a burrow in fine sand within the largest patch of honeycomb head in the area on Fort Pickens.Thetford M, Miller D. 2015a. Determining population status of newly-discovered bee species and single-floral host, Balduina angustifolia on NW Florida Barrier Islands. Page 13. Final Report. Gulf Coast Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit. Historic and Current Distribution The Gulf Coast solitary bee is narrowly distributed and its historic known range is a narrow strip along the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico and extends linearly around 320 km from Horn Island in eastern Mississippi to St. Andrew's Bay in northwestern Florida within the states of Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. Despite extensive surveys for the bee throughout the region, even within dense patches of its host plant, the coastal plains honeycomb head, which also occur in the Florida peninsula and southern Georgia, the bee was only found in sites within 1‚Äì2 km of the coast in 1996, when it was described. Further, the Gulf Coast solitary bee was not found on small barrier islands containing its host plant, such as Petit Bois Island in Mississippi, nor on islands or areas without the honeycomb head (Dauphin Island, Alabama and Crooked Islands, and Shell Islands, Florida). The Gulf Coast solitary bee has not been surveyed outside of Florida since the original description, and thus has not been seen in Mississippi or Alabama since 1994.Cornelisse, T. M., and J. A. Tyler. 2019. Petition to List the Gulf Coast Solitary Bee (Hesperapis oraria) Under the Endangerend Species Act and Concurrently Designate Critical Habitat. Center for Biological Diversity, Portland, Oregon. Conservation The Gulf Coast solitary bee has been recognized as imperiled or needing protection by international and state entities. It has a NatureServe ranking of G1 or critically imperiled from 2007 and all known occurrences may be in danger from development and hurricanes.NatureServe. 2018. Hesperapis oraria. NatureServe Explorer: An online encyclopedia of life [web application]. Version 7.0. NatureServe, Arlington, VA. U.S.A. Available from http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Hesperapis+oraria (accessed January 23, 2019). According to NatureServe, as of 2007, the bee is extirpated or likely extirpated from Choctawhatchee Bay and Pensacola Bay (NatureServe 2018 p. 2). The Gulf Coast solitary bee is state ranked as S1/S2, or critically imperiled/imperiled in Florida because of extreme rarity or vulnerability to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor by the Florida Natural Areas Inventory; however, it is not listed as a Florida Endangered Species or Species of Special Concern so is not formally protected by the state of Florida. It has no federal endangered species protection. It was petitioned for federal endangered species act protections in 2019.

Elliott (1945-2007) was an American police officer and founder of Gwen's Girls, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the improving the lives of at-risk young women and girls. She was a member of the first group of women to serve as Pittsburgh Police officers and was that department's first black female commander.  Early life  Gwen was born in Duquesne, Pennsylvania and graduated from West Mifflin High School. Gwen's mother, Vivian Campbell, died when Gwen was five years old due to an incorrectly performed abortion. Gwen graduated from West Mifflin High School and earned an associate degree from Community College of Allegheny County.  Career  In 1964 Gwen joined the United States Air Force where she served for five years, retiring as a staff sergeant. She later served in the National Guard and the Air Force Reserve for a total of fifteen years of service in the United States Armed Forces. While stationed in the southern United States she experienced racial segregation as well as gender segregation as part of military life. Following the active-duty portion of her career in the military, Gwen worked as a mental health professional. Then, seeking a field with greater funding stability, she went to apply for a job with the United States Postal Service. While at the post office to apply for a job, someone there remarked that she had good qualifications to apply for a job with the police department. In 1975 a federal judge issued an order that created minimum quotas for white women, black women, and black men hired by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. In 1976 Gwen began her career with the Pittsburgh police along with 11 other women, the department's first female officers. In 1986 she became the department's first black female commander. Gwen was a determined and goal-oriented officer. In a story published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gwen is quoted as saying > \\"At no period was I ready to give up. I never thought about quitting. Those > men who didn't cooperate with us in the early years made us smarter quicker. > I was determined I was going to feed my babies, I was going to succeed.\\" Her determination inspired others on the force. In a 2012 Point Park University Alumni Profile, then Assistant Chief of Investigations for the Pittsburgh Police Maurita Bryant is quoted as saying of Elliott > ‚ÄúShe cared about everyone. She would give you the shirt off her back. She > was smart as a whip. No matter how much people talked about her or tried to > demean her, she kept her head up. She kept going.\\" While serving on the police force Gwen was determined to find a way to improve the quality of life of the young women and girls who came to the attention of the police. She wanted to help not only these young women and girls, but also their children and subsequent generations. Gwen retired from the police department in 2002 after 26 years of service, and in the same year she founded Gwen's Girls, a nonprofit organization dedicated solely to the needs of at- risk young women and girls. After retirement, she also continued to mentor women police officers and served as an adjunct professor at Point Park University. She served on dozens of boards and received many women's leadership and public service awards.  Death  Gwendolyn J. Elliott died from cancer on May 14, 2007 at age sixty-two in her home in the Highland Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

After a pre-London provincial tour it ran at the Savoy Theatre for 60 performances from 1 February 1923. The play portrays the successful manoeuvring by two young adults to prise their father away from his unsympathetic second wife and reunite him with his first wife, their mother. Background Coward had one play produced before The Young Idea. I'll Leave It to You, a light comedy, was given in Manchester and then London in 1920, achieving a total of 61 performances. In 1921 Coward was appearing at the St James's Theatre, London, in Polly With a Past, a comedy by George Middleton and Guy Bolton. It ran for several months, and Coward, who always found long runs boring, diverted himself by writing a new play. On his own admission it drew heavily on Bernard Shaw's You Never Can Tell. Concerned that the characters Gerda and Sholto were too similar to the twins Dolly and Philip in Shaw's comedy, Coward arranged for Shaw to be sent a copy of his new play. Shaw made numerous helpful suggestions but advised Coward \\"never to see or read my plays. Unless you can get clean away from me you will begin as a back number, and be hopelessly out of it when you are forty.\\"Holroyd, p. 98 In June 1922 the producer Robert Courtneidge took up an option on Coward's play and mounted a tour of it, beginning in Bristol, directing it himself. He then presented it at the Savoy Theatre, London, for a run of 60 performances, from 1 February 1923.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 19 and 23 Roles and original cast *George Brent ‚Äì Herbert Marshall *Gerda (his daughter) ‚Äì Ann Trevor *Sholto (his son) ‚Äì No√´l Coward *Jennifer (his first wife, divorced) ‚Äì Kate Cutler *Cicely (his second wife) ‚Äì Muriel Pope *Rodney Masters ‚Äì Martin Lewis (tour); Leslie Banks (Savoy) *Priscilla Hartleberry ‚Äì Phyllis Black *Claud Eccles ‚Äì Ronald Ward *Julia Cragworthy ‚Äì Naomi Jacob *Eustace Dabbit ‚Äì Clive Currie *Sybil Blaith ‚Äì Mollie Maitland *Hiram J Walkin ‚Äì Ambrose Manning *Huddle (the butler) ‚Äì Walter Thompson *Maria (Italian servant at villa) ‚Äì Irene Rathbone Plot =Act I= ;The hall of George Brent's country house. Roddy Masters, a neighbour, is in love with George Brent's wife, Cicely. George walks in on the two, to find them in passionate embrace. He pretends not to have noticed, but after Roddy has left he takes Cicely to task, telling her that although he no longer loves her, he is not prepared to have a scandal. The exchange does nothing to ameliorate relations between the couple, which are already strained because George has invited Sholto and Gerda ‚Äì his children from his first marriage ‚Äì to stay with them. The young people, who have been brought up on the Continent by George's ex-wife, Jennifer, arrive full of high spirits. They bring out two large photographs of their mother in her garden at Alassio, and, unnoticed by his father, Sholto puts them on the mantelpiece. A group of house-party guests of the Brents enter. The photographs of Jennifer prompt a discussion of George and Cicely's private lives. Cicely appears and is annoyed to see the photographs. George, much amused, makes Gerda and Sholto take them down. Roddy returns, with the news that his only brother has died in Jamaica, and he himself will be going there to take over his plantation. Gerda and Sholto see Cicely's agitation at this, and as she has been unwelcoming and unfriendly towards them they determine that they are going to get some fun out of their visit. =Act II= ;The same Scene 1 The guests are gathered in the hall after dinner, dressed for a hunt ball. The others leave and Sholto and Gerda try to clear things up with Cicely, asking her why she dislikes them so much. She makes a hostile reply and leaves them; they decide to act on of their suspicions that she is having an affair with Roddy. Their first move is to enlist the sympathies of once of the guests, Priscilla Hartleberry, by representing themselves as objects of compassion: they spin Priscilla a yarn about their mother, saying that she eloped with an Italian Count and now drinks heavily, a mistake they say they want to stop Cicely from making. The innocent Priscilla is on the verge of telling them what she knows about Cicely and Roddy when they are interrupted. Getting their father alone, the young people try to rekindle his affection for his ex-wife. They tell him that every year she revisits the scenes of their honeymoon. He tells them emphatically that he is no longer in love with Jennifer and is perfectly content with his life as an English country gentleman. They try to persuade him of the delights of a journey to Italy, but he is adamant that he will stick with Cicely as long as she sticks with him. Gerda replies that case she and Sholto will take matters into their own hands. The arrival of their stepmother drives them from the room. Cicely complains to George of the children's rudeness to her; he stands up for them and there is a fierce quarrel. When he leaves she is in such a rage that, when Roddy asks her to go away with him, she is completely willing. They agree to drive to London overnight, and sail from Liverpool the next day. The curtain falls as they embrace. Scene 2 At half-past two in the morning, Sholto and Gerda have returned from the ball ahead of the other guests. They hear a car and see Cicely and Roddy get out. Hiding behind the curtains, they hear Cicely say that she has left a note for George and is going to fetch her luggage. The young people are delighted, but another car brings their father with Priscilla, who has warned him of the elopement. Still hiding, the young people watch the scene that develops as George confronts the eloping couple. He calmly points out to his wife that life in British colonial society for a woman living with a man to whom she is not married will be highly unpleasant. He adds that she does not really love Roddy, but is merely bored and resentful, which is a very bad reason for eloping. Cicely is wavering when Sholto and Gerda rush in and contrive to tip the balance by imploring her not to go, because \\"we're going to stay here always\\".Coward, p. 939 She repulses them furiously and goes out with Roddy. They forget their luggage, and so Sholto and Gerda rush out after them carrying a suitcase each. =Act III= ;Jennifer Brent's villa at Alassio, Italy. Jennifer Brent is wakened from her siesta by her maid, Maria, announcing a visitor, Jennifer's American admirer Hiram J. Walkin. He has come with a large bunch of flowers to propose to her. He has done so before, without success, but this time she accepts him. She admits that she does not love him, but she thinks her children need a man's influence. Maria excitedly announces that the carriage bringing the children home is approaching, and Jennifer asks her suitor to wait in another room until she has broken the news to them. After a joyous reunion, the young people say they have a surprise for her; she replies that she has one for them and tells them about her suitor. They conceal their dismay and, while she is fetching him, they quickly decide a plan of action. Mr Walkin is startled to find that the \\"children\\", whom he had imagined to be about twelve, are more or less grown-up. They tell him that their father is not divorced at all, but is a lunatic, and that their mother's sanity is doubtful. At the end of this tale George himself enters, and is introduced by Sholto as \\"Mr Peasemarsh\\". Gerda then launches into another preposterous story, but Mr Walkin cuts it short, remarking that he is not half-witted and can see what they are trying to do: \\"If you didn't want me to marry your mother, why the hell couldn't you say so?\\"Coward, p. 952 He leaves, offended.Coward, p. 954 Jennifer, upset by events, starts to have a row with George, while the young people slip away. The realisation dawns, first on George and then on Jennifer, that they still love each other. He exclaims, \\"Come and kiss me!\\", and going to him she replies, \\"George! You haven't altered a bit!\\".Coward, p. 957 Revivals and adaptations The play was revived at the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage, in North London in July 1931 and transferred to the St Martin's Theatre in the West End the following month, running for a total of 81 performances. Cecil Parker played George Brent, Ann Trevor was again Gerda and Arthur Macrae played Sholto.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 19 Critical reception James Agate wrote of the first production, \\"One remembers Mr Noel Coward's first play as a very light and entirely admirable comedy. His second, The Young Idea, at the Savoy Theatre, if you examine it closely, reaches after more than it can grasp‚Äîa good fault in a young writer ‚Ä¶ exhilarating and great fun\\", although he thought Coward had yet to balance plausible realism and theatrical effect.Quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 21‚Äì22 In 2006 the actor and writer Simon Callow called The Young Idea \\"a remarkable play, alternately vivacious and painful, expressing all the young Coward's restless, almost violent, impulsiveness\\".Callow, Simon. \\"Englishman abroad\\", The Guardian, 19 April 2006 References and sources =References= =Sources=  * Category:Plays by No√´l Coward Category:1921 plays Category:British plays Category:West End plays ","title":"The Young Idea"},{"id":"57351575","text":"Southern Hotel on the southwest corner of Fourth and Walnut Streets, 1868 The Southern Hotel was a historic hotel located at the corner of 4th Street and Walnut Street and stretching between 4th and 5th Streets in St. Louis, Missouri. The building was built at the location of the Old Southern Hotel which burned in 1877. This 1877 hotel fire and the loss of life that occurred here made this the worst hotel disaster in St. Louis history. The new Southern Hotel had white marble, extensive fresco work, a rotunda, and a wide promenade. The hotel was owned by Robert G. Campbell who had a close friendship with President Grant.

The Nazis referred to Lewis as \\"the most dangerous Jew in Los Angeles.\\"  Early life  Lewis was the son of Edward and Rachel Lewis, German Jewish immigrants who migrated to Wisconsin. He grew up in Milwaukee and attended the University of Wisconsin and George Washington University. Lewis received a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1913.  Career  After graduating from law school, Lewis accepted the position of national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League, and began to work on discrimination cases in the Midwest. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Lewis enlisted and served in the Army infantry and Army intelligence in Germany, France, and England during and after the war, rising to the rank of major. In 1919 he returned to the U.S. and resumed his work fighting Antisemitism for the ADL in Chicago and other parts of the Midwestern United States. Lewis and his family moved to Los Angeles in the late 1920s, where he founded the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (later known as the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, Community Relations Committee), from which he launched a major anti-Nazi spy ring and intelligence gathering operation, receiving funding from all of the Hollywood studio moguls and working in cooperation with local and federal authorities. With help from his assistant Joseph Roos, Lewis' work as spymaster resulted in the successful prosecution of multiple American Nazis before and during World War II, and the prevention of many acts of Nazi sabotage and assassinations on the West Coast of the United States. Lewis served as executive director of the Community Relations Committee for 17 years, after which he returned to his law practice.  Personal Life  Lewis married Ruth Lowenberg in 1920, and the couple had two daughters, Rosemary Mazlo (1922‚Äì1980) and Claire Read (1928‚Äì2015). He died of a heart attack on May 21, 1954 in Pacific Palisades, California.  Legacy  Lewis' personal and professional papers are archived in the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, Community Relations Committee Collection held at the Oviatt Library at California State University, Northridge.

It is located near the town centre and it is one of the town attractions.  History  An old picture of the Bastiuni Piazza Bagolino seen from the public garden At the beginning of the 17th century there was only a small flat area called Terra Nova or San Francesco,Pietro Maria Rocca, Delle muraglie e porte della citt√† di Alcamo, Palermo, Tipografia Lo Statuto, 1894 then by order of the governor of Alcamo, Don Pietro Balsamo, they began the works for the opening of Corso 6 Aprile. The part underlying the square was used for the extraction of Calcarenite, and there were many caves that were once employed as dwellings, and later, thanks to their favourable temperature, for the processing of calfskins.Roberto Calia, I palazzi dell'aristocrazia e della borghesia alcamese, Alcamo, Carrubba, 1997. As people used the area for a dumping ground, it was necessary a work of consolidation and settling in order to avoid landslides: it was made according to the project of the engineer Fra Cipolla from Nicosia in the early 19th century.Vincenzo Regina, Ottocento alcamese: storia e arte; Accademia di studi Cielo D'Alcamo;, Trapani, Cartograf, 1977. In 1930 they realized the walls of the bastion and restored and fenced the small garden, called Villa Margherita of Savoy at that time: they also planted several trees and flowers, placing a rounded pond. The next year there was a flood which provoked a landslide, but only in 1946 they consolidated the square, in order to protect the front houses too. During this phase they made the drainage and reinforcement works, realized the staircase leading to Parco suburbano San Francesco, and settled the square by planting some trees and make the flooring, together with minor works. In 1950 they also added a travertine parapet, from which we can admire the beautilful landscape of Gulf of Castellammare and placed some benches, while on the west side (after Palazzo Mistretta-Galati) they placed the bust of the famous poet Sebastiano Bagolino realized by Giuseppe Bambina, a sculptor from Alcamo; another bust, representing the scientist Girolamo Caruso, was located at the entrance of the public garden. Finally, in 2012, the square was restored again, in the present form, by the municipal administration led by the Lord Mayor Giacomo Scala. = Description = The garden inside Piazza Bagolino Piazza Bagolino is located on the east side of the town; there is the widest car park: you can leave your car here, either in the square or in the underground car-park that was realized in 2012. Together with Piazza Ciullo and Piazza della Repubblica, it is one of the largest squares in Alcamo leading into Corso 6 Aprile; here you can admire two magnificent bas-riliefs realized by Nicola Rubino, a sculptor from Alcamo, in 1961 and representing \\"The poet Cielo d'Alcamo at the court of Frederick II\\" and \\"Active life of Alcamo\\", portrayed through a rural scene with symbolic figures. The work was commissioned to the sculptor by the senator Ludovico Corrao, the Lord Mayor of that time. On the left of Porta Palermo there is the garden entitled to Bagolino, with some imposing trees; opposite to it there is the entrance of Parco suburbano San Francesco, rich with different plants typical of the Mediterranean flora. From Piazza Bagolino, also called Belvedere, you can enjoy one of the most picturesque landscapes of the sweet hills of Alcamo countryside, with the geometrical lines drawn by rows of vineyards, olive trees and characteristic baglios in the distance.http://www.turismo.trapani.it/it/1027/piazza-bagolino.html The place is not properly enlighted, but actually the strong point is its belvedere: on 21 June, during the feast of Madonna of Miracles (the Patroness of Alcamo), it is the best placet o look at fireworks. From Piazza Bagolino you can enter Corso 6 Aprile and, in few minutes, reach the town centre on foot. Parco suburbano San Francesco This park is a public garden located below the bastion of Piazza Bagolino. It has an area of about 12,000 square metres; it is a wonderful garden with very different types of plants and tree, typical of the Mediterranean macchia. As soon as you enter it, on the right you can see the tree in memory of the two carabinieris killed on 27 January 1976 in the Alcamo Marina Massacre: Carmine Apuzzo and Salvatore Falcetta.

The poem describes the laments for and burial of the dead from the Nibelungenlied, as well as the spread of the news of the catastrophe that ended the other poem, as well as the fates of the various characters who survived. It was likely written at around the same time as the Nibelungenlied (c. 1200), and is appended to it as though it were another episode (√¢ventiure). Summary The poem begins with a long lamentation by the narrator about the events of the Nibelungenlied, followed by a summary of the events of the earlier poems. This includes a genealogy of the main characters and their relationships to each other. Then Siegfried's marriage to Kriemhild, his murder, and the revenge of his widow are recounted. The narrator asserts that Kriemhild is innocent because she was motivated by her love to her dead husband, whereas her relatives the Burgundians needed to be punished. He further asserts that if it had been possible, Kriemhild would have only killed Hagen. If, the narrator continues, Kriemhild had revealed her plan, then the slaughter in Etzel's hall could have been avoided. The narrator then lists the dead, emphasizing that Giselher is innocent and Gunther is partially innocent. The Hunnish prince Ortlieb is lamented as well as Kriemhild by the Huns. The survivors begin to recover the dead, with every corpse causing great lamenting by relatives and friends. Dietrich von Bern and Etzel remain horrified and insist that everything would have been different if only they had known or avoided one thing or another. There are so many corpses that there are not enough men at Etzel's court to disarm them, women have to help. Hildebrand faints from sorrow when he finds R√ºdiger's corpse, and Etzel has to revive him. Etzel then collapses himself. Once all of the dead have been removed, Etzel comes to and laments at length, expressing his despair and his desire to leave the world. Etzel then sends the minstrel Swemmel as a messenger to Worms via Bechelaren, R√ºdiger's home. Even though Swemmel is not to say anything before he reaches Worms, his grief is easily spotted. R√ºdiger's wife Gotelind and his daughter Dietlind quickly realize that something has happened to R√ºdiger, and so Swemmel tells them the story. In Passau, the messenger informs Bishop Pilgrim, who is related to the Burgundian kings. Pilgrim orders a requiem mass sung and asks the messengers to return to Passau so that he can have everything that's happened written down. Pilgrim also asks other eyewitnesses at Etzel's court for information. Swemmel finally reaches Worms and reports to Br√ºnhild and the court, where the lamentations are very great. The mother of the Burgundians, Ute, dies of grief. After a time of mourning Br√ºnhild's son Siegfried is crowned the new king of the Burgundians. Meanwhile, Dietrich and Hildebrand decide to return to Dietrich's kingdom in northern Italy. Etzel remains alone in his despair, and the narrator asserts that he does not know what happened to the Hunnish king. The narrator asserts that there are several rumors about Etzel's fate. Dietrich arrives in Bechelaren to discover that R√ºdiger's widow Gotelind has died of grief, but Dietrich promises to find Dietlind a new husband once he has returned to Italy. In an epilogue, it is explained that Bishop Pilgrim ordered the events of the Nibelungenlied and the Klage to be written down in Latin by a \\"meister Konrad\\", from which it has since been translated to German. Origins The Klage is transmitted together with the Nibelungenlied in all but two manuscripts and is appended to the end as if it were a final episode. The poem may have likely composed in the same context as the Nibelungenlied, according to the prevailing theory by Joachim Bumke this was in a sort of \\"Nibelungen workshop\\" (\\"Nibelungenwerkstatt\\") in Passau around 1200, under the auspices of Bishop Wolfger von Erla). This theory is complicated by the fact that the end of the Nibelungenlied clearly does not envision the Klage, meaning it cannot have been planned from the beginning of that epic's composition. According to Jan-Dirk M√ºller, the only thing that can be said for certain about the Klage's composition relative to the Nibelungenlied is that it took place before very early in the manuscript transmission of the latter work. Although the poem seems to have been written in close proximity to the Nibelungenlied, stylistic and linguistic differences make it clear that it was not written by the same author. Although the beginning of the Klage emphasizes that it is the beginning of a new work, the layout of the manuscripts presents it as a mere continuation of the Nibelungenlied. Due to deviations from the Nibelungenlied in the Klage's recapitulation of the events of that poem, older scholarship sometimes supposed that the two works had been written independently of each other or even that the Klage was the earlier of the two. M√ºller prefers to see the Klage as reacting to the oral tradition behind the Nibelungenlied in many respects rather than to the specific version offered by the poem. According to the Klage itself, a Latin version of the events of the Klage and Nibelungenlied was written down by a certain \\"meister Konrad\\" on behalf of Bishop Pilgrim of Passau immediately after the events of the poem. There is no evidence for the existence of a Latin version and so this is usually taken as a narrative fiction. Pilgrim appears to be inspired by the historical figure of Pilgrim of Passau (flourished 971-991), who was an important ecclesiastical prince and whose family shows possible connections to the Nibelung material in its use of names from the Nibelung tradition. It is possible that Pilgrim is made to be the original source of the poem as an oblique reference to Wolfger von Erla. The overall purpose of this claim for a Latin version based on eye- witness accounts seems to be to vouch for the authenticity of the tradition and of the poem, while also providing it with the dignity of the learned language Latin. It may also seek to make the story seem plausible and believable in some way. Form and style The Klage is written in rhyming couplets, rather than the stanzas of the Nibelungenlied. The rhyming technique is nevertheless very similar to that of the Nibelungenlied, however the language is much simpler and can even be described as monotonous. The poem nevertheless makes use of shocking metaphors and images to describe the nature of death and the piles of the dead from the previous poem. It is generally viewed as an inferior work when compared with the Nibelungenlied. Interpretation The Klage is widely viewed as an attempt to come to terms with the finality of the tragedy that closes the Nibelungenlied. The poem is unique as regards its genre, as it consists more of a commentary on another poem than as a narrative. The title Klage could be a translation of the Latin planctus, coming from the notion that after a tragedy follows a cathartic lament. The use of rhyming couplets and the general tendency of the work is most similar to a poem relaying historical events, as various elements similar to courtly romance found in the Nibelungenlied are not included in the Klage. The Klage offers a specific interpretation of the events of the Nibelungenlied, which it accomplishes by commenting on the plot of the other poem in laments, reports, and recapitulations of events, both in the voice of the narrator and of the characters of the poem. The narrator makes clear distinctions between good and bad and can even say with certainty which dead figures went to Heaven and which to Hell. It defends Kriemhild and accentuates her loyalty and love to Siegfried while denigrating others, especially Hagen. The Klage also repeatedly notes the possibilities that could have prevented the catastrophe that ends the Nibelungenlied. The poem also embeds the catastrophe within a larger genealogical context with the Netherlandish and Burgundian royal genealogies, which relativizes it as part of a longer history and is able to show continuity of rule for the kings except Etzel. The Klage even seems to make the events of the Nibelungenlied seem as though they had not just occurred in the narrative time of the poem, but rather in a distant historical past. The dead heroes appear almost to be giants, a common trait of German heroic poetry when the heroes are imagined to have lived in a distant past. In contrast to the mostly positive portrayal of Etzel in the Nibelungenlied, the Klage reports that Etzel abandoned his Christianity, criticizes his exaggerated grief, and denies knowing what happened to the great king in the end. This could have been influenced by the negative traditions about Etzel (i.e. Attila the Hun) that circulated in chronicles. This corresponds to a general tendency of the poem to accentuate the differences between Christians and pagans more than its predecessor, as well as the placement of the poem into a clerical literary context in which the lack of \\"sources\\" about Etzel's fate makes a difference. The role of Dietrich von Bern The main character of the Klage is the hero Dietrich von Bern, who had been introduced in the Nibelungenlied as an exile living at Etzel's court. Dietrich organizes the manner in which the characters of the Klage overcome the catastrophe of the last poem, seeing to it that the dead are buried and that survivors are informed. In contrast to the previous poem, Dietrich appears in complete control of the situation, with unfavorable elements like his hesitancy to enter combat and his tendency to lament in an exaggerated fashion reinterpreted as positive traits. The Klage contains several allusions to stories about Dietrich that can only have existed as an oral tradition at the time, such as his involuntary exile from Italy, Dietrich's close relationship with Etzel's first wife Helche, and R√ºdiger's role in reconciling Dietrich with Helche, most likely after the death of Helche's sons while under Dietrich's care as reported in the later poem Rabenschlacht. Dietrich's return from exile only with Hildebrand, Herrat, and a mule closely resembles the account found in the Old Norse Thidreksaga, either because the compiler of the Thidrekssaga was aware of the Nibelungenklage or because both incorporate a similar orally transmitted story about Dietrich's return.

Although the academic discipline of transatlantic studies is a critical framework originating the 2000s, it has been argued that transatlanticism itself is in itself a very old phenomenon, and that transatlanticism shows the tension in nineteenth-century America between emphasizing the British dimensions of American culture and asserting the independence of American culture.Julia Straub Handbook of Transatlantic North American Studies 2016 3110376733 p59 \\"Yet Paul Giles contends, ‚ÄúTransatlanticism [...] is in itself a very old phenomenon,‚Äù highlighting the tension in nineteenth-century America between ‚Äúemphasiz[ing] British dimensions of American culture‚Äù and asserting an independent American one (2013, 15).

This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as Nationally Vulnerable by the Department of Conservation. Taxonomy This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1905 using a specimen collected by J. H. Lewis in Ida Valley, Otago. Meyrick named the species Crambus sophistes. In 1928 George Vernon Hudson also described and illustrated Crambus sophistes. In 1975 David E. Gaskin wrongly synonymised this species with Orocrambus cyclopicus. However its transfer into the genus Orocrambus has been accepted. The type specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Meyrick described the male of the species as follows: The female of the species is flightless. Although this species resembles other endemic species in its genus, it can be distinguished by labial palps. It can be distinguished from O. cyclopicus as it is larger in size and its female is short winged. Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. The range of this species is the Mackenzie Basin, Central Otago and Otago Lakes. O. sophistes is possibly extinct in its type locality. This species has been collected at Devils Elbow at Coronet Peak. Life cycle and behaviour Adults have been observed from mid-January to April. The male of the species is attracted to light. Habitat O. sophistes is a dryland specialist and occurs in short tussock grasslands where its host plant is a common component. Host species O. sophistes is associated with the endemic grass Festuca novae-zealandiae. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Vulnerable. The reduction in the range of this species aligns with the contraction of range of its endemic host along with the fact that, as a result of the flightlessness of the female, this species has a limited ability to disburse.

An Independent, she was the first female Chancellor of Austria. Bierlein served as the advocate general of the Procurator's Office ‚Äì essentially the country's chief public prosecutor ‚Äì from 1990 to 2002, as well as a member of the executive board of the International Association of Prosecutors from 2001 to 2003. In 2003, Bierlein was made a member of the Constitutional Court. Between January 2018 and June 2019, she served as President of the Constitutional Court, the first woman to hold the position. Following the Ibiza affair, President Alexander Van der Bellen named Bierlein Chancellor of Austria, after a parliamentary motion of no confidence dismissed the first government of Sebastian Kurz, the first successful motion of no confidence in Austrian modern history. She was the first woman to assume the role and served until the next government led by Kurz was sworn in following the legislative election which took place on 29 September 2019.  Early life  Brigitte Bierlein was born on 25 June 1949 in Vienna during the Allied occupation of Austria. Her father was a civil servant. Her mother, trained as an artist, was a homemaker. She was educated at the Gymnasium Kundmanngasse, from which she graduated in 1967. Bierlein originally wanted to study either art or architecture and came close to joining the University of Applied Arts. However, she ultimately chose to study law instead, partly on the advice of her mother and partly because she did not want to be a financial burden on her parents any longer than necessary. Bierlein enrolled at the University of Vienna, receiving her doctorate of law in 1971.  Judicial career  Bierlein served for four years as a candidate judge, before she was officially elevated to the judiciary in 1975. She spent the next two years presiding over trial courts, first the District Court Innere Stadt () and then the District Tribunal Vienna (), a criminal court that has since been dissolved. In the former position, she mostly dealt with cases at tenancy law, an area that appears to have bored her greatly. In 1977, Bierlein left the bench to join the Vienna Public Prosecutor's Office (). She was responsible for general and political criminal cases as well as for criminal cases pursuant to media law, a type of proceedings customarily handled by dedicated specialists in Austria. In 1986, Bierlein was promoted to the Vienna Chief Public Prosecutor's Office (). She was now a distinguished civil servant attached to one of the country's five most senior criminal chambers. In 1987, she spent a few months working in the Department of Criminal Law in the Ministry of Justice, then returned to her position in the prosecution service. In 1990, she was appointed advocate general of the Procurator's Office, the section of the prosecution service attached directly to the Supreme Court. She was the first woman to serve in this position. The same year, Bierlein became a member of the board of examiners for judges and prosecutors at the Vienna Higher Regional Court, a position she would hold until 2010. In 1995, Bierlein was appointed to the executive board of the Association of Austrian Prosecutors. From 2001 to 2003, she served as the association's president. Also from 2001 to 2003, she held a seat on the executive board of the International Association of Prosecutors. In 2002, the first Sch√ºssel government recommended Bierlein for appointment as vice president of the Constitutional Court. The move was not uncontroversial at the time. Bierlein had prosecuted crime with great fervor but had not distinguished herself as a legal scholar; she is in fact considered indifferent as a theorist to this day. Opposition politicians such as Josef Cap accused the government of passing over multiple more competent candidates in favor of a partisan hack. Bierlein supporters such as Maria Fekter countered that Bierlein's appointment would be an important step towards gender equality in Austria. According to the well-known Austrian law professor , Bierlein owed her career at the Constitutional Court to the Austrian politician J√∂rg Haider and her life partner, the Austrian judge Ernest Maurer, a close friend of J√∂rg Haider. and In 2007, the SP√ñ speaker for constitutional affairs, Hannes Jarolim severely criticized Ernest Maurer's close political relationship with J√∂rg Haider Assenting to the cabinet's recommendation, President Thomas Klestil appointed Bierlein on 21 November 2002, the appointment to be effective 1 January 2003. Once again, Bierlein was the first woman to serve in the role she was being elevated to. In fact, there had been no women at all on the Constitutional Court until 1995. Bierlein took over from the president of the court, Gerhart Holzinger, when he retired from the bench effective 31 December 2017. On the initiative of the Freedom Party, the right-of-center first Kurz government moved to turn her interim position into a permanent one. President Alexander Van der Bellen confirmed Bierlein as the new president of the Constitutional Court on 23 February 2018. Bierlein's previous role as vice president passed on to Supreme Court justice Christoph Grabenwarter. Wolfgang Brandstetter, who had formerly been vice chancellor and minister of justice on a People's Party ticket, was appointed to fill the vacancy of the Court. Bierlein reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 2019.  Politics  Bierlein has no political affiliation. She is seen as solidly right of centre. During her time as a prosecutor, she was noted for her hardline tough-on-crime stance, although her years on the bench have earned her a reputation for civility and for working well with ideological opponents. Commentators from both sides of the political spectrum note Bierlein's close ties to both People's Party and Freedom Party, as well as the fact that her career owes both its unexpected major breaks to right-of-centre coalition governments. Bierlein herself acknowledges both her toughness as a prosecutor and her socially conservative bent in general. In response to doubts about her ability to remain above the fray as a Constitutional Court justice, she claims to be as committed to impartiality as any other professional judge and also points out that she has never actually joined any party. In December 2017 the Austrian Constitutional Court with Bierlein as president ruled to introduce same-sex marriage on 1 January 2019. After the first Kurz government lost a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on 27 May 2019 following the Ibiza affair, Alexander Van der Bellen, the president of Austria, named Bierlein as Kurz's successor. She became the first female chancellor of Austria and was in office until the next government was formed following the National Council elections on 29 September 2019. Bierlein's appointment was agreed with all political parties in the National Council. She became the second independent to serve as a chancellor after Johannes Schober, who was in office twice between 1921 and 1930, and the first in Austria's post-war history.  Personal life  Bierlein is unmarried and has no children. Her partner is Ernest Maurer, a retired judge. Bierlein is a supporter of the arts. She owns contemporary paintings, although she does not consider herself a collector. She also attends theatre and opera performances as well as museums. She enjoys skiing and sailing. In June of 2020, Bierlein was pulled over on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. She was forced to surrender her drivers license for four weeks and has since issued an apology.https://www.meinbezirk.at/c-lokales/ex-kanzlerin-bierlein-wurde- fuehrerschein-abgenommen_a4110987  Honours  ; Austrian honours : 60x60px Grand Decoration of Honor in Silver with Sash of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria  References   External links  * Brigitte BIERLEIN at the Constitutional Court homepage Category:1949 births Category:20th-century Austrian women Category:21st-century Austrian women Category:21st-century Chancellors of Austria Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Austrian jurists Category:Austrian prosecutors Category:Austrian women judges Category:Constitutional court women judges Category:Female heads of government Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Vienna Category:Presidents of the Constitutional Court of Austria Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:Vice presidents of the Constitutional Court of Austria ","title":"Brigitte Bierlein"},{"id":"57351985","text":"Pagasa may refer to: *Pagasa (genus), an insect genus in the family Nabidae *PAGASA, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration *\\"May Pagasa\\", a pen-name of Jos√© Rizal *Pagasa, alternate spelling of Pagasae, a city of ancient Thessaly See also * Pag-asa (disambiguation) ","title":"Pagasa"},{"id":"57351987","text":"The Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) was an initiative launched at the May 1998 London Summit which was designed to give new impetus to EU-US co- operation in the field of trade and investment within the framework of the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA).Lee McGowan, David Phinnemore - A Dictionary of the European Union - 2015 Page 493 1317445163 \\"As a consequence of this, in May 1998 a Transatlantic Economic Partnership was initiated.

This is a widely-used method for classifying streams and rivers based on common patterns of channel morphology.EPA, 2018. ‚ÄúFundamentals of Rosgen Stream Classification System  Watershed Academy Web  US EPA.‚Äù n.d. Accessed May 6, 2018. https://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/moduleFrame.cfm?parent_object_id=1189. The specific objectives of this stream classification system are as follows: 1) predict a rivers behavior from its appearance; 2) develop specific hydrologic and sediment relationships for a given stream type and its state; 3) provide mechanisms to extrapolate site-specific data to stream reaches having similar characteristics; and 4) provide a consistent frame of reference for communicating stream morphology and condition among a variety of disciplines and interested parties. These objectives are met through Rosgen's four hierarchical levels (I-IV) of river morphology.  Hierarchy of the Rosgen Stream Classification  = Level I: Geomorphic Characterization = Level I categorize stream types into letters A - G based on their geomorphic characteristics that result from the integration of basin relief, land form, and valley morphology.Rosgen, David L. and H.L. Silvey 1996. ‚ÄúApplied River Morphology‚Äù Second Edition. Wildland Hydrology. Pagosa Springs, CO. This is a general way in which the morphology of a stream can be described. Many of the Level I criteria can be determined through topographic and landform maps, aerial imagery, and geospatial data.  Level II: Morphological Description  Level II characterizes stream type by using numbers 1 - 6, in addition to letters A - G, to include the assessments of the channel cross-section, longitudinal profile, and plan-form pattern. Cross-section measurements include a streams entrenchment ratio, width/depth ratio, and dominant substrate. The longitudinal and plan-form measurements consist of slope, stream bed features, sinuosity, and meander width ratio. Level II is a quantitative morphological assessment of the stream reach which provides greater detail from data collected in the field for the implementation into land management decisions.  Level III: Assessment of Stream Condition and Departure from its Potential  Level III describes the existing condition of a stream as it relates to its stability, response potential, and function. This level includes additional measurements such as, sediment supply, channel stability, and flow regime which further describe the condition or ‚Äústate‚Äù of the stream.  Level IV: Field Data Verification  Level IV verifies the process relationships inferred from the previous three levels of classification. The objective of this level is to determine empirical relationships for use in prediction (e.g. to develop Manning‚Äôs n values from measured velocity) = Applications = The Rosgen Stream Classification is probably best applied as a communication tool to describe channel form.Simon A., Doyle M., Kondolf M., Shields F.D., Rhoads B., and McPhillips M. 2007. ‚ÄúCritical Evaluation of How the Rosgen Classification and Associated ‚ÄòNatural Channel Design‚Äô Methods Fail to Integrate and Quantify Fluvial Processes and Channel Response1.‚Äù JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association 43 (5): 1117‚Äì31. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00091.x. Other uses for the Rosgen Stream Classification include fish habitat indices, surveys of riparian communities, stream restoration and mitigation, engineering, evaluating livestock grazing related to stream type, and the utilization of sediment and hydraulic data by stream type. = Limitations = Problems with the use of the Rosgen Stream Classification are encountered with identifying bankfull dimensions, particularly in incising channels and with the mixing of bed and bank sediment into a single population. Its use for engineering design and restoration may be flawed by ignoring some processes governed by force and resistance, and the imbalance between sediment supply and transporting power in unstable systems Limitations for Level II classification involve time dependence, uncertain applicability across physical environments, difficulty in identification of a true equilibrium condition, and uncertain process significance of classification criteria.Juracek Kyle E., and Fitzpatrick Faith A. 2007. ‚ÄúLimitations and Implications of Stream Classification.‚Äù JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association 39 (3): 659‚Äì70. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb03683.x. Implications of using the Rosgen Stream Classification, include: (1) acceptance of the limitations, (2) acceptance of the risk of classifying streams incorrectly, and (3) classification results may be used inappropriately  References  Category:Earth sciences Category:Geographic classifications Category:Geomorphology Category:Geology Category:Geological processes Category:Physical geography Category:Planetary science Category:Topography Category:Watercourses ","title":"Rosgen Stream Classification"},{"id":"57352338","text":"The 1967 Boston College Eagles football team represented Boston College during the 1967 NCAA University Division football season.

In 1809 she sailed to England. She was sold to the Danes, but by 1811 was under English ownership under the name Moffat (or Moffatt). She then made seven voyages as a \\"regular ship\\" for the British East India Company (EIC). After the EIC exited its maritime activities in 1833‚Äì34, Moffat made four voyages transporting convicts to Australia: one voyage to Port Jackson and three to Van Diemen's Land. She also made at least one voyage carrying immigrants to South Australia, and later regularly traded between Liverpool and Bombay. She was last listed in 1856. Boyne Captain John Nicholls (or Nichol) sailed from Calcutta on 17 April 1809, bound for England. Boyne was at Saugor on 14 July and Madras on 21 September. She reached the Cape of Good Hope 25 December and St Helena on 27 January 1810; she arrived at Gravesend on 17 April. In England Boyne reportedly was sold to the Danes.This is curious as Denmark-Norway and England were engaged in the Gunboat War. However, she returned to English ownership c.1811. Moffat New owners named her Moffat. The EIC took her up as a \\"regular ship\\". =EIC voyages= EIC voyage #1 (1811‚Äì1812): Moffat first appears in Lloyd's Register for 1811 with B. Barber, master, J. Timbrell, owner, and as having left London on 20 March 1811 with destination India.\\"Season 1810 ‚Äì 1811\\". Captain Benjamin Barber acquired a letter of marque on 3 April 1811. Captain Barber sailed from Torbay 30 May 1811, bound for Bombay. Moffat reached Madeira on 20 June and arrived at Bombay on 26 October. Homeward bound, she reached St Helena on 14 February 1812 and Portsmouth on 25 April; she arrived at The Downs on 10 May. Moffat was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 16 July 1812.= EIC voyage #2 (1813‚Äì1814): Captain Simon Lee sailed from Portsmouth on 20 April 1813, bound for Madras and Bombay.

EIC voyage #4 (1824‚Äì1825): Captain Robert Railston Brown sailed from the Downs on 7 August 1824, bound for China and Quebec. Moffat spent much of the entire voyage in company with . Moffat arrived at Whampoa on 23 January 1825, and Juliana arrived two days later.British Library: Juliana. Moffat crossed the Second Bar on 23 February. Juliana and Moffatt left Canton on 24 February 1825. They kept company for 20 days but then separated off Java. They rejoined at the Cape of Good Hope. Juliana reached St Helena on 16 May, and Moffat did so on 17 May. They separated again, but arrived at Quebec within hours of other. Moffat arrived on 12 July, and Juliana arrived on 13 July. When they arrived, local newspapers reported that they were the first ships to come to Quebec from China.Ships List: Ship Arrivals at the Port of Quebec, 1825. Moffat arrived back at London on 30 September. EIC voyage #5 (1826‚Äì1827): Captain Brown sailed from The Downs on 25 June 1826, bound for China. Moffat arrived at Whampoa on 18 November. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 10 January 1827, reached St Helena on 18 March, and arrived at Blackwall on 16 May.

Moffat embarked 399 male convicts and suffered three convict deaths en route. One prisoner was found to be insane and was relanded before she left. She also carried 18 blacks from the West Indies, two of whom were among the three men who died on the voyage. In October she sailed to Bengal, transferring the last detachment of the 17th Regiment of Foot to Bengal. Convict voyage #3 (1837‚Äì1838): Captain Bolton sailed from Portsmouth on 9 November 1837.

He was a member of the New York City Council from the New York City borough of Queens from 1964 to 1977 and the leader of the Queens Democratic Party from 1971 to 1974. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in 1976 and was convicted of grand larceny in 1979. Early life Troy was born September 23, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, to Matthew Troy, a lawyer and political figure who served as a municipal judge. He graduated from Georgetown University and received his law degree from Fordham University School of Law.  Political career  In January 1964, the New York City Council elected Troy as an interim 5th district councilman to replace Seymour Boyers, who had been elected as the at-large council member for Queens. As this was an interim appointment, he would have to run in the 1964 general election to secure the seat for the remainder of Boyers‚Äô term. Troy actively opposed forced busing, a hot-button issue in eastern Queens, where an anti- integration organization, Parents and Taxpayers, had a strong following. In the general election, he defeated Republican Robert McMillan. In 1970, Troy briefly ran for the Democratic nomination for Attorney General of New York. He withdrew from the race in favor of Adam Walinsky. He later became the Democratic Party leader in Queens in 1971, succeeding Frank Smith. As a councilman and party leader, Troy clashed with Mayors John Lindsay and Abraham Beame throughout his career. He was a critic of Lindsay‚Äôs policies, especially with regard to a planned low-income housing development in Forest Hills. Troy also was an early backer of Senator George McGovern in the race for the 1972 Democratic nomination over Mayor Lindsay. In the 1973 election for Mayor, Troy supported the conservative Democrat Representative Mario Biaggi in the Democratic primary. His support for Biaggi came after making an initial promise of an endorsement to Beame. After Beame's victory, Troy began to clash with the new mayor over his austere budgets. In 1974, Beame worked with Donald Manes, the Borough President Of Queens, and a friend of Troy, to arrange Troy‚Äôs ouster as Democratic leader. Troy had angered Manes when he switched support to Howard J. Samuels in the 1974 race for Governor of New York. Convictions In 1976, Troy faced federal income tax charges that he had failed to report income on funds that he stolen from his clients‚Äô estates. Troy pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false tax return and served 55 days in prison. Although he pleaded guilty to a felony, under state law, the crime was a misdemeanor which allowed him to hold on to his council seat. He was disbarred after the plea. He ran for re-election in 1977 but lost the Democratic nomination to Sheldon Leffler in the wake of his conviction. Leffler, coincidentally, was eventually convicted of campaign fraud in 2013. The State Of New York indicted him on larceny and perjury charges as a result of the federal investigation in 1977. A judge dismissed the perjury charge but let the remaining larceny charges go to trial. At his trial, Troy stated that he took the money because he overdrew his checking account. A judge turned aside his argument that the charges constituted double jeopardy and that his agreement with federal prosecutors to face no further charges did not permit the conviction. In 1979, Troy consented to a guilty verdict and was sentenced to 26 weekends in prison. Later life and death Troy was the executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association but did not enter politics again. He practiced law after the restoration of his law license for the remainder of his life. He died on December 4, 2004, from Parkinson's disease.

From around 1896 to 1904, he was a book smuggler helping distribute the banned Lithuanian books. A son of poor peasants, he never received any formal education. He learned to read at home and with financial support from ≈Ωiburƒólis studied privately in 1907‚Äì1910. In 1901, he met with Povilas Vi≈°inskis who taught him the basics of poetry. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas wrote most of his works in 1904‚Äì1910. Eight different poetry collections were published before World War I. His poetry built on the traditions of the Lithuanian folk songs. Two of his best known poems were adapted into folk songs. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, his works reflected struggles and suffering of the common people and socialist ideology. His later poems repeated socialist‚Äìcommunist slogans. Biography Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas was born in the village of near ≈†iauliai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of poor Lithuanian farmers. The family owned three dessiatins ‚Äì about ‚Äì of land and raised four children. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas did not attend school, but was educated at home. He showed great interest in books and even began teaching other children to read. He contracted trachoma, an infectious eye disease, and later lost eyesight in one of his eyes. He worked as a herder and began experimenting with short stories and songs based on the Lithuanian folk traditions. In 1897, he sent his first song to Tƒóvynƒós sargas. While it was not published, he received a letter from its editor Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas encouraging him to continue writing. From around 1896 to 1904, Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas was a book smuggler helping distribute the banned Lithuanian books in Pakruojis, Rozalimas, Lygumai, Pa≈°vitinys, Linkuva, ≈Ωeimelis, and elsewhere. In 1899, while carrying the books, he was shot in the back by a Russian policeman. He had to borrow about 100 rubles for treatment, but recovered and continued book smuggling. His first submission to Tƒóvynƒós sargas, a correspondence, was printed in 1901. Via , Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas was introduced to the intelligentsia of ≈†iauliai area ‚Äì ≈Ωemaitƒó, Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó-Bitƒó, Sofija P≈°ibiliauskienƒó (Lazdyn≈≥ Pelƒóda), , Povilas Vi≈°inskis. Vi≈°inskis, mentor of literary talent, noticed Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas' interest in literature and taught him the basics, including rhyme, of poetry. He wrote his first poems in 1902 and they were well received. With Vi≈°inskis help, his poems were published in Varpas, ≈™kininkas, Naujienos as well as Lithuanian periodicals published in United States, including Vienybƒó lietuvnink≈≥. In total, his poetry was published in more than 25 Lithuanian periodicals. Since the publications were illegal, he signed by many different pen names, including Gaivalas (uncontrollable force of nature, tempest), Laukinis (wild), Sur≈´dijusi Plunksna (rusty feather), Vƒójobrolis (wind brother), but Jovaras (hawthorn) became most popular. As Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas explained, he chose this pen name, which later he used as part of his last name, because hawthorn is a hardy, small, not particularly attractive tree ‚Äì just like himself, a man of a village. Tomb of Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas (sculpture Poetic Muse by Aloyzas Toleikis, 1973) After the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904, Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas began selling various calendars, books, and periodicals legally in ≈†iauliai. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, he organized a makeshift printing press at his home and printed various anti-Tsarist proclamations for the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. In 1906, the first collection of his poetry was published in a separate 16-page booklet. It was edited by Vi≈°inskis and printed by the Zawadzki Press. In 1907‚Äì1910, Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas was an informal student. He first visited Lithuanian students in Saint Petersburg and then, receiving a monthly stipend from ≈Ωiburƒólis, privately studied in ≈†iauliai, assisted by the students of the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium. In 1908, he became acquainted with Julius Janonis, another young Lithuanian poet, and they used to discuss literary matters. In 1909 and 1912, Varpas Society organized two Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas' poetry evenings in ≈†iauliai. When the stipend ceased, he moved back to his native Kalni≈°kiai and lived off his farm. He had a large private collection of various Lithuanian books and periodicals and his home acted as a village library. Writer Juozas Gru≈°as credited Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas and this library for inspiring him. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas retired from the farm and moved to ≈†iauliai in 1945. As a member of the Union of Soviet Writers, he received a government pension. He reconstructed a war- damaged two-storey brick house. The first floor was taken by Dap≈°iai family, while he lived on the second floor. He was elected to the ≈†iauliai city council. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1949 and was declared People's Poet of the Lithuanian SSR in 1960. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas was married three times. He first married in 1911 and had two children, but divorced in 1922. His first wife and daughter emigrated to Argentina. He married again in 1925. His second wife Ona Rakauskaitƒó was twenty years his junior, but died of tuberculosis in 1947. They had four children. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas remarried again in 1950. After his widow's death in 1980, Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas' house in ≈†iauliai was converted into a memorial museum in 1986. Poetry Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas wrote most of his works in 1904‚Äì1910. His poetry often features complaints and lamentations about life's struggles and suffering and scenes of nature. His verse is simple, accessible to the common folk. The poems are similar to Lithuanian folk songs and two of them, Ko li≈´di, ber≈æeli? (Why so Sad, Birch Tree?) and Tylus, tylus vakarƒólis (Quiet Quiet Evening), were adapted into folk songs. During and after the Russian Revolution of 1905, his poetry reflected social democratic political ideas and slogans. In later years, he reworked his earlier poems or created new poems that repeated socialist‚Äìcommunist slogans. He was one of the first Lithuanian poets to write in free verse. He also wrote 23 sonnets. His poetry was influenced by folk traditions and by Maironis. In turn, he influenced Julius Janonis and Kazys Binkis. Eight separate collections of his poetry were published before World War I. ≈Ωibutƒó arba Pirmieji pavasario ≈æiedai (Liverleaf or the First Blooms of Spring), the first collection of Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas' poetry, was published in Vilnius in 1906. Three more collections followed in 1908. Isakas Brevda published Poezija (Poetry) and Jausm≈≥ kibirk≈°tƒólƒós (Sparks of Feelings) at the combined circulation of 25,000 copies in ≈†iauliai. They were the first Lithuanian-language publications in ≈†iauliai after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904. Otto von Mauderode in Tilsit published ≈†irdies balsai (Voices of the Heart). The Society of Saint Casimir published Jubiliejinƒó knygelƒó (Jubilee Book) in Kaunas in 1912. Another collection Sielos aidas. Eilƒós (Echo of the Soul. Poetry) was published in Vilnius in 1913 (circulation of 10,000 copies). Two poetry collections were published by Lithuanian Americans: Pirmieji ≈æiedai (First Blooms) in Chicago in 1909 and Am≈æinos dainos (Forever Songs) in Boston in 1914. During the interwar years, Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas published only one collection of poetry in 1923. It included only a few new poems. His poems were printed on greeting cards and in advertisements of confectionery. More collections were published in Soviet Lithuania: in 1947 (second corrected edition in 1952), 1955 (included post-war works), 1956 (included works by Butk≈≥ Juzƒó), 1961, 1980. In 1995, Bronius Prƒóskienis published a biography of Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas. In addition to poetry, he published a collection of short stories Tƒóvynƒós laukuose (In the Fields of the Homeland) in Pittsburgh in 1909. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas also collected and recorded folk tales, legends, riddles, proverbs, and other examples of folk culture. Riddles and proverbs collected by him were published in Au≈°rinƒó in 1911. He sent collected folk tales to Jonas Basanaviƒçius who published nine of them in 1928. Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas sent 16 texts to the Lithuanian Scientific Society in 1914.

In Ukrainian graphics there exist a number of symbols and images from national songs, legends. Such symbols and imagery are used in national customs and rituals. They are reproduced in embroidery on national costumes, ritual cloth‚Äîrushnyks, painted on crockery, in forged products, in carving, in bas-relief house decoration, in hearth painting, pottery, engraving and also in Ukrainian traditional Easter eggs‚Äîpysankas. Symbols are roughly divided into animalistic and floral symbols. Holy images (on wood, glass) were decorated by Ukrainian, Ruthenian masters, with stylized symmetrical flowers, inflorescences and \\"apples\\", located in the upper part of an icon.. Among the motifs of decor of Ukrainian icons were such stylized flowers as clove, tulip, rose, lotus, pomegranate, lily, acanthus and vine.

Clothes  = Embroidered shirt (Vyshyvanka) = embroidered shirt Vyshyvanka is an embroidered national women's and men's white shirt. Embroidered shirt is a symbol of health, beauty, happy destiny, generic memory, decency, honesty, love, festivity; amulet. The symbolism of embroidery depended on the person for whom it was made: a bridegroom, a husband, a young boy, a girl, a married woman. Vyshyvanka was made from handmade flax or hemp cloth. There existed many types of traditional shirts depending on the shape, materials, semantics of colors. They were named after Ukrainian ethnographical regions where they were produced, such as Podillia, Halychyna, Polissia, Volyn, Dnipro, Poltava, Hutsulshchyna, Bukovyna, Lemkivshchyna and others. The symbolism of embroidery often coincides with the symbols of objects ornaments of material Trypillia culture. = Wreath = Rushnyk Wreath is the symbol of life, destiny, life strength; symbol of virginity. Wreath is also a symbol of excellence. = Ukrainian embroidered cloth (Rushnyk) = The cloth band itself has a bright symbolic meaning of the way, destiny, protection. And when this band also has woven or embroidered signs-amulets its protective power grows. In all regions of Ukraine rushnyk was used to cover the bread on a table. When a son was heading long away from home, his mother gave him a rushnyk. In Ukraine guests are still greeted with salt and bread on rushnyk. In Ukrainian home, rushnyks are hung above the icons and the portraits of family members. Rushnyk is used in many customs, above all in those related to marriage and sending someone off to the other world.  Floristic symbols  Main floristic symbols include snowball tree, willow, oak, poplar, periwinkle, marigold.

Painted Easter egg (Pysanka)  Pysanka is a symbol of the sun; life, his immortality; love and beauty; spring renewal; the good, happiness, joy. Every ornamental motif has a certain sacral meaning. They all together shape the painted prayer about consent and peace between people. In the Christian culture of Ukrainians, pysanka has become a symbol of resurrection.

Holy images  In the adornment of hut holy images there can be traced certain affinity in decoration, weaving motifs, embroidery, ceramics, carving, wedding trunk painting, table paintings. This proves the mutual influence of different types of folk art. Holy image painting of Hutsulshchyna and Pokuttia regions have the following ornamental elements: Radomyshl icon * flower branches; * tulips, combined with \\"Silesia rose\\"; * lilies; * bells: * wild rose. Podillia region holy images outstand with decorations of * lush flowers scattered with beams, bouquets of wreaths; * palm and wreath; * plants that are similar to palm branches or bells; * branches-tassels; * element of \\"apple\\" ornament. The distinctive feature of holy images of Sivershchyna region have on their background different sized beads. Such an artistic technique gives the impression that the icon was dressed in a robe that resembles a delicate lace. The frame of such an icon is the flowers, painted in modernist style using a wavy line. Iconography of Podniprovia region (Cherkasy region, in particular Chyhyrynshchyna), partly in Kyiv Polissia is poorly ornamented. The entire decoration is limited to two large flowers placed at the top of the icon or scattered throughout the background with small flowers in the form of stylized crosses of yellow and white. Symbols of Cherkashchyna region are characterized by conventional floral ornaments such as bouquets, peonies, grape vine stems (grapes are isomorphic and stylized images, which emphasizes the compact grouping of rounded, dotted or even linear elements, resembling abundant grape clusters; grapevine–°–µ–ª—ñ–≤–∞—á–æ–≤ –ú. –†. –õ–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–Ω —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –æ—Ä–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–∫–∏ (—ñ–∫–æ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—ñ—è, –Ω–æ–º—ñ–Ω–∞—Ü—ñ—è, —Å—Ç–∏–ª—ñ—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞, —Ç–∏–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ—è). ‚Äî 2-–≥–µ –≤–∏–¥. / –ü–µ—Ä–µ–¥–º–æ–≤–∞: –∞–∫–∞–¥. –ú. –í. –ü–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—á–∞; –Ü–Ω-—Ç –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—Ç–≤–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞, —Ñ–æ–ª—å–∫–ª–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ —Ç–∞ –µ—Ç–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ—ó —ñ–º. –ú. –†–∏–ª—å—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—ó –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º—ñ—ó –Ω–∞—É–∫ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, –ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∏–π —ñ–Ω-—Ç –¥–µ–∫–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-–ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—Ç–≤–∞ —ñ –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω—É —ñ–º. –ú. –ë–æ–π—á—É–∫–∞, –ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π —É–Ω-—Ç –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∏ —ñ –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—Ç–≤, –ù–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–µ —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–≤–æ —ñ–º. –ú. –¢—Ä–æ—Ö–∏–º–µ–Ω–∫–∞ / –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ. ‚Äî –ö.: –†–µ–¥. –≤—ñ—Å–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ê–Ω—Ç, 2009. ‚Äî 408 —Å., —ñ–ª. is a symbol of the Eucharist, a symbol of Christ, His blood shed for the redemption of mankind from sins–û–≤—Å—ñ–π—á—É–∫ –í. –ê. –û–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥—å –ø—Ä–æ —ñ–∫–æ–Ω—É / –í. –û–≤—Å—ñ–π—á—É–∫, –î. –ö—Ä–≤–∞–≤–∏—á. ‚Äî –õ—å–≤—ñ–≤: –Ü–Ω-—Ç –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, 2000. ‚Äî 397 —Å.

The Yakima River Delta is an area of land in Richland, Washington where the Yakima River enters the Columbia River at River Mile 335. It hosts several protected areas and is crossed by State Route 240. This area is mostly floodplain with riparian-type growth, including non-native species such as Russian olive. Amon Creek enters the Yakima River in this area. The area is used extensively for recreational purposes, such as kayaking and hiking. The Sacagawea Heritage Trail, a bike path traveling through all three cities in the Tri-Cities, crosses the delta alongside State Route 240. The delta is generally bounded by Columbia Park Trail to the south and Interstate 182 to the north. A small portion of extends to the north of I-182 between Queensgate Drive and the Bypass Highway toward the site of the Duportail Bridge. The portion to the east of State Route 240 is dotted by numerous islands, and Bateman Island lies immediately to the east. Protected Areas Signage for the Yakima Delta Wildlife Management Unit.Most of the delta is located within protected areas. The entirety of the south side of the Yakima River, as well as a portion on the west side of the river to the north of I-182, are contained within the Yakima Delta Wildlife Management Unit which is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Unit encompasses approximately . The portion of the delta directly south of Columbia Point is also within the unit. To the north of the river west of State Route 240 is the Chamna Natural Preserve, which is owned by the city but jointly maintained by the Tapteal Greenway. The preserve is home to of hiking trails with interpretive signage to provide visitors with descriptions of the plants and wildlife that can be found within its boundaries. Chamna was the name of a nearby Native American village. Both sections are day-use areas where camping and hunting are prohibited. Ecology Despite being positioned within an arid climate, the delta provides habitat to a wide variety of plant and animal life. Numerous birds frequent the area, including more unusual species such as marbled godwit and red phalarope. Salmon are an important species that inhabit the waters, which are controlled by the McNary Dam near Umatilla, Oregon. The dense riparian forest adjacent to more desert plant life make it susceptible to wildfires, one of which occurred in 2011. Current threats to the ecology of the area include recreational overuse and invasive species. =Restoration= Several agencies have worked to restore the ecology of the river delta in recent years with other projects in their planning stages. Repeated efforts to control invasive species are conducted by the Benton County Conservation District and Noxious Weed Control Board. These efforts are to control common reeds, which tend to group together choking out native plants. Beyond this, they create a habitat for mosquitos, which then create a public health hazard. The Tapteal Greenway and City of Richland removed 16 tons of garbage from the Chamna Natural Preserve. The construction of the causeway connecting Bateman Island to the shore around 1940 dammed water that previously flowed between the island and the shore, causing temperatures to sharply increase in the water to the west of the island. This water temperature provides an ideal habitat for exotic species to feed on juvenile salmon in the spring. The causeway also blocks adult salmon heading upstream from entering the Yakima River as they had done before it was built. Restoring the natural flow on the south side of the island, along with other restoration projects throughout the Lower Yakima Basin could provide billions of dollars to the economy.

He received the Shaurya Chakra, the third highest peacetime military award from the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind at the Defence Investiture Ceremony‚ÄìI, at a ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi on March 27, 2018. Major Shukla was awarded the Sena Medal on January 26, 2018.  Early life and education  Shukla is an alumnus of St. Joseph Academy. He got into Indian Army by getting selected through NDA examination.  Military career  On April 30, 2018, Major Shukla killed the category A++ terrorist of Hizbul Mujahideen, Sameer Tiger in a joint operation by Jammu and Kashmir Police, Indian Army and Central Reserve Police Force. A day before his encounter, Tiger threatened Indian Army, specifically Major Shukla in a viral video. Shukla was injured with a bullet wound on his right hand during the encounter and was undergoing treatment as of May 2018. Major Rohit Shukla has commanded more than 52 operations carried out by the Indian Army against terrorists. Following the incident a rifleman, named Aurangzeb, who served with Shukla, was kidnapped, tortured, and killed, by terrorists. They subsequently released gruesome video from his torture, on Twitter. In Shukla's unit every soldier was paired with a partner, or buddy, with each member of the pair watching out for the other. Aurangzeb had been paired with Shukla on the mission where he killed Tiger, and this was the reason he was singled out for retaliation. According to the India Times their video specifically shows Aurangzeb being tortured into admitting he was Shukla's buddy. India Times speculated that the release of this video might trigger India's News Broadcasting Standards Authority to step in to try to control the rebroadcasting of video and audio from opposition elements. The Army had explicitly called on news agencies to refrain from rebroadcasting the video of Shukla's partner's torture and killing, and several agencies rebroadcast it anyhow. The Army conducted an inquiry, after the video was released, as the identity of the buddies is classified, and the video suggested there had been a breach of security. On February 6, 2019, Mehbooba Mufti, a former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, criticized Shukla over his treatment of a civilian captive. She told reporters she had recently visited a youth, in hospital, following interrogation by Shukla.

Woking was one of the boroughs subject to a trial of voter ID restrictions requiring the production of photographic ID or 2 other forms of ID. Results The Conservatives lost one seat to the Liberal Democrats, with Mount Hermon councillor Mark Pengelly losing to Liam Lyons, who had been defeated by Pengelly two years earlier. The Conservatives also failed to win their target seats of Byfleet and St John's, and came within 10 votes of losing in Goldsworth Park, although they held seats in Horsell, Knaphill, Heathlands and Pyrford with large majorities. The result meant that the Tory majority on the council reduced from two to one, although the Conservatives still maintained control as they have done since 2007, counting a short period of minority administration.
