Blumental studied literature at the University of Warsaw, where he received a master's degree with a thesis called ‚ÄúOn Metaphor.‚Äù He is reputed to have known nearly a dozen languages, including Hebrew, Yiddish, French, Polish, and Ukrainian. After graduating college he worked as a teacher in Lublin. His essays and literary criticism appeared before the Second World War in Warsaw in Yiddish newspapers and magazines such as Literarishe bleter, Vokhnblat, Arbeter-tsaytung, Foroys, in Lublin Tugblat and in Lodz Dos naye lebn. He translated an abridged version of the novel The Peasants (Ch≈Çopi) by Nobel laureate W≈Çadys≈Çaw Stanis≈Çaw Reymont into Yiddish. During the German occupation of Poland, Blumental was able to escape to the Soviet Union and survived the Holocaust. His first wife Maria and son Ariel, who had stayed in Poland, tried to pass as Catholics but were betrayed to the Nazis and murdered in 1943.\\"The Holocaust Survivor Who Deciphered Nazi Doublespeak.\\" The New York Times 24 June 2019. Retrieved 29 June 2019. In 1944 Blumental returned to Poland, where he, along with an assortment of historians, ethnographers and linguists, established the Central Jewish Historical Commission. They transcribed 3,000 survivor testimonies between 1944 and 1947, scavenged for Nazi paperwork in abandoned Gestapo offices and meticulously preserved documentary fragments of day-to-day ghetto life. The Central Jewish Historical Commission was reorganized into the Jewish Historical Institute in 1947, and Blumental became its first director. In the late 1940s, Blumental also attended three war-crime tribunals as an expert witness, including the trial of Rudolf H√∂ss, the Auschwitz camp commandant. Blumental is notable for the documentation and description of the systemic doublespeak and euphemisms that the Nazis employed to obscure the mechanics of mass murder, such as \\"evacuation\\" and \\"exit\\" for operations that typically resulted in death of the \\"evacuated.\\" He envisioned the compilation of a dictionary of Nazi words that would reverse-engineer the language and reveal the real meaning behind the many euphemisms. In 1947, he published Slowa niewinne (Innocent Words), covering letters A through I, the first of what he envisioned to be two volumes of his dictionary. Coincidentally, that same year, another survivor philologist, Viktor Klemperer, published Language of the Third Reich, a similar enterprise dissecting Nazi usage. Blumental never completed his second volume, but his papers show how the project metastasized over time, especially as he gained access to fresh source material from newly opened Nazi archives. In 1950, Nachman Blumental immigrated to Israel, where he remarried and devoted the rest of his life to Holocaust research. In February 2019, his son Miron Blumental donated 30 boxes of his father's personal papers, composed of over 200,000 documents, to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York. According to YIVO's director, Jonathan Brent, it is ‚Äúone of the last great remaining archives of the Holocaust.‚Äù\\"YIVO receives the archive of Nachman Blumental.\\" YIVO Institute for Jewish Research 25 June 2019.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. The area includes four mountains, a native trout stream and the headwaters of seven major streams, as well as the watershed for the Gatewood Reservoir that provides water for the town of Pulaski. The area is part of the Walker Mountain Cluster. Location and access Main Street, PulaskiThe area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, just north of Interstate 81 and about 3 miles west of Pulaski, Virginia. In 2011, trails into the area included: *Tract Fork Trail, 3.9 miles, easy to moderate in difficulty. **Directions to trailhead: ***The western trailhead can be reached from exit 47 on I-77. Go east on Va 717 for 2 miles to the junction with SR 601 and SR 603. Then go east on VA 601 for 10.1 miles, turn right (south) onto SR 600(one-lane, gravel), and go 2.5 miles to reach the western trailhead on the left at the crest of Little Walker Mountain. ***To reach the eastern trailhead, leave I-81 at exit 94 and go north on VA99 passing through Pulaski where the road becomes SR 738 (Robinson Tract Rd. Continue 4 miles and turn left onto SR 641 (Cox Hollow Rd) and go 3.8 miles to the trailhead. The last part of the route is also called Forest Road 682. **Description: From the eastern trailhead, follow upstream along an old wagon road through a forest of white pines, hemlocks, rhododendrons, hardwoods and wildflowers. At one mile there is a junction with the Polecat Trail on the left. The trail crosses into Wythe county at 1.3 miles, ascends a ridge saddle at 2.5 miles where there is a grass area for a good campsite. Pioneers used the old wagon road that leaves the trail. The trail continues to ascend the southern slope of Little Walker Mountain, passing an old road on the left at 3.6 miles and reaches SR 600, the western trailhead, at 4.0 miles. *Polecat Trail, 1.45 miles, easy to moderate in difficulty. **Directions to trailhead: The trailhead can be reached from the south by starting at the I-81/I-77 intersection at Fort Chiswell. Go 3 mile on VA 121 and SR 620 passing through Max Meadows to the junction with SR 712. Turning onto SR 712, go 6 miles, turn onto SR 707 on left and continue for 1.8 miles to the trailhead on the right. Parking is on the left. **Description: Following an old railroad grade, the trail crosses a tributary of Peak Creek at 0.6 mile, recrosses the tributary at 0.8 miles to reach a good campsite in a forest of hardwoods and rhododendrons. The trail then climbs a ridge at 1 mile, descends to cross a tributary of Tract Fork to reach the Tract Fork Trail at 1.4 miles. The eastern trailhead for the Tract Fork Trail is 1 mile on the right, and the western trailhead is 3 miles to the left. Boundary of the Little Walker Mountain wildland as identified by the Wilderness Society The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley, Trails Illustrated Hiking Maps, 787). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Little Walker Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Pulaski and Long Spur. Natural history The area is part of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. There are a few stands of table mountain pine, a tree that has become uncommon because it requires fire to reproduce. A very rare plant, the sword- leaved phlox, is found in the area. Topography The wildland is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section. Ridges, composed of sandstone and shale, run northeast/southwest, with parallel valleys created from limestone or shale. The area includes four mountains, Little Walker, Tract, Piney, and Chestnut, and the headwaters of many streams including Little Walker Creek, Panther Lick Hollow, Laurel Hollow, Tract Fork, Pondlick Branch, Eddys Branch and Peak Creek. The Gatewood reservoir, bordering the area on the south, serves as a water supply for the Town of Pulaski. Tributaries of Peak Creek are part of the watershed for the reservoir. The lowest elevation of 2080 feet is found near Little Walker Creek, and the high elevation of 3120 feet is found at a point on the crest of Little Walker Mountain. Streams in Virginia are recognized for their water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest. Tract Fork is rated a class iii streams. There are many stands of old growth trees, possibly as many as 81 acres. Prescribed fires on the lower parts of Piney Mountain are conducted to encourage the natural reproduction of table mountain pine. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Little Walker Mountain was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. American Electric Power has a transmission line outside the area on the southwest. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. A large part of the area is designated ‚ÄúRemote Backcountry-Non-motorized‚Äù and ‚ÄúSource Water Protection‚Äù. A section on the northeast is designated ‚ÄúRuffed Grouse Habitat‚Äù and there are areas designated ‚ÄúMix of Successional Habitats‚Äù and ‚ÄúOld Growth with Disturbance‚Äù on small parts of the eastern end. Cultural history A survey for cultural resources in a 799-acre parcel of the area found a prehistoric hunting- transient camp. The area is considered of some potential for additional prehistoric and historic sites. Two old homesites south of Forest Road 692 have become overgrown and will eventually decay away.

This building's unique history earned it a declaration as a national heritage monument in 1999.  Present  When the property developer Urban Ocean purchased the once prominent building on 77 Commissioner Street, on the corner with Simmonds Street, in 2003, it was in a state of disrepair. Currently, it houses a hotel, offices, apartments, restaurants, a spa, and a gymnasium.  History  The first building on the site dated to 1886 and was made of corrugated iron and wood. It was known as \\"Beit's house\\" In 1893, a two-story edifice was built with luxury finishes such as balconies, cast iron bars, and a copper and green-tiled cupola. The Jameson Raid was said to have been planned here. Hermann Eckstein, Jr., hired the South African architectural firm Leck & Emley to build Johannesburg's first skycraper of 10 stories. Upon the buildings completion in 1903 it was the largest and tallest commercial building in South Africa. It had an elevator and marble floors, and the offices were built with oak and African teak wood. In the basement were two large safes for the gold bars. Bullet holes in the front gable date to the 1922 Rand Rebellion. Rand Mines sold the building to Barclays Bank in 1964. The mining company then built a new headquarters nearby on the corner of Commissioner and Sauer Streets. At first, the new building was also known as Corner House.  Name  The name Corner House comes not only from the location of the building but also from the founder of Rand Mines, namely Hermann Eckstein. Eckstein means \\"cornerstone\\" in German, reflecting the younger Eckstein's perception of himself as a cornerstone of the mining industry.

Early life Dewey was born on November 9, 1856 in Hanover, New Hampshire to Maj. Gen. Israel Dewey and Susan Augusta (Sweester) Dewey. He was a second cousin of Admiral George Dewey. He grew up near military posts in the western and southwestern parts of the United States. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College in 1878 and his Master of Arts degree from Dartmouth in 1879. While at Dartmouth he served as a paymaster's clerk in the United States Army. In 1879 the Army transferred Dewey to Boston. He resided at the Norfolk House in Roxbury, Boston with his mother, brother, and sister until 1903 when he moved to a new home in Back Bay. Dewey left the Army in 1880 and proceeded to read law in the office of Ambrose Ranney. In 1882 he earned his Bachelor of Laws degree from Boston University and was admitted to the bar. From June 11, 1880 to February 26, 1889 he was judge advocate general on the staff of the 1st Brigade of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. Politics On September 29, 1885, Dewey was elected to the Boston Common Council in a special election caused by the resignation of William M. Osborne. He was reelected in 1885, 1886, and 1887. From 1889 to 1891 he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Legal career In 1891, Dewey was made a member of the Suffolk County Board of Bar Examiners. In 1895 he was named chairman of the board. In 1897 he was appointed to a five-year term as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners. In 1896 he was appointed as a special justice for the Boston Municipal Court. In 1899 he was made an associate justice of the Boston Municipal Court. Dewey was known for being outspoken on the bench as well as sympathetic towards defendants. Police officers were known to not seek search warrants from him because Dewey would ask them after the search if they had found anything. Dewey was especially sympathetic towards people arrested for drunkenness, as he viewed alcoholism as more of an illness than a crime. In 1902, The Boston Daily Globe called Dewey \\"the best-known and most interesting man in [Boston]\\". On December 10, 1902, Dewey resigned from the bench to return to private practice. On January 4, 1900 he joined the military staff of Governor Winthrop M. Crane as Judge Advocate General. He was retained by Crane's successor, John L. Bates. In 1904, Democrat William Lewis Douglas defeated Bates and chose to remove all of Bates' staff, including Dewey. Run for mayor In 1905, Dewey ran for Mayor of Boston. He faced Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Louis A. Frothingham and state senator Edward B. Callender in a three way Republican primary. Frothingham was declared the winner over Dewey by 275 votes. After a recount, this number was reduced to 249. On November 21, Dewey announced that he would run as an independent. He finished third behind Democrat John F. Fitzgerald and Frothingham with 12.5% of the vote. Commitment In 1909, Dewey announced that he was running as a \\"theocratic candidate for governor\\". On October 3 he made a 12-hour speech on Boston Common regarding his political theories. Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William M. Olin found Dewey's nomination papers to not be in legal form and he was not placed on the ballot. In 1909, Dewey filed a $76 million libel suit against the executive committee of the Good Government Association (Laurence Minot, Eliot N. Jones, John Mason Little, George R. Nutter, and Nathaniel Thayer III) for statements made during his mayoral campaign. On June 9 the jury decided in favor of the defendants after only 35 minutes of deliberation. Following his legal defeat, Dewey tried to have writs of replevin issued against almost every criminal and superior court judge as well as Governor Eugene Foss, Lieutenant Governor Frothingham, Mayor Fitzgerald, Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Joseph H. Walker, Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Swift, State Treasurer Elmer A. Stevens, Secretary of the Commonwealth Albert P. Langtry, and Suffolk County District Attorney Joseph C. Pelletier. He also tried to have arrest warrants issued against a number of religious and public figures, including Foss, Swift, Langtry, Fitzgerald, Pelletier, Cardinal William Henry O'Connell, Bishops William Lawrence and Alexander Hamilton Vinton, Police Commissioner Stephen O'Meara, and attorney Henry F. Hurlburt. On February 9, 1912, Dewey was found to be mentally ill and was committed to Boston State Hospital by Judge Robert Grant. He remained there until his death on May 12, 1932.

Cell block and police quarters  Ticket of leave men (as convicts on assigned work duties were called) were frequently reported by their employers for various offences, particularly drunkenness, a common punishment for which was 7 to 14 days in the lock-up. So in 1852, a cell block and police quarters were constructed.Old Police Station, York, The National Trust of Australia (WA), 1984, p.9. These buildings appear on the left hand side of Captain Edmund Henderson‚Äôs drawing of York published in The Illustrated London News of 28 February, 1857. The lockup is basically as it exists today except for the entrance to the later large exercise yard, and the removal of some interior walls to make larger cells. The cell block was constructed by the 20th Company of Royal Sappers and Miners. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 20 August 1852, p.3.  Courthouse  In 1859, what is now called the No. 2 courthouse was added to the complex on the south side of the police station.Infra, p.17. This courthouse was doubled in size in 1874, the architect being Richard Roach Jewell.  Troopers‚Äô cottage and stables  In 1865, a troopers‚Äô cottage and stables were added on the river side of the cells, and an exercise yard for the cells.Infra, p.12.  New courthouse and police quarters  In 1895, the old police quarters were demolished a new courthouse and police quarters were constructed in front of the complex along Avon Terrace, at a cost of ¬£3,000. John Forrest laid the foundation stone on 24 October 1895, being presented with a \\"handsome silver trowel suitably inscribed\\" for the purpose. Forrest noted that the foundation stone \\"would serve to bring to the minds of future generations a date in the history of Western Australia when the colony had been passing through a period of great commercial and industrial activity as a result of the discovery and rapid expansion of the goldfields\\".Infra, p.12; Western Mail, 1 November 1895, p.6. On completion in 1896, these new buildings were regarded unfavourably by the town mainly because of their overly prominent and dominating position in the main street.AM Clack and J McColl, York Sketchbook The York Society, 2003. York residents also objected to the gaol remaining in the centre of the main street.York WA, York Visitor Centre, p.7. The police quarters ceased to be used in 1981, and the courthouse in 1983 when the complex was acquired by the National Trust of Australia (WA).National Trust of Australia website.  Architectural significance  The architect of the front buildings was George Temple-Poole and the building is in Federation Free Style, a commercial version of Federation Arts and Crafts style.R Apperley, R Irving and P Reynolds, A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p. 136. The York Post Office, constructed in 1893, and the Courthouse and police station ‚Äúform one of the finest building groups in the State with great vitality within harmonious unity‚Äù, according to heritage architect, Ian Molyneux.

Kincaid, 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 20 (1800), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing that where the recovery of specific real estate is sought, affidavits of value are permitted as a suitable mode of ascertaining the fact, and bringing it upon the record.. The principal question (whether an alien, British subject, was entitled under the treaty of peace to claim and hold lands in dower) was not discussed. Rather, the case concerned the mode of ascertaining the value of the matter in dispute. The case was decided on 13 February 1800 without oral argument.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/datesofdecisions.pdf Facts According to the record, \\"Marian Kincaid of Great Britain, widow, demanded against John G. Williamson the one-third of 300 acres of land, &c.;, in Chatham County as dower. That the tenant pleaded 1st, the Act of Georgia passed 1 March, 1778, attainting G. Kincaid (the demandant's late husband) forfeiting his estate, and vesting it in Georgia, without office; 2d, the Act of 4 May, 1782, banishing G. Kincaid and confiscating his estate; 3d, the appropriation and sale of the lands in question by virtue of the said attainder and confiscation before 3 September, 1783 (the date of the definitive treaty of peace) and before G. Kincaid's death; 4th, the alienage of the demandant (who was resident abroad on 4 July, 1776, and ever since) and therefore incapable of holding lands in Georgia. That the demandant replied that she and her husband were inhabitants of Georgia on the 19th of April 1775, then under the dominion of Great Britain; that her husband continued a subject of Great Britain and never owed allegiance to Georgia, nor was ever convicted by any lawful authority of any crimes against the state.\\". Dispute The court noted, \\"For the plaintiff in error, it was admitted in answer to an objection that the value of the matter in dispute did not appear upon the record, but it was urged that from the nature of the subject, the demand of the plaintiff could not ascertain it, nor from the nature of the suit (like a case of ejectment, where damages are only given for the ouster) could it be fixed by the finding of a jury, on the judgment of the court. 3 Bl.Com. 35-36. As therefore there was no act of Congress nor any rule of the court prescribing a mode to ascertain in such cases the value in dispute, that the party may have the benefit of a writ of error, it was proposed to continue the cause to afford an opportunity to satisfy the court by affidavits of the actual value of the property.\\" References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Ellsworth Court Category:1800 in United States case law ","title":"Williamson v.

It is the largest and oldest nature reserve in Ukraine. The reserve protects mountain-forest and meadow steppe plants and animals, with a high level of biodiversity. It is located just north of the town of Massandra. Topography The reserve lies on the main ridge of the Crimean Mountains along the southern edge of the Crimean Peninsula. The highest mountain in Crimea is in the reserve - Roman-Kosh at . The northern slopes of the mountains are long and gentle, the southern slopes drop steeply towards the sea. The higher ridges are frequently flat, grassy plateaus. The geology of the mountains is mixture of shales, sandstones, limestones and conglomerates, from different times in the Jurassic. The variety of rocks have eroded to form a diversity of soils at the lower elevations, supporting mountain-steppe and meadow-steppe. The headwaters of the Alma River are in the reserve. View from Roman-Kosh Mountain, in the Crimean Reserve Climate and ecoregion The climate of the Crimean Reserve is Humid continental climate - Hot summer sub- type (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a hot summer (at least one month averaging over ), and mild winters. In the reserve, the average temperature in February is , and in July. Precipitation ranges from 470 mm/year at the lower elevations to 1,000 mm/year on the peaks. The reserve is in the western extreme of the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion, a small band of territory that stretches from the southern Crimean peninsula to the northern Caucasus Mountains. Flora and fauna The reserve supports mountain-steppe and forest-steppe floral communities. Over 29,000 hectares are forested, with over half being oak. The oak forests are found at elevations of 600-900 meters above sea level. Beech forests cover 7,500 hectares, with some groves as much as 300 years old. Other common trees are pine, linden, hornbeam, and ash. Scientists in the reserve have recorded 1,357 species of vascular plants in 535 genera, an indication of high biodiversity. Common mammals are red deer, wild boar, European mouflon, and roe deer. Public use As a strict nature reserve, the Crimean Reserve's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is limited: mass recreation and construction of facilities is prohibited as are hunting and fishing. This is, however, an ecological excursion route (\\"Crimea Reserve\\") on which reserve staff provided guided tours on buses and automobiles; this route follows the Romanov Trail. These guided tours are limited by law to protect the natural settings of the reserve. Just outside of the reserve in the town of Alushta, the reserve sponsors a Museum of Nature, and a Dendrozoological Park.

Williams had a breakout year finishing with an ERA of 0.33, surrendering just 18 hits in 27 innings and 53 strikeouts. Devin struck out over half the batters he faced in 22 appearances. He received 12 of the 17 votes.  Pitching style  Williams has three primary pitches: 4-seam fastball, circle changeup with screwball-like movement while rotating the ball off the ring finger during release, which is also similar to a cricket leg-spinner bowling a googly, but at a much faster pace of around 85 mph and with a very high spin-rate of 2852 rpm. He also has a rarely-used cutter and sinker. In 2020, due to the increased movement on the changeup, he has increased its usage and is often used as a strikeout pitch. He refers to his changeup as the \\"Airbender,\\" a Nickname coined by Rob Friedman (baseball analyst).

Key findings of his research include: * How do unions affect firm profitability and economic performance? Together with Robert A. Connolly and Mark Hirschey, Hirsch finds that reduces firm profitability by sharing the returns to firm-specific intangible capital, and thus disincentives R&D; investment.Connolly, R.A., Hirsch, B.T., Hirschey, M. (1986). Union rent seeking, intangible capital, and market value of the firm. Review of Economics and Statistics, 68(4), pp. 567-577.Hirsch, B.T. (1991). Labor unions and the economic performance of firms. Kalamazoo, MI: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Specifically, Hirsch finds unionized U.S. firms in the 1970s to have, on average, 10-15% lower market value and earnings than non-unionized equivalents, which might contribute to the declining U.S. unionization in the 1980s.Hirsch, B.T. (1991). Union coverage and profitability among US firms. Review of Economics and Statistics, pp. 69-77. Overall, reviewing the evidence on union effects in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s, Hirsch concludes that unions effects have negatively affected the growth of U.S. firms, though without increasing their likelihood of business failure, and traces the breakdown of unions' role as workers collective voice in the U.S.Hirsch, B.T. (2004). What do unions do for economic performance? Journal of Labor Research, 25(3), pp. 415-455. * Another strand of Hirsch's research concerns wage differentials. For instance, Hirsch and Macpherson find that U.S. wage levels in predominantly female occupations were substantially lower throughout 1973-93, though they argue that only a third of the gender composition effect of occupations cannot be accounted for by occupational characteristics and unmeasured worker skill or taste differences.MacPherson, D.A., Hirsch, B.T. (1995). Wages and gender composition: why do women's jobs pay less. Journal of Labor Economics, 13(3), pp. 426-471. With regard to part- time workers, Hirsch has argued that the gap in hourly wages between part-time and full-time workers is mostly due to differences between workers, especially in terms of skills that are built up more slowly for part-time workers.Hirsch, B.T. (2005). Why do part-time workers earn less? The role of worker and job skills. ILR Review, 58(4), pp. 525-551. Finally, with regard to the union wage gap, in work with Edward Schumacher, Hirsch has highlighted that the gap between the wages of union and non-union workers in 1973-2001 was likely higher than estimated.Hirsch, B.T., Schumacher, E.J. (2004). Match bias in wage gap estimates due to earnings imputation. Journal of Labor Economics, 22(3), pp. 689-722. * Older workers in the U.S. faced particularly high barriers in the 1980s and 1990s in occupations with steep wage profiles, pension benefits and widespread computer use, with union coverage being a further cause of limitation for older and most older women concentrating in flex-time or part-time occupations.Hirsch, B.T., MacPherson, D.A., Hardy, M.A. (2000). Occupational age structure and access for older workers. ILR Review, 53(3), pp. 401-418. * Most recently, work by Hirsch, Kaufman and Zelenska has drawn attention to the various channels through which employment adjusts to minimum wages, including through changes in prices, profits, wages, turnover and performance.Hirsch, B.T., Kaufman, B.E., Zelenska, T. (2015). Minimum wage channels of adjustment. Industrial Relations, 54(2), pp. 199-239.  Bibliography (selected) * Hirsch, B.T., Addison, J.T. (1986).

He is best known for producing video content for his YouTube channel, DramaAlert.  Career  = History = Keem's first appearance on YouTube was in a Halo 3 YouTube video from 2009, where he was recorded through the online multiplayer voice-chat. His first YouTube channel, 'xDJKEEMSTAR', was created in 2009, and dedicated to reporting on news within the YouTube community. In June 2014, he registered the channel 'DramaAlert'. Keem often offers his own opinions on subjects he reports on. = Controversies = In 2008, during an argument with a moderator named Alex on the website BattleCam.com, Keem encouraged his viewers to type \\"Alex is a stupid nigger\\" in the stream's chat; he later apologized for using the racist slur. In January 2016, Keem posted a tweet directed at TotalBiscuit, a YouTuber who had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer, saying that he couldn't wait to report on his death. Keem later apologized for the tweet. In January 2019, YouTuber Jake Paul accused Keem of body-shaming Paul's then-girlfriend, Erika Costell, after Keem made a tweet comparing her body to Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber with an eating disorder. In June 2019, after YouTuber Etika committed suicide, several Twitter users blamed Keem for 'egging on' the YouTuber, with much of the criticism founded in an interview earlier that year where Keem said \\"If you really think about it, then why live? Just jump off a cliff. If it‚Äôs just a simulation, who cares?\\" in response to Etika talking about how he believed he lived in a simulation. Etika also mentioned Keem in his last video titled \\"I'm sorry\\", saying, \\"Keemstar, I wish you the best my nigga\\". Keem refuted these claims in a series of Tweets, claiming people were using him as a scapegoat and that nobody was talking about tweets in which he was concerned for him. He went on to say that he thought Etika's mental health issues were a publicity stunt, due to him seeming fine and wanting to guest star on DramaAlert. Etika's mother allegedly defended Keem by texting him afterwards, stating he wasn't to blame for Etika's suicide and that he loved Keem and his show. In May 2020, YouTuber Ethan Klein released a video expos√© about Keemstar, which resulted in G Fuel ending their sponsorship with him.

Enrico was a scion of the Filangieri family, the son of Guido, lord of Nocera, and nephew of Marino Filangieri, archbishop of Bari (died 1251). He had two brothers: Pietro (died 1290), a papal chaplain, and Riccardo, who was made count of Marsico by King Manfred. He was born before 1220 and entered the Dominican Order, probably joining the convent established in Naples by Tommaso Agni da Lentini in 1231. He received a higher education, probably also in Naples. By 1243, Enrico had left the Kingdom of Sicily because of the Emperor Frederick II's hostility to his family. While he was still in exile, he was appointed archbishop of Bari at Perugia on 6 May 1252 by the papal legate Pietro da Collemezzo, acting on the orders of Pope Innocent IV, who ratified the appointment on 10 May. He was unable to take control of his diocese, however, owing to the rebellion launched by his uncle, Riccardo Filangieri, then podest√† of Naples. In Enrico's absence, King Conrad IV, who had succeeded Frederick II in 1250, appointed a German named Conrad to the vacant archdiocese. In March 1253, upon Enrico's request, Innocent quashed all the confirmations and concessions that the anti-bishop Conrad had made. Throughout 1253‚Äì54, he stayed with the Roman curia as it travelled between Perugia, Anagni and Rome. In order to give him a salary, Innocent entrusted to him the administration of the vacant bishopric of Albano. In December 1253, the pope gave Enrico the nearby castle of Ariccia. Together these provided him with a living and enough to support his relatives who had gone into exile after the defeat of Riccardo's rebellion. With Conrad IV's death, Enrico was finally able to visit his diocese. On 3 October 1254, while he was still with the curia at Anagni, he reached an agreement with the chapter of the cathedral of Bari to head off the disputes that had paralyzed the episcopate of his uncle. By November 1254, Manfred, then acting as regent for his nephew, King Conradin, had abandoned the German anti-bishop and recognised Enrico. The latter was consecrated in Bari in 1255. In March 1256, on the orders of Pope Alexander IV, Enrico transferred Pietro di Cidonio, bishop-elect of Minervino, to the diocese of Canne. In August 1258, Enrico assisted at the coronation of Manfred in Palermo, completing his transformation from enemy of the Staufer dynasty into ally. He died in Naples on 10 October 1258 and was buried in the basilica of San Domenico Maggiore. His death was recorded in the necrology of the church of Santa Patrizia and the libro dei suffragi (book of suffrages) of the cathedral of Bari. In October 1259, Pope Alexander IV ordered that the part of Enrico's inheritance left in San Domenico Maggiore go to his successor at Bari, Giovanni Saraceno, and the part in possession of his brother Pietro be handed over to the Dominican convent at Foggia.

Another source was a notebook kept by a Samurai doctor named Yamashina D≈çan, which dealt with Konoe's activities and mentions Watanabe four times. This notebook was later lost in a fire. In 1717, he was known to be in the Imperial service. In 1735, he completed copies of a set of scrolls known as the Kasuga Gongen Genki, dating from the kamakura period, which are now kept in the Y≈çmei Bunko, an historical archive in Ky≈çto.

He began his career as a nephrologist and later became a paediatric immunologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Biography John Soothill was born in 1925 in Blackheath, London. His father was the chief medical officer in Norwich and his grandfather, William Edward Soothill, had been the first professor of sinology at Oxford University. He attended The Leys School, Cambridge, and in spite of his dyslexia went on to study medicine at Christ's College, Cambridge. He completed his national service in Germany, did his clinical training at Guy's Hospital and Lewisham Hospital. In 1955 he travelled to Chicago on a Fulbright Scholarship, where he studied the recently developed technique of renal biopsy. Soothill began working at Birmingham University's experimental pathology department in 1956 as a nephrologist. His work at Birmingham centred around kidney disease, immunoglobins and the complement system. He also pioneered the use of cyclophosphamide in children with relapsing nephrotic syndrome. In 1965 Soothill moved from Birmingham to the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, where he was appointed the first Hugh Greenwood Professor of Immunology, a post he would hold for 20 years. One of his main achievements at Great Ormond Street was classifying the different subtypes of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The disease, informally known as \\"boy in the bubble syndrome\\" after David Vetter, was given its current name by Soothill in the 1970s. He also focused on childhood allergies, proposing the theory that allergies and eczema resulted from the exposure to allergens in the first six months of a baby's life. He pioneered the use of elimination diets whereby a child with an unknown food allergy is denied all possible allergic sources in their diet, then each food is reintroduced one by one until the causative food is identified. Soothill retired in 1985 to Devon with his wife Brenda Thornton, whom he had married in 1951. He died on 23 September 2004 in Axminster.

Earlier this place was called as Thiruthudisaimpathy, later it become as Thudiyalur. It is one of the ancient temples in the city which is more than 1300+ years old and it is one among most important Siva Temples in Coimbatore. It is believed to have been constructed by Chozha kings in the 7th century.

The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of Government of Tamil Nadu. History As per Sthala Puranam, once Sundaramurthy Nayanar was travelling in this area. After having darshan at Avinashi, he came this side and he was very tired and hungry. He prayed to the Lord to come to his rescue. At that time, an elderly couple came that side and fed him sumptuous food mainly made with Drumstick leaves and fruits. When Sundarar‚Äôs hunger was satisfied, to his surprise, he found that the couple were none other than Shri Parvathi and Parameswarar. As the Lord offered Virundhu ( feast or food ), He is called Virundeeswarar, is the presiding deity of this temple together with his consort Parvati, who is known as \\"Viswanayaki\\". We usually see Lord Nataraja dancing with his long hair flying wide, the Lord dances here with his hair well dressed. Shiva granted all powers to his vehicle Nandhi at this temple, hence this Nandi is called \\"Adhikara Nandi\\". As per local people, the Adhikara Nandi concept in other temples came into existence after this temple. After Several years, this temple Maha-Kumbhabhishekam was held on 11-July-2019.

During one of his stays in Baghdad, c. 1140, he was educated by leading Muslim scholars for six months. From 1153 to 1154, he was at the court of King Demetrius I of Georgia, as his secretary. Edge of Empires: a History of Georgia by Donald RayfieldIn his works, ibn al-Azraq specifically mentions the Christian king's benevolent treatment of Muslims. He was again in the Kingdom of Georgia in 1162 or 1163, before becoming mutaqalli ishraf al-waqf, that is, custodian of waqf (charitable endowment), in Mayyafariqin in 1166 or 1167. A year later, he served in the same position in Damascus for two years. He then returned to his native city. The year of his death is not certain. His work is a chronicle chiefly focused on Mayyafariqin and Amid in the Diyar Bakr region, but contains important details about the geography and history of the neighboring regions.

Trump briefly stepped over the border at 3:45 PM (GMT+9) on June 30, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot on North Korean soil. It was also the second time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South's territory, following the April 2018 inter-Korean summit.

Trump and Kim held talks on February 27 and 28, 2019, in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, regarding the nuclear issue. At Hanoi, North Korea sought the removal of all significant economic sanctions; in return, it proposed partially reducing its capacity to construct new nuclear weapons, while retaining its existing nuclear arsenal. Trump, meanwhile, offered economic aid to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization.Simon Denyer, North Korea‚Äôs Kim receives 'excellent letter' from Trump, state media says , The Washington Post (June 22, 2019). The two countries did not come to agreement, and talks eventually collapsed.

During the South Korea‚ÄìU.S. Summit, South Korean president Moon Jae-in announced that Trump would be meeting Kim during his visit at the DMZ.

Kim invited Trump to cross the border line, and Trump briefly crossed in North Korea before crossing back into South Korea together with Kim. Trump thus became the first U.S. president to enter North Korea. Before crossing into North Korea, Kim told Trump in Korean, \\"it's good to see you again\\" and \\"I never expected to meet you at this place\\", and shook hands with Trump. Trump said it was \\"my honor\\" to enter North Korea. During their meeting, Trump also invited Kim to the White House, although later acknowledged that this would probably not occur in the near term.

David E. Sanger and Michael Crowley, in an analysis for The New York Times, wrote that in the lead-up to the meeting, Trump administration officials had been internally considering the prospect that a new round of U.S.‚ÄìNorth Korea negotiations could lead to the U.S. accepting \\"a nuclear freeze, one that essentially enshrines the status quo, and tacitly accepts the North as a nuclear power,\\" rather than complete denuclearization.In New Talks, U.S. May Settle for a Nuclear Freeze by North Korea , The New York Times (June 30, 2019). Under this possible outcome, North Korea would halt the growth of its nuclear arsenal, but would not dismantle any of the estimated 20-60 existing nuclear weapons already in its stockpile, and would not curb its ballistic missile capabilities. Biegun said that commentary about possible outcomes was speculative and said he was \\"not preparing any new proposal currently\\".

The Ba Congress, also known as the Saint Sava Congress or Great People's Congress, was a meeting of representatives of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá's Chetnik movement between 25 and 28 January 1944 in the village of Ba in the German-occupied territory of Serbia during World War II. The congress aimed to advance a political alternative to the November 1943 Second Session of the communist-led Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (, AVNOJ) of the Yugoslav Partisans. The Second Session of AVNOJ had resolved that post-war Yugoslavia would be a federal republic, based on six constituent republics, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, with equal rights. Along with this resolution, AVNOJ had asserted that it was the sole legitimate government of Yugoslavia, and denied the right of King Peter II to return from exile before a popular referendum to determine the future of his rule. In December, the major Allied powers met at Tehran and decided to provide their exclusive support to the Partisans and withdraw support from the Chetniks. The congress was held in circumstances where large parts of the Chetnik movement had been drawn into collaboration with the occupying forces, and it has been argued by Jozo Tomasevich and Marko Attila Hoare that the congress was held with the tacit approval of the Germans. At the congress, a new political party was formed, the Yugoslav Democratic National Union (, JDNZ), and the pre-war leader of the small Socialist Party, ≈Ωivko Topaloviƒá, was appointed as its chairman. The congress denounced the decisions of AVNOJ as \\"the work of the Ustasha-Communist minority\\", a continuation of the existing Chetnik propaganda that the Partisans and the Ustashas had united to exterminate Serbs. It also provided its full support to the Yugoslav government-in-exile, the Chetniks and Mihailoviƒá's military leadership, and re-asserted the Chetnik movement's opposition to the Germans and all their allies. It further resolved to mobilise all anti-communist Serbs to fight for the survival of Serbdom. Lastly, it proposed its own vision for the political and socio-economic future of Yugoslavia. This political framework included a Serb sovereign and a tripartite federal state, with entities for the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes only, with the Serb unit being dominant. This was reminiscent of Homogenous Serbia, a document produced several years earlier by the Chetnik ideologue Stevan Moljeviƒá. The principal outcome of the congress was the creation of the JDNZ, a political party formed to unite all elements of the Chetnik movement. It also resulted in a short period of reduced collaboration with the Germans and the forces of the puppet Government of National Salvation in the German- occupied territory of Serbia. However, at this stage of the war, and with the change in Allied policy towards the Chetniks, there was nothing that could be done to improve the position of the movement, and Mihailoviƒá was dropped as a minister of the government-in-exile soon after.  Background  alt=a coloured map showing the partition of Yugoslavia In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was drawn into World War II when Germany and its allies invaded and occupied the country, which was then partitioned. Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbours: Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Germans engineered and supported the creation of the Ustasha puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre- war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. Before the defeat, King Peter II and his government went into exile, reforming in June as the Western Allied-recognised Yugoslav government-in-exile in London. Two resistance movements soon emerged in occupied Yugoslavia: the almost exclusively ethnic Serb and monarchist Chetniks, led by Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá; and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans, under Josip Broz Tito. The approaches of the two resistance movements differed in important respects from the beginning. The Chetniks under Mihailoviƒá advocated a \\"wait-and-see\\" strategy of building up an organisation for a struggle which was to commence when the Western Allies arrived in Yugoslavia, thereby limiting losses in military and civilian personnel alike until the final phase of the war. On the other hand, the Partisans were implacably opposed to the Axis occupation and resisted consistently from the beginning. The Chetnik political agenda was a return to the Serb-dominated Yugoslavia of the interwar period, whereas the Partisans strove to create a social revolution in a multi-ethnic but communist-dominated Yugoslavia. During the early years of the war, the Chetniks failed to articulate or promote a strong political agenda. According to the historian and political scientist Kirk Ford, it is possible that Mihailoviƒá believed that he did not need to do so, as he had been a representative of the government-in-exile since January 1942. In different parts of the country the Chetnik movement was progressively drawn into collaboration agreements: first with the forces of the puppet Government of National Salvation in the German- occupied territory of Serbia, then with the Italians in occupied Dalmatia and Montenegro, with some of the Ustasha forces in the northern Bosnia region of the NDH, and, after the Italian capitulation in September 1943, with the Germans directly. On 29 October 1943, Adolf Hitler authorised German headquarters to utilise \\"national anti-Communist forces\\" to fight insurgencies in southeastern Europe. By the end of the year, due to a drift towards collaboration, the Government of National Salvation and the Germans were at least as influential over the Chetnik movement in the German-occupied territory of Serbia as Mihailoviƒá, who was becoming increasingly isolated. Prelude Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá (centre with glasses) confers with his political adviser Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá (second from right) and others By mid-1943, Mihailoviƒá had realised that he needed to broaden the political appeal of the Chetnik movement. Reverses in Montenegro and Herzegovina had shown that the Chetnik political program was producing unsatisfactory results, and the Western Allies were concerned that the Chetnik movement was anti-democratic, or possibly even fascist. The veneer of democracy advanced by the Partisans was appealing to the Western Allies, and Mihailoviƒá was concerned that the support he was receiving would shift to them. In order to widen the base of the Chetnik movement, Mihailoviƒá contacted representatives of the pre-war political parties living in Belgrade. He assured them that the former illiberal approach of the movement, as advocated by his close political advisers, the former republican and Black Hand adherent Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá and the Chetnik ideologue Stevan Moljeviƒá, had been replaced with a commitment to democracy. The politicians responded to Mihailoviƒá's approach positively as they were concerned about the outcome of the war, and neither a communist nor Chetnik military dictatorship appealed to them. According to the historian Lucien Karchmar, the politician that appears to have taken the lead in these negotiations was the leader of the small pre-war Socialist Party, ≈Ωivko Topaloviƒá. Topaloviƒá contacted members of the pre-war United Opposition, such as the leader of the Independent Democratic Party, Adam Pribiƒáeviƒá, and the leader of the People's Radical Party, Aca Stanojeviƒá. Both Pribiƒáeviƒá and Stanojeviƒá were only the nominal leaders of their respective parties, as the real decision-makers in their parties were with the government-in-exile in London. The political parties agreed that they would negotiate with Mihailoviƒá as a group. Each party nominated two delegates to a coordinating council, and the council selected four negotiators, led by Topaloviƒá, who were to work out the details of an agreement with the Chetnik leader. These negotiations dragged on, and there was one break of two months between discussions. On the Chetnik side, Moljeviƒá and his supporters suggested that the politicians join the Chetnik movement, which they considered apolitical, but the politicians refused to be absorbed in this way. Instead, they demanded a new political grouping be formed, of which the Chetnik movement would be just one part, and that this new grouping would lay out a new program for the future. Further demands were for a reaffirmation of the Yugoslav idea, a parliamentary system and social reforms, a federally organised country, improved relationships with the British, and a new attempt at reconciliation with the Partisans, preferably with the help of the Allies. Some of Mihailoviƒá's followers were against agreeing to the politicians' demands. Nevertheless, the Chetnik leader accepted them, with the proviso that the politicians firmly commit to the agreement. The politicians were loath to do this, as if they signed any document it could be used against them by the Germans, forcing them to leave Belgrade and join Mihailoviƒá in the field. The next step was the calling of a congress to ratify the new political structure and announce the new program. Mihailoviƒá advanced the date of 1 December, which was the anniversary of the founding of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of Yugoslavia since 1929) in 1918, but the politicians delayed the preparations as they continued to negotiate and hesitate. The Second Session of AVNOJ posed a serious political threat to the Chetniks. Pictured at Jajce (seated from left) Josip Broz Tito, Josip Vidmar, Edvard Kocbek, Josip Rus and Mo≈°a Pijade When it was finally held, the Ba Congress, also known as the Saint Sava Congress or Great People's Congress, was conducted in the shadow of two threats, which affected both the Chetniks and the leaders of the political parties in pre-war Yugoslavia who now supported them. The first of these was that the Partisans had widened their appeal by advancing the idea of unity among Yugoslav peoples as free and equal members of the country. This had attracted many people to their cause. This approach was formalised by the resolution of the Second Session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (, AVNOJ) in the Bosnian town of Jajce in November 1943, which decided to create a federal Yugoslavia, based on six constituent republics with equal rights, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Along with this resolution, AVNOJ asserted that it was the sole legitimate government of Yugoslavia, and denied the right of King Peter to return from exile before a popular referendum to determine the future of his rule. The Western Allies expressed no opposition to the resolutions of AVNOJ, and at the Tehran Conference of 28 November to 1 December, the Allies had agreed to throw their support behind the Partisans. The second threat was the fact that from mid-1943, the British, who had primacy regarding Allied policy in Yugoslavia, had begun to doubt their decision to support Mihailoviƒá. By December they had concluded that Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks were more interested in collaborating with the Axis against the Partisans than in fighting the Axis. In late 1943, the Partisans, who had enjoyed considerable success in the rest of Yugoslavia in the wake of the September capitulation of the Italians, had been stymied in an attempt to break into the German-occupied territory of Serbia from the neighbouring occupied territories of Montenegro, Sand≈æak and eastern Bosnia. The German-led operation that stopped the Partisan incursion, Operation Kugelblitz, included Bulgarian and collaborating Chetnik units. While unsuccessful in destroying the targeted Partisan formations, it did delay their entry into Serbian territory. The Chetniks took advantage of this delay, which, combined with the relative protection afforded by armistice agreements they had made with the Germans in November, allowed them to convoke the Ba Congress as a striking political gesture aimed at addressing the resolutions of AVNOJ and providing an alternative political vision for post- war Yugoslavia. It was also conceived as a means of changing the minds of the Allies ‚Äì but particularly the US ‚Äì about the decisions of the Tehran Conference that withdrew support for the Chetnik movement. Another aim was to broaden political support for the movement through a program that, while remaining fiercely anti-communist, had enough democratic elements to have widespread support among the population.  Participants  The congress was organised by Mihailoviƒá and occurred between 25 and 28 January 1944 in the village of Ba, near Valjevo in the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Approximately 300 civilians participated, almost all of whom were Serbs from Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia together with two or three Croats, one Slovene and one Bosnian Muslim. The non-Serb representation was effectively tokenistic. Delegates from Herzegovina and Dalmatia were unable to attend in time. The delegates included principal Chetnik commanders, politicians who had joined the Chetnik cause at the beginning, such as Vasiƒá and Moljeviƒá, representatives of old Serb political parties who had decided to join with the Chetniks later on, and others. The politicians included Topaloviƒá and Pribiƒáeviƒá. Virtually all of the pre-war political parties were represented in some way, excluding the communists and fascist-aligned groups. This was the first and only time during the war that the main Chetnik commanders and closely aligned politicians met with Chetnik supporters among the pre-war political parties. The Chetnik old guard were originally opposed to the involvement of the recently aligned pre-war politicians, and according to Mihailoviƒá they were only included at his insistence. Mihailoviƒá was also opposed to Vasiƒá having a significant role in the congress, because he and Vasiƒá were now regularly on opposing sides in discussions. Vasiƒá was only included at Topaloviƒá's urging. A significant number of the younger Chetnik leaders considered the pre-war politicians to be of poor quality and character, and obstacles to political, social and economic reforms after the war. Given that the Germans could easily have prevented it from occurring or disrupted it once underway, it has been argued that the congress was held with the tacit approval of the Germans. Mihailoviƒá failed to comply with a request from British General Henry Maitland Wilson (pictured) to attack railway bridges The congress was also attended by Lieutenant George Musulin, one of the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) officers attached to the British mission to Mihailoviƒá, largely at his own initiative. He was the only Allied representative who attended. On 8 December 1943, in the wake of the Tehran Conference decision, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, General Henry Maitland Wilson had sent a message to Mihailoviƒá asking him to attack two specific bridges on the Belgrade to Salonika railway line. This message was a test formulated by the British to assess Mihailoviƒá's intentions regarding resisting the Germans, and was done with the expectation that he would continue his inactivity against the Germans and not comply. The chief of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) mission to the Chetniks, Brigadier Charles Armstrong, followed this up with written orders on 16 December, directing Mihailoviƒá to carry out the sabotage on the two bridges by 29 December. The attacks were never carried out. Armstrong refused to participate in the congress because of the Chetnik failure to carry out the sabotage operations. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill used Mihailoviƒá's refusal as an opportunity to tell King Peter about the Tehran Conference decision that the Allies would be backing Tito exclusively, and that Mihailoviƒá might have to be dismissed as a minister in the government-in- exile.  Discussions  The night before the congress, Moljeviƒá and the long- term Chetnik supporters clashed with Topaloviƒá and the politicians, but Mihailoviƒá decided in favour of the latter. Mihailoviƒá made a personal address to the congress, pledging his loyalty to the king, to the rule of law and to Yugoslavia, and repeatedly denied he had any tendencies towards dictatorship. He also rejected the idea of taking collective revenge against any nationality or political faction for crimes committed during the war. He forcefully refused to join the drift into collaboration affecting much of the Chetnik movement at the time of the congress, but his repeated denials about plans for a military dictatorship indicate an understandable lack of confidence from the politicians in this regard. Mihailoviƒá was not overtly involved in the following discussions. In common with political practice under the period of royal dictatorship from 1929, the congress formed a new political party, the Yugoslav Democratic National Union (, JDNZ), and Topaloviƒá was appointed as its chairman. Despite the very small size of the Socialist Party before the war, Topaloviƒá was apparently chosen due to his links with two Labour Party members of the Churchill war ministry, Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin. The committee established for the new party included a large number of Serbs and Montenegrins, as well as three Croats ‚Äì Vladimir Predavec, Djuro Viloviƒá, and Niko Bartuloviƒá. It also included a Slovenian refugee, Anton Krejƒái, and a Bosnian Muslim, Mustafa Mulaliƒá. Among the non-Serbs, only Mulaliƒá was a pre- war politician, from the Yugoslav National Party. Topaloviƒá's election was a victory for the moderates among the delegates, and constituted a setback for the extremist Greater Serbia elements represented by Vasiƒá and Moljeviƒá, which had dominated the Chetnik political program up to this point. Views on the character of the congress have varied between those with long-standing ties to the Chetnik movement, and those pre-war politicians that had only recently come to support it. Both groups felt they had an equal stake in the future of Yugoslavia. The Chetniks saw the JDNZ as the expanded political wing of Mihailoviƒá's movement, with Mihailoviƒá to retain all military and political power, whereas Topaloviƒá saw the Chetniks as the military arm under the primacy of the new party. It quickly became clear that the two sides could not easily agree on even procedural matters, let alone on final resolutions. Topaloviƒá proposed that Bosnia should be a fourth federal unit, but this was opposed by Vasiƒá and Moljeviƒá. Moljeviƒá was also opposed to the creation of the JDNZ, and only wanted an expansion of the existing Chetnik Central Committee, of which he was a long-standing member. During the congress, the assembled representatives sent a message of solidarity to the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin.  Resolutions  After three days of debate, the congress made resolutions regarding both military and political matters. Firstly, it denounced the decisions of AVNOJ as \\"the work of the Ustasha-Communist minority\\", in accordance with the existing Chetnik propaganda that the Partisans and the Ustashas had united to exterminate Serbs. It also provided its full support to the Yugoslav government-in-exile, the Chetniks, and Mihailoviƒá's military leadership, claiming that Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks were a truly national army. It re-asserted the Chetnik movement's opposition to Germany and its allies, and resolved to mobilise all anti-communist Serbs to fight for the survival of Serbdom. Lastly, it proposed its own vision for the political and socio-economic future of Yugoslavia. The congress denounced AVNOJ's change to the constitutional organization of Yugoslavia, called on the Partisans to abandon political actions until the end of the war, and adopted a high-minded but somewhat imprecise resolution known as the Ba Resolution (). The principal document was called The Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement and came in two parts. The first part, The Yugoslav Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement stated that: *a restored and enlarged Yugoslavia would be a national state of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; *national minorities who were enemies of Yugoslavia and the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes would be expelled from Yugoslav territory; *Yugoslavia would be organised on a democratic basis as a federation consisting of three units, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia; and *all three peoples of Yugoslavia would organise their own internal affairs as their representatives chose. The second part, The Serbian Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement stated that all Serbian provinces would be united in the Serbian unit within the federal arrangement, based on the solidarity between all Serb regions of Yugoslavia, under a unicameral parliament. The congress also resolved that Yugoslavia should be a constitutional monarchy headed by a Serb sovereign. Further, the congress resolved that it would not form a government as AVNOJ had done, and called upon the Partisans to follow democratic process. According to the historians Radovan Samard≈æiƒá and Milan Du≈°kov, the main principle of the programme of the Ba Congress was social-democratic Yugoslavism. They claim the resolutions of the Ba Congress were \\"better founded, culturally and historically\\" than the framework proposed by AVNOJ. The congress marked a change in the Chetnik main political objective; instead of their earlier aim to restore the centralised pre-war kingdom, they changed their approach towards a federal state structure with a dominant Serb federal unit. A map showing the extent of Greater Serbia (in blue) as envisaged by Moljeviƒá in Homogeneous Serbia By agreeing to the resolutions of the congress, the Chetnik leadership sought to undermine Partisan accusations that they were dedicated to a return to pre-war Serb hegemony and a Greater Serbia. The historian Jozo Tomasevich observes that in asserting the need to gather all Serbs into a single entity, The Serbian Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement was reminiscent of Homogeneous Serbia, written by Moljeviƒá several years earlier, which advocated a Greater Serbia. He also notes that the congress did not recognise Macedonia and Montenegro as separate nations, and also implied that Croatia and Slovenia would effectively be appendages to the Serbian entity. The net effect of this, according to Tomasevich, was that the country would not only return to the same Serb-dominated state it had been in during the interwar period, but would be worse than that, particularly for the Croats. He concludes that this outcome was to be expected given the overwhelmingly Serb makeup of the congress. The historian Marko Attila Hoare agrees that despite its superficial Yugoslavism, the congress had clear Greater Serbia inclinations, and the historian Lucien Karchmar concludes that the usage of the term \\"Saint Sava Congress\\" reinforced the impression that it was focussed on the aspirations of Serbs rather than Yugoslavs in general. In terms of the socio-economic future of Yugoslavia, the congress expressed an interest in reforming the economic, social, and cultural position of the country, particularly regarding democratic ideals. This was a significant departure from previous Chetnik goals expressed earlier in the war, especially in terms of promoting democratic principles with some socialist features. Tomasevich observes that these new goals were probably more related to achieving propaganda objectives than reflecting actual intentions, given that there was no real interest in considering the needs of the non-Serb peoples of Yugoslavia. It seems unlikely that the Chetnik movement was fully aware of the radicalised mood amongst the general population. The most important practical outcome of the congress was the creation of the JDNZ, because all of the representatives present agreed to avoid independent political action until conditions in Yugoslavia were normalised. The existing Chetnik Central National Committee was to be expanded to include representatives of all those that participated in the congress. The selection of the new Central National Committee members was delegated to an \\"organisational committee of three\\", comprising Topaloviƒá, Vasiƒá and Moljeviƒá, who were to consult with the various leaders. The outcomes of the congress meant that Mihailoviƒá now had the endorsement of the People's Radical Party, the Democratic Party, the Independent Democratic Party, the Agrarian Party, the Socialist Party and the Republican Party. Claims by Chetnik adherents that this aspect of the Ba Congress demonstrated \\"overwhelming popular support\\" for Mihailoviƒá are seriously flawed, as they fail to recognise that the pre-war Yugoslav political parties were not mass-membership organisations, and support from the leaders in no way assured support from those that voted for the various parties in the most recent election in 1938. The participants also hoped that the resolutions would restore the Chetnik relationship with the Western Allies, particularly the Churchill government and British public.  Aftermath  SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer and Generalleutnant der Polizei August Meyszner received detailed reports on the congress Having not attended the congress, the British had no first-hand intelligence about the discussions. Only in April did the SOE contact Musulin and ask for a report. Having received it, the British were hesitant to accept the new political program on its face value. Assessing that Mihailoviƒá's situation was increasingly desperate, they were not keen to enable a late attempt to save what they already thought was a lost cause. Topaloviƒá later acknowledged that the congress was not as \\"imposing nor as grand as its own propaganda and the publicity given to it by its friends made it appear to be.\\" In May, the British mission to Mihailoviƒá was withdrawn. The following month, Mihailoviƒá was dropped as a minister in the Yugoslav government-in-exile, removing his legitimacy. From this point, he treated the government-in-exile as his enemy, and had to go on alone. The Germans were very interested in the congress, and German agents provided a detailed account of it to the Higher SS and Police Leader in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, SS- and , August Meyszner. These reports mentioned the frequent anti- German outbursts that had occurred. The Germans were concerned about the outcomes of the congress, and they may have had some limited consequences in military terms, as the formal armistice agreements between the Germans and Chetniks ended soon after the congress. In practical terms, despite Mihailoviƒá's opposition to the slide towards collaboration, co-operation still continued, forced by the deteriorating situation for the Germans and their collaborators in the occupied territory. The congress was followed by a significant deterioration in the relationships between the Chetnik movement and the collaborationist formations of the Government of National Salvation in occupied Serbia, led by Milan Nediƒá. The Yugoslav government-in-exile reported at the beginning of March 1944 that in response to the congress, the Gestapo and Serbian puppet government arrested 798 people in Belgrade and held them in prison as hostages, threatening to shoot 100 of them for each German soldier killed in Serbia. A number of Mihailoviƒá supporters, including some of the politicians, were rounded up by the Germans as part of this sweep, and at least one politician was executed. A number of the politicians who had accepted positions on the new Central National Committee were forced to flee and seek Mihailoviƒá's protection. During the congress, Mihailoviƒá mentioned to Musulin that Chetniks had picked up some American aircrew who had crashed near Ni≈° in southeastern Serbia. Musulin saw this as an opportunity to extend his stay with the Chetniks, and once they arrived at Chetnik headquarters, Musulin contacted OSS Cairo to obtain approval to enlist Chetnik assistance to evacuate them from occupied territory. On 6 March, he received approval to take this action. Musulin was supposed to depart on the flight that extracted the aircrew, but delayed his departure due to illness, but also because he wished to stay with the Chetniks and gather intelligence. On 20 May, he asked approval from OSS Cairo to remain, but this was denied, and he was extracted to Italy on 28 May with the rest of the British mission to the Chetniks. A new OSS mission, Operation Halyard, arrived in August to utilise Chetnik assistance in evacuating downed fliers from occupied Serbia. Musulin was initially the leader of the Operation Halyard team. When he departed in May, Musulin was accompanied by Topaloviƒá, who led a diplomatic mission on behalf of Mihailoviƒá to try to reverse the Allied decision to abandon the Chetniks. This effort was abortive, as the British did not allow him to leave Italy and would not reconsider their policy of supporting Tito and the Partisans. Topaloviƒá was replaced as chairman of the Central National Committee by Mihailo Kujund≈æiƒá, who had a heart attack and died soon after. He was replaced by Moljeviƒá. The new chairman had never reconciled himself with the new political structure, and railed against it, especially as it failed to garner results for the Chetnik movement. There remained a significant gap between those who had embraced the new political structure and those that adhered to the original Chetnik ideology, and this divide was carried over into the post- war √©migr√© diaspora. Regardless of the return of Moljeviƒá to the fold, the pre-war politicians remained in evidence, and came into the field to join Mihailoviƒá. King Peter (left in uniform) and Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá in Italy in June 1944 The central committee of the JDNZ had been selected by June, consisting of six members, one each for foreign affairs, legislative affairs, economic and fiscal affairs, nationality questions and propaganda, social affairs, and economic construction. The central committee condemned the new government-in- exile led by Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá, calling its members communist sympathisers and Croat separatists. It also appointed special representatives for the Chetnik movement overseas, including Konstantin Fotiƒá in the United States, Jovan ƒêonoviƒá in Algiers, Bogoljub Jevtiƒá in the UK, General Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá in Italy, and Mladen ≈Ωujoviƒá in Egypt. Within the German-occupied territory of Serbia at least, the Chetnik movement took action to implement the resolutions of the congress. Corps commanders were ordered to modify the administrative arrangements in their areas of responsibility, and new \\"Ravna Gora committees\\" were established in each district () and village to replace the existing administration. New district commanders were appointed, assisted by treasurers and quartermasters. The decrees of the expanded Central National Committee were made binding on all Ravna Gora committees and Chetnik district commanders, and they were only to take orders from the Executive Committee of the Central National Committee, which was also responsible for all propaganda. The Chetniks took over large parts of occupied Serbia outside the towns, pushing the administration of the Nediƒá government into the margins. The central committee met again over the period 20‚Äì23 July, stating that it considered the ≈†uba≈°iƒá government incapable of protecting the interests of Yugoslavia and the king, and reserving the right to take whatever actions it considered necessary to look after Yugoslavia's interests. It was clear that Mihailoviƒá did not accept his removal from his position as a minister in the government in June. When he was dismissed as chief of staff of the Supreme Command in August, he also did not accept this, and continued to refer to the Chetniks as the \\"Yugoslav Army in the Homeland\\", with himself as its chief. The central committee only met twice more between July 1944 and March 1945. In August, several members of the central committee, including Pribiƒáeviƒá, Vladimir Belajƒçiƒá and Ivan Kovaƒç, along with a senior Chetnik commander, Major Zvonimir Vuƒçkoviƒá, were sent to join Topaloviƒá in Italy. Their pleas for a change of policy towards the Chetniks were in vain. Mihailoviƒá disestablished the central committee just before he was forced to withdraw from Serbia to northeast Bosnia in mid-September 1944, as he considered that he could only take fighting men with him. Regardless, most of the members of the central committee accompanied him. Eventually, Mihailoviƒá and Moljeviƒá fell out over the relationship of the Chetnik movement with the Germans, and Moljeviƒá resigned and was not replaced. This was the end of the Chetnik political organisation given form at Ba. Despite being planned well before the Second Session of AVNOJ was held, the Ba Congress was widely seen as a response to it. The congress was by far the most important political event for Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks during the war. Regardless of the internal changes wrought by the congress, it did not prevent the Western Allies from breaking off contact with the Chetnik movement, and there was no rapprochement with the Partisans. Given the situation in Yugoslavia in early 1944, combined with the split between the British and Chetniks over the latter's failure to resist the Germans, the congress did nothing to improve the position of the Chetnik movement.

MSubs are an underwater R&D; company that have built a number of specialist unmanned and manned submersibles, primarily for the US DoD. MSubs is wholly owned by Submergence Group LLC, a small Texas based company that provides the linkages into the DOD and is responsible for contract support, most notably operator training. Due to the nature of the contract Lockheed Martin were nominated as the prime contractor with Submergence Group as the sub contractor. With the exception of a limited amount of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), manufacture, assembly and initial sea trials all take place in the UK. DCS is designed for use by the United States Navy SEALs for insertion on special operations missions. It will replace the canceled Advanced SEAL Delivery System and will serve alongside the Shallow Water Combat Submersible. As the name suggests, the Dry Combat Submersible has a dry interior, enabling longer mission durations in colder water. The DCS is designated the S351 Nemesis. Lockheed Martin and the Submergence Group were awarded the $166 million, 5-year contract to develop and build three DCSs in June 2016. By 2018, the total spent on the submersibles rose to $236 million. Design The Dry Combat Submersible is long and has a beam and height of . The submersible weighs fully loaded and has a displacement of . It can be transported in a standard 40-foot shipping container. The DCS has a crew of two‚Äìa pilot and a co-pilot/navigator‚Äìand carries eight fully equipped SEALs. The DCS has three dry, pressurized sections: a fore transport compartment for carrying troops, an amidships swimmer lock-in/lock-out compartment, and an aft command center where the pilot and co-pilot operate the sub. Though its exact performance remains classified, the DCS is stated to have a maximum depth rating of and Lock In and Out maximum depth of . Its batteries give it a range of at a speed of , although its maximum speed is not public. Lockheed Martin claims that the DCS has an endurance greater than 24 hours, triple that of the current SEAL Delivery Vehicle and twice that of the Shallow Water Combat Submersible the DCS will serve alongside. Unlike its predecessor, the Dry Combat Submersible will be deployed from surface ships rather than from larger submarines. Surface ships will lower it into the water with a crane or deploy it from an opening in the bottom of their hulls. However, the Navy plans to study integrating the DCS with a larger submarine will begin in FY2020. The DCS' main advantage over its predecessors is its dry environment, which enables SEALs to undertake longer missions in colder water and be more combat- ready when they deploy. Another advantage is that the SEALs can communicate more easily in the DCS than in previous wet submarines, where they had to rely on intercoms and could not see each other. SEALs deploy from the DCS in diving gear and swim the rest of the way to their target. The DCS' navigational systems include an inertial navigation system and Doppler Velocity Log. The sensor suite consists of sonar and a fathometer, although additional sensors can be added depending on mission requirements. The communications equipment includes an underwater telephone and UHF radio. History The Dry Combat Submersible has been developed from MSub's existing S302 mini-sub, which is itself an improved version of the S301i. Both the S302 and S301i are produced for export by MSubs in collaboration with the Submergence Group. The S301i is capable of fitting in the dry deck shelters used on larger American and British submarines, although the S302 and the DCS are larger than the S301i and so cannot fit in dry deck shelters. The design and requirements for the DCS were initially formulated by the U.S. Special Operations Command as early as 2014, although the technology to make the DCS did not catch up to the requirements until more recently. The first lithium-ion batteries for the DCS were delivered to the Navy by General Atomics in February 2018. , the first of the subs is undergoing advanced sea trials in the US with the second in production in the UK Delivery of all three submersibles is expected to take place by . The first DCS with LiFT (Lithium-ion Fault Tolerant) battery system was accepted by USSOCOM on April 21, 2020. General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems is providing LiFT long-lifecycle batteries to power the propulsion and internal support systems of DCS.

Her father died during the Second World War, and her mother moved to Munich with her and her older sister. At the request of her mother, Elchlepp first studied fashion graphic design in Munich, and simultaneously undertook voice training. An Austrian producer became aware of her, and thus Elchlepp, who called herself Dominique as a protest singer, signed her first record contract in 1965. She began with hits and scored her first success with the protest song \\"Der ewige Soldat\\", based on \\"The Universal Soldier\\" by Buffy Sainte-Marie/Donovan, with German lyrics by Max Colpet. Further singles followed and also appeared on her LP Krieg im Frieden.Polydor/stern-musik-Archiv She recorded several songs by Bob Dylan, , Udo Westgard, and Pete Seeger.Dominique ‚Äì Krieg im Frieden (1966) meinsammelsuriumblog.wordpress.com She trained at the opera studio of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, now under the name Isold√© Elchlepp. She appeared in small roles at the Bavarian State Opera, such as Kate Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly in 1973 and in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss in 1975.

Bassett spent her first seven years of life in a government-run orphanage in Nanjing, China after she was found abandoned on the side of a street following the tragic loss of her right leg in a chemical fire as a newborn baby. While growing up, she made a makeshift prosthetic leg using leather belts and masking tape and began to walk, aged six, but never went outside of the orphanage in which she was being raised. Bassett was adopted in 1995 by an American couple from Michigan.  Early Life  After being adopted just shy of her eighth birthday, Bassett grew up in Harbor Springs, Michigan. On growing up in Harbor Springs, Bassett recalls \\"They were so unaccepting of me,\\" she says. \\"The girls were so noninclusive and mean, and being the only Asian in an all-white school was not fun.\\" Scout buried herself in books, plowing through as many political biographies as her brain could digest, and sports, which felt like the easiest and most direct route to assimilation. After completing high school, Bassett attended UCLA on a full scholarship. She graduated in 2011 with degrees in Sociology and Anthropology. Paralympic career Bassett began playing soccer, aged ten before starting her athletic career by participating in the Challenged Athletes Foundation, aged 14, who granted her a prosthetic running leg, then attended the Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center in California at the age of 18. She first started to compete in triathlons and won three silver medals and one bronze medal in the ITU Paratriathlon World Championships, in the 2011 ITU Paratriathlon World Championships, she went to China for the first time since she was adopted. Bassett transitioned to track and field before the paratriathlon event was introduced in the 2016 Summer Paralympics. She did an entire first full season of athletic training attempting to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, when she got the opportunity to try and compete in the US Paralympic team. Bassett came last in the 100m at the US Championships, which was a qualifier for the Paralympic Games, as she failed to make the team and almost decided to quit track and field. In 2015, Bassett still wanted to be a Paralympian and moved to San Diego so that she could do full-time training and she started breaking national records in the T42 classification. She then went on to qualify and compete in the 2016 Summer Paralympic but ended up being fifth in the 100m and tenth in the long jump. In 2017, Bassett successfully attended the 2017 World Para Athletics Championships in London, United Kingdom, where she won her first international medals in the 100m and long jump. She is currently the world record holder in the 400m T42 and American holder in 100m and 200m. In 2019, Bassett took home the gold medal in the Women's Long Jump T42-44/T61-63 at the Parapan American Games in Lima, Peru.

In 1850 with John Webster, he co-founded Wilkie & Webster, a music warehouse in Collins Street, Melbourne, which eventually became Allans Music after George Allan became the sole proprietor. Wilkie served as an early member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1857 to 1861, representing the districts of West Bourke and Polwarth & South Grenville. In 1871, he was declared a lunatic, and restrained at the mental asylum in Cremorne before being returned to England where he died in 1875. Early life Wilkie was born in St Pancras, London to James Wilkie, a pianoforte tuner, and his wife Mary Ann. Wilkie trained in piano tuning and repair with John Broadwood & Sons. Music business 1925 article in The Australian Musical News showing the history of the companies of Wilkie, Webster and Allan which became Allans Music. Wilkie arrived in the colony of Victoria in 1849, and in May 1850 established Wilkie's Music Saloon‚Äîa music warehouse selling and repairing musical instruments and selling sheet music‚Äîwith partner John Campbell Webster at 15 Collins Street East at the site of the present Block Arcade. George Leavis Allan joined the company as a junior partner in 1862, with the firm becoming Wilkie, Webster & Allan. By 1876, Wilkie and Webster had died leaving Allan as the sole proprietor, and the company became Allan & Company. Wilkie also went into partnership with fellow Broadwood apprentice Joseph Kilner, who had begun manufacturing pianos in Melbourne in 1856. In 1863, Wilkie, Kilner & Company opened at 174 Queen Street, Melbourne, and specialised in manufacturing pianos from native Australian timbers, as well as importing international models, until 1866. Political career In 1856, Wilkie nominated as a candidate for the inaugural Victorian Legislative Assembly to represent the electoral district of West Bourke. He was unsuccessful, losing to Patrick Phelan and Robert McDougall, but he was elected in an 1857 by-election following McDougall's resignation. At the 1859 colony elections, Wilkie was elected as member for Polwarth and South Grenville. Electors of West Bourke petitioned Wilkie to return to represent his former district, but he declined, re-nominating for Polwarth and South Grenville, although he was defeated at the 1861 election by William Nixon. Declaration of lunacy In 1871, an inquiry was held into Wilkie's mental state‚Äîas The Argus newspaper put it, \\"signs of insanity inherited from his father\\". He was subsequently declared a \\"lunatic\\" and admitted to a private asylum in Cremorne run by James Thomas Harcourt. In March 1871, Wilkie escaped from the facility by climbing over a fence, and attempted to return to his home in South Yarra by ferry, however he was apprehended by the ferryman and returned to custody. In May 1871, Wilkie's barrister applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for leave to return him to England which was thought would be beneficial for his treatment. Justice Molesworth declined to issue the order until Wilkie's wife had heard from family in England who could support them. In June, with George Gregory appointed committee of Wilkie's estate, the judge issued the order for Wilkie's transfer to England, as well as an allowance for his family and the purchase of furniture. On 15 December 1875, Gregory received a telegram confirming that Wilkie had died in England on 10 December, the day after Justice Molesworth had sanctioned the sale of Wilkie's and Webster's shares in their music firm to George Allan.

The synagogue is located at 120 Siemert Road, New Doornfontein, two blocks from Ellis Park Stadium. To the left of the synagogue was a Jewish Community Center, which was added in the 1950s as part of an extension to the building. This was later sold off and converted for other uses as the congregation's membership resettled to other suburbs. The synagogue was led by Rabbi Ilan Herrmann until 2017. Herrmann had served the congregation for the last 18 years. Today, the synagogue usually has about 60 congregants for weekly Shabbat services and about 200 congregants for the High Holy Days. Most current congregants live outside of Doornfontein, in Sandton, Morningside and Highlands North. History The neighbourhood of Doornfontein was founded in 1886, and after wealthy residents moved to more affluent neighbourhoods in the aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War, Doornfontein became popular with Jewish immigrants from the United Kingdom and Western Europe. Beit Street in Doornfontein was once the commercial hub of the neighborhood, with Kosher butchers and other Jewish merchants. During the 1880s, religious services were held at the nearby Rand Club and at private residences. The Lions Synagogue was the third synagogue to be built in the neighborhood. It was built in 1905 at a cost of ¬£4,000 and nicknamed the \\"Lions Synagogue\\" (also commonly known as Lions Shul) after the two cast iron lions watching over either side of the entrance. The architect was Morrie Jacob Harris. A fire damaged the building in 1930. It has been completely restored, but the original look has therefore changed.

He established the paediatric hepatology unit at King's College Hospital, London, which became a referral centre for children across Britain with liver diseases. Biography Mowat was born in 1935 in Cullen, Moray, and was educated at Aberdeen Medical School, qualifying in 1958. After serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Far East, he returned to Aberdeen to take up a research post in the Rowett Institute's enzymology department. He also completed a two-year fellowship at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, where he studied hepatology (liver medicine). On his return from New York, Mowat became a paediatric registrar at Aberdeen Medical School. Mowat was appointed a consultant paediatrician and paediatric hepatologist to King's College Hospital in London in 1970. At the time, paediatric hepatology was a nascent specialty in medicine, and at King's Mowat established one of the first specialised units to treat children with rare diseases including biliary atresia, portal hypertension and liver cancers. He staffed the unit with a combination of hepatologists, paediatric surgeons, transplant surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, specialist nurses and dieticians. Under Mowat's direction, the unit pioneered new techniques for liver transplantation in children, one of which involves a parent donating part of their liver to the child. In 1986, Mowat received government funding which made the King's paediatric hepatology unit a supraregional referral centre for children all over the United Kingdom. He was appointed professor of paediatric hepatology at King's College in 1990. Mowat was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1975. He authored the textbook Liver Disorders in Childhood, first published in 1979, which was regarded as the leading reference on the subject, and his research group at King's published over 200 articles on the subject of paediatric hepatology. He was made an honorary consultant in paediatrics to the Royal Air Force. Mowat died suddenly in 1995 after giving a lecture at a medical conference in Chile.

She has served as a member of Birmingham City Council from 1996, currently for the ward of Bordesley and Highgate and until 2018 for the ward of Nechells. Mosquito also served as West Midlands Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner between 2012 and 2016, until a suspension in March 2016 after visiting the family of a murder victim. Early life and career Mosquito was born in Balsall Heath and worked at a Saturday school in Handsworth. She then worked for a double glazing company and in the early 1990s worked with young people to help them further their opportunities. In 1996 she was elected to Birmingham City Council as a Labour Party councillor. She is also an ordained minister. West Midlands Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner Having been a Labour Councillor since 1996, in 2012 Mosquito was made the first West Midlands Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner when the position was established. She served under fellow Labour Councillor Bob Jones, who said following his recommendation that \\"she brings a wealth of experience as a councillor, police authority member and community campaigner\\". Following Jones' death in 2014, Mosquito became acting Commissioner, and in June 2014, when David Jamieson was elected as the new Commissioner, Jamieson announced that Mosquito would keep her job as deputy Commissioner. In March 2016 Mosquito was immediately suspended from her role after visiting the family of 18-year-old murder victim Kenichi Phillips, thereby breaching protocol. She confirmed she had been suspended by writing: \\"I can confirm that David Jamieson, the Police and Crime Commissioner, has suspended me. I strenuously deny all of the allegations.\\" However, it was revealed at the end of March that four weeks prior to her suspension, Mosquito had issued a (non formal) complaint about Jamieson's behaviour towards her. The union representing her, Unite, issued a statement at the time saying they were \\"appalled that information that should be private and confidential as part of the disciplinary process has been put into the public domain\\". In April, Maxie Hayes, human rights activist, criticised Mosquito's suspension as \\"heavy- handed\\" and claimed she visited the family as \\"an ordained minister giving condolences to a grieving family\\" rather than in her official capacity. In May, a disciplinary hearing claimed Mosquito committed \\"serious misconduct\\" and asked that she apologise to the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, West Midlands Police, and Phillips's family. Mosquito officially left her post in May. In December, Mosquito arranged for Jamieson to be taken to an employment tribunal which was scheduled for May the following year; however, the tribunal did not take place after Mosquito allegedly received a payout.  Lord Mayor of Birmingham  In May 2018, Mosquito was made Lord Mayor of Birmingham after Lynda Clinton, Labour's original Lord Mayor Elect, lost her seat in Castle Vale ward by 91 votes on 4 May. The formal mover of the motion was Sybil Spence, the first black woman to serve as Lord Mayor. Mosquito herself became the second black woman and ninth woman overall to serve in the role of Lord Mayor. Conservative Anne Underwood (who served as Lord Mayor 2017-2018) labelled her as a 'champion of the underdog'. On 14 May 2019, near the end of her time as Lord Mayor, Mosquito officially opened comedian Joe Lycett's kitchen extension. After Mosquito initially declined to attend as it was not a public event, Lycett raffled four tickets to raise money for charity and allow four members of the public to attend. As it was now a public event, Mosquito agreed to open the kitchen extension. Celebrities such as comedian Katherine Ryan and Sky Sports presenter Lloyd Griffith were also in attendance, and a plaque was placed outside the kitchen extension naming it The Mosquito Wing. In July 2019, Lycett revealed that the raffle made over ¬£3,000 for charity as he presented the money to Mosquito and her successor as Lord Mayor the Liberal Democrats' Mohammed Azim. After Lycett presented the money Mosquito said he \\"captures the spirit of Birmingham.\\"  West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner  In June 2019, Mosquito announced her intention to run as the Labour candidate in the 2020 election for West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner. There were four candidates on the Labour shortlist: herself, former North Warwickshire MP Mike O'Brien, a specialist housing and anti-social behaviour lawyer Simon Foster, and a former assistant chief executive at Sandwell Council Melanie Dudley. In September 2019, Foster was confirmed as the selected candidate.

Several reasons for the creation of these doctored photographs include sexual gratification, stigmatization or embarrassment of the subject, or for commercial gain, such as by selling the photographs on pornography websites. Fakes can be created using image editing software or through machine learning (fake pornographic images created this way are referred to as deepfakes). Many websites host fake nude and pornographic photos of celebrities, which are sometimes referred to as celebrity fakes. Magazines such as Celebrity Skin, which published paparazzi shots and illicitly obtained nude photos, have been cited as precursors to this phenomenon. In the 1990s and 2000s, fake nude images of celebrities proliferated on Usenet and other websites, leading to campaigns to take legal action against the creators of the images and websites dedicated to determining the veracity of nude photos. \\"Deepfakes\\", which use artificial neural networks to superimpose a person's face into a pornographic image or video, were popularized in the late 2010s, leading to concerns about the technology's use in fake news and revenge porn. Purposes The reasons for the creation of nude photos may range from a need to discredit the target publicly, personal hatred for the target, or the promise of pecuniary gains for such work on the part of the creator of such photos. Fake nude photos often target prominent figures such as businesspeople or politicians. This is the case for candidate for Rwanda's presidential election in 2017, Diane Rwigara. Notable cases In 2010, 97 people were arrested in Korea after spreading fake nude pictures of the group Girls' Generation on the internet. In 2011, a 53-year-old Incheon man was arrested after spreading more fake pictures of the same group. In 2012, South Korean police identified 157 Korean artists of whom fake nudes were circulating. In 2012, when Liu Yifei's fake nude photography released on the network, Liu Yifei Red Star Land Company declared a legal search to find out who created and released the photos. In the same year, Chinese actor Huang Xiaoming released nude photos that sparked public controversy, but they were ultimately proven to be real pictures. In 2014, supermodel Kate Upton angrily threatened to sue a website for posting her fake nude photos. Previously, in 2011, this page was threatened by Taylor Swift. In November 2014, singer Bi Rain was angry because of a fake nude photo that spread throughout the internet. Information reveals that: \\"Rain's nude photo was released from Kim Tae-hee's lost phone.\\" Rain's label, Cube Entertainment, stated that the person in the nude photo is not Rain and the company has since stated that it will take strict legal action against those who post photos together with false comments.en: Rain sues over allegedly fake nude pics; ko: ÎπÑ, ÏïåÎ™∏ÏÇ¨ÏßÑ ÎÖºÎûÄÏóê 'Î™ÖÏòàÌõºÏÜê ÎßûÎåÄÏùë' (english) (korean) In July 2018, Seoul police launched an investigation after a fake nude photo of President Moon Jae-in was posted on the website of the Korean radical feminist group WOMAD.The Korea Times, Police probe fake nude photo of President Moon on the radical feminist website In early 2019, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic politician, was berated by other political parties over a fake nude photo of her in the bathroom.

He had his secondary education at the Accra Academy and obtained his Law degree, LL.B (Hons) from the University of Ghana, Legon in 1981. He won a Ford Foundation Fellowship to study U.S. Foreign Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. His research paper was entitles; 'The Impact of the Print Media on U.S. Foreign Policy Somalia as a case study.'. Career Ben begun his professional career in journalism in 1974, whilst still a student at the Accra Academy. He started reporting for the London based monthly Africa Magazine. His reports on torture and other forms of human right abuse for the Africa Magazine did not go unnoticed by the then millitary government in power at the time, the National Redemption Council. Aside the possibility of his arrest, the concern of school authorities realising he was leaving the boarding house without permission to attend press conferences and conduct interviews was another threat he faced. His imminent arrest occurred while a student at the Accra Academy as he recalled how surprised they were to find out the Ben Ephson they expected to see was a teenage school boy rather than a grown man. He spent five months in cell without any visitors. Ben continued to pursue journalism even after receiving his law degree from the University of Ghana in 1981, the year the Limann government was overthrown by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). Around the period, he was reporting for the weekly West Africa (magazine). He was arrested once again, this time by the AFRC which had then evolved into Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC). At the time of his arrest, his wife was 8-months pregnant and he was released about 4 months after his son was born. He worked with the Africa Magazine from 1974 to 1984 and worked for the West Africa (magazine) from 1982 to 1996. He was the Ghanaian Correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) between 1986 and 1996 and the Ghanaian Correspondent for the Agence France-Presse (AFP) from 1996 to 2006. He also hosted Ephson 's File, a live radio talk show, on Radio Gold in the mid 1990s. He is currently the managing editor of the Daily Dispatch. Ben is widely regarded as a renowned and credible pollster in Ghana. He has credited his polling abilities to the principles of the U.S. election research opinion polling which he had the opportunity to learn while studying at the University of Maryland. Many of his predictions with regards to the presidential elections have been correct or very close and for this reason he is a very sought after pollster in the country. However, prior to the 2016 general election which resulted in a victory for the National Patriotic Party (NPP) he predicted John Mahama's National Democratic Congress (NDC) to poll 52.4 percent of the votes and Nana Akufo-Addo's National Patriotic Party (NPP) to poll 45.9 percent of the votes.

He was an expert on the treatment of spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Career Robert Zachary was born in 1913 in Pudsey to Samuel John Zachary, a dentist, and Priscilla Mary (n√©e Owen). He earned a Bachelor of Pharmacy in 1935 before completing a medical degree at the University of Leeds in 1940. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1943, originally working on orthopaedics at Oxford's Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. He changed specialties in 1945 to paediatric surgery and received a grant to train at Boston Children's Hospital. In 1947 he became a consultant paediatric surgeon at Sheffield Children's Hospital, making him the only consultant paediatric surgeon in Britain who had not been trained by Denis Browne at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He was the first full-time surgeon employed by Sheffield Children's Hospital. Zachary was an expert on neonatal surgery, and campaigned for all surgery on newborns to be done by specifically trained paediatric surgeons. He developed an international reputation for his expertise on surgical management of spina bifida and hydrocephalus, and founded the Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida. With paediatrician John Lorber and orthopaedic surgeon John Sharrard, Zachary showed that if babies with spina bifida were operated on within hours of birth, the survival rate could be improved from less than 10% to almost 90%. Zachary suffered from severe scoliosis and wrote of his connection with spina bifida patients: \\"In my own small way I feel a common bond with all those who have spina bifida when I say, 'We who were born with a deformed spine...'\\" Zachary was a founding member of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons and served as president in 1962‚Äì63. He received numerous awards and honorary appointments; these included a personal chair in paediatric surgery at Sheffield University, the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons' Denis Browne Gold Medal (1977), and Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. Later life In 1943 Zachary married Faith Alice Stewart, a theatre nurse whom he worked alongside at Leeds General Infirmary; she died from cancer in 1981. After retiring, he moved to Australia and married his second wife, Winifred. Following her death in 1990, he moved to Canada and married his third wife, Janetta. Zachary died in 1999 in Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland.

He once served as a friar from the Carmelites and did work in the missions in Kuwait though decided to return to his homeland to serve as a diocesan priest instead. He did his studies in Rome before his sacerdotal ordination in 1962; he began working in parishes where he became sensitive to the needs of workers and those suffering from gambling and drug addictions. He founded an institute for those people suffering from addictions and set up a range of courses and workshops to help addicts lead better and healthier lives. Boschetti's process for beatification opened in 2005 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated on 11 June 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged the fact that Boschetti had led a life of heroic virtue. Life Enzo Boschetti was born in Costa de' Nobili in the Pavia province on 19 November 1929 as the second of three children to the truck driver Silvio Boschetti and Esterina. In his adolescence he joined the Catholic Action in Pavia while attending some spiritual retreats gave rise to his call to enter into the religious life. He fled home after he turned 20 in late 1949 in order to join the Carmelites and then served as Fra Giuliano in his convent with his fellow friars (he decided to join the Carmelites at their convent in Monza after having read about Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux). He was later assigned to work in the missions in Kuwait in spring 1956 but there struggled with his call to the diocesan priesthood as opposed to the religious life. He decided instead to serve on the so-called frontlines of parish life rather than continuing to work in the missions. The challenge became that a religious could not opt for the diocesan priesthood which prompted Boschetti to leave the order in a move that surprised and baffled his superiors and peers. He received his sacerdotal ordination to the priesthood from the Bishop of Pavia Carlo Allorio on 29 June 1962 in the diocesan cathedral after having completed his theological formation in Rome. He was first assigned to serve as a pastor in Chignolo Po but in 1965 was reassigned to the Santissimo Salvatore parish. This church was located in the Ticinello neighbourhood which exposed Boschetti to the problems facing people such as drug and gambling addictions which he wished to help people recover from. His main focus was to prevent teenagers from falling into those said addictions. He founded the Casa del Giovane for those that suffered from gambling or drug addictions and he became a strong advocate for those suffering from addiction; he had also made the commitment to tend to adolescents who were beginning to exhibit gambling or drug-taking traits as he advocated for them to lead healthier lives free of addiction which would cause harm to themselves and those around them. He was noted for having walked around poor neighbourhoods in trousers and a blue or black sweater as opposed to his clerical cassock. This movement he founded had its origins in 1968 but began to gain traction in 1971 when he managed to attract others. In the 1980s he helped to establish a series of workshops to promote growth in the workplace and also set out to establish courses in schools. He often touted Saint Joseph as a guide and as a model when it came to the pastoral care of workers. In the 1980s he was hospitalized after suffering a nervous breakdown while in 1987 having an operation on his stomach. Boschetti died in a hospital in Esine from pancreatic cancer in 1993 after five consecutive months in which he had to undergo chemo treatment. The Bishop of Pavia Giovanni Volta celebrated the funeral Mass in the week of his death. Beatification process The beatification process commenced after the forum for the cause was transferred from the Brescia diocese (where Boschetti died) to the Pavia diocese on 17 March 2005. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints launched the cause on 16 May 2005 after titling Boschetti as a Servant of God and issuing the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict. The diocesan process was overseen in Pavia from 15 February 2006 until 16 February 2008 while the C.C.S. later validated that process on 7 May 2010. The C.C.S. received the official Positio dossier in 2014 for assessment while nine theologians voiced their assent to the cause sometime after. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishops agreed with their verdict and likewise issued their own approval at their meeting held on 4 June 2019. Boschetti became titled as Venerable on 11 June 2019 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life to an adequate degree. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini.

It had a population of 540 in 2016.  Toponymy  In the district Dudensen are the abandoned villages Holinbeke and Sesenhusen. Both are each named in a deed of donation, the former from 1033, the second 1186. Both deserts can be found with Seenser Feld and Hollenheide still in today's names. In her work on names of places in Neustadt am R√ºbenberge, Tanja Wei√ü uses two different names. Already in 1128 there is a documentary recorded Duotdenhusen. In a document from 1228 finally appears the name Dudenhusen. There are also two other secondary sources that indicate the year 1228 as the date of the first documentary mention of the place Dudensen under the name Dudenhusen. However, two other sources indicate the year 1261 for the first written mention. In contrast, however, the entry in the Hoyer Lehnsregister around the year 1250 that count Heinrich von Hoya in Dudenhusen two hooves as possession. Still in the year 1859 the place is officially listed as Duensen, as it still occurs in the linguistic usage.  Governance  Due to the territorial reform in 1974 Dudensen was a district of Neustadt a. Rbge. and since then forms with Borstel, Hagen and N√∂pke a village that is represented by a local council. The name of the borough has been M√ºhlenfelder Land since November 2011. The local council is made up of a councilwoman and ten councilors. The local council also has 17 advisory members.  Geography  Dudensen is about 12 km north of Neustadt's main part of the city. West of Dudensen in the western part of Dudenser bog is located the source of the creek called Alpe. The place belongs together with N√∂pke, Borstel and Hagen to M√ºhlenfelder Land.  Religion  St.-Ursula-Church In a decree of May 17, 1811, the district In den Meyerh√∂fen, which until then belonged to the parish Mandelsloh, was incorporated into Dudensen. In 1824 Dudensen is listed as a parish village, that means in the village a pastor had his seat. In 1871, 476 of the inhabitants, 475 were Protestant and one Catholic.

Northward migration by congregation members led to the synagogue relocating in 1994, to be replaced by the Great Park Synagogue on Glenhove Road, Oaklands, built on the model of the Great Synagogue, whose own architecture in turn was inspired by the Hagia Sophia. History The history of the Great Synagogue dates back to the beginning of Johannesburg, specifically to July 10, 1887, a year after the city's founding, when the Witwatersrand Goldfields Jewish Association was founded at a gathering in B. Wainstein's shop. The Association's original purposes included maintaining the Jewish cemetery and offering services to the Jewish pioneers of the city. On September 19, 1887, the first Rosh Hashanah service was held in the Rand Club, drawing a crowd of 500. Several months after the association's foundation, its name was changed to the Witwatersrand Hebrew Congregation, to better reflect its religious aims. In January 1888, the congregation purchased two plots of land on President Street to build a synagogue. On November 7 of that year, the Rev. Mark L. Harris of Kimberley laid the cornerstone and the work on Johannesburg's first synagogue officially began. In March 1890, daily services began in what would soon be called the President Street Synagogue. At the time, schisms were forming over several issues in the young congregation. Consequently, a number of members seceded to form the Johannesburg Hebrew Congregation. The Witwatersrand Hebrew Congregation renamed itself the Witwatersrand Old Hebrew Congregation. President Paul Kruger awarded four plots of land on the corner of Joubert and De Villiers Streets for the Johannesburg Hebrew Congregation to build its synagogue. Since the latter was near the original Johannesburg Park Station, this synagogue was known as the Park Station Synagogue or simply the Park Synagogue, and was opened with great pomp and circumstance by the President on September 14, 1892. The synagogue operated for 20 years and was purchased by the South African Railways and Harbours Administration in 1912, where it was serve as a military headquarters for the SARH regiment until it was demolished in 1928 to make way for a new station. After the Park Synagogue was sold, the Johannesburg Hebrew Congregation began building what would eventually become the largest Jewish house of worship in South Africa. Between 1913 and 1914, the Great Synagogue was built, covering an entire city block between Wolmarans, Claim, Quartz, and Smit Streets. The large site, chosen by the Jewish architect Hermann Kallenbach, was near the area where most of Johannesburg's Jews lived at the time. The building was designed by Theophile Schaerer, and the contractors were Hoheison & Co. Siegfried Raphaely laid the cornerstone on September 3, 1913. Sammy Marks provided all the bricks, and had the honor of handing over the key to the rabbi, Dr. Judah Leo Landau, at the inaugural ceremony. Construction took almost a year, and on August 23, 1914, the Johannesburg Hebrew Congregation officially opened its new synagogue under Rabbi Landau. The two congregations operated side by side for a total of 24 years, from 1891 to 1915, each with their own rabbi and congregation leaders. In 1898, the 26-year-old rabbi, Dr. Joseph Herman Hertz, was appointed to the Witwatersrand Old Hebrew Congregation. He would remain their spiritual guide until he left for America in 1911. In 1903, the Johannesburg Hebrew Congregation asked Dr. Landau to become their rabbi, which he remained until 1943. For 10 years, the two congregations tried without success to merge. Rabbi Hertz's departure in 1911 and the poor condition of the President Street Synagogue provided new motives for rapprochement, however. Finally, after protracted negotiations, an agreement was reached on May 30, 1915, forming the United Hebrew Congregation with its chief synagogue as the Wolmarans Street Synagogue. Since its dedication, Chief Rabbis of South Africa would continue to be based there, including Dr. Landau and Rabbis Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, Bernard M. Casper, and Cyril Harris.

He showed promise as a two-year-old in 2015 when he won two of his five starts. In the following year he recorded his first important victory in the Grade 3 Arlington Cup and went on to finish third in the NHK Mile Cup and second in the Kikuka Sho. He failed to win in 2017 but ran well in several major races. He reached his peak in the spring of 2018 when he won the Hanshin Daishoten and the spring edition of the Tenno Sho but sustained a career- ending injury in the latter race. He was a \\"hold-up\\" horse who was typically restrained at the rear of the field before unleashing a late run. Background Rainbow Line is a bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in Japan by Northern Farm. As a yearling in 2014 the colt was consigned to the JRA Select Sale and was bought for ¬•54,000,000 by Sanseisha Co. He entered the ownership of Masahiro Mita and was sent into training with Hidekazu Asami. Rainbow Line usually raced in blinkers. His sire, Stay Gold, a son of the thirteen-time Leading sire in Japan Sunday Silence, was a successful international performer, winning the Dubai Sheema Classic and the Hong Kong Vase. Standing at stud at the Big Red Farm in Hokkaido, he produced numerous important winners including Gold Ship, Orfevre, and Nakayama Festa. Rainbow Line's dam Regenbogen showed modest racing one minor race from four starts as a three-year-old in 2005. She proved a successful broodmare whose other foals Animate Bio who won the Rose Stakes and finished second in the Shuka Sho. Regenbogen was a great-granddaughter of the imported French-bred mare Petite Amie, who was in turn a female-line descendant of the British mare Jury, making her distantly related to many good winners including Roland Gardens and Kooyonga. Racing career =2015: three-year-old season= Rainbow Line began his racing career by running second in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Sapporo Racecourse on 2 August 2015. After finishing runner up over the same course and distance two weeks later he opened his winning account in a maiden race (again over 1800 metres at Sapporo) on 30 August as he won from Tizona and seven others. After a two-month break the colt was stepped up in class for the Listed Hagi Stakes at Kyoto Racecourse and finished third behind Black Spinel and Smart Odin. Despite he was promoted again to contest the Grade 3 Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes at Tokyo Racecourse on 23 November in which he started a 36/1 outsider and came home ninth of the eleven runners behind Smart Odin. On his final start of the year Rainbow Line was dropped back in distance for the Sanryo Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 27 December and won narrowly from Sunrise Couronne. =2016: three-year-old season= Rainbow Line's trainer Hidekazu Asami Two weeks after his last start of 2015, Rainbow Line began his second campaign in the Shinzan Kinen at Kyoto and finished sixth of the eighteen runners behind Logi Cry. On 27 February at Hanshin the colt contested the Grade 3 Arlington Cup over 1600 metres on firm ground and started the 5.8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Urban Kid, Ball Lightning (Keio Hai Nisai Stakes) and Hiruno Magellan. Ridden by Mirco Demuro he raced towards the rear of the field before moving up on the wide outside on the final turn and staying on strongly in the straight. In a \\"blanket finish\\" which saw the first five finishers separated by less than a half a length he prevailed by a nose from Dantsu Prius. The Grade 2 New Zealand Trophy at Nakayama Racecourse on 9 April saw another very tight finish and Rainbow Line was beaten less than a length as he finished fifth behind Dantsu Prius. On 8 May the colt was stepped up to Grade 1 class for the first time to contest the NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo and started a 40/1 outsider. Ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga he exceeded expectations as he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish a close third behind Major Emblem and Lord Quest. He was then moved up in distance for the Tokyo Yushun three weeks later in which he started at odds of 154/1 and came home eighth of the eighteen runners behind Makahiki. After a break of two and a half months Rainbow Line returned to the track in August when he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Grade 2 Sapporo Kinen. With Fukunaga in the saddle he came from the rear of the field with a strong late run to take third place behind the five-year-olds Neorealism and Maurice. In October the colt was moved up again in trip for the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto and started a 23.9/1 outsider in an eighteen-runner field. After racing towards the rear for most of the way he produced an \\"impressive late charge\\" to take second place behind Satono Diamond with Air Spinel and Dee Majesty finishing close behind in third and fourth. On his final run of the season in the Japan Cup on 27 October Rainbow Line produced his customary late run from the rear of the field to come home sixth of the seventeen starters, four lengths behind the winner Kitasan Black. In the 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Rainbow Line was given a rating of 116, making him the 158th best racehorse in the world. =2017: four-year-old season= Rainbow Line began his third season by running fourth behind Sciacchetra in the Nikkei Sho over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 25 March. Five weeks later he ran poorly in the spring edition of the Tenno Sho over 3200 metres at Kyoto as he finished twelfth of the seventeen runners behind Kitasan Black. After this race Yasunari Iwata took over the ride and partnered the horse in all of his subsequent starts. In the Takarazuka Kinen in June the colt produced a better effort as he came home fifth of the eleven runners behind Satono Crown. After a break of more than five months Rainbow Line returned in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho in which he started a 58.6/1 outsider and produced a strong late run to take third place behind Kitasan Black and Satono Crown. IN November the colt contested his second Japan Cup and repeated his 2017 result as he finished sixth behind Cheval Grand having turned into the straight last of the seventeen runners. He ended the year by running eighth behind Kitasan Black in the Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 24 December. In the 2017 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Rainbow Line was given a rating of 118, making him the 90th best racehorse in the world. =2018: five-year-old season= Yasunari Iwata, who rode Rainbow Line in his last six races On 18 March 2018 Rainbow Line began his fourth campaign in the Hanshin Daishoten over 3000 metres. He started the 4.6/1 third choice in the betting behind Clincher (Kyoto Kinen) and Albert (Stayers Stakes) in an eleven-runner field which also included Satono Chronicle (Challenge Cup) and Curren Mirotic (Kinko Sho). After being restrained towards the rear as usual, Rainbow Line moved up on the outside on the final turn, hit the front approaching the last 200 metres and recorded his first win for more than two years as he came home a length and a quarter in front of Satono Chronicle with Clincher in third place. At Kyoto six weeks later Rainbow Line made his second attempt to win the spring edition of the Tenno Sho and was made the 5/1 second favourite behind Cheval Grand. Clincher, Satono Chronicle, Albert and Curren Mirotic were again in opposition while the other eleven contenders included Ganko (Nikkei Sho), Chestnut Coat, Tosen Basil, Mikki Rocket (Nikkei Shinshun Hai) and Smart Layer (Hanshin Himba Stakes). The outsider Yamakatsu Raiden set the early pace with Rainbow Line settled well back in the field. Cheval Grand gained the advantage in the straight but Rainbow Line threaded his way through field after being switched to the inside by Iwata, caught the favourite in the final strides and won by a neck. Immediately after the race the horse was found to be lame, having sustained an injury to his right foreleg and was taken receive treatment at a veterinary facility rather than taking part in the victory ceremony. Iwata said \\"While our rivals were making early moves in the backstretch, my mount waited patiently, and I knew he had the needed late kick to reach the front before the wire. I'm worried about the horse. I just hope he‚Äôll be able to run in the next race\\" while Hidekazu Asami commented \\"It's great that he was able to win but I'm concerned about his condition. I hope to give him the best care as possible\\". Rainbow Line was unable to return to the track following his injury and was retired from racing at the end of the year. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Rainbow Line was again given a rating of 118, making him 78th best horse in the world. Stud record Rainbow Line began his stud career at the Yushun Stallion Station in 2019.

It consisted of first through tenth grades and enrolled between 75 and 150 students on a campus that consisted initially of only a two-story schoolhouse. It was created largely due to the underfunded and generally inadequate public schools in the city. Arlington College closed in July 1902, after Arlington voters passed a proposition to create an independent school district. Carlisle Military Academy was established on the same site by Colonel James M. Carlisle in 1902. Although nominally a school for boys, it also accepted a handful of female students. Its enrollment grew from 48 students in 1902 to 150 students by 1905. Pupils were between the ages of 10 and 18. The school was molded by Carlisle's educational philosophy, which balanced intellectualism with military training to instill discipline in students and prepare them for enrollment in elite colleges. In 1907, United States Army lieutenant Harry King visited the school and became convinced it was one of the best institutions of its kind in the country. Carlisle's financial problems resulted in the school entering receivership in 1911, and in 1913 the school closed Later in 1913, Arlington Training School was founded by H. K. Taylor, and like its immediate predecessor it focused on offering a preparatory military school education for male students, although it also accepted female students. Its enrollment grew from 32 students on its opening day to 93 students in its final academic year, 1915‚Äì16. Graduates of its secondary unit met the University of Texas at Austin's entrance requirements. The school was beset by financial troubles and lawsuits in the spring of 1916. Taylor left Arlington after the end of the 1915‚Äì16 academic year and Arlington Training School closed. In 1916, Arlington Military Academy was founded by John B. Dodson, and it lasted for only one academic year. It would be the last attempt by the citizens of Arlington to support a private intermediate and secondary school. Like its predecessors, the school attempted to balance intellectualism with military exercises, instill discipline into its students, and prepare them for attending a university or a career in business. However, its enrollment figures were disappointing, resulting in little community support for the school. In January 1917, Arlington leaders met to organize an effort to convince the Texas Legislature to grant the community a junior college in place of a military academy. Despite their failures, between 1895 and 1917 these four private schools had collectively educated hundreds of children in Arlington.  Arlington College (1895‚Äì1902)  The first building on the campus of Arlington College under construction Arlington College was founded in September 1895 by Lee M. Hammond and William M. Trimble. At the time, Arlington was a small rural North Texas town with a population of about 1,000 people. Its public schools were underfunded and generally inadequate, an important problem given the median age in Arlington was 20 and a third of its residents were under age 10. Arlington College was the first of a series of private schools to exist on the site of the present University of Texas at Arlington. From the beginning it was championed by civic booster Emmett Rankin, a native of Tennessee who moved to Arlington in 1874 and established the Rankin Hardware Company. He hoped to raise the standard of education in the then-rural town. A private school, Arlington College consisted of first through tenth grades, with students spanning approximately from first grade through tenth grade. The school charged tuition that ranged between $1.50 and $3.50 per month per student. It had a faculty of six teachers and taught subjects ranging from algebra, grammar, and Latin to art, elocution, and penmanship. In 1895‚Äì96, the school's inaugural year, it had about 75 students, which grew to approximately 120 in 1896‚Äì97 and 150 in 1897‚Äì98. It held its first commencement in May 1898, which graduated only two students at the high school level. In May 1900, four students graduated. Arlington College's original wood-frame schoolhouse stood near the location of the University Center on the UTA campus today, on land donated by James Ditto and A. W. Collins that was at the time southwest of Arlington. Built at a cost of $5,000, the two-story schoolhouse lacked indoor plumbing but contained six classrooms and an assembly room. Rankin convinced Lee Morgan Hammond and William M. Trimble, the two co-principals of the Arlington Public School, to start Arlington College and invest $500 each in it. Hammond had been born in Alabama in 1869 and Trimble had been born in Tarrant County, Texas, in 1868. Both were educated at Bedford College and Sam Houston Normal Institute before they arrived in Arlington to become co-principals of the Arlington Public School in 1894. Arlington College stock certificate, 1900 During the 1896‚Äì97 academic year, Arlington College agreed to provide places for public school students for a duration of five months in exchange for receiving two-thirds of Arlington's public education funding, an agreement that lasted until 1900. Perhaps because of the unsatisfactory nature of this agreement, Trimble sold his interest in Arlington College in 1898 and Hammond did likewise in 1900. That year, the Arlington College Corporation was established to run the school, with newly appointed president W. W. Franklin of Dallas. The new corporation and its trustees sold stock in an effort to prevent the closure of the school. In July 1900, Arlington College filed a charter for $4,000 in capital stock. In 1901, its faculty consisted of four teachers. In the summer of that year, the school's trustees declared Arlington College's building to be \\"unsafe and wholly unfit\\" before a proposition to transfer the school's administration from the trustees to the city was defeated by Arlington voters. In August 1901, the college and the city came to an agreement by which the public school would rent the Arlington College building for $350, while the college retained just one room and one teacher. Throughout the 1901‚Äì02 academic year, the local newspaper, The Arlington Journal, pressured for school reform and the creation of an independent school district that would have the means to construct a new brick building. In April 1902, Arlington voters passed a proposition to create an independent school district (which officially became the Arlington Independent School District with legislative validation a year later) by a margin of three-to-one, while later that spring they also approved a $12,000 bond issue to fund school construction. Arlington College officially closed on July 3, 1902, when the corporation deeded its property. At the same time, it was announced that James M. Carlisle had agreed to establish a military academy on the grounds of the college in fall 1902. Also in 1902, Arlington Journal editor William A. Bowen began a campaign to create a junior college in Arlington that as a branch campus of Texas A&M; College, an effort he continued for 15 years until such a college was established in the city. Bowen's ideas were supported by editorials in the Dallas Times Herald, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and the Houston Post. While some called for a simple expansion of the campus in College Station to accommodate A&M;'s growth, ultimately branch campuses around Texas were established in addition to an enlarged College Station campus.  Military training schools (1902‚Äì1917)  = Carlisle Military Academy (1902‚Äì1913) = Drawing of the Carlisle Military Academy campus in 1901 Carlisle Military Academy was established by Colonel James M. Carlisle in September 1902. Carlisle was born in Coffee County, Tennessee, and was educated at Beech Grove College in Tennessee; Emory College in Oxford, Georgia; and the University of Nashville. When he arrived in Arlington in 1902, he had a reputation as a prominent educator; he had already served as state superintendent of public instruction, the president of the Texas State Teachers Association, the superintendent of public schools in three different cities (Corsicana, Fort Worth, and Whitesboro), and was the founder of private schools in both Hillsboro and Whitesboro. Before he opened a new school in Arlington, Carlisle received a tentative deed for the school's land and a promise by the town's citizens to build a dormitory on that land. Carlisle Military Academy students Jessie (Bardin) Wardell, Ethel (Roy) Brown, and Eunice Taylor in 1910 Carlisle's new school, a private military academy, opened on September 16, 1902. It was initially known as Carlisle's School for Boys despite the fact that it accepted girls as well. After being incorporated in fall 1903 as Carlisle Military Academy, it secured a charter from the State of Texas that declaring it to be \\"for the literary, military, and manual training of boys\\". However, the charter also expressly allowed Carlisle to enroll \\"a limited number of girls\\". The dormitory promised by Arlingtonians was known officially as Arlington Hall but commonly as the South Barracks. It housed 30 students, a dining hall, and the superintendent's residence on a site where Preston Hall would later be built. Carlisle himself served as the school's superintendent, while his wife Julia, his daughter Mary, and Rev. W. B. Fitzhugh served as its three directors. Both Julia and Mary Carlisle also taught classes. The school maintained at least four full-time teachers on staff throughout its history, although most individual teachers left the school after only a year or two on staff. On opening day in September 1902, 48 students were enrolled in Carlisle Military Academy, and by the end of the academic year in May 1903, that number had grown to 71. Nearly two thirds of students were local, either living at home or with relatives in Arlington while they attended the school. Most of the other students were from Central Texas and North Texas. In the spring of 1904, the school had 97 students, and in spring 1905, it had 150. The school graduated two students at its first commencement ceremony in May 1904, its lowest-ever number of graduates. Its highest number of graduates was 11, in 1909. In September 1905, due in part to the school's struggles to handle increases in enrollment, it stopped accepting female students and reduced its advertising. As a result, two former teachers, Mary Carlisle and Maggie Smith, established a separate Carlisle-Smith School for Girls in 1904. This school taught girls in first through tenth grades in Arlington, although it only lasted for two years. Carlisle Military Academy was guided by Carlisle's educational philosophy, which balanced intellectualism with military training to instill discipline in students and prepare them for enrollment in elite colleges. The school accepted students between the ages of 10 and 18, and had grades that were roughly equivalent to fifth through tenth grades. The first two years of study were considered preparatory, and the latter four years roughly equivalent to high school. The curriculum was composed of both required courses such as English, geography, and mathematics as well as electives such as Latin, modern languages, and shorthand. Classes in military science were also offered, while military drill for all male students occurred on a daily basis. Students were additionally required to wear their cadet uniforms at all times. Tuition at Carlisle Military Academy was initially $245, but later increased to $300, while uniforms cost $30.05. An application fee of $25 was instituted in fall 1906. Carlisle required parents to give the school \\"complete authority\\" over their children while they attended, while also prohibiting tobacco and advertising Arlington as a \\"Christian community\\" without saloons. With growth in enrollment at Carlisle Military Academy came the acquisition of more land and construction of more buildings, starting with the East Barracks in fall 1904, which had 16 rooms that each boasted electric lighting and indoor plumbing. By summer 1905, all of the school's buildings featured indoor plumbing. By 1906, the school had expanded to four blocks in size, and by 1911 it had constructed an athletics track, additional barracks, a gymnasium, and an indoor swimming pool. The campus eventually spanned . Carlisle Military Academy's first football team, circa 1906‚Äì1907 Carlisle Military Academy offered a wide variety of extracurricular activities for its students. It sponsored lectures, plays, music recitals, band concerts, and socials, all of which were open to the Arlington community. It also organized military units that participated in drills, parades, and even mock battles. Between 1904 and 1908, it began fielding athletics teams that played baseball, basketball, football, and track, which brought particular acclaim to the school‚Äì13. The football program was suspended in 1908 after the parents of four starting players removed their sons from the team for fear of injury, leaving the squad with too few players to contest games. Furthermore, the football and baseball coach was, along with six students, arrested for fighting in January 1909. The school also had a cadet band, which was directed by Captain H. E. Alden, who had previously conducted military and civil bands in New York and Ohio. Carlisle Military Academy baseball team, 1910‚Äì1911 Carlisle attempted to align the school more strongly with other military academies, and in March 1907 United States Army lieutenant Harry King visited the school and became convinced that Carlisle Military Academy was one of the best institutions of its kind in the country. In summer 1907, after inspecting the school, the United States Department of War assigned an active-duty officer, lieutenant Kelton L. Pepper, to the academy. He served as an instructor of military science and made the school only the second military academy in the Southwestern United States to have an active-duty officer on its staff. In 1908, the school was one of only three military academies operating in Texas, with the other two both located in San Antonio. Carlisle Military Academy began to encounter serious problems in October 1905, when a fire destroyed a barracks that was uninsured. In fall 1908, enrollment fell to 88, the least since its first year, due in part to the Panic of 1907 as well as a local drought. In an effort to raise revenue, Carlisle again allowed female students to enroll in 1908 and converted the academy's real estate (four city blocks in all) to capital stock. Despite these efforts to raise revenue, Carlisle realized that the only effective long-term solution would be to increase enrollment. In May 1911, after rumors that Carlisle was considering leaving town to create a new school elsewhere, his financial problems resulted in the school entering receivership. During receivership, General R. H. Beckham, who was appointed the receiver by the county's district court, settled suits with the school's creditors after Carlisle was unable to meet his obligations to them. Beckham also managed the school's affairs, ensured all its buildings had fire insurance, compiled lists of all its property and liabilities, and continued to employ teachers and staff while, so long as possible, paying them with cash on hand. In October 1911, the school's lienholders, many of whom had been on its advisory board since 1907, filed suit against Carlisle Military Academy to force it to sell its property after becoming convinced the school could not operate efficiently. They were concerned that the land would be sold and developed for purposes other than education. After operating for two more years, in August 1913 Carlisle Military Academy was ordered by the court to sell its property to satisfy its obligations with the bank and its lienholders. At this point, the school's debt to its mortgage holders was in excess of $20,000. When bank officer Thomas Spruance purchased its land for $15,610 in a public sale, the school was ordered to pay off as much of the deficit as possible by selling its other property. The court also ordered the school to pay its other debts as well as court costs, and ruled that the Carlisle Military Academy Corporation be dissolved and its \\"worthless\\" records be destroyed. According to historian Gerald Saxon, Carlisle was \\"a popular and capable educator, but a flawed administrator.\\" Authors Evelyn Barker and Lea Worcester similarly described him as \\"an excellent educator but a terrible financial manager.\\" Suffering from inefficient management, the school was hurt by its increasing debts, declining enrollments, and overly optimistic plans for expansion. In 1913, Carlisle left Arlington \\"a humbled and dejected man\\". He moved to Whitewright to open a new school with his wife, albeit it only lasted for a year. While he was ultimately unable to maintain the school in Arlington, Carlisle did significantly improve its buildings, curriculum, and reputation, which resulted in high hopes for its successor institutions. Carlisle Military Academy had been well regarded in North Texas, and The Whitewright Sun described it as noted for its \\"development of boys into strong men\\". = Arlington Training School (1913‚Äì1916) = Gymnasium and pool on the Arlington Training School campus, 1913 Arlington Training School was founded by Henry Kirby Taylor in September 1913, and like its immediate predecessor it focused on offering a preparatory military school education for male students. Taylor was born in Vanceburg, Kentucky, was educated at Kentucky Wesleyan College, and served as president or superintendent of multiple schools in Kentucky between 1883 and 1909. He served as president of Northwest State Teachers College in Maryville, Missouri, from 1909 to 1913, where he earned a reputation as a capable administrator. He left Missouri for Arlington in 1913. Taylor's son-in-law, J. J. Godbey, had served as the headmaster of Carlisle Military Academy from 1911 to 1913, and he helped convince Taylor to move to Arlington and start a new military academy in the town. After arriving in Texas, Taylor reached an agreement with Carlisle Military Academy's property owners in which he promised to improve and insure the campus's buildings, organize an advertising campaign, and employ a competent staff in exchange for being allowed to keep any profits generated and having the opportunity to purchase the school and its land outright for $18,000. Arlington Training School opened on the former site of Carlisle Military Academy on September 10, 1913. Due in part to a local drought, only 32 students were enrolled at its opening. On opening day, it also had a staff of seven, most of whom were relatives of Taylor: two were sons-in-law, two were daughters, and one was his wife. By the end of the 1913‚Äì14 academic year, enrollment had risen to 66 students. In 1914‚Äì15, 95 students attended the school, while during the 1915‚Äì16 school year, there were 93 students. In spring 1914, the school graduated three students at its first commencement ceremony. In May 1915, 10 students graduated. Like its immediate predecessor, Arlington Training School admitted girls as day students. It offered both academic courses and additional music classes for its female students. The school billed itself as offering military-style education with \\"thorough and practical courses\\". Conceiving itself as a place for \\"gentlemen's sons\\" and not a reformatory for \\"vicious boys\\", again similar in this regard to its predecessor, Arlington Training School emphasized developing students to be hardworking, polite, and respectful. It also required them to attend church services and Sunday school and spend an hour writing to their families on Sundays. Taylor also advertised Arlington as having \\"no saloons or other immoral influences.\\" Arlington Training School was organized into two separate units: an intermediate unit consisting of grades four through six, and a secondary unit with grades seven through ten. To graduate, a student had to complete seventeen \\"units of work\\" at the secondary level, which met the University of Texas at Austin's entrance requirements. At the secondary level, the school offered a comprehensive curriculum with courses in mathematics, history, the sciences, English, and foreign languages, as well as vocational subjects such as agriculture, bookkeeping, and business law. Band and physical education were also offered. In 1913‚Äì14, board and tuition for students under 14 was $250, and for students over 14 it was $300. Children of ministers received a 15% discount on tuition. Arlington Training School band, 1913 Taylor organized a number of extracurricular activities for students during the 1913‚Äì14 school year, including a band, a school newspaper, and numerous athletics teams: baseball, basketball, football, and track for boys, and basketball for girls. During the 1914‚Äì15 school year, forensic clubs, literary societies, and musical groups were added to the offerings, as was tennis, which was offered for both boys and girls. During the 1913‚Äì14 school year, Taylor held meetings with the community to address the school's financial health, which resulted in the sale of 60 scholarships to town residents, the organization of a \\"Busy Men's Forum\\" by meeting attendees, and the creation of a board of advisors. Encouraged by this support, Taylor made plans to hire new faculty members and improve the school's buildings and grounds for the next year. Aside from the construction of a grandstand, none of these planned improvements were made during the 1914‚Äì15 academic year. The Arlington Journal reported that this failure was a result of the \\"difference of opinion regarding the value of the property\\" between Taylor and the advisory board, which was only the first disagreement between the two. At the time, the disagreement appeared to be minor and short- lived. Taylor, in a letter to the local newspaper, revealed his further plans to improve the campus's buildings and even transform the school into a junior college that would offer courses in agriculture, home economics, and manual training, as well as host an experimental farm and demonstration service. The plan was supported by the director of the Texas A&M; College extension department, Clarence Owsley, and the Tarrant County farm demonstrator, G. W. Eudaly. The proposal called for issuing $30,000 in stock to purchase the land and buildings on the Arlington Training School campus. In July 1915, the school incorporated with $15,000 in capital stock, and emboldened by the development, Taylor began a significant program of building construction that summer and fall. In total, $10,000 was spent to build a new two-story frame building that housed a library, science laboratories, a business office, and literary society accommodations, while also repairing almost all other buildings on campus. In spring 1916, financial troubles and lawsuits once again impacted the school, as Taylor accused the secretary-treasurer and other members of the board of directors of using most of the $10,000 allocated for repairing the campus's buildings for their own personal uses. In March of that year, Taylor informed stockholders that he would not lease the school after the 1915‚Äì16 academic year ended in May, breaking a contract he signed in summer 1915 in which he had agreed to lease the school's property for five years. The board then sued Taylor in district court, which ruled against him in February 1917. By the time of the verdict, however, Taylor had already left Arlington to work as an extension agent at Texas Woman's College in Denton. = Arlington Military Academy (1916‚Äì1917) = Arlington Military Academy was founded by John B. Dodson in 1916 and was only open for one academic year. Dodson was born in Tennessee in 1861 and educated at Carson-Newman College. Before moving to Arlington he had served as superintendent of schools in both Oak Cliff and McKinney, as president of Oak Cliff College, and as head of the University Military School for Boys in Dallas. Like its predecessors, the school attempted to balance intellectualism with military exercises, instill discipline into its students, and prepare them for attending a university or a career in business. It was also open to both male and female students, and once again had an advisory board composed of many leading Arlington citizens. The Arlington Military Academy also fielded a football team, as its predecessors had. After closing in 1917, there were no further attempts by the citizens of Arlington to support a private intermediate and secondary school. Arlington Military Academy had a disappointing enrollment, although the exact number of students enrolled is unknown. Little else is known about the school other than that it suffered from a lack of community support. Instead of trying to save it, in January 1917 Arlington leaders met to organize an effort to convince the Texas Legislature to grant the community a junior college in place of a military academy. In the end, the Arlington community was neither willing nor able to provide the necessary support for operating a private school in the community. Despite their failures, these private schools had collectively educated hundreds of children over a period of 22 years.

He was a member of the influential Joly de Fleury family. Family He was the son of , of the Parlement of Paris and of Marie Francoise Le Maistre. His brothers were Guillaume-Fran√ßois-Louis Joly de Fleury (1710-1787) who succeeded their father in his post as Procurator General, and Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury who may best be known for his unjust prosecution of Lally Tollendal on charges of treason. Finance Minister Fleury's predecessor was Jacques Necker, the Swiss wunderkind who was brought into the French ministry at a time of great debt in 1777. By the time Necker left in 1781, two things had occurred that exacerbated the crisis growing in the coffers of King Louis XVI of France. First, Necker had published the Compte rendu au roi, a \\"full\\" accounting of the King's finances--which showed that the King's budget was strong given the \\"ordinary\\" expenses. What this document failed to show were the \\"extraordinary\\" expenses--including massive debts to pay for the American Revolutionary War. This type of publication was previously unheard of in an absolute monarchy and was extremely popular with the people. The second problem was that Necker had seen the addition of massive debts on behalf of the British colonies to pay for their revolutionary war. These debts were so deep that Necker was having trouble paying the interest on them in addition to all the other expenses for which he had to account. So when Fleury took over in 1781, he saw the full and complete version of the books and made several decisions that were unpopular. To correct the problems, he took three steps to stop the financial bleeding: * he reestablished the practice of selling venal office to raise emergency funds, a procedure that was eliminated in the previous decade to improve the long-term financial stability of the Monarchy * he worked with his friends and personal connections in multiple French Parlement to push through an emergency tax on the nobility * he drastically cut the \\"gifts\\" the king was giving to his courtiers, which made him unpopular at court Because his predecessor had published a book that was an incomplete version of the King's finances, Fleury had a difficult time making his case because members of government would simply point to their copy of the Compte rendu and decry him a liar. Given the unpopularity of his taxes among the wealthy of France and his angering of the King's personal courtiers, eventually Fleury was forced to resign his position in 1783. He was replaced by Charles Alexandre de Calonne.  Legacy  Though a minor figure, Fleury was one in a series of ministers who acted as a stepping stone toward the French Revolution. His taxes and curtailing of gifts were both rescinded immediately after his departure, but the selling of venal offices continued -- trading short-term bandages for long-term solutions to the Monarchy's debt crises.

It is found in most of Europe except the UK, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States and Scandinavia (although it is found in Denmark), and in Turkey. It is also missing in northwestern France and southern Italy. Description The plain green leaves of A. cylindraceum appear in early spring (late March‚Äìearly May) followed by the flowers borne on a poker-shaped inflorescence called a spadix, which is partially enclosed in a grass-green spathe or leaf-like hood. The flowers are hidden from sight, clustered at the base of the spadix with a ring of female flowers at the bottom and a ring of male flowers above them. Above the male flowers is a ring of hairs forming an insect trap. Insects are attracted to the spadix by its faecal odour and a temperature warmer than the ambient temperature. The insects are trapped beneath the ring of hairs and are dusted with pollen by the male flowers before escaping and carrying the pollen to the spadices of other plants, where they pollinate the female flowers. The spadix is pale chocolate brown to dark purple. pp. 85-90 Image:Arum cylindraceum7.jpg Image:Arum cylindraceum sl2.jpg Image:Arum cylindraceum3.JPG Image:Arum cylindraceum sl1.jpg In autumn, the lower ring of (female) flowers forms a cluster of bright red berries which remain after the spathe and other leaves have withered away. These attractive red to orange berries are extremely poisonous. The berries contain oxalates of saponins which have needle-shaped crystals which irritate the skin, mouth, tongue, and throat, and result in swelling of the throat, difficulty breathing, burning pain, and upset stomach. However, their acrid taste, coupled with the almost immediate tingling sensation in the mouth when consumed, means that large amounts are rarely taken and serious harm is unusual. All parts of the plant can produce allergic reactions in many people and the plant should be handled with care. Many small rodents appear to find the spadix particularly attractive; finding examples of the plant with much of the spadix eaten away is common. The spadix produces heat and probably scent as the flowers mature, and this may attract the rodents. In areas where both A. cylindraceum and A. maculatum are found, they are easily confused. A. cylindraceum, however, does not usually occur in the wild in the UK, but in Central Europe both species are found, often growing in the same locations. The only characteristic that sets the two species apart with certainty all year is the tuber, which is horizontal with A. maculatum but vertical with A. cylindraceum.https://www.fugleognatur.dk/forum/show_message.asp?page=1&MessageID;=178132&ForumID;=12 Other differences are: * The spadix is around 2/3 as long as the spathe; with A. maculatum it is only 1/2 as long. The spadix of A. cylindraceum is never yellow, which it can be with A. maculatum. * A. cylindraceum never has spotted leaves (except when hybridizing with A. maculatum). Note that A. maculatum, despite the name, does not always have spotted leaves (e.g. A. maculatum ssp. immaculatum). * The cluster of berries is up to 7 cm with A. cylindraceum, and up to 4 cm with A. maculatum. * The spathe is greener with A. cylindraceum, not quite as pale as with A. maculatum. Habitat Throughout the area it is found in deciduous woodland or on the edges of coniferous woodland, preferring partly shade and somewhat moist conditions. It is found up to 1700m, lower in the northern part of the area. In the southern part it is also found on grassy or rocky slopes and pastures. Taxonomy Within the genus, it belongs to subgenus Arum, section Alpina. A. cylindraceum has a chromosome count of 2n = 28. A. alpinum is now considered a synonym of A. cylindraceum, but certain subspecies such as A. alpinum ssp. danicum were long held to be a representative of another species. The name A. alpinum is, however, now considered obsolete in all cases. Uses In medieval Denmark, then including parts of Germany and Sweden, starch from the tubers (also from A. maculatum) was used to stiffen clerical collars, but as the tubers contain a caustic sap that caused blistering of the hands, this was abandoned when starch from wheat became available. Today colonies of A. cylindraceum are still found close to church sites, although the species seems to have died out in southern Sweden.

He has been a member of the Canadian national team since 2017. He is coached by Adrian Balan. Dolci trains 30 hours a week while managing his time with high school in Montr√©al.  Early life  Dolci was born in Saint-Eustache, Qu√©bec in 2002. He started gymnastics at the age of 6 at Laval Excellence, a gym in Laval, Qu√©bec. His first competition was in 2009 and, up to this day, has won over 200 medals and awards, including sports merits and other honors. His mother suggested he try gymnastics, mainly as a way to release his energy as sports such as hockey and soccer failed to adequately do that. Dolci speaks both French and English as he resides in the province of Qu√©bec.  Junior Career  = 2018 = Dolci during the still rings apparatus final at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics where he was winning the silver medal. Dolci suffered a shoulder injury at the start of 2018 which made it difficult to do high bar, pommel horse, and parallel bars. Because of this, he was not able to compete his best at the √âlite Canada competition in February and ended up in fourth place in the all-around. Dolci recovered and in April he went to the Pacific Rim Championships in Medellin, Colombia. He placed 2nd as a team, 2nd on rings, 4th on parallel bars, and 8th on high bar. He then moved on to the Canadian Championships held in Waterloo, Ontario and placed 1st on all-around, floor, vault, and high bar; 2nd on rings; 3rd on parallel bars; and 4th on pommel horse. Dolci's second international competition of the year came in June at the Junior Pan American Gymnastics Championships in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he won gold on rings and bronze in all-around, floor, high bar, and as a team. In October, Dolci was back in Buenos Aires for the Youth Olympic Games. He placed 2nd on rings, 6th on floor, 7th on vault, 8th on high bar, and 9th in the all-around. His silver made him the first Canadian gymnast to win a medal at the Youth Olympics. He rounded out the year with the Austrian Future Cup in Linz, Austria in November . He dominated the competition, placing first on every event (including team and all-around) except high bar, where he received the bronze medal.

Competing in the junior competition, he won gold in all-around, high bar, vault, and floor; silver on rings and as the Qu√©bec team; and finished in 8th on pommel horse. This achievement made him the most decorated athlete in the Canada Games for a single year. Dolci then went to University of Calgary International Cup (UCIC) in Calgary, Alberta in March. He placed 1st on pommel horse, rings, and parallel bars, and got 6th on high bar. In May, he went to the Canadian Championships in Ottawa, Ontario. There he received the gold medal in all events excluding vault and pommel horse where he placed 2nd and 4th, respectively. Dolci during the floor exercise apparatus final at the 2019 Junior World Artistic Gymnastics Championships  Junior World Gymnastics Championships  At the end of June, Dolci went to Gy≈ër, Hungary to compete in the 1st Junior World Gymnastics Championships. The first day of competition was the qualification for the event finals, team final, and all-around final in one.. Along with Ioannis Chronopoulos and Evgeny Siminiuc, Dolci helped Canada place fifth as a team with a combined total of 158.563, just over 0.6 behind 3rd place Italy. Since only the top 2 scores on each event counted, so Dolci contributed on every event except pommel horse. His all-around score was not quite enough though, as he received a 79.731 which was around 0.5 behind the bronze medalist, Ukraine's Illia Kovtun. Dolci qualified for 2 event finals: floor (in third) and rings (in second). He also qualified in first on vault with a score of 14.533, but only competed one vault so he wasn't part of the final as you have to perform 2 separate vaults to qualify. Dolci finished 2nd in the floor final with a 14.000, only 0.166 behind South Korea's Ryu Sung-hyun. In the same day, he went on to the rings final with a 13.600, winning the event by 0.1 ahead of silver medalist Diogo Soares of Brazil. In both of the finals that Dolci was part of, he had the highest execution scores out of all of the 8 gymnasts part of the final.

Seeker's propulsion system is controlled by a custom, FPGA-based board and power is provided to the system from GomSpace NanoPower BP4 batteries. Propulsion The Seeker vehicle contained a small 6 ‚Äì Degree of Freedom, cold gas nitrogen based cubesat propulsion system. The propulsion system is approximately 1.25U in size and contains 12 0.1 N thrusters. The system contained a small titanium pressure vessel and was capable of providing approximately 5 m/s DV. In an effort to minimize mass, optimize packing, and substantial reductions in iteration time between designs, aa significant effort was undertaken to utilize additive manufacturing (AM) technology as part of the Seeker propulsion system. The certified AM thrusters were the first known additively manufactured (AM) pressurized plastic components which are designed to meet or exceed NASA standards and are certified for pressurized ground and flight use around operators.

She claimed to have read \\"the classics\\" at an early age and she published her first set of poetry at her own risk in 1826. The collection was called The Children of the Mist and other Poems and it bore the date of 1827. The publication made a loss and even although she was still a child in the eyes of the law she could have been sent to prison, albeit illegally. However she met her husband Charles Tinsley and they married. Usefully he was a solicitor but he was a poor one. Tinsley had to turn herself into a hack writer to raise funds. She said that she was so desperate that she did not check her work, but just moved on to the next task. She ignored poetry and wrote for periodicals including Family Herald, the Monthly Chronicle, the Metropolitan Magazine, People's Journal and the Literary Gazette. Her best work is thought to be her 1848 collection of poems, Lays for the Thoughtful and Solitary which exposed her thoughts on the poor position of women in civilization's hierarchy. In 1853 she published her novel Margaret and the preface had to point out that it was written before Charlotte Bront√´'s novel Villette as it was published in the same year and there were similarities. The following year she published the more original book Women as they are. By one of them which expanded on her own previous theme from 1848 that women should look to their own abilities. She now knew from her own experiences of relying on her father and now her husband that reliance could lead to disappointment. She and her husband moved frequently to try and find a job that suited him. Eventually her husband's precarious finances were solved by an inheritance, but her own peace failed to materialise as her favourite child, George Herbert Tinsley, died of Typhoid in 1877.

Principal Cordillera () is the Andean mountain range that makes up the boundary between Central Chile and neighbouring areas of Argentina. It is also a continental divide between the Atlantic and the Pacific watersheds. It extends in a north-south direction in the Argentine provinces of La Rioja, San Juan and Mendoza and the Chilean regions of Valpara√≠so, Santiago, O'Higgins and Maule. To the east of the Principal Cordillera lies the Frontal Cordillera which is fully in Argentina. Aconcagua, the tallest mountain outside Asia, lies in the Principal Cordillera. Geological history What is today the Principal Cordillera was once a depression that accumulated sediments.Charrier et al. 2006, pp. 93‚Äì94. Lava flows from ancient volcanoes also found their way to the depression. Today these sequences of sedimentary and volcanic rock can be observed high in the Andes, implying their basin was closed and uplifted by tectonic inversion. The said rocks are grouped in the Abanico and Farellones Formation. Tectonic inversion took place 21 to 16 million years (Ma) ago, yet the associated pulse of uplift continued until about 8 Ma ago. The Miocene continental divide was about 20 km to the west of the modern water divide that makes up the Argentina‚ÄìChile border. Subsequent river incision shifted the divide to the east leaving old flattish surfaces hanging. Compression and uplift in this part of the Andes has continued into the present. The Principal Cordillera had risen to heights that allowed for the development of valley glaciers about 1 Ma ago.

Active football career  = Nordstern Basel = Zbinden played mainly in the position as Striker, but also as midfielder. He started his youth football by Nordstern Basel and advanced to the first team in 1978. In his first season by Nordstern they were relegated to the Nationalliga B. The following season, 1979‚Äì80, they accieved immediate promotion. Zbinden scored 12 goals in 25 games in that promotion season. He continued to play for Nordstern until the end of the 1981‚Äì82 Nationalliga A season, as the team again suffered relegation. = FC Basel = Zbinden transferred to local rivals Basel for their 1982‚Äì83 season. At that time Rainer Ohlhauser was the first team manager, he had taken over from Helmut Benthaus. Zbinden played for the club for four years until the season 1985‚Äì86. His further trainers during this period were Ernst August K√ºnnecke, Emil M√ºller and later Benthaus after his return. After three test matches and four matches in the Cup of the Alps, Zbinden played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game at the Landhof on 14 August 1982 as Basel were defeated 0‚Äì1 by the Young Boys. He scored his first goal for his club on 28 August in the home game as Basel won 5‚Äì1 against Vevey-Sports. In his first season with Basel he played 28 of the 30 league matches and all three cup games. Also during the following two seasons Zbinden was mainly a part of the starting eleven. But in their 1985‚Äì86 season, under Benthaus, Zbinden did not get very much playing time, just four out of 15 matches, therefore he decided to move on. = Grenchen = During the winter break of the 1985‚Äì86 Nationalliga A season Zbinden moved on to Grenchen, who had won promotion the previous season. He played all 15 games in the second half of that season, but without scoring a goal. The team ended the season in 15th position and thus with Grenchen Zbinden again suffered relegation. = Wettingen = For the 1986‚Äì87 Nationalliga A season Zbinden signed for Wettingen. He played 26 of the 30 domestic league matches and the three playout games, scoring a total of five goals. But with Wettingen he suffered his second succecutive relegation, this was the fourth relegation of his career. = Bellinzona = For the 1987‚Äì88 Nationalliga A season Zbinden transferred to Bellinzona. The league format had changed, the first stage was a qualification stage for the championship. Bellinzona were unsuccessful and therefore had to play in a promotion/relegation stage. Zbinden played 17 of the 22 games in the first stage, but due to injury just one in second stage. Nevertheless Bellinzona stayed in the top tier of the Swiss football league. Zbinden recovered from his injury during the next seasons first stage, but he was only able to play one game. In the championship group the team Bellinzona could only score 9 goals and so finished in seventh position. = FC Basel = Zbinden returned to FC Basel for their 1989‚Äì90 season, Urs Siegenthaler was trainer at that time. Two seasons earlier Basel had been relegated to the Nationalliga B and had missed the hoped immediate promotion. Zbinden was signed in to strengthen the team. He scored five goals in 17 matches in the qualifying phase and two goals in 10 matches in the promotion/relegation stage. But Basel missed promotion finishing in third position in the league table. Zbinden played another four seasons with Basel, but the team remained unsuccessful in gaining promotion. The further trainers during this second period with Basel were again Ernst August K√ºnnecke, then Bruno Rahmen and Karl Odermatt, who together both acted as interims trainer following K√ºnnecke dismissal and finally Friedel Rausch was his trainer during Basel's 1992‚Äì93 season. Altogether between the years 1982 to 1986 and again from 1989 to 1993, Zbinden played a total of 303 games for Basel, scoring a total of 71 goals. 187 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, 19 in the Swiss Cup, three in the Cup of the Alps and 94 were friendly games. He scored 38 goal in the domestic league, four in the domestic Cup, two in the Cup of the Alps and the other 27 were scored during the test games. = Bellinzona = In his final year as active footballer Zbinden returned to play for Bellinzona for the 1993‚Äì94 season.  FC Basel management  In the years 1996 to 1999 Zbinden worked for Basel as youth trainer.

According to the legend, he was the first to weave cloth from lotus plant fibers, and was granted many boons by the gods as a result of his great skill.  In mythology and history  Mrikanda was the descendant of daughter of Daksha (son of the Hindu god Brahma), who married a rishi and bore him two sons. Mrikanda‚Äîthe elder of the two sons‚Äîhad a son, the renowned sage Markandeya. Mrikanda is venerated as the founder of weaving, and as a result of the gods' gratitude he was granted two boons -- a tiger and a giant. The giant disobeyed Mrikanda ªs orders and was summarily slain, but the tiger was obedient and so lived. According to modern Koshte folklore if a tiger is encountered in the jungle it is enough only to speak Mrikanda's name allowed to prevent being attacked. Mrikanda is still seen as a watchful and protective figure in mythology. Shiva is depicted rescuing the teenage son of Mrikanda. In addition to being the father of modern weaving, he is also venerated as the biological ancestor of the great sage Markandeya, the rishi (sage) who is featured extensively in the Markandeya Purana (meditations on ancient myth, legend, and lore). According to the legends, Mrikanda and his wife Marudmati worshipped Shiva and sought from him the boon of begetting a son. As a result, he was given the choice of either a righteous son, but with a short life on earth or a child of low intelligence but with a long life.

She inherited, and attempted to publish, a controversial collection of letters from Mary Todd Lincoln.  Early life  Myra Bradwell Helmer with her grandfather (and publisher), James B. Bradwell, from a 1900 publication on Illinois history. Myra Bradwell Helmer was born in Chicago, the only child of lawyers Frank Ambrose Helmer and Bessie Bradwell Helmer. Her grandfather James B. Bradwell was a prominent Chicago attorney and abolitionist; her grandmother Myra Bradwell was a publisher and political activist in Illinois, founding editor of the Chicago Legal News in 1868. Bessie Bradwell Helmer continued publishing the Chicago Legal News until 1925, and rescued the publication's subscription book from the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Helmer attended Mrs. Loring's School in Chicago, and graduated from Vassar College in 1910.  Career  Myra Bradwell Helmer was just six years old when she became a published author. A collection of her short stories, titled Short Stories, was published by the Chicago Legal News in 1896, to raise money for the Daily News Fresh Air Fund. Medical experts raised concerns about her mental development, seeing precocity as a risk factor for early breakdown. In 1903, the teenaged Helmer published another collection, this time her poetry, verses about her family members, her pets, golf, and other topics, under the title A Child's Thoughts in Rhyme. In 1909 she co-wrote Father Gander Golf Book with Inez Lenore Klumph, again as a fundraiser for the Daily News Fresh Air Fund. Helmer was also a golfer. She held records and championships at many of the courses in the Chicago area. In 1906 she qualified for a major championship, but had to forfeit to return to Vassar College for school. In 1913 she won the Western Championship in Memphis, Tennessee, and played at the Women's Championship that year in Delaware. Myra Helmer Pritchard was an active member of the Chicago Woman's Club. and a contributor to Dogdom, a magazine about dogs. Myra Bradwell Helmer Pritchard in a bridal portrait, 1915.  The Lincoln-Bradwell letters  Mary Todd Lincoln corresponded with Myra and James Bradwell, Myra Pritchard's grandparents in the 1870s, before, during, and after her brief confinement to an insane asylum. The letters were said to reflect Mrs. Lincoln's distressed mental state and her disapproval of her son Robert Todd Lincoln. The letters from Mrs. Lincoln to the Bradwells were left to Bradwell's daughter, Bessie Helmer, and then to Bessie's daughter, Myra Pritchard. \\"My mother was most anxious that these letters be published,\\" explained Pritchard, \\"because she felt that Mrs. Abraham Lincoln had been maligned and that these letters would explain much of the real Mrs. Lincoln to the world and place her in a more favorable light.\\" Myra Pritchard wrote a book-length manuscript about these letters in 1927, but the family of Robert Lincoln threatened legal action and bought the manuscript rather than allowing its publication. Against the agreement with the Lincoln family, Myra Pritchard kept a copy of the letters and her manuscript, but ordered that it be burned upon her death. The executor of her estate, her sister-in-law Margreta Pritchard, burned the manuscript. A few years later, the sister-in-law was persuaded by a Lincoln collector to burn the typed copies of the letters as well. Although the Bradwell-Lincoln letters and Pritchard's manuscript were believed to be completely lost, a surviving copy was discovered in 2005, in a steamer trunk belonging to a Lincoln family attorney. Myra Helmer Pritchard's 1927 manuscript was published in 2011 as The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Widow, as Revealed by Her Own Letters by Southern Illinois University Press.  Personal life  Myra Bradwell Helmer married a Canadian medical doctor, James Stuart Pritchard, in 1915. They were avid collie owners, and lived in Battle Creek, Michigan, where James was the president of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. She was widowed when the doctor died from thyroid cancer in 1940, and she died in 1947, aged 57 years.\\"Mrs. Pritchard Dies, Graduate of Vassar\\". Poughkeepsie Journal. February 4, 1947. p. 4.

He founded Brown Telephone Company, today known as Sprint Corporation. Brown, whose name was often abbreviated to C. L. Brown, was a welfare capitalist and benefactor of the community of Abilene, Kansas. A pioneer in Kansas electrification and telephony, Brown consolidated and expanded many early telephone systems, power generation plants, and electrical distribution systems in Kansas and other states. One of his legacy companies, United Telecommunications, merged with Southern Pacific Communications to form Sprint Corporation. Parts of his social legacy endure two miles south of Abilene in the Brown Memorial Home for the Aged and in Camp Brown, the Coronado Area Council scout camp at Abilene. Brown's mill/power dam on Turkey Creek is still a cornerstone of the adjoining Brown Memorial Park.  Early life  Brown‚Äôs father, Jacob Brown was a grist mill owner. Brown lost his arm when he was ten in a mill accident. He had worked as a teacher and also managed a creamery in Wichita. Brown first built a local electric company, Abilene Electric Light Works to generate electricity from the Smoky Hill River.  Entrepreneurship and philanthropy  Cleyson Brown founded the Brown Telephone Company in 1899 in Abilene, Kansas with his brother Jacob Brown.The local request to start a phone company to challenge the local Bell Telephone company was only five years after the Bell Telephone patents had expired. It is lately known as Sprint.  Other ventures  Brown then ventured into shoe stores, grocery stores, gravel and sand company, hotels, news service, and broadcast station, insurance companies and oil concerns creating an empire. He also formed the Brown Memorial Foundation (1926) in memory of his parents. A park in around 200 acres was built for the public for free, which included an amusement park with a lake, zoo, golf course, tennis courts, and other attractions.

Later, expansion work added a second storey and the thatched roof was replaced with plain tiles. The building faces west towards the road and at the front on the left-hand side there are two original large timber-framed gabled roof dormers with casement windows, on the right there are two more however these are brick additions with applied timber- framing.

Biography Hallam was previously an organic farmer on a farm near Llandeilo in South Wales; he attributes the destruction of his business to a series of extreme weather events. Between at least 2017 and early 2019 he was studying for a PhD at King's College London, researching how to achieve social change through civil disobedience and radical movements. In January 2017, in an action to urge King's College London to divest from fossil fuels, Hallam and another person, using water-soluble chalk-based spray paint, painted \\"Divest from oil and gas\\", \\"Now!\\" and \\"Out of time\\" on the university's Strand campus entrance. They were arrested in February when they again spray painted the university's Great Hall, charged with criminal damage and fined ¬£500. In May 2019, after a three-day trial at Southwark Crown Court, they were cleared by a jury of all charges, having argued in their defence that their actions were a proportionate response to the climate crisis. In March 2017, Hallam went on hunger strike to demand the university divest from fossil fuels‚Äîthe institution had millions of pounds invested in fossil fuels but no investment in renewable energy. Five weeks after the first protest, the university removed ¬£14m worth of investments from fossil fuel companies and pledged to become carbon neutral by 2025. Later in 2017, Hallam was a leading member of activist group Stop Killing Londoners an anti-pollution campaign of mass civil disobedience that they hoped would result in the arrest and imprisonment of activists. Hallam with Stuart Basden and two others were prosecuted and some pledged to go on hunger strike if imprisoned. Hallam is a co-founder of environmental pressure group Extinction Rebellion, with Gail Bradbrook and Simon Bramwell. He stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast (0.04%). Hallam was interviewed by Stephen Sackur on BBC HARDtalk on 15August 2019. Video 24:37. (Available on YouTube). Hallam and four other activists were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on 12 September 2019, the day before a planned action to pilot drones in the exclusion zone around Heathrow Airport in order to disrupt flights. Three days later, in an action organised by Heathrow Pause, Hallam was arrested in the vicinity of Heathrow Airport apparently in breach of bail conditions from the previous arrest requiring him to not to be within of any airport or possess drone equipment. He was remanded in custody until 14 October. In an interview with Die Zeit on 20 November 2019, Hallam called the Holocaust \\"just another fuckery in human history\\". This comment was made in the context of a broader discussion on genocides throughout human history, where Hallam compared the Nazi Holocaust to the Congo genocide; as he stated the \\"fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history\\" adding that the Belgians \\"went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it.\\" Hallam's controversial comparison has drawn support from African activists the Stop the Maangamizi: We Charge Genocide/Ecocide! Campaign, who while critical of the tone of his language, have lauded his honesty and willingness to highlight crimes committed by colonial powers in Africa.

Plot  Tepulpai, a young 10-year-old boy, is rejected approval to becoming a \\"Great One\\", although he dreams of becoming a Shaman. The village is soon visited by an Incan tax collector, who takes away the village's most precious treasure, the Huaca, and takes away most of their crops, leaving the villagers with nothing left to eat. Walumama, an elderly woman, faints at the absence of the statue, while Tepulpai is very angry and says they must get the Huaca back. When he is asked to leave, he is determined to find the Huaca and starts on his journey. As Tepulpai crosses the rope bridge on his way to Cusco, he finds Naira, who wishes to follow him and retrieve the Huaca. Tepulpai is unhappy with Naira and immediately refuses, but Naira crosses the rope bridge herself, and Tepulpai reluctantly agrees that she can travel with him. The two eventually find the city of Cusco, and Naira tells Tepulpai, he should start thinking twice before making decisions. As they argue, they find the chasqui of the Inca, who appeared very ill and tired. Before he dies, he tells the children about a floating house on the waters holding beings from a different world, describing them as \\"gods\\" with metal skins that spitfire, and they must send his message. Tepulpai takes the chasqui's pututu and starts traveling to Cusco. The two follow two men to the Great Inca. Naira agrees to tell about the message, but only if the Huaca is returned. The Great Inca, however, does not believe the story, and believes it was made up by the Great Observer. Enraged, Tepulpai declares that the Great Inca be \\"thrown out of his stupid tray\\", but soon after, the \\"gods\\" arrive and attack, knocking the Great Inca to the ground. The \\"gods\\" are revealed to be thieves, and the children barely escape with the Huaca. They manage to hide in an abandoned house, and Tepulpai fools the thieves with Kirkincho, an armadillo, while Naira runs back to the village with the Huaca. The thieves, however, find out that Tepulpai was not holding the real Huaca, and he and Kirkincho are sucked into a whirlpool. Tepulpai finds himself in an underground system and finds the blind Great Observer and his puma, who sees for him. The Great Observer gives him food and dries him off. He tells Tepulpai there is no way out of the labyrinth, and helps him realize that the Great Condor's feather he owned was taken without permission. Under a blanket, he silently apologizes to the Great Condor for taking its feather. It forgives him, and the feather blows in the wind, leading him out of the labyrinth. The Great Condor flies past the children and gives them a ride back to the village, while Kirkincho and Naira's llama, Lamita, run back on their own. Naira soon discovers that the Great Condor was shot by one of the thieves' guns, and they receive a rough landing. Tepulpai holds the now broken Huaca, and finds the Shaman, who is revealed to be the Great Condor. The men in metal soon arrive, and attempt to steal the Huaca. The Huaca breaks, and the crops are destroyed by an explosion. Tepulpai finds that Walumama has joined the ancestors and discovers seeds hidden in the Huaca. He offers them to Pachamama, and while it rains, everyone dances to the music.

Early life and education  Emery was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, the third child of Noah Emery and Jane Hale. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy starting at the age of twelve in 1788 and in 1795 graduated from Dartmouth College. He read law with Edward St. Loe Livermore to gain admission to the bar.  Career  Emery taught at Phillips Exeter for a year in 1797, with Daniel Webster being one of his students, before beginning his legal practice in Parsonsfield, Maine. In 1807, he moved to Portland. In 1816, Emery attended the Brunswick Convention that voted to separate the state of Maine from Massachusetts; three years later he would serve as a delegate to the 1819 Maine Constitutional Convention for Cumberland County, though he did not sign the constitution. He represented Portland in the newly created Maine House of Representatives for three years starting in 1820. During a border dispute that would lead to the Aroostook War between the United States and the United Kingdom, Emery played a role in the arbitrations. King William I of the Netherlands had, as a neutral arbiter, drawn a border line between the two countries. In order to ease negotiations between the two countries, the government of Maine proposed to yield all territory north of the Saint John River and east of Saint Francis River to the federal government, in return for one million acres (4,000 km2) of land in the Michigan Territory. Emery, along with Judge William Pitt Preble and Maine Legislator Reuel Williams, was sent as a delegate to negotiate the deal with the federal government, though the plan was ultimately rejected. On October 22, 1834, Governor Robert P. Dunlap appointed him as an Associate Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to replace Nathan Weston, who was being elevated to the position of Chief Justice, and he served until October 21, 1841. He was succeeded by John S. Tenney.  Personal life  Emery married the daughter of New Hampshire Governor John Taylor Gilman, Nancy Taylor, with whom he had six children. He died on August 24, 1861.

The thought experiment concerning Alice and Bob is as follows: Alice throws a k qubit quantum state into a black hole that is entangled with Bob's quantum computer. Bob collects the Hawking radiation emitted by the Black hole and feeds it into his quantum computer where he applies the appropriate quantum gates that will decode Alice's state. Bob only needs at least k qubits from the black hole's Hawking radiation to decode Alice's quantum state. The black hole can be thought of as a quantum information mirror, because it returns scrambled information almost instantly. With a delay that can be account for by the scrambling time and the time it takes for the black hole to radiate the qubits.

He is editor-at- large of The Post Millennial, a Canadian conservative news website. In May 2017, Ngo was fired from the Portland State University student newspaper, The Vanguard, for, according to the paper's editor, publishing on Twitter an out- of-context video segment of a student's remarks at a panel, which were later seized on by the far-right website Breitbart News. Ngo argued that his firing was an attempt to stifle free speech, garnering support from some conservatives. Ngo then worked as a writer and editor for Quillette. In June 2019, Ngo was attacked and injured by unidentified participants at a counter protest to a Proud Boys march in Portland. Ngo was hit with a milkshake and claimed that blows to his head caused him to suffer a brain injury. He blamed antifa activists for the assault. Ngo later testified on antifa and related First Amendment issues before a U.S. House subcommittee. In August 2019, The Daily Beast and Vice reported on footage from May showing Ngo with armed Patriot Prayer members prior to an attack on Cider Riot, a cider house frequented by antifa protesters.2 of 6 defendants -- but not Joey Gibson -- plead to rioting in Patriot Prayer-antifa clash. The Oregonian, January 13, 2020Super Awkward for Right-Wing Blogger Andy Ngo to Make a Cameo in Video of Plot Against Antifa. Vice News, August 27, 2019 Ngo reported on the attack at Cider Riot but not the meeting by Patriot Prayer beforehand. The Daily Beast and Vice News alleged that Ngo was aware of the planned attack; Ngo disputed this and called the accusations \\"defamatory and false.\\"  Early life and education  Ngo was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. His parents immigrated from Vietnam by boat in 1978. Ngo's father worked as a police officer, prior to his relocation to the United States. Raised in a Buddhist family, Ngo converted to Christianity in high school. After a period of time as an evangelical Christian, he became disillusioned and took an interest in skepticism. He subsequently became an atheist and was strongly against organized religion, which was reflected in his social media activity in the form of \\"inflammatory language\\". In a December 2016 interview with Skeptical Inquirer, Ngo stated that language does not reflect his current beliefs. While attending the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Ngo volunteered with AmeriCorps. He graduated from UCLA in 2009 with a graphic design degree, but found it hard to find a job, so he had period of unemployment and worked as a photographer at a used car dealership and in various minimum wage jobs. In the mid 2010s, Ngo came out as gay while visiting relatives in rural Vietnam. In 2013, he began volunteering as a photographer at the Center for Inquiry in Portland. In 2015, Ngo enrolled in a master's program at Portland State University for political science, with research interests in secularism and political Islam. While attending the school, he joined the Freethinkers of Portland State University.  Career  = The Vanguard = While enrolled at Portland State University (PSU), Ngo worked as a multimedia editor at The Vanguard, a student newspaper. In 2017, he drew national attention after he was let go from The Vanguard and accused the newspaper of firing him over his conservative political beliefs. After Ngo attended an April 26 interfaith panel at the university and used his personal account to tweet a video clip of the Muslim student's remarks, Breitbart News picked up and circulated his video within 24 hours which led to a \\"social media firestorm.\\" Four days later, The Vanguards editor, Colleen Leary, fired Ngo and stated that he was dismissed because his tweet was unethical, reflecting a reckless oversimplification and violation of journalistic ethics. According to Ngo, he was fired from the paper for political incorrectness, although he was not reporting for The Vanguard at the time. Leary considered his paraphrasing of the Muslim student's remarks be \\"a half-truth\\", meant to incite a reaction, and refuted that the dismissal was motivated by previous campus controversies over Ngo's work. Critics from conservative media characterized the firing as an attempt to stifle free speech. In May 2017, Ngo wrote an op-ed for the National Review titled \\"Fired for Reporting the Truth\\". He also engaged in online discussions about the incident and on the pro-Donald Trump subreddit /r/The Donald where he called the firing part of a \\"trend towards self- censorship in the name of political correctness\\". Leary reported that since the incident did not receive much attention on campus, it left her with questions about the relationship between Breitbart and Ngo. The Muslim student whose comments Ngo shared by tweet later said, \\"I thought I would feel proud after putting something like this [interfaith panel] together. Not feel like this.\\" = Later work = In March 2018, Ngo filmed protests and a disruptive audience when feminist critic Christina Hoff Sommers spoke at the Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland. On August 29, 2018, Ngo wrote an op-ed titled \\"A Visit to Islamic England\\" for The Wall Street Journal. In the article, Ngo wrote of his experiences in two neighborhoods in East London, including visits to a mosque and an Islamic center. From these experiences, he concluded that London was afflicted with \\"failed multiculturalism\\". He falsely connected alcohol-free zones in parts of London to the Muslim-majority populations. Ngo was accused of Islamophobia and subsequently issued a correction. Alex Lockie from Business Insider criticized Ngo's article for \\"fear monger[ing] around England's Muslim population\\" and cherry-picking evidence, and for mischaracterizing the neighborhood near the East London Mosque. Steve Hopkins from HuffPost stated that \\"some of his [Ngo's] assertions have already been disproved\\". In October 2018, Ngo started a podcast entitled Things You Should Ngo. His interviewees have included Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin and Carl Benjamin (who uses the pen name \\"Sargon of Akkad\\" online). Until August 2019, Ngo was a writer and sub-editor at Quillette. Several media outlets, including The Oregonian and The Rolling Stone have been critical of Ngo and described him as a \\"right-wing provocateur\\". BuzzFeed News said that \\"Ngo's work is probably best described as media activism\\" and that he engages in \\"participant reporting\\". New York magazine cites Ngo as an example of \\"busybody journalism\\" which is distinguished from experiential journalism by its \\"focus on the individual reporter's feelings\\" and absence of editorial fact-checking. As of November 2019, Ngo is editor-at-large of The Post Millennial, a conservative Canadian news website. = Confrontations with antifa activists and assault = Ngo has labelled several journalists, including Shane Burley and Alexander Reid Ross, as \\"antifa ideologues\\". According to Voxs Zack Beauchamp, Ngo has doxed at least one political activist by publishing her full name. He has also been accused of using selectively edited videos and sharing misleading and inaccurate information to paint antifa activists as violent and underplay the violence of the far-right. Ngo has investigated what he calls \\"illiberal reactions\\", which he says threaten college freedoms. In February 2018, Ngo and his student group Freethinkers of PSU invited former Google engineer James Damore, the author of a Google diversity memo, to speak on the campus. According to Ngo, his group was threatened with violence and were intimidated by antifa protesters, but this claim has been disputed. He later stated that antifa protesters did not disrupt the event. During the event, a portion of the audience walked out in protest against Damore. Ngo filmed the disruption, but said \\"it [had not been] a plan to get national attention for [himself].\\"  Coverage of Patriot Prayer rallies  In November 2018, Ngo live- streamed the Him Too rally organized by a Patriot Prayer member in downtown Portland, and was sprayed with silly string by antifascist protesters. Ngo said the Democratic politicians are in a difficult position as they have a constituency that \\"share similar goals and sympathies [as antifa]\\". Ngo called for \\"more clarity in their [Democratic] leadership, and to come out against violence, against this type of anarchy, and not view it through a partisan lens as they are currently\\". = May Day = On May 1 2019, Ngo covered demonstrations and counter protests in Portland associated with International Workers Day or May Day. He reported being punched and blasted with pepper spray while filming two separate May Day events. In August 2019, a video of Ngo surfaced where he is seen laughing, while standing next to the members of the far-right group Patriot Prayer as they plan an attack on anti-fascist patrons at Cider Riot following the May Day protests. He later followed the group to the bar where they allegedly attacked the patrons. The video is part of the court documents in the ongoing lawsuit against Patriot Prayer members; two of whom have pled guilty to inciting the riot. One of the victims of the attack was knocked unconscious with a baton and suffered a broken vertebrae‚ÄîNgo later posted a video of her being attacked and identified her online. Portland Mercury quoted an undercover antifascist embedded in Patriot Prayer saying that Andy Ngo has an \\"understanding\\" with the far-right group, that the group \\"protects him and he protects them\\".  Assault during coverage of the Proud Boys rally  On June 29, 2019, while covering protests at a rally organized by the far-right group Proud Boys in Portland, Ngo was punched in the head, kicked and hit with at least one milkshake. He blamed his injuries on antifa counter-protesters, although no attackers were identified. He walked away and reported what happened in a livestream, during which a medic arrived to check on him. The video of the June 29 incident where Ngo was assaulted by masked demonstrators went viral and led the Proud Boys, a designated hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, to organize a follow up event in Portland known as the End Domestic Terrorism rally for August 17, 2019. Ngo's attorney wrote that he was subsequently taken to hospital for cerebral hemorrhaging. Writing for BuzzFeed News, Joseph Bernstein stated that Ngo had sent him a copy of his discharge paperwork from the hospital showing that he had suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ngo retained attorney Harmeet Dhillon to investigate the response of the Portland Police Bureau. Texas Senator Ted Cruz called on federal authorities to investigate Ted Wheeler, Portland's mayor who also serves as the city's police commissioner. Democratic Party presidential candidate Andrew Yang wished Ngo a speedy recovery. Former Vice President and Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden and then- candidate Eric Swalwell also condemned the attack. The Portland based newspaper Willamette Week stated that \\"it is increasingly clear he is coordinating his movements and his message with right-wing groups\\". Bernstein reported that \\"[Ngo]'s literal brand is that anti-fascists are violent and loathe him\\", adding that he \\"has been building to a dramatic confrontation with the Portland far left for months, his star rising along with the severity of the encounters.\\" Bernstein stated that Ngo \\"is willing to make himself the story and to stream himself doing it. He proceeds from a worldview and seeks to confirm it, without asking to what degree his coverage becomes a self- fulfilling prophecy\\", pointing out that Ngo even proposed going to \\"a far-left hangout\\" during the writing of the profile piece. = Departure from Quillette = On August 26, 2019, The Daily Beast reported that Ngo was leaving Quillette. Earlier in the day, Portland Mercury covered a video that showed Ngo standing near members of Patriot Prayer, the far-right group active in Portland, as they planned violence at a bar frequented by left-wing activists. Ngo, who ultimately blamed the violence on antifascist activists, is seen smiling and laughing at the discussion. Ngo's name was deleted from Quillettes masthead, and the site from Ngo's Twitter feed, at this time. The editor of Quillette, Claire Lehmann, told The Daily Beast that the two developments were not linked and that Ngo had left the website several weeks earlier. On August 30, Spectator USA published an article by Ngo in which he stated he did not know about the far-right group planning the attack, that he \\"[only] caught snippets of various conversations\\" and \\"was preoccupied on [his] phone\\", describing the accusations as \\"lies\\".  Legal  In June 2020, Ngo sued individuals purportedly associated with antifa, seeking $900,000 in damages for assault and emotional distress, and an injunction to prevent further harassment. The lawsuit, filed on Ngo's behalf by his attorney Harmeet Dhillon, cites Rose City Antifa, five other named defendants, and additional unknown assailants. It stems from multiple alleged attacks on Ngo in Portland during 2019: at a demonstration on May 1; at his local gym on May 7; and during a protest on June 29. In particular, the suit accuses Rose City Antifa of a \\"pattern of racketeering activities\\". On June 29, 2020, Ngo testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform's Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties during a virtual briefing on \\"The First Amendment Under Attack: Examining Government Violence Against Peaceful Civil Rights Protesters and the Journalists Covering Them\\", during which he stated that protesters perpetrated violence against journalists and not law enforcement officers.  Political views  Ngo has often been described as right-wing and conservative, although he does not describe himself as such. When pressed to pick a political label in a July 2019 podcast interview for The Joe Rogan Experience, Ngo responded that he considers himself to be center-right.

Stage directors and theatre impresarios with whom he worked included his brother, Am√©rico Botta, Luis C√©sar Amadori, Ivo Pelay, Jos√© Gonz√°lez Castillo, El√≠as Alippi, Carlos Osorio and Antonio De Bassi. There were also musical collaborations with Antonio and Arturo de Bassi, Francisco Lomuto and Francisco Canaro. Several of Botta's film scripts were co-written with the Italian-born Argentinian Luis C√©sar Amadori who then went on to direct the resulting film himself. One relatively early result of that process was Puerto nuevo (film), a tango musical film drama film which had its first showings in a cinema in a Buenos Aires slum quarter (\\"Villa Miseria\\"). Three years later, in 1939, Botta himself tried his hand at directing, with his production of Bartolo ten√≠a una flauta (loosely, \\"Bartolo had a flute\\"), starring Luis Sandrini. Antonio Botta also wrote a number of radio plays and several songs. He teamed up with the composer-musician Francisco Lomuto to write a number of works, such as the song \\"Si soy as√≠\\" (loosely, \\"Yes, that's how I am\\"), a slinky tangoesque song of celebration addressed to all women, regardless of age or marital status. The composition caught the spirit of the age: the well known tango performer Carlos Gardel made a recording. Another particularly successful collaboration by Botta and Lomuto, albeit with a very different spirit and them, as \\"La canci√≥n del deporte\\" (loosely, \\"The song of sports\\"). In 1947 Antonio Botta and Francisco undertook a successful tour of Spain together.

It is entirely part of U.S. Route 80 (US 80) and Georgia State Route 26 (SR 26).  History  In October 1919, City Engineer William O.D. Rockwell proposed a military memorial boulevard called \\"Victory Avenue\\" that would stretch from Waters Avenue to Thunderbolt, in honor of the fallen soldiers from World War I. Victory Drive was once a series of unpaved roads that connected the western edge of Savannah to the small fishing village of Warsaw which, after 1921, was incorporated as the Town of Thunderbolt. The western part of Victory‚Äîwhich was once named King Street‚Äîis now renamed 43rd Street. This portion of Victory served as an extension of Estill avenue that is now between Bull Street and Waters Avenue. 43rd street was a block north from Estill Avenue, creating a sharp turn that connected the two sections of the road. 43rd Street, Estill Avenue and Dale Avenue made up the old version of Victory Drive. = Great Savannah races = Racer coming toward the finish line in the Great Savannah Races Throughout the years of 1908-1911, the U.S. International Grand Pix automobile races were held in Savannah. Estill and Dale Avenue was selected by the American Automobile Association (AAA) as the location for the first ever U.S. International Grand Prix Race and was the final stretch of the racetrack. These races brought many economic benefits to the City of Savannah. The roadways were paved with oiled-gravel and Augusta Grave‚Äîa mixture of clay and coarse sand‚Äîwhich helped the racers reach speeds surpassing . In 1912, however, the AAA decided to relocate to Long Island, New York despite its success in Savannah, Georgia.  Affect on real estate  The races brought a great opportunity to sell real estate to spectators visiting for the event and improvements around the landscape and the residential development began. Estill Avenue was lined with 475 sabal palmettos planted by the City of Savannah Park and Tree Commission. Harvey Granger president of the Chatham Land and Hotel Company proposed \\"beautification\\" of Estill Avenue including the division of Estill Avenue with multiple lanes of travel separated by the iconic medians of Victory Drive. Demolition of the grandstands and the visitor seating began around the time Estill Avenue was divided. After the demolition, the land construction began on luxurious homes and residences along both Estill and Dale Avenue. = Redevelopment = Harvey Granger commissioned the city's Park and Tree Commission to plant trees and take care of them along Estill Avenue as well to plant trees on the median. Commissioner Oliver T. Bacon saw the success of the plantings, so improvement on Dale Avenue began to take effect as well. In 1913 widening of the avenue and paving began, as well as installation of granite curbing and the development of a landscaped median. It took nine years for the redevelopment to be complete. The granite curbing was placed in 1921 completing Dale Avenue.  World War 1 Remembrance  To honor the fallen soldiers of WW I, palm trees and flowers were planted along the entire median of the street. In 1929 Victory Drive boasted 400 palmetto trees. In 1935, the Park and Tree Commission planted an additional 317 palmetto trees along the historical corridor costing around $2,000. By 1950, 600 palmetto trees were in place and Victory Drive was decorated with approximate 2,800 palmettos, and claimed this as the longest avenue of palms in the nation.

Composers began transitioning their compositional and melodic techniques into a new musical form which became known as the Romantic Era or Romanticism due to the implementation of lyrical melodies as opposed to the linear compositional style of Classical music.  Contrast between Classical and Romantic styles  Classical music was known for its clarity and regularity of structure, or \\"natural simplicity\\", thought of as an elegant international musical style with balanced four-bar phrases, clear-cut cadences, repetition, and sequence. Sonata form was the foundation for a large number of pieces which provided a foundation for the new era of Romanticism. Characterized by lyrical melodies, chromaticism and dissonance, and dramatic dynamics, the Romantic era evoked emotions assembled by sovereign story lines and nationalist marches reflecting change.Lawrence Kramer, \\"The Mirror of Tonality: Transitional Features of Nineteenth-Century Harmony\\", 19th-Century Music, 4.3 (Spring, 1981), 191-208. . New musical vocabulary began to further develop using terms like \\"dolce\\" or \\"dolente\\", in addition to enriched harmonic and rhythmic language. Orchestral forms like symphonic poem, choral symphony, and works for solo voice and orchestra, began to draw other art forms closer. Romantic music was a self-conscious break from the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment as well as a reaction to socio-political desire for greater human freedom from despotism. The movement sought to express the liberty, fraternity, and equality which writers such as Heinrich Heine and Victor Hugo artistically defended by creating new lyric poetry. There was a new surrender to nature, nostalgia for the past, a turn towards the mystical, new attention to national identity, interest in the autobiographical, and a general discontentment with musical formulas and conventions exercised in Classical compositions. Conductors became the central figures in orchestral performances, responsible for the sonic flow of larger pieces.  Stages of the transition  = Sturm und Drang = The Sturm und Drang or \\"storm and drive\\" was a proto-Romant√≠c movement that helped establish the aesthetics of the Romantic era. Curated by Haydn, it contrasted with the simple pieces of the Classical era into obvious and dramatic emotionalism sought by Romantic composers. Composers such as Haydn were fond of having compositional work reflect the turbulent political climate. This led to the creation of the Farewell Symphony No. 45 in F Minor, containing several characteristics of this transition through long slow adagio and sharp turns to exemplify the demands of wavering opinions and philosophical themes taking place socially. = Main transition = The Industrial Revolution facilitated a dramatic expansion in orchestra size and greater diversity in instruments. The main transition was promoted by improvements to the piano, with cast-iron frames enabling thicker strings and deeper brilliant tones. Likewise, new instruments were created such as the ophecleide, and earlier instruments like the piccolo and English horn were improved, to contribute to the new dream-like interpretation of the past. New public concert halls accommodated the growing size of orchestras. It was during the main transitional period that a distinction between \\"highbrow\\" and \\"lowbrow\\" compositional works was established, with popular \\"light music\\" seen as entertainment and \\"art music\\" viewed as serious listening.  Transitional artists, composers, and works  It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the emergent discipline of Musikwissenschaft (musicology) began to identify which composers contributed to the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, better known for composing classical music, incorporated opera, concerto, symphony, sonata, and string quartets which introduced Romantic qualities to music of the time. The concept of programmatic music was prevalent among transitional pieces such as Ludwig van Beethoven's titles of Eroica, Pastoral, and Pathetique. Giving compositions characteristic names was expanded upon by Romantic composers such as Richard Strauss and became standard. Franz Schubert took part in the Classical to Romantic transition by being considered the last of the Classical composers in his earlier instrumental pieces, and the first of the romantics through his 600 art songs that were melodic and harmonic.Br√Ændu≈üa Tudor, 'Classical and Romantic in Sonata in A minor op. 164 D 537 by Franz Schubert', Artes. Journal of musicology, 12 (2012), 105‚Äì15. After the transitional period, the virtuoso piano styles of the Romantics Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt were important to consolidating the Romantic movement, with Franz Schubert, Carl Maria von Weber, and John Field being prominent in the generation of early Romanticism.

In 2014, Wood was awarded a DECRA fellowship to investigate tooth enamel diagenesis and its impact on radiocarbon dating. Her early work focused on the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Iberia. This included refining radiocarbon dating techniques for bone and charcoal. The utilisation of the ultrafiltration method showed that Neanderthals were not contemporary to anatomically modern humans in southern Iberia. More recent work has used radiocarbon dating to assess the colonization of Australia, as at Riwi, Kimberley. In 2016 she was awarded with the Women in Research Citation Award, presented by The Australian National University and Clarivate Analytics. She has written a number of popular science articles on radiocarbon dating.  Selected publications  * Wood, Rachel Elizabeth, et al. 2013.

She earned a Bachelor's degree at University of California, Los Angeles (Fine Arts, 1963) and a Master's degree from Goddard College (Marital and family therapy, 1972). She was a professor and director of the Faculty of Clinical Art Therapy at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. She worked as an art psychotherapist in the psychiatric department of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. As an honorary member of the American Professional Association of Art Therapists, she contributed to the spread of art therapy first in the US and increasingly in Europe and around the world. Landgarten led numerous workshops in Germany, Sweden, Russia, Israel, South Africa and Brazil. In addition, she wrote several books, of which two were translated into German. The Helen B. Landgarten Art Therapy Clinic at Loyola Marymount University was founded in 2007. In her first book, entitled Clinical Art Therapy, Landgarten conveys her wealth of experience gained through decades of practice. This fundamental work shows the full scope of application of the therapy form while working with all age groups in the most diverse settings. In her second book, Art Therapy as Family Therapy, the author deals exclusively with art therapy for families. Case studies of various diagnoses are structured in terms of developmental chronology and show the conclusive combination of both forms of therapy, founded on a common, partnership-based level of argumentation for parents, children and even grandparents. The collaborative work within the framework of family therapy forms the basis for the analysis of unconscious messages and thus the prerequisite for understanding and change. In 1942, she married Nathan Landgarten. They had two children. Landgardten died in Los Angeles, February 23, 2011, after a stroke.

Through the trials of its heroine, Opie explores the challenge of living virtuously in a corrupt society.  Synopsis  After Catherine Shirley's father dies in battle, she is adopted by her grandfather, General Shirley. Catherine is deeply pious and trusting in other people. She marries Lord Shirley (her cousin), and they have twins. After he wrongly suspects her of infidelity, he takes the children away from her. Lucy Merle (Catherine's republican friend) and Lord Livesay (a friend of Catherine's husband) successfully prove Catherine's innocence. Catherine is briefly reunited with her husband and children, but she dies shortly afterwards.  Reception  Opie was dismayed to find that Valentine's Eve displeased many of her Quaker friends and acquaintances - in part because of its allusions to adultery, seduction, and a brothel. The novel was not received particularly well by reviewers. One reviewer felt that it 'is not calculated either by its conduct or its circumstances to display advantageously the talents of the writer'. The character of Catherine has similarities with the virtuous heroine of Samuel Richardson's popular novel Clarissa (1748). However, Isabelle Marie Cosgrave argues that the ending of Valentine's Eve is even bleaker than that of Clarissa. She suggests that Valentine's Eve implicitly criticises both 'worldly' society and the Established Church, for failing to support those who try and live according to their Christian principles: > \\"It is through society‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge the importance of religion > in everyday life ‚Äì and the malice that virtuous piety seems to invite ‚Äì that > Catherine Shirley comes to die ...

Current legislation  The creation, spreading, broadcasting and ownership of pornography are legal in the Netherlands. Pornography depicting persons under the age of 18, or appearing to depict such persons, is illegal to produce, spread or own under child pornography laws. Bestiality and pornography (appearing to) depict sexual acts with animals are illegal in the Netherlands since 2008.  Political history  The 17th century saw a rise in interest in and production of pornographic literature in the Republic of the Netherlands, including the publication of 'The glorious deeds of John Shit, dedicated to the kackhuys' (De doorluchtige daden van Jan Stront, opgedragen aan het kackhuys) in 1684. Around 1900, the availability and production of pornography increased due to technological advances in printing and photography. Protestant groups protested the immorality of pornography and called for legislation. On May 20, 1911, the Morality Law (Dutch: Zedelijkheidswet or Wet-Regout, officially Wet van 20 mei 1911 tot bestrijding van de zedeloosheid en beteugeling van de speelzucht) was passed, banning prostitution, trafficking of women, brothels, contraceptives, gambling, abortion, homosexuality and the spreading, creation and display of pornography.Regout, Edmond Robert Hubert (1863-1913) On 9 October 1967, the first public broadcast of nudity on Dutch television took place. Visual artist Phil Bloom sat naked in a chair in Hoepla, a program by VPRO. In 1968, the first Dutch erotic magazine Chick was launched. In 1970, the magazine was involved in a lawsuit known as the Chick-arrest.Handelingen 0000122011 p. 1429 - 1490 (Vergaderjaar 1984-1985)  Overheid.nl > Handelingen, overheid.nl Chick won the lawsuit as the Supreme Court ruled the magazine was not 'offensive to decency' (Dutch: aanstotelijk voor de eerbaarheid), paving the way for legal pornography and spawning the creation of other erotic magazines, including Candy, Rosie, Seventeen and Tuk. In 1972, a public broadcast of the film Deep Throat in a cinema led to the Deep Throat-arrest. The Supreme Court ruled that while the broadcast was illicit, it was not 'offensive to decency', and the movie was permitted to be screened to persons aged 18 or over in theaters that could seat up to 50 people.HR 18 april 2014, , NJ 1979/93 On February 18, 1977, Cinema Parisien in Amsterdam aired the film in a theater that could seat more than 50 people in order to provoke a test case. The first law to legalise pornography in the Netherlands was drafted in 1979, which included a lift on the ban on making, spreading or owning pornographic text, images and items. The law sought to amend article 240 of the criminal code (Dutch: wijziging van artikel 240 van het Wetboek van Strafrecht en van enige andere bepalingen). The law took until 1984 to be accepted by the Dutch Parliament, being edited several times in the process, including the last change in 1984 which stated that the ban for child pornographic images would not be lifted. The law came into effect in 1986, after several years in which sexshops had been tolerated. In 2019, almost 9 in 10 (89%) known URLs containing child sexual abuse material were hosted in Europe. The Netherlands hosts 71% of the child sexual abuse content found by the IWF. This equates to 93,962 URLs and is an increase from 2018 when the Netherlands was found to be hosting 47% of all known child sexual abuse material. = Child pornography legislation in the Netherlands = In 2006, the Party for Neighbourly Love, Freedom, and Diversity sought to legalise the possession of child pornography, under the condition that it would be approved when the children involved participated voluntarily and were not exploited. The party was disbanded in 2010, after the party had failed to receive the 30 signatures from each of the 19 Dutch electoral regions it would need to get on the ballot for the 2006 and 2010 general elections. In 2010, new laws were passed to combat child pornography. The new laws made it illegal to click a hyperlink of which is can be expected that it might lead to child pornography, to attempt to meet a child with the intention of making child pornography, and owning any material that realistically depict persons appearing to be underaged, even when the subjects are in fact over 18 or the images have been digitally created or manipulated. Kamerstuk 32123-VI nr. 79  Overheid.nl > Offici√´le bekendmakingen, overheid.nl Owning material showing 'nudity in a family setting' is not illegal, neither are depictions of Cherubs, as the addition of wings deem the images unrealistic. In 2011, the first person was convicted in the Netherlands for the possession of virtual child pornography, which was 'not distinguishable from reality at first glance'. Similar laws came into effect for pornography involving animals. Prior to 2010, producing pornography with animals was not explicitly illegal in the Netherlands. In 2014, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ordered the dissolution of Union MARTIJN (Dutch: Vereniging MARTIJN), which had been striving to normalise sexual relations between adults and children and legalise child pornography since 1982.HR 18 april 2014, , NJ 2014/507, m.nt.

Overview  NASA Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt deploying an American flag on the Moon during a half phase of the Earth (photo by Eugene Cernan) Among the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth's angular diameter (1.9¬∞) is four times the Moon's as seen from Earth, although because the Moon's orbit is eccentric, Earth's apparent size in the sky varies by about 5% either way (ranging between 1.8¬∞ and 2.0¬∞ in diameter). Earth shows phases, just like the Moon does for terrestrial observers. The phases, however, are opposite; when the terrestrial observer sees the full Moon, the lunar observer sees a \\"new Earth\\", and vice versa. Earth's albedo is three times as high as that of the Moon (due in part to its whitish cloud cover), and coupled with the wider area, the full Earth glows over 50 times brighter than the full Moon at zenith does for the terrestrial observer. This Earth light reflected on the Moon's un-sunlit half is bright enough to be visible from Earth, even to the unaided eye ‚Äì a phenomenon known as earthshine. As a result of the Moon's synchronous rotation, one side of the Moon (the \\"near side\\") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the \\"far side\\", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can be seen only from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side. The Earth is seen from the lunar surface to rotate, with a period of approximately one Earth day (differing slightly due to the Moon's orbital motion). If the Moon's rotation were purely synchronous, Earth would not have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's libration, Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from the Moon, Earth traces out an approximate oval 18¬∞ in diameter. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on the Moon. As a result, near the boundary of the near and far sides of the Moon, Earth is sometimes below the horizon and sometimes above it. To be aware, although genuine photographs of the Earth viewed from the Moon exist, many from NASA, some photographs shared on social media, that are purported to be the Earth viewed from the Moon, may not be real.  Eclipses from the Moon  Earth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring. During the Apollo 15 mission, an attempt was made to use the Lunar Roving Vehicle's TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth. Terrestrial solar eclipses, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for lunar observers because the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would be barely visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object away. Lunar observers with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the Deep Space Climate Observatory, which orbits Earth at the L1 Lagrangian point in the Sun-Earth system, from Earth. In summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or syzygy.

It came out during the Third Anglo-Dutch War and is an example of wartime propaganda, seen most obviously in the ludicrous character of Haunce van Ezel, the 'Dutch lover' of the title. In the prologue, Behn challenged those critics who sabotaged her work because she was a woman.  Plot  The play is set in Madrid, where Haunce van Ezel, a foppish Dutchman, is due to have an arranged marriage with Euphemia, daughter of Don Carlo. However, Haunce does not actually arrive in Madrid until Act III - by which time Euphemia has fallen in love with Alonzo, a Flemish colonel. Alonzo had originally come to Madrid to marry Hippolyta, but like Haunce and Euphemia, the two had never met beforehand: Hippolyta's brother Marcel had arranged their planned marriage (although Marcel is mortified to discover that Hippolyta has had a sexual relationship with another cavalier, Antonio). Alonzo decides to marry Euphemia himself. When Haunce finally does arrive on the scene, various humorous incidents based on mistaken identity occur: to Don Carlo, the real Haunce and the fake Haunce seem equally ludicrous and indistinguishable. These escapades give Alonzo and Euphemia time to marry. By the end of the play, Euphemia is married to Alonzo; Hippolyta to Antoinio; and Haunce to Olinda, one of Euphemia‚Äôs maids.

During the latter, he was the German military attach√© in Italy.  Early life  Enno Emil von Rintelen was born in Stettin on 6 November 1891, the son of Prussian Army Generalleutnant Wilhelm Rintelen and his wife Hedwig Russell. The family was ennobled in 1913, and added the nobiliary particle \\"von\\" to their surname. He was initially homeschooled, then attended the Schiller-Realgymnasium in Stettin, gymnasiums in Stargard and Stralsund, the lyzeum in Strassburg, and the gymnasium in K√ºstrin.  First World War  Rintelen joined the Prussian Army and was promoted on 17 September 1910 as a fahnenjunker in the . He was promoted to unteroffizier on 27 January 1911, f√§hnrich on 23 May 1911, and leutnant on 27 January 1912, with seniority backdated to 30 January 1910. During the First World War he served on the Western and Eastern fronts. He was adjutant of the III. Battalion of the 2nd Reserve Infantry Regiment from 2 August to 24 September 1914, then ordnance officer on the staff of the 81. Reserve Infantry Brigade from 13 January to 22 August 1915. He was promoted to oberleutnant on 18 September 1915. On 13 December 1915, he joined the staff of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment, becoming adjutant on 13 January 1916, and a company commander on 15 September 1917. From 7 December 1917 to 23 May 1918, he was on the staff of the 109th Infantry Division, except from 24 January to 4 March 1918, when he commanded the 227th Field Artillery Regiment in that division. On 24 May 1918 he was posted to the staff of the XI Corps. He joined the staff of the 78th Reserve Division on 14 July, and the For his services, he was promoted to hauptmann on 18 October 1918. He was awarded both classes of the Iron Cross.  Between the wars  After the war, Rintelen was one of the officers who was retained in the Reichswehr. He married Ernina Boy-Kessler on 9 June 1920 in Stettin. The couple had a daughter and a son, Enno, who later married Countess Clotilde of Nassau-Merenberg. Rintelen was posted to the staff of ' 1 in Berlin on 1 October 1921. On 1 October 1922 he was transferred to the staff of the 6th Division in M√ºnster, and then, on 1 October 1922, to that of Gruppenkommando 2 in Kassel. On 1 October 1925, he assumed command of the 16th Company of the . On 1 October 1928, he returned to staff duties on the staff of the 2nd Cavalry Division. Promotion was slow in the inter-war years, and he was not promoted to major until 1 April 1931 (with seniority backdated to 1 October 1929). Thereafter, promotion became faster, and he was promoted to Oberstleutnant on 1 December 1933, and assumed command of the 1st Battalion of Infantry Regiment D√∂beritz on 1 October 1934. He was promoted to Oberst on 1 October 1935, and entered the '.  Second World War  On 1 October 1936, Rintelen was posted to Rome as the German military attach√© in Italy. He would remain in this post for the rest of his military career, although he was promoted to generalmajor on 1 June 1939, generalleutnant on 1 June 1941, and general der infanterie on 1 July 1942. After Italy entered the Second World War in June 1940, he became the representative of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) to the Italian High Command (Comando Supremo). As such, he was answerable to the Oberkommando des Heeres, the OKW and the Foreign Office. He learned to speak Italian fluently, and established good relationships with the Italian civil and military leadership. When German troops started moving into Italy, Rintelen exercised command over them, although operational units came under Italian tactical command. He was given the title of Deutscher General bei dem Hauptquartier der italienischen Wehrmacht (German General at the Headquarters of the Italian Armed Forces). Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring was appointed OB S√ºd in December 1941, but initially controlled only the air forces in Sicily. Rintelen was subordinated to him in October 1942, but could still communicate with the OKW directly as its representative in Italy. Despite his warm relations with the Italians, Rintelen was under no illusions about the military prowess of Italy, which he felt was exaggerated by the Nazis due to their political affinity with fascism. In May 1943, he submitted a report on combat effectiveness of the Italian armed forces, concluding that they \\"have not up to now fulfilled the missions assigned them in this war, and have actually failed everywhere.\\" He concluded that the Italians could not repel a full-scale Allied invasion of Italy without substantial German assistance. In response, OKW ordered Kesselring to reconstitute three divisions that had been destroyed in the Tunisian campaign. When the Italian government changed in July 1943, Rintelen accepted the explanation of General Vittorio Ambrosio that it would have no effect on military operations and that Italy would remain in the war as an ally of Germany. Adolf Hitler did not believe it, and used Rintelen, whom he considered an \\"Italophile\\", as cover while OKW prepared Fall Achse (Operation Axis) to disarm the Italian forces and occupy Italy. When he found out about it, Rintelen considered it a breach of faith with the Italians, and urged Kesselring to resign rather than implement it. Rintelen went to see Hitler in person. Hitler was far from convinced, and suspected Rintelen was a traitor. Nonetheless, he let him return to his post in Italy as if nothing had happened. On 1 September 1943, Rintelen was transferred to the F√ºhrerreserve and was succeeded by Rudolf Toussaint. On 31 December 1944, Rintelen retired, and was awarded the German Cross in Silver for his services. He had also been awarded the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.  Later life  Rintelen worked for the US Army's Historical Division in 1946 and 1947, writing a monograph on German-Italian Cooperation. He also wrote about his experiences in Italy in a book Mussolini als Bundesgenosse: Erinnerungen des deutschen Milit√§rattach√©s in Rom, 1936‚Äì1943 (\\"Mussolini as ally: Memoires of the German military attach√© in Rome, 1936-1943\\") (1951).

The group itself rejects this label, and states that they are primarily engaged in charitable work. The group is also involved in organizing gun rights demonstrations. The group has publicly collaborated with the John Brown Gun Club, a far-left group, although this affiliation ended in mid-2019 under disputed circumstances. Following criticisms leveled at a prominent member group during a 2019 city council election, the group announced that they had split from the paramilitary national Three Percenters organization years prior.  Activities  The Washington State Three Percenters were formed as an offshoot of the paramilitary Patriot movement. Founded by Matt Marshall, the group denies being a paramilitary group and has stated that their primary activities are engaging in charitable and emergency preparedness work. Activities in this vein have included raising money for civil infrastructure and homeless veterans. The group also regularly organizes gun rights rallies, and has been a vocal supporter of Washington State Republican politician Matt Shea. In January 2019, the Washington State Three Percenters coordinated with the Puget Sound chapter of the John Brown Gun Club, to oppose racist flyering conducted by White Supremacist group Patriot Front, following several months of having engaged in dialogue at rallies. The groups ended their collaborative efforts in July 2019. According to the John Brown Gun Club, this split was due to the Three Percenters' support for Matt Shea and concerns about the group's continuing affiliation with far-right individuals and media. According to the Three Percenters, the primary cause for the split was insensitive comments made by some of their membership following the 2019 ICE firebombing attack in Tacoma, which had been perpetrated by a former member of the John Brown Gun Club. According to Marshall, \\"The true neo-Nazis hate us, which they should because we hate them too, and the far left, who we don't have any problems with, hate us because they believe that we're neo-Nazis\\". During an election in 2019, Washington State Democrats issued a statement against Chris Wisnoski, a prominent member of the Three Percenters and then-incumbent city council member in Black Diamond, describing the group as a far right militia. The Three Percenters denied that they were a militia, and claimed to have severed ties with the national Three Percenters organization years prior. On June 27, 2020 the Washington State Three Percenters held a rally in Olympia named \\"March for Our Rights\\". Sacha Baron Cohen crashed the event disguised as a country singer, and attempted to lead the crowd in a racist singalong with mixed results, with some audience member singing along, but others being hostile, and driving him off the stage. Organizers of the rally accused Baron Cohen of gaining their trust by financially sponsoring the event. It was reported that after leaving, Baron Cohen came back to the event disguised as a cameraman.

Putnam's Sons. Warcross is the first book in the duology of the same name. Unlike Lu's previous two trilogies, which were dystopian novels, Warcross is a science fiction novel. Moreover, it takes place in a contemporary steampunk setting in New York and Tokyo. The sequel to Warcross, Wildcard, was released September 18, 2018. The novel focuses on 18-year-old Emika Chen who, after losing her father and being expelled from high school, turns to Warcross to escape from her hardships. To make a living, she becomes a bounty hunter‚Äîan individual who tracks down perpetrators of crimes related to Warcross, such as gambling. During an internationally televised Warcross match, Emika manages to glitch into the middle of the action, which establishes her as a household name afterwards. As a result, the creator of the game, Hideo Tanaka, invites her to Tokyo for a job offer. As Emika accepts the job offer, she becomes entangled in a struggle between a hacker known as Zero and Hideo, which puts the future of Warcross at stake. Warcross was commercially successful and received generally positive reviews. After its release, the novel appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list in the young adult category where it remained for 12 weeks. The novel received mostly positive reviews with reviewers praising the seamless transition between plot elements. However, some critics took exception to the predictability of some of the plot elements and the shallow relationship between Emika and Hideo. It was announced in September 2020 that the book rights had been optioned for a TV adaption by Bruna Papandrea's Made Up Stories and John Cameron (Fargo, Legion). Development and inspiration Before releasing her debut novel Legend in 2011, Lu worked briefly as an intern at Disney Interactive Studios. In the creation process of Warcross, she took particular inspiration from League of Legends tournaments, stating that \\"fifty thousand people will pack into the Staples Center to watch the world championships, and that very much influenced the creation of Warcross.\\" For the structure of the Warcross game, Lu compares it to \\"a mix between Overwatch, Mario Kart, and Quidditch\\". Lu's characterization of the main protagonist was inspired by her mother's computer skills as a computer scientist, perseverance and determination; however, Lu concedes that Emika shares the same interests and flaws as her. Plot 18-year old Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter for a living, which entails capturing individuals who are suspected of betting on Warcross, the largest internet game in the world, in which players access a virtual-reality world by wearing a pair of glasses‚Äîthe Neuro Link‚Äî and battle on realistic terrains by using power-ups to take their opponent's Artifact (a gem). While on the hunt for a suspect, Emika is reminded of the upcoming Warcross tournament in Tokyo. During the first Warcross tournament match, a rare power-up appears. This particular power-up sells for a hefty amount of money, which compels Emika to exploit a vulnerability in the code. Upon using the hack, she glitches into the middle of tournament match, which confuses both teams and leads to the cancellation of the match. After her unexpected intrusion, Emika rises to stardom. She receives a call from Henka Games, informing her that the game's creator, Hideo Tanaka, intends to fly her out to Tokyo to discuss a job opportunity. Hideo informs Emika that Warcross has been suffering from the actions of a mysterious hacker, known as Zero, who has managed to enter Warcross' database and access the information of all the spectators at the tournament. Hideo offers her a position as a bounty hunter so that she could help him capture the elusive hacker. Hideo suspects that the hacker is likely a competitor in the tournament. Thus, he signs Emika up for the tournament so that she could spy on her competitors without raising suspicion. In the Wardraft, where wildcards are drafted into teams, Emika is the first player picked, and joins Team Phoenix Riders. Emika becomes wary of one of her teammates, a wildcard called DJ Ren, who has set up a system of shields to encrypt his information. Emika extracts a string of code from the shield, which Hideo suggests is related to the Dark World, a place where people do illegal things through Warcross. There, Emika stumbles upon Ren placing small bets and conversing with an ominous figure, known as Zero. Since the bets are so small, Emika believes them to be a set of coordinates that map out future attacks against Henka Games. After Emika's team wins their first match, the stadium is plunged into darkness. Emika, fearing that something is amiss, sends a message to Hideo, warning him of a possible attack against him. Hideo escapes unscathed from the attack; however, his colleagues suggest that he should leave Tokyo to avoid further incidents, which he downplays. Emika meets up with him in an attempt to change his convictions; however, Hideo remains steadfast. Nevertheless, he reveals that he has developed feelings for Emika and as a result, Hideo discloses that the disappearance of his younger brother, Sasuke, brought about the creation of Warcross. At the start of the next Warcross game, Emika decides to trail Ren; however, Zero suddenly appears in front of her. He offers her an opportunity to work with him to thwart Hideo's plans. She rejects his offer, which makes Zero threaten her about the repercussions of her decision. As the match concludes, images of Emika with Hideo emerge, which stirs the media into a frenzy. When she arrives at her team's dormitory, her teammates Asher, Hammie, and Roshan are furious with her actions. Although they press her for details, Emika keeps mum to avoid divulging her secrets. As she walks away from her teammates, an explosion erupts that levels the dormitory. Emika wakes up in a hospital to find herself surrounded by some of her teammates. As she turns on the television, she finds out that she and Ren have been disqualified from the tournament. Simultaneously, Hideo pays her a visit and informs her that her contract has concluded. Hideo agrees to pay her the sum that he offered for the bounty, but he implores her not to meddle in the Warcross finals. A member from a rival team, Tremaine, sends Emika a video wherein Zero and Ren discuss wreaking havoc on the finals by placing bugged power-ups around the map. Undeterred by Hideo's demands, Emika decides to intervene to stymie a disaster. With the funds from the bounty, Emika buys some power-ups that will help her team win the championship without touching the bugged power-ups. Emika manages to glitch into another tournament match. She deploys the power-ups, which eventually lead her team to victory. As the game concludes, Zero spawns into the map. He vaguely warns Emika of the dangers of Hideo's plans without going into further details. Emika meets up with Hideo once again and he divulges the true intentions of Warcross. He mentions that the new contact lenses used as alternative for the glasses interact with the user's brain, thus he will be able to stop individuals who plan on committing a crime. These revelations leave Emika distraught and she questions the purpose of Warcross altogether. After the meeting, Emika receives a text from Zero, who extends his previous offer to her. She reviews footage from the final and discovers a vulnerability in Zero's code. She learns that Zero turns out to be Sasuke, Hideo's long lost brother. Reception Warcross received mostly positive reviews from critics. In her list of the best science fiction books to read in September 2017, Everdeen Mason praised the novel for its quickly developing plot and entertainment value. Moreover, she argued that the novel transcends its young-adult billing, likening it to Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. Kirkus praised the novel for the romance between Emika and Hideo and the plot which captures the feel of an action movie. Kirkus included Warcross in its list of the best teen science fiction books of 2017. Warcross was nominated for Goodreads' Best Young Adult and Science Fiction Award in 2017 where it garnered 16,000 votes, placing 7th out of 20. Feliza Casano of Tor.com was critical in her review of Warcross, citing the monotony of the plot as a hindrance to the overall story. In particular, she took exception with the romance between Emika and Hideo and the disclosure of Zero's identity, believing that these plot elements were too easy to foretell.

Even poor students were fond of different disputes and conversations about famous masterpieces and legacy of important figures of Russian and foreign literature. The other things the children enjoyed were stories and narrations about the sights and museums of Leningrad. As Rina Zariova noticed, every Tatar family was used to subscribe for more than 30 printed publications of region in this years. Rina Zaripova recalled sooner, one day of her working students of high classes shared the —Åolumn \\"Confidante\\" of \\"Youth of Tatarstan\\" to her.

The readers could often find in this \\"Saturday section\\" the notes of songs according to their permissions, sent with the plenties of letters. Many of the most favourite songs were after Tatar composer Sara Sadƒ±qova. Due to this fact, Rina Zaripova needed for a long time to work with this composer and become her frequent guest and friend. The times were very hard not only for ordinary inhabitants of the country but also for personalities like Sara Sadƒ±qova. However, she was used to regaling her guests with different unusual for this time meals. Rina Zaripova witnessed the moments of her habit to play the piano and sing her songs.

The siege of this city was the central episode of this conflict. On September 25, the Moroccan army began to bombard the city. Since a sea attack was impossible, the bombardment's objective was to open a breach somewhere in the walls of the city and penetrate through it. The besiegers established their headquarters in the city's seraglio and installed 14 batteries. However, from the start the bombardment was not continuous since there were ongoing peace negotiations between the two countries. During the siege, Spanish forces relocated towards Ceuta to reinforce the situation there. Most of these regiments arrived in 1791 between a ceasefire and return to hostilities. The naval forces were also present in Ceuta, providing continuous communication between Ceuta and Peninsular Spain; the gunboats invented by Antonio Barcel√≥ were particularly effective. The meetings between Spanish and Moroccan representatives alternated with military confrontations until October 14, 1790, when a ceasefire was established. Sultan Yazid of Morocco proposed the suspension of hostilities to negotiate with the Spanish government in Madrid. The ceasefire would last from October 1790 to August 15, 1791. During these negotiations, the two countries took advantage of the ceasefire to resupply their troops and increase their forces. The Moroccan sultan tried to achieve the surrender of Ceuta and some minor garrisons, or a monetary payment in exchange for peace. Charles IV refused these terms and formally declared war on Morocco, restarting the conflict on August 15, 1791. The besieged noticed that the batteries were not guarded by a large garrison while the city was not being bombarded and organized an escape on August 25. The offensive was carried out in conjunction with the navy, which escorted land forces that left the city to cause massive damage to the Moroccan batteries. In response, the Moroccans launched a major offensive against the city's walls on August 30, when 8,000 men accompanied by the siege batteries attempted unsuccessfully to enter the city. On September 14, following the directions of the Sultan, Sharif Ali asked to negotiate with the governor of Ceuta as he faced low morale within his ranks. In addition to demoralization, he faced a massive economic cost associated with the siege, and an uprising by the Sultan's brothers who disputed the throne. The Moroccan troops began to retreat in the next days and the city was no longer under bombardment. However, a large part of the artillery in position was not withdrawn. Facing this refusal to withdraw them, the Spanish left twice during September and October, causing skirmishes and casualties on both sides. The skirmishes around the areas used by the besiegers would continue until the signing of a peace treaty.  References   Bibliography  * Carmona Portillo, Antonio.

Biography  Jean Rupp was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 13 October 1905. He entered the Saint Sulpice Seminary of Issy-les- Moulineaux in 1928. He was ordained a priest on 31 March 1934. In 1946, in concert with Jean Larnaud, a Catholic layman, and the support of the Apostolic Nuncio to France, Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII), he founded the International Catholic Center for Cooperation with UNESCO (Centre Catholique International de Coop√©ration avec l‚ÄôUNESCO or CCIC), which launched its operations the next year. In 1947, Pope Pius XII named him to represent the Holy See to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), though as a liaison rather than a formal diplomatic role. Pope Pius XII appointed him auxiliary bishop of Paris for the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in France on 28 October 1954. Pope John XXIII named him the Bishop of Monaco on 9 June 1962 and he was enthroned there on 7 October. Rupp participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. In 1964 he addressed the Council at length on the lack of Christian solidarity demonstrated in failing to denounce the Armenian Genocide. On 8 May 1971, Pope Paul VI named him Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Iraq, raising him to the rank of archbishop, and then added the title Pro-Nuncio to Kuwait on 4 March 1975. On 13 July 1978, a month before his death, Paul VI appointed Rupp the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva. He retired from this post on 5 July 1980 and Edoardo Rovida succeeded him in this post on 7 March 1981. In 1980, when Rupp turned 75, the standard age for a prelate to retire from active ministry, Pope John Paul II named him a canon of the Basilica of St. Mary Major. Rupp died in Rome on 28 January 1983 and was buried in that basilica on 31 January.

The fortress was conquered by the Almohads in 1132. Some archeological excavations were carried out in the 20th century, but many of the remains of the fortifications have been used for local building projects. Location and history Tasgh√Æm√ªt is about south-east of Marrakesh. At one time it dominated the ancient capital of Aghmat. The site, which also has evidence of Neolithic occupation, resembles Jebel Mudawwar, as an oval, rocky plateau cut through by ravines, overlooking a surrounding plain. Like Jebel Mudawwar it has defensive lines that follow the topography, as well as dams, and one of its inhabited areas is singled out for a privileged occupant. The fortifications were built on order of Ali ibn Yusuf, and were made of rammed earth, not masonry, indicating that they were constructed with expedience at a time when the Almoravid dynasty was threatened by the Almohad Caliphate. It was conquered by the Almohads in 1132, and Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min had the wooden gates removed, to be installed at Tinmel. The fortress was built on a plateau with an altitude of , some sixty years after the construction of a fortress in Marrakesh, whose remains are on the perimeter of the first Koutoubia Mosque; their discovery in 1948 led Charles Allain and Jacques Meuni√© to study Tasgh√Æm√ªt. A defensive wall long was completed by 1125. Most defensive buildings are oriented toward the west, the most vulnerable side. These include a large bastion named Bab Gh√¢dir, whose remains are still there, and a tower on the southernmost side. The wall was around thick, and featured a total of 15 rectangular bastions, overhanging the wall. The complex was accessed through a gate in the north-west called the Bab el Mohaddin (\\"Gate of the Almohads\\"); nearby was a kasbah which had living quarters, storage rooms, an arsenal, and the living quarters for the garrison's chief. Recent history, archeology Archeological investigations of the site were published in 1927, 1951, and 1999. The first one, by Henri Basset and Henri Terrasse, was started in 1923 and the results were published in 1927 (no excavations were carried out). Since no masonry was used and the buildings were all executed in a simple and unadorned manner, they concluded that the fortress was quickly constructed, though the surface area indicated that a large garrison must have been stationed here. After the discovery of the fort at Koutoubia, a second study at Tasgh√Æm√ªt was begun in 1949, led by Charles Allain and Jacques Meuni√©. First they studied the terrain, and 1951 they began excavating the most important buildings: the gates, the western bastion, and parts of the kasbah. Their study was published in 1951. They remarked that the plateau must have seen a lot of traffic already before the Almohads: flint tools and a polished axe from the Neolithic were found close to a now-dry spring. Since their investigation, much of the stone material has been hauled off to serve local building needs.

It was released on 13 July 2007 by Rec by Saatci. It was her first and only album to be released by this company. Content Ufuk Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m served as the album's arranger, while G√ºl≈üen and Ercan Saat√ßi wrote and composed the songs. For its first music video, G√ºl≈üen chose \\"Kara B√∂c√ºkler\\", a song which features ironic elements. Two other music videos were made for the songs \\"E Bilemem Artƒ±k\\" and \\"Su Gibi Ge√ßerdi Zaman\\", the first of which ranked second on Turkey's official music chart. Criticism The album's graphic design was criticized due to its similarities to Jessica Stam's photos taken by Mert Ala≈ü and Marcus Piggott for a fashion shoot titled \\"Travel\\". Director Deniz Akel also claimed that the concept for G√ºl≈üen's music video \\"Karab√∂c√ºkler\\" was nearly identical to the one she had shot for Atiye's music video \\"Beyaz E≈üya\\". In \\"Karab√∂c√ºkler\\", G√ºl≈üen throws pirate printed CD covers and her mobile phone, which is full of messages sent by hypocrites, in a washing machine and ends up with the album cover for Ama Bir Farkla, while in Atiye's music video she throws a man inside a washing machine, both symbolizing the act of washing unwanted things away. In response to the criticism, G√ºl≈üen stated that the album's main design was the idea of the photographer who, under the inspiration of Mert Ala≈ü's work, had thought that the concept would only suit G√ºl≈üen out of the Turkish artists, though she added that she would not have allowed this to happen had she known of the similarities in the first place. In regards to the music video, she mentioned that the whole concept was S√ºleyman Y√ºksel's idea, to emphasize on getting rid of things that make life difficult for the people such as fake news and messages. For her second music video, \\"E Bilemem Artƒ±k\\", a studio at Om Plato in Mecidiyek√∂y was turned into a botanical forest. In the video, which was shot by Tamer Aydoƒüdu, a variety of different animals from ≈ûile Zoo, including iguanas, snakes, parrots, peacocks, pigeons, and birds, were used.

In response to the criticism, G√ºl≈üen joked that she keeps \\"her beloved close to [herself]\\".

He praised the cockpit size, cabin and the handling, but faulted the high prices the used boats fetch, the lack of cabin top winches and lack of accessible stowage.

He was the son of count Amadeus II of Geneva, and Agn√®s, daughter of John, Count of Chalon. Biography William was the oldest son of the Count of Geneva, Amadeus II, and Agn√®s de Chalon, daughter of Jean I of Chalon from the House of Ivrea. He was born in the Region of Savoy-Maurienne, he had two other brothers Hugues, a layman, and Am√©d√©e who will become bishop of Toul from 1320 to 1330. His sister Jeanne married Guichard VI of Albon, nicknamed LeGrand, lord of Beaujeuet, his other sister Marie, married Jean II de Chalon-Arlay son of John I of Chalon-Arlay (1259-1316). In 1291, his father signed a peace treaty with the Counts of Savoy, to strengthen the family status by an alliance between the two families, William was betrothed into marrying a daughter of the Counts of Savoy. Thus William must marry Agn√®s, the daughter of Am√©d√©e V. The contract is signed at the castle Saint-Georges-d'Esp√©ranche of the counts of Savoy, on August 31, 1297. By this agreement, the Count of Savoy gives 10,000 gold-pounds in dowry and the castle of La Corbi√®re to load tribute and on condition that the forces of the Count of Geneva prevent any attack, and that the family of Geneva brings 4,000 gold-pounds and the bridge in front of the castle to his son, with the castles of Rumilly in Abanais, Hauteville, Alby, Charousse as guarantee as well as other pledges. Family and descendants In 1297, married Agnes of Savoy, daughter of Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, with issue: * Amadeus was born March 29, 1311, who will succeed William. * Marguerite ; * Yolande, who married in 1348 , Count of Clermont. William also had an illegitimate son with Emeraude de La Frasse, lady of Montjoie: * Pierre, called \\"Bastard of Geneva\\", he married Catherine of Ternier, daughter of the lord of Ternier; originating the younger branch of Geneva-Lullin and Geneva-Boringe. Reign period William III accession to the throne, his father Count Amadeus, establishes his will at the castle of La Balme, September 24, 1306. In this act, he designates him as his successor and specifies that these brothers, Am√©d√©e and Hugues, will receive the castles of Varey, Mornex, , Rumilly-sous-Cornillon, and Cornillon, for the vicedominus des Bornes, for the rights on the market of La Roche, and for the lands and rents which he possesses in Vaud, all under the condition that they will be able to alienate these castles and rights only in favor of the heirs of Count. His father dies on May 22, 1308, near the Vuache castle. The actual entry in function of Count William III is not known, Pierre Duparc gives the hypothesis of Jules Vuy who considered that the new count became sometime before the death of Amadeus. This observation is based on the analysis of a charter, not original, of 1308. The historian Matthieu de la Corbi√®re; however, indicates \\"by a transaction concluded on May 29, his eldest son Guillaume took over\\". The succession raises certain concerns, especially between the young count and his mother, Agnes of Chalon. In 1306, during the writing of the will, William was a minor and therefore a regency by his mother had been anticipated, two years later, the young count is of age to direct. A transaction is set up between the two parties, on May 29, 1308, by the executor, Jean I of Chalon-Arlay, brother of Agnes, and under the auspices of the Bishop of Geneva. Three years later, a new transaction is established in favor of the count by Jean de Chalon and reducing the share of inheritance of his mother, forcing him to renounce all claims on the county. In exchange, the count undertakes to defend the possessions of his mother. This act is guaranteed in February in particular by the Dauphin John II of Viennois, the son of the count Savoy Edward and Guichard VI de Beaujeu. The reign of William III most likely was influenced by his wife from the house of Savoy, the new count commits to the path of peace with the Count of Savoy. At the peace treaty between the Count of Savoy and the Great Dauphine B√©atrice of August 1308, William \\"vouches for his execution\\". On October 23, 1308, he signs with Count Amadeus V, a treaty of perpetual peace at the castle of Saint- Georges-d'Esp√©ranche. The treaty is an opportunity for William to recognize that he holds \\"in fief of the Count of Savoy the castles and jurisdictions of , Alby, Hauteville, and La Corbi√®re, as well as all that the lords of Gr√©sy, Cessens, and Arnaud de Grandmont hold of him in Geneva ¬ª. He also ratifies past agreements, including the peace of Annemasse from 1287 or the arbitral award of 1293 passed with William, bishop of Lausanne, and Aimon of Quart. Finally, on January 21, 1312, the sons of the count of Savoy, √âdouard and Aymon, sign an agreement committing the various parties to divide the barony of Faucigny, in case of death without heir of Lord Hugues. An event in April 1312 commits the signatories of the agreement to intervene. A vassal of Baron de Faucigny, Guillaume-Albi Lucinge, commits a murder, the lords of Savoy and Geneva intervene by taking the castle Lucinges and destroy. The count, resumed his old alliance, with the Dauphin of Viennois, the bishops of Geneva and Lausanne. He also pays tribute to the Dauphin of Viennois, recognizing holding in fief his county and various castles of this lord, June 13, 1316. Death and succession, on April 11, 1319, Count William establishes his will at the castle of Annecy naming heir his son Am√©d√©e. In the event that his son disappears, he makes his brothers, Hugues and Am√©d√©e his successors. In his will, he leaves a rent to his brothers, his mother, Agn√®s of Chalon, and his wife Agn√®s of Savoy, his dowry and the Valley of the Keys and the castle of Charousse. The act is supplemented by donations to the Church and its institutions.

She was last seen at the beauty school she attended in Wenatchee, Washington. Her body was discovered on the banks of the Columbia River four days later on February 13, 2010. A post-mortem examination determined she had been strangled, stabbed in the neck, and had suffered blunt force trauma to the head. After an extensive investigation, police implicated 29-year-old Christopher Scott Wilson ‚Äì a beauty school classmate of Cowell's ‚Äì in her death. Police began to suspect Wilson after several people came forward claiming that he had a fascination with death and serial killers. Wilson was arrested after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene. Police later found Cowell's blood in his apartment. In a plea agreement, Wilson pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to just over 14 years in prison. Wilson later attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, stating that he only accepted the plea agreement because he felt he would not have received a fair trial. He remains imprisoned in Washington and will be eligible for parole in 2023. Background and disappearance Mackenzie Cowell was 17 years old at the time of her disappearance. She lived in Orondo, Washington and was a senior at Wenatchee High School, where she was a member of the school dance team. She also worked as a model and studied cosmetology at the Wenatchee Academy of Hair Design in downtown Wenatchee. Cowell went missing shortly after 3:00p.m. on February 9, 2010. She was last seen on surveillance video leaving the Academy of Hair Design, walking to her car and driving away. She had told classmates that she would be back in less than 15 minutes. Around this time, she sent a text message to her boyfriend that said, \\"Hey, what's up\\". This was the last time she is known to have used her phone. Cowell's father attempted to contact her at around 5:40p.m., but his calls went straight to voicemail. Her family became increasingly concerned after Mackenzie missed her 8p.m. curfew. Later that night, a homeowner in remote Chelan County reported an abandoned car near his driveway. Police traced the car's registration to Cowell's father, who informed them Mackenzie was missing. The car was located near Mission Ridge, about from her home in Orondo. Cowell's purse and some clothes were found in the car, although her debit card and cell phone were missing. According to police, only one pair of footprints was found at the scene. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office began the investigation into Cowell's disappearance by using a helicopter to search the area near where her car was found. Search warrants were issued for Cowell's phone records and social media activity. At the request of the sheriff, the FBI was called in to assist with the investigation. Discovery of body and autopsy On the afternoon of February 13, Cowell's body was discovered on the banks of the Columbia River near Quincy, Washington, at a resort community about away from Wenatchee. She was found fully clothed, with her feet in the water. A vacant house for sale was located about from where her body was found. An autopsy determined the cause of death had been strangulation and stab wounds to the neck. Cowell also suffered blunt force trauma to the head. The killer had apparently attempted to cut off one of her arms after her death. A knife was found, still stuck into her shoulder. Investigators found no evidence that Cowell had been sexually assaulted. On February 25, around 1,800 people attended a memorial service for Cowell, which was held at the Town Toyota Center in Wenatchee. Investigation The investigation was headed by the Mackenzie Cowell Task Force, a multi-agency police group assembled after the recovery of Cowell's body. The task force included law enforcement agents from the cities of Wenatchee and East Wenatchee, and from the counties of Chelan and Douglas. An FBI agent and two officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also assisted the task force. The case was the largest multi-agency investigation in the Wenatchee area since an attempted serial bombing in 1997. Police interviewed over 800 people throughout the course of the investigation. Police initially looked into Cowell's boyfriend, Joaquin Villasano; as well as her mother's boyfriend, Joey Fisher. According to police, Villasano had failed a polygraph when asked if he knew what happened to Cowell. Fisher had allegedly gotten into a big argument with Cowell the day before she went missing. However, both Villasano and Fisher were later completely cleared by police. The next lead in the case came from Liz Reid, a college student, police informant and former drug dealer. Reid told police that two drug dealers, Sam Cuevas and Emmanuel Cerros, had murdered Cowell in a case of mistaken identity. The two had supposedly believed Cowell was an informant. Reid claims she saw a snuff film of the murder, and that Cuevas admitted to her: \\"'I choked that bitch to shut her up\\". Reid was able to describe the murder weapon before it was made public, and gave police a ring which she claimed had belonged to Cowell. She said Cerros had sent her to the murder site to find the ring. None of Cowell's family members recognized the ring as belonging to Mackenzie. Reid later retracted her claim of seeing a video of the murder. As a result, police began to question Reid's credibility. Cuevas and Cerros were interviewed by police and produced alibis, witness statements and phone records placing them elsewhere on the day of Cowell's disappearance. =Christopher Scott Wilson= After receiving several tips, police began to focus the investigation on Christopher Scott Wilson, a 29-year-old classmate of Cowell's at the Academy of Hair Design. Police received a letter in August which claimed that Wilson had an \\"obsession with death, dead bodies and serial killers\\". One of Wilson's classmates told police that Wilson had said he used to work in funeral homes and that he \\"liked to cut people up\\". On October 6, Wilson was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and held on US$1 million bail. DNA found on duct tape near where Cowell's body was discovered linked Wilson to the crime. According to investigators, Wilson left the beauty school shortly after Cowell did on the day she disappeared. Three witnesses reported seeing a man matching Wilson's description near where her car had been abandoned. A search of Wilson's apartment revealed the presence of blood which matched Cowell's DNA. In December, the Cowell task force made a second arrest. Wilson's friend Tessa M. Schuyleman was accused of‚Äîbut never charged with‚Äîhelping Wilson to conceal the crime. She was instead charged with obstruction of justice for an unrelated case. Detectives claimed that many photos were found on Wilson's computer of Schuyleman \\"posing as a dead person\\" on the spot in Wilson's apartment where Cowell's blood was found. Schuyleman claims she had no knowledge of the blood stain and that Wilson had told her to pose there. Trial Prosecutors upgraded Wilson's charge from second-degree to first-degree murder in April 2011, stating that his actions constituted premeditation. If convicted, he would face a sentence of 20 to 26 years in prison. Before the trial began, Wilson rejected a plea deal in which he would have received a prison sentence of about six and a half years in exchange for pleading guilty to first-degree manslaughter. Wilson's defense team was led by John Henry Browne, a prominent Seattle attorney who had previously represented high-profile defendants such as Ted Bundy and Colton Harris Moore. Browne intended to argue that Cowell's blood had been planted in Wilson's apartment. According to Browne, more blood should have been found at the apartment, given the violent nature of Cowell's death. The presiding judge ruled that the defense would be allowed to present evidence implicating Cuevas and Cerros as the killers. The judge also ruled that the prosecution would not be allowed to bring up Wilson's work history at area funeral homes, his tattoo of Hannibal Lecter, or his online activity on DeviantArt and on serial killer forums. After jury selection for the trial had begun, Wilson accepted a new plea deal. He pleaded guilty to the first-degree manslaughter of Mackenzie Cowell, as well as first-degree robbery for taking her cell phone and second-degree assault for an unrelated case. He was sentenced to 14 years and 3 months in prison. Wilson would later maintain his innocence, stating that he only pleaded guilty because he did not believe he would receive a fair trial. According to Wilson, around 80% of juror candidates answered questionnaires stating either that they believed Wilson was guilty or that they had knowledge of evidence which was ordered to be suppressed at trial. Wilson filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, but the motion was rejected by the Washington Court of Appeals. He is imprisoned at Clallam Bay Corrections Center and is scheduled to be eligible for parole in 2023.

Almost every Saturday it would host an event. Its amateur theater staged some 100 different plays up to 1915 when the city was occupied by the Germans during World War I. Its choir and a string orchestra organized various concerts while educational lectures were delivered by prominent figures in Lithuanian culture. The society maintained a small library, but it was destroyed during the war. The society was abolished by the Ober Ost officials but was reestablished in 1917. Faced with post-war difficulties and frequently changing leadership, it was not very active and was officially dissolved in 1923. History =Establishment= The Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904 and the ban on organizing various clubs and societies was lifted due to the Russian Revolution of 1905. Lithuanians, active in the Lithuanian National Revival, began organizing cultural and educational societies (for example, Daina Society in Kaunas or ≈Ωiburys Society in the Suwa≈Çki Governorate). Activists in ≈†iauliai submitted a proposal for a cultural Viltis Society (hope) in 1905, but it was rejected by the Tsarist authorities as its program was deemed too broad. The decision was appealed and the revised statute was approved in September 1908. The founding meeting took place on 28 September. It elected the first board (chairman Kazimieras Venclauskis, secretary Stanislava Bogu≈°ytƒó-Skipitienƒó, treasurer Antanas Povylius) and admitted the first 55 members. In 1909, Antanas Mik≈°eviƒçius became the chairman. In 1911, the society had 152 members. =Activities= Actors of the historical opera about Pilƒónai (1910) The society was known for its many amateur theater performances. Its first play was a historical drama about the Grand Duke Kƒôstutis by Adam Asnyk. The society had four theater directors ‚Äì (wife of Kazimieras Venclauskis), Jonas Misius, , and Gabrielius Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis. They staged various plays, including The Bear by Anton Chekhov, plays by Herman Heijermans, Leo Tolstoy, Jerzy ≈ªu≈Çawski, Eliza Orzeszkowa, Eduard von Keyserling, as well as by Lithuanian authors ‚Äì Aleksandras Fromas-Gu≈æutis, Vyd≈´nas, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Liudas Gira. The largest production was a five-act historical opera about Pilƒónai which included about 50 performers (directed by Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis in 1910). The directors competed with each other raising the quality of the productions but also resulting in conflicts. Pleirytƒó-Puidienƒó and Misius established their own troupe separate from the Varpas Society though continued to participate in its activities. The plays needed to be approved by the Tsarist censors. Since very few censors knew the Lithuanian language, approvals could take a long time. Therefore, the society often staged the plays only for its members ‚Äì such plays did not need approvals from the censors. The society also staged a few plays (e.g. a play by Marcel Gerbidon and The Power of Darkness by Leo Tolstoy) that were explicitly forbidden by the censors. The theater performances were followed by music, dances, games, etc. that would last to the early hours of the morning. The society performed not only in ≈†iauliai but also in Joni≈°kis, Kur≈°ƒónai, Radvili≈°kis, Viek≈°niai. In addition to plays, the society organized events almost every Saturday ‚Äì concerts, educational lectures on literature, theater, medicine, natural sciences, etc. Speakers included physician Petras Avi≈æonis, writers Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó-Bitƒó, Vyd≈´nas, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas. The society had a 70‚Äì80-member choir and a 20-member string orchestra that was established in collaboration with the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium. The choir performed mainly Lithuanian folk songs harmonized by Stasys ≈†imkus (who served as choir's conductor in 1912‚Äì1914) and other composers. The society also maintained a library of mainly Lithuanian publications. In 1910, it served about 50 regular readers who borrowed 493 books. The readers included poets Julius Janonis and Jonas Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas (Jovaras). In 1911, the society purchased a five-room house and renovated it ‚Äì added a stage, rooms for artists and society's library. By 1914, the society outgrew this space and was planning to rent the Kasino Theater which would have allowed the society to raise its amateur theater to a professional theater, but the plans were interrupted by World War I. =Post-war= During World War I, the society's premises with its library and archives burned down in April 1915 and the society was abolished by the Ober Ost officials who banned any societies in the occupied area. Varpas Society was reestablished in 1917 and was briefly known as the Kanklƒós Society. It was more active in 1920 when it staged an operetta by , performed plays by Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó, organized a concert by Mikas and Kipras Petrauskas and , hosted lectures by Vyd≈´nas. Proceeds from the events benefited the Lithuanian Scientific Society, ≈Ωiburƒólis, or other charitable causes. The society struggled due to post-war economic difficulties, frequently changing leadership, and competition from other cultural organizations. In 1918, the society managed to purchase a house from the retreating Germans. During the war, about 65% of buildings in ≈†iauliai were destroyed. Therefore, many other societies and organizations, including courts and hospitals, wanted to use the premises. Eventually, it was transferred to the in May 1923. Without funds to purchase another space, the society officially liquidated.

He was perhaps the first modern scholar to study Gara Medouar, and he was one of the foremost experts on the Moroccan economy and agriculture and its transformation under colonialism and after independence. Early life Pascon was a Pied-Noir, \\"of soldier and settler stock\\". He was born in Fez, Morocco, the son of an engineer of public works, from whom he inherited a love of the outdoors. Later in life he told his friend Ernest Gellner of his family history: his grandfather, he said, had been a Pied-Noir who had acquired land in Morocco after World War I but never became a successful farmer. One of his ancestors had been involved in the Rif War, and the French-Moroccan conflict of the 1950s also provoked tension. As a result of these involvements he developed \\"a lifelong devotion to the understanding and advancement of the Moroccan peasant\\"; later (in 1964) he acquired Moroccan citizenship. He became a scout when he was seven. In 1942 his father was imprisoned in Boudenib and his mother placed in Midelt for opposing the Vichy regime; Paul was placed in a boarding school until the Americans arrived in North Africa.  Career  At age 17, Pascon won a prize for a report on the Ziz and Rh√©ris rivers, and in 1951 he received his baccalaur√©at in experimental sciences from the Lyc√©e Gouraud in Rabat. He chose natural science and received his Certificat d'√©tudes sup√©rieures pr√©paratoires in 1952. In that year he also visited Gara Medouar; he wrote about his visit in a 1956 article in the journal Hesp√©ris, and it became the subject of a 1956 monograph. In 1956, Pascon was licensed in natural sciences, and sociology in 1958. After a number of administrative jobs he was hired by Institut agronomique et v√©t√©rinaire Hassan-II in 1970, where he worked until his death in a variety of functions, founding and leading units including the Department for Rural Development. His 1975 thesis was an interdisciplinary study (involving history, sociology, and geography, coupled with his own research, including archives from local families and potentates) of the Haouz province of Marrakesh; it was published in 1977, and one critic called it \\"a major step forward in North African studies. It exemplifies the depth of analysis possible when interdisciplinary techniques, indigenous sources, and a creative mind are brought to bear on a single region\\". A former communist and Marxist, he let go of those ideologies later in life. Pascon was also a research associate at Centre national de la recherche scientifique, France, and associate professor at Universit√© catholique de Louvain in Belgium.  Personal life  Paul Pascon was an atheist. Pascon's two children died during the Western Sahara War. Pascon died on 21 April 1985 in Mauritania after a car accident; he was survived by his widow. In an obituary, his friend Ernest Gellner wrote: \\"He died at the height of his powers, at a time when he was being quite exceptionally productive. His death is a human tragedy, but it is also an immeasurable loss to scholarship. He was unquestionably one of the most thorough, profound, best informed and penetrating of the students of Moroccan and North African society\\". Publications *Le Haouz de Marrakech (Rabat: Editions Marocaines et Internationales, 1977). Pascon's doctoral thesis, in two volumes; an interdisciplinary study. One critic reviewed it as if it were a drama with four main characters: the tribes, which make up the basic human component but in a great variety; the Zawaya, a religious group which also exercised considerable political power; the qaids, local chieftains whose power was structured in a kind of feudalism Pascon called ca√Ødalism; and the city of Marrakesh. *La Maison d'lligh et l'histoire sociale du Tazerwalt (Rabat: Societ√© Marocaine des Editeurs Reunis (SMER), 1984). A history of the House of Illigh, the family that controlled the area of Tazerwalt from the 17th century on. Pascon was still working on this when he died; it had taken him seventeen years to gain the confidence of the family's patriarch and be allowed access to the family archives. The posthumously published book contains five separate studies on various aspects of the family‚Äîfrom their acquisition of land and the execution of hydrological works in 1640 to 19th- century trade documentation, and an 1825 murder. *Capitalism and Agriculture in the Haouz of Marrakesh (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986). A translation of the second part of his doctoral thesis, edited by John R. Walt. It studies the history of the Haouz region before, during, and after colonialism, relying on dependency theory rather than Marxism. Land usage is the tool with which to measure how far capitalism penetrated into an agricultural, peripheral society.

Specimens for this description were collected from Port Hills near Christchurch.Urquhart, A. T. (1892b). Descriptions of new species of Araneidae. Transactions of the New Zealand Institute 24: 230-253. Independently, Eugene Simon described Periegops hirsutus in 1893, which was also the first description of the Periegops genus.Simon, E. (1893a). Histoire naturelle das araign√©es. Paris 1, 257-488. doi:10.5962/bhl.title.51973In 1935, Segestria suteria was moved to the Periegops genus by Elizabeth Bangs Bryant after examining types sent to her from the Canterbury Muesum.Bryant, E. B. (1935c). Notes on some of Urquhart's species of spiders. Records of the Canterbury Museum 4: 53-70.

Records of the Auckland Institute and Museum 3: 85-97.  Description  Like all members of the Periegops genus, P. suterii has six eyes. The carapace is a red-orange colour on the anterior end but is orange on the posterior end. The abdomen has a black brown chevron pattern. The first pair of legs are orange brown with light orange ends, the other pairs of legs are yellow brown and darker at the proximal end. Chelicerae are red brown. Male body length is 6.6 mm and female body length is 8.1 mm.  Habitat and distribution  Periegops suterii occurs in forests with well drained soil and deep leaf layers. Within these habitats, they may be found under logs, rocks and leaves. They can occur in podocarp and beech forest. P. suterii is only known to occur in Banks Peninsula and Riccarton Bush in Canterbury. Within these locations, P. suterii has a patchy distribution. The distribution of the species suggests it could be considered a relict species.Sirvid, P. J.; Zhang, Z.-Q.; Harvey, M. S.; Rhode, B. E.; Cook, D. R.; Bartsch, I.; Staples, D.

Chaetognatha, Ecdysozoa, Ichnofossils. Christchurch, Canterbury University Press.  Behaviour  Periegops suterii isn't known to build webs for prey capture, but rather web is used as drag lines and to build silk retreats. P. suterii is likely a fast moving nocturnal hunter. Females have been found with two to three males with them, which may imply that the female has a way of attracting males.

The station was known as the \\"Sound of Music\\" with a classical music format. History After filing for its construction permit on July 17, 1961, KSOM went on the air March 12, 1962, from studios and transmitter at 2126 S. Alvernon Way in Tucson, broadcasting 12 hours a day. It broadcast classical music; the licensee was Prell Enterprises, owned by Stan Prell and his father, Isador. KSOM claimed the distinction of being the first stereo FM station in southern Arizona. The station also formed a pact with KEPI in Phoenix to form the \\"Arizona FM Stereo Network\\", with combined news programming. On the night of May 4, 1963, David Paladin, the station's program director, was anchoring a late newscast at about 11:45 p.m. when he noticed a \\"big blanket of smoke\\" drift into the studio. After asking listeners to call the fire department, he signed the station off and fled the building; he would be treated for smoke inhalation. While the fire did not damage the studios, the transmitter exhaust system took in smoke and damaged the equipment, causing an estimated $35,000 in damage and taking KSOM off the air. After the fire, KSOM rebuilt its studios in the Mayer-Alameda building at 110 E. Alameda. The new studio was furnished with Schafer automation equipment, the second such installation in Arizona, which was put into service on July 22, 1963. While the transmitter remained at the former Alvernon studio site, KSOM sought to improve its coverage. In November 1964, the FCC granted a construction permit to move to 92.9 FM and change station classes from A to C, with 38,000 watts of effective radiated power; these facilities were never built. KSOM operated through most of 1965, though it twice suffered thefts at its Alvernon Way transmitter facility, in which tape recorders were stolen in May and in September. In a separate May incident, a fire destroyed $3,500 of equipment in KSOM's transmitter room. On February 15, 1966, the Federal Communications Commission dismissed KSOM's license renewal application for failure to prosecute.

Whatever happened afterward is not clear as her family gave varying stories of events that night. Martha was reported missing at 3:00 am on November 28 when no one could find her. Martha is described as a Caucasian female, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She stood approximately 4 feet 5 inches and weighed 70 pounds. She has birthmarks on her upper left chest and on the front of her right thigh, her top front teeth slightly protrude. Martha was last known to be wearing a short sleeved summer dress and/or a two piece matching bathing suit. Investigation Authorities started to search for Martha immediately following her disappearance. Areas along State Road 207 and areas in Kerri Lynn Road were searched. Nothing was found and the case started to turn cold. They never gave up hope of finding the girl. Since the day she vanished, Martha's mother believed that she was kidnapped and taken from the area. According to her, on the night of Martha's disappearance, she and the girl were at a social gathering when Martha said \\"Mom, I'm going over, I‚Äôll be back in five minutes.‚Äù She left the gathering and never returned. When Margaret noticed that a substantial amount of time passed and Martha hadn't returned, she went out looking for her. She reported her missing later on. Authorities questioned everyone in the area. Some neighbors stated that they had seen Martha walking West on Kerri Lynn Road later that night. Others also reported that they had seen a suspicious green van being driven in the area. It was the only vehicle that was not native to the area. It was apparently spotted soon after Martha left. Her brother, David Lambert gave varying stories as to what occurred that night. He once stated that he saw Martha getting into a black vehicle. Authorities said the story did not hold up. He would then go on to state that he and Martha were having dinner that night when Martha said she was going out. When he asked where, she told him it was none of his concern and she refused to divulge her destination. She left and David watched as Martha walked off into the dark. Martha's case was initially considered a runaway but authorities believe that Martha met with foul play and was likely deceased. Abduction theory Many, including Martha's mother, believed that the girl was abducted by a non-family member while outside. Authorities also suspected this and have investigated the possibility of a stranger abduction with great lengths but no clues emerged despite extensive searches and investigations. No one was ever named as her kidnapper and no one has ever been arrested in connection with her disappearance. Several possible suspects have been named in the case but there was no evidence in the case to prove that they had anything to do with her disappearance. Margaret Ann Lambert also remains hopeful that her daughter may still be alive. Many agencies online continue to classify Martha as a Non-Family Abduction case. David Lambert David Allen Lambert, the middle child of the Lambert family, and the older brother of Martha, has always been mentioned in the case. He has given many varying statements to police over the years regarding his sister's disappearance. He, at one point, stated that Martha was alive and had contacted him and was going to contact the authorities working on her case. This never occurred. Investigators have always had the belief that David was hiding something and that he knew more about Martha's disappearance than he had let on. He was approximately fourteen years old in 1985. The Confession In 2000, when David was arrested for attempting to pass a bad check, he told authorities that he was responsible for Martha's death and stated he buried her in a Coquina Mine known as \\"The Pitts\\" on Holmes Boulevard. The mine was searched but investigators did not find Martha's body. He could not be charged at that time due to lack of evidence. In 2009, he then confessed again to killing Martha. He stated that on November 27, 1985, he and Martha left the Lambert home because their parents got into a fight over burned turkey. They went to a Lil Champs Convenience store, David apparently had over $20 with him. Martha spent a little over $4 and gave him the change. He then stated that he and Martha went to the abandoned Florida Memorial College which was near the Lambert residence to play. David stated that he and Martha got into a fight because he denied Martha's request for another $20. Martha slapped David across the face and in response he pushed her. He pushed her so hard the she fell onto the ground and hit her head on a piece of metal. When David realized what had happened, he pulled Martha up and noticed a large hole in the back of her head and blood was pouring out. He called for help, hoping someone would come and help the girl. No one apparently heard him. David was scared of what his parents would do to him if they discovered what he had done to Martha so by using the broken piece of a road sign, he dug a 3-foot makeshift grave and placed Martha in the hole. He returned home. Aftermath Authorities were certain that David was telling the truth about his sister's death. He was not charged with manslaughter due to his age at the time of Martha's death and because the statute of limitations had expired by then. Martha's case was closed, but authorities have stated that the investigation can be reopened if new information comes in. Martha's mother remains convinced that Martha was kidnapped and has stated that David often tells tales to get attention. David later recanted his confession and stated he did not know what happened to Martha. He stated that he has long-standing emotional and mental problems. He‚Äôs also mentioned the possibility that Martha could still be alive Investigators and forensic teams spent two days searching the grounds where the college once stood but could not find Martha's body. Construction and demolition of the area in the years proceeding her disappearance may have moved the grave. Martha has never been recovered. Authorities hope to find her and have since collected DNA samples and entered them into NamUs. Her dental records have also been coded and entered into the National databases. There's still hope that Martha's case can be solved and that she can be recovered.

Production history Ironclads was one of the eight inaugural games published by Yaquinto Games in 1979. Players and reviewers quickly pointed out many errors in the rules, and a revised set of rules was immediately produced. Gameplay Ironclads is a game that simulates naval warfare between ironclads during the American Civil War, such as to the 1862 Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack. Each ship in the game has its own unique blend of armament and armor. During combat, guns on a ship are fired individually, and the result of each is resolved before the next gun is fired. Most scenarios are presented as a two-ship combat, although one scenario is a solitaire game, and several present multiplayer fleet engagements. Most two-player games last about an hour. Reception In the December 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue #32), Tim Kask called the game \\"an exciting, accurate simulation of naval warfare during the American Civil War\\" but commented at length on the problems with the rules: \\"In terms of coherence, cohesion, completeness and clarity, the rules are the pits. It is obvious that... corners were cut [that] involved editing and proofreading. Ironclad‚Äôs rules are rife with misspellings, typos, [and] mistakes... This doesn‚Äôt really become apparent until you try to play out the introductory scenario. If you follow their lead, you will promptly proceed to run aground.\\" However, Kask believed \\"the fact it manages transcend these problems is tribute to the soundness of design.\\" Kask highly recommended Ironclads, branding it \\"one of the best releases of the year.\\" Awards Ironclads was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for \\"Best Initial Release of 1979\\".

It's a restricted version of the Deutsch‚ÄìJozsa algorithm where instead of distinguishing between two different classes of functions, it tries to learn a string encoded in a function. The Bernstein‚ÄìVazirani algorithm was designed to prove an oracle separation between complexity classes BQP and BPP.  Problem statement  Given an oracle that implements a function f\\\\colon\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n\\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} in which f(x) is promised to be the dot product between x and a secret string s \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n modulo 2, f(x) = x \\\\cdot s = x_1s_1 + x_2s_2 + \\\\cdots + x_ns_n, find s.  Algorithm  Classically, the most efficient method to find the secret string is by evaluating the function n times where x = 2^{i}, i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\\\\\\\} : \\\\begin{align} f(1000\\\\cdots0_n) & = s_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(0100\\\\cdots0_n) & = s_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(0010\\\\cdots0_n) & = s_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(0000\\\\cdots1_n) & = s_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} In contrast to the classical solution which needs at least n queries of the function to find s, only one query is needed using quantum computing. The quantum algorithm is as follows: Apply a Hadamard transform to the n qubit state 0\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes n} to get :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\\\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} x\\\\rangle. Perform a controlled negation of every state in the superposition generated by the previous Hadamard transformation for which the oracle when applied to this state returns 1. This transforms the superposition into :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2^{n}}}\\\\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{f(x)} x\\\\rangle. Another Hadamard transform is applied to each qubit which makes it so that for qubits where s_i = 1, its state is converted from -\\\\rangle to 1\\\\rangle and for qubits where s_i = 0, its state is converted from +\\\\rangle to 0\\\\rangle . To obtain s, a measurement on the Standard basis (\\\\\\\\{0\\\\rangle, 1\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}) is performed on the qubits. Graphically algorithm may be represented by the following diagram: Scheme of the algorithm Where H^{\\\\otimes n} is the Hadamard transform.

The European Union‚ÄìMercosur free trade agreement is a free trade agreement on which the EU and Mercosur reached agreement in principle in 2019. The deal was announced at the 2019 G20 Osaka summit after twenty years of negotiations. Although there is agreement in principle, the final texts have not been finalised, signed or ratified and therefore has not entered into force. If ratified, it would represent the largest trade deal struck by both the EU and Mercosur in terms of citizens involved. The trade deal is part of a wider Association Agreement between the two blocs, currently under negotiation. Background Member states of Mercosur Dark green: full member states Blue: acceding future members Red: suspended members The agreement came after twenty years of negotiation. Talks began in 1999 but stalled before regaining momentum in 2016. Talks had foundered for years due to opposition from European beef producers, especially small farmers who feared being undercut on price by imports from Brazil, the world's biggest beef producer. Many governments in South America at this time preferred \\"south-south co-operation\\" to developing ties with Europe, while European governments similarly had other priorities. The growing use of protectionist policies by national leaders is considered to have spurred the renewal of talks in 2016. The EU may be hoping that the deal represents a significant break in this global renewal of protectionism. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker cited the deal as an endorsement of \\"rules-based trade\\" in a time of growing protectionism. Mercosur may be hoping to use the deal as a model for future deals going forward. Mercosur's presidents have already stated that they want to reach trade agreements with Canada and the EFTA. Argentina's president Mauricio Macri has said that the agreement with the EU is \\"not a point of arrival but of departure\\". The EU is already Mercosur's largest trading and investment partner. 20.1% of the trade bloc's exports went to the EU in 2018. Mercosur exports to the EU were worth ‚Ç¨42.6 billion in that year, while EU exports to the Mercosur countries were worth ‚Ç¨45 billion. Mercosur's biggest exports to EU countries are agricultural products such as food, beverages and tobacco, vegetable products including soya and coffee, and meat and other animal products. Europe's biggest exports to Mercosur include machinery, transport equipment, and chemical and pharmaceutical products. The EU exported ‚Ç¨23 billion worth of services to the South American trade bloc in 2017 while about ‚Ç¨11 billion worth of services came from Mercosur into Europe. Despite the value of the trading, significant tariffs remain in place, meaning potential expansion of markets should these tariffs be removed. The EU wants more access for its manufactured goods especially cars, which face tariffs of 35%, and more access to contracts for its firms and wine and cheese to sell. The primary aim of the Mercosur countries is to boost sales of farm commodities. Features Member states of the European Union The combined population of the two regions means that the deal would involve a population of 780 million. It is the largest free trade deal agreed by Mercosur since the bloc's launch in 1991. It also represents the EU's largest trade deal to date in terms of tariff reduction. For Mercosur the deal eliminates 93% of tariffs to the EU and grants ‚Äúpreferential treatment‚Äù for the remaining 7%. The deal will allow increased access to the European market for Mercosur's agricultural goods, notably beef, poultry, sugar and ethanol. The deal will likely also be good for Brazilian juice exporters and Argentine fish exporters. The deal will also remove 91% of tariffs on EU exports to the Mercosur countries. According to the Financial Times, ‚Äúsome of the most important wins for Europe include the slashing of duties on cars and car parts, chemicals, machinery and textiles, and improved market access for EU wine and cheese‚Äù. ‚Ç¨4.5 billion worth of duties will be saved, according to the European Commission. The deal includes a standstill clause whereby remaining tariffs will not be raised above an agreed rate. The scope of the agreement is very broad.https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/june/tradoc_157964.pdf Besides tariffs, it covers Rules of Origin, Trade Remedies, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS), Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), Services and Investment liberalization, Competition Policy, Subsidies, State Owned Enterprises (SOE), Trade and Sustainable Development.. It also includes increased access to public procurement contracts and Intellectual Property Rights including \\"Geographical Indications\\" or protection for regional food specialities. Legal guarantees will be put in place protecting 357 European food and drink products from imitation including Prosciutto di Parma and Fromage de Herve. Customs procedures will also be simplified under the deal. If ratified, it will be phased in over 15 years. Opposition The deal has been denounced by European beef farmers, environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners. Protests against the deal have taken place. After Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro received much criticism concerning the protection of the Amazon rain forest, both Ireland and France voiced concern, and threatened a veto on the agreement unless action is taken by the Brazilian government.https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/ireland-block-eu- mercosur-trade-deal-amazon-fires-190823095908509.html =European farmers= The deal is expected to trigger a huge surge of Brazilian beef exports to all EU countries. Under the agreement, the EU will open its markets to a quota of up to 99,000 tonnes of beef per year at a preferential rate of 7.5% tariffs. Farmers throughout the EU oppose this, particularly smaller farmers who fear being undercut on price. The COPA-COGECA union, which represents 23 million farmers across the EU, warned the deal ‚Äúwill go down in history as a very dark moment‚Äù. The Irish Farmers' Association denounced the deal as a ‚Äúdisgraceful and feeble sell-out‚Äù. =Environmentalists= NASA satellite observation of deforestation in the Mato Grosso state of Brazil. The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development. Of concern also is the potential environmental impact of the agreement, in particular that it could represent a setback in the fight against climate change. The Amazon rainforest is one of the world's largest carbon sinks. But the amount of carbon that the Amazon is absorbing from the atmosphere and storing each year has fallen by around a third in the last decade. This decline in the Amazon carbon sink amounts to one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide ‚Äì equivalent to over twice the UK‚Äôs annual emissions. Since the election of Jair Bolsonaro as President of Brazil deforestation of the Amazon has intensified. The deforestation of the Amazon is now at its highest rate in a decade, with 2018 seeing a 13% increase in deforestation. Cattle farming is the single largest driver of Amazon deforestation, and has been responsible for as much as 80% of the deforestation. The current increased rate of rainforest destruction comes at a time of record beef exports from Brazil. The fear is that the deal could lead to even more deforestation as it expands market access to Brazilian beef. EU leaders have responded to criticism by stating that the terms of the deal do not contravene the targets of the Paris climate agreement and that the trade deal highlights a commitment to ‚Äúrules- based trade‚Äù. Yet, as Jonathan Watts points out, ‚Äúthere are countless reports of rule-breaking by Brazilian meat companies‚Äù. Many experts consider the environmental provisions in the current text of the deal to be ‚Äútoothless‚Äù as they lack enforcement powers Brazil is a signatory to the Paris climate agreement but President Bolsonaro has criticised it and threatened to pull Brazil out. As mentioned above, deforestation of the Amazon has intensified under Bolsonaro. He has been accused of weakening Brazil's environmental ministry, encouraging farming and mining expansion in the area and turning a blind eye to illegal destruction. The current environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has imposed the lowest number of fines for illegal deforestation in a decade. According to Jonathan Watts ‚Äònegotiations took almost two decades, which may explain why the outcome signed last week reflects the pro-industry values of the past rather than the environmental concerns of the present‚Äô. An editorial in The Irish Times states ‚ÄúEU countries are committing to achieving net-zero carbon by 2050, but this will prove meaningless if the planet‚Äôs greatest carbon sink is destroyed.‚Äù Former French environment minister Nicolas Hulot denounced the agreement in an interview with Le Monde, claiming that is \\"completely contradictory\\" to the EU's climate goals and warning that it would enable further destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Fears have been expressed in the Financial Times that the ‚ÄúEU-Mercosur deal will cancel out climate efforts‚Äù. =Indigenous rights activists= A burning forest in Brazil Aside from the threat to the climate, deforestation would directly impact Brazil's indigenous communities, who are already facing a worsening situation. Since becoming President, Bolsonaro has attempted to strip the indigenous agency FUNAI of its responsibility to identify and demarcate indigenous land and hand that power to the Agriculture ministry. Such a move would \\"put the fox in charge of the chicken coop\\", according to opposition Senator Randolfe Rodrigues. He has also defunded agencies responsible for law enforcement in the Amazon. Indigenous communities are facing direct threats. In 2019 an estimated 20,000 goldminers illegally invaded Yanomami Indigenous Territory, one of Brazil's largest indigenous territories. Yanomami campaigners have accused the president of encouraging the invasion by stating that indigenous people had too much land and that large-scale mining and extensive monoculture should be allowed on indigenous territory. Dinaman Tux√°, an indigenous leader, has said that \\"Accords like this only raise the level of violence against indigenous people. We need to tell the EU that signing this free-trade agreement could lead to genocide in Brazil. If they sign this agreement, blood will be spilled.‚Äù On June 18, 2019 over 340 civil society organizations wrote to call on the EU to halt the trade negotiations immediately and use their leverage as Brazil's second largest trading partner to improve the human rights situation in Brazil under Bolsonaro. The letter noted the decision to put indigenous land demarcation under the remit of the Agriculture ministry where the agribusiness lobby has powerful sway and repeated attacks and invasions of indigenous land by profit seekers. It also noted previous suspension of trade preferences with countries involved in human rights violations such as Myanmar and the Philippines in addition to restricting import of products related to human rights abuses such as conflict minerals. This letter echoed a similar plea made in May by 600 European scientists and 300 indigenous groups, which called on the EU to demand that Brazil respect environmental and human rights standards as a precondition for concluding the Mercosur trade negotiations. Finalization, signature and ratification In June 2019, representatives of EU and Mercosur announced they had reached an \\"historic\\" agreement After the adoption and publication of the 17-page \\"agreement in principle\\" on 1 July 2019, 29 unfinished texts of chapters and annexes of the trade agreement were published in July and September with a disclaimer that they were published \\"for information purposes only and may undergo further modifications including as a result of the process of legal revision\\". The essential liberalization schedules for goods, services and investment have not yet been released.https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=2048 Once the texts are final and legally revised they will need to be translated in all EU and Mercosur official languages. It may be up to two years before final text is available. In the meantime negotiations for the two other pillars of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement, namely \\"political dialogue\\" and \\"economic cooperation\\" continue. After finalization the draft association agreement must be signed and ratified by the European Council, the European Parliament, Mercosur and national parliaments, a process that may take many years in itself. An EU association agreement must also be approved by the national parliaments of EU member states. However, the European Commission may decide to present the trade pillar as a separate trade agreement. In that case, only the European Parliament will need to vote on the deal. The national parliaments of the Mercosur countries need to ratify the agreement in any case. There are a number of potential barriers that could stop the deal from being ratified. For example, the election of a more left-wing candidate in the 2019 Argentine general election. The increased presence of environmentalists in the European Parliament following the 2019 election has also been noted. The Economist speculates that distance and other priorities may cause of a loss of interest similar to that which delayed the talks for so long. In July 2019 a symbolic motion rejecting the trade deal was passed in D√°il √âireann, the lower house of the Irish legislature, by 84 votes to 46. The current government supports the deal however. In September 2019, lawmakers on the Austrian parliament's EU subcommittee almost unanimously voted to reject the draft free trade agreement citing concerns over their national farming sector and the Amazon forest fires. As such the government is obliged to veto the pact at EU level, where all 28 member states and their parliaments must agree to trade deals. Lawmakers from the centre-right √ñVP and the far-right Freedom Party also voted to reject the deal.

Within a few years, however, young \\"Lula\\" found work in Hollywood's rapidly growing film industry, initially performing in serials and in stand-alone shorts as an extra and in other small uncredited parts. Film career By the latter half of 1913 Maxam was cast as a supporting character in The Adventures of Kathlyn, Hollywood's \\"first cliffhanger serial\\". The absence of any 1914 releases in Maxam's known filmography suggests that more substantial roles continued to elude her until the following year, when she began to find steady, credited work in Westerns.

The movement is a member of the Cipayung Group and the Pancasila Front and is internationally affiliated with the World Student Christian Federation.  History  = Predecessors (1920-1950) = The need to establish a movement for Christian students in Indonesia began in the 1920s. The Christelijke Studenten Vereeniging op Java, as the predecessor of GMKI, was inspired by the (NCSV). One of the leaders of NCSV, C. L. van Doorn, arrived in Indonesia with his wife in 1921 to visit several Javanese cities in hope of establishing a similar organization in Indonesia. This bore fruit when he met with Johannes Leimena who, at that time, was still studying in STOVIA (medical school). Together, they established missionary activities, Bible discussions, and prayer groups. They formed the Christelijke Studenten Vereeniging Batavia in 1924 with its headquarters in Kebon Sirih. CSV conducted missionary activities in other cities and formed separate branches in Bandung and Bogor. Both branches were united with the formation of Christelijke Studenten Vereeniging op Java (CSV) on 28 December 1932. The formation of CSV was prompted by the decision of J. R. Mott, the general secretary of the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF), to hold the WSCF congress in Bogor in 1933. Due to the appointment of the organization as the host of the congress, CSV became more popular worldwide. CSV was invited to various meetings, such as the conference of Christian Youth in Oakland, California, and the international youth meeting in Amsterdam. With the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, which began on 8 March, 1942, CSV was dissolved by its leadership. After the proclamation of Indonesian independence, a new organization for Christian students in Indonesia, the Indonesian Christian Students Association (PMKI), was formed. The organization was formed at a meeting at the Jakarta Theological Seminary in 1945 led by Johannes Leimena and O.E. Engelen. PMKI's activities, such as Bible discussion, were largely the same as CSV's except that the organization was highly nationalistic, as it was filled by pro-independence students. PMKI later formed branches in Bandung, Bogor, Surabaya, and Jogjakarta. At the same time, due to the return of the Dutch Army to Indonesia, CSV was re-activated by the Dutch officials in several cities, which were largely the same cities as PMKI. PMKI supported Indonesia's independence, while CSV supported the Dutch. This dualism caused both organizations to be rejected in WSCF, and both organizations conflicted frequently. = Formation (1950) = Johannes Leimena was a national hero of Indonesia, and the founder of GMKI. After the recognition of Indonesia's independence by the Dutch, both student organizations continued to exist. To end further conflicts, both organizations decided to hold a meeting at founder Leimena's house at Teuku Umar Street No.36 on 9 February 1950. At the meeting, delegations from PMKI and CSV agreed to merge themselves into the Indonesian Christian Student Movement. = Development (1950-1960) = The Movement held its first congress on 23‚Äì29 December 1950. The congress discussed the general programs of GMKI and officially adopted Pancasila as the main theme of every congress. This political philosophy was in a speech by Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno given on 1 June, 1945, arguing that the Indonesian state should be based on Five Principles: Indonesian nationalism; internationalism, or humanism; consent, or democracy; social prosperity; and belief in one God. The congress recorded a total number of 481 members in five cities: Jakarta (181 members), Bandung (187 members), Yogyakarta (40 members), Surabaya (64 members), and Makassar (9 members). The branches of the Movement held another congress in Sukabumi in October 1952. The second congress adopted a new constitution for GMKI and began to set a theme for the future. The second congress of GMKI also established the Bible as the official book of GMKI and set 9 February 1950 as the official formation date of GMKI. The third congress of GMKI was held in Jogjakarta in 1952. During the congress, GMKI officially recognized two branches of GMKI in different cities, Medan and Bogor, bringing the number of members to 1099 in seven different branches. In the same year, GMKI was recognized as a full member of the World Student Christian Federation in its General Assembly in Nasrapur, India. The next important step in GMKI's development was its sixth congress at Sukabumi in 1956. The congress created and approved a new constitution, by which the leadership is elected for a two- year term. The congress reconfirmed its stance as an independent organization not affiliated with any political party. However, many people misinterpreted and saw GMKI as a wing of the Indonesian Christian Party. = Consolidation (1960-1970)=  \\"Old Order\\" Consolidation (1960-1965)  The first era of consolidation in GMKI included efforts to stabilize its internal structure and reconcile Christian groups outside GMKI. This era began with a national study and leadership conference in 1960 held in Lawang, East Java, and the eighth congress of GMKI in 1961 in Surabaya. The congress restructured the leadership of GMKI by centralizing it. Before the congress, GMKI was led through a decentralized system that included a general board formed from a federation of GMKI branches. After the centralization, GMKI was led by the central board. The congress also began to organize its branches to ease the expansion of the movement. During this era, there were two conflicting Christian youth organizations: the Union of Indonesian Christian Youth (PPKI) and the Ecumenical Christian Youth Council (MPKO). Through the initiative of GMKI, both parties held regular meetings, hosted by GMKI. The meetings ended on 23 April 1962 when both organizations agreed to fuse into the existent Indonesian Christian Youth Forces' Movement. Beginning in 1963, GMKI became more socialistic and supported Sukarno's policy of continuous revolution. Socialism became the main theme for the ninth congress: \\"By Faith We Build Socialist Indonesia,\\" and the sub-theme of the tenth congress: \\"With Independency We Built A Socialist Indonesia And A New World.\\" The tenth congress proclaimed GMKI as the \\"child\\" of the \\"church\\" in the Indonesian National Revolution. The congress also proclaimed that GMKI was no longer a mass organization, but a cadre organization. The proclamation was reinforced by the government's recognition of the nine Christian organizations in Indonesia in the National Front, within which the Indonesian Christian Party officially cooperated with GMKI. The statement, which was declared in 1956, revoked the independence of GMKI. The GMKI March. The tenth congress of GMKI in 1965 at Manado officially adopted a new march for the organization. The competition for the march began before the congress. During the congress, three different branches of GMKI proposed their version of the march. The march proposed by the Jogjakarta branch, which was composed by , won the competition after being approved by the congress forum.  \\"New Order\\" Consolidation (1965-1970)  GMKI demonstrating against the Indonesian Communist Party, the perpetrator of the 30 September Movement. After the 30 September Movement, GMKI dropped its socialistic stance and staunchly supported Pancasila as its official ideology. Together with other Christian organizations, GMKI joined the Pancasila Front as a way to show its support for the swelling anti-communist movement in Indonesia. The 30 September Movement was the main topic of discussion during the eleventh congress of GMKI in 1967 in Makale. The congress recorded the existence of 72 urban branches of GMKI, which was divided into 12 service areas. The rise of Suharto into the presidential seat brought the depreciation of GMKI in different regions. In the twelfth congress of GMKI in Kupang in 1970, the congress recorded the shrinkage of GMKI's branches from the peak of 90 branches after its 1967 congress to only 32 branches in 1970. The decrease in the number of branches was due, in part, to the revamping of the university system by the government, which caused the closing of several universities that had no clear license or status. The decrease was also caused by the student's disinterest in joining extra-curricular organizations. = New Order (1970-1998) =  Improvements  To adapt to the new situations in the New Order, the twelfth congress of GMKI agreed to become a functioning church in the universities. This action led to GMKI having a bigger influence, and by the beginning of the 1970s, GMKI became one of the two major Christian student's movements in the country, along with the Indonesian Christian Youth Forces' Movement, with GMKI being significantly bigger. GMKI became one of the five youth movements that initiated the informal \\"Cipayung Group\\" on 22 February 1972. The group officially formed the Indonesian National Youth Committee (KNPI) on 23 July 1973. After the formation of KNPI, GMKI became a major movement in universities. To cope with that, GMKI continued to make improvements to its organization. For example, currently, inactive and/or malfunctioning branches are evaluated, and some of those branches may be dissolved if their existence is not deemed necessary. The other improvements made during this era are in the caderization system. During its fifteenth congress in Palembang in 1976, GMKI formed a new institution for the caderization and filtering of its future members: the Institution for Development and Research of Cadre (). Five years later, GMKI produced the Basic Education System for Cadres (). PDSPK was continually used for ten years until it was reevaluated in 1992.  Adoption of Pancasila  During the 1980s, Suharto prompted political parties to accept Pancasila as their only ideology, thereby creating the unity of a single principle. This concept was first delivered during Suharto's speech in the Armed Forces meeting on 27 March 1980 and again on the Kopassus anniversary on 16 April 1980. The concept was formally delivered in 1983 and was approved as a law in 1985. All political parties and mass organizations, including GMKI, should hold Pancasila as their only ideology and principle, ruling out any other ideology previously held. The law was discussed in the twentieth congress of GMKI on Palangkaraya in 1986. Pancasila as a single ideology was adopted with the amendment of article 2 of the constitution. Previously, article 2 of the constitution stipulated that \\"In the life of the people and of the nation, the organization is based on the Bible.\\" After the amendment, the word \\"Bible\\" was replaced with \\"Pancasila\\", and the sentence is added with \\"as its only ideology\\". Even though this move was considered by some to remove its identity as a Christian organization, GMKI responded to this by moving the Bible reference to its preamble. = Reformation (1998-) = After the reformation era, the government revoked the obligation for all student organizations to adopt Pancasila as its single ideology. Although the obligation was revoked, GMKI still puts Pancasila as its only ideology. The organization was officially registered as an organization with an establishment act on 23 February 2011.  Organization  = Congress = The congress is the highest communal ruling body of GMKI. It has met biannually since 1956. Congressional decisions are legally binding if the congress is attended by at least half plus one branch of GMKI, and at least half plus one from the determined number of delegates. The number of delegates is based on the number of members in its corresponding branch. Branches that have 25-100 members may send one delegate, while branches that have more than 1750 members may send a maximum of 10 delegates. The congress is led by the Assembly of Heads, which consists of delegates and members of the Central Board appointed by the Congress. The congress is empowered to set the constitution of the movement, assess the general report by the Central Board, establish the outline of the program and GMKI, and elect the Central Board. The most recent congress held by GMKI was the 36th Congress of GMKI, which was held from 12‚Äì19 September 2018 in the Green Forest Hotel, Batu Tulis, Bogor, West Java. The congress was opened by President Joko Widodo. = Central Board = Sitting on the central board is the highest leadership position in GMKI. The board is filled by five persons: the Chairman, General Secretary, General Treasurer, and two other members, with the chairman and general secretary representing the organization in internal and external affairs. The central board is appointed by and responsible to the congress. The central board is also responsible for the preparation of the congress. The central board may establish and dissolve an auxiliary body in the form of a commission or committee. The central board may also appoint and depose members of the auxiliary body. The central board must also convene at least twice in a year. = Regional Conference = The regional conference is the highest body of GMKI at the regional level. The regional conference is tasked to assess the report by the Regional Board in the execution of the Congress, Central Board, and Regional Conference decisions, arrange the program for the branch, and establish the structure, policy, and budget. The conference is responsible to the Central Board via the Regional Board, and must convene at least biannually. The conference is also eligible to elect a new Regional Board. = Regional Board = The regional board is the board of GMKI on the regional level. The board is filled by a minimum of three persons, the regional chairman, secretary, and treasurer. The formation of the regional board must be communicated to the members of the branch at a maximum of two months after the appointment. The regional board is responsible for the regional conference and the preparation for the conference. The board must convene at least once every two months.  Membership  Even though there is no explicit obligation for a member to be Christian, GMKI states that the members should accept the vision and mission of the movement, which contains statements of \\"the recognition of Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour\\". However, the official explanation of the constitution states that membership is open to other students with other faiths. The constitution also explicitly states that members of the central and regional board must be Christian. The membership of GMKI is divided into four groups: ordinary, extraordinary, honorary and supportive members. Ordinary members are students who are currently active in a university and accepted by the Regional Board after fulfilling the prerequisites for membership. Extraordinary members are alumni who were ordinary members accepted by the Regional Board after fulfilling the prerequisites for membership. Honorary members are those who were considered meritorious by GMKI and were appointed by the Central Board with the recommendation of the Regional Board. Supportive members are those who help the movement periodically, and are appointed by the Regional Board.
