It looked like a small temple in antis with two columns on the fa√ßade; it was constructed of Paros marble and among its remarkable features were its \\"Aeolian\\" capitals. Description Within the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaea, to the west of the Athena temples and side to side with the Doric Treasury, was erected a treasury with a vestibule and cella. It had two columns on the facade, decorated with Aeolian capitals, which are generally considered as the precursors to the Corinthian capitals. The building measures 6.14 x 8.63 meters, it dates to ca 510 B.C. Its elevation was built of Paros marble. Its height was about 7.8 meters. One at least of its pediments bore sculpted decoration consisting of a chariot dragged by four horses. The sima was decorated with lion heads, whereas it was flanked by Nike-form acroteria. The Ionian frieze spread along its three sides, at least, and comprised more than 140 figures in battle scenes. An Amazonomachy and a Centauromachy have been securely identified.Bommelaer, P., Laroche, D., 1991, Guide de Delphes: Le site, Paris The Treasury was built by the Massaliots in order to enhance their increasing commercial power. Marseille was, after all, a colony of Phocaea in Asia Minor which was reported to have been founded by Phocaeans. However, it is possible that it constituted also an ex voto for the victory of the Massaliots against the native tribe of the Ligurians. Its identification is verified also by a fragmentary inscription on a marble architectural member, found in the region. In 2013 the sculpted decoration of the treasury was reconstructed in 3D form, for the celebrations of the anniversary of 2500 years since the foundation of Marseille.http://restauration- peinture.eu/archeologie/le-tresor-des-marseillais-experience/ References Sources Category:Ancient Greek buildings and structures in Delphi Category:Ancient Massalia ","title":"Treasury of the Massaliots (Delphi)"},{"id":"49393763","text":"Awateria echinata is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Borsoniidae.Marshall, B.

Chip shots usually have backspin, and if a chip doesn't, then it is usually considered a lob. In general, the lob requires that the player strike the ball with the front of their foot, using the toe to lift the ball up in the air. Mostly used to score, it focuses on getting the ball to a certain amount of vertical height, where the goalkeeper can't reach it and then have it come back down again into the goal. It takes a certain amount of technique and precision to do and players such as Carlos Vela, Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Radamel Falcao, Ronaldinho, Roberto Baggio, Rom√°rio, Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero and Lionel Messi have made it trademark moves. When a chip is used in a penalty kick, it is called a panenka. The rabona can also be considered a chip if it has the same arc and backspin that the chip does.

Early life Gibson was born in Lyttelton, near Christchurch, in 1868. She was one of ten children of Frederick Gibson and his second wife, Mary. All eight daughters in the family became teachers or school principals - Mary Gibson became the principal of Christchurch Girls' High School, Beatrice became the principal of Nelson College for Girls, and Ethel, Alice, Ruth and Winifred taught at Rangi Ruru School. There were also two brothers, Frederick and Thomas. Education Gibson attended Mrs Crosby's private school in Christchurch, followed by Christchurch Girls' High School. She attended lectures at Canterbury College, and painting classes at the Canterbury College School of Art, but did not graduate with a degree. Career Gibson's father bought a school run by friends of his, the Greshams, in 1889. Gibson visited the families of the pupils and persuaded almost all of them to remain at the school under the new management of Gibson, her mother and her sister Alice. They renamed the school Miss Gibson's Private School for Girls, and began with 18 pupils. The school was developed as a place for teaching strong Christian values. Cooking and hand sewing were compulsory subjects, and the girls were expected to adhere to high standards of personal grooming and conduct. The school prospered under Gibson's leadership, growing to around 100 pupils by 1917, and to over 200 by the time of her death in 1938. Gibson continued to paint throughout her life, and frequently gave gifts of paintings to family and friends. She also taught drawing and painting at the school, and was involved with the Canterbury Society of Arts; she exhibited her art there, and in 1900, she was on the society's council. She also had paintings exhibited at the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, the Auckland Society of Arts and the Otago Society of Arts. Apart from a one-year visit to England in 1906, Gibson ran Rangi Ruru School until her death in 1938. She never officially retired, remaining actively involved in the school.  Legacy  A stained glass window in St. Mary's Church, Christchurch, commemorates Gibson's life and work. Rangi Ruru School holds 15 paintings by Gibson in its art collection: landscapes in oils and watercolours.

Its former building on Gammel M√∏nt (No. 1) is designed by Ulrik Plesner. It now houses the newspaper Weekendavisen. History The Women Readers' Association's premises on Amagertorv photographed by royal photographer Mary Steen Kvindelig L√¶serforening was founded at the initiative of Sophie Petersen (n√©e Alberti) on 1 October 1872 and was inspired by L√§sesalong f√∂r Damer in Sweden. The library initially comprised 1,007 volumes. The number of members quickly grew and it outgrew its premises several times. The Women Readers' Association's n new building on Gammel M√∏nt Plandrawing In 1910, the Women Readers' Association purchased a lot at the corner of Gammel M√∏nt and Antonigade. A four-storey building designed by Ulrik Plesner and Aage Langeland-Mathiesen was completed at the site in 1910. It contained reading rooms, a lending department, restaurant as well as hotel rooms reserved for women on the top floor. The latter was inspired by the Martha Washington Hotel in Nyew York City. The association gained increased momentum and became a power factor in the 1900s. With 100,000 volumes, its library developed into the largest private collection of fiction in the Nordic countries in the 1930s. In the late 1940s, the number of members began to decline and the association experienced economic difficulties. In 1941, it sold its building to Berlingske Tidende. The Women Readers' Association closed in 1945. The building has later housed Weekendavisen.

Alfred & John Bool took the photographs, and when the project was announced in a letter to The Times, the news received such a positive response that the society's work was continued, with a total of twelve issues being produced over twelve years, containing a total of 120 photographs. The photographs were commissioned to preserve an architectural record of buildings, some of which were built before the Great Fire of London in 1666, and which were scheduled for demolition as part of the city's urban redevelopment measures at the end of the 19th century. It was important to choose a photographic technique that would last for generations. In 1870, the pigment printing process was invented. Society member Henry Dixon mastered the process, and the photographic images are still of excellent technical quality today.

The fuselage lies upside down and both wings were severed. Baron 52 was the call sign of a United States Air Force EC-47 carrying eight crew members that was shot down over Laos during the predawn hours of 5 February 1973, a week after the Paris Peace Accords officially ended the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The remains of four crewmen were recovered from the crash site, but those of the remaining four have never been found. Although the U.S. government considers them to have been killed in action and as late as 1996 listed them as \\"accounted for\\", family members and POW/MIA advocates believe the four survived the crash and were taken captive and possibly sent to the USSR. The intelligence gatherers and their equipment would have been highly valued by the Soviets who maintained a presence both in Laos and North Vietnam. The incident has been featured on several nationwide news programs and a 1991 episode of the U.S. television series Unsolved Mysteries. More recent research by the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Servicemen presented to Congress has prompted a status review of the incident scheduled to take place in 2016. The mission Although the Paris Peace Accords had officially ended the United States' direct role in the Vietnam War, only a week after its signing the U.S. Air Force sent an EC-47Q electronic warfare collection aircraft on a night-time radio-direction-finding mission to monitor the Ho Chi Minh trail and locate North Vietnamese tanks moving south. The plane, tail number 43-48636, belonged to the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron and began its mission from Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. The flight crew also were part of the 361st while the collection crew manning the rear of the plane were from Det 3, 6994th Security Squadron. Over Laos, the plane began taking anti-aircraft fire and went down in Salavan Province, Laos about east of the city of Salavan and from the border with South Vietnam at a site in the jungle within of three major roads leading into North Vietnamese-held territory. Crew 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: *Capt. George R. Spitz ‚Äì Pilot *2nd Lt. Severo J. Primm III ‚Äì Co-Pilot *Capt. Arthur R. Bollinger ‚Äì Navigator *1st Lt. Robert E.

Dale Brandenburg ‚Äì Systems Repair Technician Recovery efforts The location of the wreckage was first discovered by U.S. Air Force search and rescue on 7 February 1973. The plane was determined to have crashed inverted, coming to rest upside down in the jungle; both wings had been sheared off. A team consisting of three pararescuemen and an intelligence expert were on the ground for approximately an hour and found three bodies in the charred wreckage, those of Spitz, Prim and Bollinger in the cockpit, still strapped in their seats. Outside of the wreckage, they found Lt. Bernhardt's body. In the rear of the plane they observed that the jump door had been removed (it was never located), the crew's safety belts were unbuckled, and all of the top secret sensitive equipment was missing as were the rear crew's parachutes. On 9 February 1973, Bernhardt's remains were recovered and positively identified four days later. On 22 February, the other seven men were declared killed in action despite no confirmation of the fates of the four members of the collection crew. Controversy The families of the missing crew members believe there is evidence they bailed out and were taken captive by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). They point to information in official reports, such as the fact that their safety belts were unbuckled and their remains were not at the crash site, to support their beliefs that the rear crew had time to bail out. In addition, at approximately 8:00 AM on 5 February, U.S. Intelligence listening post at Phu Bai Combat Base in South Vietnam intercepted NVA communications from the area indicating they were transporting four captured Airmen. Such communications continued to be intercepted for the next three months. Also on record is a Pathet Lao radio intercept regarding four \\"air pirates\\" captured the day Baron 52 was shot down; no other U.S. aircraft was downed that day. A Laotian operative secretly working for the U.S. reported observing the transport of four prisoners along the road near the crash site. All of these records remained classified by the U.S. government. This evidence was first presented to the American public by columnist Jack Anderson on the U.S. news program Good Morning America in 1978. During Anderson's report, he stated a \\"Pentagon spokesman now agrees there's a good chance these four men were survivors of the crash. Yet, the Pentagon deliberately gave the families misinformation\\".Subcommittee, United States. Congress. House. Committee On National Security. Military Personnel. Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review of Indochina Pow . Reprint. London: Forgotten Books, 2013. 38-9. Print. Retrieved 10 February 2016. In 1992, in front of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified that it was the government's position that these reports were unrelated to Baron 52; this testimony was repeated in 1994 before the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In November 1992, the Lao government allowed a team to survey the crash site where a dogtag with Sgt. Matejov's name on it was found, after nearly 20 years, lying in plain sight. Also recovered were 23 bone fragments and half of a tooth which were taken to the Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, where Ellis R. Kerley publicly stated that the bone fragments \\"can not be proven conclusively to be human.\\" According to further testimony given before the House Subcommittee by Albert Santoli, Kerley was replaced by \\"a U.S. Army Lt. Colonel, professionally a dentist, who has limited forensic experience\\", and the bone fragments were declared to be the remains of all seven of the remaining crew members. The families requested DNA analysis be done on the bone fragments and tooth, but their requests were denied by the government. On 27 March 1996, the bone fragments were interred at Arlington National Cemetery in a group burial. The families of all seven men attended although the families of the four rear crew members were there to \\"honor the sacrifice\\" of the flight crew and did not believe the bone fragments were those of Melton, Matejov, Cressman or Brandenburg. Matejov's younger brother, John Matejov, has sought help from both Wyoming Senators and Congressmen in petitioning the Pentagon for further information as well as appealing directly to President Obama. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Roger Shields said the government \\"acted 'precipitously' to declare Matejov and the other three missing crew members to be dead\\". In their book, The Men We Left Behind, Mark Sauter and Jim Sanders wrote that \\"The names were scratched from the list (of MIAs) because they were an inconvenience that would have complicated Henry Kissinger's life\\". Kissinger negotiated the Paris Peace Accords and was responsible for carrying out President Nixon's promise to bring all POWs home. They further alleged that \\"the men weren't dead, and the Pentagon knew it\\" and that it was covered up because the flight was illegal under the Paris agreement. Congress is set to review the status of the four crewmen in 2016. The status of one of the four crewman was not changed to MIA 2016.US Stars and Stripes 2016 As of September 2020 the entire crew is listed by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency as accounted for.

She was the first native-born Indiana woman to acquire a PhD degree in mathematics, and most likely the first woman born in Indiana to receive a doctoral degree in any scientific discipline. Early years and education Ruth Ellen Gentry was the youngest of three children born to Jeremiah Gentry (1827‚Äì1906) and Lucretia (Wilcox) Gentry (1830‚Äì1909). Jeremiah was a farmer and stock trader who moved to Hendricks County, Indiana from Bullitt County, Kentucky, when he was five years old, and remained there the rest of his life. Ruth and her siblings, Oliver (1853‚Äì1878) and Mary Frances (1860‚Äì1929), were born and grew up on the family farm near Stilesville, Indiana. Ruth's early education took place there as well. Gentry attended Indiana State Normal School, a teachers' college that had opened in 1870 but did not yet award bachelor's degrees. After graduating in 1880, she taught at preparatory schools for ten years. In 1885, she decided to get her bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan‚Äîat that time one the few American colleges to admit women as undergraduates. She studied mathematics for a year and then went back to teaching school, moving to Florida for the years 1886‚Äì88 to teach at DeLand Academy and College (which changed its name while she was there to DeLand University). Biography on p.202-204 of the Supplementary Material at AMS Gentry did her graduate work starting in 1890 at Bryn Mawr College, which at that time was one of the only institutions of higher education in the country to admit women for graduate studies. In 1891 she was a Fellow in Mathematics at Bryn Mawr. Following her first year, she was awarded the Association of College Alumnae European Fellowship, becoming the first mathematician and second recipient of the honor. She used the fellowship to study in Europe in 1891‚Äì92. Gentry went first to Germany in the hope of being allowed to sit in on lectures by German mathematicians at one of the country's universities (which at the time did not admit women). After she had been turned down by numerous professors, Lazarus Fuchs of the University of Berlin secured permission for her to attend lectures by himself and Ludwig Schlesinger. This arrangement lasted only one semester before being revoked by university administrators. She remained in Europe for an additional semester, attending lectures in mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris. Upon her return to Bryn Mawr, Gentry was appointed a fellow in mathematics for 1892‚Äì93, after which she stayed on another year as a fellow by courtesy of the school. She became Charlotte Scott's first graduate student, and in 1894 she finished her doctoral work at Bryn Mawr. Her thesis, On the Forms of Plane Quartic Curves, was not published until 1896, which is why she is sometimes described as one of Scott's first two students, along with Isabel Maddison. Career After earning her PhD, Gentry taught at Vassar College, becoming the first person on the mathematics faculty at Vassar to hold a doctoral degree. In 1900 she was made associate professor. Two years later, suffering from health issues, Gentry left Vassar to become the associate principal and head of the mathematics department at Miss Gleim's, a private school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1905 she left this position and became a volunteer nurse. She traveled in the United States and Europe for a time, but suffered from further health problems. Her illness progressed until she died of breast cancer in Indianapolis, Indiana at the age of 55 on October 18, 1917. She is buried in Stilesville Cemetery in Stilesville, Indiana. Mathematical interests Gentry's main interest was in geometry, especially the study of quartic curves, which was the content of her thesis. Honors In 1894, while still at Bryn Mawr, Gentry became a member of the New York Mathematical Society, which later became the American Mathematical Society.

In Hilbert space, Delta-convergence and weak convergence coincide. For a general class of spaces, similarly to weak convergence, every bounded sequence has a Delta- convergent subsequence. Delta convergence was first introduced by Teck-Cheong Lim,T.C. Lim, Remarks on some fixed point theorems, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 60 (1976), 179‚Äì182. and, soon after, under the name of almost convergence, by Tadeusz Kuczumow.T. Kuczumow, An almost convergence and its applications, Ann. Univ. Mariae Curie-Sklodowska Sect. A 32 (1978), 79‚Äì88.  Definition  A sequence (x_k) in a metric space (X,d) is said to be Œî-convergent to x\\\\in X if for every y\\\\in X, \\\\limsup(d(x_k,x)-d(x_k,y))\\\\le 0.  Characterization in Banach spaces  If X is a uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach space, with the duality mapping x\\\\mapsto x^* given by \\\\x\\\\=\\\\x^*\\\\, \\\\langle x^*,x\\\\rangle=\\\\x\\\\^2, then a sequence (x_k)\\\\subset X is Delta-convergent to x if and only if (x_k-x)^* converges to zero weakly in the dual space X^* (see S. Solimini, C. Tintarev, Concentration analysis in Banach spaces, Comm. Contemp. Math. 2015, DOI 10.1142/S0219199715500388). In particular, Delta- convergence and weak convergence coincide if X is a Hilbert space. = Opial property = Coincidence of weak convergence and Delta-convergence is equivalent, for uniformly convex Banach spaces, to the well-known Opial property  Delta-compactness theorem  The Delta-compactness theorem of T. C. Lim states that if (X,d) is an asymptotically complete metric space, then every bounded sequence in X has a Delta-convergent subsequence. The Delta- compactness theorem is similar to the Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem for weak convergence but, unlike the Banach-Alaoglu theorem (in the non-separable case) its proof does not depend on the Axiom of Choice. = Asymptotic center and asymptotic completeness = An asymptotic center of a sequence (x_k)_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb N}, if it exists, is a limit of the Chebyshev centers c_n for truncated sequences (x_k)_{k\\\\ge n}. A metric space is called asymptotically complete, if any bounded sequence in it has an asymptotic center. = Uniform convexity as sufficient condition of asymptotic completeness = Condition of asymptotic completeness in the Delta-compactness theorem is satisfied by uniformly convex Banach spaces, and more generally, by uniformly rotund metric spaces as defined by J.

Pierre Terblanche led the design team during Himalayan's development.  Model History  The Royal Enfield Himalayan was conceived by CEO Siddhartha Lal, as an adventure touring, or dual sport motorcycle. The Himalayan differs considerably from the other motorcycles offered by Royal Enfield - most of which are various incarnations of the Bullet utilising the same frame and engine - in terms of its chassis and powertrain. Pierre Terblanche, formerly of Ducati and Moto Guzzi among other companies, headed Royal Enfield's design team during development of the Himalayan. An early prototype was made in mid-2014, followed by a more complete version in 2015. The vehicle was released in India in early 2016, followed by a release in international markets such as Philippines, Australia and the United Kingdom later that year. The export model differed from the domestic in that it included Electronic Fuel Injection as well as ABS. Upon its introduction, the Himalayan was praised for its good suspension and off-road ability, while some criticism was directed to the relatively low power output of the engine. The motorcycle also has longer intervals between servicing and oil changes. The early Himalayan suffered some production issues. It was noted that the quality of parts was not up to the mark and in 2017 some users filed lawsuits to either demand compensation or return the bike for refund. The company responded and in 2018 it was reported that \\"Royal Enfield is taking proactive steps to ensure the quality of its adventure motorcycle, the Royal Enfield Himalayan, both in the domestic and in the international markets.\\"  Design  = Engine = The Himalayan's engine was designed and produced by Royal Enfield from the ground- up and shares little to no parts with other contemporaries in the company's line-up. The engine, named the LS410 indicating its long-stroke stroke ratio, is a unit-construction 411 cc single-cylinder, oil-cooled 4-stroke SOHC engine. The motor generates a power output of 24.5 bhp at 6,500 rpm (18.02 KW) and a maximum torque of 32 Nm at 4,000-4,500 rpm. The engine also includes an oil cooler, a first among motorcycles manufactured by Royal Enfield India. Fuel is supplied to the engine via carburettor in the Indian market, and via electronic fuel injection for other world markets, likely due to emissions regulations. Due to the emission norms in India BS-IV regulation has been applied, Now the New Royal Enfield Himalayan comes with Electronic Fuel Injection Technology in India. The engine is mated to a 5-speed constant mesh transmission. This engine has a single overhead camshaft, thereby moving away from the traditional push-rod design that had been used by the company from 1955, starting with the original Bullet up to the contemporary Classic series. = Frame and Chassis = The Himalayan has a half-duplex split cradle frame. Suspension is telescopic in the front while the rear is provided with monoshock suspension. Front forks are 41 mm with 200 mm of travel and the rear suspension offers 180 mm of travel. The motorcycle has a ground clearance of 220 mm. Stock tires measure 90/90 21-inch at the front and 120/90 17-inch at the rear. These are manufactured by CEAT. For units sold in North America, the tires are manufactured by Pirelli (MT-60). The motorcycle has a 300 mm disc with a dual piston floating caliper at the front and a 240 mm single piston caliper disc at rear. The instrumentation console for this motorcycle is also modeled anew. It includes an analog speedometer and tachometer, with a digital display for the odometer, gear position indicator, trip-meter and Ambient temperature gauge. Also included is an analog fuel gauge and a digital compass. Also included is a windscreen, which can be manually adjusted for height via screws to two positions. The motorcycle was designed specifically with touring in mind and features an up-right seating position, with a seat height of 800 mm, allowing the rider to be seated relatively low compared to the overall height of the motorcycle. The motorcycle also features mounts on either sides of the tank, which can serve as holders for jerrycans, as well as tank guards. The rear includes a luggage carrier, and mounts are also provided as well to install aluminium panniers, both provided by Royal Enfield as accessories.

The initial workforce consisted of only 350 people but throughout the years, the growth of the company saw this figure rise to 5,000 in the 1960s and 70s. At its peak, the Hoover Factory was the largest employer in the borough.  History  Originally, the land that the Hoover factory stands on was a part of the Plymouth Ironworks, an industry which epitomised the area during much of the 18th and 19th centuries. After the decline of this industry and after the closure of the ironworks in 1882, the area was need of and had the space available for new industries to overtake. Building of the Hoover Factory began in June 1946, with the first turf being cut by the Chairman and Managing Director of Hoover Ltd., C.B. Colston. Construction was completed and the factory opened in October 1948 with VIP visitors from London present.  Production  When the factory first opened in 1948, it provided much needed employment for a relatively small number of people but after the growth of the white goods industry and the decline of coal mining in the area, the employment rates increased significantly. The factory was treated with a royal visit from Princess Margaret in 1950. Due to the growing demand of Hoover products, the factory underwent an extension during the late 60s/70s. This extension was officially opened with a visit from the Queen on the factory‚Äôs diamond jubilee in 1973. The atmosphere workers experienced whilst working at the factory can be considered pleasant. The workers of the factory were like a family and the days were filled with laughter and singing. The factory itself was more than a place to work. It had a number of sports teams and events and the Christmas parties held, not only for staff but for local children, gave the factory a real sense of community. In 1985, Sir Clive Sinclair‚Äôs, Sinclair C5 motor car, was launched and later produced at the Hoover Factory. After a few short months, the Sinclair C5 was deemed a failure and production stopped after Hoover took out a writ against Sinclair for ¬£1.5 million of unpaid debt.  Decline  = Flights Scandal = During 1992, with a backlog of products, Michael Gilbey and Brian Webb, marketing executives at the Merthyr factory, thought they had the perfect solution to this particular problem. Their idea was to give two free flights to either Europe or America to each customer that purchased ¬£100 worth of electrical goods. More than 200,000 people qualified for the flights during this promotion and unable to meet demand, Hoover lost a total of ¬£20 million. = Further Troubles and Closure = After continuous financial problems, Hoover UK/Europe was sold to the Italian-based company, Candy, in 1995. Following the takeover, production continued but staff numbers fell. Further talk of job cuts continued throughout the 1990s and workers grew more concerned as the years went by. In 2002, a fire tore through the factory which caused disruption to production and by 2004, amid talks of 130 job losses, the workers went on strike. Work continued in the Hoover factory until Candy announced that it would be moving production abroad to countries such as the Czech Republic and the Far East. Final production in the Hoover factory, Pentrebach, ceased on 13 May 2009, 61 years after it first opened, with the remaining 337 members of staff being left unemployed. It is now used as a warehouse and distribution centre for domestic goods for Hoover Candy  References  Category:Buildings and structures in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough ","title":"The Hoover Factory, Pentrebach"},{"id":"49394262","text":"Caleana major, commonly known as the large duck orchid, is a small orchid found in eastern and southern Australia.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 241 This terrestrial plant features a remarkable flower, resembling a duck in flight. The flower is an attractant to insects, such as male sawflies which pollinate the flower in a process known as pseudocopulation. In 1986 this orchid was featured on an Australian postage stamp.  Description  Caleana major is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of with a single reddish, narrow lance-shaped leaf, long, wide and often spotted, emerging at its base. Up to five shiny reddish brown flowers, long and wide are borne on a thin, wiry flowering stem. (In rare cases, the flower can be greenish with dark spots.) The sepals and petals are long and have pointed tips. The column has broad wings which the dorsal sepal and petals almost touch and the lateral sepals turn back wing-like behind the flower. The labellum is long and wide and resembles the head of a duck on a strap-like \\"neck\\". Flowering occurs from September to January. Taxonomy and naming Caleana major was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen he collected at Port Jackson, Bennelong Point in September 1803. The description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The genus name (Caleana) honours George Caley, an early botanical collector and the specific epithet (major) is a Latin word meaning \\"large\\" or \\"great\\".  Distribution and habitat  The flying duck orchid occurs in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, growing in eucalyptus woodland, coastal or swampy shrubland and heathland. Mostly near the coast, but occasionally at higher altitudes. Ecology The plant is pollinated by insects. The labellum is held above the flower by a sensitive strap-like stalk. When touched, the labellum turns rapidly downward, trapping a visiting insect between the labellum and column wings.  Cultivation  Caleana major has been difficult to maintain in cultivation. Plants flower for one or sometimes two years but progressively weaken until they die.

The canvas painting of the Holy Family (kept in the sacristy). Sacra Famiglia (\\"Holy Family\\", called also chiesa di San Giuseppe or Mezzana or Culliggeddu because of its small dimensions) is a religious building in Alcamo, Sicily, southern Italy; it is located on the ground floor of the Ex Jesuits' College.Alqamah - \\"Festa della sacra famiglia \\"U Patriciniu\\"  History  The church was built thanks to Father Vincenzo Abbati, who died in 1654. After his death, his body was first buried in the church of Stellario and later was moved inside the church of Jesus, after its completion. In this church, on 25 April 1745, the male Congregation of Madonna del Lume (named after middle-class people, that is \\"little land owners\\"), was formed. According to the chronicles of the time, the members met every Sunday evening, and the congregation was abolished on 28 July 1770 by a royal decree. The church was run by the Society of Jesus until their expulsion in 1860. Later (more precisely since 1866) the administration of the church passed to the Congregation of the Holy Family, which had been founded inside the Ex Jesuits' College on 15 November 1824 by Father Domenico Maria Lo Jacono, who was its director and catechist. Probably, after the Jesuits' expulsion, the congregation of Madonna del Lume moved into the church of Santa Maria del Soccorso. In 1901 they founded the female congregation of Madonna del Lume (Madonna of Light), that moved into a chapel inside the chiesa madre in 1942. On the altar there is a painting dedicated to Madonna del Lume painted by Giuseppe Renda. In Alcamo the feast of Madonna del Lume was celebrated on the fifth Sunday after each Easter; two weeks after the festivity of Patrocinio. In 1947 monsignor Giuseppe Barone was appointed as its Rector and under his leadership the church was modernized. The Church was closed in 1968, owing to the damages suffered during 1968 Belice earthquake; it was later restored and cleaned, thanks to the financing by Nicol√≤ Cassar√†, before being fully reopened.  Description and works  The church has a single navy with three altars: the high altar (in white marble and adorned by red stucco columns) and two side altars, in polychromatic marble, realized and inaugurated in 1937. *Until 1952 on the high altar there was a painting made by Giuseppe Renda (1772-1805) from Alcamo, now kept in the sacristy and in the same year substituted by a wooden statue of the Holy Family, realized by the firm Luigi Santifaller from Ortisei (Bolzano) and donated by Nicol√≤ Cassar√† from Alcamo. For this reason they transformed the wall, by building an oval niche, where they placed it, embellishing it with two small columns in red stucco, similar to the existing ones. Under the high altar, inside a marble urn there are the relics of Saint Benedict the Moor, Saint Paulinus of Nola, and Saint Casimir. *On the left altar there is a Holy Crucifix (which was kept in the attic of the Ex Jesuits' College according to tradition), made by an unknown author and restored in 1901. *On the right altar you can see the painting of Madonna del Lume, by an unknown author and placed on the altar in 1740, that they restored in 1901 too. In a picture dated 1969 we can notice Our Lady and her Infant Child's silver crowns attached to the painting and other silver ornaments: two ear-rings, a small necklace and a pin. On the right side of the high altar there is the \\"Passion's chapel\\" (built with the will of the congregation of the Holy Crucifix), where there are the statues of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, Our Lady of Sorrows, Jesus scourged and tied to a column and Jesus dead in the inferior level. These statues come from a group which were kept in the Ex Chiesa di Santa Maria dello Stellario. Next to them you can see a painting of Saint Michael (archangel), who Father Pugliese lighted candles to, in order to keep the rain away during the feast of Patrocinio, taking place on the third Sunday after Easter, when they offered lunch to poor families in piazza Ciullo. On the side walls there are four oval paintings made by Gioacchino Speciale (1923-2004), from Partinico, realized in 1955 in substitution of the others which were in a bad state: *The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple *The Annunciation *The Virgin's wedding *The escape to Egypt. On the ceiling there is the Ascension of Mary and of his son Jesus (by an unknown author). In 1926 they made the wooden pulpit decorated with carvings representing the joiner's tools (tongs, a hammer and a saw) on both sides and Saint Joseph's emblem (that is the sun, stars and ears of wheat seen by Joseph the Just) on the fronton: everything is surmounted by a wooden canopy which matches the style. In the same year this pulpit won a prize in an exhibition at Montecatini Terme. You could enter it through an external wooden small staircase, that was substituted with a more comfortable one, made in masonry, set into the wall and hidden by a small door. At the corners of the pulpit there are two little columns adorned with Corinthian capitals which surmount two angels‚Äô heads; behind them, on the wall, there is, as a decorative motif, a great stucco in the shape of a snail. The choir, which you can reach through a small staircase set into the wall, has got a harmonium and is embellished by a wooden parapet. In 1954 under the choir, in order to increase the Church's luminosity, they placed a new wooden inner door with large glasses in four parts, that is formed by two sides small doors and two central ones, with the sign of a cross in the middle (inscribed in the middle of a circle) and made by Vito Fulco. On this occasion they also restored the choir, letting it lean on cement columns with a marble base. During these works they have also changed the first electric installation (dating back to 1912) and placed two small holy water stoups, made in red marble. Outside one of the two windows of the choir there are two bells. The choir and the inner door. The church Confessional has got two kneeling-stools and is placed in a niche set into a side wall of the Church.

He was a professor at the University of M√ºnster where he is the director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology. Some of his scientific contributions involve the first genetic sequencing of a ribosomal RNA operon, the design of plasmids for studying gene expression, expression vectors for high-level production of recombinant proteins and RNA, RNA biology, RNomics as well as the significance of retroposition for plasticity and evolution of genomes, genes and gene modules including regulatory sequences or elements. Biography =Early life and education= Brosius studied chemistry and pharmacy at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and in 1974 graduated and completed the Staatsexamen (state examination) in Pharmacy. Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. work in biochemistry and molecular biology at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin Dahlem in which Heinz-G√ºnter Wittmann was department head. While determining the primary structures of several E. coli ribosomal proteins, he developed manual micro-methods for isolating peptides using two-dimensional separation on cellulose thin layer plates (instead of using a series of chromatography columns) followed by dansyl-Edman degradation. This reduced the required protein material by one to two orders of magnitude towards the 100 nanomol range.Brosius J. Primary structure of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L31 Biochemistry. 1978 Feb 7;17(3):501-8 This method was shortly thereafter superseded by automated protein sequencing operating in the low picomol range.Hunkapiller MW, Hood LE. Protein sequence analysis: automated microsequencing. Science. 1983 Feb 11;219(4585):650-9. =Postdoctoral fellowships= From 1977‚Äì1980, Brosius spent a postdoctoral fellowship supported by the Fogarty International Center in Harry F. Noller‚Äôs lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There, he sequenced the first large ribosomal RNAs via their genes utilizing the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing method. It took ~2.5 years to sequence the 7.5 kilobases encompassing the entire rrnB rRNA operon in addition to some flanking regions.Brosius J, Dull TJ, Sleeter DD, Noller HF. Gene organization and primary structure of a ribosomal RNA operon from Escherichia coli. J Mol Biol. 1981 May 15;148(2):107-27.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Nov 25;21(23):5408-17.y During his stay at UCSC Brosius met visiting professor Carl Woese, who incited his interest in evolutionary thought and the power of molecular phylogenetic analysis. His second postdoctoral fellowship (1980‚Äì1982), supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft, took him to the laboratory of Walter Gilbert, Nobel prize laureate in Chemistry (1980), at Harvard University. Here, Brosius began to develop plasmid vectors for the selection of promoters and terminators,Brosius J. Plasmid vectors for the selection of promoters. Gene. 1984 Feb;27(2):151-60.Brosius J. Toxicity of an overproduced foreign gene product in Escherichia coli and its use in plasmid vectors for the selection of transcription terminators.

Sloan Foundation and the Irma T. Hirschl Trust.Irma T. Hirschl Trust In 1988, he moved with his research group to Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Associate Professor and in 1994 as full Professor and Director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology to the University of M√ºnster, Germany. In the mid-nineties, he established a transgenic and gene targeting facility serving the entire campus and beyond by generating, for example, mouse models designed for the study of human genetic disorders.Core Facility TRAnsgenic animal and genetic engineering Models (TRAM) of the Medical Faculty M√ºnster As of beginning 2015, he is also Visiting Professor at the newly founded private Medical School, Medizinische Hochschule Brandenburg Theodor Fontane. Scientific contributions In the early 1980s, Brosius became interested in a small brain-specific RNA that was thought to be a waste product of a mechanism orchestrating the expression of genes by RNA polymerase III transcription of identifier sequence (ID) repetitive elements, classified as SINEs, short interspersed repeats, located in the introns of brain-specific genes by making chromatin accessible to RNA polymerase II.Sutcliffe JG, Milner RJ, Gottesfeld JM, Reynolds W. Control of neuronal gene expression. Science. 1984 Sep 21;225(4668):1308-15 This attractive hypothesis was not tenable. Instead, the Brosius laboratory focused on this brain cytoplasmic BC1 RNA, cloned it as cDNA by developing a method for generating cDNA libraries based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, and isolated its single gene, which evolved from a retroposed copy of a transfer RNA (tRNAAla). It was shown that BC1 RNA is the source gene for ID repetitive elements in rodents, and his laboratory established that the dendritic localization of BC1 RNA in neuronsDeChiara TM, Brosius J.

Translational machinery in dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture. J Neurosci. 1996 Nov 15;16(22):7171-81. Based on these findings, Brosius concluded as early as the eighties that: 1\\\\. Functional RNAs are not only fossils from a by-gone RNA worldBrosius J. Echoes from the pastare we still in an RNP world? Cytogenet Genome Res. 2005;110(1-4):8-24. but can arise de novo in modern cells and contribute to the functionality of a cell or organism; many more RNAs are yet to be discovered. 2\\\\. Retroposition (conversion of RNA to DNA) is an ancient process, but has persisted throughout the evolution of most eukaryotes. This process has contributed to the mass of genomes of modern multicellular organisms,Brosius J. RNAs from all categories generate retrosequences that may be exapted as novel genes or regulatory elements.

(2012) Application of information technologies in precision apiculture. In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA 2012), Indianapolis, USA. It can be considered a branch of precision agriculture (PA). Similar to PA, implementation of PB also can be split into three phases: data collection, data analysis and application. During the data collection phase, measurements from bee colonies and the environment are collected. The data analysis phase draws conclusions regarding bee colony behaviour and activity trends based on measurement data, predefined models and expert knowledge. In the application phase, decisions are made and actions undertaken based on data analysis for improving apiary performance. One of the main objectives of PB is to implement real time and on-line tools for continuous monitoring of bee colonies during their life and production stage using the automatic, automated and information technology based solutions, without exposing the bees to avoidable stress and waste of resources. Bee colony monitoring Various technologies can be applied for monitoring the bee colony and implementation of data collection phase. The data collection process in PB can be classified into three groups 1) apiary-level parameters (meteorological parameters and video observation); 2) colony-level parameters (temperature, humidity, gas content, sound, video, vibration of hive and weight); 3) individual bee-related parameters (the number of incoming/outgoing bees, the number of bees in the hive entrance area). Temperature measurements of bee colonies have the longest history. Nowadays, bee colony temperature measurements seem to be the simplest and cheapest way to monitor bee colonies. The low costs of data collection, processing and data transfer of temperature measurement systems facilitate application of temperature measurements in beekeeping. Monitoring of the bee colony temperature can be performed using various methods and technologies: 1) Manual temperature measurements, measurements by different loggers and iButtons; 2) Wired sensor networks; 3) Wireless sensor networks; 4) Infrared imaging. Temperature data can help to identify such colony states as: 1) death; 2) swarming; 3) brood rearing; 4) broodless state. Weight monitoring of the colony can be used to identify: 1) occurrence of nectar flow during the foraging season; 2) consumption of food during non-foraging periods; 3) the occurrence of swarming events through a decrease in the hive weight; 4) estimation of the number of foragers. There are two ways of measuring the weight of the colony: 1) automatic measurements, which can be made using industrial scales; 2) manual weight measurements. Audio signals and audio processing techniques can be applied to estimate bee behaviour. Many devices and methods have been developed for sound analysis but they are not widely applied in industrial beekeeping. So far, the solutions seem to work only in the hands of researchers. The reason for this may be the large stochastic component in the buzz of a colony and the complexity of sound interpretation. As well means of a simple transducer secured to the outside wall of a hive, a set of statistically independent instantaneous vibration signals of honey bees can be identified and monitored in time using a fully automated and non- invasive method.

Petrie, his wife and his daughter Mary Petrie were involved in the foundation of Westfield College. His other daughter Irene Petrie died as a missionary in Kashmir. Life He was born on 1 June 1823, at the Manor House, King's Langley, Hertfordshire, the second son of Commissary-General William Petrie (died 1842); his mother Margaret was daughter and coheiress of Henry Mitton of the Chase, Enfield. He was brought up in Portugal and the Cape of Good Hope, where his father's career took him. As a young man he was mainly in France, Italy, and Germany. On 14 April 1846 Petrie entered the army as an ensign in the Royal Newfoundland Corps, and served for 11 years in North America, becoming a lieutenant on 7 January 1848 and captain on 5 May 1854. On 26 January 1855 he was transferred to the 14th Foot regiment, and left Newfoundland on 20 March in the SS Vesta, which carried 24 passengers, seven of them, including Petrie, being officers on their way to join regiments in the Crimean War. When 300 miles off St. John's the vessel, already damaged by ice-floes, was caught in a storm, and the engine-room was flooded. Petrie managed to save the ship. His hands, however, were lacerated and frostbitten: he was invalided for some time, and could not proceed to the Crimea. In May 1856 Petrie joined the Royal Staff College, and in December 1858 he passed the final examination, coming out first on the list. He was attached to the topographical department of the War Office from 10 March 1859 to 30 June 1864; then for 18 years (1864‚Äì1882) he was examiner in military administration at the Staff College, and latterly at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst also. He became major on 13 July 1867, and exchanged to the 97th Foot later that year; in July 1872 he retired on half-pay, in 1876 became colonel, and in 1882 withdrew from the service. Petrie read papers on military matters at the Royal United Service Institution, of which he was a member; and as a freemason he was master of the St. John's, Newfoundland, lodge, and a member of the Quatuor Coronati lodge in London. He was active in philanthropic and religious work, and was a trustee of the Princess Mary Village Homes. Petrie and his family were involved in the foundation of Westfield College. The Petrie family introduced Ann Dudin Brown to the steering group and she funded the colleges creation. His daughter Irene Petrie decided she wanted to be a missionary. Her father forbade it. Petrie died on 19 November 1892, at his house Hanover Lodge, Kensington Park, London, and was buried at Kensal Green. Irene set out the following year for Kashmir. Irene Petrie died as a missionary in 1897.Jeffrey Cox, ‚ÄòPetrie, Irene Eleanora Verita (1864‚Äì1897)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 June 2017 Works In 1860, during his first year at the War Office, Petrie brought out a standard work in three volumes, The Strength, Composition, and Organisation of the Armies of Europe, giving the annual revenue and military expenditure of each country, with its total forces in peace and war. In 1863 he published a volume giving more detailed information on the British army, The Organisation, Composition, and Strength of the Army of Great Britain, which reached a fifth edition in 1867. Petrie also compiled two technical volumes, Equipment of Infantry and Hospital Equipment (1865‚Äì6), forming part of a series on army equipment. Family Petrie married Eleanora Grant, youngest daughter of William Macdowall of Woolmet House, Midlothian, and granddaughter of Sir William Dunbar, 3rd Baronet of Durn; she died on 31 January 1886. They had two daughters: Mary Louisa Georgina Petrie, the elder, wrote Clews to Holy Writ (1892) and other books, and married Professor Charles Ashley Carus-Wilson of McGill University; and Irene Eleonora Verita Petrie was a missionary for the Church Missionary Society in Kashmir.

His style influenced Robert Greene, and paved the way to euphuism. Life He was younger son of John Le Petite or Pettie of Tetsworth and Stoke Talmage, Oxfordshire, by his wife Mary, daughter of William Charnell of Snareston, Leicestershire. He became a scholar of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1564, and graduated B.A. on 29 March 1569. According to Anthony Wood, William Gager of Christ Church was a close friend. At Christ Church, Pettie was servitor to Thomas Bernard, with Richard Verstegan. Pettie travelled abroad, and apparently had some military experience. On returning home he concentrated on writing. Guazzo's Civile Conversation. He died, according to Wood, during July 1589, in his prime, at Plymouth. He was buried in \\"the great Church\\" at Plymouth. Works The success of The Palace of Pleasure (1566‚Äì7) of William Painter prompted Pettie to write a similar book: A Petite Pallace of Pettie his Pleasure, contayning many pretie Hystories by him, set foorth in comely Colours, and most delightfully discoursed.‚Äô It was licensed for the press to Richard Watkins on 6 August 1576, and was published soon afterwards, without date. Pettie, in his preface, says he mainly wrote for gentlewomen, and deprecated all comparison with the Palace of Pleasure. The author apologised for modernising classical tales. The stories are twelve in number.‚ÄòSinorix and Camma,‚Äô ‚ÄòTereus and Progne,‚Äô ‚ÄòGermanicus and Agrippina,‚Äô ‚ÄòAmphiaraus and Eriphile,‚Äô ‚ÄòIcilius and Virginia,‚Äô ‚ÄòAdmetus and Alcest,‚Äô ‚ÄòScilla and Minos,‚Äô ‚ÄòCuriatius and Horatia,‚Äô ‚ÄòCephalus and Procris,‚Äô ‚ÄòMinos and Pasiph√¶,‚Äô ‚ÄòPigmalions freinde and his Image,‚Äô and ‚ÄòAlexius.‚Äô The book was popular, and two other editions, set up from new type, appeared in the same year. Other editions appeared in 1580 and 1598 by James Roberts, and in 1608 and 1613 by George Eld. Pettie also translated the first three books of Stefano Guazzo's Civile Conversation, via French. Richard Watkins obtained a licence for the publication on 27 February 1581. The first edition appeared in that year with a dedication addressed from Pettie's lodging near St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 6 February 1581, to Marjorie, wife of Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys. The work is in prose, with a few verses interspersed. A second issue by Thomas East was dated 1586, and included a fourth book of Guazzo, begun by Pettie, but completed from the Italian by Bartholomew Young. Family Pettie left lands at Aston Rowant, Kingston Blount, and Tetsworth, handed down from his father, to his brother Christopher.

It has smooth greyish bark, sometimes with rough flaky bark near the base, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, whitish flowers and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit.budsfruit Description Eucalyptus gittinsii is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth brownish to white bark, sometimes with rough, flaky bark that peels off near the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, broadly lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club- shaped, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering occurs between December and February and the flowers are white or whitish. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule that is more or less square in cross-section, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gittinsii was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen that Blaxell collected \\"67 km south of 'Billabong Roadhouse'\\" in 1975. The specific epithet honours Clifford Halliday Gittins (1904 - 1995) for his assistance to the National Herbarium of New South Wales. In 2000, Dean Nicolle described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus gittinsii Brooker & Blaxell gittinsii has glossy green adult leaves; * Eucalyptus gittinsii subsp. illucida D.Nicolle has dull, light green to bluish-green adult leaves. Distribution and habitat The northern sandplain mallee is found along the west coast of Western Australia on sand plains, sand dune and ridges in the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy soils often with lateritic gravel. Subspecies gittinsii grows in and near the Kalbarri National Park and subspecies illucida between Three Springs and the Moore River. Conservation status Both subspecies of E. gittinsii are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Costeff was born in Sep. 14, 1926 to Dr. Harry and Stella Costeff in Peoria, Illinois. His father, Harry Gedalya came to the USA from a Jewish village named Kabaschei in the Ukraine, served in the first World War and later studied to be a pharmacist, and then a medical doctor. He pioneered the use of insulin shock therapy for Schizophrenia, and founded a private hospital in Peoria. Hanan grew up in Peoria, served in the navy during the latter part of WW2, and trained as a radio technician. Upon being released, he used the GI bill to study medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, graduating in 1951. He met and married Ramona Doctor in Chicago in 1951. In 1950, while still a student he visited the newly founded State of Israel, traveled, met some family and managed a children's ward at the then new immigrant camp of Rosh Ha'Ayin. Upon completion of his residency, and the birth of his first son, Philip Avner, the young family immigrated to Israel and joined his parents who had preceded them and were living in Haifa. Costeff acted as a pediatrician in clinics in Kiryat Shmona, and then Beer Sheva, where he traveled to Kibbutzim and Moshavim treating children in the Tipat Chalav (well baby clinics) outreach program. In one instance he was able to diagnose the earliest case till then of Phenylketonuria, and was noticed by the head of the clinic. In 1963 the family, that now included Judy and Gady who were born in 1958 and 1961 respectively, traveled for a two-year post- doctorate at the Child Study Center at Yale University, where Hanan trained as a pediatric neurologist. The family returned to Israel, with Hanan chosen to head up the Child Development Unit at the Tel Hashomer hospital, where he worked until 1973. He was then asked to set up the Child Development Center at the Leowienstein Rehabilitation Medical center, where he worked till his retirement in 1998. Following his retirement he re-invented himself and became an recognized medical expert for the courts, as well as working in the Macabbi HMO in his specialty. Research Costeff published approximately 40 original research papers over his career. He was as much a researcher as a medical practitioner. His interest ranged over a wide scope, and he was self trained in a variety of disciplines and techniques making him somewhat of a renaissance figure. These included a working knowledge of statistics, genetics, neurology to name a few. His first paper was authored during his post-doctorate, and was a algebraic formulas to find a practical method of calculating the surface area of a body, useful for calculating some dosages. He taught at the Tel Aviv University School of Medicine, as well as throughout his career, and he established a generation of pediatric neurologists in Israel who looked up to him as their mentor. A syndrome first described by him carries his name: the Costeff Syndrome. His papers pioneered new ways of looking at diagnosis and treatment of mental retardation, with an emphasis on challenging entrenched theories. He was essentially a man of truth and he often found himself in the minority. He gave testimony about medical neglect in the Beit Tina trial, leading to a judgement against a decorated Army doctor, something that at the time was unheard of. He worked with the Knesset committee to enact a law in Israel that would ensure hospitals that lost medical files would become liable for the damages. He developed tests to verify the need and efficacy of the widespread use of Ritalin, and was concerned about the misuse of the drug in schools and by teachers. Private life When his daughter, Judith became a religious orthodox Jew, he joined the Reform Jewish Movement, and with his wife, Ramona, became one of the pillars of the Ramat HaSharon congregation, eventually being chosen as a member of the national board. He died in 2005, in his Ramat HaSharon home, after a 15 year long fight with several forms of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Throughout this period there was no abatement of his intellect or memory.

It includes the northern four blocks of Maine Street, the town's principal commercial thoroughfare, which was laid out in the late 17th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The town of Brunswick's early colonial history begins with the establishment of Fort Andross, on the south bank of the Androscoggin River near the former Cabot Mill site, in about 1688. From this fortification a wide road was made to the shores of Maquoit Bay to the south, which became what is now called Maine street. The town of Brunswick was chartered in 1737, and was initially powered economically by mills along the river, and by maritime trade. Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794, with its campus south of the commercial district, and the mills were expanded in the 19th century, especially after the railroad arrived in 1849. In the 20th century, Brunswick Naval Air Station, southeast of the downtown, also provided an economic benefit to the region.Roberts, Janet; Robinson, Annie (2015). NRHP nomination for Brunswick Commercial Historic District; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The historic consists of the northern four blocks of Maine Street, including most of the buildings between Mill and Pleasant Streets. These buildings are typically one or two stories in height, either of brick or frame construction. Most of them are Colonial Revival in style, although a number of earlier 19th century revival styles are also represented.

Richard Lusimbo (born 1987) is a Ugandan LGBT activist, documentary filmmaker, and public speaker who gained international attention when he was outed in a Ugandan tabloid newspaper for being gay. He has since gone on to gain recognition as the Research and Documentation Officer at Sexual Minorities Uganda, and has appeared in New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, The Advocate, The Guardian, among others.  Activism  In August 2011, Lusimbo began volunteering at Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), Uganda's umbrella LGBTI organisation. There he was called upon to convince an LGBTI health conference, supported by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance Uganda. For the first time, Lusimbo was actively involved in the Ugandan LGBTI community, working as the Executive Assistant to Frank Mugisha, the Executive Director of SMUG. In 2012 Lusimbo was hired as the Research and Documentation Officer at SMUG. There he began documentation of human rights abuses experienced by the LGBTI community in Uganda, production of policy reports to highlight cases and recommendations for action by civil society and the state to ensure the health and rights of LGBTI persons. In 2012 he also became the Chair of African Research Team for Envisioning Global LGBT Human Rights, and began production of a documentary on the anti-homosexuality movement in Uganda. This gave Lusimbo an opportunity to travel across the country to speak with LGBTI persons on a personal level. Not long after beginning work at SMUG, in 2013, Lusimbo was outed in a local tabloid, \\"Red Pepper,\\" along with other staff of SMUG. Later, his photo appeared along with his address on a Ugandan Facebook campaign to attack LGBTI Ugandans. Lusimbo had to leave his home and stay with a friend, and later leave the country for a month and stay in the United States. While in the U.S., Lusimbo used this as an opportunity to share his story and of other Ugandan LGBTI persons. He gave speeches at the University of Vermont, and University of Rochester, and State University of New York at Geneseo. In April 2013, Lusimbo returned to Uganda and continued work at SMUG, until the Anti-Homosexuality Bill passed through parliament in December 2013. Again in 2014, after the Anti-Homosexuality Act was signed into law by Ugandan President Museveni, Lusimbo was outed on the cover of the popular local tabloid, \\"Red Pepper,\\" with the headline \\"Top Gays Speak Out: How I Became Homosexual.\\" This brought a lot of fear. Lusimbo received many threats, hate mail on his phone and social media forcing him into hiding. In May 2014, Lusimbo became the Country Coordinator for REAct (Rights, Evidence, Action). He worked as a consultant to train on the human rights and monitoring system, including human rights theory, questionnaire adaptation, interviewing skills and the use of MARTUS to record cases. Part of team that developed and pilot-tested REAct. Consultancies successfully completed with the International HIV/AIDS Alliance and Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), AIDS Legal Network (ALN), Community Health Alliance Uganda (CHAU). In 2015, Lusimbo premiered his documentary Film, \\"And Still We Rise\\" in Kampala, Uganda. The film documents the resistance and resilience of Ugandan LGBTI persons throughout the Anti-homosexuality movement. The documentary is a form of participatory film-making and was created by people in the midst of the struggle against the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda. Lusimbo has continued to serve his community in different forms. This includes the, International Planning Board of the Planning Conference, Miami Out Games, Coordinator of Pride Uganda 2015, Co-Chair Alternate of the 2014‚Äì2016 Pan-African ILGA Board, Co-Secretary General Alternate of the ILGA World Board 2014‚Äì2016, Advisor to Benetech the designers of MARTUS software used for REAct, board member, Transgender Equality Uganda from 2012 until 2015, and Boardchair from 2015 until present. Further, Lusimbo lead the Ugandan delegation to the United States in the Sexual Minorities Uganda v. Scott Lively case in 2013. Lusimbo. Lively is perhaps the most infamous example of Christian leaders involved in the Anti-Homosexuality movement in Uganda, and is being sued by SMUG in a U.S. Federal Court for crimes against humanity after he came to Uganda and took part in the drafting of the Anti-Homosexuality Act. Lusimbo has served as a witness in the case, and gave a deposition in 2015.

Next to the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple stands the Ecology Education Center.  History  On the exact spot where one can today find the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple once stood the old Tiejiashu Temple, hidden amongst the foliage of age-old trees. The Tiejiashu Temple was built at the time of the Han Dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220) and remained there until the Cultural Revolution. It was one of the oldest temples dedicated to the gods of Mount Taibai and the first temple on the route taken by pilgrims along the south side of the mountain. In the Tiejiashu Temple, the pilgrims were given water and could rest in preparation for the climb to the summit. Every year, between 9 June and 9 July of the Chinese lunar calendar, all temples on Mount Taibai gathered for the big temple feast at the old Tiejiashu Temple. There was a lively market, rituals were performed and many pilgrims started the trail to Ba Xian Tai (Terrace of Immortalisation), the top of Mount Taibai. This summit was the place where Jiang Ziya, the wise minister of the Zhou Dynasty who had helped overthrow the corrupt Shang Dynasty (second millennium BC), had made immortal all those who had come to his aid. Like many temples in China, the Tiejiashu Temple was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. According to residents from the Mount Taibai area, there was a Taoist monk around the middle of the twentieth century whose name, ironically, was Mao. He was living in the old Tiejiashu Temple when the Cultural Revolution broke out. The residents tried to defend the temples and mountain from attacks by the Red Guard but the old temple was destroyed and the monk was forced to leave. After the Cultural Revolution, in the 1980s, opportunities to restore Taoist temples grew slowly but steadily. First, local residents built a few simple rooms where the three gods of Mount Taibai could reside. Then, in the 1990s, a request to reopen the temple was submitted to the local government body responsible for monitoring religious activity. Permission was granted and, under the leadership of the Louguan Tai Temple, where Lao Zi is said to have written the Tao Te Ching, the rooms regained their use as a place of quiet rest and contemplation. In the autumn of 2002, four extra rooms were built. Now the three gods of Mount Taibai each had their own room, with the remaining rooms available for the monk of the Louguan Tai Temple, who was going to live there, and his guests. Slowly but surely, the old Tiejiashu Temple came back to life, just like many other temples in China. Following many years of ravage and ruin, Taoism seemed just as robust and indomitable as the Sacred Mountains themselves.  The Iron Armour Tree  Tiejia means ‚ÄòIron Armour‚Äô and shu means ‚Äòtree‚Äô, referring to the three-thousand-year-old tree that had always stood by the entrance to the old temple and survived the Cultural Revolution. The edges of its leaves are often serrated, which is why people call it Iron Armour Tree. The tree is known for the curse that is cast on anyone who destroys it. This is why during the Cultural Revolution not even the Red Guard students dared to harm it. The tree is the protector of the Taibai gods and is still worshipped as much as the gods themselves.  Building the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple  It was this spot where the Alliance of Religions and Conservation, at the initiative of the local Taoist community and co-funded by the Ecological Management Foundation, built the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple for the worship of the three gods of Mount Taibai and an Ecology Education Center to help stimulating what had been such an important part of Taoism since ancient times, namely preserving the natural environment. In 2004, the World Wildlife Fund appealed to the Alliance of Religions and Conservation for help because they wanted to build an eco-resort on Mount Taibai and had discovered the seven rooms at the site of the old Tiejiashu Temple. Earlier, the World Wildlife Fund had already built a number of panda sanctuaries to protect the environment of the Qinling panda. The eco-resort was now supposed to start generating income as a means of financing those sanctuaries. The World Wildlife Fund asked the Alliance of Religions and Conservation to investigate. The Alliance of Religions and Conservation's secretary-general Martin Palmer met the vice-abbot of the Louguan Tai Temple, Master Ren Xingzhi. Both quickly saw the opportunities for a fruitful and sustainable partnership. These meetings gave rise to the plans for a Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple with an Ecology Education Center next to it. To help finance the execution of the plans, an appeal was made to Allerd Stikker, founder and chairman of Ecological Management Foundation. Since the inauguration in 2007, the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple with the Ecology Education Center have been the epicenter of an effort to make China's Taoist temples more sustainable and to create an awareness of sustainability issues.  The Ecology Education Center  Respect for nature has always been deeply rooted in Taoist thought and is crucial to China in the present era of ecological crisis. Through the Ecology Education Center, the Taoist monks of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple would be able to organize meetings and training programs designed to help people think in terms of sustainability, not only local visitors but also monks from other temples. The Alliance of Religions and Conservation's ambition was to inspire all temples and help them set up their own ecology education centers, thereby facilitating a network of such centers throughout the Sacred Mountains.  Design  The Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple is designed by Chinese architect He Xiaoxin. It is modest in size and constructed with sustainable, natural materials from the region. In the background you can hear the constant babble of the stream that flows along the front of the temple. This is because Taoist temples are generally modest and simple in size and structure and one with nature. It often seems as if they grew from the earth and stones that surround them. They are certainly not built for you to stand by the window and admire the view. Like other Chinese temples, the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple faces south, the direction of the divine, or heaven. The three gods of Mount Taibai also face south, making everyone else face north, towards the earth. To fully understand the construction of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple also the Chinese philosophy of feng shui should be borne in mind. It is mostly because of this feng shui philosophy that the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple is built as an integral element of its surroundings and the natural environment. Going by the rules of feng shui, the temple stands in an ideal spot: against the background of a Sacred Mountain with a stream flowing along the front and tall, old trees all around.  Nature and tradition  The design of the temple follows the traditional style of temples from the Qing Dynasty. This style requires the square surrounding the temple and the temple itself to be symmetric, with the temple standing at the center-back of the square, flanked by other religious buildings. In the case of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple, the Ecology Education Center is located west of the temple and one of the old temporary rooms east. During construction the Ecology Education Center was positioned a few yards too far to the east, making the design of the square no longer perfectly symmetric and the square a bit smaller than planned. But the walls of the temple site follow tradition to the letter, with a natural hedge of shrubs instead of a stone structure. The temple walls themselves are clad in tiles. The roof of the temple features all kinds of symbols of immortality and hope such as butterflies, fishes and bats, and a dog that barks when evil spirits come near. The ends of the stone pipes punctuating the roof consist of angry looking faces that keep away evil spirits. On the underside of the temple roof, the wood is red as is one of the outside walls of the education center. Red stands for good luck, the sun and energy, and Taoists consider this the most ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô colour of all. When you enter the temple, the three gods of Mount Taibai -now known as Da (Great) Taibai, Er (Second) Taibai and San (Third) Taibai - stand in the middle of a spartan space. On both sides of the gods, the walls are covered with murals. In its center, by the feet of the three gods of Mount Taibai, stands the temple's incense burner.  Incense Burner  In every Taoist temple stands an incense burner. The tradition of burning incense originated during the Zhou Dynasty (1000‚Äì256 BC) when king Zhou Men Wong used the rising smoke to send his prayers to heaven. The incense burner of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple was donated by Allerd Stikker, founder and chairman of the Ecological Management Foundation, in memory of his daughter Anneke Dorina Stikker (1955‚Äì2004). He Xiaoxin, the Chinese architect of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple and the Ecology Education Center, designed the incense burner together with Allerd Stikker and his family. The incense burner is plated in robust but refined red bronze with elegant horses galloping along the top edge that, in Taoist tradition, carry the soul of the departed to eternity.

The introduction of local government to the Mallee region in the 1870s had been the subject of significant local conflict among the residents of the Hundreds of Wirrega and Tatiara, which would be described in 1880 as \\"at present...the only agricultural settlements in the South Australian mallee country\\". Some residents of both the Hundred of Wirrega and the Hundred of Tatiara had petitioned for their own District Councils in 1875, while others had protested against the creation of a council at all, stating that the area was \\"too small and scattered\\". Another local group, among them local MP Friedrich Krichauff, argued that a united District Council should be created to cover both hundreds, as they were too small to sustain their own and a larger municipality would be cheaper. The advocates of the united council were successful, and the District Council of Tatiara was created in 1876. In 1884, there was a renewed push for a separate council at Wirrega, with residents citing the state of local roads and the administration of vermin destruction laws among their reasons for wishing to secede. Unlike in 1875, the renewed push met with success, and the District Council of Wirrega was proclaimed on 31 July 1884. The boundaries of the new municipality were stated to comprise \\"the whole of the Hundred of Wirrega, bounded as follows; commencing at the north-west corner of the Hundred of Tatiara; thence west by the production of the north boundary of said hundred for 16 miles 1,655 links; thence true south to the north boundary of County MacDonnell, thence east along said boundary to the south-west corner of the Hundred of Tatiara, and north along the west boundary of said hundred to the point of commencement.\\" A site for a council chamber in Mundulla was proclaimed in 1885, and the Wirrega Council Chambers opened on 1 June 1886. The separate Wirrega municipality was to be short-lived. In 1887, local government in South Australia underwent a major consolidation, which became the District Councils Act 1887. The District Council of Wirrega was merged back into the District Council of Tatiara, which also underwent a further expansion into surrounding lands. Two local state MPs, Andrew Dods Handyside and Beaumont Arnold Moulden, opposed the merger, suggesting instead that portions of surrounding townships be merged into Wirrega, and that recent improvements in the district would be lost if \\"the district were to lose its individuality\\". Moulden and Handyside were unsuccessful, and Wirrega was merged into the District Council of Tatiara when the Act was gazetted on 5 January 1888. The former municipality became the Mundulla and Buckingham wards of the Tatiara council. The former council chambers were used by the District Council of Tatiara from 1888 until 1904, when the municipality built new chambers at Bordertown. After the council moved to Bordertown, the building was used for many years by the Mundulla Tennis Club. It was restored in 1973, and now houses historic local photographs. A commemorative council meeting was held in the building in 1986, and it was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 21 October 1993. In 1916, a number of Tatiara councillors proposed the secession of Wirrega to form a new District Council of Wirrega, consisting of the Hundreds of Wirrega, Parsons and Pflaum. They claimed the larger council was unwieldy and that road grants were not properly proportioned among the wards, and presented a petition of ratepayers in support. While the Commissioner of Crown Lands at the time stated that he would give their request \\"favourable consideration\\", it was not recreated.

De la Rua with the presidential cane Election Fernando de la R√∫a was elected on October 24, 1999 and took office on December 10, 1999. De la R√∫a ran on the Alliance Party ticket as a Radical Civic Union member with running mate Carlos √Ålvarez. Along with the De la R√∫a‚ÄìAlvarez win, the Alliance Party gained a majority over the Justicialist Party in the Chamber of Deputies. The De la R√∫a‚Äì√Ålvarez ticket defeated the Peronist candidates Eduardo Duhalde and Ram√≥n Ortega with 48.5% of the vote against 38.09%. In third place, with 10.09% of the vote, was the former economy minister Domingo Cavallo. De la R√∫a ran a successful TV advertising campaign with the slogan \\"They say I'm boring.\\" The advertisement sought to contrast with a public perception of frivolity within the Carlos Menem administration. The campaign was led by Ramiro Agulla, David Ratto (the publicist for Raul Alfonsin in the 1983 elections), and Antonio de la R√∫a, son of Fernando de la R√∫a. During his father's presidency, Antonio de la R√∫a led the \\"Sushi Group\\" (El grupo sushi), which was often criticized for its political influence. 1999 and 2000 The public rejection of Carlos Menem along with the country's deteriorating economic situation strongly contributed to de la R√∫a's victory. At the end of 1999, Argentina's GDP dropped 3.4%. Unemployment approached 14%, after reaching a record high of 18.6% some years before. Although lower than previously, poverty was still at 30%. The country faced serious education and public health problems, and the political leadership had a poor public image. The Peronist government left a high fiscal deficit, with over a billion pesos deficit and an external annual debt of approximately 150 billion pesos, which would grow to nearly 25 billion pesos in the next year. De la R√∫a took harsh adjustment measures in the face of the country's financial situation. In January 2000, he raised taxes for the middle and upper classes. This policy was part of an overall package intended to improve the economy and attend to outstanding debts such as the Teacher Incentive Fund, but was nevertheless insufficient to solve the deterioration of the public finances. He also intervened in the Corrientes province. For months, there had been a serious political and financial conflict in the area, with consecutive strikes and the dismissal of the governor Hugo Rub√©n Perie. Ram√≥n Mestre was appointed to defuse the conflict. Throughout 2000, the government sought to control public spending, lower domestic interest rates and maintain monetary and financial stability. The year ended with a slight decline of 0.5% of GDP and an unemployment rate of 14.7% (INDEC October 2000). International reserves, in the order of 33 billion dollars, were also held while reducing the fiscal deficit by about 5 billion pesos. He launched initiatives such as the Infrastructure Plan through agreements with provincial governments, and private funding sought to perform road, water and housing improvements throughout the country for 20 billion dollars. The measure was taken by decree since, according to Interior Minister Federico Storani, there was no assurance that Congress would sanction the law as quickly as necessary. De la R√∫a's government asked for further assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private banks to reduce the pressure of foreign debt. In December 2000, Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea negotiated a bailout package of about 40,000 million dollars, known as a financial shield. The bailout was done with hopes of gaining trust and credibility abroad, so as to lower interest payments and more easily renew maturities. 2001 =Politics= In addition to the serious economic crisis, the political system as a whole appeared powerless from the resignation of Carlos Alvarez, vice president and leader of Frepaso in October 2000. Such resignation came amid a scandal, in which they denounced alleged bribes in the Senate to approve a controversial labor reform law. The objectives of the Education Reform Act were on one hand to weaken the power of large unions in favor of small ones, and on the other hand to lower labor costs. The Justicialists' strong resistance to votes on the draft amendments produced almost completely lessened its effect on the union structure. These negotiations involved the then Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique and union leader Hugo Moyano. Moyano was firmly opposed to the reform, arguing that it would result in lower wages and that it would be driven by the IMF. Flamarique tried to get the support of the unions by promising that national associations would still be the recipients of the union dues contributed by the members, but this was divided internally to the General Labor Confederation. The resignation of Carlos Alvarez was a break in the Alliance; but Frepaso officials remained in their positions, many of them until the end of the process. This break deepened in Parliament: there, the slim majority which had the ruling party in the House of Representatives would reduce every month, as lawmakers from the center-left parties were leaving the coalition for political differences with de la R√∫a's style of government. Former President Carlos Menem was arrested and placed under house arrest on June 8, as the alleged head of a conspiracy that would have made an illegal sale of 6,500 tons of weapons and ammunition to Ecuador and Croatia, and for falsifying the contents of three presidential decrees. This, rather than signifying a success for the government, was a major problem. Justicialism took up Congress to reject the ex-president's arrest, who then was released by the Supreme Court Decision, by six votes to two, on November 21 of the same year. The Court then ruled that there was no conspiracy and forgery decretos. En ideological in June 2013 the trial was reviewed and Menem sentenced to eight years in prison. The sentence is under appeal. The political situation was generally unfavorable. In the Senate most it was the Justicialista Party. In the Chamber of Deputies he had the majority but this was minimal. Unionism made seven general strikes during the delaruista government and most provinces had their own governors PJ. Also lacked a clear partisan support, and various sectors of radicalism and the Frepaso began to distance themselves from the resignation of Carlos Alvarez, the appointment of Domingo Cavallo and sustained economic policy.

Amid these problems, there were also positive aspects, as it was getting in the school year 2000 were met 180 school days, a record for more than a decade, thanks to the interest to be put on increasing weeks of the school year as teachers to avoid conflicts with the payment of educational incentive. In this context of broad political and economic problems, the legislative elections of 2001, where the Peronist won with 40 percent nationwide, with 24% of a decimated Alliance lost more than 4,500,000 votes over occurred what has been achieved just two years earlier. For the last two years of management, radical government would face a Congress fully oppositor.31 The blank or null vote reached record highs in the history of democracy in Argentina: the combination of blank ballots, invalid ballots and absenteeism rose to 41% equivalent to 10.2 million argentinos.32 The social situation led to the generalization of piqueteros groups throughout the country, a form of expression that uses the full or partial blockage of routes or streets in protest. While the Justicialist Party held the presidency of the Senate by Ramon Puerta, and appearing in the line of succession presidencial. =Economics= In January 2001 the Central Bank's international reserves had reached a record high of 37,380 million dollars, which would be passed in 2007 during the government of N√©stor Kirchner.34 File: Lopez.Murphy.ogv Economy Minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy announced the setting and widespread budget cuts. Following this announcement, thousands of Argentines, especially the student movement took to the streets to protest against the setting. March 2001 Source: Radio and Television Argentina. http://www.rta-se.com.ar In March 2001, and with diversions budget targets in the first quarter of the year saw the departure of Jos√© Luis Machinea of the Ministry of Economy and named for the same to until then Defense Minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy, a respected economist but the more liberal wing radicalism that took to the objectives of shrinking state spending and increase revenue fiscal.35 his plans for improving the economy making a tremendous cuts in public spending, withdrawing funds from areas such as health or education, collided with a strong popular opposition, particularly within the Radical Party and its youth and college arms. He also put in a position to break the ruling coalition because Frepaso members within the Cabinet announced his resignation after he was presented the economic program. Because of this, Lopez Murphy was forced to retire after just 16 days in the ministry economy.36 The Alliance government resorted to name as economy minister Domingo Cavallo, who had held the position for several years the government of Carlos Menem.

In July of that year, because of the tax burden and the inability to normalize the economy, Cavallo turned to a strong economic orthodoxy. To this end it presented a plan of \\"zero deficit\\", with a new board cut in public expenditure management to avoid spending more than it earned in the Estado.41 Resistance Congress for the law in question was very large, even within the radical sectors in acceding to Alfonsin, but De la R√∫a was obtained by asking an effort both opposition lawmakers as own and the population in general. It was argued that .42 This did not help \\"chaos if no deal comes\\", and continuously adjusting the economy contracted further in the framework of an international context of regional and global recession, which also helped the Argentina to grow. In November, the government of De la R√∫a began a restructuring of external debt commitments, so-called \\"mega-swap\\" 43 By the end of that month, the unprecedented worsening of the economic situation, investments away due to the complicated situation policy caused public distrust in the financial system, so strong withdrawals from bank deposits occurred. To stop them, the economy minister imposed restrictions involving the freezing of funds deposited in banks, measurement known as the \\"corralito\\" 44 The measure was enacted on December 1 and originally allowed only one withdrawal of 250 pesos weekly cash the ban on sending money out of the country and the obligation to perform most of the business operations by check, credit card or debit card, and was scheduled to last for 90 d√≠as.45 The yard was highly unpopular and hurt even more numerous sectors of the economy Argentina.46 The IMF, meanwhile, he hardened his position and refused to send 1,260 million that was committed to working under the loan known as \\" shield \\", he is arguing that Argentina would not have met their commitments to maintain\\" zero deficit \\" Crisis By December 19, the social situation became unmanageable, with looting and riots in major parts of the country. The President urged people to calma. De la R√∫a responded by declaring a state of siege throughout the country.48 However vandalism did not diminish, and even increased despite the state of sitio.49 Finally there were 27 dead and more two thousand injuries.50 51 the popular rebellion, rather than end, added the support of the middle class historic electoral bastion of radicalism. The same is implied by the freezing of bank deposits. At midnight resigned finance minister Domingo Cavallo and the rest of the cabinet put their resignations at the disposal of Presidente.48 File: De.la.R√∫a.ogv December 19, 2001, President Fernando de la R√∫a declared a state of siege in national chain.

The unions called for strikes to protest the siege. Initially the CTA began a 24-hour strike on 20 diciembre.54 The next day (despite having taken place the resignation of De la R√∫a) the CGT of Rodolfo Daer would join in a strike of 36 hours and that of Hugo Moyano time indeterminado.55 the President finally lost the support of most of his own party, the radical Civic Union, and clung to the small radical sector that still responded tried to summon the justicialismo governance agreement, joining the government. The obvious rejection of PJ decided to De la R√∫a to resign Parliament at 19.45 hours on 20 December 2001, when there was complete but only half of its constitutional mandate. The image of resigning President helicopter leaving the Casa Rosada, stuck forever in the memory of the Argentines. This also had as affected the political party of former president, losing most of the elections held to date, weakening the Radical against Peronism rising, that in the absence of its classic rival came to divide on two fronts. 56 57 De la R√∫a removed his personal effects from the Casa Rosada before quitting. What happened immediately missionary Ramon Puerta, being provisional president of the Senate, and a few days after the Peronist majority in Congress elected interim president by few months, San Luis Governor Adolfo Rodriguez Saa. This had originally supported unanimously by the PJ and should remain in office for two months and call a general election on March 3 siguiente.58 also had the support of Cavallo and bussistas.59 However, opposition parties criticized the it called elections in the midst of crisis or implementing the law of slogans intended for misma.60 was endorsed by union leaders but not the UIA (Union Industrial Argentina). In addition, the week of Christmas 2001 was strong rumor that Rodriguez Saa intended to remain in the government to complete the term of Fernando de la R√∫a (December 2003), which will definitely removed the backing of several Peronist governors they had presidential aspirations, including the Cordovan Jose Manuel de la Sota, Buenos Aires Carlos Ruckauf and Nestor santacruce√±o Kirchner.61 Adolfo Rodriguez Saa in the Oval Office. Rodriguez Saa declared to take before Congress that Argentina would review the entire foreign debt to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate, which was interpreted as announcing captiously financial default, which Argentina declared insolvent to pay their debts. This action was very popular among Argentines and caused an ovation in Congress during his speech asunci√≥n.62 However, the government quickly lost popular support by including in his cabinet figures with very negative image, as Obeid, Vernet, Grosso, Reviglio and Britos. Subtracted backed by fierce internal party and the popular anger just a week of taking office, was presumed to be imminent resignation of Rodriguez Saa. Puerta resigned before Sa√° had made public his resignation. Rodriguez Saa's resignation came a few hours after the announcement of gates, so it did not occupy the presidency again. The sequence then went to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the Buenos Aires Eduardo Duhalde Cama√±o. This transition took place a couple of days while Congress elected a new president. This turned out to be Eduardo Duhalde, who had been elected senator two months before, and had been second in the 1999 presidential election, behind De la R√∫a himself.

The poem was then published in his prose book A Vision in 1925, and was included in Yeats's collection of The Tower, which was published in 1928. The poem was presented in a form of a letter from Kusta Ben Luka to Abd Al-Rabban, Treasurer to the Caliph of Baghdad.  Inspiration  Many believe that The Gift of Harun Al-Raschid was inspired by Yeats' marriage and, specifically, served as an ode to the kind of love that he shared with his wife Georgie Hyde Lees also known as George. For context, one can turn to Yeats' years of obsessive infatuation with Maude Gonne, an English heiress who rejected his marriage proposal three times. She became her muse and the subject of several of his poems written within a span of at least 20 years. When the poet finally ended his ties with Gonne, he proposed marriage to Lees in 1917 and was accepted. The marriage was surprisingly successful despite the 27-year age gap. The poem extolled the ideal love that blossomed from the marriage for it involved the union of two souls. In the poem, Yeats referred to George as a gift who came to him \\"unknown and unloved\\" but became the woman who \\"can shake more blossom from autumnal chill than all my bursting springtime knew.\\" Aside from serving as a metaphor for his marriage and his vision of love, Yeats also loosely borrowed from the fiction of The Arabian Nights to articulate his fascination for the desert culture of the Middle East as well as the occult. He embedded this in a pastiche that also expressed his interest in knowledge. The poet has been vocal about his affection for the Arabian Nights, placing the 1923 J. C. Mardrus-Edward Powys Mathers' translation of the text second to Shakespeare among all the works that most moved him. References Category:Poetry by W. B.

Consisting of an early 19th- century Cape, an 1840s Greek Revival house, and a number of 19th-century outbuildings, it represents a rare surviving assemblage of farm buildings in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Hard Farm Homestead is located in southern Manchester, its buildings on either side of River Road, just north of Muddy Lane. The main house is set on the east side of the street, overlooking the Battenkill River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a prominent two-story Greek Revival temple portico facing the street. Across the street stand a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, along with a barn, corn crib, shed, and chicken coop, all dating to the 19th century. A 20th-century garage stands adjacent to the main house. The construction method of the main house is an unusual form of plank construction, in which planking is laid horizontally (rather than vertically as in typical plank frame construction), with layers randomly overlapping and joined by spikes. The oldest building of the complex is the Cape, which was, according to Hard family records, built by Quakers named Soper about 1806. It was later purchased by Jesse Hard, and it was his son Zera who built the Greek Revival house about 1840. The Hard family has long had a prominent place in Manchester, one of its members operating the drugstore in the center, and another a noted local poet. The Greek Revival temple front of the main house is a particular rarity in the town.

The West Union Covered Bridge (1843), on Middle Island Creek, was a local historical landmark of West Union, West Virginia, USA, until its destruction in a flood in 1950. It was one of more than 100 covered bridges constructed throughout the state in the mid- and late 19th century. History The locally celebrated bridge replaced an earlier one built at the settlement then called Lewisport.\\"County Seat of Doddridge was First Named Lewisport\\", Clarksburg Exponent, 14 April 1940. According to an early resident, A.A. Bee, \\"The first bridge across Middle Island Creek [at West Union] was of hewed logs with a center abutment of stones. In the great flood of 1835 it was washed away\\". In 1842, a contract for a replacement was awarded to the well-known civil engineer Colonel Beno√Æt \\"Claudius\\" Crozet (1789 ‚Äì1864). (Crozet was an immigrant from France who had served in the French military and later taught at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, as well as helping found the Virginia Military Institute.) The new covered bridge at West Union was part of a series of public works along the Northwestern Turnpike which stretched from Winchester west to the Ohio River through what was then all the state of Virginia.Callahan, James Morton (1913), Semi-centennial History of West Virginia: With Special Articles on Development and Resources; West Virginia Semi-Centennial Commission, pp 107-108. Ephraim Bee (1802‚Äì1888), a local blacksmith, magistrate, and state legislator, made all the iron bolts and bands for the bridge, which was completed in 1843. Crozet was a French civil engineer who immigrated to the U.S. becoming known as the \\"Pathfinder of the Blue Ridge\\". The West Union Covered Bridge was destroyed after 107 years in a long-remembered flood that devastated the region in June 1950. The inundation also destroyed homes and businesses, killing more than 20 people throughout Doddridge County. The bridge collapsed into the river below, and, because officials feared that it would dam the flood water and create more problems, the still intact wooden structure was demolished.

Although she had brief career of less than four years, she quickly became one of the most successful artists of her generation to paint in the style of the Western Desert. Her work is now held in several major public art collections across Australia. Life Stevens was born some time in the 1910s. She was born at Makiri, in the north-west corner of South Australia, between what are now the communities of Kaltjiti and Watarru. Her father was a Yankunytjatjara man, and her mother was Ngaanyatjarra, but Stevens described herself as belonging to the Pitjantjatjara. Stevens grew up in the bush, living a traditional, nomadic way of life. When she was a young woman, her family settled at Ernabella, which was a Presbyterian mission at the time. She worked there milking goats. Her husband, who she met whilst living at Ernabella, also worked there chopping trees for use in building projects. The couple later moved to Nyapa·πüi after it was established in the mid-1970s. This area was her husband's Dreaming country (homeland), and although she often made visits to her own birthplace, Stevens would live at Nyapa·πüi for the rest of her life. =As an artist= Stevens did not begin painting professionally until 2004, very late in her life. Her husband had died by then, and Stevens had become close friends with Wingu Tingima. Tingima had already established herself as an artist in Irrunytju. The two women began to paint for Nyapa·πüi's local community art centre, Tjungu Palya, after it was opened in 2006. They often painted alongside one another, sharing creative ideas and travelling to their exhibitions together. Eileen's daughter, Yaritja Stevens, was married to Tingima's son; and the two shared grandchildren. As the success of their art increased, they became the main providers of income for their combined families. Stevens had a short career of less than four years. However, her art had immediate success. Her early works - those before Tjungu Palya - were shown in group exhibitions in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Alice Springs. Her first (and only) solo exhibition was held in October 2007, less than a year before her death. The exhibition, called \\": One Woman\\", was held at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Stevens died on 19 February 2008, at Ernabella. Her funeral was held in Kaltjiti. Her paintings continued to be featured in many other exhibitions alongside other Tjungu Palya artists, even after her death. Stevens' work is held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia, and the National Gallery of Australia. Artwork Stevens' art focused on her family's Dreaming (a kind of spirituality). Makiri, where she was born, is a sacred place for A·πâangu women. In her paintings, Stevens depicted the Dreaming associated with this place, the '. She also painted stories about Piltati, near her husband's birthplace, which is closely related to the Two Snake Men Dreaming ('). The paintings featured in her solo show in Melbourne were all related to this particular Dreaming. Stevens' style was described as bold and dominating. She was said to paint quickly, with a rich mixture of colours, and her paintings were done on large canvases.

Previously, gravitational waves had only been inferred indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems. The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories, matched the predictions of general relativity for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \\"ringdown\\" of the single resulting black hole. The signal was named GW150914 (from \\"Gravitational Wave\\" and the date of observation 2015-09-14). It was also the first observation of a binary black hole merger, demonstrating both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe. This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons. Efforts to directly prove the existence of such waves had been ongoing for over fifty years, and the waves are so minuscule that Albert Einstein himself doubted that they could ever be detected. The waves given off by the cataclysmic merger of GW150914 reached Earth as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton, proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width. The energy released by the binary as it spiralled together and merged was immense, with the energy of c2 solar masses ( joules or foes) in total radiated as gravitational waves, reaching a peak emission rate in its final few milliseconds of about watts ‚Äì a level greater than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe. The observation confirms the last remaining directly undetected prediction of general relativity and corroborates its predictions of space-time distortion in the context of large scale cosmic events (known as strong field tests). It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.CNN quoting Prof. Martin Hendry (University of Glasgow, LIGO) ‚Äì \\"Detecting gravitational waves will help us to probe the most extreme corners of the cosmos ‚Äì the event horizon of a black hole, the innermost heart of a supernova, the internal structure of a neutron star: regions that are completely inaccessible to electromagnetic telescopes.\\" On 15 June 2016, two more detections of gravitational waves, made in late 2015, were announced. Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation. Gravitational waves Video simulation showing the warping of space-time and gravitational waves produced, during the final inspiral, merge, and ringdown of black hole binary system GW150914. Albert Einstein originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916, on the basis of his theory of general relativity. General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass. Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \\"ripples\\" in space-time ‚Äì distortions of space-time itself ‚Äì which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time. It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases. One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes. Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other. At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves, allowing a greater than usual chance for detection. However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen. =Observation= Slow motion computer simulation of the black hole binary system GW150914 as seen by a nearby observer, during 0.33 s of its final inspiral, merge, and ringdown. The star field behind the black holes is being heavily distorted and appears to rotate and move, due to extreme gravitational lensing, as space-time itself is distorted and dragged around by the rotating black holes. Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly ‚Äì by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves ‚Äì or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument. Indirect observation Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates. Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves. For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993. Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision. Direct observation Northern arm of the LIGO Hanford Gravitational-wave observatory. Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth. A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible. In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths. Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \\"beats\\". Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths. In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time ‚Äì a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton ‚Äì as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere. This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors. In practice at least two interferometers would be needed, because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both, allowing the sought-after signal to be distinguished from noise. This project was eventually founded in 1992 as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The original instruments were upgraded between 2010 and 2015 (to Advanced LIGO), giving an increase of around 10 times their original sensitivity. LIGO operates two gravitational-wave observatories in unison, located apart: the LIGO Livingston Observatory () in Livingston, Louisiana, and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the DOE Hanford Site () near Richland, Washington. The tiny shifts in the length of their arms are continually compared and significant patterns which appear to arise synchronously are followed up to determine whether a gravitational wave may have been detected or if some other cause was responsible. Initial LIGO operations between 2002 and 2010 did not detect any statistically significant events that could be confirmed as gravitational waves. This was followed by a multi-year shut-down while the detectors were replaced by much improved \\"Advanced LIGO\\" versions. In February 2015, the two advanced detectors were brought into engineering mode, in which the instruments are operating fully for the purpose of testing and confirming they are functioning correctly before being used for research, with formal science observations due to begin on 18 September 2015. Throughout the development and initial observations by LIGO, several \\"blind injections\\" of fake gravitational wave signals were introduced to test the ability of the researchers to identify such signals. To protect the efficacy of blind injections, only four LIGO scientists knew when such injections occurred, and that information was revealed only after a signal had been thoroughly analyzed by researchers. On 14 September 2015, while LIGO was running in engineering mode but without any blind data injections, the instrument reported a possible gravitational wave detection. The detected event was given the name GW150914. GW150914 event =Event detection= GW150914 was detected by the LIGO detectors in Hanford, Washington state, and Livingston, Louisiana, USA, at 09:50:45 UTC on 14 September 2015. The LIGO detectors were operating in \\"engineering mode\\", meaning that they were operating fully but had not yet begun a formal \\"research\\" phase (which was due to commence three days later on 18 September), so initially there was a question as to whether the signals had been real detections or simulated data for testing purposes before it was ascertained that they were not tests. The chirp signal lasted over 0.2 seconds, and increased in frequency and amplitude in about 8 cycles from 35 Hz to 250 Hz. The signal is in the audible range and has been described as resembling the \\"chirp\\" of a bird; astrophysicists and other interested parties the world over excitedly responded by imitating the signal on social media upon the announcement of the discovery. (The frequency increases because each orbit is noticeably faster than the one before during the final moments before merging.) The trigger that indicated a possible detection was reported within three minutes of acquisition of the signal, using rapid ('online') search methods that provide a quick, initial analysis of the data from the detectors. After the initial automatic alert at 09:54 UTC, a sequence of internal emails confirmed that no scheduled or unscheduled injections had been made, and that the data looked clean. After this, the rest of the collaborating team was quickly made aware of the tentative detection and its parameters. More detailed statistical analysis of the signal, and of 16 days of surrounding data from 12 September to 20 October 2015, identified GW150914 as a real event, with an estimated significance of at least 5.1 sigma or a confidence level of 99.99994%. Corresponding wave peaks were seen at Livingston seven milliseconds before they arrived at Hanford. Gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, and the disparity is consistent with the light travel time between the two sites. The waves had traveled at the speed of light for more than a billion years. At the time of the event, the Virgo gravitational wave detector (near Pisa, Italy) was offline and undergoing an upgrade; had it been online it would likely have been sensitive enough to also detect the signal, which would have greatly improved the positioning of the event. GEO600 (near Hannover, Germany) was not sensitive enough to detect the signal. Consequently, neither of those detectors was able to confirm the signal measured by the LIGO detectors. =Astrophysical origin= Simulation of merging black holes radiating gravitational waves The event happened at a luminosity distance of megaparsecs (determined by the amplitude of the signal), or billion light years, corresponding to a cosmological redshift of (90% credible intervals). Analysis of the signal along with the inferred redshift suggested that it was produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of times and times the mass of the Sun (in the source frame), resulting in a post-merger black hole of solar masses. The mass‚Äìenergy of the missing solar masses was radiated away in the form of gravitational waves. During the final 20 milliseconds of the merger, the power of the radiated gravitational waves peaked at about or 526dBm ‚Äì 50 times greater than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe. Across the 0.2-second duration of the detectable signal, the relative tangential (orbiting) velocity of the black holes increased from 30% to 60% of the speed of light. The orbital frequency of 75 Hz (half the gravitational wave frequency) means that the objects were orbiting each other at a distance of only 350 km by the time they merged. The phase changes to the signal's polarization allowed calculation of the objects' orbital frequency, and taken together with the amplitude and pattern of the signal, allowed calculation of their masses and therefore their extreme final velocities and orbital separation (distance apart) when they merged. That information showed that the objects had to be black holes, as any other kind of known objects with these masses would have been physically larger and therefore merged before that point, or would not have reached such velocities in such a small orbit. The highest observed neutron star mass is two solar masses, with a conservative upper limit for the mass of a stable neutron star of three solar masses, so that a pair of neutron stars would not have had sufficient mass to account for the merger (unless exotic alternatives exist, for example, boson stars), while a black hole-neutron star pair would have merged sooner, resulting in a final orbital frequency that was not so high. The decay of the waveform after it peaked was consistent with the damped oscillations of a black hole as it relaxed to a final merged configuration. Although the inspiral motion of compact binaries can be described well from post-Newtonian calculations, the strong gravitational field merger stage can only be solved in full generality by large-scale numerical relativity simulations. In the improved model and analysis, the post-merger object is found to be a rotating Kerr black hole with a spin parameter of , i.e. one with 2/3 of the maximum possible angular momentum for its mass. The two stars which formed the two black holes were likely formed about 2 billion years after the Big Bang with masses of between 40 and 100 times the mass of the Sun. =Location in the sky= Gravitational wave instruments are whole-sky monitors with little ability to resolve signals spatially. A network of such instruments is needed to locate the source in the sky through triangulation. With only the two LIGO instruments in observational mode, GW150914's source location could only be confined to an arc on the sky. This was done via analysis of the ms time-delay, along with amplitude and phase consistency across both detectors. This analysis produced a credible region of 150 deg2 with a probability of 50% or 610 deg2 with a probability of 90% located mainly in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, in the rough direction of (but much farther than) the Magellanic Clouds. For comparison, the area of the constellation Orion is 594 deg2. =Coincident gamma-ray observation= The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope reported that its Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) instrument detected a weak gamma-ray burst above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%. However a gamma ray burst would not have been expected, and observations from the INTEGRAL telescope's all-sky SPI-ACS instrument indicated that any energy emission in gamma-rays and hard X-rays from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves, which \\"excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer\\". If the signal observed by the Fermi GBM was genuinely astrophysical, INTEGRAL would have indicated a clear detection at a significance of 15 sigma above background radiation. The AGILE space telescope also did not detect a gamma-ray counterpart of the event. A follow-up analysis by an independent group, released in June 2016, developed a different statistical approach to estimate the spectrum of the gamma-ray transient. It concluded that Fermi GBM's data did not show evidence of a gamma ray burst, and was either background radiation or an Earth albedo transient on a 1-second timescale. A rebuttal of this follow-up analysis, however, pointed out that the independent group misrepresented the analysis of the original Fermi GBM Team paper and therefore misconstrued the results of the original analysis. The rebuttal reaffirmed that the false coincidence probability is calculated empirically and is not refuted by the independent analysis. Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. Avi Loeb has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma- ray burst. Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves. =Other follow-up observations= The reconstructed source area was targeted by follow-up observations covering radio, optical, near infra-red, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths along with searches for coincident neutrinos. However, because LIGO had not yet started its science run, notice to other telescopes was delayed. The ANTARES telescope detected no neutrino candidates within ¬±500 seconds of GW150914. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected three neutrino candidates within ¬±500 seconds of GW150914. One event was found in the southern sky and two in the northern sky. This was consistent with the expectation of background detection levels. None of the candidates were compatible with the 90% confidence area of the merger event. Although no neutrinos were detected, the lack of such observations provided a limit on neutrino emission from this type of gravitational wave event. Observations by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission of nearby galaxies in the region of the detection, two days after the event, did not detect any new X-ray, optical or ultraviolet sources. =Announcement= GW150914 announcement paper ‚Äì click to access The announcement of the detection was made on 11 February 2016 at a news conference in Washington, D.C. by David Reitze, the executive director of LIGO, with a panel comprising Gabriela Gonz√°lez, Rainer Weiss and Kip Thorne, of LIGO, and France A. C√≥rdova, the director of NSF. Barry Barish delivered the first presentation on this discovery to a scientific audience simultaneously with the public announcement. The initial announcement paper was published during the news conference in Physical Review Letters, with further papers either published shortly afterwards or immediately available in preprint form. =Awards and recognition= In May 2016, the full collaboration, and in particular Ronald Drever, Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss, received the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the observation of gravitational waves. Drever, Thorne, Weiss, and the LIGO discovery team also received the Gruber Prize in Cosmology. Drever, Thorne, and Weiss were also awarded the 2016 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2016 Kavli Prize in Astrophysics. Barish was awarded the 2016 Enrico Fermi Prize from the Italian Physical Society (Societ√† Italiana di Fisica). In January 2017, LIGO spokesperson Gabriela Gonz√°lez and the LIGO team were awarded the 2017 Bruno Rossi Prize. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne \\"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves\\". Implications The observation was heralded as inaugurating a revolutionary era of gravitational- wave astronomy. Prior to this detection, astrophysicists and cosmologists were able to make observations based upon electromagnetic radiation (including visible light, X-rays, microwave, radio waves, gamma rays) and particle-like entities (cosmic rays, stellar winds, neutrinos, and so on). These have significant limitations ‚Äì light and other radiation may not be emitted by many kinds of objects, and can also be obscured or hidden behind other objects. Objects such as galaxies and nebulae can also absorb, re-emit, or modify light generated within or behind them, and compact stars or exotic stars may contain material which is dark and radio silent, and as a result there is little evidence of their presence other than through their gravitational interactions. =Expectations for detection of future binary merger events= On 15 June 2016, the LIGO group announced an observation of another gravitational wave signal, named GW151226. The Advanced LIGO was predicted to detect five more black hole mergers like GW150914 in its next observing campaign from November 2016 until August 2017 (it turned out to be seven), and then 40 binary star mergers each year, in addition to an unknown number of more exotic gravitational wave sources, some of which may not be anticipated by current theory. Planned upgrades are expected to double the signal-to-noise ratio, expanding the volume of space in which events like GW150914 can be detected by a factor of ten. Additionally, Advanced Virgo, KAGRA, and a possible third LIGO detector in India will extend the network and significantly improve the position reconstruction and parameter estimation of sources. Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a proposed space based observation mission to detect gravitational waves. With the proposed sensitivity range of LISA, merging binaries like GW150914 would be detectable about 1000 years before they merge, providing for a class of previously unknown sources for this observatory if they exist within about 10 megaparsecs. LISA Pathfinder, LISA's technology development mission, was launched in December 2015 and it demonstrated that the LISA mission is feasible. A current model predicts LIGO will detect approximately 1000 black hole mergers per year after it reaches full sensitivity planned for 2020. =Lessons for stellar evolution and astrophysics= The masses of the two pre-merger black holes provide information about stellar evolution. Both black holes were more massive than previously discovered stellar-mass black holes, which were inferred from X-ray binary observations. This implies that the stellar winds from their progenitor stars must have been relatively weak, and therefore that the metallicity (mass fraction of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) must have been less than about half the solar value. The fact that the pre-merger black holes were present in a binary star system, as well as the fact that the system was compact enough to merge within the age of the universe, constrains either binary star evolution or dynamical formation scenarios, depending on how the black hole binary was formed. A significant number of black holes must receive low natal kicks (the velocity a black hole gains at its formation in a core-collapse supernova event), otherwise the black hole forming in a binary star system would be ejected and an event like GW would be prevented. The survival of such binaries, through common envelope phases of high rotation in massive progenitor stars, may be necessary for their survival. The majority of the latest black hole model predictions comply with these added constraints. The discovery of the GW merger event increases the lower limit on the rate of such events, and rules out certain theoretical models that predicted very low rates of less than 1 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 (one event per cubic gigaparsec per year). Analysis resulted in lowering the previous upper limit rate on events like GW150914 from ~140 Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1 to Gpc‚àí3yr‚àí1. =Impact on future cosmological observation= Measurement of the waveform and amplitude of the gravitational waves from a black hole merger event makes accurate determination of its distance possible. The accumulation of black hole merger data from cosmologically distant events may help to create more precise models of the history of the expansion of the universe and the nature of the dark energy that influences it. The earliest universe is opaque since the cosmos was so energetic then that most matter was ionized and photons were scattered by free electrons. However, this opacity would not affect gravitational waves from that time, so if they occurred at levels strong enough to be detected at this distance, it would allow a window to observe the cosmos beyond the current visible universe. Gravitational-wave astronomy therefore may some day allow direct observation of the earliest history of the universe. =Tests of general relativity= The inferred fundamental properties, mass and spin, of the post-merger black hole were consistent with those of the two pre-merger black holes, following the predictions of general relativity. This is the first test of general relativity in the very strong-field regime. No evidence could be established against the predictions of general relativity. The opportunity was limited in this signal to investigate the more complex general relativity interactions, such as tails produced by interactions between the gravitational wave and curved space-time background. Although a moderately strong signal, it is much smaller than that produced by binary-pulsar systems. In the future stronger signals, in conjunction with more sensitive detectors, could be used to explore the intricate interactions of gravitational waves as well as to improve the constraints on deviations from general relativity. =Speed of gravitational waves and limit on possible mass of graviton= The speed of gravitational waves (vg) is predicted by general relativity to be the speed of light (c). The extent of any deviation from this relationship can be parameterized in terms of the mass of the hypothetical graviton. The graviton is the name given to an elementary particle that would act as the force carrier for gravity, in quantum theories about gravity. It is expected to be massless if, as it appears, gravitation has an infinite range. (This is because the more massive a gauge boson is, the shorter is the range of the associated force; as with the infinite range of electromagnetism, which is due to the massless photon, the infinite range of gravity implies that any associated force-carrying particle would also be massless.) If the graviton were not massless, gravitational waves would propagate below lightspeed, with lower frequencies (∆í) being slower than higher frequencies, leading to dispersion of the waves from the merger event. No such dispersion was observed. The observations of the inspiral slightly improve (lower) the upper limit on the mass of the graviton from Solar System observations to , corresponding to or a Compton wavelength (Œªg) of greater than km, roughly 1 light-year. Using the lowest observed frequency of 35 Hz, this translates to a lower limit on vg such that the upper limit on 1-vg /c is ~ .

She was born in Great Victoria Desert, and grew up living a traditional way of life in the bush, without any contact with Western civilization. A member of the Pitjantjatjara people, she painted spiritual stories from her Dreaming. Along with her friend and colleague Eileen Yaritja Stevens, Wingu became one of the most well-known artists to paint in the style of the Western Desert. Although she only began painting less than 10 years before her death, Wingu's work is now held in many of Australia's major art collections, including the National Gallery of Australia and the state galleries of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Life =Childhood= Wingu was born in the late 1910s or early 1920s. She was born at Nyumun, a rock hole in the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia. This is a sacred site for Pitjantjatjara men, and it is associated with the (Eagle Dreaming). She grew up living a semi-nomadic way of life with her family in the country around Kuru Ala, very close to her place of birth. This is a sacred place for the Kungkarungkara (Seven Sisters Dreaming), which Wingu would later feature in many of her most important paintings. Wingu was involved in traditional desert craft from a young age. Her mother and her aunts taught her how to weave hair- string belts and ' (head rings) from hair, fur, feathers and spinifex. She also learned to spin hair-string on a traditional hand-held spindle, and carve wooden tools such as wana (digging sticks), piti (bowls), wira (digging scoops), and ' (basins for collecting seeds). At ceremonies with other A·πâangu families, she and the other girls would paint each other in ritual designs. =Settlement= When she was older, Wingu and her parents travelled by foot to settle in the mission at Ernabella, with many other Pitjantjatjara families. Wingu worked there spinning sheep's wool to make rugs and other items for the mission. While living at Ernabella, Wingu became close friends with Eileen Yaritja Stevens; the two of them would later work together closely. After the community of Irrunytju was established in the 1980s, Wingu moved there with her family to be closer to her home country. Stevens moved to Nyapa·πüi with her own family, and Wingu spent most of her life between the two communities. Wingu's son, Winmati Roberts, became married to Eileen's daughter, Yaritji Stevens. As the two elder women's success in the art business increased, they became the main providers of income for their intermingled families. Several of their grandchildren are now also painters. =As an artist= The community co-operative Irrunytju Arts was opened in 2001, and Wingu was one of its first artists. She achieved success soon after, and she had her first exhibition in Melbourne in 2002. In the same year, she was also featured in the annual \\"Desert Mob\\" exhibition in Alice Springs. Her work from this exhibition was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) in 2003. Even in her earliest work, Wingu's style was unique and stood out strongly against the styles of the other artists at Irrunytju. She used lighter shades of colour with curvier lines, while other artists at the centre were experimenting with bright colours and block shapes. Wingu began to work in Nyapa·πüi from 2006, when the community established Tjungu Palya. Wingu came to support the new centre as a working artist, while still continuing to paint for Irrunytju as well. One of Wingu's earliest works at Tjungu Palya was chosen as a finalist for that year's NATSIAA. Wingu came to work primarily in Nyapa·πüi during the next few years. Most of the time, Wingu would paint alongside her friend Eileen. The two women often shared creative ideas, and travelled to exhibitions together. Eileen died in 2008, and Wingu left Nyapa·πüi; as is the custom among Western Desert people, the grieving move away from the place where the dead had lived. Wingu moved back to Irrunytju and continued to work there. She continued to achieve success until her death. She died on 8 March 2010, estimated to be aged around 90. Artwork =Themes and style= Wingu's painting focused on her spirituality, depicting the Dreaming stories (') associated with her country. Most of her paintings are about the Kungkarungkara (', or Seven Sisters). This Tjukurpa is closely associated with the sacred women's place of Kuru Ala, where Wingu grew up. According to the story, the seven sisters stopped at Kuru Ala while they were travelling through the area in the Dreamtime. They were running away from a lustful man who was trying to catch them. He had supernatural powers and could transform himself into many things. There are many different versions of the story, but Kuru Ala is said to be the place where the man tricked the sisters by turning himself into a fruit tree. The story comes from a group of stars; the sisters are the Pleiades, and the man chasing them is Orion. Although she used traditional images, patterns and icons to paint these stories, Wingu's artwork did not illustrate them explicitly or in a way that is recognisable. The images are always obscured and the meaning hidden. She combined many styles together, including ancient desert imagery that had been passed down to her through sand drawings, rock art and body painting, but by using modern tools and techniques. One critic notes that her style would change depending on where she was painting; her brush-strokes and choice of colour differing between Tjungu Palya and Irrunytju Arts. =Recognition= Wingu's paintings of the Kungkarungkara story were chosen as finalists in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards in 2003, 2006, and 2008. In 2009, Wingu's work was shown in New York City as part of the exhibition \\"I Have a Dream\\", an international tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr.. Her artwork has been exhibited in many other cities, including Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Alice Springs, Broome, Darwin and Singapore. Her work is held in the Gallery of Western Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Australian National University.

His father had three wives, and Wikilyiri is the son of the second wife. He has an elder sister, Wingu, who was borne to his father's first wife. Wikilyiri and his family, who are Pitjantjatjara, were all born and lived in the bush, living a traditional way of life.

Artwork  Wikilyiri paints stories from his Dreaming, the spirituality that defines his kinship with the land. The Dreaming associated with his birthplace, Kunumata, carries the ' (a kind of python) as its totem. Wikilyiri's paintings depict sacred legends about his ancestors and how they created the land around Kunumata. He also paints similar stories about Piltati, another rock hole nearby and a sacred site for Pitjantjatjara men.

Most of her early life was spent living nomadically in the desert, until she and her family were settled at Warburton in the late 1960s. Part of her life in the bush was featured in the documentary People of the Australian Western Desert (1966). She has since become one of the earliest and most successful Ngaanyatjarra artists. Life Pulpurru was born around the early 1940s. She was born near Yankaltjunku, a rockhole in the northeast Gibson Desert. Her family belong to the Ngaanyatjarra people, for whom Yankaltjunku is a sacred place. Pulpurru grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the desert with her family. They moved from waterhole to waterhole in their traditional country. They lived this way up until the 1960s, by which time they were one of the last groups of nomadic people in Australia. By the mid-1960s, Pulpurru's family were camped at Patjarr, which was only a rockhole at the time. They had been forced to stay in one place because of several years of drought, and Patjarr usually had a reliable supply of water. While they were living there, an English anthropologist named Ian Dunlop came and filmed the family in their daily routines. It was later made into a documentary, titled People of the Australian Western Desert (1966), produced by the Australian Commonwealth Film Unit. Pulpurru was an adult by that time. Like most other Ngaanyatjarra groups, Pulpurru and her family were moved out of the desert to settle at Warburton. They were brought there by government patrol officers in the late 1960s. At Warburton, Davies worked several domestic jobs. It was at Warburton that Davies began working in arts and crafts, at the Warburton Arts Project. Alongside other women, she learned to paint using modern Western techniques and how to make glasswork designs. In the early 1990s, a road was built out to Patjarr, and Davies and her family returned to establish a permanent community there (Karilywara). This is where Davies now lives and paints. She paints for Kayili Artists, the community artists' co-operative. Art work Davies paints events and stories from her country, and the Dreaming legends associated with it. Places often depicted in her paintings are Yankaltjunku (where she was born), Kiwarr (where her family used to dig for water), and Mirra Mirra (where one of Pulpurru's sons was born). She works with paints, tjanpi (grass weaving) and punu (wood carving). Davies' work has been exhibited across Australia since 1990. It was first shown overseas in 1998, as part of a group exhibition at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. She also had work featured in a major group exhibition in China in 2011 (called Tu Di - Shen Ti / Our Land - Our Body). In 2007, one of her paintings, titled Kiwarr, was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA). It was eventually bought by the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory as part of its NATSIAA collection. Other of Davies' work are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the National Museum of Australia and the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia. Some of her paintings are also displayed in the State Parliament building of Western Australia, and in a few major private galleries in Germany and the United States.

He was a well-known figure in National Farming circles through his role as managing director, National Ploughing Association and National Ploughing Championships (1958‚Äì1972), through his farming roots and recognised throughout Kilkenny GAA and Wicklow GAA sporting circles for his sporting achievements on the field and contributions to the game off the field. John emigrated to the UK before World War 2, where he played Cricket with Surrey, England. He returned to Ireland and lived in Wicklow from 1942 where he set up in business in County Wicklow, married Lil Doyle, owner of the Lil Doyle landmark pub in Barndarrig, County Wicklow, and where he lived until his death in 1972. He was committed to the Wicklow County GAA in trying to promote locally the standard of hurling and was very active in the campaign for the abolition of The Ban on GAA players playing non-Gaelic sports, a rule that remained in force until overturned in 1971. For many years he was chairman of the Wicklow County Hurling Board. He was also a member of the World Ploughing Association. Biography Sean was managing director of the National Ploughing Association (NPA) from 1958 to 1972, which has a countrywide network of County associations. Sean's greatest sporting achievements were with GAA with his Carrickshock GAA Club and the Kilkenny GAA County hurling team, in 1933. He also played Cricket, which was the main sport in Kilkenny in 19th century with 45 club teams in 1880, and who in a revival after World War 1 lasting from 1924 up until 1931, still had 20 active club teams. He was a brother of Richard O' (Dick) Farrell (1903‚Äì79) a well-known Kilkenny farmer who was a member of Ballyhale Creamery Coop that amalgamated with over 30 other Kilkenny Creamery coops in 1966 to collectively form Avonmore Coop food brand that ultimately grew to become the giant global nutrition entity, Glanbia Plc; and who was better known locally as the Carlow Sugar Beet Factory Agent for South Kilkenny until his retirement after 33 years in 1969. He was a brother of the well-known custodian of social memory and of Carrickshock incident cause celebre, Mary Wallace (1901‚Äì99).http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/2011/0705/646747-radio- documentary-battle-of-carrickshock/ He was also a brother of the Gaelic scholar Fr Pat O'Farrell (1900‚Äì56), STL (Licentiate of Sacred Theology, from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland), who was Professor of Moral Theology, Canon Law & Philosophy at St Kieran's College Seminary and also a long-time Gaelic teacher at the Irish College in Ring, Co Waterford. St Kieran's College, which is more nationally known as the home of Kilkenny hurling, was founded in 1782 and was the first Roman Catholic secondary school in Ireland. Sean has one son, Sean (Og) O'Farrell, who ran Lil Doyle's Pub for many years and former President of Arklow Rugby Club. Associations In 1958 the National Ploughing Association (NPA) appointed Sean O'Farrell as managing director to harness its already evident future potential, and to lay the foundations for the future. NPA, a member of the World Ploughing Association, runs the National Ploughing Championships, and now claimed by NPA to be the largest Outdoor Show in Europe 2016. He was one of only three MD's in its 84-year history, where he recorded a number of notable achievements. A national bread baking competition was introduced by NPA in co-operation with ESB in 1958 and continues to this day. In 1959 he represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to Armoy, County Antrim, Northern Ireland and the first time held there. He honoured his county by 'bringing home' the NPA Championships on three occasions ‚Äì to Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, in 1959 and returned to Danesfort, Co Kilkenny in 1964 and again for a third time in 1970. He attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, Roma, Italy 1960 where he proudly presented a distinctive block of his native Kilkenny Marble as Ireland's contribution to Rome's 'Cairn of Peace' in 1960. A highlight of his tenure was when representing Ireland at 9th World Ploughing Contest, Grignon, Paris, France in 1961 where, in his role of MD of NPA and representing Ireland, was officially introduced to the President of France, Charles de Gaulle. John was a big man over 6 ft. but he always proudly displayed that photo on his pub wall, dwarfed as he was by the 6' 5\\" tall President De Gaulle. Another highlight was the Ploughing Championships in Killarney in 1961, believed to be the first ever Outdoor Show filmed by RT√â National TV with their outside broadcasting unit. It was filmed on 8 and 9 November 1961 for the first ever episode of the farming programme 'On the Land', and broadcast on 1 January 1962. It featured both Sean and Mrs Grosvenor, the local event organiser, and remarkable in that it was broadcast the day after Teilif√≠s √âireann first went on air. RTE Archives released in 2016 a video of Sean as NPA MD at the presentation of the trophy to Farmerette of the Year, Eiline Brennan from Laois, being crowned Queen of the Plough in 1961. He continued to build on NPA's international potential and in 1964 the NPA sent two competitors to Fuchsenbigl, Near Vienna, Austria, where Ireland won their first World Title. The late Charlie Keegan, from County Wicklow was that winner and it marked a huge Irish International achievement for NPA at that time. He was an inspiration to future competitors, demonstrating that the Irish had the standard and the potential to compete with the best in the World. Arriving home from the World Contest in Vienna, the Wicklow man was proudly brought home to Wicklow on an open top bus, reminiscent of his All Ireland winning bus bringing the cup back home, and who was met by bonfires along the roadside as they greeted NPA's first World Ploughing Champion. That was a special day for Sean, as Wicklow was his adopted county. The Irish Times in 2015 reported how the tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 restored, a green Deutz D40L tractor has since been restored to its original condition by his grandson, Michael, after 1,000 hours restoration work. At the National Championships 1964, a new Youth class was introduced for Youths 21- 28. In 1965 Esso became an NPA sponsors and introduced the Esso Supreme Trophy which is still presented to the Senior Conventional Champion annually. In 1966 a new competition was introduced to cater for Students from the Agricultural Colleges. In 1969 the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA) were invited to give demonstrations in cookery and crafts. This also combined with introduction of the Country Markets as the ploughing was an ideal venue to sell produce. Sean held that position until his sudden untimely death in 1972. The Kilkenny People in their September 1972 obituary reported that he was NPA's managing director, a member of World Ploughing Organisation and that the graveside oration was delivered by Se√°n √ì S√≠och√°in, General Secretary of GAA. Playing career =Club= Educated in Good Counsel College, New Ross until Intermediate Certificate and where he learned how to play football; and at and St Kieran's College, Kilkenny until Leaving Certificate and where he learned how to play hurling ‚Äì Sean was probably best known in both Kilkenny GAA & Wicklow GAA hurling arenas as an accomplished county hurler, although he also played football and cricket. Kilkenny was famous for its cricket clubs long before it became famous for its hurlers' achievements and played football at county level until 1911. Sean played club hurling with Carrickshock GAA club, a club founded in 1928 in an amalgamation of local teams to commemorate the Battle of Carrickshock of 1831, an event in history with which his home Kilcurl townland, Knocktopher Village and Ballyhale Parish had important links. The Carrickshock GAA club of that time earned great success in the Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship, winning the competition seven times ‚Äì including a record of four county titles in a row between 1940 and 1943 ‚Äì a record that remained unbroken for 66 years until 2009 when Ballyhale Shamrocks GAA, from the parish of his birth, broke it when winning their 4th title in succession. =Inter- County= The 1933 All-Ireland Hurling Final was Kilkenny's third successive championship decider. Sean was a member of that team and won his only All- Ireland Senior Hurling Medal that day, as a non-playing substitute, beating Limerick by 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì8 points in Croke Park before an attendance of 45,176, according to 1933 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship records. Sean had earlier sustained an ankle injury when beating Galway 5‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì8 in the All- Ireland Semi-final at Birr Park. He had also won a Leinster championship medal that year beating Dublin 7-5 to 5‚Äì5. 1933 was also a special year as he also won a medal for what was Kilkenny's first ever National Hurling League win. Although not an officially recognised achievement, that 1933 Kilkenny team was also the first Kilkenny team to have achieved the distinction of winning the All-Ireland championship, their provincial championship and the 1932‚Äì33 National Hurling League in the same year, when Kilkenny again defeated Limerick by 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì3 in the final. It was only the second time that any County team had completed the League-Championship double, the first being Cork in 1927. According to All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship records and statistics, the 1933 Kilkenny All Ireland winning team was one of the teams from only 5 from 13 Counties who have ever successfully defended their All- Ireland Hurling championship title ‚Äì Kilkenny (13), Cork (12), Tipperary (7), Wexford (1) and Galway (1). =Teams= Kilkenny GAA were the most successful team of the 1930s decade, winning 4 (1932, 33, 35, 39) Hurling All Ireland Finals. The 1933 Team included the legendary and 3 times (1932, 1933, 1935) All Ireland medal winning midfielder, Lory Meagher from the Tullaroan GAA Club, widely acclaimed as one of Kilkenny's greatest ever hurlers. The Kilkenny 1933 All-Ireland winners were captained by two-time All-Ireland medal winner (1932, 33), Eddie Doyle of Mooncoin GAA, who had added a third consecutive Leinster medal to his collection of three-in-a-row of senior county titles of 1916, 1917 and 1918 with Mooncoin. Matty Power from the Dicksboro GAA & Garda GAA clubs, the 5 times (1922, 1927, 1932, 1933, 1935) All Ireland medal winner, also played that day, although Matty had played for Dublin when winning his 1927 medal. Notably, Matty's first medal was won in 1922 when beating Tipperary GAA 4-2 to 2‚Äì6 but it is extraordinary to record that it took 45 more years, until 1967, before Kilkenny would beat Tipperary in a Championship Final again. Another notable member of that 1933 (winning one of his three winner's medals) All Ireland winning team was Martin White, also from Tullaroan club, who is recorded as the second oldest lived All- Ireland medal winner and who died in 2011, aged 102 years and 73 days; the oldest lived All-Ireland medal winner being Jim Power of Galway GAA who died in 1998, aged 102 years and 195 days. The Limerick GAA team of 1933 that day included the famous Mick Mackey (1912‚Äì1982) of the Ahane GAA club who went on to play a key part for Limerick GAA during a golden age for their team, winning three All Ireland medals (captaining twice), five Munster medals and five National Hurling League medals.

It was released as a single from their fourth studio album, Hungry Ghosts. The band released a video for the song on February 11, 2016 that featured the members in a zero gravity environment created via flight in a reduced gravity aircraft. They produced the video with support from the Russian S7 Airlines.  Music video  = Production = The music video for \\"Upside Down & Inside Out\\" features the band moving about in zero gravity created by the parabolic flight path of a reduced gravity aircraft in concert with the song, performing various stunts otherwise impossible at normal gravity, including the use of props such as laptop computers and tablets, dozens of balls, and paint-filled balloons. Two trained aerialist acrobats, Tatyana Martynova and Anastasia Burdina, also perform during the video, acting as air hostesses from S7 Airlines, and performing various aerial acrobatics, including a demonstration of the conservation of angular momentum. Band member Damian Kulash had the idea of doing a zero gravity video for some time, and was excited when commercial space travel efforts were started around 2007 with SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. He and his co-director sister Trish Sie, had been able to ride on the NASA \\"Vomit Comet\\" in November 2012, but at the time considered the possibilities of realizing a music video aboard one to be limiting. In June 2016, Russian ad agency, TutkovBudkov, conceived an idea of a partnership between the Russian S7 Airlines and OK Go that would have resulted in production of a music video aboard one of the airline's planes. The agency further organized a meeting between Kulash and S7 Airlines' representatives at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, the latter party agreeing to provide the band the funding and aircraft support to make their video. Additional support for the video production came from Good Morning America, Facebook, and Instagram. The use of \\"Upside Down & Inside Out\\" as the song for the video only came after they recognized the opportunity to create this video, rather than planning the video when creating the song. By happenstance, the song's lyrics are about \\"discombobulation\\", according to Kulash, and included the line \\"gravity's just a habit that you're pretty sure you can't break\\", making it a perfect fit for the video. Once they had secured S7 and made necessary arrangements over several months, the band traveled to Moscow to develop the video, spending three weeks of training and filming at the Roscosmos State Corporation center. The first week was used to train and get used to the flight patterns while experimenting with various motions and props they could use. By the second week, they had decided on what elements would be in the video and used subsequent flights to plan out the choreography, and used the third week to film the various takes. A representative parabolic flight profile used to create zero gravity for the video In planning the video, they wanted to maintain the appearance of a single take, but also wanted to make sure they did not just use zero gravity for random antics, but for something choreographed. They also had to figure out how to handle the three-minute long song considering the nature of parabolic flight using the provided Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft, which typically provides around 27 seconds of zero gravity. They found they could break the song into segments that they timed with the periods of weightlessness, slowing down the song about 30% for recording to match the flight timing better and help set up more complex shots. Between periods of weightlessness, they adopted still positions, which they used to trim out the periods of non- weightlessness and morphing the transition between these cuts, though still within the same take. The resulting video effectively includes eight periods of zero gravity, taken over the course of 45 minutes of flight time. To get a single take they were satisfied with, a total of 21 flights were made with the aid of about 30 people including the camera crew and the plane's pilots. The shooting took a toll on the band and crew, with Damian Kulash passing out during one of the shoots. = Release and reception = The video was released to the band's Facebook page on February 11, 2016; by the following day it had gone viral, with over 24 million views. Though previous videos have been posted through their YouTube channel, Kulash stated that they felt using Facebook was a way to experiment with distribution of their music to their fans. Adweek writers Christopher Heine and David Griner noted that the band had previous difficulties with YouTube; their 2010 video for \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" was restricted from being embedded on other video sites due to record label concerns, and in 2012, the band stated revenues from their videos on YouTube was marginal. A version of the video had been uploaded to YouTube by S7 Airlines, but had to be taken down within a day of posting due to the video's exclusive release on Facebook. OK Go and S7 uploaded the music video on their YouTube channels two days later on February 13.

He was later a politician from Vermont. He was born in Scotland in 1739. In 1775‚Äì76, before his war service, he was a timber merchant living in Quebec and sustained financial losses supporting the revolution. Military service In January 1776, he joined the 2nd Canadian Regiment of Colonel Moses Hazen. In June, Brigadier General John Sullivan assigned him to take on the duties of deputy quartermaster general from Donald Campbell. On January 9, 1777, as recommended by General Horatio Gates, the Continental Congress appointed him lieutenant colonel and assistant deputy quartermaster general at Fort Ticonderoga. After the resignation of Thomas Mifflin, the first quartermaster general, George Washington highly recommended Hay on January 1, 1778 to Henry Laurens, president of the Congress, noting that his generals thought him the \\"best qualified of any man upon the Continent for the office.\\" However, Congress did not agree, and instead appointed Nathanael Greene quartermaster general on March 2. On April 15, 1780, his brother, Charles Hay, was arrested by Frederick Haldimand, governor of the Province of Quebec, and not released until May 2, 1783. Udney wrote to Washington to provide a character reference for his case in London. On June 24, 1780, Hay was appointed by George Clinton, the first governor of New York, as the state agent to supply provisions for the Continental Army. In 1780, he purchased a house from Hugh Van Kleeck, now called Clinton House, in Poughkeepsie, New York. In 1783, the house was destroyed by fire and he rented the nearby Glebe House. To assist in rebuilding the house, he requested permission from Washington for army craftsmen, which was received. Public service After the war, in 1786, Hay moved to Underhill, Vermont, and entered public life. He was a member of the Vermont Council of Censors chosen in 1806. From 1798 to 1804, he represented the town in the state assembly. In 1802, he lost the election for the United States House of Representatives as a Democratic-Republican candidate on the third ballot to Martin Chittenden. Private life Hay had one child, a daughter, Jane Hay, born January 23, 1778, in Albany, New York. She married Reuben C. Hyde and they had seven children. A son, Udney Hay Hyde (1808‚Äì1883), became a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Mechanicsburg, Ohio. Hay died on September 6, 1806 in Burlington, Vermont and was buried at the North Underhill Cemetery in Underhill, Vermont. See also * Ann Hawkes Hay ‚Äì Also known as Col.

Plot Philip Abubakar, a local branch leader, and six African missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (Elders Menti, Meyers, Gaye, Nyanforth, Selli and Forkpah) are stuck in Monrovia during the First Liberian Civil War. Prevented from conducting missionary work due to the violence in the area, they create a plan to escape to the northern Sierra Leone border, so they can continue preaching without the fear of being killed. Elder Gaye is a Krahn tribe member, which is being targeted for execution by rebels from the International Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL). The local rebellion leader, Ansa, kills both male and female Krahn tribe members on sight, blaming them for the war started by President Samuel Doe, a Krahn, as well as for the killing of his father, mother, and two younger brothers. Luckily for the missionaries, one of the other rebels, Momulu, a member of the local branch, is able to convince Ansa to spare Elder Gaye's life. The missionaries are taken away, then released to join Abubakar and the four other missionaries on a trip to the border. The seven escapees crowd into an old, red five-seat sedan driven by Abubakar, with the Biblical passage \\"Mark 9:24\\" written on the back (\\"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief\\"). Ansa, furious over the missing missionaries, tracks them to the border to ensure Elder Gaye does not leave the country to Freetown, Sierra Leone. At each checkpoint, they sacrifice all of their belongings to pass through. They run out of gas, just as they make it to a small town with a petrol pump, but they have no money left. They trade all they have for liters of petrol to help them reach the border. Once they reach the border, they find out the bridge is closed. Abubakar is also disappointed when he finds that the missionaries have no ID papers or passports, since none of them has ever left the country. The escapees seem to have no hope to cross into Sierra Leone. After praying, Abubakar hears the sound of a ferry carrier. Just as they are about to board to go to Sierra Leone, they are caught by Ansa and Momulu. Momulu tells them to do whatever Ansa asks, then leaves. Just as Ansa is about to execute Elder Gaye for being a Krahn, Momulu returns with armed soldiers, who demand that Ansa release the missionaries. The leader of the soldiers declares that he himself is a Krahn, and when asked whose side he is on, Momulu abandons Ansa and sides with the missionaries. Abubakar and the missionaries then safely cross the border and are reunited in Freetown with President Cunningham, the mission president, and his wife. An end card reveals that they continued living in Sierra Leone for the next seven years, until the civil war ended. Principal Photography The filming was done entirely in West Africa.

Early life RAM was born and raised in Amsterdam. He notes that his first introduction to electronic music and rave culture was in 1989 when he attended a show with some friends. RAM cites Jean-Michel Jarre as a core influence in his material. scroll down Career RAM first began DJing in clubs around Amsterdam in 1995. He began producing professionally alongside Bas Abels, forming the hard trance DJ duo Bas & Ram in the 2000s. After over a decade of working together, RAM, citing the fact that the two artists had begun to drift apart personally and musically, began his solo career in 2009. His first major solo single, \\"RAMsterdam\\", was released through Armada Music, and was eventually on the list of Armin van Buuren's favorite tracks of the year. Over the years, RAM continued to produce singles, including \\"RAMazing\\" (2011), \\"RAMbition\\" and \\"RAMplify\\" (2012). When speaking of his tendency to combine his name with certain words for titles on his songs, RAM states that it had started as a joke, and later became a trademark for him to use on his uplifting trance tracks. In 2013, following the unexpected passing of his wife Amelia, RAM created the track \\"RAMelia - Tribute to Amelia\\" alongside vocalist Susana as a tribute for her. The track received heavy airplay on other trance producers' radio shows, including Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance and Aly & Fila's Future Sound of Egypt. In 2015, RAM released his first full-length artist album Forever Love.

Cayton, Jr., is an anthropological and sociological study of the African-American urban experience in the first half of the 20th century. Published in 1945, later expanded editions added some material relating to the 1950s and 1960s.Rosa, A. J. (2012). The Roots and Routes of 'Imperium in Imperio': St. Clair Drake, The Formative Years. American Studies 52(1), 49‚Äì75. Mid-American Studies Association. Retrieved February 12, 2016, from Project MUSE database. Relying on massive research conducted in Chicago, primarily as part of a Works Progress Administration program, Drake and Cayton produced, according to the Encyclopedia of African American History, a \\"foundational text in African American history, cultural studies, and urban sociology.\\" Synopsis The original text begins with an introduction by novelist Richard Wright in which he relates some of the research to the themes of his work, particularly the novel, Native Son. The preface of the book, authored by Drake and Cayton, provides an overview of the Black Metropolis. The first section of the book then sketches the history of African-Americans in Chicago, up to the early years of the Great Migration, when millions of African-Americans left the Southern United States for Northern cities. The book continues with explorations of the forces which created the separate Black Metropolis, and how the community related to the wider city. Chapters include \\"Breaking the Job Ceiling\\", \\"Black Workers and the New Unions\\", and \\"Democracy and Political Expediency\\", in which the power politics of the newly dynamic community over the wider society is explored. The book continues with a detailed portrait on the life of the community in such chapters as \\"The Power of the Press and the Pulpit\\", \\"Negro Business\\", and separate chapters on the upper, middle and lower classes of the community.Strong, S. M. (1946). Review of Black Metropolis. American Sociological Review, 11(2), 240‚Äì241. The authors identify five overwhelming concerns of the entirety of the community‚Äî\\"staying alive, having a good time, praising God, getting ahead, and advancing the race.\\" The final section of the book is a note by sociology professor W. Lloyd Warner on the book's methodology. Publication history The book had its origins in a research project conceived by Warner at the University of Chicago with assistance from Cayton. With eventual government and other funding, twenty graduate students between 1935 and 1940, including Drake, worked as primary researchers. As many as 200 were employed as investigators, typists, and copyists of various field reports.Peretz, H. (2004). \\"The Making of Black Metropolis\\", The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 595, 168‚Äì175. Cayton was familiar with the high society of the respectable, and not-so-respectable, black elite, while Drake became intimately familiar with various voluntary organizations and working and lower class elements. After the project was completed, Warner thought it might be turned into a book for the university's academic press, but Cayton thought it would get a wider readership with a commercial publisher. Drake wrote most chapters of the book, while Cayton produced the remainder, and Warner, Cayton, and Drake acted as reviewers and editors. The publisher Harcourt, Brace and Company wanted Wright for the introduction, and Cayton, who knew Wright, was able to get him. The book was expanded by Drake and Cayton in later editions in the 1950s and 1960s. It has been reissued by the University of Chicago Press in 1993 and 2015. Critical reception In the American Sociological Review, Samuel Strong wrote, \\"[t]he style of the volume alternates between systematic analysis, literary excursions, and journalistic protest writing. In spite of any critical observations one may direct against this book, it represents a real contribution to the literature. ...\\" The reviewer for The Journal of Politics, Rosalind Lepawsky, noted the breadth of the book but found it confusing, and thought it was missing an emphasis on psychology and would benefit from a more popular treatment.Lepawsky, Rosalind (1946), Review of Black Metropolis, A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City. The Journal of Politics, 8 (4). Southern Political Science Association: 565‚Äì67. Carter Woodson, writing in The Journal of Negro History, found the book a creditworthy and commendable effort. Woodson, C. G. (1946) Review of Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City. The Journal of Negro History, 31(1), 113‚Äì116. Criticism Aimee Cox, in her 2015 study of a group black girls in Detroit, states that although she was not interested in critiquing Black Metropolis, she denotes it as beginning a trend in urban sociology of focusing on the success of black men, and excluding black women. She also argues that the ideas of 'success' assumed in Black Metropolis for \\"advancing the race\\" are primarily economic and class based. Awards 1946: Anisfield-Wolf Book Award in nonfiction.

Early life and family  John Alexander Paul was born in 1780. His father, Lachlan Paul (n√© McPhail), was a Scottish-born Ensign in the Bengal Army. He set sail for India aboard the Chapman in March 1781, but died on 17 December that year, aged 25. John Paul's mother was Drummond Mary, only daughter of Duncan Murray or Macgregor, chief of clan Gregor.Hodson 1946, pp. 140, 483 After Lachlan Paul's death, his widow married John Macgregor (died 1847 aged 83), a banker of Edinburgh.MacGregor 1901, pp. 393‚Äì394 Her only brother, John (died 1784), a Commodore in the Bombay Marine, left his estate to John Paul on the condition that he assume Macgregor as his surname, which he did.Hodson 1946, p. 140Debrett and Collen 1840, p. 360 Drummond Mary and John MacGregor had several children. The sons were: Duncan (died 1881), who served as a General in the British Army and received a knighthood; Peter (died 1815), a Captain in the Royal York Rangers; Alexander (died 1871); James Murray (died 1846); and Robert (died 1801). There were also two daughters, Mary who died in 1879, and Felicite.John MacGregor (died 1847) erected a tombstone in Greyfrairs Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The plaque commemorates his \\"stepson General John A. Paul MacGregor who died in London 5th March 1868\\", along with Drummond Mary, the five sons and Mary, the daughter (see the entry for John at Find a Grave with images of the stones: \\"John Macgregor\\".

Sir John's own son, Evan John, was a Major-General and received a knighthood.Mosley 2003, pp. 2493‚Äì2494Macgregor, p. 402.  Service  Macgregor was appointed a minor cadet of the Bengal Army on 22 November 1781.Hodson 1946, p. 140 The practice of appointing young sons of officers to this rank was introduced by the East India Company in 1770 to recognise loyal service. The directors largely abolished the practice in 1786, finding \\"great reason to believe this indulgence has been much abused and we are thereby put to great expense\\". Macgregor was enlisted as a full cadet in 1795 and arrived in India on 4 February 1797; he was appointed an Ensign on 15 October 1797 and a Lieutenant fifteen days later. The following June he was attached to the 1st Begal European Regiment and fought with them in the Fourth Mysore War (1798‚Äì99), including action at Malavelly and Seringapatam.Hodson 1946, p. 140 After the war, Macgregor transferred to the 2nd Volunteer Battalion and became its adjutant.

Macgregor was posted as Fort Adjutant at Fort William between July 1812 and March 1813, and Deputy Military Auditor-General from 13 March 1813 to March 1830.Hodson 1946, p. 141 During his time in that office, he was promoted to Major on 12 July 1814, Lieutenant-Colonel on 1 August 1818, Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant on 1 May 1824 and Colonel on 5 June 1829;Hodson 1946, p. 140 he was posted a Lieutenant-Colonel in the 23rd Native Infantry in 1820, the 11th Native Infantry in 1823 and the 22nd Native Infantry in 1824, before he was transferred as Colonel of the 22nd Native Infantry in 1829. Macgregor was then appointed Military Auditor-General on 26 March 1830. He was promoted to Major-General on 10 January 1837, but relinquished his post as Auditor-General in March 1846. On 9 November, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and the following September became Colonel of the 54th Native Infantry, serving until his death.

The route began in Wellesley (at the time known as West Needham), heading west to Dudley, where it continued into Connecticut as the Center Turnpike. The corporation was headed by Samuel Slater, Joseph Valentine, and John J. Clark. It was not completed until 1830, and was in revenue service for less than six years as a whole. In January 1836, the corporation ceded the entirety of its length in Middlesex County to the state, and made the remainder toll-free by 1839 when the corporation dissolved. The Connecticut portion of the turnpike, run as a separate corporation chartered in Connecticut, continued in service until 1853. Today, the route is still mostly in use as various public roads, only a short unimproved section between Northbridge and Upton is not in use today. Route today The Central Turnpike route begins in Wellesley, as the modern-day Central Street (Route 135) westbound, from its intersection with Grove Street and Washington Street (modern Route 16). This is how the historical route connected with the Worcester Turnpike (modern Route 9) as its charter stated. It follows Route 135 through Natick, Framingham, Ashland, and Hopkinton. In Hopkinton, it leaves the Route 135 alignment, and continues as West Main Street to the Upton town line. In Upton, it continues as Hopkinton Road, High Street, Hartford Avenue north, is briefly concurrent with Main Street (Route 140) across a multi-road intersection, to Hartford Ave south. The modern alignment then ends where the modern Clubhouse Lane continues, and an unimproved section of the original road continues to the Northbridge town line. Continuing in Northbridge as the unimproved road, it returns to public roads as Upton St. Crossing Route 122, it becomes Sutton Street. Through Sutton it is named Central Turnpike for its entire length. In Oxford, it is modern Sutton Avenue briefly, past the intersection with Douglas Road (historical Douglas Pike), to Joe Jenny Road until the Webster border.

The ROB is based on a national survey of purchasing managers tracking changes in the manufacturing and non- manufacturing sectors. It is considered to be one of the most reliable economic barometers of the U.S. economy and gives an important early look at the health of the nation's economy. In addition to being market moving, the ROB makes an important contribution to the American statistical system and to economic policy. It also has one of the shortest reporting lags of any macroeconomic series. History The origin of the Manufacturing ISM Report On Business can be traced back to 1923. The ISM, then known as the National Association of Purchasing Agents (N.A.P.A.), began to survey its members and share the results with them. Three years later, N.A.P.A. selected Edward T. Gushee, a purchaser from Detroit, Michigan, to supervise the organization's survey group and expand the information they gathered. In 1930, U.S. President Herbert Hoover sought information that could help resolve the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. With President Hoover's support, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce organized a committee to gather pertinent business data from companies that were members of the Chamber. However, after many attempts efforts to gather this information, the committee disbanded in June 1931. Both John R. Whitehead, the newly elected president of N.A.P.A. who represented the association on this committee, and George A. Renard, N.A.P.A's executive secretary, wanted to continue the committee's work. They believed a survey would support the country's economy and help purchasing professionals. Under their leadership, the newly founded Business Survey Committee surveyed the association's membership on business conditions. Renard tabulated the results and sent them to President Hoover. The positive feedback from N.A.P.A. members and the government led N.A.P.A. to continue to survey its members. Other than for a four-year interruption during World War II, ISM (and its predecessors) have published the report since 1931. Manufacturing ISM Report On Business featuring the PMI While the ISM has published the manufacturing report since 1931, in the early 1980s, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and ISM developed the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). The index, based on analytical work by the DOC, adjusts four of the five components of ISM's monthly survey ‚Äî new orders, production, employment, supplier and deliveries ‚Äî for normal seasonal variations, adds in inventories, applies equal weights to each and then calculates a single monthly index number. An update of research performed by Theodore S. Torda, a DOC economist, shows a close parallel between growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the PMI. The index can explain about 60 percent of the annual variation in GDP, with a margin of error that averaged ¬± .48 percent during the last ten years. George McKittrick, a former DOC economist said \\"Not only does the PMI track well with the overall economy, but the indication provided by ISM data about how widespread changes are, complements analogous government series that show size and direction of change.\\" In January 1989, the Supplier Deliveries Index from the Report became a standard element of the DOC's Bureau of Economic Analysis Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The data was incorporated into the index from June 1976 forward. In January 1996, The Conference Board began to compile this index. Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On Business The origin of the Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On Business can be traced to 1996. Over the years, there had been a shift in ISM's membership from nearly 100 percent manufacturing firms in the 1930s to almost 50 percent non-manufacturing firms by 1996 such as: * Financial services * Health services * Transportation * Communication * Public administration Also, by this time, the non- manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy was responsible for about 80 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the primary measure of economic activity. There also was a trend toward the non-manufacturing share of the economy continuing to increase in the future. While the existing ISM Manufacturing Report On Business was well-accepted as one of the primary indicators of overall U.S. economic activity, ISM felt that to fully capture all economic activity and to enable all members of ISM to participate in the survey, a non- manufacturing version of the Report On Business should be considered. As a result, in 1996, it formed a committee to explore the development of the Non- manufacturing ISM Report On Business. By the spring of 1997 the pilot was considered successful. In July of that year, routine monthly data collection began. Monthly public reporting and release of data debuted in June 1998 with the release of the May 1998 data and ten months of data history. The Non- Manufacturing ISM Report On Business is released on the third business day of each month, and is based on data compiled from monthly surveys sent to nominally 350 purchasing executives working in the non-manufacturing industries across the country. The process, content and format of the report parallel that of the manufacturing report with only a few differences. Each month, the survey responses reflect change, if any, in the current month's report compared to the previous month. The report covers: * Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) * Business Activity * New Orders * Backlog of Orders * New Export Orders * Inventory Change * Inventory Sentiment * Imports * Prices * Employment * Supplier Deliveries The Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) which is a weighted composite index for non-manufacturing data (similar to the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)) was developed and first published in the January 2008 Non-Manufacturing ISM Report On Business. This was not available prior to that date because there was insufficient non-manufacturing historical data to develop a composite index. Methodology All the ISM indexes are diffusion indexes and are indicators of month-to-month change. The percent response to the \\"Better,\\" \\"Same,\\" or \\"Worse\\" question is difficult to compare to prior periods; therefore, ISM diffuses the percentages for this purpose. A diffusion index indicates the degree to which the indicated change is dispersed or diffused throughout the sample population. Respondents to ISM surveys indicate each month whether particular activities (e.g., new orders) for their organizations have increased, decreased, or remained unchanged from the previous month. The ISM indexes are calculated by taking the percentage of respondents that report that the activity has increased (\\"Better\\") and adding it to one-half of the percentage that report the activity has not changed (\\"Same\\") and adding the two percentages. Using half of the \\"Same\\" percentage effectively measures the bias toward a positive (above 50 percent) or negative index. As an example of calculating a diffusion index, if the response is 20 percent \\"Better,\\" 70 percent \\"Same,\\" and 10 percent \\"Worse,\\" the Diffusion Index would be 55 percent (20% + [0.50 x 70%]). A reading of 50 percent indicates \\"no change\\" from the previous month. Economists and statisticians have determined that the farther the index is away from the amount that would indicate \\"no change\\" (50 percent), the rate of change is greater. Therefore, an index of 60% indicates a faster rate of increase than an index of 55% (increased activity is becoming more dispersed), and an index of 35% indicates a faster rate of decrease than an index of 40% (decreased activity is becoming more dispersed). A value of 100 indicates all respondents are reporting increased activity while 0 indicates that all respondents report decreased activity.  Semiannual Forecasts  The ISM Semiannual Report, released in May and December, provides insight into both the manufacturing and non- manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. The data in the current report compares information from the previous report versus what current conditions are. This report also offers a forecast for the next six months. Media Most major financial media agencies cover the Report each month on the first and third business day of the month. Articles regularly appear in The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, MarketWatch, MNI, Bloomberg and others. Controversy On June 2, 2014, ISM released the ROB and then revised it twice in the span of about two-and-a-half hours, a highly unusual event. The initial figure of 53.2 was lower than anticipated and indicated a slowing of the pace of factory-sector growth, and this caused stocks to dip instantly. Economists immediately queried the accuracy of the report and determined that ISM had incorrectly applied seasonal adjustments from the previous month. ISM's final correction of 55.4 was almost in line with Wall Street expectations, indicating brisk growth, and the stock market rebounded quickly and closed the day with a modest gain. In a statement, ISM attributed the errant report to a software glitch that \\"incorrectly used the seasonal adjustment factor from the previous month.\\" References External links  ISM Report On Business Category:Works about business Category:Macroeconomic indicators Category:Surveys ","title":"ISM Report On Business"},{"id":"49397441","text":"Various proposals have been made to create a new county in California called High Desert County, which would be located in portions of Los Angeles, Kern or San Bernardino counties. History Due to cultural and geographic differences between the rural and urban portions of Los Angeles, Kern and San Bernardino counties, various attempts have been made in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to form a new county in the high desert regions of these counties. =William J. Knight proposal= In 1998, California state senator William J. Knight proposed a plan to create a new county out of the northern half of Los Angeles and the eastern half of Kern counties. That year, Knight proposed a bill to create a panel to study whether this county should be created. Knight also introduced a bill to eliminate the signature-collecting step required to get the proposal on the ballot to allow local residents to vote on the mater. By placing the proposal on the ballot, Knight hoped that the proposal would not be blocked by legislators who wanted to keep Santa Clarita, Lancaster and Palmdale in Los Angeles County, Victor Valley in San Bernardino County, and Mojave and California City in Kern County. In an effort to place the vote on the ballot, Knight planned to draft an amendment to the California Constitution that would change voting procedures for forming a new county, allowing only people within the boundary of the proposed area to vote on the matter. The amendment would require a two-thirds vote of the California Legislature. The legislative proposal was ultimately changed to call for \\"a commission to study the services received by desert residents of Los Angeles, Kern and San Bernardino counties, and to evaluate the financial feasibility of creating a new county.\\" =Carl Boyer proposal= Beginning in the 1970s, Santa Clarita, California founder Carl Boyer argued that northern portions of the San Fernando Valley should secede from Los Angeles County. In January 2013, Boyer \\"again argued that Santa Clarita and other high desert semi-arid communities separate north of the [San Fernando Valley] secede from Los Angeles County and form our own new county.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the mountain slopes of the Caucasus and Dagestan. It has narrow, evergreen, falcate (sickle- shaped), grey-green (glaucous) leaves, and a short flowering stem just taller than the leaves. Each stem has 1‚Äì2 flowers in shades of violet, with white beards that have purple tips. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris timofejewii is close in form to Iris scariosa, or Iris pumila.Kelly Norris It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stem is normally taller than the foliage. The stem has two acute, carinate (keeled), spathes (leaves of the flower bud). It holds between 1, and 2 terminal (top of stem) flowers, in late spring and early summer, in June. It has evergreen, grey-green, or blue-green, or glaucous leaves. They are falcate, or recurved. The narrow leaves, can grow up to between long, and between 5 -6mm wide. The flowers are very similar to aril iris species flowers. The flowers are in diameter, come in shades of violet, from reddish-violet, reddish brown, to blue-violet, dark violet, to purple. They are similar in form to Iris germanica, or Iris section Regalia flowers. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The narrow, and tucked, falls are obovate. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is white, or yellow, with purple tips. The standards are oblanceolate-oblong, with round tips. It has style branches that are a similar length to the falls and a perianth tube which is 4‚Äì5 times as longer than the ovary. After the iris has flowered, in mid to late summer, it produces a seed capsule, that is similar in form to Iris pumila. The capsule is coated with a wart-like covering. The rhizomes are small, stout and branched. They form slowly spreading clumps. The rhizomes are planted flush with the ground, and have long secondary roots that go deep into the soil to find nutrients. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, (including I. timofejewii,) having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=24. Taxonomy First found in Dagestan, Iris timofejewii was first published and described by Yury Nikolaevich Voronov in 'Not. Syst. Herb. Hort. Petrop.' vol.62, and Bot. Mater. Gerb. Glavn. Bot. Sada R.S.F.S.R. Vol.5 on page62 in 1924. It is not known who the Latin specific epithet timofejewii refers to. It was then published in Fl. Kavk. in 1928, and FL. Cauc. Vol.1 on page 257 in 1928. In 1939, it was thought to be a form of Iris scariosa, then in 198 Brian Mathew classed it as a species related to Iris suaveolens. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 18 January 2006. I. timofejewii is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. It is often known as Timofeev's Iris. Distribution and habitat Iris timofejewii is native to temperate regions of Asia, specifically the Eastern Caucasus, and is endemic to Dagestan, (including the districts of Akhvakhskiy, Akhtynskiy Botlikhskiy, Gumbetovskiy, Gunibskiy, Karabudakhkentskiy, Levashinskiy, Shamilskiy, Tsumadisnkiy, and Untsukulskiy,) a republic of Russia. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level, growing on the dry, rocky mountain, slopes, (normally made of limestone,) or scrubland steppes. Conservation It once had a large population range in the 70s, but by 1981, that had been severely cutback until only 2‚Äì3 dozen individuals were remaining. Then it became a protected plant species, also specimens were sent to various botanical gardens for species preservation. It was then included in the Red Data Books of the RSFSR in 1988 and it is now listed in the Red Data Books of the Russian Federation (of 2008) and Dagestan (of 1998). It was listed as (V) ‚Äì Vulnerable. It currently has a restricted population range in Russia, with only five spread-out locations and up to 5,000 plants. It is currently listed as (E) ‚Äì Endangered. It was threatened by overgrazing, the plant was eaten by cattle, to such extent that a large population of the iris, around the village of Tsudakhar was almost totally devastated between 10‚Äì15 years. Now, only 20‚Äì30 individuals have survived. In the Botanical Garden of Georgia, they have produced several self seedings of the iris and other rare irises (including Iris iberica, Iris graminea, Iris imbricata, and Siphonastilis lazica, to stop them becoming extinct. Cultivation Iris timofejewii prefers to grow in scree-like soils, in full sun, with low humidity (or in dry soils). It can be grown within garden rockeries. It needs a dry and warm summer to rest and to re-flower the next season. The species was tested for hardiness in the Russian botanical gardens of Alma-Ata, Baku, Bakuriani, Tallinn and Tbilisi. An attempt was tried to grow the iris in West Germany and the US (near New York City), but they were unsuccessful, due to high humidity conditions. It can normally only be found for cultivation in specialised iris nurseries. Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Seeds can be distributed around by ants and birds, which take between 2‚Äì3 years to germinate. Like other irises, it can be damaged by slugs and snails. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G. Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Czerepanov, S. K.

The college was an expansion of a summer camp founded by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) on the shores of Geneva Lake, Wisconsin in 1886. The college remained in Hyde Park from its founding in 1890 until 1965, when it moved to Downers Grove, Illinois. Subsequently, the Hyde Park campus was demolished in 1989. Since 2000, the college and the Wisconsin campus are now part of Aurora University. History George Williams College has its genesis in a summer camp founded on the shores of Geneva Lake, Wisconsin by YMCA leaders I. E. Brown, William Lewis, and Robert Weidensall in 1886. This camp was created to serve as a professional YMCA training school. Later, the camp moved to Hyde Park in 1890, where it transformed into a college. The school's Hyde Park campus went by a variety of names during the late-19th and early-20th century: the Training School of the YMCA (1890‚Äì96) the Secretarial Institute and Training School (1896‚Äì1903), the Institute and Training School of the YMCA (1903‚Äì13), and the YMCA College or Association College (1913‚Äì33). In 1933 its name was changed for the last time, to \\"George Williams College\\". During the 20th century, the college \\"was a national center for the development of group work as a profession. It was also an early pioneer in the idea of holistic health, with the integration of body, mind and spirit that was key concept within the YMCA movement.\\" By the late 1965, the college moved to Downers Grove, Illinois; the stark racial divide between the mostly-black student body and the mostly-white citizens of Downers Grove caused racial issues to flare up numerous times. By the 1980s, the school was flagging, and was eventually absorbed by Aurora University in 2000. The original Geneva Lake location is now called \\"George Williams College\\", and is a subsidiary of Aurora. In 1986, the college library was acquired by The Master's University in Santa Clarita, California, and in 1989, the abandoned Hyde Park campus was demolished to make room for new development opportunities.

While Lenartowicz was incarcerated as a political prisoner, she was assigned to medically treat the prisoners held captive in Adolf Hitler's multiple Nazi concentration camps by working as a camp doctor. Lenartowicz was the daughter of a feldsher. As Lenartowicz grew up, she watched her father take care of his patients in the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. She went on to follow in his footsteps going into the medicine. Once completed with medical school, she would go on to her residency at the Anna Maria Hospital. World War II would affect her life the most when she would be arrested by the Gestapo. Life Jadwiga Helena Lenartowicz was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ as one of five daughters of Helena and Stanis≈Çaw Lenartowicz, a medical practitioner. Jadwiga was three years old when her father enlisted for service in World War I. During his time in the military, the family lived off a small pension he received. Jadwiga and her family struggled with hunger; her mother would make sacrifices to wait in long lines to receive food from dispensaries. Four years later, Lenartowicz's father returned from the war. Two decades later, she again saw her father enlist in the military at the onset of World War II. Following the return to independence, the restructuring of Poland led to many changes in society; paving the way for Lenartowicz to enter the medical field. During this time, most women had taken up domestic skills, but Lenartowicz decided to go into medicine. She followed in her father's footsteps, and began her medical training, albeit, she became a physician, not a feldsher. After 6 years, Lenartowicz became a physician in the Second Polish Republic after completing her medical studies in Pozna≈Ñ in 1936. =Education= Lenartowicz attended Poznan University where she completed her medical education in 6 years. During her time in medical school, she was characterized as fun, playful, and silly. She was part of a new generation of educational reform. During this time, Poland underwent multiple reforms to enhance education. Due to widespread recovery from economic hardships from the war, a significant decrease in school attendance occurred. Once her medical education was completed, she began her residency at Anna Maria Hospital, where she would specialize in pediatrics. From her biography, her characterization had transitioned to a more serious and mature countenance with more responsibility at the hospital and the growing tension of another war. =Arrest and imprisonment= During the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany, Lenartowicz was arrested by Gestapo on the night of January 13, 1944, for suspicion of political resistance. She was interrogated many times until she confessed to listening to radio broadcasts. She was sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp as a political prisoner on March 17, 1944. There, she would be known by her prisoner number and a red triangular badge marked with the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù. She was transported from Ravensbruck to Gross-Rosen concentration camp for Jewish female slave labor and assigned to medically treat women from sub-camps for textile factories, fields and production jobs. She was moved to Neusalz slave labor camp in Nowa S√≥l and from there sent on a death march. The women marched around 300 miles to Flossenb√ºrg over 40 days. During the march, food and water became dire, and environmental conditions were extreme; prisoners and officers had very little of everything: food, water, and warmth. Lenartowicz would survive the long march, and her final stop would be Flossenb√ºrg. In mid-April, the American allies would liberate Flossenb√ºrg; Lenartowicz Lenartowicz was free. After 1945, Lenartowicz stayed at a displaced persons camp. As a camp doctor, she was given better opportunity to survive. She was given a greater quantity for her meal, better quality clothing, better hygiene, and better overall treatment. Lenartowicz treated many ill persons that were sick due to malnutrition, working conditions, and living conditions. She had minimal resources for treatment, but she managed with what she had. The youngest prisoner was 13 years of age, and the oldest around 30. Jadwiga was in charge of infirmary and prevented the outbreak of typhoid fever by begging the SS for antiserum. The number of women she saved can only be guessed. On a daily basis, she would treat patients coming in with great oversight from SS doctors, holding her accountable of any person that was not truly sick. In her biography, she often recounts that the ethical lines in medicine were often blurred due to the lack of supplies and brutality of the camps. Once liberated, Lenartowicz continued her work as a doctor and treated the liberated people for malnutrition and various diseases. =End of World War II= Lenartowicz worked at various refugee camps after liberation, until the countries could reassess their borders. In 1946, she was stationed at the Kafertal displaced persons camp where she served as physician and was assigned a rank in the U.S. Army. Kafertal turned into a major centre for education and training of the displaced persons; Lenartowicz helped provide basic medical aid training to guards who wanted to further their job skills. At Kafertal, Lenartowicz also met Colonel Wladyslaw Rylko and married him on June 28, 1947 in Bad Soden, Germany. In 1950, Lenartowicz-Rylko gave birth to her daughter, Barbara Maria Rylko. Soon thereafter, they left Europe for the United States. Thanks to a longtime friend‚Äôs willingness to sponsor their immigration, the family was able to settle into Detroit, Michigan. While in the United States, the couple faced many hardships such as finding work, proper housing, and financial stability. Unable to gain medical licensure, Lenartowicz-Rylko never practiced medicine as a physician again. Her husband died in 1969. She died in 2010 at the age of 100. Biographical book Jadwiga Lenartowicz Rylko is the subject of a biographical book written by her own daughter, anthropologist Barbara Rylko-Bauer. The book was published by the University of Oklahoma Press as Hardcover in 2014, and as paperback in 2015 under the title A Polish Doctor in the Nazi Camps. It received several notable awards including 2015 IPPY Gold Medal in Biography, 2014 IndieFab Book of the Year Award, 2015 Michigan Notable Book Finalist, and 2015 Next Generation Indie Book Award.

Two series of the programme were produced. The first was produced by HTV, and the second by Meridian Broadcasting. Both series aired consecutively between 2 October 2000 and 1 November 2001. Both series were issued on DVD on 11 October 2011, exclusively in the United States by Acorn Media.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DVIOAO Plot Detective Constable Jack Mowbray (Ross Kemp) investigates when the brutal murder of a young woman in Bristol sets off a chain of events, which unbeknown to him, threaten to tear his family apart and change the course of his live forever. When the Bristol murder is linked to a series of recent killings, known as the 'M4 Murders', the investigating team grows to more than a dozen detectives, and just as many petty jealousies and full-blown rivalries. Mowbray‚Äôs boss, Detective Chief Superintendent Derek Henderson (Kenneth Cranham), keeps the pressure on as it becomes clear that the latest killing will not be the last. With little clue or pattern to suggest the identity of the killer, the team are forced to a race against time to find the predator before he strikes again ‚Äî without apparent motive. Mowbray's main sidekick is DC Jim Boulter (Jamie Foreman), a no-nonsense detective who is prepared to stop at nothing to get to the truth. He often comes close to crossing the line when interrogating suspects, often forcing Mowbray or his other fellow colleagues to intervene. Other officers on the enquiry include DI Monty Fowler (Sean Murray), a long-time close friend of Derek Henderson, who is drafted in to lead up one side of the enquiry at Henderson's request. The other senior investigating detective, DI Keith Champan (John Telfer) was specially selected by Assistant Chief Commissioner Ronald Stocks (Ian Bartholomew), who has overall control of the investigation. Chapman's team also consists of WPC Margaret Walkinshaw (Jane Hazlegrove), a rookie officer barely out of her probation period, and DCs Mickey Lloyd (David Kennedy) and Phil Leighton (William Bateman). Fowler's team also consists of DC Linda Harris (Lou Gish) and DC Trevor Richard (Howard Saddler). Henderson's main adversary, Detective Chief Superintendent Huw Owen (Robert Blythe), is the initial investigating officer on the case. When Owen comes close to blowing the investigation, Stocks decides to replace him with Henderson. However, Henderson later comes close to being sidelined himself, until the team identify Robert Jackson (Karl Johnson) as the prime suspect for the murders. Although Jackson is initially arrested by Mowbray, Henderson makes the shock decision to release him without charge. When two further attacks occur, one of which results in a further murder, Jackson is re-arrested and eventually charged. In the beginning of the second series, Jackson is convicted of the murders, but when a subsequent attack takes place, with exactly the same modus operandi, the team suspect a copycat killer - although Fowler and Mowbray suspect that Jackson may not have been their man after all. When a civil case is brought against Mowbray and Henderson for misconduct, Mowbray discovers that vital evidence against Jackson was not discovered during the course of the initial investigation.

He was present as senior Physician looking after the British naval forces under Sir Alexander Cochrane at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Life He was born in the manse Bedrule in the Scottish Borders in 1780, being the son of the local minister, Rev George Dickson. He was educated locally then studied Medicine at Aberdeen University. He received a licence to practice medicine from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1798. He joined the Royal Navy in 1799 as Britain's war with France began to escalate. Initially he served in Holland and in 1801 was posted to Egypt. He was later present at the capture of the French and Dutch islands in the West Indies. In 1806 he was formally accepted as a full doctor (MD) and became Physician and Inspector of Ships and Hospitals on the Leeward Islands in the West Indies, where he was at that time serving. On return to Britain in 1813 he was appointed Superintendent (of medical matters) to the Russian Fleet in Medway whilst also being official Physician to the British Mediterranean Fleet (a critical role at this period). The Czar of Russia awarded him the Order of St Vladimir for his contribution. In 1814 he requested a transfer from the Mediterranean to the very different climate of Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1824 he became senior Physician at the Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth, concurrently being Inspector of Hospitals and Fleets to the entire Royal Navy. His lifelong interest in botany led to his being elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1817. His proposers were Sir William Arbuthnot, James Russell, and James Hamilton. He was knighted by King William IV on 20 August 1834. In 1840, he is listed as one of the two senior Physicians out of a total of ten at the main naval hospital in Plymouth. Upon retiral from the Royal Navy (c.1841) he became a physician in Clifton, Bristol. He is thought to have fully retired around 1845 and returned to Plymouth where many of his naval friends and colleagues remained. In this period he seems to have been much responsible for the improvement of the Naval Library in Plymouth.

Forrester was a founding member of a number of Aboriginal organisations in central Australia. He lives at Mutitjulu, where he has served as the chairman of the community council. During the 1980s, he served as an advisor on indigenous affairs to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke. Forrester has been a prominent political activist on issues affecting indigenous Australians for many years. He has been a strong critic of the Intervention in the Northern Territory, and the lack of economic and educational development in communities affected by it. Early life Forrester was born in 1952 in Alice Springs. His family is a mixture of Luritja and Aranda, but one of his grandfathers was Scottish. Vincent grew up on a cattle station in the Angas Downs area. He learned from his grandparents about the sacred legends associated with his country, and about bush foods and bush medicine. He went through initiation when he reached maturity. As a young teenager, Forrester worked as a station-hand and stockman. Later, he worked in an abattoir. For three years, he served in the army in Townsville. At various other times he worked as a horse-riding clown and a rodeo rider. Forrester's first language is Luritja, but he also speaks English and Arrernte. Activism and politics Forrester has been an activist for Aboriginal Australians for most of his life. While growing up in Angas Downs in the 1960s, Forrester grew angry with what he saw as a lack of human rights for indigenous people. He rebelled against the government's assimilation policies during his school years, and then joined the campaign for indigenous land rights. During the 1970s, after returning from the army, Forrester helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (CAAC), a health care service for indigenous people. He served as a field officer, and then later as its secretary. He also helped to set up the Central Land Council. In 1982, he represented Australia at the first session of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, held in Geneva. In the middle of the 1980s, he helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). He has served as the organisation's treasurer, manager, and as a board member of its television network, Imparja. =National Aboriginal Conference= In November 1977, aged in his mid-20s, Forrester became a founding member of the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC). He was elected chairman for the Northern Territory in October 1981. In this position, he would serve as an advisor to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke on matters relating to indigenous people. In 1979, a group called the National Aboriginal Government occupied Capital Hill in Canberra and set up the Tent Embassy. Kevin Gilbert and other protesters demanded that the federal government enter into negotiations for a treaty with Aboriginal people. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said he would only discuss the matter with the NAC, since it was the only elected body representing Aboriginals. Shortly after, the NAC began working on a draft proposal for this treaty. The government was opposed to the word \\"treaty\\", so the NAC chose to use a Yolgnu word, Makarrata. After his appointment as the NAC chairman for the Northern Territory, Forrester was put on the subcommittee in charge of drafting the Makarrata proposal. The proposal was for a treaty that recognised the sovereignty of Aboriginal nations in Australia. People wanted the government of Australia to deal with Aboriginal nations as it would deal with another sovereign nation under international law. Through the 1980s, the support for this treaty amongst Aboriginal people grew steadily. After talking with Aboriginal communities in his home region, Forrester was convinced that his people were in favour of a treaty. He argued, however, that the negotiations should be done under the oversight of the United Nations. The NAC was dissolved by the Hawke government in 1985. Despite this, planning on the content and principles of the Makarrata proposal continued, with Forrester staying very involved. The campaign for the treaty remained strong through the 1980s, reaching its height in 1988. Forrester did an interview with Kevin Gilbert about it on CAAMA radio in 1989. =Economic apartheid= As more and more Aboriginal people around Ulu·πüu became involved in tourism, Forrester began working as a tour guide at Kings Canyon. He later became a ranger for Ulu·πüu-Kata Tju·πØa National Park, and a mentor at Alice Springs Desert Park, training young Aboriginal people as guides and park rangers. He believed tourism and conservation had excellent opportunities for Aboriginal people. He was firmly against any economic development that comes from uranium mining. A lot of central Australian communities depend on grants to mining companies for income, but Forrester argues that this reliance must be broken. While working in tourism, Forrester became outspoken about the lack of job opportunities for indigenous people living in the centre of Australia. Because of this, he said, the communities were living in poverty, and that the situation would continue to get worse until the federal government began talking to the communities directly. A lot of the problem, Forrester claimed, was due to racism. He called the situation \\"economic apartheid\\". He also acknowledged, however, that most people from indigenous-speaking communities lacked the literacy in English needed to keep a job. Most adults could not read and write, and the younger people did not have enough access to education. As a result, Forrester worked for several years in developing school curricula. In May 2011, the Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara was sold to the Indigenous Land Corporation. At the time of the sale, two out of the 700 people working at the resort were indigenous. At the start of 2013, it was reported that the number of indigenous workers had risen to 170; 35% of them were from Mu·πØitjulu. Despite being critical of Malcolm Fraser whilst he was in office, Forrester later reflected that Fraser was one of the few premiers who sat down to talk with indigenous communities about issues affecting them. =The Intervention= In 2006, an ABC television program reported that children in Mu·πØitjulu as young as five had contracted sexually transmitted diseases and that girls were being prostituted for petrol. Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough claimed that children at Mu·πØitjulu were being sexually abused. This caused serious anger from Mu·πØitjulu leaders. When Brough visited the community in October, Forrester shouted at the minister and demanded that he say sorry. A formal inquiry later found that alcoholism and child sexual abuse were widespread in remote Aboriginal communities of the Territory. In response, in 2007, the government of John Howard introduced a series of measures aimed at addressing the problem. It is often referred to as \\"the intervention\\". The measures were seen as racially discriminatory by many people, including Forrester. He was already a leader in Mu·πØitjulu at the time. In February 2008, he travelled to the Tent Embassy in Canberra to hear the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, formally say sorry to the members of the Stolen Generations. While he was there, he talked with other indigenous people from the Territory about the effects of the intervention. The group then met with politicians at Parliament House to discuss their demands. Forrester called the intervention an \\"occupation\\" of indigenous lands by the military, and demanded that the policies be stopped. He encouraged Aboriginal people in the Territory to disobey the intervention laws in protest. Forrester argued that the social problems can be avoided if the government provides the right kind of schools and services. Despite statistics showing that the number of sex crimes against children in Mu·πØitjulu was going down, Forrester maintained that the community was still in crisis. He pointed to the fact that the population of Mu·πØitjulu had also decreased by more than 40%; people were leaving. Forrester claimed that the government has been too slow in dealing with the source of the problem (jobs and education), and that life in Mu·πØitjulu has only gotten worse since the intervention laws. In 2009, Forrester was made chairman of the Mu·πØitjulu Community Council. At this time, his brother was the Chief Executive Officer of the community corporation, was accused of corruption, and was forced to resign by Vincent and the Mutitjulu Community Council board. They have since not spoken and remain estranged given Forrester's high moral stance. Forrester remained Chairperson until about 2012 when he swapped with cousin Sammy Wilson (they shared the 'load'). He has since semi-retired and lives on the outskirts of Alice Springs with his wife and daughter but is also an elected member of the First Nations Referendum Council for Constitutional Change to recognise Indigenous sovereignty. Artwork Forrester began painting in the early 1990s. He paints stories from the Dreamtime. He has said that his art represents a story and a \\"spiritual legacy\\" for his descendants. Originally, he used acrylic paints, but he has since began using natural ground-up paint made at Ulu·πüu. Traditional methods, tools and techniques are used to grind natural pigments into powder form, and then mixed with a binder to become a thick, sticky paint. The colours Forrester uses in his paintings are the traditional colours used for ceremonial body paint. His painting Resurrection at Mutitujulu Waterhole, done using these methods, was chosen as a finalist for the Togart Contemporary Art Award in 2012. It depicts the waterhole at Ulu·πüu, and the story of (Rainbow Serpent). It was part of a series dedicated to women.

Readmission rates have increasingly been used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. Generally, higher readmission rate indicates ineffectiveness of treatment during past hospitalizations. Hospital readmission rates were formally included in reimbursement decisions for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which penalizes health systems with higher than expected readmission rates through the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. Since the inception of this penalty, there have been other programs that have been introduced, with the aim to decrease hospital readmission. The Community Based Care Transition Program, Independence At Home Demonstration Program, and Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative are all examples of these programs. While many time frames have been used historically, the most common time frame is within 30 days of discharge, and this is what CMS uses.  History  Hospital readmissions first appeared in the medical literature in 1953 in work by Moya Woodside examining outcomes in psychiatric patients in London. Gradually, health services research increasingly examined hospital readmissions, in part as a response to rising health care costs and a recognition that certain groups of patients were high consumers of health care resources. These patients often had multiple chronic conditions and were repeatedly hospitalized to manage them. Over time, hospital readmission rates have become a common outcome in health services research, with a large body of literature describing them, including their frequency, their causes, which patients and which hospitals are more likely to have high rates of readmissions, and various methods to prevent them. In 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) put forth a report to Congress called \\"Promoting Greater Efficiency in Medicare.\\" In its section on readmissions, CMS made the case for closer tracking of hospital readmissions and tying reimbursement to lowering them, citing a 17.6% 30-day readmission rate for Medicare enrollees in 2005, at a cost of $15 billion. The section concluded with several policy recommendations, including public reporting of hospital readmission rates as well as a number of reimbursement structures that would incentivize a reduction in readmission rates. In 2009, CMS began publicly reporting readmission rates for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia for all non-federal acute care hospitals. In an effort to use readmission as a measure of hospital quality, CMS contracted with the Yale-New Haven Services Corporation/Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) to develop a hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure, which it began publicly reporting on Hospital Compare in 2013.  Definition  Broadly defined, a hospital readmission is when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again to that hospital or another hospital within a specified time frame. The original hospital stay is often called the \\"index admission\\" and the subsequent hospital stay is called the \\"readmission.\\" Different time frames have been used for research purposes, the most common being 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year readmissions. Some researchers start counting days from the date of discharge from the index admission, while other researchers begin counting from the day of a procedure or operation during the index admission. = Medicare definition = Though the medical and health services literature has a variety of definitions of readmissions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has created a stricter set of criteria. CMS defines a hospital readmission as \\"an admission to an acute care hospital within 30 days of discharge from the same or another acute care hospital.\\" It uses an \\"all- cause\\" definition, meaning that the cause of the readmission does not need to be related to the cause of the initial hospitalization. The time frame was set at 30 days because readmissions during this time can be influenced by the quality of care received at the hospital and how well discharges were coordinated. Readmissions occurring at a later time may not be related to care provided during the index admission, and might be more related to the outpatient care the person receives, their individual health choices and behaviors, and larger community-level factors beyond the control of the hospital. Inclusion criteria for the index admission include: * The patient is enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and is over age 65 * The patient is alive at discharge * The patient has enrollment information in Medicare for at least 30 days after discharge (this is necessary so that readmissions within 30 days can be tracked) * The patient was enrolled in Medicare Part A for 12 months prior to the date of the index admission (this is necessary to gather clinical information for accurate risk adjustment) Index admissions are excluded from the readmission measure if they meet one of the following: * The patient was discharged against medical advice (AMA) * The patient was admitted for a primary psychiatric diagnosis, for rehabilitation, or for medical treatment of cancer Transfers between hospitals are not counted as readmissions. If a patient is transferred from Hospital A to Hospital B, any readmission within 30 days of being discharged from Hospital B is counted as a readmission against Hospital B, not Hospital A. If a patient is readmitted on the same day of discharge, that is considered a single continuous admission, unless the readmitting diagnosis differs from the diagnosis for the index admission, in which case it is a readmission. Hospital readmission rates are risk adjusted for a number of variables to allow more accurate comparisons across health systems. Risk adjustment is a mathematical method that attempts to account for differences in the patient population and the kinds of procedures performed at a particular hospital so that hospitals can be compared fairly. Risk adjustment is made for case mix differences (based on how sick the hospital's patients are) and for service mix differences (based on the complexity of services provided by the hospital). Risk adjustment is not made for socioeconomic or other demographic differences of the patient population to avoid holding hospitals caring for low-income patients to a lower standard of care.  Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program  Section 3025 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) as an addition to section 1886(q) of the 1965 Social Security Act. This was partly a result of the 2007 \\"Promoting Greater Efficiency in Medicare\\" report which recognized the prevalence and cost of readmissions nationwide. This program established a method for calculating a health system's expected readmission rate and created a system for financially penalizing hospital systems that exceeded their expected readmission rate. The HRRP officially began in 2013 and applied to all acute care hospitals except the following: psychiatric, rehabilitation, pediatric, cancer, and critical access hospitals. Maryland hospitals were excluded, due to the state's unique all-payer model for reimbursement. In the first two years, only readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia were counted; in 2015, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective hip replacement and knee replacement were added. CMS plans to add coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to the list in 2017. A hospital's readmission rate is calculated and then risk adjusted. A ratio of predicted or measured readmissions compared to expected readmissions (based on similar hospitals) is calculated, called the excess readmission ratio. This is calculated for each of the applicable conditions. This ratio is then used to calculate the estimated payments made by CMS to the hospital for excess readmissions as a ratio of the payments by CMS for all discharges. This creates a readmissions adjustment factor, which is then used to calculate a financial penalty to the hospital for excess readmissions. To reach these calculations, up to three previous years of a hospital's data and a minimum of 25 cases for each applicable condition are used. One 2018 study found that implementation of the program correlated with an increase in deaths within 30 days for patients admitted with heart failure or pneumonia, but not heart attack. Causation was not established, but one hypothesis is that the program disincentivized admitting borderline patients from emergency rooms, leaving only the sickest patients being admitted.Penalties For Hospital Readmissions May Boost Deaths, Study Finds  Community Based Care Transitions Program  Section 3026 of the Affordable Care Act created The Community Based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) on January 1, 2011 in an effort to reduce readmission rates. Congress agreed to fund $500 million to this 5-year pilot program, in hopes to aid the Community Based Organizations (CBO) in better quality care. A CBO is a ‚Äúpublic or private non-profit (including a church or religious entity) that is representative of a community or a significant segment of a community, and is engaged in meeting human, educational, environmental, or public safety community needs‚Äù. CBO's are required to provide continuing care after the patients are discharged in one of five different ways. They must start the transition no later than 24 hours after the patient is discharged, provide timely, culturally, and linguistically accurate education to the patient, provide support specific to the patient's condition, review and manage the medication for the patient, or provide a timely interaction between post-care providers and outpatient services . The CBO‚Äôs provide education and medication administration to discharged patients in a way that fits their cultural and linguistic needs. They will review medications with the patients and provide oversight in medication administration. Most importantly, they help to create care plans that are shared between all aspects of the patients healthcare. These care plans are customized for each individual and are communicated in a collaborated information exchange. By having key communication between both the sending and receiving healthcare teams, CBO‚Äôs aid in reduced readmissions.  Independence at Home Demonstration Program  Section 3024 of the Affordable Care Act created The Independence at Home Demonstration Program (IAH) that was announced in 2010 and later started in 2012. It was originally intended to be a 3-year program, but was extended for 2 more years on June 2015. The intentions of the IAH are to use mobile teams of physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, social workers, and others to aid in the treatment of chronically ill Medicare patients at their homes. By using mobile teams with electronic information technology, the IAH can improve coordinated healthcare and allow for chronically ill patients to be seen as often as needed. In order to qualify, patients must have at least 2 chronic illnesses, have been to a healthcare facility within the last 12 months, and have received rehabilitation within the last 12 months. The teams of physicians and nurse practitioners must serve 200 or more of these types of patients each year. By focusing on high cost and immobile patients, these teams can use mobile technology to align incentives and come up with the best possible plan for the patients. In doing this, the IAH has saved more than $25 million in costs since its inception. The top-performing team has even reduced costs as a whole by 32%. Beneficiaries have benefited from the IAH in multiple ways. On average, they have fewer hospital admissions within 30 days, have been contacted with a follow-up within 48 hours, and their medication is identified by their provider within 48 hours. On average, they saved $3,070 in the first performance year and $1,010 per year during the second performance year, and still had the benefits of quality care.  Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) Initiative  The Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) Initiative Pilot Program gives healthcare providers a bundled payment for all of the care done at the inpatient facility, post-acute care facility, and other outpatient services. The range of time for this care varies but the bundling time can start 3 days prior to the acute care. One of the advantages of the bundled payment program is that it incentivizes hospitals not to discharge patients too early, as the post-acute care facility will just have to deal with the implications that come with that. Over a 5-year period, the bundled payment program had saved $35 million for the government. There are 4 different models that are incorporated in the BPCI Initiative. The first model is when the reimbursement is exclusively pay-for-service and paid based on the DRG. The second and third models are a mix of both pay-for-service and bundled payments. Lastly, the fourth model is strictly reimbursed in a bundled payment. As of April 1, 2016 the participants by models were 1 member, 649 members, 862 members, and 10 members, respectively. As is evident, there is a larger transition to bundled payments, as they allow for all of the healthcare providers to work more closely together.

She lives in the Pitjantjatjara community of Ka·πâpi, South Australia, and paints for Tjungu Palya, based in nearby Nyapa·πüi. Maringka paints sacred stories from her family's Dreaming (spirituality). As well as the important cultural meanings they carry, her paintings are known for being rich in colour and contrast. She often paints the desert landscape in bright green colours, and contrasts it against reds and ochres to depict landforms. She also uses layers of contrasting colours to show the detail of the desert in full bloom. Maringka was born in outback Western Australia around 1952. She was born at Kaliumpil, an old ceremonial and camping site on the Ngaanyatjarra lands. Her mother and father died when she was a young girl, and Maringka was brought up by Anmanari Brown and her other relatives. She went to primary school on the mission at Warburton, but ran away to join relatives in Ernabella. She later moved to Kaltjiti, where she finished high school and got a job as a teacher. In the late 1960s, Maringka married a man from Papulankutja. They had a daughter, Elaine, in 1969. Maringka's husband died while Elaine was still a baby. Maringka became a health worker and she moved with her daughter to Irrunytju to work in the local clinic. In the 1980s, Maringka married Douglas Baker (nephew of Jimmy Baker), and they moved back east to live at Ka·πâpi. Maringka began painting in 2004. She paints for Tjungu Palya, a community arts centre based in nearby Nyapa·πüi. She has become one of the centre's most well-known painters. Since 2005, Maringka's work has been exhibited in many cities around Australia, including Adelaide, Alice Springs, Broome, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Overseas, her work has been shown in exhibitions in Singapore, Seattle and London. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Australian National University, and the National Gallery of Victoria. In 2007, Maringka was one of thirty artists featured in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial exhibition, Culture Warriors, at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.

She produces her works using intaglio methods of printmaking. The designs are drawn by etching and linocutting, and the prints are done on paper. Nura was born in about 1933, in north-western South Australia. The place of her birth was Tjitapiti, which is northeast of Nyapa·πüi, and close to what is now the outstation of Angatja. Nura was a \\"bush baby\\" (she was born in the bush), and her family lived a traditional, nomadic way of life in the desert around Angatja. Nura was a baby when her parents and elder brother settled at Ernabella, which was a Presbyterian mission at the time. Nura worked in crafts from a young age. Growing up at the mission, she learned weaving and knitting to make rugs and clothes. She also learned to make artistic objects from wood carving and poker work. She began painting around 2000, producing acrylic paintings on canvases. She started using printmaking techniques a few years later. Most of Nura's designs depict stories from her childhood. They are usually images of children or animals, such as dingos and goats, but she is best known for her depictions of ' (spirits). These are from traditional Pitjantjatjara stories told to children to make sure they stay away from trouble. Her style is often described as \\"child-like\\", because the shapes are very simple and look like a child's drawings. Works by Nura have been featured in exhibitions since 2000, in many of Australia's major cities and also in cities in the United Kingdom. Her work is held in several major collections, including Flinders University, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and Parliament House in Canberra.

Early life Jimmy Baker was born some time around 1915. He was born at Malumpa, an old camping site near what is now Ka·πâpi in north- western South Australia. His name at the time was Pintjutjara. He had a brother, Toby Ginger Baker, and a sister, Tjuwilya. He and his family lived a traditional, nomadic life in the desert, and had no contact with Euro- Australian society. Their first encounter with White people was in the early 1920s, with a group of Christian missionaries travelling from Ernabella to Warburton. On their way back, the missionaries tried to persuade the family to come with them to Ernabella, but Jimmy's father, Tjuwintjara, was not ready to give up life in the bush. When Jimmy was a teenager, his father encountered an expedition led by anthropologist Ted Strehlow. Strehlow gave Tjuwintjara food in exchange for his help as a guide. Strehlow also gave the family a letter that entitled them to access the food stores at Ernabella. Because of this, the family decided to leave the desert behind, and they finally settled at Ernabella a short time after 1930. Jimmy's father remained very traditional. He was well known for his survival skills and knowledge of the desert. In 1939, he acted as a guide for Strehlow and Charles Duguid on their expedition to the Petermann Ranges. After settlement At Ernabella, Jimmy's first job was baking bread. Because of this, he was given the surname \\"Baker\\", and he chose the Christian name of \\"Jimmy\\" himself. Later, he got a job building fences on nearby stations, first at Kenmore Park and then Everard Park. In the late 1930s, Jimmy married a woman named Nyinmungka, who he met while working at Everard Park. They moved back to Kenmore Park. They had one son and two daughters: Anton, Kay and Marita. All of Jimmy's children became artists and founding members of the Tjunga Palya centre. In his later years, Jimmy became an important ngangka·πüi (traditional healer). He travelled far around central Australia, applying his traditional knowledge and skills. He and his wife lived in Kaltjiti, but Jimmy wanted to move closer to his family's homeland near Malumpa. In the early 1990s, he and two of his nephews, Ivan and Douglas Baker, established Ka·πâpi as an outstation for their families. Artwork Jimmy did not begin painting until 2004, six years before his death. Until about the 1980s, men's traditional art was widely considered sacred by Pitjantjatjara, and was not displayed in public like women's art was. Pintupi men in the north began painting in the 1970s, at Papunya Tula. This was considered sacrilege by other Western Desert groups, because knowledge of sacred law is considered dangerous. The sacred images in the paintings were obscured, though, and encrypted (hidden) by dots and lines. When the art style became popular, more and more Pitjantjatjara men began to paint. Baker began painting as a way to preserve his stories and culture. Because he was a ngangka·πüi, he knew more about his country's sacred Dreaming stories than most. His paintings represent stories from the time of creation that dictate sacred law (Tjukurpa) for Pitjantjatjara people. Although he began very late in life, his paintings quickly became well known. The first major exhibition to show his work was an annual group exhibition called \\"Desert Mob\\", in Alice Springs. It first featured his work in 2005, and again every year after that until 2009. In 2007, Baker was one of thirty artists featured in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial exhibition, Culture Warrior. It showed three of his paintings: Katatjita (2006), Wanampi Kutjara (2006) and Piltati (2007). He was interviewed on South Australian television, speaking through a translator. Having only painted for six years, Baker produced only a small number of works. His works are rare, and were considered valuable even when he was alive. Most of them are acrylic paintings done on canvas (cotton duck). He uses rich colours in the \\"dot\\" style that has become classical in Western Desert art. Jimmy died in 2010, from a problem with his lungs. His work is major several major public and private collections in Australia, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. As well as his children, several of his grandchildren are also well-known artists painting for Tjungu Palya.

She is a painter of the Western Desert style of art, and paints for the Papunya Tula school. Her husband, Warlimpirrnga, is also a well-known artist. They were both members of the famous Pintupi Nine, the last group of Aborigines living a traditional way of life in Australia. Yalti was born in the Great Sandy Desert, sometime around 1970. She and her family lived as nomads in the desert, travelling along the western side of Lake Mackay. Most other Pintupi families had moved into settlements during the 1950s, but Yalti's father kept the family away from these. Her parents were Lanti (or \\"Joshua\\") and Nanu. She has an older brother, Tamayinya, and a younger sister, Yukultji. She married Warlimpirrnga sometime during the early 1980s, possibly when she was as young as 12. She and her family came out of the desert in 1984. She now lives at Kiwirrkurra, and has two sons and two daughters. Yalti finished her first paintings for Papunya Tula in June 1996. She makes acrylic paintings of landscapes associated with Pintupi dreaming stories. Her paintings are of important places in her country, around Marruwa, Laurryi, Wirrulnga and Patjarr.

She is a painter of the Papunya Tula group of artists. She is part of a generation of female painters who followed in the footsteps of the original male Papunya Tula artists. Napangati grew up around Marruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay. She grew up without knowing about places like Kiwirrkurra, or her relatives living there. She had never met anyone from outside her own family. Her family lived a completely traditional nomadic way of life. Her father, Lanti (or \\"Joshua\\"), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Napangati's father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as \\"the last nomads\\". Napangati was the youngest of this group. Napangati experienced major culture shock when first coming out of the desert. She often found new things difficult to understand. In an interview once, she remembers, \\"I hopped into a car and crouched down, and I saw the trees move. I was frightened. I was scared. I jumped right off because the trees were racing around the place.\\" Napangati began painting in the early 1990s. Before this, she had watched her brothers painting and later decided to try it for herself. She paints stories and songs from her and her mother's dreaming. These stories are about her traditional country, around Marruwa, Ngaminya and Marrapinti. Her paintings are shown in several public collections in Australia. Her work has been shown in over 80 exhibitions in Australia and overseas. She was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2012, Napangati won the Alice Prize, an award for Australian artists in Alice Springs. In 2018, she won the Wynne Prize for landscape painting. In 2018 Napangati's work was included in the exhibition Marking the Infinite: Contemporary Women Artists from Aboriginal Australia at The Phillips Collection.

Early life Tjapaltjarri was born in the late 1960s or early 1970s. He was born at Marua, near Lake Mackay. He grew up living a nomadic, traditional way of life in the desert. His family had never come into contact with modern, Euro-Australian society. He had never seen a white person, and his family always thought the aeroplanes they saw flying overhead were ghosts or spirits. Before Tjapaltjarri was born, his father Lanti had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo. But he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Tjapaltjarri's mother was named Watjunka, and he was Watjunka's only child. He also had two other mothers, Papunya and Nanu, who were his father's secondary wives (and his mother's sisters). His father and Watjunka both died when he was young. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. He and his family became known as the last Aborigines living a traditional nomadic way of life in Australia. He is now married with two children, and lives between Kiwirrkura, Alice Springs, and Yuendumu, where his wife is from. He paints at Hoppy's Camp, outside Alice Springs. Painting Tjapaltjarri began painting in December 1987, a few years after settling at Kiwirrkurra. He was introduced to painting by his cousin Warlimpirrnga. He taught Tjapaltjarri about using paints and canvas. Tjapaltjarri joined the Papunya Tula artists, and he, Thomas and Warlimpirrnga eventually gained fame internationally as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Although he normally paints using Tjapaltjarri as a surname, Tjapaltjarri's skin name is Tjapangati. His paintings depict scenes from the Tingari cycle (sacred and secret songs about the ancestors of the Pintupi). He uses only four colours at most, sticking to earthy, ochre colours to reflect the desert landscape. The places he depicts in his paintings are part of his traditional country, including Marruwa, Mintarnpi, Wanapatangu, Mina Mina, Naami, Yarrawangu and Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay). These were places where the ancestors stopped for ceremonies when travelling across the country. Tjapaltjarri uses acrylic paintings on canvas. His early work was in the flowing \\"dot\\" style of painting typical of the Papunya Tula artists. His style became different during the late 1990s, and began to paint rigid rectangles, replacing dotted lines with thick, solid lines. His first exhibition was in 1997, for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in Darwin. Most of his work is shown in exhibitions alongside the works of other Aboriginal artists. He has paintings in permanent collections in Australia, Europe and the United States. Tjapaltjarri paints the most out of the three Tjapaltjarri brothers. When painting regularly, he earns up to AU$2000 a day. His paintings often sell for many thousands of dollars.

The product was launched in April 2013, after one year of piloting.  Overview  Bebapay platform worked using near field communication (NFC). Commuters of public transport would have their bus fare charged off their BebaPay prepaid cards by the bus conductors by simply \\"tapping\\" the card with a handheld android device. The service was introduced in line with the Kenya Gazette notice that was to disallow the use of cash for bus fare payments from July 2014. The rationale of the system was to help cut loss of income by transport operators due to theft by their staff, paying of bribes to traffic officers and greater accountability which would boost tax collection. Users also benefited from being able to access their online account. In September 2013, Google partnered with De La Salle University (DLSU) and Bank of the Philippine Islands to launch BebaPay service in Manila, Philippines. In Philippines, the service was to be used as a prepaid card by students of DLSU. The cards would be used for transport, purchase of food and other necessities.  Shutdown  In April 2014, BebaPay exited the Philippines market only six months after it had launched into that market. BebaPay was discontinued on March 15, 2015 at which point the service had over 700,000 active users in Nairobi. These users were taken up by Equity Bank through its prepaid MasterCard. The service failed mainly due to the failure by the government to disallow the use of cash for bus fare payments as was previously announced and stiff competition from other cashless solutions such as Pepea from KCB, Tangaza Pesa PSV card, My 1963 from Safaricom and M-Nauli from Co-op Bank.

History Knitted garments found in Norway have been dated as far back as between 1476 and 1525. Some of the most well known sweater patterns attributed to Norwegian colorwork knitting are the Setesdal Lusekofte and the Fana Fanacofte patterns. Selbu in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county is also well known for the Selburose pattern motif. Selbu mittens first appeared as a vertical column of two snowflakes on the front side of the mittens. The origin of these mittens is attributed to a young girl named Marit Emstad who in 1857 attended church wearing what we now know as Selbu mittens, effectively sparking the imagination of knitters at the time who had never seen anything like it before. Today there are over 300 registered mitten patterns attributed to Selbu. There are several brands of Norwegian yarn available today for knitters, including Dale of Norway and Rauma Garn. Dale of Norway has been a manufacturer of ready wear sweaters which have been worn by Norway's Olympic athletes since 1956. Many of their sweater patterns most closely associated with knitted ski sweaters have been published in English by the manufacturing company. The heritage of Norwegian knitting has been preserved, documented and translated into English language history and pattern books that are available to modern knitters, mostly notably by the author Annemor Sundb√∏.

It has a maximum capacity of 40,000.http://www.xnpearol- xwa.org/uc_4252_1.html The stadium is built with all FIFA standards taken into account, plus the possibility of a reform and an expansion in mind; thought of as possible host for a proposed 2030 FIFA World Cup by Uruguay.  History  = Background = Projects to own a stadium date back to the 20th century, but never managed to materialize. Although the club already owned the Estadio Contador Damiani (former Las Acacias) since 1916, it is currently not approved for Uruguayan Primera Divisi√≥n matches by authorities, due to lack of security, and it is used by the club's youth divisions instead. The first project dates back to 1933, when the team presented a project to build a stadium near Montevideo's promenade, same place in which now the popular Teatro de Verano is found. Half a century later, in 1998, the club announced plans, presenting a real life model, of a stadium to be built in the Franklin D. Roosevelt park near Avenida Gianattassio, in Canelones. On the successive years, under the command of club president Jos√© Pedro Damiani, continuous projects were presented, which all planned for a 40 thousand seat stadium.  The Parque Rod√≥ Stadium  Considered the first project held by Pe√±arol for a club-owned stadium, it is registered in the club's 1933 Annual Report & Financial Statements, in which '(...)it is proposed and less than solved the practical execution of Parque Rod√≥ Stadium'. In this document, a 30 thousand capacity multi-purpose stadium is planned. It was thought to hold basketball, cycling, boxing and volleyball events, apart from the club's most successful and popular sport, football.  The 'Damiani-Moore' Stadium  Presented in 2005. It would be located in Canelones, with an approximate capacity of 32.500 people. It was shaped similarly to Pe√±arol's then local stadium, Estadio Centenario, and its stands were to be named in honour of the club's greatest glories, such as, for example Obdulio Varela, Juan Schiaffino, Fernando Morena, Pablo Bengoechea, Diego Aguirre, Alberto Spencer and Ladislao Mazurkiewicz.  Project to build a stadium in the Franklin D. Roosevelt park  Presented in 2011, the project implied a U$S 13 million investment, with an initial capacity of 35.000 spectators, open to further expansions. A proposal was presented to the local government (Intendencia Departamental de Canelones), with an estimate of 25.286 tickets to be sold at the inaugural match. Ultimately, doubts originated if the site (donated by a private to be used as a public park) was allowed to be destined to the project, plus environmental impact studies and neighbour protests against the stadiums construction, ended with the cancellation of the project.  Stadium buyout projects  As a result of the several failed attempts to build its own stadium, Pe√±arol tried, several times over the last three decades, to buy and take charge of already built stadiums. In 1993 a proposal was made to take charge of the Estadio Charr√∫a, of municipal property, giving away the Estadio Contador Damiani as part of the payment. It did not succeed. Then again, in 2001, Pe√±arol tried to buy said stadium again, pretending to expand the venue from a 10.000 to 30.000 spectators, in an usufruct of thirty years. Another usufruct was then planned, this time involving Estadio Centenario, over a deal with Uruguays football association (AUF), the Stadium Official Administrators (CAFO) and the municipal government. These projects, never got past the proposals, which got withdrawn or denied. = Stadium construction = In September 2012, president Juan Pedro Damiani presented plans to build a 40,005 people stadium on the outskirts of Montevideo, near recently completed route 102. It would comply with all FIFA standards and regulations, having a 105 x 68 metres football pitch, a high-technology digital scoreboard, conference rooms for up to 70 people, 107 executive boxes, plus the club's headquarters and museum would be moved to the new stadium. As the club lacked sufficient funds to make an operation of such magnitude, a joint venture was formed with local football television rights holders Tenfield; and a loan of about U$S 20 million by Banco de la Rep√∫blica Oriental del Uruguay, Uruguay's statal bank, was agreed. The deal implied Tenfield owned the rights to decide the field's commercial name, and all of the static & adboard publicity shown. On December 19th, 2013 a symbolic foundation stone, which can now be found by the main building's hall, was laid by the club president, box holders and club celebrities. By 10 February 2014, the construction broke ground. Construction was expected to be concluded by September 2015, but due to several factors was delayed up to December. It was then finally delayed one more time to be finally inaugurated by March, 2016.  Inauguration  In February 2016, details about the grounds inauguration were released. According to initial planning, an important show was meant to take place was on March 27, 2016, with about four-thousand artists and popular ex-footballers invited, such as Jorge Drexler, Fito P√°ez, Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, N√©stor Gon√ßalves, Fernando Morena, Walter Olivera, and also the presence of Uruguayan president Tabar√© V√°zquez. The final date was then moved onto March 30. = Inaugural match = Diego Forl√°n scored the first goal ever in the stadium. The stadium was inaugurated on March 28, 2016 with a friendly match against then current Copa Libertadores champions Club Atl√©tico River Plate from Argentina. Pe√±arol won 4‚Äì1 and Diego Forl√°n scored the first goal at the new stadium. On May 26, 1938 Club Atl√©tico River Plate inaugurated their stadium Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti against Pe√±arol, which the locals won by 3‚Äì1. That's part of the reason why Pe√±arol opted for River Plate as their invitee. = Inaugural ceremony: ¬¥La Fiesta del Siglo¬¥ = Cuerda de tambores on the Fiesta del Siglo An approximately 2 hour-and-a-half-long show was held on March 30, 2016, divided into 4 particular segments about the club's history, which involved a cuerda de tambores of about 200 musicians, special presence of club legends such as Fernando Morena or Pablo Bengoechea, an open-air act about the club's history described as a modern opera, giant mobile structures akin to football players, music acts by Jorge Drexler -who wrote a song for the occasion, named ¬¥La vida entera¬¥ Hugo Fattoruso, Fito Pa√©z, Mandrake Wolf and others; and a final closure with the presence of all of the academy players following a choreography accompanied by 3-D mapped projections on the pitch. Rub√©n Rada and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas were also expected to star, but had to cancel due to calendar issues. = First official match = The first official match was held on Saturday, April 9, with Pe√±arol hosting Danubio on the closing phase of the Campeonato Uruguayo 2015/2016. The locals won 2‚Äì1, with Nicol√°s Albarrac√≠n scoring the first official goal.  Stands  With a total capacity of 43,000 spectators, the stadium is divided in the Frank Henderson (North and Main), Washington Cataldi (West), Jos√© Pedro Damiani (South), and Gast√≥n G√ºelfi (East) stands, named after notorious club presidents. = Frank Henderson stand = Capacity: 12.200 seated leftthumb273x273pxView from the Frank Henderson Stand. From left to right: G. Guelfi, J.P. Damiani and W. Cataldi stands. Named after founder and first club president Frank Henderson, it is a two-storied all-seater stand that runs along the north edge of the pitch, in addition to three rows of boxes, destinated to VIPs, invitees, executive and familiar uses. Finally, a fourth -and final- row is destinated to broadcasting services. Because of this, it is denominated as the Main or Official stand. As of the time, it is the only all- seater stand, mainly designated to season-ticket holders, and thus, the most expensive of them all. The seats are arranged and coloured in such a way that a mosaic depicting the Campe√≥n del Siglo ‚Äì a motto adopted by fans in the late 20th century, which the club adopted as an institutional trademark after being awarded as Best southamerican team in the XX century by the IFFHS ‚Äì logo is formed. The stand also features the largest concourse area in the stadium, containing the club's headquarters, museum, administrative offices, first aid rooms, and conference rooms. It does also contain both the local and visitor reception areas, four dressing rooms (a pair for each team: one for the first team and the other for the youth team), and the dugouts. Being the main face of the stadium, monuments of all of the club glories depicting photographies, telling their club history and listing their achievements were erected right before the stadium's entrance, in a passage denominated Paseo de las Glorias. A historic Henschel train engine from the 1950s was also placed at the stadium's entrance, in a manner to symbolize the club's tight relationship with locomotives at its origins. This action caused controversy between train enthusiasts and AFE, the state's rail administration; as the train's purchase was authorised by a state official which was, at the same time, a member of the club's Board of Directors. = Washington Cataldi stand = Capacity: 8.400 standing Named after deceased club president Washington Cataldi, under whom -cooperating with Gast√≥n G√ºelfi- Pe√±arol reigned locally and internationally, obtaining two Intercontinental Cups (1961, 1966), three Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica (1960, 1961, 1966), and nine Primera Divisi√≥n trophies (1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968) in which the club achieved its first Golden Quinquenio by winning five consecutive titles. The stand runs along the western edge of the pitch, and is divided into two tiers, designated for local standing fans; and lacks any type of luxuries except for bathrooms and some food locals. Because of this, it is one of the denominated Popular stands (along with the eastern stand), and its pricings are way cheaper than both the north mainstand and the southern Family stand. = Gast√≥n G√ºelfi stand = Capacity: 8.400 standing Named after deceased club president Gast√≥n G√ºelfi, who along Gast√≥n G√ºelfi, gave Pe√±arol huge local and international successes, it is a two-tiered stand designated for both local and visitor standing fans, whose proportion is decided by the club along with local authorities based on the magnitude of the event. It does also belong to the Popular type of stand, lacking any luxury except for basic services, and being one of the cheapest along the Washington Cataldi stand. It runs along the eastern edge of the pitch. Pe√±arol does also own a basketball arena named after said person, the Palacio Pe√±arol Contador Gast√≥n G√ºelfi. = Jos√© Pedro Damiani stand = Capacity: 14.000 seated A two-tiered stand, destinated to families (thus the Familiar stand), it is a standing stand for the moment, although club president Juan Pedro Damiani has repeatedly stated it would be modified into an all-seater stand by September 2016. As of June 4, 2016, open boxes were made available for season-ticket holders. Because of this, pricings are moderate with focus on families. The stand is named after deceased president and father of actual president Juan Pedro Damiani, whose management abilities saved the club from economical crisis and brought another Quinquenio to the club. Pe√±arol does own another field named after him, popularly known as Las Acacias.  Transport  The stadium is located approximately 16.6 kilometres (10.3 miles) from the centre of Montevideo. It is accessible by car from routes 102 and 8, with parking lots are available in the stadium premises, plus future parking lots have started construction. Lateral streets are dirt-based, although their surfacing has started. Bus lines 103, 316, DM1 y D8 serve the stadium from Montevideo, while 703 704 724 757 serve the stadium from Costa de Oro, with their respective bus stops located 507 and 473 meters from the venue. A bus terminal is pending construction in order to shorten loading times and alleviate traffic congestion.

The shows feature never-before seen or heard multimedia stories performed on stage by writers, radio producers, photographers, filmmakers, and musicians. The events are not live- streamed or recorded for later viewing. Pop-Up Magazine events are currently produced two to three times a year and routinely sell out. There are usually around 12 short stories. The production runs approximately 100 minutes. Each story is designed specifically for a live format, often using media considered unconventional for journalism. Many stories are performed alongside photographs, animations and illustrations, or film, and many are accompanied by an original score performed live by Magik*Magik Orchestra. After each show, the performers and audience share drinks and conversation together in the venue or a nearby bar.  History  Pop-Up Magazine was founded in San Francisco in 2009 by Douglas McGray, Lauren Smith, Derek Fagerstrom, Evan Ratliff, and Maili Holiman. McGray says the idea for the show came from trying to get different kinds of storytellers and artists together in the same room. \\"Filmmakers have their film openings, and artists will have gallery openings, and writers will have their readings. And we're never at the same things together. We thought about the idea of a live magazine as a way to bring these different communities together and bring their communities of fans together.\\" The first Pop-Up Magazine show was at the 360-seat Brava Theater in San Francisco's Mission District in 2009. Its audience has nearly tripled every year since launching, growing from that 360-seat theater to a 900-seat auditorium in 2010 to a 2,600-member audience in 2011. In the fall of 2015, Pop-Up Magazine went on its first national tour with stops in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City. In spring of 2016, the show toured again, for a live audience of nearly 10,000 people, in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland. In 2018, Pop-Up Magazine was acquired by Emerson Collective.  Collaborations  Outside of its own tours, Pop-Up Magazine occasionally partners with organizations and public figures for special performances. In 2011, they collaborated with SFMOMA with a show about wine and ESPN the Magazine for a show about sports. In 2013, they produced a night of stories and live music inspired by Beck‚Äôs Song Reader, a collection of sheet music written by Beck and published by McSweeneys. And, in 2015 they curated Session 8 of TED2015 in Vancouver, producing a set of 11 stories performed on TED's main stage.  The California Sunday Magazine  Pop-Up Magazine is produced by California Sunday, Inc., which also publishes an online and print magazine called The California Sunday Magazine. McGray launched the magazine with publisher Chas Edwards in October 2014. In 2016, the magazine won the National Magazine Award for overall excellence in print magazine photography. Other finalists included National Geographic, New York, Vanity Fair, and Wall Street Journal. McGray said: ‚ÄúWe started a media company. We approached it like a story production company. Some of the things we‚Äôd make would be live experiences, live stories, and some of the things we‚Äôd make would be stories for you to read at home.‚Äù  Past contributors  * Larry Sultan, photographer * Daniel Alarc√≥n, novelist, journalist, and co- creator, Radio Ambulante * Susan Orlean, writer for The New Yorker * Beck, musician * Alice Walker, novelist * Jeff Bridges, actor * Michael Pollan, author * Marc Bamuthi Joseph, poet, playwright, dancer * Alexis Madrigal, editor in chief, Fusion * John C.

He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the first painters of the Papunya Tula school. Early life Freddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert ‚Äì most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping. At Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994. Painting West did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (Tingari), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide.

She makes acrylic paintings and traditional wood carvings, and is one of the most successful artists from the region. Her paintings have attracted critical acclaim for her unusually modern style. Ruby paints sacred stories from the Dreamtime that have morals or lessons from her people's traditional law. She uses the typical style of the Western Desert, but the techniques and imagery are more modern. Her style is said to be experimental. Ruby is a member of the Pitjantjatjara nation. She was born about 1940, at a sacred site near Kata Ala, Western Australia. She grew up with her family in the bushland along the western side of the border with South Australia. Her family spent most of their time travelling between her father's homeland near Pukara and her mother's around Mantamaru. When Ruby was a teenager, they followed other Pitjantjatjara families to settle at Ernabella, far to the east. Ruby grew up and went to school at the mission there until she got married. Ruby's husband was a stockman whose family came from what is now Ama·πØa, west of Ernabella. After they got married, they moved north to Areyonga, where he worked on the cattle station. They later moved back to his homeland, where he got a job on the Musgrave Park station. They had five children together, before her husband died in his early 40s. In 1999, the senior women of Ama·πØa, including Ruby, founded Minymaku Arts (it is now called Tjala Arts). Ruby began working there herself in 2000. Her first solo exhibitions were in Hobart in 2003 and 2005, and then in Melbourne in 2008. Her artwork has been shown alongside works by other Tjala artists in every major city in Australia. She has also had her work shown in group exhibitions in Singapore and the United States. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Queensland Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.

Its main concentration is on web-connected, photography-based products, including technologies for hashtag printing and geotag printing, and wall-mounted printers. Instaprint‚Äôs wall-mounted hashtag printers print Instagram photos in real time by using a specific hashtag at an event. Brands or companies rent the hashtag printers for large corporate or high profile events. When the events‚Äô guests use a branded hashtag at the event, the guests‚Äô Instagram pictures are printed from the box, and the guests can keep them as a souvenir. Instaprint products have been featured at over 1,000 events in 150 cities around the world. The printers have been rented for well-known events such as the Super Bowl, Olympics, the Grammys, NHL Winter Classic, Lollapalooza, US Open, AUS Open, Art Basel, NYSE, Festival de Canne, Comic-Con, SxSW, CES and New York Fashion Week.  History  In February, 2011, Instagram released a private beta of their API about a month after introducing hashtags on Instagram. Shortly thereafter, Instaprint founders, Andrew Zolty, Mattias Gunneras and Michael Lipton came up with the idea of turning Instagram photos into Polaroids (Polaroid had inspired the Instagram platform). Zolty, Gunneras and Lipton were all working at Breakfast, a company they had also founded that made digital products that produced real world experiences. With little to no funds, the team tried to get their Instaprint idea sponsored at SxSW Interactive. Two of the companies they reached out to were Instagram and Polaroid, but they did not end up sponsoring the product. With no sponsors, they decided to build the printers anyway to see if they could get PR at SxSW. Initially, they built three printers, testing the first in March 2011. Their first printers used a Zink printer engine, which meant they were ‚Äúink-free,‚Äù instead pulling color from the paper itself. Polaroid also uses Zink printer engines for its products. The first appearance of the Instaprint hashtag printers was on a live site launched on March 7, 2011. The site featured a live stream of two of the printers hung up in the office window of Breakfast. Any print hashtagged #instaprint would be printed live on the site. The week after the live site was launched, the Instaprint team brought the hashtag printers to SXSW. The hashtag printers generated a lot of excitement, and they were invited to multiple popular events at the festival. Felicia Day invited them over Twitter to the Driskell hotel. Here, the team set up the printers and met several celebrities excited by the product, including Instagram co- founder, Mike Kruger, who came out specifically to see the hashtag printers.  Extensions  Instaprint later developed more hashtag enabled products, the largest scale example being Instaprint Mosaics. Also featured at events, Mosaics are created by guests using a branded hashtag, and the Instagram photos are run through a complex algorithm, printed out and assigned to a specific place in a grid. When all the photos are printed and placed in the grid, they create a large-scale image, usually featuring the brand throwing the event. Mosaics launched with Ray-Ban at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona on May 29, 2012. Mosaics are patent-pending.  Kickstarter  In 2012, Instaprint put the product on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. It did not raise enough funds.

The Frates team consisted of players of the caliber Kiwane Garris, Alvin Young, Ray Tutt, Marcelo Dami√£o, the experience of Claudio Pol Bodetto, and talented young people like Marco Stain and Angelo Gigli. The red and white leadership can not but reaffirm the Milan coach for next season, 2004-05 disputandola in the top division. Frates for this season will be full of successes, starting especially from the confirmations of Garris (which will then be elected one of the best players in the league), Dami√£o, Stain and Gigli (season in which young talents of the white and the nursery will be noticeable from different teams league), the important grafts Paul McPherson, Sam Hines, Ken Lacey, the addition expert's point guard Stephen Attruia, and youth passed from the nursery to the first team as Giorgio Boscagin and Franco Best.

The one-time owner of the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site, Craigie developed much of East Cambridge, Massachusetts and was responsible for the construction of the Canal Bridge connecting East Cambridge and Boston, which later became known as the Craigie Bridge and later was rebuilt as the Charles River Dam Bridge, but which is still also referred to as Craigie's Bridge. Early life Born to Scottish ship captain Andrew Craigie and his Nantucket-born wife Elizabeth, Andrew Craigie Jr. attended the Boston Latin School before being appointed by the Committee of Safety of the Province of Massachusetts on 30 April 1775 to take care of its medical stores. He was listed in a manuscript of \\"Medical Men in the American Revolution\\" deposited in the Library of Congress by Dr. J. M. Toner, who gave him the title of \\"Surg. Gen. Hosp.\\" The Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay referred to Craigie as the \\"commissary of medicinal stores\\" and charged him with providing beds, linen, and other supplies necessary for patient care to the troops gathering around Boston. He is believed to have attended the wounded at Bunker Hill two months after his appointment. Apothecary On 27 July 1775, the Continental Congress created \\"an hospital\\" (the forerunner of the U.S. Army's medical department) for its army of 20,000 soldiers. An apothecary was among the personnel specified in the resolution, and in time Craigie assumed that duty. His legacy in defining what ultimately became the roles of U.S. Army Medical Service Corps pharmacists and medical logistics officers is commemorated by the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, which recognizes a federal government pharmacist each year with the Andrew Craigie Award. After his work treating the wounded at Bunker Hill and building his practice at the hospital, he was recommended by Dr. John Morgan, director-general and chief surgeon of the army hospital, to become one of several Apothecaries General in 1777, responsible for the northern district. A subsequent reorganization of the military medical department in 1780 concentrated the authority for operations in all four districts in one medical staff. The title of \\"Apothecary\\" or \\"Apothecary General\\" was conveyed on Craigie at that time, and he became America's first official Apothecary General. Although he never met General George Washington, he came to Gen. Washington's attention, who mentioned Craigie in a letter written to \\"an influential member of Congress.\\" After he became the first apothecary general in the colonial army in 1777, Craigie recommended the creation of a central supply for medications. This supply facility was established in Lititz, Pennsylvania in 1778, and Craigie was stationed there for a period. During his time in Pennsylvania, Craigie met and fathered a child, Mary (\\"Polly\\") Allen, with a Philadelphia Quaker woman whose family forbade her to marry Craigie, a non-Quaker. Craigie evidently supported Allen without aid from the mother‚Äôs family, although Allen never lived in his household. Allen is known to have lived as a girl with the family of Joel Barlow, the poet and diplomat, and a friend of Craigie. Another friend of Craigie, Mrs. David Jackson of Philadelphia, told Allen about her parents‚Äô relationship after both had died. Post-war Period During and immediately after his time with the army, Craigie sold drugs and medicines wholesale with a partner in New York City. He also became a financier and land speculator, buying and selling parcels of property in New England and Ohio, amassing a large fortune in the process. Craigie was mustered out of the army in 1783. It is during this early post-war period that he became acquainted with then-Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton through his relationships with New York financial promoter William Duer (Continental Congressman) and speculator Daniel Parker. Parker played the lead role in organizing a business concern to purchase the post-war debt due to France from the United States in 1788. The men in Hamilton‚Äôs circle had insider knowledge of his plan for the new federal government to assume the war debts of the states, thereby making state debt certificates a better bet. Craigie bought up large amounts of discounted South Carolina paper at a good profit. By 1789, he had given up the wholesale pharmacy business he had started during the war, but continued to invest in real estate. He held substantial tracts in upstate New York, Oxford, Maine, and in East Cambridge, and speculated in both domestic and foreign money markets. Cambridge Socialite and Developer In 1791 or 1792 (accounts vary), Craigie purchased the Vassall House and farm, comprising approximately 150 acres, which had served as Washington‚Äôs headquarters during the war. The house came to be known as the ‚ÄúCraigie Mansion,‚Äù and later through its most famous tenant as the \\"Longfellow House,\\" and which today is known as the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site. The house served as a social center of Cambridge. Craigie installed gardens, a greenhouse and an icehouse, and held numerous parties and dances at what was described as his \\"princely bachelor‚Äôs establishment.\\" On January 10, 1793, Andrew Craigie was married to Elizabeth (‚ÄúBetsy‚Äù) Nancy Shaw. The parties continues, with guests that included Queen Victoria‚Äôs father and the French diplomat Talleyrand, among many others. His biographer described Craigie as someone who \\"entertained without regard to expense, who kept dozens of servants and well stocked stables and wine cellars.\\" Meanwhile, Craigie continued to invest in land speculation, much of it in East Cambridge. He secretly acquired 300 acres around Lechmere Point with several partners, and revived plans to construct a bridge from Lechmere Point to Boston, using the success of the Charlestown and West Boston Bridges as ammunition for their plans. On October 27, 1807, Craigie and twelve associates were given the authority to build the Canal Bridge. It was called \\"Canal Bridge\\" because one-third of the shares were to be held by the individual proprietors of the Middlesex Canal Corporation, but it soon came to be familiarly called \\"Craigie's Bridge.\\" The original bridge was completed and opened for travel in August, 1809. The original toll bridge became toll-free in 1858 and was replaced by the current Charles River Dam Bridge in 1910. The new bridge, situated next to the Museum of Science, is still referred to as Craigie's Bridge by many. As the area now known as Lechmere Square in East Cambridge grew, Craigie was able to exert significant influence over the areas development. The construction of the bridge prompted the laying out of roads to the center of Cambridge (now Cambridge Street, running to Harvard Square) and Somerville/Medford (Bridge Street, now Monsignor O'Brien Highway/Massachusetts Route 28). Craigie and his associates, who formed the Lechemere Point Corporation, benefited from the building boom that followed, spurred on by their efforts to expand the public street grid. Their rerouting of roads to steer traffic toward what was originally a toll bridge, however, was criticized by some at the time. Craigie was also fundamental in convincing Middlesex County authorities to move the Middlesex County Courthouse (Massachusetts) from Harvard Square to a new Charles Bulfinch-designed building in East Cambridge. Later Years As time went on, however, Craigie become involved in debt, fueled at least in part by his work to restore the house and by the extravagant social events held at his estate, and eventually secluded himself in his house for fear of arrest for debt collection. After his sudden death from a stroke in 1819, the Craigie estate was divided between his nephews and nieces, and Elizabeth Craigie received the house and the land immediately surrounding it. His wife became so financially burdened that she sold many effects of the mansion, and began to take in boarders. Short-term residents of the home included Washington biographer Jared Sparks, politician and future Massachusetts Governor Edward Everett, and lexicographer Joseph Emerson Worcester. Elizabeth Craigie died on May 5, 1841. One of her more famous longer-term boarders, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, bought the house after her death.

Metascape provides automated meta-analysis tools to understand either common or unique pathways and protein networks within a group of orthogonal target-discovery studies. History In the \\"OMICs\\" age, it is important to gain biological insights into a list of genes. Although a number of bioinformatics sources exist for this purpose, such as DAVID, they are not all free, easy to use, and well maintained. To analyze multiple lists of genes originated from orthogonal but complementary \\"OMICs\\" studies, tools often require computational skills that are beyond the reach of many biologists. According to the Metascape bloghttp://metascape.org/blog/?p=78, a team of scientists self-organized to address this challenge. The team includes core members Yingyao Zhou, Bin Zhou, Lars Pache, Max Chang, Christopher Benner, and Sumit Chanda, as well as other contributors over the time. Metascape was first released as a beta version on Oct 8, 2015. The first Metascape application was published on Dec 9, 2015. Metascape has gone through multiple releases since then. It currently supports key model organisms, pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network and component analysis, automatic presentation of the results as publication-ready web report, Excel and PowerPoint presentations. The paper titled \\"Metascape provides a biologist-oriented resource for the analysis of systems-level datasets\\" was published on Apr 3, 2019 in Nature Communications. Analysis workflow Metascape implements a CAME analysis workflow: * Conversion: Convert gene identifiers from popular types (such as Symbol, RefSeq, Ensembl, UniProt, UCSC) into human Entrez gene IDs and vice versa. * Annotation: Extract from dozens of function-relevant gene annotations, including protein families, transmembrane/secreted predictions, disease associations, compound associations, etc. * Membership: Flag gene memberships based on a custom keyword search within selected ontologies, e.g., highlight known \\"invasion\\" genes. * Enrichment: Identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, KEGG, Reactome, BioCarta, as well as other pathways and data sets collected in MSigDB, etc. In addition, enriched ontology terms are automatically clustered to reduce redundancy for easier interpretation. Protein-protein interaction networks are constructed based on BioGRID, OmniPath, InWeb_IM and dense components are identified and biologically interpreted. Metascape integrated over 40 bioinformatics knowledgebase into a seamless user interface, where experimental biologists can use a single-click Express Analysis feature to turn multiple gene lists into interpretable results. Analysis report All analysis results are presented in a web report, which contains Excel annotation and enrichment sheets, PowerPoint slides, and custom analysis files (e.g., .cys file by Cytoscape, .svg by Circos) for further offline analysis or processing. One noticeable strength of Metascape is its visualization capability. Metascape has aided in the interpretation of 1,300 published studies as of October 2020 http://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/citations/, among which 2/3 of publications made use of graphs or sheets prepared by Metascape.

History During the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula, the territory of Mirandela was intensely populated; owing to its fertile, arable land it was an important agricultural centre. In the Tr√°s-os-Montes region, Mirandela has always occupied a central place within the territory. In 1198, one of the first references to the settlement occurred with the stay of King D. Sancho I when Bragan√ßa was under siege by troops loyal to King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. King D. Afonso III conceded a foral to Mirandela in 1250. It is likely that the construction of the castle and wall fortifications were begun at this time, in order to protect the population. The 1258 Inquiries suggest that the settlement had existed since the reign of King Afonso II. In 1282, the primitive settlement of Mirandela was transferred from the locale of Castelo Velho to the elevated hilltop of Cabe√ßao de S√£o Miguel by regal charter. During the sequence of this event, the monarch also issued orders to erect a citadel and keep tower. At the time of its completion it was considered, for the epoch, one of the better fortifications in the Tr√°s-os- Montes region. On 7 March 1291, King D. Dinis conceded a new foral and defined the limites of the municipal territory of Mirandela. Construction of the tower and walls along the hilltop of S√£o Miguel continued. Within the walls, the first fair occurred in 1295. On 27 June 1301, a letter of donation was issued for the town of Mirandela to Branca Louren√ßo. A notice was issued in 1318, regarding the position of the citadel at Mirandela by the King to Domingos Geraldes, in virtue of the state of abandon, which was designated as the Paa√ßo del Rey (the Palace of the King). The castle was mentioned between 1383 and 1385, in the Chronicle of D. Jo√£o I by Fern√£o Lopes, who indicated Mirandela's support of the pretensions of the Master of Avis. During this time and extending to 1448, Mirandela was one of the medieval castles that suffered several interventions to conserve and reinforce the structure.Jo√£o Gouveia Monteiro (1999), p. 152 Notice in 1401 indicated that public works were being undertaken on the walls and dungeons through the initiative of the Crown, owing to the war. King D. Manuel I conceded a new foral to Mirandela, in Lisbon on 1 July 1512. But, quickly, by 1530, the castle lost its military importance, which started its gradual decline and ruin of the castle. As a public census indicated that year: \\"The town of Mirandela is encircled by parts in ruin\\".Ernesto Sales (1978), p.49 A 1688 municipal document mentioned the Postigo de S√£o Jos√© that existed in one of the walls of the castle. Father Carvalho da Costa, writing in 1706: the town \\"is walled for old use with feeble wall with parts in ruin and three doors\\". Another contemporary at the time, J. Alvarez Colmenar referred to Mirandela as being situated on the margins of the Tuela River and defended by a castle in 1715. With loss of its strategic/defensive role and growth in economic development, many builders looked to the unused walls as potential building material. From the 19th century on, the castle became a source of stone, helping to pave new streets and building houses. The walls of the castle were lowered by half a meter, in order to support the repaving of the city streets. Between 1874 and 1884, various parts of the walls were knocked down in order to construct buildings in the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, two of the four gates still remained at the castle: one of the gates was destroyed intentionally by the municipality. This occurred even as in May 1950, the municipal authority placed a plaque on the interior arch, commemorating the 700 years since Mirandela's elevation to the status of town. The remains of the medieval wall, represented by the Santo Ant√≥nio Gate, was classified as a Property of Public Interest by decree published on 20 October 1955. By the 1970s notices describe the castle of Mirandela as in ruin. Yet, in May 2000, another plaque was erected to mark the 750 anniversary of the towns elevation. Architecture The urban castle is surrounded by residence, especially in the lower quarter, situated along an arterial near the Tua River and bridge, and the Rua da Republica. Most of the buildings that surround the remains of the old castle are three floors high. Of the remaining links to the castle's history, is the Santo Ant√≥nio Gate, formed from two thick walls, separated by a rounded arch, broken on the exterior and rounded on the interior side. The gate is approximately high, with the still visible the grooves in the granite stones for the hinges used in opening and closing the access. Over the gate are vestiges of the primitive Chemin de ronde walkway, which was later transformed into a terrace for the residences. There are other wall segments throughout the city, some high and thick, built with a base of granite and shale throughout.

Founded by Hans Stier in 2013, the company first received widespread notice for its highly successful crowdfunding (the company is entirely crowdfunded). Despite significant controversy over its fund raising strategy and lack of communication with crowdfunding contributors, the product received recognition for its combination of coffee and Internet of Things technology, including a Dealerscope 2018 IMPACT Award  History  Hans Stier founded his first attempt at a roast-grind-brew concept, Kaffee Toro, in 2010. This version of the concept was based solely on providing consumers with green beans and a machine that could turn them into black coffee, without any connection between growers and consumers. After Kaffee Toro closed, Stier and a few members of the Kaffee Toro team refined the concept, this time opting to crowdfund the project. Stier also decided to crowd-source the initial design of the machine on Jovoto. The company's 2013 Kickstarter campaign garnered wide notice for rapidly surpassing its $135,000 goal, with over 2,200 contributing to raise more than $680,000. An Indiegogo campaign followed, with over 430 backers helping to raise close to $125,000. In August 2014, the company ran a third campaign, this time on Seedmatch, raising over ‚Ç¨1.5mn, officially overfunding by more than 750%. The 2013 crowdfunding campaigns projected an October 2014 delivery date. Multiple development difficulties led the company to postpone their launch for two years, debuting the finished project at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2016.> In September 2017, Bonaverde closed their fourth crowdfunding campaign, launched that summer on equity crowdfunding platform Seedrs. The campaign met its ¬£750,000 goal within two hours of launching, and went on to raise more than ¬£1.3 million[A]. Bonaverde began its first shipments to its original crowdfunding backers during the campaign , and completed delivery of machines to all crowdfunding backers in the United States and European Union by early 2018. Machines became available for general sale in late 2017. Bonaverde AG is a limited liability stock issuing company that is not yet publicly traded. Stier remains Managing Director, while the supervisory board is run by well-known German serial entrepreneur Michael Brehm. Brehm has funded and sold companies to Google, eBay, Amazon and Facebook. Adjunct to Brehm is Dr. Jens Odewald, former CEO of the world's largest retail and electronics conglomerate METRO AG (former Kaufhaus AG) and former head of the supervisory board to Tchibo, Germany's number one coffee player and the world's sixth largest coffee house chain. Mark Hartmann, Venture Partner at Project A Ventures, oversees the board. After the Seedrs equity crowdfunding, Seedrs also became an investor as a nominee representing the individual contributors.  Machine  The first version of Bonaverde's roast-grind-brew coffee machine, named Dalia, featured a crowdsourced, curved wood design and a dial with ten roasting profiles. After the crowdfunding campaign, difficulties over the course of the machine's two-year development led to a series of changes, resulting in a rectangular, white machine designed by Berlin-based designer Daniel von Waldthausen launched in January 2016. Coffee beans are placed in the top of the machine for roasting, after which they drop into a steel cone grinder and are brewed using a rainshower brewing method. The newest version of the machine, renamed Berlin, also features Internet of Things technology connecting it to the company's cloud-based coffee marketplace. Each machine contains an RFID-reader and SIM card, enabling it to identify RFID-tagged green coffee beans, connect to the company's Coffee Cloud, and Coffee Concierge Facebook messenger app. The machine roasts green beans in 50g batches, making up to 1.2L of coffee per batch. Other features include a roaster that heats to over 600 degrees (F) and a stainless steel cone grinder.  Coffee-Tech Interaction  Bonaverde is focused on employing technology to create ‚Äúfarmer-centric coffee.‚Äù Green coffee beans sold by the company come with RFID tags programmed with a roast profile tailored for the coffee. Bonaverde users scan the RFID tags into a panel on the front of the machine to tell the machine the correct roasting parameters for a given bean. The concept aims to remove middlemen, putting the focus on the coffee farmer. The company has also created the Bonaverde Coffee Concierge, a Facebook messenger-based digital product designed to enable deeper interaction between customers and their coffee. The Coffee Concierge's features include roast profile customization and information about the farmers who grow specific coffees, the ability to schedule a roast in advance, and other features. Bonaverde offers a growing selection of beans for purchase in the United States and European Union. Users can also purchase green beans elsewhere and roast them using special one-size-fits-all profile tags or the Coffee Concierge.  Recognition  Bonaverde's merging of tech and coffee has reached garnered wide recognition across multiple industries. In 2018, they received a Dealearscope IMPACT award for the Bonaverde Berlin. The company was also a finalist for a Product Innovation Award at the Coffee Shop Innovation Expo in 2017..The Berlin has also been highlighted by the press, who have ranked it among the 15 Best Coffeemakers on the Planet, the Top 10 Coolest Gadgets at CES 2016, and the Coolest Green Tech of 2016.  Controversy  Bonaverde has received some criticism from crowdfunding backers, both due to the delayed delivery and changes in the original design. Much of the controversy stems from accusations that the company is using RFID tags to turn the machine and marketplace into a proprietary system, a criticism assuaged with the launch of the Coffee Concierge, which allows customers to roast beans from any source. Bonaverde responded to demands for refunds in 2014 by offering full refunds once the company reaches profitability. Bonaverde has furthered the controversy by refusing refunds to many of their backers well after the request was made. Bonaverde claimed that a refund won't be made due to the use of an arbitrary date conveniently prior to the supposed request date and prior to the instructions being sent in their most recent version of 'how to request a refund'. Those backers requesting refunds are the same backers that have not received the promised machine.  Company Insolvency  On 22-October, 2019, Hans Stier, the Bonaverde Managing Director, send backers an email stating: \\"Before an official public release I‚Äôm writing to you personally with the difficult news that after all the challenges, milestones, re-inventions and the constant getting-back-up mentality, Bonaverde has at last had to file for voluntary insolvency under the German Insolvency Act. Me and the whole team, we‚Äôre deeply sorry for the struggles faced in achieving our mission, our inability in fulfilling our pledge to you and the community, and the feeling of falling down right before the finish line. We know how frustrating this news is. A lack of new funding for a hardware company, the constant strain of working capital and, in the end, an unexpected hardware recall from the manufacturer of the most recent generation of Berlin coffee roaster has hit hard financially, making it impossible for us to continue operations. The worst thing for us personally is that we feel we still have an incredible wealth of untapped assets that haven‚Äôt yet realised their full potential. Starting with signed and alive global distribution licensing deals, IoT devices, digital products, hardware patents and IP and most of all, the exciting prospect of our just-released Urban Coffee Club. Our lack of immediate liquidity has tied our hands, as it prevents us from continuing our operations satisfactorily, despite its exciting opportunity. But we don‚Äôt want to give up and we will try everything in our power to get through this somehow, and to find a way of continuing our mission to change coffee. We are humbled to have had you as part of our community ‚Äî for that, your support, and your patience over the years, we can‚Äôt thank you enough. That is also why we are not only struggling through this for our own team, but also for the sake of all the backers and supporters that believed in us. If (and that really is an \\"IF\\") we should find a way to continue through some way of restructuring or \\"rebirth\\", then we plan to take all the existing crowdfunding shareholders along with an equivalent share value, or to find a way of keeping them part of the journey despite the fact that the original Bonaverde company would be dissolved. But that \\"if\\" at the moment still has a big question mark. And this is where we at least want to give everyone the chance, to add support or ideas on how we could continue the journey. The worst that could happen is us informing you of the end of Bonaverde and you feeling like \\"why didn‚Äôt they ask for help?\\" So if you did want to support with any solutions, introductions, on an actual plan for the restructuring, if you still see potential, if you still believe and if you don't want this to be over just yet - then your chance is now\\" Backers are encouraged to reach out to Mr. Stier through a web-based survey tool and volunteer to offer \\"help\\" to support the company's continuation. It appears that Bonaverde suffered some operational or financial misadventure, and this may be related to the recall of production units which were manufactured with a non-standard component and presented users with an \\"overheating risk\\" of the roasting unit.

Herescu (December 5, 1906 ‚Äì August 19, 1961) was a Romanian classical scholar, essayist, translator and poet. Descended from a noble family of Oltenia, he was trained in Latin and became a full professor at the University of Bucharest while still in his twenties. He translated widely from the Roman canon, as well as publishing a series of studies devoted to ancient writers. Meanwhile, Herescu wrote poetry of his own, and was president of the Romanian Writers' Society for several years. He left his native country shortly before a Soviet occupation began, and spent the last part of his life in exile, first in Portugal and then in France. Biography =Origins and early career= Born in Turnu Severin, his parents were Lieutenant Colonel Ion Herescu (later a General) and his wife Caterina (n√©e Vii»ôoreanu). His mother came from a landed Oltenian boyar family, and he was named after his maternal uncle, a judge. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"√énrudirile unui clasicist: N.I. Herescu\\", Ziarul Financiar, October 27, 2006 He attended high school in Craiova, followed by the classical languages section of the literature and philosophy faculty at Bucharest University. He attended specialty courses in Paris from 1927 to 1929, and obtained a Doctor of Letters degree in 1929. He taught Latin language and literature at Bucharest, as a teaching assistant (1929), associate professor (1932) and full professor (1935‚Äì1945). He was director of Bucharest's Institute of Latin Studies. Politically, he was affiliated with the Alexandru Averescu-led People's Party,Boia, p. 102 in 1939 joining the leadership of the National Renaissance Front, the sole party under the royal dictatorship of King Carol II.Boia, p. 134 Herescu thrived under the dictatorship: in 1939, upon the death of Nicolae M. Condiescu, he was elected president of the Romanian Writers' Society,Boia, p. 156-57 and would serve until 1944. Soon after, Carol offered him Condiescu's other post, that of secretary general of the Carol I Academic Foundation. (Presumably, Alexandru Rosetti, himself involved with the Foundation, coveted the position, and his correspondence on the topic with George CƒÉlinescu was laced with hostility and irony. When the latter remarked that Herescu \\"is no writer, is nothing\\", Rosetti replied \\"ex nihilo-nihil\\", a reference to the classicist's initials NIH.) To the end, he remained a regime supporter, sending the king a report on the Foundation's activities in July 1940, less than two months before Carol's abdication. There, he opined that the classical and Latin aspects of Romanian culture should be emphasized, in order to spur a renaissance. In an attack on Rosetti's editorial policy, he complained that important writers were being sidelined while \\"young men condemned by the courts and by the unanimity of critics for pornography are easily published\\", a reference to Geo Bogza. He also deemed Eugen Lovinescu's translations of the Odyssey and Aeneid as \\"execrable\\". When the National Legionary State came to power that autumn and examined whether university professors should be retained, the resulting report found fault with his meager scientific activity and affiliation with the previous regime. He was nevertheless kept on the faculty, with the condition that his research output demonstrate commitment to the new order during the next two years.Boia, p. 181 He was a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, as well as of the Parisian Soci√©t√© des √âtudes Latines.

His first stop, in Nazi Germany, was at the bombed-out Stuttgart Airport, where all his luggage, including manuscripts and money, caught fire. Herescu then reached Lisbon, where he was hosted by Mircea Eliade. Unable to support himself, he intended to return home during the next few months. He repeatedly asked the university authorities and the Education Ministry to prolong his leave of absence, transfer his salary or give him an official duty. However, his name appeared on the first list of those excluded from the university in January 1945, and his letter that August, refuting accusations of pro-German sentiment point by point, was ignored. Meanwhile, its recent president, he had been expelled from the Writers' Society in September 1944.Boia, p. 264 He taught at the University of Lisbon from 1947 to 1948, but his contract was not renewed.Boia, pp. 251‚Äì52 Subsequently, moving to Paris, Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Despre N.I. Herescu\\" , Romania LiterarƒÉ, nr. 46/2008 he worked at the Romanian section of French Radio. He continued to publish in his field, but was unable to relaunch a university career. Inside Romania, his work was suppressed by the Communist regime due to his hostile attitude toward it, and only began to see republication after the 1989 Revolution. Herescu's first published poem, \\"Sonet\\", appeared in the Craiova magazine NƒÉzuin»õa in 1922. His translations of Aeschylus, Catullus, Horace, Plautus, Tibullus and Virgil have been described as among the finest in Romanian. In his studies and essays, he took care to render classical values accessible to a wide public (Pentru clasicism, 1937; Caete clasice, 1941; Milliarium, vol. I-II, 1936‚Äì1941) or to make erudite contributions in the field of ancient literature (especially those published abroad: Catullo, 1943; Punti di vista sulla lingua di Tito-Livio, 1943; Ovidiana, 1958, in collaboration; La po√©sie latine, 1960; Style et hasard, 1963). His bibliographic works are of fundamental importance: Bibliographie de la litt√©rature latine (1943), Bibliografia clasicƒÉ √Æn Rom√¢nia (in collaboration, 1943). Together with Pillat, he translated Poezii alese din Francis Jammes (1927). His original poems were generally rustic idylls in the Horatian manner that resembled Pillat's style: Basmul celor patru zodii (1926), Cartea cu luminƒÉ (1926). In 1961, under the pen name Charles S√©verin (a reference to his birthplace), he published L'agonie sans mort, a French-language roman √† clef dealing with the exile experience. Its author's identity soon pinpointed by Virgil Ierunca, the book appeared in Romanian in 1998, as Agonie fƒÉrƒÉ moarte.

Six meditation instructions, or guidelines, form the core of the practice.  Rationale  Engaging in mindful dialogue with one or more other people supported by instruction in the guidelines and by contemplations that encourage a direct and intimate inquiry into the human experience is the form of the practice. Insight dialogue is taught and practiced in a number of contexts‚Äîresidential retreats, daylong workshops, community practice groups, and online (e.g., via Skype). Insight dialogue has its roots in the Buddha's early teachings on the human experience (PƒÅli Canon) and the practice of Insight or VipassanƒÅ meditation; however, people of all faiths and backgrounds can practice. Gregory Kramer and Terri O'Fallon co- created insight dialogue. Gregory Kramer, the Founder and Guiding Teacher of Metta Programs, continued developing the practice and has been teaching it worldwide since 1995.  Guidelines  Although designed to work together, the insight dialogue guidelines are typically taught individually, in sequence. = Pause = Temporal pause; stepping out of habitual thoughts and reactions into experience in the present moment; mindfulness. = Relax = Invitation to calm the body and mind; receiving whatever sensations, thoughts, and feelings are present; acceptance. = Open = Extension of mindfulness from internal to include the external; spaciousness; matures to include the relational moment; mutuality. = Attune to emergence = Entering the relational moment without an agenda; awareness of the impermanence of thoughts and feelings; allowing experience to unfold; \\"don't know\\" mind. This guideline was originally termed \\"Trust emergence\\".In a January 2019 blog post, Gregory Kramer suggested the new wording \\"Attune to emergence\\": = Listen deeply = Listening mindfully, with an awareness that is relaxed and open; ripens into unhindered receptivity to the unfolding words, emotions, and presence of another. = Speak the truth = Articulation of the truth of one's subjective experience with mindfulness; discernment of what to say amid the universe of possibilities; ripens into an acute sensitivity to the voice of the moment that \\"speaks through\\" the meditator.

History In 1891, seven clergymen, including Thomas Morris of Pontyglasier, were charged with beating a bailiff attempting to recover tithe arrears. They were remanded on bail of ¬£40 each. They appeared before magistrates a month later, in which the Reverend Morris was accused of knocking the bailiff‚Äôs hat off three times during a scuffle.

The unit traces its origin to the World War II Royal Hungarian 1st vit√©z Bertalan √Årp√°d Parachute Battalion, which fought against the Soviet Red Army. In 1945 the remaining elements of the regiment were disbanded. In 1951, as part of the Hungarian People's Army, a new Parachute Battalion was created in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. This unit was disbanded after the 1953 military forces reduction. After the events of the 1956 revolution a stabilization process began. In 1957 a special purpose reconnaissance company was created. The company was enlarged to battalion level in 1962 and it was allocated to the Chief of Staffs 2nd Directorate. The 27th Separate Reconnaissance Company was detached from the battalion, forming a sub unit of the 5th Combined Arms Army stationed in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The unit served as the eyes-and ears of the Army for decades. It had during this time three special purpose long range recon companies. In 1977 the 27th Separate Reconnaissance Company was again part of the battalion, and the battalion became the 5th Army's reconnaissance unit. In 1990 the 34th Special Reconnaissance Battalion took on the name of L√°szl√≥ Bercs√©nyi son of General Mikl√≥s Bercs√©nyi. Shoulder Sleeve Insignia of the 34th Bercs√©nyi L√°szl√≥ Reconnaissance Battalion In 2001 the unit moved from its garrison to its present location at Szolnok Air Base.

It was once the grounds of Muiravonside House and the country estate owned by the Stirling family of Falkirk. Description The park forms part of the River Avon Heritage Trail past the historic Avon Aqueduct and relics of industry and farming, including a Lime Kiln, hydro-powered sawmill and restored listed 17th-century doocot. The old Home Farm now forms the visitor centre, which is closed for renewal. The Newparks Farm has been transformed into an animal attraction with many breeds of animals and birds. Over 90 species of bird have been recorded at the park. In 2016, a Heritage Lottery grant and money from a nearby landfill site allowed the park to expand and improve its trails, with the introduction of seven specially commissioned sculptures.Great Outdoors comes to life at Muiravonside, Falkirk Herald, Retrieved February 2016 History Reginald Prat de Tindale gave the estate to his daughter, Margaretta, upon her marriage to Richard de Miville in 1189. The hub of the estate was the, now ruined, Anglo-Norman 'Maiden Castle' located just outside the country park. Around this time the land is referred to as \\"Murgunessete\\" or 'the abode of Morgan'. In 1471, the estate came into the Ross family by marriage.Sir John Ross fell at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, who was heir to the estate. the estate stayed in the Ross family, during which time the first Muiravonside House was built in 1609. This was extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. =McLeods= Muiravonside House In 1724, the estate was sold to John MacLeod, an Edinburgh advocate. This family had a long history of supporting the return of the Stuarts to the throne, Alexander McLeod, who stayed at Muiravonside, was one of Bonnie Prince Charlie's aide de camp.Muiravonside House‚Äôs military history, Scott McAngus, 31 March 2014, Falkirk Herald, Retrieved 13 February 2016 Leading up to the Jacobite rising of 1745 these Jacobite sympathisers were amongst those plotting the return of the Stuarts. Also involved was a leading Scottish advocate and friend of the Macleods, Lord Grange, whose wife, Rachel Chiesley, threatened to expose his Jacobite sympathies and his plot for the crown. After being abducted on 22 January 1732, she was held at Muiravonside house temporarily,Rev. Dr. Donald MacKinnon and Alick Morrison, The MacLeods The Genealogy of a Clan, Section II, Edinburgh, The Clan MacLeod Society, 1968, pp. 32-34 before being incarcerated in various remote locations on the western isles of Scotland, including the Monarch Isles, Skye and the Hirta, an island of St Kilda. =Stirlings= Charles Stirling died at Muiravonside in 1867 In 1835, the estate was sold to Charles Stirling whose sixteen children included General Sir William Stirling K.C.B. This was a time of agricultural improvement in Scotland and Sir Charles Stirling aimed to make the estate as self-sufficient as possible. He built the lime kilns, that can still be seen on the estate, and his own clay drain works. He turned an old grain mill into a sawmill and oversaw the Muiravonside Coalfield, which had been operating since the 18th century. Charles was not the first to marry his cousin and Charles married Charlotte Dorothea Stirling who was the daughter of the late Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Stirling in 1835. They had four sons and three daughters. When Charles died in 1867 at Muiravonside, the estate went to his eldest son Andrew who was a lawyer. During World War I, 11 British soldiers were billeted in the house, which was, by then, partially let out. Thomas Willing Stirling, last of the Stirlings to be buried in the family burial ground on the estate died in 1930, the estate went to his eldest son Sir Arthur Charles Stirling, who remained there until his death on 21 February 1967. It was his intention, having no male heir, the estate should go to his sister. However Stirling's cousin, Sir Norman Charles Stirling objected on the grounds of entail, which resulted in long and protracted court proceedings. Ten years later the case, Stirling TRS vs Stirling, was settled in favour of Sir Arthur Charles will, by then the house was ruined. A considerable amount of money would be needed to make the estate again viable. The new owner being of considerable age and with no intimate concern for the estate, sold part of the estate to what was then Falkirk District Council in 1977. The once grand house was deemed unsafe and it was demolished as part of the estate's restoration as Falkirk's first country park in the 1970s. In 1980, the Countryside Ranger Service began its mission to educate and to provide information as well as to maintain the park's woodland and its walks. This has included helping with the installation of sculptures around the park. The sculptures are funded by the operators of a local landfill site.Great Outdoors comes to life at Muiravonside, Scott McAngus, 7 February 2016, Falkirk Herald, Retrieved 8 March 2016  References   External links  * Muiravonside web site Category:Country parks in Scotland Category:Parks in Falkirk (council area) ","title":"Muiravonside Country Park"},{"id":"49399285","text":"In medicine, vascular access is a means of accessing the bloodstream through the peripheral or central blood vessels in order to obtain blood or deliver medications including chemotherapy. A vascular access procedure involves insertion of a sterile plastic tube called a catheter into a blood vessel. Types of catheters can be either peripherally or centrally located. Peripheral catheters are approximately one inch long and are inserted into the small veins of the forearm. Central catheters are bigger and longer and are inserted into the large veins of the extremities, neck, or chest. Central venous catheters is the primary modality used for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. The duration of central venous catheterization is dependent on the type of treatment given.  Central venous catheters  Central venous catheters (CVC) are catheters inserted into the large veins of the arm, neck, chest, or groin. CVC's are used for delivery of medications, nutrients, or blood products for a longer periods, usually weeks to months. There are several reasons for the use of central venous access: * To get more than one drug at a time * To get continuous infusion chemo (over 24 hours or longer) * To get nutrition * To get frequent treatments * To get treatments at home * To get long-term therapy (over many months or even longer) * To get drugs that can cause serious damage to skin and muscle tissue if they leak outside a vein (these drugs are known as vesicants). Getting them through a CVC rather than in a short-term IV reduces the risk that the drug will leak and damage tissues. Types of CVCs include peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters, and implanted ports. =Peripherally-inserted central catheters= Peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICC, pronounced \\"pick\\"), is a form of vascular access that is inserted at a peripheral site such as the veins of the arms and extends in the central venous system at the superior vena cava. The catheters in inserted into the veins in the arm such as the cephalic, basilic, or brachial veins and then advanced towards the heart. The line can then be used for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. Removal of a PICC is a relatively simple procedure that can be accomplished by a trained nurse even in the outpatient setting. The area is bandaged and allowed to heal. =Tunneled catheters= A tunneled catheter is a catheter (a thin tube) that is placed in a vein for long-term use. It is most commonly placed in the neck (internal jugular) but may also be placed in the groin (femoral), liver (transhepatic), chest (subclavian) or back (translumbar). The catheter is inserted into the vessel under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance and tunneled through the skin. Tunneled catheters have multiple channels called lumens which lay exposed on the surface of the skin. These lumens are the access points when the catheter is used. Tunneled catheters can be single, double, or triple lumened. Removal of a tunneled catheter is a simple procedure requiring only local anesthetic. A bandage is applied to the site to heal. =Implanted port= A port is similar to a tunneled catheter but is left entirely under the skin. Medicines are injected through the skin into the catheter. Some implanted ports contain a small reservoir that can be refilled in the same way. After being filled, the reservoir slowly releases the medicine into the bloodstream. An implanted port is less obvious than a tunneled catheter and requires little daily care. It has less impact on a person's activities than a PICC line or a tunneled catheter. Surgically implanted infusion ports are placed below the clavicle (infraclavicular fossa), with the catheter threaded into the heart (right atrium) through a large vein. Once implanted, the port is accessed via noncoring \\"Huber\\" needles inserted through the skin. The health care provider may need to use topical anesthetic before accessing the port. Ports can be used for medications, chemotherapy, and blood. As ports are located completely under the skin, they are easier to maintain and have a lower risk of infection than CVC or PICC catheters. Ports are typically used on patients requiring only occasional venous access over a long duration course of therapy. Since the port must be accessed using a needle, if venous access is required on a frequent basis a catheter having external access is more commonly used  Central venous catheter complications  Complications associated with central venous catheters include infection, pneumothorax, thrombosis, misplacement, and bleeding. =Pneumothorax= Penumothorax can occur during insertion of the catheter. The use of ultrasound guidance aids in mitigating the risk of pneumothorax by ensuring proper placement through direct visualization. =Infection= Catheters can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream which can lead to local infection and possibly sepsis. Risk of infection is mitigated during insertion through use of sterile technique and proper catheter care after insertion which includes keeping the area of the catheter clean, washing of hands prior to use, and application of clean dressings. In the event of a central line infection, the line is removed and appropriate antimicrobial agents are given according to the type of infectious organism and severity of clinical condition. =Bleeding= Since catheters are placed within blood vessels there is always a risk of bleeding during placement and while the catheter is in place. Bleeding can range from localized hematoma (bruise) to hemorrhage (profuse bleeding). =Thrombosis= The use of central venous catheters is a risk factor for the formation of blood clots in the upper extremity. The etiology is thought to be due to activation of the clotting cascade by trauma to the vein during placement as well as the presence of a foreign body within the vasculature. For patients with central venous access, a wide variation in the incidence of vein thrombosis (1 to 66 percent) is reported and the incidence depends upon the catheter type and location, criteria for diagnosis, and population studied =Misplacement= CVC misplacement is more common when the anatomy of the person is different or difficult due to injury or past surgery. CVCs can be mistakenly placed in an artery during insertion (for example, the carotid artery or vertebral artery when placed in the neck or common femoral artery when placed in the groin). During subclavian vein central line placement, the catheter can be accidentally pushed into the internal jugular vein on the same side instead of the superior vena cava. A chest x-ray is performed after insertion to rule out this possibility. The tip of the catheter can also be misdirected into the contralateral (opposite side) subclavian vein in the neck, rather than into the superior vena cava. The risk of misplacement is mitigated through the use of ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance which allows for direct visualization of the catheter during placement. Post procedure x-rays are also obtained to confirm proper positioning.

He obtained a doctorate in geological and mineralogical sciences from Moscow University and was the recipient of the Honored Geologist award of the RSFSR.  Biography  Chernov was the son of Alexander Alexandrovich Chernov (1877‚Äì1963), a Russian geologist and paleontologist, and his mother, Eugenia P. Magnushevska. He had a sister named Olga. Chernov married Tamara Chernova and they had three children‚Äîone son (Vadim Georgievich Chernov) and two daughters (Tamara and Tatiana). Chernov later remarried twice, to Marina and then to Lyuba, and had a third daughter‚ÄîEugenia. In 1930 Chernov graduated from the Geophysics Department (Faculty) of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow University. He was a member of the Moscow Society of Naturalists. 80px During the war years Georgy was evacuated to Syktyvkar to work from Arkhangelsk on the Northern Geological Survey. All forces of geologists were sent in search of raw materials needed for the front. In 1944 he conducted research on the Kozhim River, and later on the upper reaches of the Vangyr river. Here Chernov opened Vangyrskoe field, discovering piezoquartz, a valuable raw material for the electronic industry. Chernov received an award as discoverer of the deposit. From 1957 to 1967, Chernov was a senior researcher at the Institute of Geology, Komi Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1967 he retired and moved to Leningrad, where in 1968 he defended his doctoral thesis on \\"Paleozoic Bolshezemelskaya tundra and prospects of its oil and gas potential.\\" Later, under the same title, he published his major monograph in the academic journal \\"Science\\".  Achievements  Vorkuta gulag In 1924, eighteen year old Georgy Chernov took part in an expedition led by his father, Alexander Alexandrovich Chernov, which inspired him to make geology his vocation. Almost every year thereafter, from 1924 to 1984, he traveled to different areas of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug and the Komi Republic. In the summer of 1930 Chernov found high-energy coal at the Vorkuta River. Coal mining has been carried out there since 1931. Where these coal reserves were discovered Vorkuta industrial community was founded (supporting Vorkuta gulag) and it later became a city. For transportation on the Pechora River a coal port was built, which later became the city of Naryan-Mar. Tundra In 1940 an expedition led by engineer-geologist G.A. Chernov traveled to the coast of Khaipudyrskaya Bay (Barents Sea) to carry out a detailed geological survey and review the available information on the oil-bearing Usinsk area. Thus began Chernov's long-time efforts to find oil in the Bolshezemelskaya tundra. Chernov described this period of his life as discovering gas in Naryan-Mar, and oil deposits in the area of Colva and Kharyaga, at the mouth of the Black River, and on the coast of the Barents Sea. In 1973, at one of the most promising deposits, trained geologists found the first oil, Usinsk field, near the city of Usinsk. Chernov was also a talented popularizer of scientific knowledge. He wrote over 160 scientific papers, monographs and popular books on the history and archeology of the Timan-Pechora Basin. He published many popular works, including \\"Tourist trips to the Pechora Alps\\", \\"Half a century in the Pechora area\\", and dozens of articles and essays on the history of geological research in the Komi region. Chernov also published articles on tourism and environmental protection.  Honors  For the discovery of the Pechora coal basin Chernov was awarded a Title of honor, \\"The discoverer of the field.\\" In 2007, Vladimir Putin signed a decree awarding Chernov the fourth degree Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\". For participating in opening the Usinsk deposit in 1976 Chernov was awarded the second degree of the same Order and the sign \\"Pathfinder field\\". Georgy Chernov was awarded the medal \\"For Valiant Labor in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945\\", Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1946), the Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\" (1951), and the title Honored geologist of the RSFSR.

A broad range of biologically relevant systems with different sizes and levels of complexities including proteins, host‚Äìguest complexes, and drug-like small molecules have been selected to test the latest modeling methods and force fields in SAMPL. New experimental data, such as binding affinity and hydration free energy, are withheld from participants until the prediction submission deadline, so that the true predictive power of methods can be revealed. The most recent SAMPL5 challenge contains two prediction categories: the binding affinity of host‚Äìguest systems, and the distribution coefficients of drug-like molecules between water and cyclohexane. Since 2008, the SAMPL challenge series has attracted widespread interest from scientists engaged in the field of computer-aided drug design (CADD) around the world, and has resulted in well over 100 publications with many of them highly cited. The current SAMPL organizers include Prof. John Chodera at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Prof. Michael K. Gilson at University of California, San Diego, Prof. David Mobley at University of California, Irvine, and Prof. Michael Shirts, at University of Colorado, Boulder.  Project significance  The SAMPL challenge seeks to accelerate progress in developing quantitative, accurate drug discovery tools by providing prospective validation and rigorous comparisons for computational methodologies and force fields. Computer-aided drug design methods have been considerably improved over time, along with the rapid growth of high-performance computing capabilities. However, their applicability in the pharmaceutical industry are still highly limited, due to the insufficient accuracy. Lacking large-scale prospective validations, methods tend to suffer from over-fitting the pre-existing experimental data. To overcome this, SAMPL challenges have been organized as blind tests: each time new datasets are carefully designed and collected from academic or industrial research laboratories, and measurements are released shortly after the deadline of prediction submission. Researchers then can compare those high-quality, prospective experimental data with the submitted estimates. A key emphasis is on lessons learned, allowing participants in future challenges to benefit from modeling improvements made based on earlier challenges. SAMPL has historically focused on the properties of host‚Äìguest systems and drug-like small molecules. These simply model systems require considerably less computational resources to simulate, compared to the protein systems, and thus enable much faster convergence. Meanwhile, through careful design, these model systems can be used to focus on one particular or a subset of simulation challenges. The past several SAMPL host‚Äìguest, hydration free energy and log D challenges revealed the limitations in generalized force fields, facilitated the development of solvent models, and highlighted the importance of properly handling protonation states and salt effects.  Participation  Registration and participation is free for SAMPL challenges. Beginning with SAMPL7, challenge participation data was posted on the SAMPL website, as well as the GitHub page for the specific challenge. Instructions, input files and results were then provided through GitHub (earlier challenges provided content primarily through D3R for SAMPL4-5, and via other means for earlier SAMPLs). Participants were allowed to submit multiple predictions through the D3R website, either anonymously or with research affiliation. Since the SAMPL2 challenge, all participants have been invited to attend the SAMPL workshops and submit manuscripts to describe their results. After a peer-review process, the resulting papers, along with the overview papers which summarize all submitting data, were published in the special issues of the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design.  Funding  The SAMPL project was recently funded by the NIH (grant GM124270-01A1), for the period of Sept. 2018 through August 2022, to allow the design of future SAMPL challenges to drive advances in the areas they are most needed for modeling efforts. The effort is spearheaded by David L. Mobley (UC Irvine) with co-investigators John D. Chodera (MSKCC), Bruce C. Gibb (Tulane), and Lyle Isaacs (Maryland). Currently challenges and workshops are run in partnership with the NIH-funded Drug Design Data Resource, but this will likely change over time as funding for the two projects is not coupled. Funding also allowed a broadening of scope of SAMPL; through SAMPL6, its role had been seen as primarily focused on physical properties, with D3R handling protein-ligand challenges. However, the funded effort broadened its focus to include systems which will drive improvements in modeling, including potentially suitable protein-ligand systems. This is still in contrast to D3R, which relies on donated datasets of pharmaceutical interest, whereas SAMPL challenges are specifically designed to focus on specific modeling challenges.  History  = Earlier SAMPL challenges = The first SAMPL exercise, SAMPL0 (2008) focused on the predictions of solvation free energies of 17 small molecules. A research group at Stanford University and scientists at OpenEye Scientific Software carried out the calculations. Despite the informal format, SAMPL0 laid the groundwork for the following SAMPL challenges. SAMPL1 (2009) and SAMPL2 challenges (2010) were organized by OpenEye and continued to focus on predicting solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules. Attempts were also made to predict binding affinities, binding poses and tautomer ratios. Both challenges attracted significant participations from computational scientists and researchers in academia and industry. = SAMPL3 and SAMPL4 = The blinded data sets for host‚Äìguest binding affinities were introduced for the first time in SAMPL3 (2011-2012), along with solvation free energies for small molecules and the binding affinity data for 500 fragment-like tyrosine inhibitors. Three host molecules were all from the cucurbituril family. The SAMPL3 challenge received 103 submissions from 23 research groups worldwide. Different from the prior three SAMPL events, the SAMPL4 exercise (2013-2014) was coordinated by academic researchers, with logistical support from OpenEye. Datasets in SAMPL4 consisted of binding affinities for host‚Äìguest systems and HIV integrase inhibitors, as well as hydration free energies of small molecules. Host molecules included cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and octa-acid. The SAMPL4 hydration challenge involved 49 submissions from 19 groups. The participation of the host‚Äìguest challenge also grew significantly compared to SAMPL3. The workshop was held at Stanford University in September, 2013. = SAMPL5 = The protein-ligand challenges were separated from SAMPL in SAMPL5 (2015-2016) and were distributed as the new Grand Challenges of the Drug Design Data Resource (D3R). SAMPL5 allowed participants to make predictions of the binding affinities of three sets of host‚Äìguest systems: an acyclic CB7 derivative and two host from the octa-acid family. Participants were also encouraged to submit predictions for binding enthalpies. A wide array of computational methods were tested, including density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics, docking, and metadynamics. The distribution coefficient predictions were introduced for the first time, receiving total of 76 submissions from 18 researcher groups or scientists for a set of 53 small molecules. The workshop was held in March, 2016 at University of California, San Diego as part of the D3R workshop. The top-performing methods in the host‚Äìguest challenge yielded encouraging yet imperfect correlations with experimental data, accompanied by large, systematic shifts relative to experiment. = SAMPL6 = The SAMPL6 testing systems include cucurbit[8]uril, octa-acid, tetra-endo-methyl octa- acid, and a series of fragment-like small molecules. The host‚Äìguest, conformational sampling and pKa prediction challenges of SAMPL6 are now closed. The SAMPL6 workshop was jointly run with the D3R workshop on Feb. 22 and 23, 2018, in Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA (https://drugdesigndata.org//about/d3r-2018-workshop), and a recent SAMPL special issue of the Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design reported many of the results. A SAMPL6 Part II challenge focused on a small octanol-water partition coefficient prediction set and was followed by a virtual workshop on May 16, 2019, and a joint D3R/SAMPL workshop in San Diego, Aug 22-23, 2019, immediately before the San Diego ACS National Meeting. A special issue or special section of JCAMD is planned to report the results. SAMPL6 inputs and (as challenge components are completed, results) are available via the SAMPL6 GitHub repository. = SAMPL7 = SAMPL7 again included host-guest challenges and a physical property challenge. A protein-ligand binding challenge on PHIPA fragments was also included. Host-guest binding focused on several small molecules binding to octa-acid and exo-octa-acid; binding of two compounds to a series of cyclodextrin derivatives; and binding of a series of small molecules to a clip-like guest known as TrimerTrip.

Description and history The Viola Coombs House stands on the north side of Main Street (Maine State Route 125), a short way east of its junction with Center Street and Back Hill Road. It is set between the Italianate Robert P. Carr House (to its left), and the Second Baptist Church (to its right). The Coombs House is a two-story wood frame structure, roughly rectangular in plan, with a hip roof pierced on its front face by a hipped dormer. The roof has extended eaves, particularly over the front right corner of the house, which is clipped to an angle; the eaves are studded with decorative brackets. The dominant feature of the house is its porch, which extends across the front and around the right side. Its roof is supported by bulky Tuscan columns, with a balustrade of turned spindles. The main entrance is framed by sidelight and transom windows, with slender Tuscan columns flanking its outer edges. The interior features high quality period woodwork that is largely unaltered. The house was built circa 1910 for Viola V. Coombs, a Bowdoinham native born in 1844. She commissioned the design from Harry S. Coombs, of Lewiston's Coombs Brothers architectural firm, then one of the state's leading architects.

One of the first Nigerian female lawmakers. Born to the Joseph and Magaret Onwuegbuzia of Umuagu quarters, Asaba now in Delta State, Nigeria, Janet attended Teachers' Training College (1930-1932), where she obtained her Grade II Teachers' certificate. She was appointed special political adviser to the Government of Anambra State from 1980 to 1983. Janet strongly believed in ecumenism and worked closely with her friend, Lady Eudora Ibiam towards that. She led Oraifite Anglican Women's Conference for twenty- five years until she stepped down in 1995. During this period, she spearheaded the building of Boys Secondary School, Oraifite and a weaving industry amongst others. She inculcated discipline and moral values among women who respected her. A pioneer Knight of the Order of the Saint Christopher in the old Diocese on The Niger, her role as a leader and motivator enhanced the many activities she undertook. Generous to a fault, she always supported the poor, giving money, food and clothing. Janet has made various contributions towards the uplifting of women through her political activities. She believed in equity and pioneered several pieces of legislation such as the one that married women be paid same salary as their male counterparts. In 1949, the police killed twenty one miners who were protesting non payment of mine allowance in Enugu. Mokelu mobilized the women and demonstrated against the killing. They demanded that the policemen involved in the shooting be prosecuted and executed. They also condemned the colonial policy in all ramifications. She believed strongly that all women should vote and be voted for. Her bills as a parliamentarian attest to these. (See Parliamentary Debates of Eastern House of Chiefs.

It is the 7th largest bank in Denmark. As of 2014 the bank has 70 branches in Denmark. History The bank was founded by Danish trade unions, the Social Democrats and Arbejderkul (union of coal workers) with a initial capital of DKK 2 million, most of which was pledged by Arbejderkul, who were particularly powerful after performing a crucial role in securing Denmark's energy supply during World War I. Although the bank was officially a public company, the shares could not be listed and remained with the labour movement. In practice the bank operated as a cooperative. During the great depression, major shareholder Arbejderkul ran into trouble and the trade union federation joined the ownership of the bank. In the 1960s the bank went through a major growth period, attracting new private customers and many independent branches were opened throughout Denmark. In 1986, ALFINA was bought and later renamed to AL Finans A/S. The bank also owns a share in √òstjydsk Bank.

Meanwhile, in 1998, Gunter Schmidt described Vitalius vulpinus as a separate species, with Rog√©rio Bertani changing the name to Nhandu vulpinus in 2001. Roberto Nagahama, Caroline Fukushima, and Bertani recognized H. tripepii as Nhandu tripepii and made N. vulpinus a senior synonym of N. tripepii. Characteristics Nhandu tripepii has a tibial spur, and when this is flexed, the retrolateral branch touches the first metatarsus. The female is distinguished by its long spermathecae and solid colouration. The type male is 5 cm, and the female is 8 cm. As a pet Nhandu tripepii is skittish and quite aggressive; therefore, it is not ideal for beginners. It has weak venom but urticating hair. It has 500-1500 spiderlings and is relatively easy to breed. Females have a lifespan of 10 years in captivity but as they grow quickly, reach maturity at about three years. It needs a temperature of 25-29 ¬∞C and a humidity of 75-80%.Nhandu trpepii. DcTarantulas.Weebly.com. Retrieved February 11, 2016.

Escape Artists Motion Pictures were revealed as the film's producers and stated that the film would begin production during late 2015. The film began production during December 2015 in Alathur, Thanjavur Pattukottai, Madukkur, Keeramangalam and Thambikkottai, with Karthik Kumar joining the team. The film went through a change of producers in early 2016, with Arasu Films briefly attached to the project before Vemal took over as the main producer with his newly launched A3V Cinemaz. He thus chose to prioritise the production of Mannar Vagaiyara and opted against working on other projects simultaneously. As a result of his busy schedule, Prabhu replaced Sathyaraj in the film, while Anandhi was signed on as the female lead. Soori was supposed to work on the film, but his busy schedule meant that Robo Shankar later took the role, and parodied Dhanush's character in Maari (2015) as a part of his character. Production continued throughout 2016 but was delayed in December following the effects of Cyclone Vardah. The team planned to release the film for the Pongal season of 2018, but were forced to delay due to a lack of screens. Vimal had written an emotional letter to theatre owners to screen his film for Pongal, but later accepted to delay the film for two weeks. The Satellite rights of this movie sold to Zee Tamil. Soundtrack The film's music was composed by Jakes Bejoy, and the soundtrack was released on 3 January 2018 through New Music. Release Tamil Nadu theatrical rights of the film were sold for 5.5 crore.

A former slave, Endsley eventually ran one of the city's largest railroad-yard coal and log businesses.  Biography  Endsley was born into slavery in Jefferson, where she worked on a plantation. In 1862, she married Moses Calloway, and the two moved to Rowlett. The couple started out as sharecroppers, but eventually owned their own farm. Together, they had eleven children. Endsley took over as the manager of the 100-acre family farm when her husband died in the late 1880s or early 1890s. The farm was in Dallas County and had been assessed in 1882 to be worth $15,150. Endlsley would take her own cotton to the local cotton gin, and defended her hard work from theft, even accidentally killing a white man who attempted to steal her cotton. She was never prosecuted for striking the man; since another \\"white man who witnessed the accident apparently took the blame for it.\\" Endsley married three times after her first husband, all ending in divorce until she married H.E. Endsley in 1914. She sold her farm, retaining the timber rights on the land, and set up her own rail-yard coal and log business in Dallas. Her sons, Joe, Lube and Emmett, helped her run the business, which became very lucrative. Endsley's home had the only telephone in the neighborhood for many years, and she allowed neighbors to use it. She and others helped found the Macedonia Baptist Church, which eventually became a 5,000 member congregation called the Good Street Baptist Church.

As an informant, he infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan to monitor and disrupt it, and incited violence as part of the FBI's COINTELPRO project. Rowe was accused of participating in and helping to plan violent Klan activity against African Americans and civil rights groups. From 1965 until his death, Rowe was a figure of recurring controversy after he testified against fellow Klansmen who were accused of killing Viola Gregg Liuzzo, a civil rights volunteer. He was accused of being an accessory to the murder. Other violent acts that he was accused of, and at times admitted to planning and perpetrating, include the attack on the Freedom Riders and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. He was given immunity by the FBI and he was never convicted of any wrongdoing. Rowe confirmed many of these accusations in his 1976 autobiography, My Undercover Years with the Ku Klux Klan, and in confession and testimony given to the United States Senate.  Background  Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. was born on August 13, 1933, in Savannah, Georgia, to Gary Thomas Rowe and Alma Ann Sellars. He dropped out of high school to join the Georgia National Guard and United States Marine Corps Reserves. After his discharge, Rowe attempted to join the county sheriff's department but his application was rejected because he did not have a high school diploma. He earned a living as a nightclub bouncer, and he worked briefly with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, helping them bust up illegal alcohol stills in return for cheap firearms. Rowe was married four times, fathered three children and adopted two children. Recruitments by the FBI and the Ku Klux Klan Rowe was recruited by FBI Special Agent Barrett G. Kemp in April 1960. The FBI discovered that the Klan was attempting to recruit Rowe, a man known for his work with the ATF and who was seeking a career in law enforcement. The FBI decided that what made him a good candidate for the Klan also made him a good candidate to be an informant against the Klan for the FBI. In 1975, when in front of the Senate committee, Rowe told them that the FBI knew and disregarded his participation in the violent attacks on African Americans and was also tasked with causing friction within the KKK by having sexual relations with some of the Klansmen's wives. Rowe successfully infiltrated Eastview Klavern 13, the most violent chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in American history, in May 1960. He began receiving payments from the FBI for \\"services rendered,\\" and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover personally approved these payments. The payments that Rowe received from the FBI ranged between from $80 to $250 with the addition of expenses.  Involvement in the Ku Klux Klan  = Mob attack on the Freedom Riders = In 1961, Gary Thomas Rowe helped plan and lead a violent mob attack against the Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama. He worked together with the Birmingham Police Commissioner, Bull Connor, and Police Sergeant Tom Cook (an avid Ku Klux Klan supporter) to organize violence against the Freedom Riders with local Ku Klux Klan chapters. They assured Rowe that the mob would have 15 minutes to attack the bus before any arrests were made. Rowe admitted to using a baseball bat during the attack, in which the mob attacked the Greyhound bus carrying the Freedom Riders at a bus station in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, Mothers Day. They slashed the tires and set the bus on fire with the Freedom Riders still inside. The mob held the doors shut, intending to let the peaceful civil rights group burn alive, but a small explosion scared them back from the door. As the Freedom Riders exited the bus, they were badly beaten by the mob and many had to be taken to hospitals which refused to treat them. Although there were state patrolmen there during the incident and they gave off warning shots to call off the mob, they did very little to protect the Freedom Riders from being burnt alive and beaten. The majority of the Freedom Riders that were intercepted in Anniston sustained many life-threatening injuries either from the beatings done by the Ku Klux Klan, or from prolonged exposure to the smoke and fumes from the destroyed bus, and were sent to Anniston Memorial Hospital for immediate attention. When an ambulance arrived, some of the black Freedom Riders were refused a ride to the hospital by the driver until several white Freedom Riders who were injured, got off the bus and only came if their fellow Riders who were black could be allowed to ride. When the injured Freedom Riders arrived at the hospital there was no doctor present, only nurses to provide aid to those in need. They were eventually denied receiving medical attention since they \\"caused a commotion\\" by bringing the white mob over to the hospital. Even though Gary Thomas Rowe informed the FBI three weeks prior that the attack on Freedom Riders would happen, they decided not to intervene but only to ask what had happened to Genevieve Hughes, who was one of the injured Freedom Riders, with her only stating, \\"When I woke up the nurse asked me if I could talk with the FBI. The FBI man did not care about us, but only the bombing\\". The Freedom Riders were attacked by the KKK again in Birmingham. And again, Gary Thomas Rowe played a central role in the mobbing and with the help of Commissioner Bull Connor. They used iron pipes, baseball bats and bicycle chains to beat the Freedom Riders as they left the bus. Years later, Rowe recalled how a call from police headquarters to Rowe had tipped them off to when and where to attack the Freedom Riders in Birmingham, saying: > We made an astounding sight ... men running and walking down the streets of > Birmingham on Sunday afternoon carrying chains, sticks, and clubs. > Everything was deserted; no police officers were to be seen except one on a > street corner. He stepped off and let us go by, and we barged into the bus > station and took it over like an army of occupation. There were Klansmen in > the waiting room, in the rest rooms, in the parking area. A photograph of Rowe and several others, including Eastview Klavern leader Hubert Page, beating George Webb on May 14, 1961, was taken by Tommy Langston of the Birmingham Post-Herald, who was also caught and beaten. Although the camera was smashed, the film survived and the photo became one of only a few pieces of physical evidence of Rowe's involvement. = 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing = In 1963, Gary Thomas Rowe may have helped perpetrate the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing that killed four young girls. One of the Klansman eventually convicted of the crime, Robert E. Chambliss, said that it was Rowe who bombed the church. Rowe, who was no stranger to dynamite, had twice failed polygraph tests when questioned as to his possible involvement in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, investigative records show. Because of this, the FBI and the prosecution did not use Rowe as a witness in Chambliss's trial. The FBI also said to believe that Rowe was supposedly involved with the bombing of Martin Luther King Jr.'s motel room at the Gaston Motel on May 11, 1963, as well as the bombing of Martin Luther King Jr.'s brothers house and parsonage. Through one of his African American informants, Rowe claimed that it was black Muslims who were responsible for placing the bombs there. Rowe was eventually arrested by Alabama police with several other Klansmen after being tipped off, in June 1963 for having a truck full of assorted firearms and explosives that were to be used at the University of Alabama to prevent the admission of James Hood and Vivian Malone. But was soon later released from jail with their weapons. = The murder of Viola Liuzzo = In 1965, Rowe was involved in the murder of civil rights activist Viola Liuzzo as she was returning from the Selma to Montgomery marches with other activists. Rowe was in the car with three other Klansman as they chased Viola's car after they saw a black man in the passenger seat. They pulled up next to her car and shot her dead. Rowe gave this testimony in court as he testified against the three other Klansman: Collie Leroy Wilkins Jr., William Orville Eaton, and Eugene Thomas. The FBI attempted to downplay the situation and discredit Liuzzo by spreading rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party, was a heroin addict, and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement. This came at a time when the Bureau was also trying to smear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Communist party. In 1965, Rowe testified as a trial witness against the three other Klansman involved in the murder of Viola Liuzzo. Because he provided information that led to the conviction of his fellow Klansman, Federal authorities placed Rowe in the Witness Protection Program under the name of Thomas Neil Moore. Following the testimony, Rowe was rewarded with a job as a deputy U.S. Marshal. Rowe was relocated to his home town of Savannah, Georgia. Later that year, Alabama authorities attempted to have Rowe extradited back to Alabama to charge him the murder of Luizzo. However, they were unsuccessful. Rowe claimed that the FBI promised him complete immunity for the information he provided that led to the conviction of the other Klansman.  Later years and death  After Rowe testified against fellow Klansman in the Luizzo case in 1965, Rowe was relocated to Savannah, Georgia, his home town, where he worked for the U.S. Marshals and for a private security company. For the rest of his life, Rowe would be a highly controversial figure. However, he was never convicted of any wrongdoing. Rowe surfaced in 1975 before a congressional committee. Wearing a bizarre cotton hood that resembled the Klan headpiece to conceal his new identity, Rowe told the Senate committee that the FBI had known and approved of his violence against blacks. He testified that the FBI did nothing to stop the violence, even when he gave them advance warning. In 1978, Rowe confessed to killing an unknown black man in a riot with a firearm, a previously undisclosed crime. By making this confession, one of the investigation memos suggests that Rowe may have been bargaining for blanket immunity for whatever occurred while he was an informant. In 1979 his autobiography was adapted into the NBC TV movie Undercover with the KKK starring Don Meredith as Rowe. At the age of 64, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. died of a heart attack on May 25, 1998 in Savannah, Georgia. He was buried under the name Thomas Neil Moore, the name given to him by the Witness Protection Program. According to Eugene Brooks, who had been Rowe's lawyer, Rowe had become bankrupt and had long been divorced from his fourth wife.

The riot was the most deadly in Mexican penal history, surpassing the death toll of the 2012 Apodaca prison riot. After the rioting, authorities uncovered 'luxury cells' prison leaders had. Among the items confiscated included televisions, mini-fridges, aquariums, and saunas.  Background  The Topo Chico prison houses 3,800 inmates, over 35% of capacity overseen by 100 guards. According to Mexican media, the prison was controversially known for being overcrowded and ungovernable.  Prison riot  The riot started at 11:30 p.m, the cause was an internal dispute between members of the Los Zetas drug cartel. A rival faction of the gang was led by Juan Pedro Saldivar-Far√≠as (known as \\"El Z-27\\"), against a faction led by Jorge Iv√°n Hern√°ndez Cant√∫ (alias \\"El Credo\\"). Hern√°ndez was at first reported by Mexican media to have ties to the Gulf Cartel, a fierce rival to the Zetas, but it was later confirmed that the fight broke out between members of the same criminal organization. The fighting was allegedly triggered by a warring dispute between Saldivar over control of the prison from Hern√°ndez. The rioting began when Saldivar mobilized a group of prisoners to attack rival leader Hern√°ndez, but they failed to reach his cell. The rioting took place in two separate units of the prison complex, and inmates used a combination of weapons such as wooden bats, sticks, razor blades, bottles, and chairs during the melee. Fire was set to a food storage and the blaze spread to a section housing prison cells. The fighting continued until 1:30 p.m, when the Mexican Army along with federal and local police subdued the rioting. According to Nuevo Leon state Governor Jaime Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n, the riot was not an attempt at escape but a fight between the two rival groups. No prisoners had escaped during the riot.  Fatalities  Forty of the victims have been identified, while five were unrecognizable, charred by the fire. All of the fatalities were inmates and 40 of them were killed from strikes and blows delivered by hammers, cudgels, and knives. In all, 60 hammers, 86 knives and 120 shivs were used. The sole fatality of a gunshot wound was an inmate who was killed by a guard protecting a group of women. The guard, Jose Reyes Hernandez, was later charged with murder.  Arrests  A state prosecutor charged prison director Gregoria Salazar Robles and superintendent Jesus Fernando Dominguez Jaramillo for not maintaining the necessary security measures inside the prison. Investigators determined inmates had bats and metal bars that were used in the riot. Some cells did not have locks and inmates were out and about at times they should not have been.  Aftermath  After the riot, authorities seized various kinds of contraband items, such as half a kilogram of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs, televisions, and USB memory sticks. Also dismantled were 'luxury cells'. Zetas leader Jorge Iv√°n Hern√°ndez Cant√∫ had his cell equipped with a king-size bed, a luxury bath and a huge television, other inmates had air conditioners, mini-fridges, aquariums and portable saunas. Police also dismantled 280 inmate-run food stalls, a bar and hundreds of altars to Santa Muerte, a death-like figure revered by many members of Mexico's drug cartels.  Reactions  Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n blamed the rioting on \\"the old, outdated, obsolete system\\" under which Mexican prisons are run. During a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis sent a message of condolences to the archbishop of Monterrey and the families of those killed. Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto said his administration will \\"continue to work in coordination with the state authorities\\" to secure the safety of the nation's often overcrowded and gang-controlled penitentiaries.

The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm: The Riemannian orbit model Shapes in Computational Anatomy (CA) are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template I_{temp} , resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random orbit model of CA. For images these are defined as I \\\\in \\\\mathcal {I} \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ I = I_{temp} \\\\circ \\\\varphi, \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Diff}_V \\\\\\\\} , with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ \\\\varphi \\\\cdot m_{temp} : \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Diff}_V \\\\\\\\}. The Riemannian metric The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy are generated by the group action\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ \\\\varphi \\\\cdot m : \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Diff}_V \\\\\\\\}.

The Lie bracket in the group of diffeomorphisms The Lie bracket gives the adjustment of the velocity term resulting from a perturbation of the motion in the setting of curved spaces. Using Hamilton's principle of least-action derives the optimizing flows as a critical point for the action integral of the integral of the kinetic energy. The Lie bracket for vector fields in Computational Anatomy was first introduced in Miller, Trouve and Younes. The derivation calculates the perturbation \\\\delta v on the vector fields v^\\\\varepsilon = v + \\\\varepsilon \\\\delta v in terms of the derivative in time of the group perturbation adjusted by the correction of the Lie bracket of vector fields in this function setting involving the Jacobian matrix, unlike the matrix group case: Proof: Proving Lie bracket of vector fields take a first order perturbation of the flow at point \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Diff}_V . The Lie bracket gives the first order variation of the vector field with respect to first order variation of the flow. : \\\\delta v_t = \\\\frac{d}{d t} w_t - ad_{v_t}(w_t) =\\\\frac{d}{d t} w_t- ((Dv_t) w_t - (Dw_t)v_t) \\\\ . The generalized Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation for the metric on diffeomorphic flows  The Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation can be used to calculate geodesic flows through the group which form the basis for the metric. The action integral for the Lagrangian of the kinetic energy for Hamilton's principle becomes The action integral in terms of the vector field corresponds to integrating the kinetic energy : J(v) \\\\doteq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\ v_t \\\\_V^2 dt = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_X Av_t \\\\cdot v_t \\\\,dx \\\\ dt \\\\ . The shortest paths geodesic connections in the orbit are defined via Hamilton's Principle of least action requires first order variations of the solutions in the orbits of Computational Anatomy which are based on computing critical points on the metric length or energy of the path. The original derivation of the Euler equation associated to the geodesic flow of diffeomorphisms exploits the was a generalized function equation whenAv \\\\in V^* is a distribution, or generalized function, take the first order variation of the action integral using the adjoint operator for the Lie bracket () gives for all smooth w \\\\in V , : \\\\frac{d}{d \\\\varepsilon} J(\\\\varphi^\\\\varepsilon)_{\\\\varepsilon=0} = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_X Av_t \\\\cdot \\\\delta v_t\\\\,dx \\\\, dt = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_X Av_t \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{d t} w_t -( (Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) \\\\right)\\\\,dx \\\\,dt.

The khawal (plural khawalat) () was a traditional native Egyptian male dancer cross-dressed in feminine attire and was popular up until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. History Following prohibitions on women dancing in public, cross-dressing boys and men took their place throughout the Middle East; in some Arab countries, these transvestite dancers were known as gawwal, and in Egypt, they were known by the related term khawal. The khawal imitated female ghawazi by dancing with castanet self accompaniment, painting their hands with henna, braiding their long hair, plucking their facial hair, wearing make-up, and adopting the manners of women. > As they impersonate women, their dances are exactly of the same description > as those of the Ghawazee [female dancers] ... Their general appearance ... > is more feminine than masculine: they suffer the hair of the head to grow > long, and generally braid it, in the manner of women ... they imitate the > women also in applying kohl and henna to their eyes and hands like women. In > the streets, when not engaged in dancing, they often veil their faces; not > from shame, but merely to affect the manners of women. Khawal distinguished themselves from women by wearing a mix of men's and women's clothing. The khawal performed at various functions such as weddings, births, circumcisions, and festivals. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, they also commonly performed for foreign visitors, variously shocking or delighting them.George Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures (2003, ), page 952. The khawal were perceived as sexually available; their male audiences found their ambiguity seductive. In modern Egyptian slang, the term is derogatory and refers to a passive gay man.

He was active both in building design and restoration, and was associated with the National Museum for many years. His building designs are strongly influenced by his interest in historic architecture. He collaborated with his more well-known colleague Ulrik Plesner on many projects. Early life and education Mathiesen was born in Aarhus but the family moved to Copenhagen in 1872 where his father Rasmus Langeland Mathiesen became building inspector of the Danish capital. Aage Langeland-Mathiesen completed a carpenter's apprenticeship and studied at Copenhagen Technical College before enrolling at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1884. He became an executing architect at Hermann Baag√∏e Storck prior to his graduation in January 1895. In 1897, he won the Neuhausen Prize for a model of Copenhagen's third city hall and received the academy's travel grant. Career He worked for Valdemar Koch from 1894 to 1898 on the measurement of Danish medieval churches and was later associated with the National Museum for fifteen years. He was represented at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1897-1903 and at the 18 November Exhibition in 1927 and 1930. Style Langeland-Mathiesen's style was strongly influenced by his interest in historic architecture. He found inspiration in Renaissance and Baroque architecture, combining it with modern techniques and craftsmanship. Other works, such as Glacisg√•rden, was in Jugendstil. The work he created in collaboration with Ulrik Plesner are characterized by a more consistent style influenced by the Bedre Byggeskik movement, Baroque and Romantic Nationalism. Other pursuits He was vice president of the Danish Motor Vehicle Owners' Association (FDM) and chairman of the Glacisgaarden Motorcycle Club. He was also archivist for the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society. He worked on a book about the Royal Shooting Society which was published posthumously. He is buried at Frederiksberg Old Cemetery.

Description and history Grant Street Pier The park is part of a , 21-block mixed-use urban redevelopment with office and retail spaces, and residential units. The site was originally home to a paper mill owned by Boise Cascade that closed in 2005. It was acquired by real estate developer Columbia Waterfront LLC in 2008 and a master plan from the firm was approved by the city government the following year. New street connections were built from the north in 2014 and 2015. The M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust was announced as the first office tenant for the project in 2015. The $1.3 billion project, consisting of a city park and pier and five residential, office and retail buildings, began construction in 2016. The park opened September 29, 2018. At the park's opening, the city officials celebrated Esther Short, who donated a large parcel of land that included the development's campus. Short's goal, with her donation, included giving access to the general public to the scenic location. The city installed a pair of Portland Loo public toilets at the park in October 2018. The loos are especially designed to remain open 24/7. Slats allow a potential user to see if the toilet is already occupied, and if more than one individual is inside. They are large enough that a user can wheel in a child's stroller, shopping buggy, bicycle, or dog. The bathrooms installed in Vancouver are equipped with both a table for changing babies, and a bin for addicts to safely dispose of used needles.

It used Openbox as the window manager and tools taken from LXDE, Gnome, XFCE as well as a number of other utilities. It was a cloud- centric operating system that was heavily focused on the Chromium Browser. Cub Linux's tagline was \\"Cub = Chromium + Ubuntu\\".  History  Cub Linux was originally called Chromixium OS. The developer, RichJack, initially announced the project on the Ubuntu user forums on September 19, 2014. Since then, the project released the first stable version, Chromixium 1.0 as a 32 bit live ISO on April 26, 2015. This was followed by a service pack to address a number of issues such as screen tearing and slow menu generation. In July 2015, a number of updates were rolled into a new release, version 1.5. This was initially 32 bit only, but was followed by a 64 bit release in November 2015. At some point towards the end of 2015, Google, who owns the rights to the Chrome OS and Chromium trademarks, requested that RichJack cease use of the Chromixium mark and related websites and social media presences. On January 17, 2016, RichJack announced that Chromixium would be changing name to Cub Linux with immediate effect and that the Chromixium name would be completely dropped by 31 March 2016.Google Asks Chromixium OS Devs to Cease Use of the Name, Cub Linux Is Born, Softpedia News Towards the end of 2016, the Cub Linux website mysteriously disappeared.

He has been shortlisted for the Prime Minister‚Äôs Literary Awards, the Age Book of the Year, and been named a Sydney Morning Herald Best Young Australian Novelist. His creative work has been supported by grants from the Literature Board of the Australia Council. He is Associate Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Technology, Sydney. He has been a regular contributor of book reviews, feature articles and essays to the national media, principally in the area of international literary fiction. He has been called a post-grunge lit writer, a reference to an Australian literary genre from the 2000s which emerged following the 1990s grunge lit genre.  Capital novels  The main concerns of the Capital novels are \\"the increasing penetration of market forces into everyday life\\" (Sydney Review of Books), and the effect of \\"the last several decades of capitalist ‚Äòprogress‚Äô ‚Ä¶ [on] ‚Äòthe life-worlds of ordinary people\\" (The Conversation). In Capital, Volume One, Macris employs techniques from the French Nouveau Roman to produce a vital yet impersonal tracking of the movement of dead commodities in a London Underground train station. IN this track of the novel, Macris presents a dystopia of the marketisation of quotidian, globalised life, alluding to Marx's study of the commodity form and to the journey of Leopold Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses. These impersonal chapters focused on the London Underground are contrasted with memoir-like fragments from a failed bildungsroman, in which assemblages of neoliberal capitalism‚Äîcombining with pop musical and film culture, with the petroleum industry, with the higher education and restaurant sectors‚Äîare presented as both subject-forming and subject-de-forming. Working alongside the clearly critical intent of the novel is a joyful, disorienting experimentation with subject, time and place, producing something like a sublime rhythmic composition that, rather than falling into the negative, critical gravity of the novel's content, suggests ways out of this neoliberal dystopia.

He served as spokesman from the beginning of the Saudi intervention until 27 July 2017, when he was replaced by Colonel Turki bin Saleh al-Malki. Biography  =Yemen war= Mohammed bin Salman and Ahmad Asiri meeting US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, 2016 Brigadier-General Asiri is the former spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, during the Yemeni Civil War. On 8 May 2015, the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire Houthi stronghold cities of Sa'dah and Marran to be military targets. Asiri issued what became known as the May Declaration, telling the media: \\"Starting today and as you all remember we have declared through media platforms and through the leaflets that were dropped on Marran and Saada, and prior warnings to Yemeni civilians in those two cities, to get away from those cities where operations will take place. This warning will end at 7 p.m. today and coalitions forces will immediately respond to the actions of these militias that targeted the security and safety of the Saudi citizens from now and until the objectives of this operation are reached. We have also declared Saada and Marran as military targets loyal to the Houthi militias and as a result the operations will cover the whole area of those two cities and thus we repeat our call to the civilians to stay away from these groups, and leave the areas under Houthi control or where the Houthis are taking shelter.\\" The May declaration was criticised by Human Rights Watch who said: \\"Several attacks on apparently civilian objects that Human Rights Watch investigated in Saada, including an attack that struck a residential house, two attacks that struck markets, and an attack on a school, took place after 8 May announcement. Issuing warning of impending attacks to the civilian population is in line with the obligation under the laws of war to take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm, and in particular to provide \\"effective advance warning\\" of attacks that may affect the civilian population, so long as circumstances permit. However, the general and vague nature of these warnings would be of little help to civilians in need of greater security. Even more problematic, and a clear violation of the laws of war, is the coalition assertion that the entire cities of Saada and Marran are military targets. The laws of war prohibit attacks that treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects. In February 2016, Asiri declared: \\"Now our rules of engagement are: you are close to the border, you are killed.\\" This statement was once again criticised by Human Rights Watch who replied: \\"Treating an entire area as the object of military attack violates the laws- of-war prohibition on attacks that treat distinct military objectives in a city, town or area as a single military objective. Doing so unlawfully denies civilians protection from attack. In March 2017, Asiri, at a think tank forum in London, was the target of Sam Walton, a UK peace activist's attempt at a citizen's arrest over the Yemen war atrocities. Asiri shouted to the crowd outside the building and gave them the middle finger.Watch a UK peace activist attempt to arrest a Saudi general for war crimesSaudi general gives crowd the middle finger after dodging citizen's egg =Iran= In January 2017 George Nader arranged several meetings between among others, himself, Asiri, Joel Zamel, Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn.

Another military officer with much experience in dealing with dissidents was the second candidate for the mission. American television journalist Rachel Maddow pointed to reports by foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius explaining that Asiri planned to create a \\"tiger team\\" for covert Special operations. As \\"informed sources\\" in Washington were trying to work out who the possible scapegoat for the Khashoggi execution might be, and because Asiri also was the \\"point of contact\\" for crown prince Mohammad's offers of help to the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, which were part of Robert Mueller's investigation. Asiri would be the \\"two birds with one stone\\" cover up story. But retired US diplomats, like Barbara Bodine, a retired US ambassador to Yemen, and intelligence officials, like Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official at the Brookings Institution, were \\"already signalling that the line is a nonstarter\\".\\"Saudis Plan to Pin Khashoggi Slaying on ‚ÄòRogue‚Äô General\\", Daily Beast (16 October 2018).

In 2019 it was reported that Asiri had been \\"put on trial but acquitted\\", due to \\"insufficient evidence\\".

The episode was written by Angela Kang and Corey Reed, and directed by Kari Skogland. This episode marks the first appearance of the character \\"Jesus\\" from the comic, Paul Rovia, changed from Monroe, to distinguish from the first family of Alexandria. He is portrayed by Tom Payne. Plot After the passing of two months, the walls of the Alexandria Safe- Zone have been repaired and expanded, and the residents are living a seemingly normal lifestyle. Rick and Daryl are about to go on a supply run. Michonne asks Rick for spearmint and baking soda toothpaste, while Denise requests a specific soft drink so she can surprise Tara. Eugene maps out nearby agricultural suppliers, which could improve the dwindling food supply. Eugene's research leads Rick and Daryl to a truck that is filled with food, ammunition and other supplies including a case of toothpaste. They drive the truck along a different route to return to Alexandria, and stop at a gas station to loot a fallen vending machine. As they struggle to break into it, a long-haired masked man runs into Rick, claiming that he's running from a group of walkers. They all lie about not having a camp, and after Rick introduces himself and Daryl, the man removes his mask and gives his name as Paul Rovia, but tells them his friends call him Jesus. Rick starts to ask his three recruitment questions, despite Daryl's objections, but Jesus runs off. Rick and Daryl hear noises from behind the gas station and, forewarned of approaching walkers, decide to investigate, only to find firecrackers popping. Realizing that Jesus tricked them and pick-pocketed the truck's keys from Rick, they sprint back to see Jesus driving the truck away, dragging the vending machine behind it. Rick and Daryl pursue him on foot, eventually coming across the vending machine. Daryl breaks it open and obtains the drink requested by Denise, Orange Crush. As they catch their breath, Rick expresses his positive views on bringing more people into Alexandria. Later, the two catch up to the truck and find Jesus repairing a tire. They attack Jesus, who holds his own against the two of them until subdued at gunpoint. Rick leaves Jesus tied loosely on the side of the road, believing he could free himself once they're gone. When they drive across a field at the next farm, Rick and Daryl hear bumping on the truck's roof, and Rick rapidly brakes to send Jesus toppling from the top of the truck. Jesus runs and Daryl jumps out to pursue him, while Rick parks the truck near a lake and kills a few stray walkers. Jesus gets into the driver‚Äôs seat as Daryl fights him. Jesus grabs Daryl's handgun and shoots an approaching walker, saving Daryl's life. Daryl pulls Jesus from the truck, which is set into neutral and begins rolling backwards. Jesus is struck on the back of the head by the truck's door, knocking him out, as the truck rolls into the lake and submerges. Meanwhile, Carl and Enid venture into the woods. They come across a balloon with an illegible note, and Enid is hopeful about other people but Carl says they're probably dead already. They sit together, and Enid confesses that she doesn't like being out there anymore. On their way back, Carl spots a walker and attracts its attention to kill it, but when they see who it is Carl stops while Enid wants to kill it. The two argue, and Carl sends Enid back to Alexandria. As Michonne is patrolling the newly erected walls, she spots Spencer going into the woods alone with a shovel and sets after him. As they walk through the woods, Michonne spots Carl running and sees a lone walker, which is revealed to be a reanimated Deanna. With Michonne's assistance, Spencer stabs the walker and buries it, a large \\"D\\" carved on a tree to mark the grave. That night, Michonne confronts Carl about not killing the walker. He believes walkers should only be killed by someone who had loved them in life. When he tells her he would do it for her, Michonne embraces him. Rick and Daryl return to Alexandria with an unconscious Jesus, whom they leave tied up in a room. Rick and Michonne sit together on the couch in their living room. They laugh as they talk about their days, and soon begin holding hands and kissing intimately. Later that night, Rick and Michonne are naked, sleeping in bed together, when a voice is heard calling Rick. Michonne and Rick leap up and grab their weapons as the speaker is revealed to be Jesus, who is standing at the foot of the bed and says they need to talk. Production Actor Tom Payne, who plays the new character Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia, auditioned, was cast, and began filming the role all in the span of about a week. Andrew Lincoln has said in interview that he voiced his desire for \\"A Butch and Sundance kind of episode, where these guys are just hanging out\\" over a meal with Norman Reedus and Greg Nicotero, that they pitched it to Scott M. Gimple who found a place for it in the back eight [episodes], and writer Angela Kang dialed into it with a different flavour for the show. Lincoln spoke of his time filming the episode: Themes Darryl Woodard of The Huffington Post wrote that family is one of the most consistent themes voiced in The Walking Dead and Brian Moylan of The Guardian cited it as the biggest theme of the episode. Richard Nguyen of The Harvard Crimson points out that Spencer killing and burying his zombified mother, Deanna, grants him spiritual revitalization and emotional closure after the loss of his entire family. Michonne tells him that family in the new world isn't about blood but bonds of experience. Carl tells Michonne that Deanna needed to be killed by someone who loved her. Through this metaphor they say they love each other, Carl, Michonne and Rick move toward a new iteration of family, and one that is stronger because of their history together.  Music  This episode offered the following songs: * \\"More Than a Feeling\\" - Boston * \\"Action Packed\\" - Ronnie Dawson * \\"If My Heart Was A Car\\" - Old 97's Reception =Critical reception= The episode received highly positive reviews. It holds a 93% positive rating with an average score of 7.98 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \\"Vintage-style action and the spark of a hot new romance make \\"The Next World\\" a gratifying successor to the shocking mid-season premiere.\\" Lenika Cruz and David Sims of The Atlantic praise the much-needed time jump which refreshed the series from the brutal slog of previous episodes. Sims calls it, \\"A rather light, funny episode that ended on a surprising note‚Äîbut not a bloody one, for once.\\" Cruz called it one of the show's best hours. \\"Every pairing this week not only made sense, but also meaningfully advanced the story or the characters.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com also praised the episode for its humor, citing it as \\"the funniest episode of The Walking Dead ever.\\" Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler gave a good analysis saying: Despite having a few moments of danger, \\"The Next World\\" was the lightest, most joy-filled episode of The Walking Dead since the start. Hell, there were actual moments of (intentional) humor. Rick's new life feels earned and deserved and I loved how this episode allowed \\"No Way Out\\" - from last week, to be the definitive end point for the whole initial Alexandria arc by skipping over (what's usually) obligatory reflection and wallowing. John Saavedra of Den of Geek! praised the episode by saying: Holy mullet, am I about to describe an episode of The Walking Dead as \\"lighthearted?\\" Well, \\"The Next World\\" kind of is. This is at least, very definitely, The Walking Dead's version of a light action romp full of buddy cop fun. Last week, Robert Kirkman described tonight's episode as \\"almost like Lethal Weapon.\\" And he's not wrong, as Daryl points out at the end of \\"The Next World,\\" in a wonderful Murtaugh-inspired moment, that it's dumb for him and Rick to keep going out on reckless supply runs, just for the two of them to agree that they're just going to do it again the next day. As the men cheerfully walk out of the door‚Äîit's a shame no sax is playing in the background‚ÄîI got the sense that both Daryl and Rick had finally embraced their situation, not as the damning thing of past years, but as a challenge they need/will overcome. =Ratings= The episode averaged a 6.6 rating in adults 18-49, with 13.483 million viewers overall.

The action did not result in any changes to working conditions, but it led to the formation of new, national trade unions in the United Kingdom. Background In London, building trade workers had secured a maximum ten-hour working day in 1834, but despite several efforts to reduce hours either to nine per day, or to work only half days on Saturday, barely any further progress had been made. The sole exception was the strong Operative Society of Masons (OSM), whose members were generally able to finish work at 4 on Saturdays. In 1856, building workers in Manchester secured the right to finish work at 1 on Saturdays, and this inspired those in London to start a new campaign for shorter hours. In order to gain the support of both the OSM, the Operative Bricklayers' Society (OBS), and the unorganised carpenters, a Central Board agreed in 1858 to campaign for the nine-hour working day, the movement being led by George Potter. An initial petition was refused by employers, at which point Potter organised a permanent \\"Conference\\" to continued the campaign. The Conference began meeting in September 1858, and began attracting representatives of other building trades: painters, plasterers, and builders' labourers. The OSM walked out, preferring to campaign for an early finish on Saturdays, but soon returned, and R. W. Grey of the OSM became chair of the Conference. In its early period, the Conference tried to persuade employers of their case by presenting \\"memorials\\" to them, and it also published \\"Live and Let Live\\", an essay by Evan Daniel in support of its cause. These tactic proved unsuccessful, and in March 1859, the Conference called delegate meetings across London, where Potter spoke. It organised a ballot of affiliates, offering three options: further agitation, which received 1,395 votes, arbitration, with 1,157 votes, and strike action, which had just 772 votes. The strike and lock out Further agitation proved equally unproductive, and in June and July, the OBS and the carpenters both voted in favour of a strike, but the OSM and its leader, Richard Harnott, remained opposed, as did the smaller unions. The Conference decided to organise a petition to employers. One petition was presented to Trollope of Pimlico, which decided to sack the leader of the delegation which presented it, a member of the OSM. The OSM now sparked into action, withdrawing all its members from work for Trollope, and on 21 July the Conference made this a strike of all building workers at Trollope's, demanding both the reinstatement of the sacked worker, and the nine-hour day. The employers, working together as the Central Master Builders' Association, united to oppose the strike, all the larger firms locking out trade unionists within two weeks, leading to 24,000 people finding themselves without work. They would only take on employees who signed the Document, which declared that signatories would not hold membership of a trade union. Very few workers, even among non-unionists, would agree to sign this, and the Conference sent representatives to the rest of the country in an attempt to stop the deliveries of building supplies to London. To their surprise, the Conference's position was backed by some newspapers, including Reynolds' Weekly Newspaper, the Weekly Mail, and the Morning Advertiser. The master builders changed approach, asking workers to make a verbal declaration rather than sign the Document, but this too was unsuccessful. Harnott arrived in London in September, and attempted to persuade the master builders to drop their Document, in exchange for abandoning the nine-hours policy which he had never supported. Only one company agreed to this, and while work recommenced there, Harnott left the city in defeat. Potter, by November, was ready to follow Harnott's approach, formally calling off the strike at Trollope's, and dropping the nine-hours claim, but the master builders were hopeful of success in the winter months, when less building work could be conducted, and continued their lock out. By the end of the year, only the OSM had the funds to continue regular strike pay to its members, with the OBS managing some payments. A new Builders' Labourers' Union was founded, but had no funds to pay its striking members, and other striking workers were either unorganised, or members of very small, local unions. However, Potter was able to secure substantial donations from trade union organisations around the country, with the Amalgamated Society of Engineers leading the way by donating ¬£3,000 ().. As a result, although the labourers were defeated in December, the other unions remained solid. Outcome The master builders finally withdrew the Document on 7 February 1860. Although the unions had not advanced their position from the previous year, the experience led workers to form stronger, national unions in the unorganised trades: the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, National Association of Operative Plasterers, Amalgamated Society of House Decorators and Painters and United Operative Plumbers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland were all formed over the next few years, as were the London Trades Council and The Bee-Hive trades union newspaper.Henry Pelling, (1992) A History of British Trade Unionism References Category:Strikes (protest) Category:1859 in London Category:Events in London Category:Conflicts in 1859 Category:1859 labor disputes and strikes ","title":"London builders' strike (1859)"},{"id":"49401135","text":"The Early January 2014 nor'easter was a major winter storm that affected much of the East Coast with snow, and frigid temperatures following the storm. The storm had dumped up to of snow in some areas, especially around Boston, Massachusetts.  Meteorological synopsis  Late on December 30, a weak clipper system moved southward from Canada. The system produced light snow in the Midwest around areas like Minneapolis, Minnesota with only light accumulations. Starting on New Year's Day, however, the clipper began to strengthen and take an eastward turn. It would produce more moderate to heavy snow around areas like Cincinnati, Ohio, with accumulations of roughly 4-6 inches. The storm then continued to move eastwards towards the East Coast, where it would continue to intensify. Early on January 2, the system started to become more complex as a new low pressure area had formed in the Gulf of Mexico along a stationary front. Winter storm warnings began to be issued by roughly mid-day from eastern New England to as far west as Pennsylvania as the storm closed in on the Northeast. By 3:00 p.m, the northern low began to weaken as the southern one began to take over as it continued to pull moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This was the start of the storm's transition to a nor'easter. Later that night, the low pressure began to strengthen off the Southeast coast and move out to sea as it dumped snow on its northwestern side over the Northeastern United States and New England. Snow continued to fall into the early hours of January 3 even as it pulled away from the coastline. After it had left the coast early that morning, it continued to strengthen and turn to the northeast, and late on January 4, it reached its peak intensity of while situated near Greenland. It was then absorbed into another extratropical cyclone, which later developed into Cyclone Christina which brought high winds to western Europe several days later.  Aftermath and cold wave  Cyclone Christina (seen east of Newfoundland on January 4) later developed from the remnants of the nor'easter, bringing high winds and flooding to Western Europe. After the storm passed, an arctic front associated with it passed through the region, bringing record cold temperatures in the eastern half of the United States. On January 3, Boston had a temperature of with a wind chill, and over of snow. Boxford, Massachusetts recorded . Fort Wayne, Indiana had a record low of . In Michigan, over of snow fell outside Detroit and temperatures around the state were near or below . New Jersey had over of snow, and schools and government offices closed. Over a dozen deaths were attributed to the cold wave, with dangerous roadway conditions and extreme cold cited as causes. Evan Gold of weather intelligence firm Planalytics called the storm and the low temperatures the worst weather event for the economy since Hurricane Sandy just over a year earlier. 200 million people were affected, and Gold calculated the impact at $5 billion. $50 to $100 million was lost by airlines which cancelled a total of 20,000 flights after the storm began on January 2. JetBlue took a major hit because 80 percent of its flights go through New York City or Boston. Tony Madden of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said with so many schools closed, parents had to stay home from work or work from home. Even the ones who could work from home, Madden said, might not have done as much. Not included in the total were the insurance industry and government costs for salting roads, overtime and repairs.

Administrator of Aversa On 17 November 1254, Master Simone, Canon of Padua and Procurator of the Church of Aversa, was named Administrator of the Church of Aversa by Pope Innocent IV.E. Berger, Registres d' Innocent IV III (Paris 1897), p. 540 no. 8209. Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 8, believed that Magister Simone held the position of Administrator until he was named cardinal. He was already Procurator, which meant that the Church of Aversa had employed him to manage its business in the Roman Curia. The reason for Simone's appointment as Administrator of Aversa, a town just north of Naples, is not far to seek. Innocent IV, in his obsessive policy of destroying the Hohenstaufen, a policy inherited from his predecessor Gregory IX, had negotiated an understanding with Manfred, son of Frederick II \\"the Great\\", and brother of Conrad IV von Hohenstaufen. The apparent understanding was embodied in a treaty of September 1254, in which the Pope acquired possession of Apulia.Baronius-Theiner, under the year 1254, nos. 48-59, pp. 468-472; Capasso, no. 153, pp. 77-78. But Manfred's suspicions were justifiably aroused against the Pope and his advisers by their behavior as the Roman Curia was traveling from Anagni to Capua.Nicolaus de Jamsilla, in Ludovico Antonio Muratori Rerum Italicarum Scriptores VIII, pp. 527-532; Baronius-Theiner, under the year 1254, nos. 65-68, p. 473-474; Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Annali d'Italia 18, pp. 189-190; Capasso, pp. 72-73; Di Cesare, Storia di Manfredo, pp. 49-101. He had built a papal army, led by Cardinal Guglielmo Fieschi, his nephew, and began moving south against Manfred in October 1254. The papal army reached Teano on 16 October, causing Manfred to flee for his life.Capasso, no. 159, p. 79. During these two months, Innocent was eager to acquire as much local support as possible, including that of the barons of Aversa.On 31 October 1254, Innocent IV had confirmed Bartolommeo de Rebursa, a miles of Aversa, and his heirs in their castles and other holdings: Berger, Registres d' Innocent IV, p. 535 no. 8174. On 12 November 1534, Innocent confirmed Perono of Aversa in his castles, which he had once held in feudal tenure from the excommunicated Conrad IV: Berger, Registres d' Innocent IV p. 534, no. 8176. On 23 October 1254, for example, Innocent, who was at Capua at the time, detached Amalfi from their traditional obedience to the Kings of Sicily and received them directly into his own power. The papal army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Foggia, which took place on 2 December 1254, days before the death of Innocent himself, in Naples, on Monday 7 December. The new pope, Alexander IV, raised another army against Manfred, led by Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini as Legate in the Kingdom of Sicily. It is conjectured that Paltanieri was his Vicar. The second papal army was crushed by Manfred in 1257. Cardinal Simone Paltanieri was created cardinal priest by Pope Urban IV (Jacques Pantaleone) on 17 December 1261, and eventually assigned the titular Church of SS. Silvester and Martin in Rome.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), pp. 8 and 46. At the time of his creation he had not yet received sacramental ordination as a priest, and complaints were made to the Pope that he should not be allowed to function as a cardinal until that defect had been made good. Pope Urban agreed that he should not use cardinalatial insignia or participate in Consistory until he had been ordained.Potthast, no. 18211 (5 January 1262). Baronius-Theiner, Volume 22 (1870), under the year 1261 ¬ß 23, p. 73. Then charges were laid against Simone's character, which the Pope felt compelled to acknowledge for their seriousness, and an investigation was therefore ordered into their trustworthiness.Potthast, no. 18227 (7 February 1262). To be sure, the anonymous Monk of Padua gave Simone a rousing endorsement: \\"Lord Simone de Montescillice, Canon of Padua, is very blessed, as much as in the appearance of his body and the nobility of his ancestry as the gentility of his mores and his manyfold knowledge.\\"Annales S. Iustinae Patavini, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Tomus XIX (Hannover 1866), p. 181. But it was not until 26 June 1262, that Cardinal Simone subscribed his first papal document.Charles Piot, \\"Documents relatifs √† l' abbaye de Soli√®res,\\" Compte rendu des s√©ances, ou Recueil de ses bulletins. Acad√©mie royale de Belgique Cinqui√®me s√©rie, 4 (1894), pp. 33-34, no. 13. E. Jordan, p. 329 (based on Potthast, no. 18462) is out-of-date. As a cardinal, Paltanieri was a member of the Ghibbeline faction in the Sacred College.Dominique Raynaud, L'hypoth√®se d'Oxford: essai sur les origines de la perspective (Paris 1998), p. 207. Provincial governor On 20 May 1264, Cardinal Simone was appointed Rector of the Duchy of Spoleto, the Marches of Ancona and Massa Trabaria, Perugia, Civita Castellana, Tudertina, Narni, Interamna and Reate, as well as the Patriarchates of Aquileia, Gradensis and Ravenna by Pope Urban IV.C.

Cardinal Simone did not participate in the papal election of 8 October 1264 in Perugia,Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I, p. 8 n. 11, states that he did not participate. See the note of Giovanni Domenico Mansi in Baronius-Theiner 22, under the year 1265, Clementis IV anno 1, no. 1, p. 147; and Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), p. 1543. though he was surely present for the ratification of the election upon the arrival of the pope-elect, Guy Foulques, on 5 February 1265. Conclaves Cardinal Simone Paltanieri participated in the long Election of 1268-1271, and was one of the six cardinals elected on 1 September 1271, to a Committee of Compromise, charged with selecting a pope from inside or outside the College of Cardinals, provided that five of the six cardinals were in agreement.Francesco Cristofori, Le tombe dei papi in Viterbo (Siena 1887), pp. 208-209. Archdeacon Teobaldo Visconti of Li√®ge, a native of Piacenza and nephew of Otto Visconti, Archbishop of Milan, was chosen. Visconti's nephew, Vicedomino de' Vicedomini, a native of Piacenza, Archbishop of Aix, was a follower and advisor of the Angevin King Charles I of Naples, brother of Louis IX of France. In 1274 Cardinal Simone travelled to France and was present at the opening session of the Second Council of Lyon, under the presidency of Pope Gregory X.Isidorus Carini, \\"Brevis Historia Concilii Lugdunensis,\\" in Specilegio Vaticano di documenti inediti e rari estratti dagli Archivi e dalla Biblioteca della Sede Apostolica Volume I (Roma: Ermanno Loescher 1890), pp. 250-251. His return journey to Italy seems to have followed a different path from that of the Pope and six cardinals who accompanied him. Cardinal Simone was not present at Arezzo on 10 January 1276, when Pope Gregory X died without having completed his return journey to Rome. Cardinal Simone was present, however, in time to take part in the Conclave of 20‚Äì21 January 1276, which elected Cardinal Pierre de Tarantaise as Pope Innocent V on the first ballot.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante of January 1276. retrieved 02/12/2016. Cardinal Simone was also one of a dozen or thirteen cardinals who participated in the Second Conclave of 1276, which began on 2 July, and resulted in the election of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi of Genoa on 11 July.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Conclave of July, 1276. retrieved 02/13/1216. Cardinal Ottobono took the name Adrian V, and in his first Consistory, the day of or the day after his election, he suspended the papal Bull, \\"Ubi Periculum\\" of Pope Gregory X, which governed the operation of papal conclaves. He and the Papal Curia then immediately left Rome to get away from the summer heat. Unfortunately Adrian died in Viterbo only thirty-eight days into his reign, never having been ordained priest, consecrated bishop, or crowned Pope. The Conclave to elect a successor to Pope Adrian should have begun on 28 or 29 August but the rules that dictated such a date (\\"Ubi Periculum\\") had been suspended. In any case, it is known that disorders in the city of Viterbo, caused by members of the Roman Curia and the People, brought about a delay. Ten cardinals selected one of their body, Cardinal Peter Juliani of Lisbon, as the new pope. He chose to call himself John XXI (the credulous inclusion of 'Pope Joan' in the papal numbering confused the correct enumeration; Peter was only the 20th Pope John), and was crowned at Viterbo on 20 September 1276 by Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini.John P.

It was the first LGBT film festival to be established in mainland China, founded in 2001 by the Chinese author and LGBT film director Cui Zi'en, a professor at the Beijing Film Academy. Other Chinese-language LGBT film festivals in the region, which also feature international LGBT films with Chinese subtitles, include CINEMQ, Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival and Taiwan International Queer Film Festival. Like the Beijing Queer Film Festival, Shanghai Queer Film Festival, is a volunteer-run, not-for- profit event, and aims to help facilitate and promote the work of filmmakers from Chinese and other Asian backgrounds. Beijing has a large LGBT community. The Festival originated from Peking University, and is considered to be \\"the only community-based non-governmental film festival in China with a special focus on gender and sexuality\\". In 2011, Chinese filmmaker Yang Yang made a documentary entitled Our Story: The Beijing Queer Film Festival‚Äôs 10 Years of ‚ÄúGuerrilla Warfare‚Äù (ÊàëÂÄëÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ãÔºöÂåó‰∫¨ÈÖ∑ÂÖíÂΩ±Â±ïÂçÅÂπ¥Ê∏∏ÊìäÊà∞), reporting on the struggles of the Festival and the team behind it, and examining the role of the Chinese government's media censorship. Background The screening of LGBT films presents a challenge to filmmakers and festival organizers in China, as the country has a censorship law that prohibits any positive depiction of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender lives in films or TV shows. The selection of mainstream venues is not permitted, and the big international festivals in Shanghai and Beijing do not show gay-themed films, whilst DVDs of films such as Brokeback Mountain are only available on the black market. The founder of the Beijing Queer Film Festival, Cui Zi'en, says \\"The biggest change is that I'm not the only one doing this... There's more support from the gay community. Society has become more relaxed and open-minded in its thinking\\". Community organizers say that gay-themed events that would have been banned a few years ago are now being permitted. History Beijing Queer Film Festival was founded in 2001 by Chinese film director Cui Zi‚Äôen, who personally identifies as gay. During the Festival's early years, screenings were often cancelled at short notice by the security police, and films were moved from cinemas and universities to bars and private homes. Publicity was largely by word-of-mouth and the organizers were notified that they may be arrested. The Festival was closed by the police in 2001 and 2005, and the Festival's main venues were changed or cancelled. The second edition, in 2002, relocated its screenings from Beijing University to the-then semi-'underground' 798 arts district, (in Dashanzi, north east of Beijing city centre), which is described as \\"China's version of New York's SoHo\\". In 2011, the Festival was again ordered shut down by government officials. In 2013, the Festival proceeded without interruption. Organizers did no public advertising for the event, and many screening venues were announced at the last minute. Several more publicized screenings were held at the French and Dutch embassies, and the American Center, out of reach of the local authorities. In that year, 28 films from nine countries were screened, including Chinese-language titles from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The Festival also hosted a debate on the topic of film censorship in China. Due to the perceived success of the Festival in 2013, the organizers for the 2014 edition decided to hold the screenings in a public cinema and marketed the Festival to the Beijing LGBT community through social media. However, during this period, the Chinese Government, under the country's new leadership, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, arrested critics and closed down NGOs that were regarded as potentially critical of the government. In late August 2013, the Beijing Independent Film Festival had been forced to close, and would-be audience members were dispersed by police, whilst the venue's electricity supply was switched off and the organizers were detained. During this time, police seized documents and film archives from their offices. As a result of these developments, the 2014 Festival organizers decided to change their approach, and abandoned the idea of using a public cinema, and decided to cut back on their social media activities. Shortly before the festival began, two security officers visited the Festival Co-director, Jenny Man Wu, a non-LGBT woman with a long-term interest in LGBT cinema. They told her that they had tapped her phone and read all her emails, and that, if she went ahead with the Festival as planned, \\"there will be trouble.‚Äù On the day before the opening of the 2014 Festival, an email was sent to potential attendees that there was a new plan. They were told to \\"go to the central Beijing railway station the next morning, purchase tickets for the 11:15 AM train to a town near the Great Wall, and proceed to car [carriage] number 7\\", with the note ending ‚ÄúMake sure to bring your laptops‚Äù. The following morning, the train carriage was filled with a mixture of Chinese LGBT film buffs, filmmakers, academics, artists and activists. The organizers handed out flash drives for the laptops, containing the opening film, Our Story, a retrospective of the Festival's history. The rest of the festival went off without major incident. Most of the films were from China, with others from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Europe.

Early life  Little was born and grew up on a tobacco farm in Pactolus Township, North Carolina. He carried vibrant childhood memories of life around his parents' grocery store into his artwork. He graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Communications. Little then lived in Charlotte, N.C., for 18 years. After a 2002 residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts in California, he moved to the San Francisco area where he still lives.  Career  After college, Little received a series of three grants that allowed him to create a nearly life-size multimedia installation in 1995 that depicts the store and bar titled Juke Joint. Little recreated bar patrons using mannequins sculpted over with paper, clay, peat moss and acrylic paint. He also developed an accompanying audio narrative that was played on a jukebox in the exhibit based on recollected banter from the cast of characters who patronized the bar and music from the late '60s . \\"I witnessed dancing and romancing to the soulful sounds of Clarence Carter, Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklinpickled eggs and pickled pig's feet, along with a quick 50 cent shot of gin in a Dixie paper cup,\\" Little said. Juke Joint also traveled to other cities including to the African-American Museum in Dallas. Samella S. Lewis in her book _African American Art and Artists_ wrote, \\"Juke Joint is a portal through time to a vanished way of life.\\" Establishments like Little's family grocery were a common feature in communities in the South. His parents' store closed in 1980. A smaller version of Juke Joint first opened in 1994 at the Afro-American Cultural Center in Charlotte, N.C. Little then incorporated the original installation and took it to a larger scale. In 2003, the Juke Joint exhibit was on display at the Smithsonian Institution Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C. and is part of the Smithsonian's permanent collection. At the installation's opening Washington Post Art Critic Paul Richard comment that all the authentic details and design rendered the installation lyrical. \\"'Juke Joint' is like three-dimensional blues, but a grateful blues.\\" Little's work is often driven by political and social commentary. During a printmaking residency at Caversham Press in Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa in 2000, Little created a series he called \\"Baggage,\\" reflecting what he described in an interview as America's baggage: self-righteousness and use of the Bible to justify bigotry. Race and a black-and-white divide are central to some of his works. In 2008, he created an exhibit and show titled In Mixed Company at the Levine Museum of the New South in Charlotte, N.C. The installation is a small room filled with artifacts and memorabilia from white and black worlds with a wall of stinging nettles separating them. Little carefully selected each of the hundreds of eclectic objects he used for its symbolism. In Mixed Company includes an old tin of Premium Crackers, emphasizing the word Crackers, a derogatory term for rural white people; a gilded gold leaf box lined with confederate 20 dollar bills; and carved African walking sticks. Little as the storyteller was part of the show, engaging museum patrons with stories from his childhood, including a tale told by an elderly African American neighbor about \\"the curse\\" of nappy hair. In 2010 with a grant from the prestigious Pollock-Krasner Foundation, Little began to create artistic commentary on racism in the Tea Party movement. In the variety of medium in which he works, sculpting, painting, and multimedia creations, he linked the new Tea Party to what he believes is a modern Ku Klux Klan. For a 2014 exhibit In the Hood at the New Gallery of Modern Art in Charlotte, N.C., he created a 20-foot-tall, walk-in Ku Klux Klan hood. Inside the giant hood was a life-size sculpture of an enslaved South African woman, Sarah Baartman, who'd been forced to appear in London freak shows to display her exceptionally large buttocks. Little made her skirt from 1,000 hand-dipped black teabags. In the Hood also features artifacts of racism surrounded by symbols of hip-hop music, which Little said is a way of linking and antagonizing the KKK with the culture it hates. Little works in many media, including abstract rust painting, also called oxidation painting, where mediums such as acid and water are applied to a base of such as metal, paper or fabric. Among his rust paintings is a series titled Blue Moon. In a magazine interview, Little said the red rust is reminiscent of North Carolina's red clay soil and rusty tin roofs, and the cerulean blue that appears among abstract forms, its sky. A life-threatening illness in 2013, propelled Little's work in oxidation painting. \\"During my recovery, these multimedia paintings ‚Äî beginning with Blood Orange ‚Äî metaphorically reflected my intense anger, rage, passion and desire to dig myself out from near death with a resilience and determination to gouge and scrape away from the surface ‚Äî the dark disparity ‚Äî into the light of life, survival to thrive, give thanks and have gratitude to be alive.\\" Little's work is included in the prestigious John and Vivian Hewitt Collection of African-American Art. Charlotte's public radio station WFAE mentioned him in an article about artist Heather Hart's project to include more African American artists in Wikipedia. In June 2016, Little returned to the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, N.C., for an exhibit titled \\"prompt\\" created by three alumni artists-in-residence. Little was a resident artist at McColl in 1999. The alumni were given four weeks to create individual installations based on three prompts: the words \\"divisions and differences\\" must be a catalyst, the artists must use a material, process or approach new to him or her, and it must have an interactive element with viewers. Little's mixed media installation \\"American Obsession\\" (shown in this wiki page profile in the upper right corner) examines gun violence, race, and standards of beauty, according to a statement by the artist which accompanied the work. \\"Lips and backsides, dating back to the Hottentot Venus in the 1800s, once ridiculed and mocked, are now a premium to achieve, speaking to the influence of Black Culture on the world,\\" Little wrote. \\"Chains, like the one attached to the figure you see here, symbolize enslavement and restriction. Sometimes being constricted can force creative resilience.\\" Gallery guests were invited to engage with the installation by repositioning a toy AK-47 to suggest whether the beautiful woman in the painting is a victim, victor or neither. He tapped into an American obsession with selfies by encouraging viewers to take selfies with the installation and post them at #AmericanObsession.

Breckon started his career under the mentorship of H.E Gaze in 1904 and was eventually appointed the position of Chief Photographer for The Weekly News and The New Zealand Herald for over twenty years. Breckon's press photography captured the conflict and tension present in early 20th century New Zealand. Most notably, Breckon captured the police attack on Maungapohatu in April 1916. This event resulted in Rua Kenana and some of his followers made to stand trial for sedition. He was the only photographer present at the time. Another important moment that Breckon captured in photographs was the expedition of Douglas Mawson to the sub Antarctic Macquarie Islands. The crew were running low on food supplies so a rescue mission was despatched. This mission, which Breckon was a part of, ran into trouble of its own when their landing boat capsized in the surf. Breckon and the team struggled to shore in the icy cold water to eventually make their way to Mawson's men. Breckon photos captured much of the wildlife on the islands. Other honourable mentions in Breckon's work was his photographs of the wreckage site of the SS Wiltshire off Great Barrier in 1922 and pictures of the Napier earthquake. Breckon had also photographed both the First and Second New Zealand Expeditionary Forces before their deployment to war.

It was built in the Byzantine Revival style and is a Grade II* listed building. History =Foundation= From 1824, a Catholic priest resided in Rochdale. He was Fr William Turner, who later became Bishop of Salford. Originally, Mass was said in a room of a warehouse on Clegg Street. In 1829, St John's Church church was built and opened on Ann Street in Rochdale. Fr Turner was priest until 1835, when he became the priest at St Chad's Church in Cheetham Hill. He was replaced by a Fr Dowling. In 1860, this church was replaced by one made of brick. In 1871, Fr Dowling died and was replaced by a dean, Fr O'Neill.Henry Fishwick, The History of the Parish of Rochdale in the County of Lancaster (Rochdale: J. Clegg, 1889), 269.

He is noted for establishing the university's Albany campus near Auckland in 1993. Early life, family, and education Born in New Plymouth on 10 April 1931, Waters was the son of Kathleen Emily Waters (n√©e Morris) and Edwin Benjamin Waters. He was educated at New Plymouth Boys' High School, and went on to study chemistry at Auckland University College, graduating Bachelor of Science in 1953, Master of Science with second-class honours the following year, and PhD in 1958. His doctoral thesis, supervised by David Hall, was titled The colour isomerism and structure of some copper co‚Äëordination compounds. In 1959, Waters married crystallographer Joyce Mary Partridge. Academic career Waters was appointed as a lecturer in chemistry at Auckland in 1961, rising to the rank of full professor in 1970. In 1969, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Auckland on the basis of published papers submitted. Waters served as assistant vice chancellor of the University of Auckland between 1979 and 1981, including a period in 1980 as acting vice chancellor. He left Auckland at the end of 1982, and was accorded the title of professor emeritus by the university in 1984. In 1983, Waters was appointed as principal and vice chancellor of Massey University, serving in that role until 1995. In 1995, Massey also bestowed the title of professor emeritus on Waters. During his career, Waters served on a range of university, science sector, and government bodies, including: the council of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science from 1977 to 1979; the board of the New Zealand University Grants Committee in 1982; the New Zealand Vice Chancellors' Committee from 1983 to 1995, including periods as chair in 1984‚Äì85 and 1994; the council of Palmerston North College of Education from 1983 to 1988, the council of Manawatu Polytechnic from 1983 to 1990, as chair of the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology between 1995 and 1998; and chair of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority from 1995 to 1999. Later life and death From 1997, Waters was an honorary senior research fellow at Massey University's Albany campus, where his wife Joyce was a professor of chemistry. In 2002, Massey University's governing council considered restoring Waters to the vice-chancellorship as an interim replacement following the retirement of his successor, James McWha; however, the board was prevented from doing so by the State Sector Act 1988, which barred the appointment of someone not already on the university's payroll; Waters had since moved to Auckland and no longer worked in the university sector. Waters died in Auckland on 7 June 2018, aged 87. Honours and awards In 1990, Waters was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1995 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to tertiary education. Waters was conferred with honorary Doctor of Science degrees by the University of East Asia in 1986, and Massey University in 1996. He was elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry in 1977, Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in 1979, and Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1992.

History Montalv√£o was an important settlement in the Alto Alentejo during the first years of the Portuguese monarchy. The need to protect its frontier required that a populational presence was needed to mark the territory, and project a Christian control of the region. The locale, therefore, was under the control of the Command of the Order of Christ, and which originated the castle. Its construction occurred during the reign of King D. Dinis, but there is evidence that the zone may have had a human presence prior to its formal occupation. The early medieval fortress was not likely a large project, but a simple plan of necessity carried out during the 16th century. In the 12th century, there already existed defensive structures, which were part of the famous Tagus Line of defenses. Between 1279 and 1325, the castle was constructed or reconstructed, during the reign of King D. Dinis. Around 1509, Duarte d' Armas sketched the layout of the fortification, highlighting a long curtain of walls, without any tower, and accessible by a single gate. On 22 November 1512, a foral (charter) was issued by King D. Manuel I. During the 17th century, the main accessway was reconstructed, and in 1640, during the sequence of the Independence War, the castle fell along the main defensive line. It obtained its classical look, with rectangular lintel between pilasters supporting an architrave. In 1834, the municipality of Montalv√£o was extinguished. On 1 June 2012, the fortification was included in its respective Special Protection Zone (in announcement 12 203/2012, Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie II, 107), classifying the structure as a Monumento de Interesse P√∫blico (Monument of Public Interest). Architecture The castle is situated in an isolated urban area, on top of a hill, near the Church of Montalv√£o. Its enclosure is dominated by an enormous concrete tower/bunker used for the collection of water. There are vestiges of the wall foundations, towers and cisterns of the medieval castle, survived by some walls, composed of shale. The interior of the fortification is marked by a rectangular, sepulchral ark of stone with one of the faces sculpted with vegetal elements and the cross of Christ in its centre.

It is classified by IGESPAR as a Site of Public Interest. Built on an escarpment, the castle dominates the village on the left bank of Abrilongo riverside, near its confluence with the X√©vora river. Rebuilt by King Dinis (1279-1325), the castle received bulwark walls during the reign of King John IV (1640-1656). Its walls resembled the Spanish fortification of Alburquerque. It currently is a member of the Tourism-Promotion Plains Area.  History  = Early history = The early occupation of its site dates back to pre-Roman fort. At the time of the Roman invasion and occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, the town was designated under the name Budua. During its occupation by the Visigoths, they called it Niguela. From the eighth century Umuyyad Muslims had the town fortified. = Medieval castle = At the time of the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula, reconquest of the village and its surrounding land was finally achieved 1230, by Castilian and Leonese forces. Years later, May 28, 1255, the good-men of Badajoz county donated Ouguela and elsewhere to the Bishop of Badajoz. By the Treaty of Alca√±ices on 12 September, 1297, the domains of Ouguela and its castle transferred to the Crown of Portugal. The following year, King Dinis (1279-1325) in Lisbon on January 5, 1298, aimed at increasing Ouguela's settlement and defense, granted the town a charter with many privileges, with a focus on its defense. During the reign of Ferdinand starts the construction of the new fence of the village, works that continue under the reign of King John I (1385-1433). The latter, also with a view to its settlement and defense, granted the village the Couto privilege homiziados (7 December 1420). = War of Independence to modern day = During the war for the Restoration of Portuguese independence, the advisers to John IV (1640-1656) determined that there is a need to modernize their defenses, which won bulwark lines project in charge of the French architect Nicolau de Langres. It is from this period that the episode immortalized his defense when the Alentejo invasion by a force of 1,500 riders and 1,000 infants Spaniards coming from Badajoz under the Marquis command Torrecusa in 1644. For the achievement of Ouguela offered one traitor, Jo√£o Rodrigues de Oliveira, who worked with the Spanish. During the eighteenth century, records indicate a construction started to build a bulwark, a half- bastion and a ravelin after the earthquake o 1755. With the defense thus strengthened, the garrison under the command of cavalry captain Br√°s de Carvalho the Spanish invasion of 1762. Legal papers dating from the period between 1755 and 1803 shows the defenses consisted of a watchman, ditches and cuttings. On that date, were built under the Marquis of command de la Reine, the Sergeant Major of Engineers Maximiano Jose Serra, the scopes of Cabe√ßo da Forca and Martyr. Although there have been designed to recover one of the towers south of the castle (1828) and the construction of a crescent to the east Access Protection (1829), the square was demilitarized in 1840. Subsequently, the West sector, defined by bulwark structures, it became a cemetery of the village. The property was classified as Property of Public Interest by decree published on August 18, 1943.

History  Between the Roman and Muslim occupations there existed a castle fortification by the name of Arminho on the site. The medieval settlement was founded on a Romanized castro, which was a 2nd century presence conditioned by its position over the Ribeira de Seda, identifiable by milestone encountered in the region, among other vestiges. In 1160, D. Afonso Henriques conquered the settlement from the Moors. The construction of the walls likely began following its conquest, along a frontier which was still influenced skirmishes and battles. Following their defeat, the location was donated to the Knights Templar, but in 1271, Seda was transferred to the Knights of Avis; Friar Sim√£o Soeiro, Master of the Order, received a new foral for its development. On 18 May 1271, a foral (charter) was conceded to Father Sim√£o, Master of Avis, which was later (30 October 1427) validated by King D. John I and reissued on 1 September 1510, by King D. Manuel I. In the 1527 \\"Numeramento\\", it was the seat of the municipality, during the jurisdiction of the Order of Avis, when there were 184 residents. The municipality was extinguished in 1836, with the administrative reforms. In 1970, there was a collapse of part of the walls and corbel of the fortification. As a result, in 1971, the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) began the consolidation of the walls and tower. But, urgent repairs were made in 1978, that included patching of the masonry. To protect the castle from complete ruin, the government classified the castle as a Property of Public Interest by decree on 26 February 1982. Architecture The castle is located in a rural area, delimited in the east and north by primitive houses. The walls and corbels are situated between the vegetable gardens and yards of the Rua do Castelo, while along the east is a abrupt slope, that is part of a derelict farm. Of the castle, there remains the embattlement walls with three corbels and vestiges of a fourth. The entire structure is based on an irregular plan.

When Victoire de Rohan was to be replaced as Governess of the Children of France in 1782, de Duras, alongside Laure-Auguste de Fitz-James, Princess de Chimay, was commonly assumed to be the two most suitable candidates for the post: however, Marie Antoinette refused de Chimay because of her too severe religiosity and de Duras because she reportedly felt a certain academic inferiority toward her, and chose Yolande de Polastron for the position instead.Madame Campan, Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France Reportedly, Marie Antoinette felt a certain inferiority toward Louise-Charlotte de Duras because of de Duras' greater learning and scholarly knowledge, and was therefore somewhat uncomfortable in her presence. Their relationship was therefore more professional than friendly. However, the queen also felt respect for her, and it was therefore often de Duras who was selected to correct the queen whenever she made a mistake, such as when Marie Antoinette wished to visit the theater just one day after the death of her close friend Th√©r√®se-Lucy de Dillon, which gave her much bad publicity. During the visit of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in France in 1777, Marie Antoinette often selected de Duras to accompany her during his visits, because she expected the intellectual de Duras to make a more favorable impression upon Joseph than her more intimate friends among her courtiers, whom Joseph had been given harsh criticism. =French Revolution= Louise-Charlotte de Duras remained in service at court after the outbreak of the French revolution, and the removal of the court from Versailles to Paris after the Women's March on Versailles. She resigned in 1791, along with a number of other members of the royal household, after the Flight to Varennes, when the government issued reforms in the household of the king which abolished several old court customs and privileges of etiquette, such as the tabouret. Her spouse and her son both emigrated, her husband being a part of the Arm√©e des √âmigr√©s. She retired with her parents retired to their Chateau Mouchy-le-Ch√¢tel in Oise in September 1792.Louise Henriette Charlotte Philippine (de Noailles) de Durfort, duchesse de Duras, Prison Journals During the French Revolution, New York, 1892 On 25 August 1793, they were placed in house arrest on their estate in accordance with the decree of potential enemies of the state. On 6 October, Louise- Charlotte de Duras was transferred to Beauvais and from there Chantilly, while her parents where transferred to La Force Prison in Paris ten days later. Her parents, sister-in-law Louise de Noailles, as well as her aunt Catherine de Coss√©-Brissac and cousin Henriette Anne Louise d'Aguesseau where all executed June-July 1794. She herself remained in prison and was liberated after the fall of Robespierre, settling with her mother-in-law, Louise Fran√ßoise de Co√´tquen (1724-1802). Louise-Charlotte de Duras' memoirs, depicting her life during the French revolution, have been published.

Battey Cornelius Marion Battey (August 26, 1873 ‚Äì March 14, 1927) was an American photographer who shot photographic portraits of black Americans in a pictorialist style. His photograph of black leaders appeared on the cover of the NAACP's magazine The Crisis beginning in the 1910s. He later founded and headed up the photography department at the Tuskegee Institute. W.E.B. Du Bois, photographed in 1918 by C.M. Battey. Cover photo for 1920 issue of The Crisis, shot by C.M. Battey. Early years Cornelius Marion Battey was born on August 26, 1873 in Augusta, Georgia, but was raised in the North. His first job in photography was in a studio in Cleveland, Ohio. He moved to Manhattan, New York City and worked for six years in the Bradley Photographic Studio on Fifth Avenue, where he held the position of superintendent. He went on to work at Underwood & Underwood, one of the city's successful early 20th century photo studios, where he headed up the retouching department. Battey and Warren Studio Battey eventually opened a business on Mott Street in New York with a white partner under the name Battey and Warren Studio. He shot idealized photographic portraits of black people, some famous and some not. One of his earliest known photographs is of Frederick Douglass, shot in 1893 just two years before Douglass's death. His style was pictorialist, characterized by use of soft focus and retouching of the negatives and prints to smooth out any irregularities. Battey became a friend of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was then editing The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Battey's portraits of America's black leaders began regularly appearing on the cover of The Crisis. He also shot covers for The Messenger magazine and the journal Opportunity. As his fame grew, he also photographed white leaders such as President Calvin Coolidge and United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Starting around 1900, Battey began extensively documenting the life of Booker T. Washington, continuing until Washington's death in 1915. Along with Arthur P. Bedou, he was one of the two photographers Washington most relied on, especially during northern trips. Battey's formal, quiet studio portraits complemented Bedou's more journalistic, snapshot style. Tuskegee Institute In 1916, Battey replaced Bedou as the official photographer of the Tuskegee Institute (of which Washington had been the founding principal). The administration favored him in part because it wanted to set up a photography department and Battey had connections with Eastman Kodak whose founder, George Eastman, had been a longtime supporter of the school. Eastman donated funds to found the new department, which Battey then headed up until his death a decade later. Battey taught courses in photography and at the same time documented the campus and its students and faculty, creating a unique record of black college life in the early twentieth century. Among those he mentored was photographer P. H. Polk. During his years at Tuskegee, Battey published a special edition of a print that visually linked four famous African-Americans with George Washington as a way of reclaiming black Americans' place in history. Originally entitled Five Negro Immortals, the photogravure was published in 1911 as Our Heroes of Destiny and included Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Battey lost a substantial amount of money on the costly project, even though he also sold inexpensive versions of the print as well as marketing the individual portraits as frameable prints and postcards. In 1921, when the New York Public Library's 135th St. branch in Harlem held its first exhibition of work by black artists, \\"The Negro Artists\\", Battey was one of two photographers to have work in the show (the other being Lucy Calloway). Death Battey died at Tuskegee, Alabama on March 14, 1927 in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Augusta, Georgia. His wife, with whom he had three children, had died earlier, in 1912. Legacy After Battey died, his negatives were packed up and put in storage under conditions that eventually destroyed them. As a result, Tuskegee Institute has only a few surviving prints from Battey's years of documentary work. In 1989, Battey's work was included in the exhibition \\"Black Photographers Bear Witness: 100 Years of Social Protest\\" at the Williams College Museum of Art.

Zakka worked as an Internet freedom advocate and served as secretary general of the Arab Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Organization (IJMA3) in Washington, D.C., and is a US permanent resident. On September 8, 2018, the person who had invited Nizar to visit Iran, Shahindokht Molaverdi, the top aide for citizenship rights to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, told the Associated Press that the Iranian government had not approved Nizar's imprisonment, and that \\"[w]e did all we could to stop this from happening, but we are seeing that we have failed to make a significant impact.\\" She blamed a \\"complete miscoordination\\" between Iran's civilian government and its independent judiciary, adding that \\"actions by one branch can ignore or neutralize efforts by another branch\\". Despite the admission Iran was holding him against his will, Zakka remained a hostage in Iran until June 2019. With the sponsorship of his home country president, General Michel Aoun, Zakka was released from Iran on June 11, 2019, and flew straight to Beirut. Early life and education Nizar Zakka was born in Lebanon, and holds permanent-resident status in the U.S. He attended the Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia, for high school, graduating in 1985. He attended the University of Texas, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and mathematics in 1989 and a Master of Science in computer science in 1991. Arrest in Iran Zakka traveled to Tehran on September 15, 2015 to participate in a conference on entrepreneurship, at the invitation of the Iranian government. On September 18, he disappeared while on the way to the airport to leave the country. On October 31, 2015, the Beirut-based Daily Star reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) was holding Zakka. On November 3, 2015, in the first official confirmation of his arrest, Iranian state broadcaster IRIB said Zakka was in the custody of authorities on suspicion of being an American spy. IRIB described him as a \\"treasure trove\\" because of \\"connections with intelligence and military bodies in the United States\\". As evidence, Iranian state TV displayed a photo of Zikka in army- style fatigues, which Zakka's family identified from a homecoming parade he participated in as an alumnus of his military high school in Georgia. Prior to his arrest in Iran, he was living in Washington, D.C., where he served as the secretary general of the Arab ICT Organization, known as IJMA3. Zakka‚Äôs family said they were \\"shocked by these false accusations\\" and stressed that he had no \\"relation with any military, security institution or secret services whatsoever\\".  Support for Nizar's release  On January 9, 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran, Ms. Asma Jahangir, raised alarm over the critical health situation of several prisoners of conscience, including Zakka, on prolonged hunger strike in the country. The United States Congress approved two resolutions, H.Res.317 and S.Res.245, that mentioned Zakka and other U.S. persons unlawfully detained in Iran. The Congress urged President Trump to \\"take whatever steps are in the national interest to secure the release of such individuals. Lawmakers also stressed the need to \\"make the release of U.S. citizens and legal permanent resident aliens held hostage by the Iranian government the highest of priorities.\\" Zakka is one of a number of dual citizens and foreign nationals detained in Iran in recent years, mostly on accusation of spying, including several Americans: Karan Vafadari and Afarin Neyssari, a Zoroastrian couple who were sentenced to 15 and 10 years in prison in 2018; Xiyue Wang, a doctoral student conducting historical research who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2017; Baquer Namazi and Siamak Namazi, a former UN official and his son who were both sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016; and Morad Tahbaz, an environmental activist who was arrested in 2018. The U.S. holds some Iranians for allegedly violating sanctions. In April 2019, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested negotiating a prisoner exchange with the U.S. Release Zakka was released by the Iranian government on 11 June 2019, following a request by Lebanon's President Michel Aoun and Lebanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil.

He was likely an ethnic Shatuo. Emperor Renzong of Song's first wife Empress Guo was his granddaughter. Early life Guo Chongwei was from Ying Prefecture, where his father and grandfather had both been tribal chieftains. Around age 20, Guo Chongwei enlisted in the Later Tang army. In 936, Shi Jingtang founded the Later Jin after overthrowing the Later Tang. In return for military support he received, he yielded the Sixteen Prefectures, including Ying Prefecture, to the northern Khitan state. Unwilling to serve the Khitans, Guo‚Äîwho was the commander-in-chief of the Ying Prefecture cavalry‚Äîleft his hometown and moved south to Later Jin territory in 937. In the ensuing years, he successively served as the cavalry commander-in- chief of three prefectures, Yun Prefecture, Hezhong Prefecture, and Lu Prefecture. In the mid-940s, Guo was stationed in Taiyuan Prefecture. During Later Han In January 947, the Khitans (Liao dynasty) destroyed the Later Jin, but their rule in the conquered territory proved short-lived. In March 947, Liu Zhiyuan, the military governor of Hedong Circuit based in Taiyuan, declared himself emperor. The Later Han army moved south to the Chinese heartland, and Guo Chongwei was one of the vanguard generals. In January 948, Guo was part of the army that escorted Liu Zhiyuan into Daliang. He was subsequently appointed prefect of Ying Prefecture, and later prefect of Fu Prefecture. In 949, Guo Chongwei followed general Guo Wei to quash Li Shouzhen's rebellion in Hezhong Prefecture. He received honorary titles for his military merits. Afterwards, Guo Wei became the military commissioner of Tianxiong Prefecture, and Guo Chongwei followed him to Ye, where he was made the chief military inspector-commissioner of Tianxiong Prefecture, in charge of the Mobile Brigade Cavalry. In December 950, Guo Chongwei received a secret imperial order from the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou, instructing him and others to murder Guo Wei and Wang Jun. This edict arrived just as Guo Wei and Wang Jun's families were all massacred in the capital, along with other ministers victimized by Liu Chengyou's purge. Informed by the plot, Guo Wei calmly summoned Guo Chongwei and others to follow the emperor's wish and kill him. Greatly moved, Guo Chongwei replied: :\\"The emperor is young and this decision is obviously made by petty courtiers close to him. If we grant the wishes of those people, how could there be peace in this country!\\" He and others urged Guo Wei to go to the capital to \\"weed out the rats and cleanse the imperial court\\". Guo Wei agreed and asked Guo Chongwei to head off with the cavalry as the vanguard unit, while his main army followed. On December 31, 950, Guo Wei's forces met the loyalist army, commanded by Murong Yanchao, right outside of Daliang. The next day, Guo Chongwei and the cavalry thoroughly routed Murong Yanchao's cavalry, and Liu Chengyou was killed the next night in his panicky flight. After entering the capital, Guo Chongwei and Wang Yin advised Guo Wei to take immediate measures to stop soldiers from looting and pillaging. On January 4, 951, Guo Wei decided that Liu Chengyou's cousin Liu Yun should arrive in Daliang to be the next emperor, so he sent out Feng Dao and others to Xu Prefecture to escort Liu Yun back to the capital. However, history quickly unfolded in a different direction. On January 9, 951, the imperial court received reports that the Khitans had attacked and taken a few northern border towns. Empress Dowager Li, the nominal regent, sent Guo Wei to take his army north to resist the Khitan invasion. Guo Wei's army reached Chan Prefecture on January 29. The next morning, thousands of his soldiers‚Äîfearful that they would be punished for having sacked the capital if another Liu became emperor‚Äîmade a commotion, supporting Guo Wei as emperor. Guo Wei accepted, and the army turned back to Daliang. Once news of the mutiny reached Daliang, Wang Jun and Wang Yin immediately sent Guo Chongwei‚Äîwho had been put in charge of the Metropolitan Cavalry Command‚Äîeastbound with 700 cavalries to intercept Liu Yun's entourage. Guo Chongwei quickly arrived outside Song Prefecture, where Liu Yun was resting. Frightened, Liu Yun climbed the city walls and asked Guo Chongwei why he arrived. Guo Chongwei assured Liu that he was only sent to protect him. Liu Yun asked him to enter the city, but Guo Chongwei did not dare. Only after Feng Dao exited and spoke with him did he enter, where he met with a teary-eyed Liu Yun who nervously gripped his hands. Guo Chongwei reassured him that Guo Wei only had good intentions. After Guo Chongwei exited the city, Dong Yi (Ëë£Ë£î), a loyal adviser, immediately said to Liu Yun: :\\"Notice how Chongwei looked and behaved! This must be a conspiracy. Everybody on the street is saying that Guo Wei has already declared himself emperor, if your majesty does not act soon, it will be a disaster!\\" Dong Yi asked Liu Yun to quickly summon Zhang Lingchao (Âºµ‰ª§Ë∂Ö), the commander of the army sent to protect him, and persuade him to attack Guo Chongwei's cavalry at night. But Liu Yun was too hesitant to do anything. Meanwhile, Guo Chongwei was secretly communicating with Zhang Lingchao, and succeeded in persuading Zhang to turn over his soldiers. Once he took control of the situation, Guo Chongwei summoned Feng Dao back to the capital, killed Dong Yi and other advisers loyal to Liu Yun while putting Liu Yun under house arrest. (Liu Yun was later killed.) During Later Zhou After Guo Wei established the Later Zhou, Guo Chongwei changed his name to Guo Chong to observe naming taboo. During the Song dynasty In 960, general Zhao Kuangyin usurped the imperial power from the 5-year-old Guo Zongxun to found the Song dynasty. Guo Chong was appointed secretariat director (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§). It was said that Guo Chong cried several times over the sad fate of the Later Zhou imperial house. Army-supervising commissioner Chen Sihui (Èô≥ÊÄùË™®) then sent a secret memorial to Zhao Kuangyin, reporting Guo Chong's outbursts and warning Zhao Kuangyin against a possible Guo Chong rebellion, as Changshan was close to the Song‚ÄìLiao border. Zhao Kuangyin knew Guo Chong well and completely understood his affection for the diseased Later Zhou emperors, still, he sent someone to watch Guo Chong's activities. The messenger returned to report that Guo Chong spent his days drinking and playing chess with his retinues in a pavilion by the pond, and his domain was peaceful. Zhao Kuangyin smiled and said, \\"Just as I predicted\\". Afterwards, Guo Chong came to Daliang (now known as Kaifeng Prefecture) to pay the emperor homage. After Li Chongjin rebelled and died, Guo Chong took over his titles. He died in 965, and Zhao Kuangyin posthumously honored him a grand perceptor.

As a royal ƒçelnik, the title-holder had a very high position at the Serbian court, often compared to comes palatinus. The veliki ƒçelnik supervised over several ƒçelniks, the ƒçelnik being a commander of military fortifications (and presumably its troops) or a senior (stare≈°ina) of a larger number of villages. Dimitrije entered the service of Stefan Du≈°an before 1349, when he was mentioned with the title of veliki ƒçelnik. Earlier, magnate Jovan Oliver had the title ( 1340). Dimitrije died on 6 March 1349 and was buried at the Monastery of St. Nicholas at Banja. According to the grave inscription, Dimitrije had held Gacko with Rudine, Drina and Dabar. G. Tomoviƒá theorized that this Dimitrije was the same person as the earlier mentioned nobleman Hrvatin (magnate Vojin's brother) who served King Stefan Deƒçanski (r. 1322‚Äì31) and held Rudine (1330). In 1350, ƒêurica and Andronik are mentioned as ƒçelniks. After Jovan Oliver and Dimitrije, it seems that the title of veliki ƒçelnik was not given at the Serbian Imperial court. The territories held by Dimitrije were eventually consolidated by Vojin's son Vojislav (fl. 1350‚Äìd. 1363). It was earlier believed that Dimitrije died in 1359.

It is an erect shrub with sticky, shiny leaves and branches and with flowers that are either red with darker red blotches inside or cream- coloured without spots or blotches. Description Eremophila lucida is a glabrous shrub with sticky, shiny leaves and branches due to the presence of large amounts of resin. It grows to a height of between and its branches have raised ribs under each side of the leaf attachments. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and there is a large, raised lump where the leaf attaches to the branch. The leaves are mostly long, wide, linear to elliptic in shape and covered with small raised resin glands. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a flattened, glabrous stalk which is usually long. There are 5 sticky, overlapping, glabrous sepals which are mostly long and which are either pale yellow, greenish yellow, or red with a bluish tinge. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube may be yellow without spots, or deep red with prominent darker blotches in the tube and on the lowest petal lobe. The outer surface of the petal tube is glabrous but the inner surface is covered with glandular hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs between August and October and the fruits which follow are almost spherical in shape, slightly compressed, have a papery covering and are long. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila lucida was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (lucida) is a Latin word meaning \\"clear\\" or \\"bright\\" in reference to the leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat Shining poverty bush is only known from two small areas between Hyden and Norseman in the Coolgardie biogeographic region  one near Lake Cronin, the other near Lake Cowan. It grows in sandy soil near salty depressions. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Use in horticulture The bright green leaves of this large shrub contrast with its pink or white flowers making it an attractive garden plant. It is fast-growing, although sometimes short-lived, and hardy, requiring minimal watering during long droughts and is frost hardy. It can be propagated from cuttings and grown in well-drained soil in a sunny or partly shaded position.
