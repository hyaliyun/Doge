Two of her novels were adapted into films.  Life and career  Peggy Louise Goodin was born to Goldie Leona Shimp and James Lawrence Goodin, an automobile dealer, in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up in Bluffton, Indiana. She later said that she spent her time in Bluffton \\"trying to make the boys' football team, winning medals for oratory, and annoying her teachers.\\" Goodin was involved in literary pursuits from an early age, serving as the editor of her school paper and yearbook. Goodin earned an A.B. from the University of Michigan in 1945. While there, she won the prestigious Hopwood Award in 1942, 1943, and 1945. Her final win was for the work that would become her first novel, Clementine, which she wrote in the basement of the Chi Omega house on campus. On June 28, 1946, Goodin published Clementine with Dutton. The novel is a coming-of-age story about a red-haired tomboy named Clementine. In a starred review, Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a chronology with funny, tender highspots, that manages growing pains without parody or maudlinity,\\" concluding that it was a \\"very pleasant, lightly subsurface tale of adolescence, which sneaks up on you.\\" The novel was adapted into the film Mickey in 1948; subsequent printings of the book used both titles on the cover. Goodin earned an M.A. from McGill University in 1949. While attending McGill, she wrote book reviews for the McGill Daily. Her second novel, Take Care of My Little Girl (Dutton, 1950), began as her masters thesis. In it, Goodin examines the racism, classism, and religious prejudice of Greek life on a college campus. She sold the film rights to the book for a reported $30,000. Take Care of My Little Girl was released as a film in 1951. The Lie, about a mother who must pass her daughter off as her sister, was Dutton's top fiction title for the fall of 1953. However, Kirkus reviewed it with much less enthusiasm. Goodin's final novel, Dede O'Shea, was released by Dutton on May 29, 1957. Of its eponymous heroine, Kirkus wrote, \\"A ragingly young Californian makes a pleasant heroine with an addiction to truth  and consequences.\\"  Works  Clementine (1946) * Mickey (1948) * Take Care of My Little Girl (1950), filmed as Take Care of My Little Girl (1951) * The Lie (1953) * Dede O'Shea (1957)  References  = Further reading = Smith, David L. \\"Peggy Goodin.\\" Hoosiers in Hollywood, IHS Press, 2006. *\\"Adolescence in Indiana: Clementine, by Peggy Goodin.\\" Review by Thomas Sugrue.

The play explores the experiences of the parents of a nonverbal, sometimes violent, autistic boy and the emotions that they experience on the night before he is taken to a residential school for children with disabilities. The play starred Charlie Brooks, Simon Lipkin, Michael Fox, and Hugh Purves, and was produced by Paul Virides Productions at the Southwark Playhouse. An early draft of All in a Row was long-listed for the Bruntwood Prize for Playwriting, and the play was chosen as one of the Bolton Octagon Theatre's Top Five in 2017. It was published by Methuen Drama in 2019. The play has had a polarizing effect on critics and audiences for its use of a puppet to portray an autistic child. Development All in a Row was inspired by Oates' ten years of experience working with autistic children and adults. Oates workshopped the script and puppetry with director Dominic Shaw, and Si√¢n Kidd designed the puppet used for the character of Laurence. Prior to rehearsal period, the team contacted the National Autistic Society for consultation on their portrayal of autism. NAS arranged for both autistic and non-autistic people to provide advice, and minor changes to the script were made as a result of this feedback. Despite these changes, NAS released a statement that they could not support the play overall due to its portrayal of autism. In the development stage, the team decided that the initial design for the Laurence puppet was too stylistically dark to sensitively portray the character, and a more childlike, yet still abstract, design should be explored.  Characters  The play's main characters are: * Laurence, an 11-year-old boy on the autism spectrum, who is unable to speak and is sometimes physically aggressive. Laurence is portrayed by a puppet, operated by puppeteer Hugh Purves. * Tamora, his mother, who feels overwhelmed trying to keep Laurence safe and prevent him from harming others. Tamora is played by Charlie Brooks. * Martin, his father. Martin is played by Simon Lipkin. * Gary, a worker who helps care for Laurence. Gary is played by Michael Fox.  Plot  The play opens with Laurence watching Finding Nemo and begins with an intertwined pair of monologues: Tamora is giving a motivational talk at an all-girls technology college about her heartbeat-transmitting product, the Heart to Heart, and Martin is describing an incident that occurred in a park in which Laurence attempted to bite a little girl. The rest of the play is presented in real time over the course of an evening. Somebody has phoned social services and reported that Laurence has bruises. As a result, there has been a social services enquiry resulting in the decision to move Laurence to a residential school where he can be better cared for. A whodunnit, or who- phoned-it, theme runs throughout the play as Martin tries to discover who is responsible for the call that resulted in Laurence's departure. The support worker, Gary, acts a conversational go-between for Martin and Tamora as they try to bring themselves to read a social story to Laurence detailing how he will be leaving home. Martin speaks to Gary about his concerns regarding residential schooling, and Tamora confides in Gary her worries and insecurities. As the evening progresses, Martin and Tamora's relationship degrades, and they begin to argue. This comes to a head when Martin accuses Gary of making the phone call, and Tamora reveals that she was the person who called social services, acknowledging her inability to cope and feeling that Laurence would be better cared for by professionals. A furious argument triggers a meltdown from Laurence, and he bites his mother. In the aftermath, Martin and Tamora call something of a truce, and they sit down as a family to read the social story and watch the end of Finding Nemo.  Casting and puppetry  The video trailer for All in a Row generated controversy by showing that the autistic child would be portrayed by a puppet During casting, autistic and disabled performers were encouraged to apply. Producers stated that two members of the team that they recruited were autistic, but declined to name them in order to respect the requests of those individuals. The character of Laurence is played by a life-sized, custom-made puppet (operated by a puppeteer), rather than a child actor. Oates told the Newcastle Chronicle and the BBC that his decision to use puppetry was based on multiple reasons, including his admiration for puppetry and the idea that Laurence is a metaphorical puppet of the system, which denies him autonomy over his life. Just like the puppet used to portray him on stage, Laurence is treated like an object that is manipulated by neurotypical people. Oates also said he thought that using a puppet as a \\"creative medium\\" was a more sensitive decision than asking an actor to mimic the condition. Puppetry director Si√¢n Kidd built the puppet out of natural materials intended to give Laurence a soft quality and chose the colour grey in response to the set design, to make Laurence feel like part of his surroundings.  Themes  Love. The exploration of \\"love\\" as a concept is a recurring theme of All in a Row. This is particularly evident in the character of Tamora, named after the Shakespearean mother in Titus Andronicus, as she tries to determine how to best keep her son safe. Her husband, Martin, is portrayed as a perpetual child who is hung up on the notion of love. In addition, the product that Tamora invents was born from her belief that love transforms during parenthood. Family. The play juxtaposes the movie Finding Nemo with its main story to draw parallels between the characters in each; both stories feature parents who are struggling with letting their children go and doing what is best for them. It also explores pressures and insecurities that can come with parenting a child with special needs, including comparing oneself to other parents and dealing with the guilt of contemplating whether life without their child would be easier. Disability. Laurence's abilities and needs as an autistic child are a central theme, and the play looks at stereotypes and mistakes that people make around disability and the autism spectrum. At one point, the support worker, who is otherwise a likeable character, makes an ableist suggestion and is reprimanded immediately, suggesting that everyone can get it wrong sometimes. The play also explores whether residential schools for children with disabilities or institutionalization are, in fact, the ideal solution for disabled children, concerns about restraining methods, etc., and the challenge of making an informed decision. Reception = Use of puppetry = Much of the feedback for All in a Row focused on the decision to have Laurence represented by a puppet instead of a living actor. While some critics felt that the puppet was an effective representation, criticisms of the play started to emerge when a video trailer for the production was released showing the autistic character portrayed by a puppet. The controversy spawned the Twitter hashtag #puppetgate. Special education promoter Anna Kennedy was invited to an open rehearsal, which she reviewed, stating that she believed employing a puppet in place of a child was appropriate, as the role would have been too challenging for a child actor. The Reviews Hub also argued that it would have been too hard for a person to play the role of Laurence. Writing for The Guardian, Miriam Gillinson gave the play four stars, calling it lively and truthful and saying that the puppet had a \\"human feel\\". In contrast, WhatsOnStage.coms Jane Kemp said that the puppet added nothing to the production that a living actor couldn't have provided. Writing for The Stage, Fergus Morgan called the presence of a puppet a \\"wrong-headed decision.\\" Saskia Baron of The Arts Desk gave the play a one-star rating, criticizing the puppet as a \\"redundant, clumsy distraction.\\" The National Autistic Society, which helped the production by providing consultation, released a statement on Twitter that, \\"While recognising some of the play‚Äôs strengths, we decided we could not support the play overall due to its portrayal of autism, particularly the use of a puppet to depict the autistic character alone.\\" The artistic director of Southwark Playhouse defended the decision in a statement on Twitter: On press night for All in a Row, February 18, 2019, performer Paul Wady, founder of the Stealth Aspies Theatre Company, organized a protest outside of the theatre to condemn the use of a puppet to portray an autistic child. Actress Charlie Brooks, who portrays Tamora in the play, responded to the controversy, saying, \\"I understand people's concerns, but I do urge people to come and see the play first before they judge.\\" = Representation of autism = Critics had other issues with the play's portrayal of the autism spectrum beyond the use of the puppet. Dr. Shaun May, a senior lecturer in drama and theatre at the University of Kent, wrote a thorough review of the play outlining some of these concerns, including broader issues, such as lack of meaningful engagement with the autistic community and venue accessibility, and more specific issues regarding the portrayal of autism in the script, including the puppet's stationary expression giving the impression of \\"nobody there\\"; Tamora's personality seeming to evoke the \\"refrigerator mother\\" trope; and the repeated comparisons of Laurence to animals, particularly dogs. He draws parallels with the portrayal of the learning-disabled character, Lennie, in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and refers to a critique of this character written by disability studies specialist Sonya Freeman Loftis. British theatre director Stephen Unwin also weighed in on representation in his review, criticizing the play for seeming to suggest that all of the family's problems are Laurence's fault. Autistic blogger Purple Theo aka Graham Gilligan disagrees with Unwin's opinion that Lawrence is the root cause of his parents problems in his review of the playAuthor and mother to four autistic children Sarah Ziegel praised the play for its honest depiction.

The center was founded by Drs. Steffanie Strathdee and Robert \\"Chip\\" Schooley, both professors at UC San Diego School of Medicine. The center currently treats patients with life-threatening multi- drug resistant infections with phage therapy, on a case-by-case basis, through the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA‚Äôs) compassionate use program. IPATH aims to initiate phase I/II phage therapy clinical trials, focusing on patients with cystic fibrosis and infections related to implantable hardware, such as pacemakers and prosthetic joints.\\"\\". With OK From FDA, UC San Diego Researchers Prepare to Launch Novel Phage Study. Retrieved February 19, 2019. The first planned clinical trial is set to look at otherwise healthy cystic fibrosis patients that are shedding Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Phage therapy Phage therapy is the method by which bacteriophages (viruses which infect bacteria) are used to treat bacterial infections or reduce bacterial populations. Phage therapy has gained recent attention in the United States as an alternative to standard antibiotic therapy. It has been in practice for just over 100 years in countries such as Russia and Georgia, but due to the recent clinical attention of antibiotic resistance, Western countries have slowly been integrating phage therapy into their medicinal arsenal. Currently, in the United States, phages are used for treating bacterial infections only when patients have multi-drug resistant (MDR) life-threatening infections, or when patients are immunocompromised and antibiotic therapy is not a viable option. To date, the majority of phage therapy in the United States has been administered intravenously (IV), by utilizing the Emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) process which is regulated by the FDA.  Phage therapy at UC San Diego School of Medicine  Dr. Tom Patterson was the first patient to be treated with phage therapy at a UC San Diego hospital in March 2016. Patterson had a systemic Acinetobacter baumannii infection that manifested while he was on vacation with his wife, Dr. Steffanie Strathdee, in Egypt. Strathdee advocated and connected with phage researchers around the United States and secured the help of friend and fellow UC San Diego professor, Robert \\"Chip\\" Schooley, who was head of the Division of Infectious Disease at the UC San Diego School of Medicine at the time. Researchers from Texas A&M; University, Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, the US Navy, and San Diego State University, worked to source and purify phage that could be used to treat Patterson's infection intravenously. The FDA gave their approval for Patterson's phage therapy, through the eIND mechanism. After eight weeks of phage therapy, in conjunction with 12 weeks of antibiotics, no evidence of Acinetobacter baumannii was found in Patterson's body following June 6, 2016. After positive media attention from Patterson's phage therapy, Drs. Schooley and Strathdee began to receive phage therapy requests from around the globe. They were involved in the treatment of five other phage therapy patients at UC San Diego School of Medicine and consulted on numerous cases throughout the United States and Europe, before officially establishing IPATH in June 2018.  Future of IPATH  Since establishing in 2018, IPATH has been lead by Co- Directors Strathdee and Schooley, and have set out to lay the foundation for an academic center on the forefront of translational phage therapy research. Schooley and Strathdee bring with them numerous years of research experience and experience in designing clinical trials, which they are utilizing to initiate the first phage therapy clinical trails at UC San Diego School of Medicine. IPATH clinical trials will be housed at UC San Diego's AntiViral Research Center, which has been conducting clinical trials since 1986. Initial clinical trials are planned to focus on multi-drug resistant infections associated with cystic fibrosis and implantable devices.

Also in December 2018, Family Tree DNA allowed the law enforcement agencies including the FBI to upload DNA profiles from crime scenes to help solve cold cases. So from then onwards GEDmatch was not the only site that could be used by law enforcement officials to solve crimes using genetic genealogy. As of April 2019, GEDmatch had been used in at least 59 cold case arrests, most of which were the work of Parabon Nanolabs and their chief genetic genealogist CeCe Moore, as well as 11 Jane and John Doe identifications across the United States, most of which were run and funded by the DNA Doe Project. In May 2019 GEDmatch tightened its rules on privacy which were forecast to make it much more difficult for law enforcement agencies to find suspects using GEDmatch.  Usage by law enforcement agencies  Terry Peder Rasmussen was convicted for the 2002 murder of his live-in girlfriend while living under a pseudonym in California. He had previously been imprisoned under a different alias in a child abandonment case. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department used GEDmatch to find the girl's family and concluded that her mother, Denise Beaudin, had disappeared from New Hampshire in the early 1980's after dating Rasmussen. Although Rasmussen died while imprisoned in 2010, genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter linked his DNA to the Bear Brook murders in Allenstown, New Hampshire. Authorities confirmed Rasmussen was the Bear Brook killer in 2017. * California law enforcement investigating the Golden State Killer case uploaded the DNA profile of the suspected serial rapist/killer from an intact rape kit in Ventura County to GEDmatch. It identified 10 to 20 distant relatives of the Golden State Killer, and a team of five investigators working with Barbara Rae-Venter used this to construct a large family tree, which led them to identify former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo as a suspect. Investigators acquired samples of his DNA from items he discarded outside his home, one of which definitively matched that of the killer. The process took about four months, from when the first matches appeared on GEDmatch, to when DeAngelo was arrested in April 2018. * In September 2018, Roy Charles Waller was arrested as a suspect in a series of more than ten rapes between 1991‚Äì2006 in Northern California (the \\"Norcal Rapist\\") after DNA evidence from crime scenes were matched on GEDmatch to a relative. Police then constructed a family tree and using the known characteristics of the rapist narrowed the suspects down to Waller. It took little more than a week to identify and arrest the suspect. He was charged with a total of 40 counts of rape which took place in different counties ‚Äî Sonoma, Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo and Butte. *in March 2019, Paul Jean Chartrand was identified by the FBI's Investigative Genealogy Team as the murderer of Barbara Becker on March 21, 1979 in San Diego. She had been repeatedly stabbed in the neck and back. Investigators found blood in several rooms of the La Jolla home. Police at the time said Becker, 37, had tried to escape and fought against her attacker, and that some of the blood was his. However, Chartrand had already died in 1995 of undisclosed causes. *In April 2019, Terrence Miller of Edmonds, Washington was arrested for the 1972 killing of 20-year-old Jody Loomis. Loomis left her home and rode her bicycle toward a stable to ride her horse. Her body was found raped, disrobed, and shot in the head in the woods. This is the second arrest in a Snohomish County cold homicide case using results from genetic genealogy, the sheriff's office said in its statement. Police worked with Deb Stone, an Oregon genealogist, to identify the suspect. Miller pled not guilty. Miller was scheduled to go on trial on June 5, 2020, however his trial was postponed due to Covid 19.https://www.heraldnet.com/news/48-years-after-jody-loomis-was-killed-a- trial-draws-near/ *In April 2019, Arthur Rudy Martinez was posthumously identified as the 1977-1978 murderer and rapist of 30-year-old Jane Morton Antunez and 28-year-old Patricia Dwyer Morton in Atascadero, California, Antunez was killed in her car and Dwyer was stabbed to death in her home. Martinez, who'd been paroled after unrelated convictions for attempted murder and rape, lived in the area at the time of the deaths but left soon after. He moved to Spokane, Washington, and received life sentences there for several robberies and two rapes also in 1978. After 16 years in prison in 1994, he escaped and lived under an alias in California until 2014 when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Washington state and turned himself in to receive medical treatment in prison. He died behind bars two months later. The homicide cases were reopened with the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search Team seeking a familial DNA match to the evidence. Authorities said it led them to a relative of Martinez and a former girlfriend who provided investigators the DNA sample from a razor he had used. A lab determined the DNA from the razor matched that from the crime scenes. *In May 2019, James Richard Curry was identified as the killer of Mary Silvani, formerly known as \\"Sheep Flats Jane Doe\\"/\\"Washoe County Jane Doe.\\" DNA collected from Silvani's rape kit was uploaded to GEDMatch, leading to a tentative identification of the killer. However, the suspect had recently died. After DNA from his son, located in a criminal database, ruled the suspect out, further investigation led to Curry, a half brother born out of wedlock in 1946 and raised in Dallas, Texas under a different family name. Curry died in California on January 7, 1983, from injuries inflicted in a suicide attempt after confessing to three murders in California. His two children volunteered to provide DNA samples after being contacted by investigators. Silvani was also identified using genetic genealogy, making this the first known case in which both the victim and the perpetrator were identified in this way (both through the work of genetic genealogist Cheryl Hester). *In May 2019, a grand jury in Orange County, North Carolina indicted John Russell Whitt on first-degree murder charges related to the death of his son, Robert ‚ÄúBobby‚Äù Adam Whitt. Bobby Whitt's skeleton was discovered under a billboard on Interstate 85-40 in September 1998; an autopsy showed that he had died by strangulation. Although the case remained open, and hundreds of investigators worked on it over the years‚Äîincluding forensic artist Frank Bender‚Äîthe remains were unidentified until Barbara Rae-Venter analyzed a DNA sample that suggested the boy had one white parent and one Asian parent. Using online genealogical services, she located a cousin in Hawai'i, who was able to provide the boy's name. The family had not reported him missing because they believed his mother, Myoung Hwa Cho, had taken him back to South Korea, where she was from. Further investigation revealed that Cho's body had been located in Spartanburg County, South Carolina on May 13, 1998. She had been suffocated, and had ligature marks around her wrists. John Whitt has confessed to both murders; at the time of his arrest for the murders he was serving a federal prison sentence at the Ashland FCI for armed robbery and was not eligible for release on that charge until 2037. On January 15, 2020 Whitt pled guilty to two counts each of second-degree murder and concealing a death and was sentenced to 26 to 32 years for each murder, to be served consecutively after he completes his sentence in federal prison for robbery in 2037. *Eddie Lee Anderson was arrested in May 2019 for killing 30-year-old Leslie Penrod Harris in May 1976 and dumping her body near Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Orange County, California sheriff's officials said in a news release. The FBI's Investigative Genealogy Unit had assisted the local police in identifying Anderson as a potential suspect. Harris was dining with her husband at a restaurant in Costa Mesa the evening of May 17 and went out alone around 8:30 p.m. She still hadn't returned by the time the restaurant closed, and her husband reported her missing, authorities said. At about 4:30 the next morning, military police from the air base found Harris‚Äô nude body lying on a roadway just outside its perimeter. She had been strangled. *In June 2019 Mark Manteuffel was arrested in Decatur, Georgia by FBI agents and charged with brutal rapes, sodomy, torture and inflicting bodily harm using a knife in Sacramento, California between 1992 and 1994. Manteuffel was a retired federal prisons worker and had lectured on criminal justice. Police used the services of the Sacramento DA and GEDmatch to indicate him as a possible suspect and used a sample of his DNA from a restaurant to match with the DNA from the crime scenes. Manteuffel pled guilty to the charges in July 2020 and was due to be sentenced on August 14 and faces over 30 years in prison.https://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/guilty-plea-anticipated- for-1994-davis-greenbelt- assault/https://www.google.com/s/sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/07/02/sacramento- serial-rapist-mark-manteuffel-guilty-rapes/ Parabon Labs assisted identifications In cooperation with American law enforcement organizations, Parabon NanoLabs started uploading DNA evidence from crime scenes to GEDmatch and joined forces with genetic genealogist CeCe Moore to offer genetic genealogy services to law enforcement to identify perpetrators of violent crimes. Parabon said in November 2018 they said they were working on 200 cases and about half had produced workable matches. CeCe Moore is the head of the genetic genealogy unit responsible for most of the successful investigative genetic genealogy cases. =2018= May In 2018, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office announced the arrest of William Earl Talbott II, a former truck driver, as a suspect in the double murder of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg. Law enforcement investigators from the state of Washington investigating the murder had worked with Parabon NanoLabs to assemble a digital DNA profile of the suspected murderer and uploaded it to GEDmatch. The website had two relatives who were relatively close matches to the DNA profile, and within two days the genealogist CeCe Moore was able to narrow down the profile to one suspect. In June 2019 Talbott was convicted of two counts of murder and sentenced to two life sentences, both without parole. June Law enforcement in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania working with Parabon NanoLabs used GEDmatch to identify a relative of the murderer in the 1992 sexual assault and murder of the schoolteacher Christy Mirack in her home in East Lampeter Township. Raymond Charles Rowe (also known as \\"D.J. Freez\\"), was arrested in June 2018. He and Mirack frequented some of the same clubs, and Rowe's route to work took him past Mirack's apartment, Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said, Stedman said Rowe did not provide a motive when he confessed. Rowe pled guilty to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life without parole. He has since been moved State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Waymart. * Law enforcement also used GEDmatch and Parabon's genetic genealogist CeCe Moore to narrow down suspects to two brothers in the 1986 rape and murder of 12-year-old Michella Welch in Tacoma, Washington. Gary C. Hartman, one of the brothers, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and first-degree rape in June 2018, after police collected his DNA from a discarded restaurant napkin. He pleaded not guilty. In 2019 Washington state passed \\"Jennifer and Michella's law,\\" named after Michella Welch and Jennifer Bastian, a 13-year-old girl who was also murdered in 1986. This law allowed police more latitude in taking DNA samples from convicted sex offenders. * GEDmatch was also used by CeCe Moore to identify the murderer of 40-year-old Virginia Freeman, who was killed in Brazos, Texas in 1981, as James Otto Earhart. Earhart had already been executed in 1999 for another murder. July In July 2018, John D. Miller confessed to the 1988 rape and murder of 8 year old April Tinsley near Fort Wayne, Indiana, after DNA samples were sent to GEDmatch by Parabon and used to identify his relatives. Miller was sentenced to 80 years in prison. * Spencer Monnet was identified using GEDmatch and arrested in July 2018 for the burglary and rape 79-year-old Carla Brooks in St. George Utah, 14 weeks after the crime had been committed. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years to life in prison and has since been moved to the Central Utah Correctional Facility.

He pled not guilty and initially faced between 20‚Äì60 years in prison however the state found a way to give him a natural life sentence. Henslick's trial began on February 10, 2020 and ended on February 14, with Henslick being found guilty of first degree murder. Henslick was due to be sentenced on March 20. However his sentencing was postponed indefinitely due to the Covid-19 pandemic but has since been sentenced to life in prison and is imprisoned in the Stateville Correctional Center.https://www.news- gazette.com/coronavirus/jim-dey-pritzkers-coronavirus-rules-get-under-county- sheriffs- skin/article_cda643d2-138c-5133-b949-8656843cb861.htmlhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Pages/OffenderSearch.aspx September In September 2018, Marlon Michael Alexander was arrested as a suspect for a series of rapes in Montgomery County, Maryland between 2007‚Äì2011 after DNA samples from the rapes were submitted to Parabon who linked the perpetrator through GEDmatch to two relatives, one of whom, a female relative in Georgia, helped the local police identify Alexander. Alexander plead guilty to two offences. In May 2019 he was found guilty of three rapes and sentenced to two concurrent life sentences in jail although he is now asking the judge to reduce the sentence. He has since been sent to the North Branch Correctional Institution. * Luke Fleming was arrested in September 2018 as a suspect in the 1999 rape and murder of Deborah Dalzell in Sarasota, Florida. Using autosomal DNA from his sperm and GEDmatch, Parabon and genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter constructed a family tree which pointed to a Florida resident Joseph Fleming, who was dead, but had two living sons, one of whom, Luke Fleming matched DNA from the crime scene. Luke Fleming's trial began on February 25, 2020 and on February 27, he was found guilty. He was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences since the prosecution did not seek the death penalty against Fleming. Fleming is now imprisoned in the Central Florida Reception Center. October In October 2018 Parabon's CeCe Moore used GEDmatch to identify Robert Eugene Brashers, a \\"violent serial rapist and murderer\\", as the 1990 killer of 28 year old Genevieve Zitricki in Greenville South Carolina, as the rapist of a 14-year-old girl in 1997 in Memphis Tennessee and the murder of 12-year old Megan Sherer and her mother 38-year-old Sherri Sherer in Portageville, Missouri in 1998. Brashers had committed suicide in 1999 after he was approached by police officers in Kennett, Missouri. His body was exhumed in 2018 and confirmed a match to DNA from the crime scenes. * Parabon's technology and the work of CeCe Moore led to the arrest of Michael Wayne Devaughn in the murder case of 65-year-old Betty Jones and in the sexual assault case of 81-year-old Kathryn Crigler in Starkville, Mississippi in 1990, who died two months later (called the 'Labor Day Murder'). Devaughn, already in jail for a drug offense, was arrested in October 2018. He faces either the death penalty or life without parole. He pleaded not guilty. * Parabon helped the Faulkner County, Arkansas police identify Edward Keith Renegar in October 2018 as the primary suspect of the kidnap, rape and murder of 32 year old Pam Felkins in Greenbriar, Arkansas in 1990.

November In November 2018 the Fulton County, Georgia police with the aid of Parabon's DNA Genetic Genealogy unit, tracked down and arrested 61 year old Jerry Lee in Alabama for the 1997 murder of 28 year old Lorrie Ann Smith. It was obvious that Smith had fought for her life and Police were able to use blood from the murder scene to extract the killers DNA. The police noted at the time of the arrest that \\"Despite a reward of more than $30,000 and DNA tests conducted on more than 100 individuals over the last 21 years, Police had been unable to positively identify the suspect until this week.\\" In May 2019, Lee was released on $150,000 bond. * In November 2018 Maryland police, with the help of Parabon, arrested Fred Frampton Jr. for the armed robbery and shooting of 24 year old Michael Anthony Temple Jr. in Odenton, Maryland in 2010 leaving Temple a quadriplegic.

Frampton plead guilty to murder and in September 2019 was sentenced to 55 years in prison.https://www.baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/09/21/glen-burnie-man- sentenced-to-55-years-in-prison-for-2010-murder/ He has since been incarcerated in the Western Correctional Institution. * In November 2018, Benjamin Lee Holmes was arrested as a suspect in the murder of University of Central Florida student Christine Franke 17 years earlier on October 21, 2001 when she was shot in the head during a robbery in Orlando, Florida. Parabon used a sample from the crime scene to put the DNA of the killer into GEDmatch and identified three distant cousins. CeCe Moore used genealogy techniques to narrow down to the most likely suspects. Law enforcement interviewed family members, collected DNA samples and compared them to the killer's DNA. Detective Michael Fields said \\"Through this testing, we were able to show the kinship relationship between the killer and different family members. We eliminated most of the family using genetic genealogy and eventually, we were able to narrow down the suspect list to two brothers, one of which was Benjamin Lee Holmes.\\" Holmes pleaded not guilty and his trial was tentatively scheduled for August 2019 then rescheduled for June 2020. * Parabon and geneticist Barbara Rae-Venter helped the Carlsbad, California police In November 2018 identify David Mabrito as the suspected killer of 39 year old Jodine Serrin in 2007 using DNA matches to some of his relatives. Mabrito was an itinerant who had family in the area and had already died in 2011. Police discovered they already had an unprocessed DNA sample from Mabrito that matched Serrin's killer. * Parabon and CeCe Moore used GEDmatch to point towards John Arthur Getreu as a suspect in the murder by strangulation of 21-year-old Stanford University graduate Leslie Marie Perlov in 1973 in Santa Clara, California. After Police found Getreu's DNA matched the DNA from the scene of Perlov's death they arrested him. Getreu was also later charged with the 1974 murder by strangulation of 21-year-old Janet Taylor in Palo Alto, California. Getreu has since been tied to an additional murder in the same area. he pleaded not guilty to either of the crimes. December In December 2018, Christopher Quinn Williams, was arrested in Montgomery, Texas as a suspect in multiple burglaries since October 2015. The burglar broke into homes and fondled sleeping women.

His trial date was set for October 14, 2019, however his trial instead began on February 10, 2020 and was ordered to take place outside of Linn County due to the publicity of the case. Burns pled not guilty and denied killing Martinko during an interview with police. He could not provide a \\"plausible explanation\\" for why his DNA would be in Martinko's car. Burns was convicted of first degree murder on February 24, 2020, and was due to be sentenced in early April but was rescheduled for August and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. =2019= January In January 2019, Florida Police announced Parabon had identified William Louis Nichols as the violent rapist of a 12-year-old girl in Hernando County, Florida in 1983 using genetic genealogy but Nichols had already died in 1998 of cancer.

Munns has a criminal history that shows he was charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct in 1998 to which he pleaded guilty and was in prison from 2001 to 2007 being released on probation. Bit was incarcerated again when his community supervision was revoked and was released in 2009 but was sent back July that same year for failing to register as a sex offender but was released in October that year. *Jesse Bjerke was arrested in February 2019 for abducting and raping at gunpoint a female lifeguard after following her home from a pool on South Pickett Street, Alexandria, Virginia in 2016. Parabon Nanolabs and CeCe Moore helped police using genetic genealogy techniques. If convicted Bjerke would have faced life in prison. In October Bjerke pled guilty and was originally due to be sentenced on March 19, 2020, however after also pleading guilty to a similar August 1, 2015 rape in Fairfax County he was rescheduled to be sentenced on May 15, however his sentencing was rescheduled again due to the coronavirus and on October 2, he was sentenced to 65 years in prison. March In March 2019, Police in South Dakota arrested Theresa (Josten) Bentaas for the 1981 homicide of her baby boy. The 38-year-old cold case of the dead abandoned baby was solved using DNA from genealogy sites to identify the child's mother. The Sioux Falls police discovered a full-term baby dead, wrapped in a blanket and abandoned in a cornfield ditch. The cause of death was judged to be exposure to the elements. The baby's father was already found on February 15 and he was not charged because he never knew about his son's birth or death. She was charged with first-degree murder, along with the lesser included offenses of second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Vannieuwenhoven was deemed incompetent to stand trial. *In March 2019, Coley McCraney, a truck driver with no criminal record, was arrested after genetic testing and the work of Parabon's Genetic Genealogy Team matched his DNA to evidence collected in 1999 from a car trunk that contained the bodies of two girls shot to death in Ozark, Alabama, authorities said. Tracie Hawlett and J.B. Beasley, both 17, had headed out to a party on July 3, 1999, but never arrived. They became lost, and Hawlett called her mother to say they had gotten directions and were headed home. They never arrived there, either. Their bodies were found the next day in the trunk of Beasley's car, less than a half-mile from the pay phone Hawlett used to talk to her mother. Both had been shot in the head, authorities said. Despite hundreds of interviews and seemingly endless hunting, a suspect was never found. The police chief released no details on a possible motive or what the suspect said to investigators following his arrest. McCraney is being held without bail and a preliminary hearing will be scheduled within two weeks, Adams said. McCraney pled not guilty. McCraneys trial was originally scheduled for February 3, 2020 but was rescheduled to May 4, 2020, however due to Covid 19, McCraney‚Äôs trial was rescheduled to 2021. https://www.dothaneagle.com/news/local/crime-and- courts/mccraneys-jury-trial-in-deaths-of-j-b-beasley-tracie-hawlett-continued- to-2021/article_bda3508e-fda8-11ea-9a6a-5fe54ee0ce09.html Prosecution said they would seek the death penalty. *Montana police announced in March, 2019, that, with the help of GEDmatch and Parabon, they had identified Cecil Stan Caldwell as the prime suspect in the murder of 24-year-old Clifford Bernhardt and the sexual assault and murder of his wife 24-year-old Linda Bernhardt in Billings, Montana in 1973. However Caldwell, a former co-worker of Linda Bernhardt, had already died in 2003. *Marquise D. Dozier was arrested in Indiana for three rapes that took place between 2015‚Äì2017.

AprilIn April 2019, Greenville, South Carolina police arrested Brook Graham for abandoning her infant daughter in February 1990, the infant was dead when discovered. Parabon linked the baby's DNA to a relative of the father on GEDmatch using genetic genealogy. Police allege Brook Graham put her newly born infant, along with the placenta and umbilical cord, into a cardboard vacuum cleaner box and ditched the baby in a field near a pile of debris in February 1990. The case is called the \\"Julie Valentine\\" case, based on what investigators named the baby. She was originally charged with homicide by child abuse but that was upgraded to murder. The case was the second one to be solved by Parabon using GEDmatch and genetic genealogy in Greenville in a 6-month span after a now-dead man named Robert Eugene Brashers was identified in October 2018 as a serial killer who committed one murder in Greenville. In May 2019 Brook Graham was also charged with unlawful neglect of a child and desecration of human remains in connection with the body of another baby (a boy) found dead in April 1989 in Greenville County. *In April 2019, Richard E. Knapp was arrested after Parabon used his DNA to find his relatives using genetic genealogy. The police matched Knapp's DNA to that left at the scene of the July 17, 1994 rape and murder of 26-year-old Audrey Hoellein in Vancouver, Washington. *In April 2019, police from Centerville, Utah arrested a 17-year- old boy for allegedly assaulting 71-year-old Margaret Orlando on November 17, 2018 while she was practicing the organ in a church meetinghouse. Initially Parabon refused to take on this case but the Police got special permission from Curtis Rodgers, the founder of GEDmatch, on the grounds that the assailant could strike again. Utah detectives found a rock with the alleged perpetrators DNA and sent it to Parabon, which used GEDMatch and genetic genealogy to identify the suspect. Although this was not the first time GEDmatch had been used by Law Enforcement for a case that did not involve homicide, rape or kidnapping (see the case of Christopher Quinn Williams, above), it was the first to gain widespread attention and lead to a fierce backlash about unregulated access by police to genealogy databases. Because of this, GEDmatch significantly tightened up its rules of access by law enforcement agencies. The teen plead guilty to his crimes and was sent to a youth lockup where he could stay until his 21st birthday depending on his progress.  May In May 2019, Terre Haute Police Chief Shawn Keen announced that Parabon had helped the agency to identify Jeffrey Lynn Hand as the possible killer of Pamela Milam, 19, who was raped and strangled in 1972. She was last seen on the night of Sept. 15, 1972, leaving a sorority event at Indiana State University in Terre Haute, Indiana southwest of Indianapolis. Her body was found bound and gagged in the trunk of her car the next night. With the help of Parabon and GEDmatch, police found Hand's widow and two sons, obtained their DNA and after submitting it to Indiana's state crime lab concluded that Hand was almost certainly the killer. Hand was killed in a shootout with police in 1978 during an attempted kidnapping. Hand had been previously arrested in 1973 for killing a hitchhiker he picked up, but pleaded not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. The case was never tried and Hand was freed from prison in 1976, *Brian Leigh Dripps confessed to the sexual assault and murder by stabbing of 18-year-old Angie Dodge in 1996 after Idaho Falls, Idaho Police charged him in May 2019. Dripps had lived in the same street as Dodge. Parabon's CeCe Moore identified Dripps using GEDmatch and genetic genealogy. Dripps pled not guilty at a September court appearance. Previously the police had targeted other men for the murder  one of whom, Chris Tapp, had been sentenced to life with a minimum of 20 years in prison. Tapp was exonerated in July 2019 based on the new evidence and Dripp's confession. Dripps trial is scheduled for June 8, 2021 and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Dripps. *In May 2019 Seattle, Washington Police announced that the DNA from Frank Wypych matched the DNA from the killer of a 20-year-old Susan Galvin. Galvin, a Seattle Police Department records clerk, had died in 1967 from strangulation and had been sexually assaulted. CeCe Moore at Parabon built family trees of the matches on GEDmatch and found only one man could have been Galvin's killer's, which lead police to identify Wypych as a suspect. Wypych had already died in 1987 but Wypych's body was dug up to make the confirmatory DNA match. At 52 years old this was the oldest case to be solved using GEDmatch until a man murdered in about 1963 whose body was not found until 1985 was identified in June 2019, as Roger Kelso. *Johnnie B.

Since the event began in 2014, participation has more than doubled each year. Veganuary can also refer to the event itself. History Founded by Jane Land and Matthew Glover, the first event was January 2014. The name \\"Veganuary\\" is a portmanteau of \\"vegan\\" + \\"January\\". Programme Veganuary is a crowdfunded campaign to issue a challenge each January promoting eating vegan for the month. Participants sign up online and receive a downloadable \\"starter kit\\" and daily support emails. They're offered an online \\"vegan starter kit\\" with restaurant guides, product directories, and a recipe database. Participants are encouraged to share images and recipes to social media, which according to academic Alexa Weik von Mossner creates a sense of community and communicates the message that veganism is easy and fun. Reception Gentleman's Quarterly noted \\"it's a clever way to introduce a new way of nutritional thinking at a time of year where our mind is hardwired to explore ways to better ourselves\\". A January 2019 slump in UK pub receipts was blamed on Veganuary. Von Mossner notes that criticism can be raised over the fact that Veganuary uses \\"images with happy-looking, baby-faced animals while at the same time downplaying (though not completely omitting) the horrific truth about the lives and deaths of the actual animals that are nevertheless slaughtered everyday for human consumption\\". Another point of criticism may be \\"the campaign's strict emphasis on food rather than on other aspects of the vegan lifestyle and worldview\\". Impact Tobias Leenaert postulated the popularity of the campaign may be partially due to the organizers' decision to promote \\"trying\\" veganism for a specific period vs. \\"going vegan\\", which allows participants to decide not to continue with an all-vegan diet without feeling as if they've failed. Von Mossner agrees and points to the \\"light-hearted\\" and generally positive tone of the promotional materials, which feature attractive and \\"frequently named animals\\" with captions like, \\"Save little Eric‚ÄîTry Vegan this January\\" rather than images of animal abuse. 400,000 people signed up for the 2020 campaign. The campaign estimated this represented the carbon dioxide equivalent of 450,000 flights and the lives of more than a million animals. Signups for the 2019 event were reported to be as many as 14,000 per day for a total of 250,000 signups from 193 countries by the end of December. In 2018, 170,000 people signed up, a 183% increase over 2017 numbers. For the 2017 campaign, 50,000 participants had signed up as of 4 January of that year.

Characterized by rounded spiracles and white and brown spots, females grow to and males to .  Taxonomy  Torpedo mackayana was described in 1919 by Jan Metzelaar (1891‚Äì1929), a Dutch biologist.  Description  Torpedo mackayana has a round, \\"fleshy\\" disc, which has a slightly greater width than length. It has a gray-brown or rusty- brown upperside and a white underside. It is covered with small patches of brown or white. These patches may differ significantly in size and distribution throughout its body. It has a long, strong tail and two dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is broad, while the second is slightly smaller and more slender. Its teeth are distributed in up to 38 rows and it has visible flaps on its nostrils. It has rounded spiracles, a feature that does not appear in any other species in the genus Torpedo. Torpedo mackayana is a small to medium-sized ray. Its growth and size was surveyed in the Coast of Senegal from 1994 to 1998, with the results having been published in 2001. This study showed that it has an average length of about and an average weight of at birth. Females typically reach sexual maturity at about and males reach it at . As an adult, females are larger than males. According to the survey, the length of adult females is and the length of adult males is . The largest female observed weighed and the largest male weighed .  Ecology  The reproductive cycle of Torpedo mackayana can take a year, and gestation can take nearly half a year. Ovulation happens in May or June, and young are born in August or September. Like other species in the genus Torpedo, the oocyte of the species is sometimes prevented from growing until birth. Females have two uteri and two ovaries. The eggs of the species, when fertilized, weigh about on average, and the oocytes weigh an average of . Torpedo mackayana has a coastal habitat and lives in depths of . It has been found in estuaries and on sea floors of mud or sand. Its prey consists of fish and smaller invertebrates. Little else is known about its biology.  Distribution and conservation  Torpedo mackayana lives in tropical waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, in 16 countries on the western coast of Africa. The most northern part of its range is Senegal, and the most southern part is Angola. It is likely caught by fisheries as a bycatch. Pollution and habitat destruction, due to coastal development, are also threats in part of its range. However, nothing is known about its population size or trend, except that it is not severely threatened. The adult population consists of more females than males, while young are more commonly male than female. No conservation actions are taking place for the species, and it is listed as data deficient on the IUCN Red List as of 2007. According to the IUCN, further research is required of the species' population before planning conservation actions.

Although his military service was primarily to the King of England, his reputation for chivalry and poetry was renowned throughout Europe.  Life  Oton de Grandson was born in Savoy between 1340 and 1350 to William of Grandson and his wife Jeanne of Vienna. His family was of the highest nobility. On September 25, 1365, he married Jeanne d'Allamande, daughter of Humbert d'Allamand, lord of Aubonne and Coppet. He was captured in combat in 1372 by the Spanish, allies of France, and spent two years in prison. In 1374 he was ransomed by the King of England Edward III and returned to military service. When his father died in 1386, he returned to Savoy and inherited the lordship of Sainte-Croix, Grandcour, Cudrefin, Aubonne and Coppet. He became the primary advisor of Am√©d√©e VII, called the Red Count. He was imprisoned again for some time in 1389 for unknown reasons.  Duel  When the Red Count died following an accident on horseback, his mother Bonne of Bourbon, was accused of murdering him. Oton was also implicated in the ensuing controversy that pitted the various regional lords against each other. Oton fled to England; he was condemned and his lands confiscated in 1393. In 1395, however, Oton was declared innocent by the French king, Charles VI and he returned to Savoy. Accusations against him were renewed, however, and he was forced to engage in a judicial combat by the young count Am√©d√©e VIII. He was killed by his accuser, G√©rard d'Estavayer, a much younger man, on August 7, 1397. A near contemporary poet, Olivier de la Marche, recorded the details of the duel in his chronicle Livre de l'advis du gaige de bataille. The ch√¢teau of Oton de Grandson, dating from the 11th century, is in Switzerland.  Reputation  Oton de Grandson had a reputation as a fine and courteous knight. The poet and chronicler Jean Froissart hails him as the paragon of knightly valor in his Chroniques. However, it is his poetic prowess that endures. He is celebrated by poets such as Eustache Deschamps, Christine de Pizan, Alain Chartier, Martin Le Franc, Georges Chastellain, Oliver de La Marche and Geoffrey Chaucer, all of whom imitated his courtly poetry. He was friends with Deschamps and Chaucer. The woman loved faithfully by Oton de Grandson, sometimes referred to as Isabelle (in acrostic in the Souhait de saint Valentin, the Complainte de Grandson, and the Songe de saint Valentin) also called \\"la non-per France,\\" of too high estate for him to hope for, might have been Isabeau de Bavi√®re, queen of Charles VI. This steadfast love, faithful even to death, voiced over and over through his poetry, earned him the reputation of the most courtly lover in France.  Poetry  Oton de Grandson composed around 80 poems during his life, for a total of more than 6,000 verses. Among them are #La Complainte de saint Valentin, written in octosyllables (extant in 4 manuscripts) #La Complainte de l'an nouvel, written in decasyllables (extant in 2 manuscripts) # La Pastourelle, written in octosyllables (extant in 5 manuscripts) # Le Livre Messire Ode, written in octosyllabic couplets (extant in 3 manuscripts) # La Complainte amoureuse de saint Valentin (1 manuscript) # La Complainte d'Amour (extant in 14 manuscripts) # L'Estrenne du jour de l'an # Le Lai de plour # Le Songe de sain Valentin (imitated by Chaucer in The parlement of Foules and the Book of the Duchess) # La Belle dame qui eut mercy was attributed to Oton de Grandson by Piaget in 1904, but by 1941 this attribution was retracted.

It is native to New Guinea and northern Australia. In Australia it is found in both the Northern Territory and Queensland. In the Territory, it is found in the bioregions Arnhem Coast, Cape York Peninsula, Einasleigh Uplands, Gulf Fall and Uplands, Gulf Plains, Northern Kimberley, Pine Creek, Tiwi Cobourg, and Wet Tropics. in the Territory, it has been found flowering in January, February, April, May, June, July, September, October, and November, and fruiting in those months but also in March, August and December. Description Acacia simsii is a smooth shrub which grows to a height of 1 to 4 metres. The phyllodes are linear to narrowly elliptic, straight (sometimes incurved) and 5‚Äì14 cm long, 2‚Äì7 mm wide. They have pointed tips and are leathery, with 3 or 4 main nerves and few longitudinal minor nerves in between. There is a gland 0‚Äì2 mm above the pulvinus, and up to five others along the adaxial margin. The inflorescences normally occur as group of heads in the axils on stems (peduncles) 5‚Äì12 mm long. The bracts at the base of the flowers persists., and the heads are globular, having a diameter of 3.5‚Äì4 mm. The inflorescence consists of 25 to 35 golden flowers. The flowers have five parts, and the sepals are free or joined for up to 2/3 of their length. The leathery, smooth pods are linear, and flat but raised over the seeds, and up to 8 cm long and 4‚Äì7 mm wide. The dull brown-black seeds are longitudinal, almost circular to broadly elliptic, 2.5 to 4 mm long, with a clublike aril. It is usually found growing on gently undulating terrain, in sand and gravel in open eucalypt forest and woodland, sometimes in closed heath, and sometimes forming a closed scrub /in disturbed areas. It is closely related to A. multisiliqua which has generally shorter phyllodes with the lowermost gland normally further removed from the pulvinus, a shorter peduncle and larger, differently shaped seeds. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1842 as part of the work Notes on Mimoseae, with a synopsis of species as published in London Journal of Botany. It was reclassified as Racosperma simsii by Leslie Pedley in 1987 but transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006.

Winslow was the President of the recreational enterprises division of Warner Bros. from 1992 to 1999, as a result he made the announcements about theme parks in development. Prior to Warner, Winslow was the Vice President (V.P.) of rival film studio Paramount Pictures for their technical subsidiaries from 1975 to 1980. Paramount Pictures During Winslow's time with Paramount he served as the President to various minor subsidiaries such as Paramount Sound, Magicam Inc., and Future General Corp. Warner Bros. Recreational Enterprises When Winslow joined Warner Bros. in 1992, he was an adviser to the then President of Warner Bros. Recreational Enterprises C. V. Wood. When Wood died on March 14, Warner Bros.' Co-Chief executive officer's (CEO) Terry Semel and Robert A. Daly chose Winslow to lead the theme park division. With expansion the main goal, Winslow began scouting locations for the next Movie World park, in his pursuit to find the perfect location he came upon golden opportunity in Bottrop, Germany, the site for the former Bavaria Film theme park. In December 1993, it was announced that Warner Bros. Recreational Enterprises would demolish the former Bavaria Film Park which had closed in earlier that year, and use the empty site to build Warner Bros. Movie World Germany. In May 1994 the sale of the park to Warner Bros. was finalized and construction began. The construction lasted roughly two years and the park's grand opening happened June 29, 1996. Winslow served as the host for the grand opening ceremony which was in attendance by stars like Chris O'Donnell, and Michael Douglas On February 13, 1996, at a press conference in London, England Winslow along with fellow executive Sandy Reisenbach represented Warner Bros. at the announcement of Warner Bros. Movie World England. At the time Recreational Enterprises was working with the Mills & Allen International group, the owner of local news stations ITV Anglia and ITV Meridian, to develop the park. The project was projected to cost ¬£225 million to develop the 150-acre site in Hillingdon and to built the new sound stages and attractions, it was estimated to create 3,000 jobs for the surrounding area. By the next day the project was being vigorously opposed by objectors, including three local Tory MPs. Plans for Movie World England were cancelled later that year with no large announcement. Shanghai Expo In 2008, after working as a private consultant for the last decade, Winslow was brought on to lead a team to work on the USA Pavilion for the Shanghai Expo. Part of his job consisted of trying to get private companies to sponsor the US Pavilion, since a federal tax cut bill a decade prior prohibited the federal funding of a pavilion. Winslow and his team struggled to find enough sponsors to float the cost of construction, bringing the United States involvement into question. Secretary of state Hillary Clinton urged American support for the pavilion, and stated that, \\"The U.S. presence at the Expo will showcase American business, culture and values in China's most dynamic city and foster an even stronger friendship between the American and Chinese peoples.\\" \\"There is a sense in the U.S. that Americans got disenchanted with [World's Fairs],\\" said Winslow when asked about the difficulty of finding sponsors. Despite the initial obstacles, with the added help of Clinton's fundraising expertise enough sponsors were found to fully fund the US Pavilion at the Expo.

In spite of their various important roles in the Haitian Revolution, women revolutionaries have rarely been included within historical and literary narratives of the slave revolts. However, in recent years extensive academic research has been dedicated to their part in the revolution. Women in pre-revolutionary Saint-Domingue In the French colony of Saint-Domingue, enslaved Black women suffered particular forms of gendered violence in addition to the standard abuse and mistreatment of slaves. Rape and sexual abuse of enslaved women commonly occurred in the colony; part of the logic of slavery was that since slaves were property, they could be used as sex objects by slave owners. Due to high infant mortality and a low fertility rate, slave women were kept from engaging in monogamous family relationships and instead treated as objects of reproduction. Suicide was used as an early act of resistance to the sexual violence committed against enslaved women. Women's roles in the revolution The Haitian Revolution was instigated by slaves in an attempt to not only liberate themselves but to remove the French from the island entirely. Rebels used a variety of tactics to meet this goal; women participated in all levels of the revolt. = Labor organising = As laborers, enslaved women began to organize and refuse to perform life-threatening work. In one such case, women who worked the night shift in a sugarcane mill protested working with machinery in the dark that could seriously injure or kill them. = Vodou = The practice of Vodou was a tool of the Haitian Revolution. Enslaved women who escaped their slave owners to live as maroons were able to return to their roles as practitioners of Vodou because they would not be punished for rejecting French Catholicism. Communities of escaped slaves turned to Vodou mambos, or priestesses, which radicalized them and facilitated the organization of a liberation movement. Vodou mambos were also typically knowledgeable of herbal remedies as well as poisons, which were weaponized and used against French slave owners and their families during the revolution. Ideologically, the image of a Haitian Vodou priestess inspired insurgents to fight the colonial government in order to not only liberate themselves but to serve a higher, spiritual purpose. The most famous mambo in Haitian revolutionary history is C√©cile Fatiman. Born of an enslaved woman and a slave owner, she is remembered for having performed a Vodou ceremony for hundreds of rebel slaves the night before the revolution began, inspiring them through ritual song and dance to take up the fight for freedom. She reportedly lived to be 112 years old, never ceasing to practice Vodou. Another woman, D√©d√©e Bazile, has a similar legacy as a mystic of the revolution. Although D√©d√©e was not known as a mambo, she became known as D√©fil√©e-la-folle, or D√©fil√©e the Madwoman. Born to slaves, D√©d√©e had several children conceived by rape committed by her master. Her ‚Äúmadness‚Äù was allegedly caused by the murder of her parents by French soldiers as well as the many instances of sexual violence she endured. After the murder of revolutionary leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines, she is said to have been responsible for gathering his decomposing remains, reassembling the pieces of his mutilated body, and ensuring that he be buried with dignity. Today, D√©d√©e is hailed as an icon of the Haitian Revolution, a symbol of the ‚Äúmadness‚Äù of the Haitian people's commitment to their land. = Combat = Women also took up arms and served in the anti-colonial Haitian military, participating at all levels of military involvement. Some scholars attribute the widespread participation of women in combat to West African traditions of allowing women to actively serve in battle. Some progressed as high up the ranks of the military as possible; Marie-Jeanne Lamartini√©re, for example, served in Toussaint L'Ouverture's army.

They served as military nurses, relying on herbal and folk medicines to treat rebels in remote areas with little to no resources. In addition, women worked as spies, posing as sex workers and merchants in order to deliver messages and gain information about the French. Some women are reported to have used sex to obtain money, weapons, resources, military intelligence, manumission, or mercy for themselves or loved ones. These incidents were rarely the choices of the women involved; rather, women's bodies were used by Haitian military forces to further the revolution, which reinforced the pre-revolutionary patriarchal exploitation of women.  Punishments  Because of the high involvement of women in the Haitian Revolution, colonial French military forces let go of their plans to institute gender-specific punishments. When captured, women revolutionaries were executed alongside men, only occasionally receiving special treatment on the basis of their gender. Sanit√© B√©lair, a Black freedwoman who served as a lieutenant in the army of Toussaint L'Ouverture, was sentenced to death following her capture. At the moment of her execution, she refused to be blindfolded by her executioners and is documented to have stared them in the eyes as she died.

Created in 1883, by Tommy Fallot, the league supports the abolition of prostitution and is opposed to pornography, alcohol and gambling. Initially the league opposed alcohol and pornography, but after Fallot met with English anto-prostitution activist Josephine Butler, the end of prostitution was added to its aims. It initiated many actions against films before self-dissolving in 1946. The league published a monthly magazine, The Social Recovery, from 1893. In 1946, it succeeded La R√©novation, and reformed as the Cartel d'action sociale et morale (Cartel of social and moral action). History The League was founded by people with Protestant views, especially Christian socialism, and often linked to the left wing and the League of Human Rights. Its secretary-general at the end of 19th century was Louis Comte, a Dreyfus pastor. Tommy Fallot and Edmond de Pressens√© were prominent members, as was the suffragette Jeanne Schmahl. A number of personalities, including academics, have been members of the league, including Beno√Æt, rector of the University of Montpellier; Vidal, professor of criminal law; Gustave Monod; Paul Bureau, professor at the Institut Catholique de Paris and president of the League from 1906 to 1923 (who succeeded Paul Gem√§hling, professor of Strasbourg and Jewish denomination); the economist Charles Gide, president of the Soci√©t√© de protestation contre la licence des rues from 1910; the Dean of the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris, Raoul Allier and the sociologist Albert Bayet. In the early 1920s, it had several deputies and senators and also a minister, radical-socialist Justin Godart (also deputy then senator of Lyon). In addition, in the 1930s feminist C√©cile Brunschvicg, deputy secretary of the Blum government, and Georges Pernot, minister of the Flandin government in 1930 and member of the Republican Federation (center-right). The league moved more and more to the right after the First World War, until under √âmile Pour√©sy (author of La gangr√®ne pornographique (The Pornographic Gangrene) (1908) becoming Petainist in 1940. The league, however, did not accept the endorsement of brothels by Vichy. Re-established under the name of the Cartel d'action sociale et morale after the war, it obtained, thanks to the deputies of the Mouvement r√©publicain populaire (MRP), the passing of two important laws, the Loi Marthe Richard abolishing the brothels, and the law of July 16, 1949 on publications aimed at young people. Prostitution and pornography In terms of prostitution, the league particularly opposed the Soci√©t√© de protestation contre la licence des rues, led by the \\"Father modesty\\", Ren√© B√©renger, who wanted to deregulate prostitution and brothels. The fight against \\"pornography\\" covers a broad spectrum; it tries to convince the railway companies to repaint the walls of the toilets more often in order to erase obscene graffiti. √âmile Pour√©sy and the league often oppose La Vie Parisienne. Although formed mostly of bourgeois, the league is difficult to classify on a political level. E. Pour√©sy addresses the Action Fran√ßaise League, by invitation, who see him as a defender of neo-Malthusianism. At the third congress of the movement, in 1905, the philosophy professor Edmond Goblot accused the bourgeoisie as being the cause of prostitution. Lyon Section The LRMP had a very active local branch in Lyon. The branch protested the presence of swimmers near the Quai Saint-Vincent and the showing of the 1923 film La Gar√ßonne. This prompts a police investigation of mayor √âdouard Herriot, which concludes there has been no wrongdoings. (La Gar√ßonne was, however, prohibited from broadcasting in Lyon, in 1941, under Vichy). The local did however obtain the prohibition in 1933 of La Marche au Soleil, a film about the nudism in France. In 1936, it mounted a campaign, along with members of the La Cagoule (an illegal underground organization), against Abel Gance's film, Lucrezia Borgia. The film was banned by Georges Cohendy, the president of the special delegation of Lyon under Vichy in November 1940. Le Cartel d'action sociale et morale In 1946, the League was re-formed as Le Cartel d'action sociale et morale (the Cartel of Social and Moral Action). It was directed by Daniel Parker, who sued to Boris Vian over the novel I Spit on Your Graves. Among its members were Maurice Leenhardt, professor at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes; Canon Viollet (a former member of the Resistance); physician √âdouard Rist; Andr√© Mignot, deputy leader of the MRP and mayor of Versailles and Charles Richard-Molard, General Delegate of the Cartel. The Loi Marthe Richard, which led to the closing of brothels, was proposed by MRP deputy Pierre Dominjon, a member of the Cartel. Dominjon also pushed through the vote of the law of July 16, 1949 on publications intended for the youth . Daniel Parker was sidelined after Gaston Gallimard discovered, by use of a private detective, his taste for underage boys; he was succeeded by Andre Mignot.

Scholarship  = \\"Is Poverty a Driver for Risky Sexual Behaviour? Evidence from National Surveys of Adolescents in four African Countries\\" (2007) = Madise co-authored this article with Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and James Ciera. The research was motivated by two factors; firstly, the high prevalence of HIV among young people in Africa. Secondly, the fact that there did not seem to be an academic consensus on the relationship between poverty and risky sexual behaviour in Africa; the results would depend on the type of data collected, the number of participants and what the working definition of sexual intercourse was. At the Macro level research has shown that poorer countries suffer more than wealthier ones when there is an HIV epidemic. On a Micro level though some of the wealthiest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa such as Botswana and South Africa have the highest rates of HIV in the region. This is counterintuitive to data at the Macro level which supports the fact that poorer countries will likely have fewer resources to invest in prevention services. Finally, on an grass root level, there seems to be a positive relationship between wealth and the prevalence of HIV on the African continent. The spread of HIV in African countries is linked to mobility. Wealthier people will travel and expose themselves more to people with HIV thus facilitating the spread. To get to the root of this issue Madise, Zulu and Cierra set out to address this by collecting data from four different countries Burkina Faso, Malawi, Uganda and Ghana with over 19500 participants between the ages of 12 and 19. These countries were chosen because they would provide different levels and contexts of HIV prevalence. Their results showed that girls who are in the wealthiest quintiles in Malawi, Burkina Faso and Ghana had later sexual debut compared to those who are poor. This was not the case for Uganda. Furthermore, wealthy adolescents were more likely to have used condoms in their last sexual act. Finally in Uganda and Ghana wealth status had a positive relationship with the likelihood to have more partners. The report that poverty increases the likelihood of poor girls having sex is consistent with research that has shown that this is done in exchange for gifts and money. The paper also highlights that adolescents who are in school are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse before those who are not in school. The paper concludes that poverty influences the likelihood of risky sexual behaviour, especially among young females. = \\"Protecting female migrants from forced sex and HIV infection\\" (2017) = In this paper, Madise and Bernard Onyango begin by assessing the issue from a macro-level pointing out the fact that 30% of women globally have been victims of abuse perpetrated by someone that they know. This abuse has negative emotional, mental and health effects for women. Madise and Onyango cite the paper by Julie Pannetier and colleagues in The Lancet Public Health which shows that some migrants to Europe are infected with HIV when they reach their destination. This is contrary to popular belief that many of these migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are infected with the epidemic before they arrive. The authors point out that women who migrate are usually low skilled workers fleeing home countries because of poverty and high risk of sexual violence. A report by the UNHCR suggests that some of these women are forced to pay for their transportation and documentation to get to Europe through exchanging sexual favours. A lack of basic needs such as shelter and healthcare when they arrive in Europe increases the risk of them being sexually abused because they are vulnerable. The vulnerability is heightened by poverty which increases inequality and leads to a power imbalance between the rich and poor. This power imbalance will lead to a woman depreciated view of her sense of self-worth and ultimately lead to her transactional sex. The paper concludes that since females form a significant proportion of people who migrate there is a need for a gender-based analysis when designing migration regulations and policies. = \\"Is There an Urban Advantage in Child Survival in Sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence From 18 Countries in the 1990s\\" (2011) = Madise co-authored this article with Philippe Bocquier and Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu. Observing the pattern of higher child mortality of rural-to-urban migrants compared with urban nonmigrants, Madise, Bocquier, and Zulu compared DHS data from 18 African countries to argue that it is not necessarily the place of residence but access to services, and economic opportunities that matter for child survival. They used DHS data collected from 18 African countries between 1995 and 2001 and examined the migration status of the mother and compositional effects, such as differences in socioeconomic status, sanitation, and individual child characteristics. Comparing rural-to-urban migrants with urban natives, migrants only do worse than natives in less than one-half of the countries‚Äîtherefore, the perceived disadvantage in child survival of urban migrants relative to urban natives is not universal. Those moving from rural to urban areas may be relatively wealthier or those with better access to health services than other rural inhabitants. On the other hand, children of urban dwellers who migrate to rural areas have very high mortality while in urban areas relative to other urban inhabitants, because they tend to be the poorest slum dwellers and those without access to services. Their findings confirm the view that child mortality is lower in urban areas than in rural areas, but if rural households have access to sanitation and services, and if their economic well-being improves, rural childhood mortality can decline to levels that cancel out the so-called urban advantage.

De Filippo was born in Turin on 6 April 1869 to Giuseppe De Filippi, a lawyer, and Olimpia Sella. Personal and professional life As a doctor he specialised in physiological chemistry and in experimental aspects of surgery, lecturing at Bologna and Genoa universities. He married Caroline Fitzgerald in 1901, a poet, daughter of William John Fitzgerald. In World War I he volunteered as a lieutenant colonel in the Red Cross and was posted to London from 1917 to 1919 where he ran the Italian office of propaganda and information. He was awarded the honorary knighthood of KCIE in 1916. He was the editor of the travel and exploration section of the Enciclopedia italiana. He died at Settignano near Florence on 23 September 1938. Expeditions Well known as an Alpine mountaineer, in 1897 he joined the Duke of the Abruzzi in an expedition to Alaska where they were the first people to climb Mount Saint Elias on 31 July. Then, in 1903, he explored Asia, crossing the Caucasus and entering Turkestan. In 1906 he wrote the book about (though did not take part in) Abruzzi's exploration of the Ruwenzori mountains on the Uganda‚ÄìCongo border. In 1909 he again went with the Duke of the Abruzzi, this time in the Karakoram mountains, writing the book describing the expedition. In 1913-1914, De Filippo organised and led a large and highly successful scientific expedition to Central Asia: Baltistan, Ladakh and Xinjiang. Accurate gravity and magnetic measurements were made and wireless signals were used to determine longitude. There were ethnological and anthropological, topographical and geological studies. The exploration determined that the Rimo Glacier formed the watershed of Central Asia. The work was written up in seventeen volumes.

The building is a High Victorian Gothic Revival English country house and a Grade II* listed building. It stands in a landscaped park that is Grade II listed. Architecture The house was built in 1859‚Äì62 for Frederick Gough, 4th Baron Calthorpe. It was designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon, who was noted for his polychrome brickwork. It is built of red brick and stone dressing, with bands and decoration in black brick. It is an ornate design with hipped and mansard roofs with gables and dormers, tall brick chimneys and an entrance front dominated by a tall tower. The interior is notable for its fireplaces. The house has a porte-coch√®re that was added in 1901 and a dining room that was added in 1911. Both are designed \\"deceivingly\\" to match the original house. The architectural historians Nikolaus Pevsner and David Lloyd called Elvetham Hall \\"A major house of [Teulon], but not one anybody would praise for beauty\\". Another architectural historian, Mark Girouard, called it \\"the holiest or unholiest of zebras, being not only striped, but also zigzagged and diapered all over with bricks, and slates of different colours... like an enormous multi-coloured jelly\\". Estate The Elvetham estate was established by Sir William Sturmy in 1403 after inheriting the possessions of his uncle Sir Henry Sturmy in 1381. He died there in 1427 and the estate, along with his main seat at Wulfhall in Wiltshire, passed to his son-in-law John Seymour. It passed down in the Seymour family and was visited by Elizabeth I, who planted an oak tree that still stands in the park. The estate passed to the Calthorpe family in the middle of the 17th century. The original manor house burnt down in 1840. St Mary's church in the grounds of Elvetham Hall A Church of England parish church was built on the estate in 1840‚Äì41. It is in Norman revival style and faced with flint. It has a broach spire that may have been added by Teulon. The church is east of the current house. It is no longer used for worship. Frederick Gough, 4th Baron Calthorpe inherited the estate in 1851 and had the present house built in 1859‚Äì62. He died there in 1868, after which the estate and house passed in turn to his sons Frederick Gough-Calthorpe, 5th Baron Calthorpe and Augustus Gough- Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe. The latter established in 1900 what has become a noted herd of shorthorn cattle. His Southdown sheep and Berkshire pigs were also famous. In 1953 the Hall and gardens were sold to ICI, then to Lansing Bagnall of Basingstoke. The gardens were restored in 1962 when a croquet lawn and tennis courts were laid out. The hall was run as a conference centre in the 1960s but is now an hotel. Air crash Consolidated Liberator GR.VI: the same model as the Liberator that crashed at Elvetham On 5 October 1945 a Consolidated Liberator GR.VI transport aircraft of No. 311 Squadron RAF crashed in a field on the estate, killing all 23 people aboard. The Liberator had just taken off from RAF Blackbushe on a flight to Ruzynƒõ Airport, Prague. The Liberator's five crew and 18 passengers were Free Czechoslovaks returning home after the end of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. The passengers included the wife of the flight engineer, and five babies and toddlers travelling with their mothers.

NVL opened in a former McCormick & Schmick's restaurant December 2017, following an approximately $1 million renovation. The venue was named Willamette Week 2018 Bar of the Year. The club hosted a variety of acts and events but was most known for electronic dance music (EDM). Conflict between NVL, a neighboring tenant, and the property manager began almost immediately. In February 2019, the bar closed as the result of the dispute and financial difficulties; some scheduled events were moved to other venues. Description and history Prior to the nightclub's opening, No Vacancy was a party held at the FOMO Media offices in northwest Portland, beginning in 2014. The party's success allowed co-founders Rick Sheinin (who worked at FOMO Media at the time) and Billy Vinton, along with partners Nitin Khanna and Jessey Zepeda, to host No Vacancy at other venues, including Doug Fir Lounge, Holocene, and Produce Row. Lake Oswego Review Sam Stites described the four men as \\"innovators\\" seeking to \\"raise the bar in Portland nightlife\\". Sheinin, Vinton, and partners opened No Vacancy Lounge (NVL) in December 2017, in the ground floor of the Henry Failing Building, in downtown Portland's Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. The building was previously occupied by a McCormick & Schmick's restaurant. According to the Portland Mercury, the owners \\"oversaw a dramatic redesign of the wood-paneled restaurant into a modern 350-person-capacity nightclub that attracted top talent [and] drew large crowds\\", at a cost of approximately $1 million. The interior featured \\"elegantly designed\\" Art Deco details and high tech production equipment. Writing for Willamette Week, Matthew Korfhage said: \\"The mezzanined space [looked] like Jay-Z's vision of the Great Gatsby, an amber- lit world of deco lamps, columned archways and backlit liquor that climbs to the ceiling\\", with \\"a massive amount of programmable lights, a dramatically lit second-story DJ booth and smoke machines both inside and outside the DJ area\\". Two weeks after opening, property owners attempted to terminate NVL's lease because of noise complaints made by the upstairs tenant, the architecture firm Walker Macy. Conflict between NVL, Melvin Mark Properties, and Walker Macy continued for as long as the nightclub operated. In February 2019, the club confirmed plans to close as the result of financial difficulties and the ongoing dispute. The co-owners have said No Vacancy \\"might return to its original state as a pop-up party series\\". =Events= NVL hosted a variety of acts and events. Performers included hip-hop disc jockey and producer DJ Nu-Mark, house music DJ Donald Glaude, the electronic music duos Dusky and Eli & Fur, Le Youth, BlackGummy, Zach Carothers of Portugal. The Man, and Canadian EDM DJ Shaun Frank. A-Trak and RJD2 performed as part of the bar's first anniversary celebration. Special events included the \\"Pan-African Gala\\" commemorating Black History Month, which saw Ndaba Mandela pay tribute to his grandfather Nelson Mandela, a \\"420 Celebration\\" with \\"electro soul-funk\\" music, and a gay pride event featuring local EDM DJs called \\"M√∏thership: Planet LGBTQA\\". NVL also hosted a 1990s music dance party and a \\"celebration of life\\" for Vinton's father, Will Vinton. In 2018, the venue hosted the sixteenth annual Bollywood Halloween dance party, a concert featuring local hip-hop artists, and a Gatsby-themed New Year's Eve celebration. In 2019, NVL held \\"Love Sucks: An Emo Valentine's Day\\", a Valentine's Day dance event featuring \\"pop, punk, alternative, and emo classics\\". For their final event in the Henry Failing Building, NVL hosted a free party on February 19, 2019. NVL planned to host events scheduled prior to their closure announcement at other venues. Reception NVL was named Willamette Week 2018 Portland Bar of the Year based on a survey focusing on new establishments. The newspaper said the venue \\"strikes a careful balance between timeless glamor and a futuristic Technicolor utopia\\", and called NVL \\"the most ambitious DJ-forward dance club Portland's seen in years\\". Willamette Week writers also suggested the interior was reminiscent of The Great Gatsby. Sam Stites of the Lake Oswego Review said the venue opened \\"to rave reviews and a consistently packed house\\", and \\"[filled] a nightlife void\\". Stites called NVL \\"a fresh take on the tired nightclub motif\\" and wrote, \\"Step inside No Vacancy Lounge and you might feel as if you've gone back in time and traveled to the future all at once.\\" Jenna Swanberg of Dance Music Northwest said NVL's closure was \\"devastating for us to hear, as the venue did everything right for their attendees and were selling out weekend after weekend\\". She wrote: > No Vacancy Lounge always had great energy, bringing in some of the biggest > names in house music, providing music lovers, bar jumpers, or dance > enthusiasts a safe place to spend their night... So thank you No Vacancy > Lounge for bringing something different to Portland. Thank you for bringing > a new energy to a city. Thank you for the unforgettable nights spent on the > dance floor.

The venue, which opened in June 2003, is a former auto-parts warehouse with an industrial, modern interior. Holocene hosts a variety of events, and was named the city's \\"Best Place to Dance\\" by Willamette Week readers in 2017. Description and history Holocene was established in June 2003 in a former auto-parts warehouse, located at the intersection of Southeast 10th and Morrison, in Portland's Buckman neighborhood. The venue is \\"dedicated to the avant-garde of the Portland art and music scene, with an √ºber-modern interior\\". Jon Shadel of The Washington Post described Holocene as a \\"music and art club with an avant-garde bent... inspired by the minimal techno scene in Berlin\\". He wrote, \\"the bi-level venue in the Central Eastside hosts an eclectic range of independent DJs and genre- blurring musicians, although most lineups tend to focus on up-and-coming sounds in electronic, R&B; and hip-hop.\\" The 5,000-square-foot venue has a \\"stark industrial feel\\" with two large rooms, a bar, high ceilings and a sunken dance floor, which has been described as a \\"living room in the midst of a gritty industrial loft\\". According to Willamette Week Sophie June, Holocene offers \\"boozy slushies\\" and \\"indie-rock shows that often tend toward the psychedelic or the threateningly abrasive\\". The bar has cocktails called Claire's Knee and Kiss Kiss Bangkok. In 2020, Holocene curated Going In, a twenty-track compilation featuring local electronic musicians. The collection raised funds for contributing artists and the venue during the coronavirus pandemic. =Events= The venue hosts a variety of events, ranging from concerts to weddings. According to Willamette Week Sophie June, Holocene \\"began as one of the only spots to bring national-caliber electronic acts to Portland following the fast demise of the B Complex\\". In her guides to Portland, Rachel Dresbeck said the venue hosts many \\"musical experiences‚Äîsecret shows by famous artists, up-and-coming bands that will be famous shortly, veteran and nouveau DJs, house music, shoegaze, modern soul, and other musical attractions keeping hipsters crowding the place\\". The Builders and the Butchers performing at Holocene in 2007 Musicians who have performed at Holocene include Against the Current, Lauren Aquilina, Au/Ra, Beach Fossils, Ryan Beatty, Kadhja Bonet, Clairo, Crumb, Matthew Dear, Duckwrth, Duckwrth:  Future Generations, Tommy Genesis, Tommy Genesis:  Chuck Inglish, Japanese Breakfast, The Japanese House, Jonna Lee, Milk & Bone, Shy Girls, Sasha Sloan, Snail Mail, Tove Styrke, Avey Tare, and Zaytoven.

United States Postal Service, No. 17‚Äì1594, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a case before the United States Supreme Court dealing with whether a government agency can act as a \\"person\\" to challenge a patent within the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act that reformed the patent process within the United States. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled that within context of Leahy-Smith, the government does not constitute a \\"person\\".. Background The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act was passed in 2011 to refine the patent system. Among its major changes include the introduction of a post-grant opposition system, allowing a \\"person who is not the owner of a patent\\" to issue a challenge to one or more claims of a patent that has been granted. Around 1999, Mitch Hungerpiller got the idea of using computerized systems and bar code scanners to help corporations to determine the fate of returned and undelivered mailings to their clients, allowing corporations to update their databases, eliminate names, and otherwise handling mail more efficiently. He established Return Mail, Inc. to provide this service to corporate customers. Hungerpiller applied for and was granted a patent for this system in 2004. One potential customer of the system was the United States Postal Service (USPS). The USPS had spoken to Hungerpiller before and after the patent was granted about licensing the technology, and while they negotiated a licensing deal, the USPS ultimately developed a similar system in-house by 2006 (the OneCode system), negating the need to license the patented system. This had a significant effect on the financial status of Return Mail, Inc., with Hungerpiller forced to lay off many of his staff. The USPS sought ex parte reexamination of Hungerpiller's patent in 2006, seeking to negate it. The Unites States Patent and Trademark Office reviewed the request but ultimately decided that the patent was still valid. Hungerpiller, in return, sought legal tort action against the USPS within the United States Court of Federal Claims in 2011, under for using the patented process without a license. While the Federal Claims case was ongoing, the USPS used the recently passed Leahy-Smith Act to seek a covered business method (CBM) review of Hungerpiller's patent though the Patent office, as allowed for under the Act's new post-grant review processes. The Patent Office agreed with the USPS' assertions, and invalidated the whole of Hungerpiller's patent. Hungerpiller challenged the ruling to the Federal Circuit Appeals Court. There, a 2-1 majority found for the Patent Office's invalidation, further stating that the wording of Leahy-Smith Act did not exclude the government as a \\"person\\" that can challenge the validity of a patent. Prior to 2019 \\" the government had used AIA reviews only sparingly.\\" A \\"government attorney told the justices at oral arguments in February that as of that time, federal agencies had filed a total of 20 AIA petitions.\\" Supreme Court The Supreme Court accepted the petition and heard the case on February 19, 2019. The Court issued its decision on June 10, 2019, reversing and remanding the Federal Appeals Court decision. Justice Sotomayor, writing for the 6-3 majority, stated that the Leahy-Smith Act does not prescribe any language that the government can be considered a person within the Act, and thus cannot challenge a patent. \\"In the absence of an express definition of the term ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the patent statutes, the Court applies a ‚Äúlongstanding interpretive presumption that ‚Äòperson‚Äô does not include the sovereign,‚Äù and thus excludes a federal agency like the Postal Service. Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 780‚Äì781. This presumption reflects ‚Äúcommon usage,‚Äù United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 275, as well as an express directive from Congress in the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C.¬ß1. The Dictionary Act does not include the Federal Government among the persons listed in the definition of ‚Äúperson‚Äù that courts use ‚Äú[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise,‚Äù ¬ß1. Contrary to the Postal Service's contention otherwise, this Court has, in several instances, applied the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person even when, as here, doing so would exclude the Government or one of its agencies from accessing a benefit or favorable procedural device. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600, 604‚Äì605, 614. Thus, the Court here proceeds from the presumption that the Government is not a ‚Äúperson‚Äù authorized to initiate these proceedings absent an affirmative showing to the contrary. \\" \\" Finally, the Postal Service argues that it must be a ‚Äúperson‚Äù who may petition for AIA review proceedings because, like other potential infringers, it is subject to civil liability and can assert a defense of patent invalidity. It would thus be anomalous, the Postal Service posits, to deny it a benefit afforded to other infringers‚Äî namely, the ability to challenge a patent de novo before the Patent Office, rather than only with clear and convincing evidence in defense to an infringement suit. Federal agencies, however, face lower and more calculable risks than nongovernmental actors, so it is reasonable for Congress to have treated them differently. Excluding federal agencies from AIA review proceedings also avoids the awkward situation of having a civilian patent owner defend the patentability of her invention in an adversarial, adjudicatory proceeding initiated by one federal agency and overseen by a different federal agency [wherein both agencies belong to the same executive branch].\\" At the same time, the executive branch of the Federal Government can challenge patent validity in courts, because courts are not a part of the executive branch. The Supreme Court's opinion noted that since 1981, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has allowed government agencies to file ex parte reexaminations. In those proceedings, parties can bring information to the attention of the USPTO, which can then decide whether to reexamine the patent's validity in a proceeding, where the challenger is not involved. Because the third party is not involved in the ex parte process, the Federal government can initiate this process without violating separation of powers. The Court's ruling did not answer the questions whether Federal executive agencies can initiate inter party reviews, but following the logic of the majority, they cannot.

He previously served as the editor of Fortune, Atlanta bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal and founding managing editor, and later editor, of The Wall Street Journal Europe. He co-authored the best- selling autobiography of Walmart founder Sam Walton.  Early life  The son of John W. Huey and Helen Cahill Huey, Huey attended North Fulton High School, and then the University of Georgia, graduating in 1970.  Career  After serving as a naval intelligence officer, he became a reporter for the Dekalb New Era, a local weekly newspaper in Georgia. Huey then joined The Atlanta Constitution, reporting on crime, politics and general features. In 1975, he joined The Wall Street Journal as a reporter in the Dallas bureau. After covering the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, Huey became Atlanta bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal. In 1982, he moved to Brussels to help launch the Wall Street Journal Europe as its managing editor, serving under its editor Norman Pearlstine. Huey became the paper's editor a year later. He returned to the United States in 1985 to become a senior special writer for the Wall Street Journal. = Southpoint and Fortune = In 1988, Huey joined Fortune as a senior editor in the Atlanta bureau. While at the Wall Street Journal, he had developed the idea of a Texas Monthly-style business magazine for the Southeast United States. With the backing of Fortune editor Marshall Loeb and Don Logan, CEO of Time Inc.'s Southern Progress subsidiary, Time Inc. agreed to launch Huey's new magazine idea, dubbed Southpoint. Only nine issues were produced before the magazine was shuttered. Although the magazine was not a success, Huey became known for attracting contributors like Tom Junod and Howell Raines. After Southpoint closed, Huey returned to work for Fortune as a senior editor. In 1989, Huey convinced the reclusive Walmart founder Sam Walton to give a rare interview to Fortune Magazine. That interview eventually led to Huey co-authoring the autobiography Sam Walton: Made in America. Walton died before the book was published, but it became a best seller for several months. Huey moved his office to New York in 1994 to become the deputy to Fortune editor Walter Kiechel. Less than a year later, Huey became editor , appointed by his former Wall Street Journal boss Norman Pearlstine, who had become editor in chief of Time Inc. Huey was credited by media journalists such as Keith J. Kelly, Tony Case Lori Robertson and Kurt Andersen with turning around Fortune, making it \\"newsier, tougher, sexier, funnier, excellent\\", according to Anderson, writing in New York (magazine). During his tenure, cover stories included \\"The Scariest S.O.B. on Wall Street\\", ‚ÄúAddicted to Sex: Corporate America's Dirty Secret‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Toughest Babe in Business‚Äù and \\"The Most Powerful Women in Business.\\" He also recruited new reporters for Fortune including from GQ, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, and Time. New writers included Joe Nocera, Nina Munk, Stanley Bing, and Stewart Alsop. And he was credited with featuring more women and minorities on the Fortune cover, disproving previous thinking that such covers didn't sell well. He was named Editor of the Year by Advertising Age in 1996 and by Adweek in 1998. The Columbia Journalism Review named Huey one of the top 10 magazine editors in the United States. In 2001, Time Inc. created the Fortune Group and Huey was placed in charge of Fortune, Money, Business 2.0, Fortune Small Business and Mutual Fund magazine. = Time Inc. Management = Replacing journalist Walter Isaacson, who left to head CNN, Huey was promoted to editorial director of Time Inc. later in 2001. Editor-in-chief Pearlstine stepped back to larger strategic matters and gave Huey editorial control over Time, Sports Illustrated, the Fortune Group, and with another editor, the lifestyle titles, including People, InStyle and Real Simple. Characterized by media critic Keith Kelly as the \\"most activist editorial director in [Time Inc.] history,\\" within his first year, he had named new editors at People, Sports Illustrated and InStyle. His appointment of Time Inc. outsiders, such as Terry McDonell, former editor of Us Weekly and Esquire Magazine, to become editor of Sports Illustrated, bypassing the traditional Time Inc. promote-from-within practice, was seen as indicative of his editorial activism. He took the top editorial job at Time Inc. in 2006, becoming the company's sixth editor in chief since it was founded, with oversight of 3500 journalists. As editor-in-chief, he created the CNNMoney website with Turner Broadcasting System, combining editorial content from CNN, Fortune and Money. The website ended up making more money than both magazines. In 2009, during the Great Recession, Huey had Time Inc. buy a house in the very depressed city of Detroit and staffed it up with reporters to cover the city for multiple Time Inc. publications. In an interview with New York Magazine after becoming editor-in-chief, Huey described Time Inc. as having a \\"public trust.\\" \\"Some magazines have importance beyond profitability,\\" he said. However, while the company was earning more than a billion dollars of profit on $5.6 billion of revenue when Huey became editor-in-chief, the seven-years of his tenure was a period of rapid contraction of the magazine industry and he laid off almost a third of the staff from core Time Inc. magazines such as Time, People, Fortune and Money. In 2010, Huey became a member of a three-person management committee acting as temporary CEO of Time Inc. He retired from the company at the end of 2012, saying, at the time, \\"Google sort of sucked all the honey out of our business.\\" After the company was sold to the Meredith Corporation in 2017 for $2.8 billion, the Columbia Journalism Review reported that Huey tweeted \\"R.I.P. Time Inc. The 95-year run is over.‚Äù = Subsequent career= Huey became a 2013 Shorenstein Fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. While there, he co-authored Riptide - An Oral History of the Epic Collision Between Digital Technology and the News Business. The oral history project included interviews with 61 media and technology leaders about disruption in the news business. The project was later expanded to include a second volume of interviews with technology journalists. In 2013, Huey received the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism from the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Huey served as member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the advisory board of the Poynter Institute and the Peabody Awards. He hosts the Whole Hog podcast, about Southern culture, for Garden & Gun.  Personal life  Huey is married to Kate Ellis Huey. He has two children.

History The names Blagden Alley and Naylor Court were derived from two 19th-century property owners, Thomas Blagden and Dickerson Nailor. After the Civil War, residential development in Washington, DC, expanded north from downtown to the Blagden Alley-Naylor Court area and attracted several prestigious, affluent residents, including Blanche Bruce, the first African-American to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate, whose historic house is adjacent to the south entrance to Blagden Alley. Many African-Americans migrated to Washington during this time and came to live in the alley itself in simple dwellings, including lean-tos, and shanties. Local residents saw the alley dwellings as a nuisance, and Congress passed a law banning their construction in 1892. In the early 1930s, reformers led by Eleanor Roosevelt sought to eradicate deplorable living conditions in alleys citywide and used Blagden Alley as their model. Much of the neighborhood suffered damage in the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots, and the alley dwellings were largely abandoned. Designation as historic district Naylor Court In 1990, the Blagden Alley Association of local homeowners submitted an application to the District's Historic Preservation Review Board to have Blagden Alley and Naylor Court designated as a historic district. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1990. The listing included 156 contributing buildings, with the majority constructed in the 19th century, including three houses dating back to the 1830s and 40s. With In addition to the Blanche K. Bruce House, the work of several notable architects were identified, including Queen Anne style brickwork on buildings designed by Nicholas T. Haller, the Romanesque Revival style of Thomas Franklin Schneider and Paul J. Pelz, the Classical Revival style of B. Stanley Simmons and Albert H. Beers, and also a residence designed by T. J. Collins. The D.C. Archives and Record Center moved into the former B.F. McCaully & Co.

Ardaji is an American film producer, former international advertising and marketing executive, and restaurateur. Ardaji is particularly notable for his role as producer during the early stages of production for the award- winning American film Ali (2001), which focused on the life of boxer Muhammad Ali. Early career Ardaji founded the Middle East Advertising and Marketing Company (Meamco), a New York-based marketing agency focusing on Arab markets. In 1979, Ardaji signed boxer Muhammad Ali as a spokesperson for Toyota in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region. The famous boxer's voice was broadcast from radios across the Persian Gulf region, boosting Toyota vehicle sales in the region by 18%. For decades, Ardaji maintained a close friendship with Ali and eventually came to realize Ali's film potential. This crucial initial connection later allowed Ardaji to be able to obtain the rights to Ali's life story for the film Ali in 1992. In 1984, Ardaji became the president of Horizon/Meamco after Meamco's merger with Horizon. During the mid-1980s, it was the third largest marketing agency serving the Middle East, and filled in a highly crucial gap for connecting Western products to consumers in Arab cultures. Film industry In 1992, Ardaji founded Roundhill Pictures Corporation and obtained the film rights to Muhammad Ali's life story. In 1992, Ardaji had visited Ali on his 50th birthday and persuaded him to allow a film to be made about his life. Signing on with Sony Pictures, Ardaji then partnered with producer Jon Peters, who started developing the film in 1994. In addition to Ardaji and Peters, other film producers of Ali were Michael Mann, James Lassiter, and A. Kitman Ho. All five producers were given equal credit as for their roles in the film's production. In 2000, Michael Mann became director of the Ali film, which was finally released in 2001 and featured Will Smith as the main star. Later career Later, Ardaji went into the restaurant business and founded Terra Ristorante Italiano with Boston-based chef Ken Oringer in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was featured in the New York Times. Continuing their close friendship from the 1970s, Muhammad Ali continued to visit Ardaji during Ardaji's later days as a restaurateur. In 2005, Ardaji launched Asian fusion cuisine chain Paulimotos Asian Bistro with Japanese chef Masaharu Morimoto of Iron Chef, with locations throughout the U.S. East Coast.

Along with Alva Belmont, she initiated the interracial cooperation of women in the drive for enfranchisement. When the 19th Amendment passed, she turned her activism toward the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and other programs which worked to uplift the black community and prevent the exclusion of and discrimination against blacks in attaining socio-economic and political equality. Early life Irene L. Moorman was born in January 1872 in Virginia. Her mother was a former slave, Johanna (n√©e Enders) Moorman, who had been born in Virginia and in her childhood moved to Washington, D. C. Johanna later returned to Virginia, where she gave birth to 18 children before bringing her daughter, Irene and son Wilson to New Jersey. Career Around 1895, Moorman began a career as a sub-agent in the brokerage business. After four years, she began working at the Metropolitan Mercantile and Realty Company, supervising the firm's operations in Brooklyn. Though a gifted singer, Moorman did not pursue music professionally, instead focusing on business development. She served on the board of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, was a founder and president of the Metropolitan Business Women's Club of Brooklyn and was an active member of the women's auxiliary of the Negro Business League of New York. When she founded the Metropolitan Club in 1906, the stated purpose was to secure sufficient funds to erect a building which could be used for organizational meetings of black businesses and associations. Her efforts were endorsed by several widely-known African-American activists, such as Dr. M. Cravath Simpson and Mary Church Terrell. After collecting sufficient funds, a building was secured and three rooms outfitted, as well as a business office. In 1909, Moorman incorporated the Moorman-Harper Company, with the purpose of managing the hall. The action brought conflict from members of the Metropolitan Club, who alleged she had usurped the project for which they had raised the funds. After judgments were brought against her, Moorman began operating as a newsdealer. In 1910, she took up the cause of suffrage, answering the call of Alva Belmont to join her Political Equality League. She became a regular speaker in regard to women's suffrage, bolstering her image as an active clubwoman and well-known socialist. On November 24 or 28, 1911 in Brooklyn, Moorman married James H. Blackston, a farmer and minister of the Negro Baptist Church. The couple separated in May 1912 and Blackston struggled financially, during their separation. She investigated for alleged fraud for attempting to secure assistance through the mail system. Rev. Blackston filed for an annulment in 1914. He lost his case that they had been married under false representations, claiming he did not know of her previous lawsuits. His case was dismissed in 1915 by the judge who ordered him to pay damages to his wife. One year later in March 1916, she sued for separation and was awarded alimony of $3 per week. That same year, Blackston was one of the people who attended Marcus Garvey's first public lecture in New York City and in 1917, became the president of the Ladies' Division of the New York Chapter of Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). When Garvey relocated his headquarters from Jamaica to New York City, in 1918, Blackston, Carrie B. Mero and Harriet Rogers were the three women who assisted him in incorporating the UNIA and were appointed to his six-member board of directors. She continued her activities in various clubs and was often a featured singer or speaker, both locally and outside New York City, appearing in Philadelphia as well as at a memorial for Madam C. J. Walker in 1919. When the fight for women's suffrage ended with the passage of the 19th Amendment, Blackston, turned her attentions to Garveyism. She became one of the first to purchase stock in his Black Star Line venture when it launched in 1919. She recognized that political activism at the grassroots level was effective in lobbying for socio-economic equality. Long a proponent of uplifting black society and businesses, she suggested that blacks boycott white businesses and create their own enterprises to fill the gaps. By the early 1920s, she was styling her name as Irene or Irena Moorman Blackstone and would use this name for the remainder of her life. In 1930, Blackstone was selected as vice president of the New York City Federation of Women's Clubs and the following year, she took on the mantle of president of both the local branch and state branch of the federation. Throughout the 1930s, she continued to speak and rally for recognition of the black community and women's rights. Known as a fiery and inspiring speaker, she participated in debates rallying women to the Democratic Party and urging the National Council of Women of the United States to defend the rights of all citizens to vote, regardless of their race or previous servitude. In 1944, she was elected as a vice president in the Ethiopian World Federation. Death and legacy Blackstone is remembered for her role in integrating the suffrage fight, bringing racial cooperation into the New York suffrage campaign. She is also remembered for her long service in supporting black unity as a means to acquiring socio- economic and political equality.

It can reach a snout to base of tail length of up to 135 mm. Distribution The species is native to the south east of Australia, mainly on the coast and nearby ranges. There are two subspecies, Egernia saxatilis saxatilis, which inhabits the Warrumbungle mountains of New South Wales, and Egernia saxatilis intermedia which inhabits the rest of the species' range. Ecology Egernia saxatilis is active during the day, and eats small insects, but in some seasons can also eat vegetation. It lives in the crevices of rock outcrops, and stays near the crevice. It is particularly active during warm weather, and often interacts socially. They can be aggressive to other skinks that enter their area. The social organization of these Australian lizards is very complex, as a study has shown monogamous tendencies among this species, contrary to the polygamous tendency of reptiles in general. The adults and young can stay together for over a year, with the female annually producing 2 - 3 young. They are viviparous. Based on examining similar species, it is thought that they can live for 10 years, and are mature by 2 - 3 years. Conservation The species is locally abundant, but distribution is severely fragmented and number of adults appears to be decreasing. Egernia saxatilis was assessed by the NSW Threatened Species Committee, but there was not sufficient data to draw a clear conclusion on how threatened the species was, though due to the declining population further investigation was suggested.

There are two parts of the story, and it is written from the point of view of Jakub Proch√°zka, the first Czech astronaut. He is sent on a solo mission in space to a cloud of \\"intergalactic dust\\" near the planet Venus that no other country is willing to risk sending their citizens to inspect. He leaves behind his wife for this 18-month mission. While alone, he meets a giant arachnid named Hanus and becomes friends with him. Jakub wants to escape his past so desperately that he is willing to travel hundreds of millions of miles to be free from it. Background Jaroslav Kalfar was born in 1989, one year before the Velvet Revolution in Prague, Czech Republic. When he was fifteen, he immigrated to America in 2003. He spoke very little English at the time, but ended up learning by watching Cartoon Network.. He graduated from University of Central Florida and then went on to earn an MFA from New York University. He was the recipient of the 2018 National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship, which granted him 25,000 dollars in order for him to write, research, and travel. Kalfar describes how Jakub's grandfather in the book resembles his own grandfather, who the book is dedicated to. Kalfar says that as he was writing the book, he kept thinking about his early childhood and a significant event that happened. When he was about 5 or 6 years old, he was taking a walk in the woods late at night with his grandfather and for 2 minutes, his grandfather lost track of him. He remembers \\"this perfect darkness, with nothing but the stars\\" above him, with \\"this perfect silence and just this complete loneliness. That feeling has stayed\\" with him throughout his life. He has used that experience to relate to Jakub and write his story. As for Kalfar's history with literature, in an interview with Writer's Bone, Kalfar shares how he caught the storytelling \\"bug\\" early in his life. \\"My father had an extensive collection of horror and sci-fi videotapes, and those were the gateway to books. I was in awe of how much stories could move and shape a person,\\" Kalfar says. This led him to try writing \\"X-files\\" fan fiction, which eventually led him to write his own original narratives. As for reading, Kalfar's experience with \\"X-file\\" fan fiction led him \\" to exploring the small library of [his] grandparents‚ÄîRobinson Crusoe, any Jules Verne [he] could find. Those were the early days.\\" After that, he discovered Tolkien, Pratchett, and LeGuin in middle school, and eventually began reading more advanced works, such as those of Kundera, Dostoevsky, and Dickens. Kalfar's writing process does not include outlining, but, instead, sitting in silence and allowing himself to \\"hear the characters in [his] head shout over each other.\\" Specifically, his inspiration for \\"Spaceman of Bohemia\\" came from his fascination \\"with loneliness, its contradictions, how people experience it so differently. It seemed like there was no greater place to study loneliness than within the confines of space.\\" However, he wanted to incorporate some politics into his debut novel. Naturally, an astronaut included both. In another interview, Kalfar describes how \\"Spaceman of Bohemia\\" began as a short story. \\"I started writing it right before I came to New York. It was about an American spaceman, astronaut, stranded in orbit while his wife filed for divorce. Short, funny story. While I was in Jonathan Foer‚Äôs class, he asked me why I wasn‚Äôt writing about the Czech Republic. I said I wanted to. That‚Äôs what I wanted to do most. And he said, ‚ÄòWell, the astronaut should be Czech.‚Äô That was when it all clicked.\\" Originally, the main character was an American, with all the stereotypical attributes. Once he applied a different nationality, closer to his own heart, it added \\"depth\\" to the story, as the astronaut had \\"real issues.\\" Once this change was made, the story lengthened; \\"It was because I changed him to something that was close to me and that I really wanted to write about a lot\\".  Plot  Jakub Proch√°zka is a Czech astrophysicist who agrees to an eight-month mission of exploring a cloud of dust and particles, called Chopra, in space that was created by a comet. Jakub must travel to its location (between Earth and Venus) to collect samples of the cloud so they could determine what it is, why it is making the sky purple at night, and why it is beginning to consume itself. The mission is deemed to dangerous by most countries to even attempt, so the Czech Republic decides to take the opportunity to be the first to attempt something like this. It's decided that Jakub will be sent on the mission, making him a celebrity in the public eye. He isn't very passionate about becoming an astronaut, however, instead wanting redemption for his family name. His father was a member of the Communist Party that ruled their country in the past, and a young Jakub and his grandparents were harshly punished for the now deceased father's actions by their community after a stranger revealed his secrets. Jakub feels his family name can only be redeemed by becoming a national hero. Jakub leaves his wife, Lenka, on Earth while he went on this eight-month mission. He continues to talk to her every day over video-call, along with his mission engineer Petr. The stress of the situation coupled with a feeling of abandonment becomes too much for Lenka, and she leaves Jakub. This adds onto Jakub's feeling of extreme loneliness, making is mission almost unbearable. He begins to drink extensively and becomes depressed, and he starts to questions his mental state when he hears voices. After he starts seeing a giant, talking spider walking around the space shuttle, Jakub thinks it is just his imagination or a mental breakdown, but he becomes less sure of this as he continues to see the spider. The spider, which Jakub decides to call Hanu≈°, reveals that he is an alien from another planet and was sent to research humans and their way of life. Jakub passes his time with Hanu≈° and getting reports back from the spy he hired to follow Lenka. When he finally reaches the Chopra, the dust particles tares open his ship and he decides to spend his last moments with a dying Hanu≈°, who he has grown very close to. At the last moment, Jakub is rescued by a Russian shuttle, where he meets three other astronauts. They explain they are from a secret Russian program and that once they lands he will be imprisoned. As they are landing, Jakub escapes with the help of one of the astronauts who claims to have met Hanu≈° as well. This escape attempt causes the ship to crash, which leads to Jakub being the only survivor. He was pronounced dead to the world and decides this is better for both him and Lenka, who he believes is happier without him. He travels back to his childhood home, and where he decides to live the rest of his life.  Characters  Jakub Proch√°zka- The protagonist and narrator of the story. We follow him on his journey to space and back, as well as his memories of his youth. Lenka- Jakub's wife. She leaves him due to the emotional stress and the strain on their relationship created by him going to space. Hanu≈°- A spider- like alien who visits Jakub while he is in space. He uses telepathy to peak into Jakub's memories. As the story progresses, Hanu≈° creates a close bond to Jakub. Jakub's father- Secretly was a torturer for the Soviet Union. His position would lead to the ostracization of Jakub and his grandparents. Jakub's grandfather- A farmer. He is a blunt man, but as his homelife is threatened by the ‚ÄúShoe Man‚Äù he becomes more verbally aggressive. His family is able to keep it from becoming physical. Jakub's grandmother- She seems to be kinder than her husband when it comes to Jakub. Petr- Jakub's mission engineer. Other than Hanu≈°, he seems to be Jakub's closest thing to a friend while he is in space. He is used in the story as Jakub's only link to Lenka, as he feeds him the information after she leaves and helps him find her once he is back on Earth Dr. Ku≈ô√°k- Jakub's psychiatrist. He seems to have a strong interest in Freud's theories. Jakub has a great disliking for him ‚ÄúShoe Man‚Äù- A politician who was tortured and imprisoned in his youth by Jakub's father. He feels Jakub's family owes him for his life being ruined. He also takes an interest in Jakub, keeping an eye on him as he matures Klara- One of the Astronauts sent on a sent on a secret mission to investigate Chopra. She is the kindest to Jakub, leading to him developing an attraction towards her. Vasily- One of the Astronauts sent on a sent on a secret mission to investigate Chopra. He is the only other character other than Jakub to meet Hanu≈°. He, however, believed the alien to be a god and was driven insane. Yuraj- One of the Astronauts sent on a sent on a secret mission to investigate Chopra. He seemed to have more of a sadistic streak  Reception  Jason Heller, a writer for NPR, and Hari Kunzru, a writer for The New York Times, both praise Kalfar's novel for turning the sci-fi genre on its head. Kunzru states that 'Spaceman in Bohemia' does not get hung up explaining some of the more technical aspects of the sci-fi genre, rather the \\"extravagant conceptual furniture\\" that the novel's story sets up are \\"merely metaphors for the human- scale issues that are its main concerns.\\" Kunzru continues, saying of the book, \\"That‚Äôs not to say Kalfar hasn‚Äôt done his research. There are lovingly detailed passages on the mechanics of going to the toilet and cleaning your teeth in orbit, the dangers of muscle wastage and other minutiae of life in zero gravity, but all the whizzy space business is harnessed to the basic question of what it means to leave and whether it‚Äôs possible to come back.\\" Tibor Fischer in The Guardian writes, \\"'Spaceman of Bohemia' should win many fans.

A small brass detonator (German Nr. 8) was inserted into the center of the explosives. pressure on the igniter crushes the glass ampule inside which pours the acid onto the flash powder creating a chemical reaction, which creates a flash that ignites the detonator and explodes the mine.

The show, like all of CMLL's major shows took place in Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico, CMLL's home venue. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2019 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler Blue Demon. This was the 21st March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The main event of the show was a tag team Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, where Los Hermanos Chavez (√Ångel de Oro and Niebla Roja) defeated Los Ingobernables (El Terrible and La Bestia del Ring), which meant that both Los Ingobernables members had to have all their hair shaved off while standing in the middle of the ring. In the semi-main event CMLL World Trios Champions Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Gran Guerrero and √öltimo Guerrero) retained the championship against the team of Car√≠stico, Dragon Lee and Volador Jr. The undercard featured four Six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team matches, including micro-estrella division competitors √Åtomo, El Gallito and Microman defeated Chamuel, Mije and Zacarias el Perico. Production =Background= Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2019 show will be the 25th overall a Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show produced by CMLL. =Storylines= The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The storyline that led to the main event of the 2019 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show started during the 2019 Universal Championship tournament. Both Niebla Roja and El Terrible won their tournament block and faced off in the finals on February 15, 2019. For the match Niebla Roja had his brother, √Ångel de Oro, in his corner while La Bestia del Ring from Los Ingobernables accompanied Terrible for the match. During the match La Bestia helped El Terrible defeat Niebla Roja, leaving to all four wrestlers fighting after the match. On February 19 it was announced that Los Hermanos Chavez (√Ångel and Roja) would face El Terrible and La Bestia del Ring in the main event of the 2019 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, where both teams would \\"bet\\" their hair in a Lucha de Apuestas match. =Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Blue Demon= The mask of Blue Demon is a Wikipedia icon used for some professional wrestling related topics In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\" introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyenda' show and since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. For the 2019 show, CMLL will honor the life and career of Blue Demon as well. Blue Demon, real name Alejandro Mu√±oz Moreno (April 24, 1922 ‚Äì December 16, 2000), was one of the most popular and well-known names in the golden age of Lucha Libre as well as Lucha films, considered one of the \\"big three\\" of the golden age (the other two being El Santo and Mil M√°scaras) and an icon of lucha libre. During his 41-year career, Blue Demon won a number of championships, including the Mexican National Tag Team Championship with Black Shadow, the Mexican National Welterweight Championship three times, and the NWA World Welterweight Championship twice. He was also part of the Class of 1996 inductees in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Mu√±oz' adopted son made his debut as Blue Demon Jr. in 1985, continuing the legacy. CMLL holds a Leyenda de Azul tournament on a semi-regular basis in honor of Blue Demon, with the most recent taking place in 2017. His movie career began in 1961 with La Furia del Ring (The Fury of the Ring) and spanned until 1970 where he starred in Misterio en las Bermudas (Mystery in Bermuda). He would later also be the focus of a 1989 documentary called Blue Demon, el Campe√≥n (Blue Demon, The Champion).

Brunetti, No. 18‚Äì302, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), is a United States Supreme Court case related to the registration of trademarks under the Lanham Act. The Court ruled 6‚Äì3, deciding that the provisions of the Lanham Act prohibiting registration of trademarks of \\"immoral\\" or \\"scandalous\\" matter is unconstitutional, as it permits the United States Patent & Trademark Office to engage in viewpoint discrimination, violating the freedom of speech clause in the First Amendment. Legal background Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, passed in 1946, holds that a trademark may be refused registration by the United States Patent and Trademark Office if the subject consists of \\"immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter\\". Section 2(a) had also held that trademarks may be refused if they were deemed \\"disparaging\\" to individuals or groups, but the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Matal v. Tam (2017) this restriction on \\"disparaging\\" trademarks was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Case background Erik Brunetti started a clothing line with skateboarder Natas Kaupas in 1990 using the name Fuct (stylized as \\"FUCT\\"). Fuct stood as an initialism for \\"Friends U Can‚Äôt Trust\\", but Brunetti felt its phonetic closeness to the expletive \\"fucked\\" was humorous. Around 2010, Brunetti saw a number of knock-offs of his clothing line being sold on eBay and other Internet sites, inappropriately using the \\"Fuct\\" label. In 2011, Brunetti sought to register the trademark on Fuct to stop these knock-offs, but was denied registration by the Office examiner that stated the word was phonetically similar to the expletive \\"fucked\\", which was well-established as a \\"scandalous\\" word under Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act. This decision was upheld by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) in 2014. Brunetti then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The ACLU argued that the Supreme Court had already ruled there was a higher level of scrutiny when the mere display of a potentially offensive word can be regulated from the 1971 case Cohen v. California. In 2017, the Federal Circuit agreed with the TTAB that \\"Fuct\\" would fall under the definition of a \\"scandalous\\" word, not only for its similarity to the vulgar word but also the use of such words in the target youthful market for the clothing line. However, the Federal Circuit also ruled that the restriction against \\"scandalous\\" words of Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act was unconstitutional as it violated Brunetti's rights to free speech, particularly in light of the government failing to take any steps to regulate such speech across the Internet, and reversed the TTAB's holdings. The Federal Circuit referred back to its prior decision and its Supreme Court affirmation in Matal v. Tam related to \\"disparaging\\" trademarks, in that outside of the area of trademarks, such language remains unrestricted as private speech and not government speech. Supreme Court The Patent and Trademark Office, under its director Andrei Iancu, filed for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The Court agreed to hear the case, with oral arguments heard on April 15, 2019. Observers believed a majority of the Justices would favor Brunetti's case and would strike out trademark restrictions on \\"immoral\\" or \\"scandalous\\" material in part due to past inconsistency in the Office's application of the law, with the Office having past approved trademarks on \\"FCUK\\" and \\"FUBAR\\". The Justices raised the question of whether the implied word from \\"Fuct\\" would be considered scandalous to the clothing line's target audience of young adults, but also brought concerns that then the word would appear in advertising, which people outside of this demographic may consider inappropriate speech. The Court did express caution that others may follow suit with trademarking near matches to other well-established vulgar words, and that it should be up to Congress to define a more exacting line that otherwise does not violate the First Amendment. The Court issued its decision on June 24, 2019, affirming the decision of the Federal Circuit Court. The majority opinion was written by Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Kagan wrote that, as the Court had found in Matal v. Tam, that the Office would need to engage in, and has engaged in, \\"viewpoint discrimination\\" to determine if trademark requests fell in to the vague definitions of \\"immoral\\" or \\"scandalous\\". With the Office as a government entity, this would be a violation of First Amendment rights, and thus decided that this portion of the Lanham Act was unconstitutional. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion, pointing out that the Court had to make this decision because of the vagueness of the \\"immoral\\" and \\"scandalous\\" terms in the law, but Congress is empowered to create law that would make a more narrow determination that removed the viewpoint discrimination concern for the Office. Separate opinions, each dissenting in part with the majority, were written by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. The three generally felt that interpreting the \\"immoral\\" aspect of the Lanham Act was difficult, and thus agreed with the majority in striking that portion of the law. However all three felt the \\"scandalous\\" interpretation was not as vague as majority opinion suggested, and that the Office would not be engaging in viewpoint discrimination through this action. The three, along with Alito in his concurring opinion, did express concern that this decision will lead to a flood of new trademarks that would be considered crude, and the creation of public spaces that would be repugnant to some people.

Animation, DC Entertainment, and Nickelodeon. The film is an adaptation of the six-issue inter-company crossover comic book miniseries Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles by James Tynion IV and Freddie Williams II. The story focuses on Batman, Robin and Batgirl teaming up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in order to save Gotham City from chaos at the hands of both Shredder and Ra's al Ghul with their sect: the Foot Clan and the League of Assassins. The film itself features the voices of Troy Baker, Darren Criss, Eric Bauza, Cas Anvar and Andrew Kishino. The film is the first collaboration between Warner Bros. and Nickelodeon, and was devised for the direct-to-video market. It was released on both Blu-ray and Digital HD on June 4, 2019. It achieved positive reviews, and grossed over $3.3 million from home video sales. Plot While touring Powers Industrial, Barbara Gordon witnesses a power generator being stolen by the Foot Clan and also spots four mysterious and elusive creatures during the robbery that she believes are metahumans. She informs Batman, who fights the Foot Clan at Wayne Enterprises before he is defeated by their leader, Shredder. The four \\"metahumans\\" Batgirl sighted are actually the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who have arrived in Gotham to stop the evil Shredder and find out who his new, mysterious ally is. After defending Wayne Enterprises from the Penguin, the Turtles encounter and fight Batman, as each side believes the other is working with the Shredder. The Turtles are forced to retreat when Batman proves to be more experienced in combat. After researching Batman and his reported locations, Donatello manages to lead the Turtles into the Batcave, where they have a brief scuffle with Robin. After Batman and Batgirl arrive, the Turtles introduce themselves and offer their assistance to the Bat-Family when they realize they have the same goal. Robin reveals that Shredder and the Foot Clan are working with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins. In exchange for the use of the Lazarus Pit, Shredder and the Foot Clan aid al Ghul in building a machine that will transform everyone in Gotham into insane mutants using a mixture of mutagen and the Joker's venom. Al Ghul and Shredder break into Arkham Asylum, giving Joker a canister of mutagen in exchange for the formula for his venom. The Bat-Family and the Turtles are alerted of an incident in Arkham by Commissioner Gordon, where they discover that Joker has used the mutagen to transform himself and all of the inmates into mutated animals, including him as a cobra, Mr. Freeze as a polar bear, Scarecrow as a raven, Two-Face as a two-faced cat, Poison Ivy as a venus flytrap, Bane as a jaguar and Harley Quinn as a hyena. The heroes face off against the mutated rogues, but Joker injects Batman with the mutagen/venom combination to transform him into an unhinged mutated vampire bat. After defeating Joker, the heroes use Batgirl and Donatello's retro-mutagen to cure Batman and later the inmates, but realize this was a distraction for Shredder and al Ghul to acquire a Wayne Enterprises cloud seeder they need to complete their machine. As Batman recovers in the Batcave, the two teams find out that their enemies are launching their machine at the Ace Chemicals plant. Batman initially orders the Turtles to leave Gotham due to their impulsiveness, but Raphael convinces him that they are better off working together. As the combined team advances towards Ace Chemicals, they defeat most of the Foot Clan and the League of Assassins' forces before confronting Shredder and al Ghul. Leonardo defeats al Ghul, Batman defeats Shredder, and Donatello and Michelangelo destroy the machine before it activates. The debris from the ensuing explosion knocks Shredder into a vat of Joker venom and detonates the plant. Before the Turtles depart Gotham to return to their master, Batman treats them and the Bat-Family to pizza. In a post-credits scene, Shredder is revealed to have survived the explosion, but was transformed into a monstrous Joker look-alike by the Joker venom.

Schwartau (1926‚Äì1985) was an American recording engineer. He engineered artists such as Ray Charles, Peter, Paul & Mary, Bill Evans, Herbie Mann and Duke Ellington. Schwartau was a mentor to engineer Phil Ramone, who called Schwartau \\"one of the unsung heroes of our industry\\". Schwartau worked for NBC, Decca, Coastal Recording Studio (which dissolved in 1959), and Music Makers.  Education  Schwartau started MIT in 1942. He pledged with the Phi Kappa fraternity and was expected to graduate in 1946.  Military service  Schwartau served in the US Navy. He was given a leave of absence in 1944. In 1945, he was promoted to Radio Technician (RT 3/C). He returned in 1946 after serving as an Electronic Technician's Mate (ETM 2/C) on the USS John A. Bole. At that time, the destroyer was patrolling near China, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea. According to his son, Winn, Schwartau worked on developing the oscilloscope and on radar systems in the military.  Career  Schwartau worked for NBC in 1942 in Guest Relations. After serving in the military, he joined NABET (the broadcasting union) in 1949 and started working at NBC in 1950. He was with Decca Records (start date unknown) until later 1953. He was working at Coastal Recording when he was appointed Chief Engineer at A&R; Recording in New York in December 1958 (Phil Ramone was a co-founder). The first major album recorded at the studio was The Genius of Ray Charles, which was engineered by Tom Dowd and Schwartau with Phil Ramone as \\"third assistant.\\" Ramone said of Schwartau in his autobiography, \\"Bill Schwartau was one of the unsung heroes of our industry, and every recording professional on the East Coast admired him. His ability to hear 'through the microphone' was impeccable; and when Bill set up a session, what you heard in the studio matched what you heard in the control room. He used microphones and aural shading to convey subtlety and nuance in the same way a painter uses light and color.\\" In 1959, Scwartau was hired as sound engineer at Music Makers \\"to attempt to crack the obstacles of poor sound transfers in commercial prints. It was announced he was promoted to Vice President of production at Music Makers in 1960. In 1962, he was named production supervisor and chief engineer of Sound Maker's Studio. He also engineer the influential jazz album Money Jungle with Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Max Roach.  Personal life  Not long after he started working at NBC (in 1950), he met engineer Mary Caroline Bell. The two married six weeks later. Since that wasn't allowed by the company, Mary was reassigned to the 4th floor (where she was the broadcast engineer and editor for the nightly news). The two were only married five years but had a son, Winn Schwartau. Winn says he was editing tapes at their home studio when he was 5 years old. He married Carolyn Leibersberger in 1958.

It began with an inspection station- warehouse, a ferry, a dam and a flour mill, all built by Thomas Cocke and Nicolos Clayton Davies of Bedford County, Virginia. It was a booming town during its day due to its proximity to the James River. It eventually grew to include a modest hotel with a ballroom, a tavern, a lumber house, and several homes. Its remoteness and the death of the canal system in the 1870s killed the town, though the ferry continued to operate into the 20th century. Bethel, or Salt Creek Ferry First known as Davies Lower Ferry, established in the 1770s in Bedford County, Virginia. There was a Lewis Davies Ferry in 1774. Also, known as Lewis Davies Fishing Shore in 1882 (Bedford Ct. Order). Bennet A. Crawford advertised in the Lynchburg Press 11/2/1821 to rent Bethel Ferry. In 1864 during the American Civil War, General John D. Imboden crossed at this point of the river to reach Lynchburg, Virginia to repel Hunter's Advance. In 1881, the Richmond and Alleghany Railroad paid Edward Fletcher for privileges to use the ferry. Fletcher had purchased Bethel Ferry from Samuel L. Wortham (Amherst Deed NN p. 70). An iron screw eye fastened into rock can be seen where the ferry once crossed. The railroad may have changed operation of this ferry to the Bedford side of the river, known as Abert, Virginia.

Angel's first well known short is \\"Oga Landlord,\\" wherein a man late on rent (Angel) is trying to hide from his landlord (Daddy Humble), and tries in vain to have a child (Emmanuella) cover for him (e.g. \\"My uncle is not around. He just told me.\\"). Samuel is Angel's longest-appearing actress. She has won comedy awards in Nigeria and Australia for her work with Angel, and is Africa's youngest YouTube award winner. She started film work in school as part of a class video project, prior to being chosen by Angel for his stable of actors. Samuel's videos can reach up to a million views during the first week after posting. Mark Angel Comedy received a plaque from YouTube for having reached one million subscriptions in 2017. It was the first Nigerian-based YouTube channel to reach that threshold. In 2018 it was announced that Samuel would be attached to an upcoming Disney feature film. On 2 April, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, Emmanuella, Success, and Regina Daniels were featured in a skit by Ofego titled \\"Lockdown\\" on his YouTube channel, using archive footage.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S46iwCmoGv0  Film style  Mark Angel works mostly with multiple camera formats and close camera angles. Filming sometimes includes shaky camera techniques to give them a natural and down to earth feel, something Angel calls \\"freestyle comedy.\\" Angel primarily films within his family's lower-class neighbourhood in Port Harcourt, as a means to portray the environment he grew up in and relate to other common people in Nigeria.

Washington Half Dollar was designed by Isaac Scott Hathaway. The obverse depicts side-portraits of George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington and the reverse shows a simple outline map of the United States of America superimposed with the letters \\"U.S.A.\\", and the words \\"Freedom and Opportunity for All/Americanism\\" around the rim. It was minted in silver from 1951 until 1954, by authority of . It was the final issue of early commemoratives. History The bill authorizing the coins was pushed by the George Washington Carver National Monument Foundation, and eventually passed on September 21, 1951, authorizing the mintage of a maximum 3,415,631 coins. This odd maximum mintage number took into consideration the remaining 1,581,631 Booker T. Washington half dollars that could be melted and struck as Washington-Carver coins, with the remainder being based on the 1,834,000 unused quantity earlier authorized for the Booker T. Washington half dollar. Like the Booker T. Washington half dollar, the design for this coin was created by sculptor Isaac Scott Hathaway. One of the reasons behind the Carver-Washington half dollar may have possibly been to oppose the spread of Communism among African Americans. One of Hathaway's early designs for the coin featured a three quarter profile portrait of Booker T. Washington behind the profile portrait of George Washington Carver on the obverse, while the reverse featured the American Legion seal with inscriptions such as \\"United Against the Spread of Communism.\\" The coin would be produced for the following three years. They were often sold in three-coin sets (one coin for each mint mark), although large quantities of the 1951, 1952, 1953-S and 1954-S coins were struck for sale as singles. The sets were sold for between $9 and $10 each, although this would later be raised to $12 per set for the 1954 coins. In 1952, an attempt was made to issue the coins through banks. By the time the program ended in 1954, over a million coins had been distributed. Aftermath Despite being the last early commemorative issue, little attention was paid when the program ended in 1954, as by this point most American coin collectors had become bored with commemorative coins. Owing to the fact that the Booker T. Washington and Washington-Carver Halves were little desired at that time, thousands of those coins were returned to the Mint for melting, while thousands more still held by banks were sold to speculators for a small premium (usually pennies) above face value. Until the George Washington 250th Anniversary Commemorative Half Dollar was issued 28 years later, in 1982, no more commemorative coins would be issued by the United States (not counting the circulating commemorative United States Bicentennial coinage). Any subsequent commemorative coin proposals were met by the Treasury Department with the long list of complaints that had arisen due to past abuses, such as the 1936 commemorative craze.

It was created by Gina H√§u√üge who initially developed the software to support her first 3D printer in 2012. OctoPrint was forked from Cura, and is available under the same AGPL license. Development is hosted on GitHub. OctoPrint development was financially supported by the Spanish smartphone manufacturer BQ beginning in August 2014. When BQ discontinued support in April 2016, H√§u√üge turned to Patreon. As of February 2019, crowdfunding through Patreon was responsible for providing over $6000 per month from over 1500 backers to H√§u√üge. OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling 3D printers, allowing the user to start a print job by sending G-code to a 3D printer connected via USB. OctoPrint monitors the status of the print job, as well as the printer itself, primarily the temperature of the print head (hot end) and the temperature of the bed, if the bed on the printer is heated. OctoPrint can also show the output of a connected webcam in order to monitor the state of the print, and can visualize the G-code in sync with the print job, or asynchronously. OctoPrint also provides a plugin system, allowing users to extend functionality. There are currently over 150 plugins listed in the official plugin repository. These include advanced timelapse videos that trigger by layer and position the model and print head properly, 3D design collection sites such as MyMiniFactory, STL.garden, integrating OctoPrint with Android apps and Android Wear modules, a Pebble smartwatch,, software integrations with printers such as BigBox3D, MakerGear M3, and Robo 3D printers, and both software and hardware integrations with Prusa i3, Proforge 2S, and the industrial-level GEWO HTP 260 and AON3D printers. It has also been used by Thomas Sanladerer in a PrintrBot as a self-contained and fully mobile printer build. OctoPrint can run on a variety of systems, but is commonly run on Raspberry Pi. A distribution called OctoPi, based on the Raspbian OS for Raspberry Pi, provides a pre-configured version of OctoPrint along with an mjpeg-streamer support for webcams. OctoPrint recommends using the Raspberry Pi 3B and specifically warns against using the Raspberry Pi Zero W due to severe performance issues observed. In September 2018, a vulnerability was publicized at the Internet Storm Center of SANS Institute because \\"thousands\\" of users misconfigured their OctoPrint interface so it was available to the Internet without a login. This could result in not only a loss of data (intellectual property of designs) and privacy (through a connected webcam), but literal fires from poorly designed 3D printer safety controls. Solutions that still enable worldwide access to a printer include using a commercial cloud printing interface like AstroPrint or Polar Cloud, as well as the OctoPrint Anywhere plugin or standard VPN installations. Starting with OctoPrint version 1.4.0 released on March 4, 2020, OctoPrint is compatible with Python 3.

Worth controlled, beat, stabbed, starved and tortured Skeel, leaving him with severed tendons, fluid on the brain and burns. She also prevented him from receiving medical treatment for injuries she inflicted. Worth became the first woman to be convicted of the United Kingdom's coercive control offence and in 2018 was jailed for a total of seven and half years for her crimes. Skeel has been interviewed numerous times in the media about the abuse he suffered and his story was told in a BBC Three documentary Abused By My Girlfriend which was first shown in February 2019. He is an Ambassador for domestic violence charity The ManKind Initiative. Early life Skeel was born prematurely on 17 August 1995 along with his twin brother. Weighing just two pounds, he was placed in intensive care and underwent multiple operations as a baby. They lived in Putnoe, north of Bedford. The twins were child models for supermarket chain Asda. Relationship with Worth Skeel and Jordan Worth met at college in 2012 when they were both aged 16. Worth, previously a gymnast, later attended the University of Hertfordshire, obtaining a degree in Fine Arts; she wanted to become a teacher. At the age of eighteen Worth became pregnant with their first child, a son, and after his birth the couple moved to Stewartby. They broke up in June 2017. Domestic abuse Worth's abuse had begun early in the relationship, controlling which clothes Skeel wore and assaulting him. Skeel was isolated from his family, with Worth sending messages from his phone telling them not to contact him anymore. She then broke his mobile phone and took over his social media accounts, setting up a Facebook account in his name which she controlled. She falsely told Skeel that his grandfather had died, and then berated him for caring about his family for crying about the news. The abuse escalated, with coercive control deemed to have occurred between April 2016 to June 2017.

More than 20,000 people attended, and Fritz Julius Kuhn was a featured speaker. The Bund billed the event, which took place 2 days before George Washington's Birthday, as a pro-\\"Americanism\\" rally; the stage at the event featured a huge Washington portrait with swastikas on each side. Background Rally poster The German American Bund was a pro-Hitler organization in the United States before World War II. The group promoted Nazi propaganda in the United States, combining Nazi imagery with American patriotic imagery. The largely decentralized Bund was active in a number of regions, but attracted support only from a minority of German Americans.Eli Lederhendler, American Jewry: A New History (Cambridge University Press, 2017), p. 230. The Bund was the most influential of a number of pro-Nazi German groups in the United States in the 1930s; others included the Teutonia Society and Friends of New Germany (also known as the Hitler Club). Alongside allied groups, such as the Christian Front, these organizations were virulently antisemitic. The pro-Nazi organizations in the U.S. were actively countered by anti-Nazi organizations led by American Jews, Americans, and others who opposed Hitlerism and supported a boycott of German goods. The Joint Boycott Committee held a rally at Madison Square Garden in 1937. Preparation for rally Mayor LaGuardia realized the dangers posed by this rally and dispatched the highest number of police to a single event in the city's history. 1,700 uniformed police officers patrolled outside the venue as well as 600 undercover detectives and non-uniformed officers scattered throughout the hall, and even 35 firefighters, armed with a heavy- duty fire hose in preparation of a riot. Bomb squads also combed the arena in response to a threat received a week earlier, boasting of a series of time activated devices to explode during the event. \\"Bund Rally Bomb Rumor Fails to Worry Mayor,\\" New York Times, February 21, 1939. New York was ready for the influx of Nazi ralliers and was prepared to protect their guaranteed rights at all costs. Chief Inspector Louis F. Costuma illustrated this commitment to safety, telling the press, \\"We had enough police here to stop a revolution' in an interview in preparation for the rally.\\" Bernstien, Arnie, Swastika Nation, Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund, (New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2013) While Madison Square Garden had prepared itself for the German Bund, many around New York City considered the Nazi sect less welcome in their city. About 100,000 anti-Nazi protesters gathered around the arena in protest of the Bund, carrying signs stating \\"Smash Anti-Semitism\\" and \\"Drive the Nazis Out of New York.\\"Bernstien, Arnie, Swastika Nation, Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund, (New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2013) A total of three attempts were made to break the arm- linking lines of police, the first of these, a group of World War One Veterans, wrapped in Stars and Stripes, were held off by police on mounted horseback, the next, a 'burly man carrying an American flag' and finally, a Trotskyites group known as the Socialist Workers Party, who like those before, had their efforts halted by police. Chief Inspector Costuma's Police force acting security was exposed to an odd form of protest as well, characterized by the New York Times as: \\"One of the most mystifying disturbances came from a blaring speaker set up in a second-floor room of a rooming house at the southern corner of Forty-ninth Street and Eight Avenue. Shortly before 8 o'clock it began blaring out a denunciation of Nazis and urging \\"Be American, Stay at Home.\\" Upon investigation, the room was found untenanted: the voice of these 'denunciations' came from a record, timed to go off at 7:55pm. Full of dramatics, the night's main act saw Joseph Goldstien, a former New York magistrate, exit a taxi cab in front of the rally holding a summons for the arrest of Fritz Julius Kuhn in relation to a criminal libel suit filed earlier. Goldstien, like all other opposing efforts to gain admittance to the Garden, was stopped by police, this time Inspector Costuma himself, denying the former magistrate entry based on the failure to present a ticket. \\"Record Detail of 1,700 Cuts off the Area to Protesters - Thousands in Vicinity\\" New York Times, Tuesday, February 21st. As the night went on, outside Madison Square Garden, a total of 13 people were arrested in protest of the rally. Their names, ages, charges and sentences (if available) are included below: *Isadore Greenbaum (26) - disorderly conduct (rushing the stage) - $25 fine *John Doe (Fred Ryde) - disorderly conduct - $2 fine *Lawerence Paladri - disorderly conduct - $2 fine *Peter Saunders (34) - disorderly conduct and cruelty to animals (lunged on a mounted officer) *George Mason (19) - yelled 'keep the Nazi's out of New York' - $10 fine *Stephen Carmalt (20) - disorderly conduct - suspended sentence *Robert Lee (39) - disorderly conduct - $10 fine *J Walter Flynn (32) - $10 fine *Michael Naradich (26) - disorderly conduct *Peter Shopes (22) - disorderly conduct *Lionel Sheppard (26) - disorderly conduct *Abe Dollinger (27) - disorderly conduct *Enfrim Lidew (50) - disorderly conduct Rally The rally took place at a time when the German American Bund's membership was dropping; Kuhn hoped that a provocative high- profile event would reverse the group's declining fortunes.Bradley W. Hart, Hitler's American Friends: The Third Reich's Supporters in the United States (St. Martin's/Dunne, 2018). The pro-Nazi Bund was unpopular in New York City, and some called for the event to be banned. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia allowed the event to go forward, correctly predicting that the Bund's highly publicized spectacle would further discredit them in the public eye. The event was highly choreographed in the fascist style, with uniformed Bund members carrying American and Nazi flags, the display of the Nazi salute, and the playing of martial music and German folk songs. The rally began at 8pm with a rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", sung by Margarete Rittershaush. Next, James Wheeler-Hill, national secretary of the Bund, opened the night with the statement that \\"if George Washington were alive today, he would be friends with Adolf Hitler.\\"\\"Free America!\\" The German American Bund at Madison Square Garden, February 20, 1939. Speeches by J. Wheeler-Hill, Rudolf Marman, George Froboese, Hermann Schwinn, G. William Kunze, and the Bund Fuehrer: Fritz Kuhn Calling upon his fellow Americans, Wheller-Hill preached challenged Bund members to restore America to the 'True Americans' while condemning President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes for attacking Nazi officials. Midwestern Gau leader, George Froboese was next to speak, pushing themes of 'Jewish world domination' blaming the 'oriental cunning of the Jew Karl Marx-Mordecais for the class warfare felt across the country.'\\"Free America!\\" The German American Bund at Madison Square Garden, February 20, 1939. Speeches by J. Wheeler-Hill, Rudolf Marman, George Froboese, Hermann Schwinn, G. William Kunze, and the Bund Fuehrer: Fritz Kuhn West Coast leader, Hermann Schwinn chose to denounce the Jewish control of Hollywood and news industries, following a common theme of the night with a fantastically anti-semitic run-on sentence, \\"Everything inimical to those Nations which have freed themselves of alien domination is 'News' to be played up and twisted to fan the flames of hate in the hearts of Americans, whereas the Menace of Anti-National, Gold-Hating Jewish-Bolshevism, is deliberately minimized\\"\\"Free America!\\" The German American Bund at Madison Square Garden, February 20, 1939. Speeches by J. Wheeler-Hill, Rudolf Marman, George Froboese, Hermann Schwinn, G. William Kunze, and the Bund Fuehrer: Fritz Kuhn Last to speak, the Bundersfuhrer himself, Fritz Kuhn continued to push the anti-Semitic theme, going as far as to refer to President Roosevelt as 'Rosenfield' and the man to which he promised to make no anti-Semitic remarks, Fiorello \\"Jew Lumpen\\" LaGuardia himself.\\"Free America!\\" The German American Bund at Madison Square Garden, February 20, 1939. Speeches by J. Wheeler-Hill, Rudolf Marman, George Froboese, Hermann Schwinn, G. William Kunze, and the Bund Fuehrer: Fritz Kuhn All came to an immediate halt as in the middle of Kuhn's final speech, a man dressed in blue broke through the lines of OD men and ran onto the stage and charged at the speaker. Quickly swarmed by the Ordnungsdienst, he was subdued in an effective routine of punches and stomps exemplifying an 'uncanny replication of Nazi thuggery' [as] a pack of uniformed men blaste[ed] away with fists and boots on a lone Jewish victim.\\"Maloney Russel, \\"Heil Washington!\\" The New Yorker, April 4, 1939 Later identified as 26-year-old plumbing assistant Isadore Greenbaum, the lone victim was pulled away by a team of police, saving the young man from serious injury. Attempting to control the riled-up crowd, Kuhn delivered his rousing finish, advocating for an America ruled by White Gentiles, free from a Jewish Hollywood and news. \\"The Bund is open to you, provided you are sincere, of good character, of White Gentile Stock, and an American Citizen imbued with patriotic zeal. Therefore: Join!\\" As Kuhn exited the stage, 20 thousand Bund members chanted \\"Free America! Free America! Free America!\\" in the biggest Nazi rally in United States history. At 11:15, members of the Bund buttoned up their overcoats, conveniently hiding their uniforms, and were escorted through police lines along Fifty-Second amid the crowds of protesters waiting outside. Ralliers were greeted with a roar of catcalls, jeers, and even a few punches, but by midnight, all was quiet, or as quiet as it could be in downtown New York. Isadore Greenbaum never intended to run onto the stage. A former deck engineer and chief petty officer, Greenbaum snuck into the rally, but his anger quickly took hold of him as he listened to Kuhn speak. Speaking years later in 1989, Greenbaum characterized his actions as \\"I went down to the Garden without any intention of interrupting, but being that they talked so much against my religion and there was so much persecution I lost my head and I felt it was my duty to talk\\". Bump Philip, \\"When Nazis rallied in Manhattan, one Working-Class Jewish Man From Brooklyn Took Them on\\" The Washington Post, February 20, 2019. When asked about the cause of his actions, Greenbaum quickly rebutted with \\"Gee, what would you have done if you were in my place listening to that s.o.b. hollering against the government and publicly kissing [Adolf] Hitler's behind - while thousands cheered? Well, I did it.\\" Bump Philip, \\"When Nazis rallied in Manhattan, one Working-Class Jewish Man From Brooklyn Took Them on\\" The Washington Post, February 20, 2019. For his actions in disturbing the biggest Nazi rally in the United States, Greenbaum was sentenced to 10 days in jail, but instead paid a $25 fine. Bump Philip, \\"When Nazis rallied in Manhattan, one Working-Class Jewish Man From Brooklyn Took Them on\\" The Washington Post, February 20, 2019. Aftermath Shortly after the rally, the Bund rapidly declined. Two months after the rally, the film Confessions of a Nazi Spy was released by Warner Brothers, ridiculing the Nazis and their American sympathizers. The Bund also came under investigation. After its financial records were seized in a raid on the group's Yorkville, Manhattan headquarters, authorities discovered that $14,000 (about $250,000 in 2018 dollars) raised by the Bund in the rally was unaccounted for, having been spent by Kuhn on his mistress and various personal expenses. Kuhn was convicted of embezzlement in December 1939 and sent to Sing Sing prison. Kuhn's successor as Bund leader was Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, a spy for German military intelligence who fled the United States in November 1941. The final Bund national leader was George Froboese, who was in charge of the organization when Germany declared war on the United States. Froboese committed suicide in 1942, after receiving a federal grand jury subpoena. The rally was featured in Frank Capra's wartime documentary series Why We Fight. Actual footage of the rally was incorporated into a fictional newsreel created for the 2004 Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Storm Front,\\" illustrating an alternate history in which the Nazis invaded and occupied the United States with the help of aliens from the future. The short 2017 documentary film A Night at the Garden is about the rally.

N. Kapur (December 1910 - March 1994), was an Indian educator. He served as Principal of Modern School, New Delhi, for thirty years. For his contribution to the field of education, he received the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 1969.  Early life  M. N. Kapur was born on 10 December 1910 in Gujranwala in Western Punjab, now in Pakistan. After a spell of home schooling, he completed his matriculation from American Mission School, Gujranwala. He studied at Government College, Lahore, where, apart from academics, he made a mark as a sportsman in the disciplines of association football, boxing and swimming. He obtained his Master's degree in physics in 1932..  Career  Kapur started his career as a teacher in 1933, in Mayo College, Ajmer. In 1936, he went to the University of London for further training in education. In 1947, upon the retirement of Kamala Bose, the founder-principal of Modern School, the management instituted a search for her successor. M. N. Kapur was chosen despite his young age. Sardar Bhagwant Singh, a member of the management, had this to say: \\"On just going through the bio-data of the applicants we all thought to ourselves - the cheek of this young man to apply for the post of the Principal of Modern School! But when this young man walked into the room all of us were impressed with Mr Kapur's personality and bearing. ...\\" After the interviews, the selection committee \\"... had no hesitation in saying that Mr Kapur would be the best choice for the post ...\\" Kapur took charge of Modern School in the turbulent times following the Independence of India and its Partition. He remained Principal for the next three decades, until his retirement in 1977. The Padma Shri was conferred on him in 1969. In 1980, Gyan Bharati School was set up in Saket, New Delhi. Kapur contributed to its vision and took charge as its founder-Principal.  Legacy  During Kapur's long tenure, Modern School came to be recognised as one of the leading schools of India. Personally, he was a mentor to many students at Modern and also at Gyan Bharati. The emphasis he laid on overall development of the personality, and not academic achievement alone, has endured. To celebrate his birth centenary, Modern School Old Students' Association organised a series of events in 2010-2011. A documentary film, titled Dhruvtara (Pole Star), has been made on M. N. Kapur.

The film features an original score by James Gelfand and Louise Tremblay. Plot Left for dead after a brutal interrogation apparently gone wrong, vice detective Anna Walker (Elisabeth R√∂hm) awakes in the hospital with no memory of who she is. She recognizes no-one; not her husband Tate (Neil Napier), her daughter Emily (Vivien Endicott-Douglas), nor Derek (Tygh Runyan), her partner on the police force, who tells her most of the rest of the force is occupied with solving the recent murder of the mayor, her own assault being less of a priority. On her return home Anna discovers that hers is not a happy family: her relationship with Emily was extremely strained; Anna herself was on the verge of leaving Tate. She has other problems brewing: whoever assaulted her may want to finish the job, if her memory returns. A visit from Internal Affairs suggests some on the force may think she is faking her amnesia and has something to hide. Elisabeth R√∂hm in 2012 Not knowing whom to trust, she must find out who may still be pursuing her, before they eliminate her once and for all. Anna begins an investigation of her own immediate past and discovers she was callous and competitive enough to put her job above her family and was having an affair with Derek, who helps her with her investigation. The more she learns, the more she wants to put right whatever went wrong in her life. She and Derek were on the take. Her investigations lead to realize she had found a safe house for a witness to the mayor's murder, a young prostitute. Eventually, she works out that the only safe place for her was her father's house, and, going there, she unwittingly leads the killer's gang to the safe house, as Derek betrays her. She has no choice but to return with him and the young woman, as the gang leader has her husband and daughter hostage...

Jim McLennan finds R√∂hm \\"okay\\", and is impressed by the opening sequence which is \\"surprisingly brutal, given the medium and origins\\", but the script does not manage \\"to live up to the toughness with which it begins.\\" > In other hands, the general scenario might have made for an interesting > study: how a sudden, externally triggered change in someone‚Äôs character > affects them and those around them. However, the film instead chooses to > wander off in a number of far less successful directions. Andy Webb, who points out that Elisabeth R√∂hm previously played a woman with amnesia in the 2009 TV film Desperate Escape, finds the story is \\"never gripping enough\\" despite its \\"decent idea\\"; unfortunately, \\"the execution of it fails to do it justice\\" and \\"lengthy build up\\" feels \\"a bit drawn out.\\" On a German TV film review site, R√∂hm is described as unenthusiastic in her role, which the site ascribes to a predictable script; as well, the direction and photography appear amateurish. The Radio Times assigned the film 2 out of 5 stars. =Nominations=2016 Canadian Screen Awards Best TV Movie or Limited Series Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Limited Series Best Writing in a Dramatic Program or Limited Series *Directors Guild of Canada (2015) Direction - Television Movie/Mini-Series (DGC Craft Award) *Sichuan Television Festival (2015) Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television References External linksOfficial trailer on YouTube *Forget and Forgive on IMDb 2014 films Canadian films 2014 thriller drama films Canadian thriller drama films Films about amnesia Canadian television films 2014 drama films ","title":"Forget and Forgive"},{"id":"60024939","text":"Paige Nicole Parker (born January 24, 1996) is an American softball player and current volunteer assistant coach at Oklahoma.

This film was released on 15 March 2019 under the banner of RP Techvision India Private Limited. Bengali Actor- Director Shri Kaushik Ganguly plays the Titular role and music direction of the film was made by Kabir Suman. Plot This is a story of a small suburban locality of the Metro City Kolkata named Goragacha. The neighbourhood or in Bengali Para consists of a small grocery shop, run by its owner Shankar, a barber, a tea stall, a ladies tailor, a gents tailor and a local auto rickshaw driver. Amongst locals, there are a political leader or dada, a family whose only young youth was actively engaged in politics and subsequently died in a police encounter, a teacher, a live-in frustrated son-in-law and a Bahurupi. The story started with affectionate bondage between people in that big joint family like para, which slowly faced the fear of being extinct due to their financial stringency. As a part of advanced civilized modernisation which was an obvious effect of globalisation, a shopping mall emerged in their locality. Local residents slowly get accustomed with the central AC comfort, wide range of products, promotional techniques, acceptance of digital payments etc. of the local shopping mall which put a strong and uneven challenge of survival to local small scale business owners. They were losing their livelihood very fast. Shankar tried to cope-up with \\"mall effects\\" like keeping packet food grains, home delivery, introducing utility bill payments, even installing stand blower fan for his customers who' in his version' his God. But all his and the entire neighbourhood's struggle gone in vain. Some leave, someone compromised their chastity, someone committed suicide after being defeated in this life struggle for survival. The plot clearly pinpoints the obvious negative impact of globalisation without having constructive governmental planning for saving medium or small scale businesses.

An amphitheater and multi-purpose studios for art, movement, and cooking are included. A collection of 52 tractors are on display at various locations in the facility. History Planning for JUMP began in 1999 as a museum of agriculture sponsored by Boise agribusiness magnate J. R. Simplot. The museum would include some of the 150 pieces of farm equipment Simplot had purchased in 1998 from the collection of Oscar O. Cooke. The plan evolved into a creative facility, and after Simplot's death in 2008, the J.R. Simplot Family Foundation proposed building a $100 million park and museum with studio space and meeting facilities; city planners rejected the idea as incompatible with development goals. The foundation proposed a combined museum and new main library, but again the plan was rejected. In 2012, city planners approved construction of a $70 million facility that included an urban park, a building, and the tractor exhibit. More than three years after groundbreaking, Jack's Urban Meeting Place opened in December 2015. Architecture The architectural firm of Adamson Associates designed JUMP with five intersecting grid patterns, with components of a 6-story main building slightly skewed around a central ramp area in the parking garage.

The estate was a royal fief until the middle of the 18th century and was later owned by the Moltke family at Bregentved from 1751 to 1937. The current main building is from 1849. The Tryggev√¶lde Runestone was from some time during the 16th century to 1810 located in the central courtyard of the old main building. History =Crown land, 1355‚Äì1670= The name Tryggev√¶lde is first mentioned in 1261. The next time it is mentioned is in 1355 when the brothers Bent, Jon and Esbern Grubbe ceded it to Valdemar IV. They had most likely inherited it from their father, Bo Jensen Grubbe, who had been killed on his way home from the Holy Land in 1349. The brothers had also inherited Alslevgaard which would remain in the hands of the family for more than 300 years. Tryggev√¶lde was then managed as a royal fief until 1670. Chancellor Evert Grubbe was lensmann of Tryggev√¶lde from 1470 to 1489. He was succeeded by Christian Nielsen Dyre (1503-1505) and Gunde Hansen Lange, but then it returned to the Grubbe family. In 1568, Tryggev√¶lde was incorporated in the Fief of Copenhagen (K√∏benhavns Len). In 1672 it was again disjoined from the Fief of Copenhagen and expanded with several estates and former church land. The new lensmann of Tryggev√¶lde was Eiler Grubbe, Chancellor of the Realm. He was after his death in 1585 succeeded by Arild Huitfeldt. He relocated to Vordingborg Castle in 1596 and later to Dragsholm. =Changing owners= In 1670, Tryggev√¶lde was sold to Otte Skeel. His son, Christen Skeel, bought the smaller manor of Alslevgaard and converted it into a tenant farm under Tryggev√¶lde. In 1710, Tryggev√¶lde was acquired by Peder Benzon. He ceded it to the crown two years later in exchange for Vibyg√•rd and it was then included in one of the 12 cavalry districts. In 1747, Tryggev√¶lde was sold to Peter Johansen Neergaard, =The Moltke family= LAdam Gottlob Moltke In 1751, Tryggev√¶lde was acquired by Adam Gottlob Moltke. He had the previous year established the Countship of Bregentved but Tryggev√¶lde (with Alslevgaard) remained an unentailed estate. The Countship of Bregentved was as a result of the lensafl√∏sningsloven dissolved in 1922 and Count Moltke was in the same time required to pay a special tax to the government. 16 smallholdings was in this connection sold off in lots to raise the necessary money for the tax. =The Lemvigh family= Aage Lemvigh, the owner of A. C. Lemvigh-M√ºller, purchased the remains of the Tryggev√¶lde estate from Moltke in 1937. He was in 1959 succeeded by his son Axel J√∏rn Lemvigh. He passed it on to his son J√∏rn Lemvigh. Architecture The main building is from 1849. The facade features a gabled median risalit. The Tryggev√¶lde Runestone was for hundreds of years situated in the courtyard of the old main building. It was probably brought to the site from a local hilltop by one of the king's vasals some time during the 16th century. In 1810, it was moved to a site in the former graveyard next to Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen. It is now located in the National Museum.

P√°sztor won four Hungarian national championships as a player, and was a member of the Hungary men's national ice hockey team. He later served as president of the Hungarian Ice Sports Association, helped establish the Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation, and was a member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. He was a delegate to the International Ice Hockey Federation, and was chairman of its medical committee for 12 years, overseeing tests for doping in sport. P√°sztor is inducted into both the IIHF Hall of Fame, and the Hungarian Ice Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and is referred to as \\"Mr. Hockey\\" in his native Hungary. Early life and education P√°sztor was born 2 March 1923, in T√∂r√∂kb√°lint, Kingdom of Hungary. He learned how to skate by gliding around frozen ponds as a youth, and improvised his skates by strapping blades to the bottom of his shoes. He began playing ice hockey in 1933 at age 10, while attending Fasori Gimn√°zium in Budapest. He practiced with the school for 90 minutes every day at the City Park Ice Rink. He won the high school championship with Fasori in 1937, and later graduated in 1941. Hockey playing career P√°sztor joined the Hungary junior men's national ice hockey team at age 17, and played with the team in Garmisch-Partenkirchen during 1940, at a winter sports week event held in lieu of the cancelled 1940 Winter Olympics. He played for the Hungary men's national ice hockey team during a span of 18 years from 1941 to 1959. Due to socialist politics in the 1950s, he was limited to travel within other Eastern Bloc countries, which amounted to only six or seven international games during that time. P√°sztor won six Hungarian national championship titles during his playing career. He played the forward position, and was a player-coach for several seasons. He played for the Budapest Skating Club from 1941 to 1944, winning his first national championship in the 1943‚Äì44 season. His playing career was interrupted during World War II, and resumed with the hockey team at Csepel SC during the 1948‚Äì49 season. He later played the 1949‚Äì50 season with Mallerd, and continued with the same team when it was renamed Meteor Mallerd for the 1950‚Äì51 season. The team changed names again, and P√°sztor played with Red Meteor from 1951 to 1959. He won three national championships with Red Meteor in 1952, 1957 and 1959. P√°sztor later said that one of his favorite memories of playing was the 1959 Hungarian championship, when he scored the winning goal with 18 seconds remaining in the game versus D√≥zsa √öjpest. He finished his playing career as a player-coach with Builders in the 1959‚Äì60 season. Hungarian sports leader P√°sztor became the players' representative on the board of directors for the Hungarian Ice Sports Association in 1957, which oversaw hockey and other ice sports. He served as president of that association from 1963 until 1988, when he helped establish the independent Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation (HIHF), and then served as vice-president of the new organization until 1994. He felt that to improve ice hockey in Hungary, a stronger national league was needed, which required more youths, more arenas, and proper leadership. When the HIHF historical committee decided to establish a national ice hockey museum, P√°sztor was asked to be a consultant. P√°sztor was a radio reporter for Hungary at the 1972 Summer Olympics, and became a member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee in 1989. He also served as the manager of the Hungarian national men's ice hockey team at the 2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, when Hungary won the gold medal in its division. International hockey service P√°sztor was the first person to represent Hungary at the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) meetings, and served as his country's delegate from 1959 to 1982. He was chosen for the role due to his ability to speak English and German, the dominant languages in Europe at the time. His first international duties were attending the 1959 Ice Hockey World Championships in Prague, on behalf of Hungary. He later began serving as a member of the IIHF medical committee in 1971. From 1982 to 1994, he served in the dual role of being an IIHF executive council member, and as the chairman of the medical committee to oversee doping in sport. When the testing for doping in sport was first introduced, he thought that ice hockey would not be deeply affected, but later said that notion was a mistake. He also served on the board for the IIHF European Champions Cup during this time. During his tenure with the IIHF, P√°sztor had been involved in 45 Ice Hockey World Championships, and seven Winter Olympic Games. Awards and honors P√°sztor retired from international hockey duty in 1994, and was made an honorary member of the IIHF in the same year. In 2001, he was inducted into the builder category of the IIHF Hall of Fame in Toronto. He was the first Hungarian so honored by the IIHF, and was later joined by countrymen L√°szl√≥ Schell and G√°bor Ocskay. In his native Hungary in 2003, he was made an honorary member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, and was made an Officer of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. He was one of the inaugural group of inductees into the Hungarian Ice Hockey Hall of Fame announced during the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division I Group A tournament hosted in Budapest. He attended its inauguration at the City Park Ice Rink, on 24 February 2012. P√°sztor is also an honorary president of the Hungarian Ice Hockey Association. Personal life P√°sztor enjoyed sailing in the summer as a youth, and still spends recreation time at Lake Balaton. During his hockey career, he noted that many great Soviet Union hockey players also sailed as a secondary sport. He was a pharmacist in his professional career. He completed his education as a university student during World War II, and worked in Budapest from 1961 to 1964 after retiring as a player. Despite being educated in medicines, he prefers to use brandy at bed time to fight the common cold. P√°sztor regularly follows Hungarian hockey events, and often attends championships and tournaments. In an interview given to the Hungarian Telegraphic Office, he stated that he receives congratulations on the current success of the Hungarian national team, even though he is retired. He enjoys the annual OB I bajnoks√°g championships, the MOL Liga finals, and the Hungarian Cup of hockey. He is also a fan of Alba Vol√°n, and feels they are the strength of the Hungarian national team. P√°sztor had been married for 41 years when his wife died. His father and older brother were also pharmacists by trade. His daughter Beatrix Aruna P√°sztor is in the film industry in the United States. She was born on his 25th birthday (2 March 1958), and is a graduate of the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts, a member of the Costume Designers Guild, and is associated with The Gersh Agency.

Kandhlawi did not agree with this shura and declared himself as the head of Jamat. Kandhlawi leads the Nizamuddin Markaz faction of the Jamat. Reception Some of Kandhlawi‚Äôs statements lead the Deobandi scholars to issue fatawa against him. South African Mufti Ebrahim Desai published a fatwa on his website AskImam. The Islamic seminary of India Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa against Kandhlawi, questioning his leadership.

He was the chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5 supersonic attack aircraft, one of the most widely deployed aircraft of the PLA Air Force. He also designed the Nanchang J-12, the world's lightest supersonic fighter, which however never entered service. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  Early life and career  Lu was born on 19 August 1920 in Shanghai, Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Changzhou, Jiangsu. He studied at the Jiangsu Provincial High School from 1935 to 1937, and then entered the National Central University to study aeronautical engineering. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the university was exiled in Chongqing, China's wartime capital, and he graduated in 1941. In 1942, he received further training at the Republic of China Air Force's mechanics school in Chengdu. A year later, he was assigned to work for the No. 2 Aircraft Manufacturing Factory in Nanchuan, Chongqing, as an aircraft designer. In December 1944, he was sent to the United States to work at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, where he participated in the design of shipborne jet fighters. He was then sent to Britain to work as a designer at the Gloster Aircraft Company.  Early PRC and the Shenyang JJ-1  A Shenyang JJ-1 jet trainer In August 1949, just before the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Lu returned to China via Hong Kong to work for the new government. From 1949 to 1951, Lu worked on constructing airports in the East China Military Region. After the Korean War broke out, Lu was transferred to Beijing Nanyuan Airport to service military and transport aircraft in support of the war effort. In 1956, he was transferred to the aircraft design office of Shenyang Aircraft Factory (112 Factory), working under director Xu Shunshou. He was one of the main designers of the Shenyang JJ-1 trainer, the first jet aircraft designed in China. Besides Xu Shushou and deputy director Huang Zhiqian, Lu was the only person in the development team who had had aircraft design experience. The project began in October 1956, and the plane took its maiden flight less than two years later, on 26 July 1958. The development cycle was less than half that of similar planes designed in Japan and Czechoslovakia and the performance was superior.  Designing the Nanchang Q-5 attack aircraft  A Nanchang A-5 (Q-5) of the Bangladesh Air Force In 1958, Lu was transferred to the Hongdu Aircraft Factory (320 Factory) in Nanchang, and appointed chief designer of the Nanchang Q-5 supersonic attack aircraft. However, because of economic difficulties during the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese government decided to cancel the project in August 1961. Lu petitioned the government to save the project, and was allowed to continue his research, but his staff was reduced from more than 100 members to just 14. With his skeleton crew, Lu spent two years to build a stationary prototype aircraft. This achievement caught the attention of Minister Sun Zhiyuan (Â≠ôÂøóËøú) of the Third Ministry of Machine Building and Cao Lihuai (ÊõπÈáåÊÄÄ), Deputy Commander of the PLA Air Force. They ordered a full resumption of the project, and the Q-5 completed its maiden flight on 4 June 1965. After further testing and improvement, the Q-5 was mass produced in 1968 to equip the Air Force. It was China's first self-designed attack aircraft that was mass produced and widely deployed. In January 1972, a modified Q-5 aircraft (Q5-A) was used to conduct a hydrogen bomb test at Lop Nur. In 1981, Lu was again named chief designer for updating the Q-5 with an improved range. The redesigned Q-5, with seven different models, became one of the most widely used aircraft in the Chinese Air Force. It was also exported to foreign countries. In 1985, the Q-5 project won the Special Prize of the State Science and Technology Progress Award.  Designing the Nanchang J-12 fighter  A Nanchang J-12 on display at the Chinese Aviation Museum In the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and Arab countries, the Soviet-made aircraft performed poorly, and the PLA Air Force wanted a new lightweight fighter to replace its Shenyang J-6, which was the Chinese-made version of the Soviet MiG 19. In 1969, Lu was tasked with designing the Nanchang J-12 supersonic fighter. Only 17 months later, the aircraft took its first flight on 26 December 1970. The J-12 was the first fighter jet completely designed with Chinese technology and not modelled after a Soviet aircraft. It was also the lightest supersonic fighter in the world, with exceptional dexterity and evasion ability. However, its light weight also proved to be a weakness, as the limited space for missiles and fuel and the lack of a radar meant it had poor range and combat capabilities. As a result, the J-12 never entered service, but it laid a solid foundation for the future development of fighters.  Other contributions and awards  In addition to designing aircraft, Lu conducted theoretical research on aerodynamics. He wrote a textbook on aircraft design in 1974, and a 400,000-word research report on fourth-generation lightweight fighters.

Plot summary The story, set on a terraformed Mars, describes, using the present tense, an expedition climbing Olympus Mons, \\"the tallest mountain in the solar system\\". It is seen from the viewpoint of Roger Clayborne, who has recently resigned after twenty-seven years as Minister of the Interior at Government House in Burroughs. He feels his political career has been futile. He thinks the planet could have been left as it was found, not turned into another Earth and made a laboratory for new animals and plants. All but one of the group were born on Mars. The expedition leader is Eileen Monday. People can live for several hundred years, and she and Clayborne are both now about three hundred; she has forgotten their relationship, when they were in their twenties, but Clayborne, who has an unusually complete memory, can recall it. He talks to her of his regrets about the planet; she says his efforts with the Red Mars party would never have succeeded. The height of Olympus Mons above the base is about . There is a vertical escarpment of about , above which is the flank of the volcano crater with a gradient of about 6%. The details of mountaineering are described as the group ascends. Members take oxygen on the upper part of the ascent, and strong winds develop. During the climb, one person suffers a broken arm because of a falling rock, and is taken down by a few others; another suffers pulmonary edema because of ascending too rapidly, and is taken to a lower camp to ascend more slowly. On the flank of the volcano, where they are above the atmosphere, they wear suits and helmets. It is about from the escarpment to the rim of the crater, and they walk a day, sleeping in a pressurized tent. By the end of the journey, Clayborne and Eileen Monday's relationship has revived, and he feels persuaded by her view of the planet.
