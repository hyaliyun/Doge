In May 1798, Soleil received command of the frigate Diane. He took part in the Battle of the Nile, managing to escape to Malta. In August 1800, as the Siege of Malta approached its conclusion and Malta was about to fall to the British, he was ordered back to France. Diane was however intercepted by the British blockade and captured by HMS Success, HMS Northumberland and HMS Genereux. Back to France, Soleil was court- martialled for the loss of his frigate, as systematic in such cases, and found innocent of the capture.

The squadron was bound for Martinique, with a 1600-man Army unit, along with ammunition and other military furniture. On 25 September 1806, four ships of the line under Sir Samuel Hood met and intercepted them, leading to the Action of 25 September 1806. Four of the frigates were captured, and Soleil was taken prisoner by Captain William Lukin of . Soleil was exchanged in September 1807. He was given command of the 74-gun Pultusk, and in 1809, of the Anversois. From 1814, Soleil served in Cherbourg harbour. He retired in January 1816.

The station is currently owned by Northeastern Pennsylvania Educational TV, the owner and operator of [WVIA-FM] and other broadcasting outlets in the region |WVIA.org|. For most of its broadcasting life, WVBU-FM was owned by Bucknell University, and operated as a student-run activity. It was commonly known as the ‚ÄúVoice of Bucknell University.‚Äù Early History Experiments in radio transmission began as early as 1924 on the Bucknell University campus. Periods of experimentation, hiatuses, and collaborations with other broadcasters followed in the next four decades. In 1933, the original Bucknell Campus Radio Station was sold to a C.S. Blue in Northumberland. In 1948 Stanley C. Marshall, Alice Z. Marshall, and Paul N. Bosted successfully reclaimed the station. Early plans indicate that WVBU members believed the station could reach a potential audience of a quarter million people in Montour, Northumberland, Lycoming, Union, and Snyder counties. After considering both AM and FM broadcasting options, the station initially settled on the AM frequency. However, the AM line eventually became a closed circuit (i.e., \\"Carrier Current\\") channel, to be heard only within the Bucknell community. In response to listener concerns and requests, WVBU switched to FM broadcasting on March 1, 1963.  The first decade as a Student-Run Radio Station  The WVBU radio station became a vibrant hub of media activity beginning in the late 1960‚Äôs. Its facilities were located in the Freshman Quad Carnegie Building basement \\"Fallout Shelter\\". The compact complex contained separate FM and AM on-air studios with announcing booths, and an audio production facility with an impressive vinyl record library. A large staff of volunteers offered a variety of programs on FM and AM channels that included music, news, sports and some listener-supported programming from the Pacifica Foundation.. Station staff and officers also furnished key leadership in other campus media and entertainment enterprises. A notable example was the ‚ÄúBucknell Concert Committee‚Äù which presented a rich program of premier musical acts. The committee‚Äôs accomplishments were chronicled in a book published by Billboard magazine. Other student-initiated activities included an alternate literary periodical (The Different Drummer), a mobile video collective service (University TV) modeled on the Videofreex , and a two-semester special studies course in Media Studies.  Re-vitalization in the later 1970s  In the mid-1970s, WVBU's AM and FM studios were located in the Freshman Quad Carnegie Building basement \\"Fallout Shelter\\". The stations had fallen into disarray until a major revitalization was undertaken by Terry Ginn ('77; FM Program Director),Paul \\"The round mound of sound\\" Hill ('78; Production Manager, recently deceased), Brad Joblin ('77; AM Program Director and subsequently Station Manager) and Rick Ambrose ('77) & John Cox ('78) (Music Directors). Ambrose completely restored the album library by securing promotional status from all the major record labels. In a three-year period, more than 10,000 LPs were replaced or added. The FM station format went 24-hour progressive album rock while in February 1975, Joblin re-branded WVBU(AM) as Super64 Non-Stop Music, converting the format from progressive rock to Top 40, due to listener demand and to avoid both stations competing under the same format. Ambrose also established the Intercollegiate Broadcasting Network where major artists were interviewed and 90-minute taped specials were created. Participating college radio stations across the country received free copies in exchange for a blank reel of tape and postage. Artists interviewed by Ambrose and Joblin included Gerry Beckley of America, Elton John, Todd Rundgren, George Harrison, Alice Cooper, John Entwistle of The Who, Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, and Rick Wakeman of Yes. These artists also recorded promo IDs for WVBU which aired throughout the broadcast day for many years. In the same mid-70s time period that WVBU AM and FM were revitalized, Brad Joblin and Jim Vose ‚Äò75 took the Bucknell Concert Committee independent from outside promoters and booked Todd Rundgren, America, Santana, Billy Joel, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. The Springsteen booking coincided with him the gracing the covers of both Time and Newsweek magazines. Ambrose succeeded Joblin as Chairman and produced the Bruce Springsteen concert, as well as booking Loggins & Messina and Marshall Tucker. Another WVBU staff member, Gary Huerich ('79), booked the band Boston. These concerts were presented in Bucknell's Davis Gym to 3,000 to 4,000 people, from both Bucknell and the central Pennsylvania area. Although Aerosmith had also been scheduled in 1976, the university administration deemed them \\"too loud\\" and cancelled the date.  Later Developments under Bucknell Ownership  On March 21, 1980, the station received financial approval from the student-run ABS Congress for the purchase of necessary equipment to convert from 10 to 190 watts. The ABS Congress granted WVBU $22,000, allowing it to comply with an FCC order that all 10-watt stations either up their power to 100 watts or go off the air entirely. This endowment provided the means for the station to continue its operations, and ultimately helped get WVBU to where it currently stands today. In 2016, WVBU moved to a new location in Stuck House, which is located on the 7th Street entry street onto Bucknell's main campus.  Ownership by Northeastern Pennsylvania Educational TV Association  On April 23, 2019, it was announced that Bucknell University had agreed to sell WVBU-FM to Northeastern Pennsylvania Educational TV Association, owner of WVIA-FM in Scranton. The buyer has operated an FM translator relaying WVIA-FM to the Lewisburg area on 100.1 FM for several decades.

History The London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) opened a main line from Yeovil to Exeter on 18 July 1860, giving a through route from London. The rugged terrain of the south-east Devon coastline meant that the railway passed some distance to the north of Sidmouth; the nearest station was Feniton, nine miles away. There had been a number of railway schemes put forward over the previous decade or so to serve Sidmouth directly but they had come to nothing. Planning On 18 December 1861, London promoters held a meeting for the purpose of forming a Company to build a railway branch line to Sidmouth and a harbour there. The \\"Sidmouth Railway and Harbour Company\\" obtained an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862 with a share capital of ¬£120,000 and authorised loan capital of ¬£40,000. Subscriptions were slow to be taken up, and the contractor Shrimpton complained that he was unable to make progress, as the engineer, H H Bird, had not supplied adequate plans. Further difficulties arose when it emerged that the Company had secretly divided the share issue into two classes, and calls were only being made to one of the classes. Finally it was shown that the Company had unsupported liabilities of ¬£20,000, over three-quarters of which were due to the contractor Shrimpton. Undertakings were given to resolve the matter, but the Company foundered in 1869. The trustees of the Balfour family now launched a scheme for a Sidmouth Railway, and this got its Act of Parliament on 29 June 1871, with share capital of ¬£66,000 and borrowing powers of ¬£22,000. The line was to be constructed under the arrangements for a Light Railway, and an agreement was made with the L&SWR; for 50% of receipts if over ¬£4,000, with an option for the L&SWR; to purchase the railway. The share issue was successful and a tender for construction of the line was awarded to R T Relf of Okehampton for ¬£35,000. Possibly learning from the delays encountered in constructing the neighbouring Seaton Branch Line, there was a penalty clause for late completion of the work. Nonetheless Relf got into difficulties, asking the company for extra payment as he found that he had under-priced the station work, designs for which had not been completed at the time of tendering. The directors made a small allowance to him, and he sued for the balance, but he lost his case. However the railway was complete by July 1874. Col F H Rich of the Railway Inspectorate of the Board of Trade duly made the inspection and passed the line for opening. It opened on Monday 6 July 1874. Early operation On the opening day there was no formal ceremony to mark the event, although celebrations took place through the first week. The branch was single track. The junction station on the main line at Feniton had been called Ottery RoadThe station had had several different names since opening. immediately prior to the opening, but the name was changed to Sidmouth Junction on the day of opening of the branch line. Sidmouth trains used a bay platform on the down (south) side of the station, and they left the bay in an eastwards direction. On leaving the station, the line curved round to the south falling at 1 in 110 and then 1 in 53, followed by flattish gradients to Ottery St Mary, 2 miles 78 chains from Sidmouth Junction; there was a crossing loop. Just before the next station the line crossed the river Otter on a 55-yard viaduct, then entering Tipton, at 5 miles 8 chains, also equipped with a crossing loop. The name was changed to Tipton St John on 1 February 1881. Leaving Tipton the line now climbed at 1 in 45 for two miles to Bowd Summit, then falling at 1 in 54 for a mile to Sidmouth station, at 8 miles 23 chains. The station was some considerable distance from the sea front. When the line opened, the passenger train service comprised seven trains each way six days a week, taking 28 to 30 minutes for the journey. After the opening of the Budleigh Salterton Railway the train frequency on the northern half of the original Sidmouth railway naturally increased. By 1909 the service had approximately doubled, with trains on Sundays also. Sidmouth was not an industrial town, so goods services mainly brought inwards agricultural supplies, building materials and coal for domestic purposes and for the gasworks at Sidmouth. The branch was worked by staff and ticket at first, with Tyers electric train tablet system being introduced in 1904. The very steep gradients meant that special precautions had to be imposed for the operation of goods trains over the line. Locomotive power initially was restricted to those suitable for use on light railways, and this is thought to include Beattie 2-4-0 well tanks. In later years the M7 0-4-4T class came to dominate. When the West Country light pacific 21C110 was to receive its name Sidmouth at a naming ceremony, it visited Sidmouth for the purpose on 27 June 1946, but the class was normally banned until after 1951. Tipton was renamed Tipton St John's on 1 February 1881. Attempted takeover In 1894 the L&SWR;, which was operating the line, offered to purchase it outright for ¬£70,050 but this was refused by the Company. However, in 1922, just before the Grouping of the railways in Great Britain, a share swap was arranged, effectively ending the independent existence of the Sidmouth Railway company. Later operation Exmouth & Sidmouth 1908From the opening of the Exmouth and Salterton section, the L&SWR; was now operating the small network served from Sidmouth Junction: to Sidmouth and to Exmouth, forking at Tipton. The L&SWR; later purchased the Budleigh Salterton line, and this became effective on 1 January 1911. The section from Sidmouth Junction to Sidmouth has been described above; from Tipton St John's towards Exmouth the line fell at 1 in 50‚Äîthe contrary gradients viewed from Tipton platform looking south were startling‚Äîthen easing to 1 in 360 and then level beyond Newton Poppleford, falling again at 1 in 100 for a while. Moderate gradients followed as far as East Budleigh (originally plain Budleigh) after which the line climbed at 1 in 50 for 1¬Ω miles, then after Knowle cutting falling again at 1 in 50 until the Salterton Road overbridge approaching Exmouth. The lines became very busy in the first decades of the twentieth century, with ten trains each way on the Budleigh Salterton line. Matters were especially busy at Tipton St John's where Waterloo trains divided and joined (for Sidmouth and Exmouth respectively), with as many as 50 train movements per day. From 1914 a number of Waterloo to Exmouth express trains were routed via Tipton. From 1927 a service from Nottingham via the Somerset and Dorset line and Templecombe. In the summer of 1938 there were eleven trains each way daily between Sidmouth and Sidmouth Junction and five each way between Sidmouth and Tipton St Johns; and five trains between Tipton St Johns and Exmouth, three of which originated from or ran to Sidmouth, and the other two to or from Sidmouth Junction. Three trains each way ran through to or from Exeter. There were three trains with through coaches from or to Waterloo (four more on Saturdays, with a Derby train as well). Through coaches were discontinued in 1964 except on summer Saturdays, as the local trains were diesel multiple units. The lines closed to passenger traffic on 6 March 1967 and to freight on 8 May that year. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

The accident killed 71 passengers and crew and five people were injured but survived. Accident Cameroon Airlines Flight 3701 took off from Cadjehoun Airport in Cotonou, Benin, on a flight to Douala International Airport. The Boeing 737-200 had 71 passengers and five crew on board and after a one-hour flight was ready to land at Douala International Airport, but as the landing gear was lowered the nose gear light showed that it was not down. The pilots called air traffic control saying that they had landing gear problems and the crew elected to abort the approach. Some minutes later they tried a second approach but the pilots did not see that the engine two was operating at high power while the No. 1 engine was not developing power. Then the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed short of the runway in a mangrove swamp. The aircraft burst into flames, killing 71 passengers and crew. Five people survived the accident.

As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII & Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known. During the 1970s and 1980s, some people were infected with Hepatitis C via blood transfusions under entirely different circumstances. However, the Factor Concentrate products used by people with haemophilia were processed pharmaceutical products which bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections to those with haemophilia were principally caused by the plasma derived product known as Factor VIII, a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes. Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material. In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for whole blood in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to those infected (as described in the documentary Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal). It is said that the principal reason that the UK imported these products was that it did not produce enough of its own. A study published in 1986 showed that 76% of those who used commercial Factor products became infected with HIV, as opposed to none of those who only used the previous treatment cryoprecipitate. No government, healthcare or pharmaceutical entity in the UK has admitted any liability in the scandal, and no damages or compensation have been paid to those infected or affected, although the government has provided some means-tested benefits to some of the surviving victims through a Trust.  Background  Haemophilia is a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to clot, a process needed to stop bleeding. This results in people bleeding longer after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or other parts of the body. Some people can now be cured from Haemophilia altogether, but modern \\"synthetic\\" or \\"non-human derived\\" Factor products such as Recombinant Factor VIII continue to be widely used. Factor products work by replacing the missing Factor proteins, which can take place at home or in hospital. The clotting factors are made either from Plasma or by recombinant methods. In the 1970s, haemophiliacs began to be treated with \\"Factor Concentrates\\", which were sold as a revolutionary treatment. The consequential increase in use led to pharmaceutical companies seeking substantial supplies of plasma, and thousands of donors including prisoners, drug addicts, prostitutes and people known to be infected with HIV or hepatitis were allowed or even paid to give their plasma. Some of the most famous examples of risky plasma harvesting are those of Luckner Cambronne who became known as \\"The Vampire of the Caribbean\\" and also Crysosan Ltd, a company based in Canada that was found guilty of harvesting plasma from the bodies of dead Russians and re-labelling it as originating from Swedish donors.  Products  Plasma donations could be collected using a process called plasmapheresis. In addition to NHS derived Factor produced by Bio Products Laboratory (BPL), manufacturers that supplied clotting factor products to the UK during the mid-1970s and 1980s included Abbott (Profilate), Armour Pharmaceuticals (Factorate), Bayer-owned Cutter (Koate), Baxter International-owned Travenol/Hyland (Hemofil/Interhem), Immuno (Kryobulin) and Speywood (Humanate). *BPL: In 2013 the British government sold an 80% stake in the company to Bain Capital for approximately ¬£230 million. In 2016 BPL was acquired by the Creat Group for ¬£820m; the government stood to receive ¬£164m from its remaining 20% share in BPL. *Armour (Revlon): In 1978 Armour was purchased by Revlon for $90m which owned the company until 1987 when it was sold to Rh√¥ne-Poulenc which purchased Revlon's drug operation for $690m in cash. In 1996 Armour and Behringwerke were merged and became Centeon. In 1999 Centeon changed its name to Aventis Behring after the parent companies, Rorer and Hoechst AG merged to become Aventis. In 2004, CSL completed its acquisition of Aventis Behring for $925m, today known as CSL Behring. *Bayer: Cutter Labs, which produced Factor VIII, was originally owned by Miles Laboratories. In 1974 Cutter Labs was purchased by Bayer, and in 1978 Bayer also purchased Miles Labs. In 1995 Bayer dropped the Miles Labs brand name. In 2005 a new company, Talecris (set up by Cerberus Capital Management and Ampersand) acquired Bayer's plasma business and assets for $590m. Bayer however, did not include its recombinant Factor VIII \\"Kogenate\\" in the sale and remains active in distribution internationally. In 2009, CSL Limited attempted to takeover Talecris for $3.1 billion but was stopped by the Federal Trade Commission which charged the deal would be illegal. In 2011, a year after announcing the $4bn deal, Grifols completed a takeover of Talecris. *Hyland/Travenol (Baxter): Baxter created Travenol Labs in 1949 and acquired Hyland Labs in 1952. In 1993 Baxter was implicated in a lawsuit brought by haemophiliacs infected with HIV in the United States, and by the end of that year president James Tobin quit. In 1996 Baxter settled a lawsuit brought by haemophiliacs in Japan. In 2015, Baxter split-off its haemophilia sector to create Baxalta. In 2016 Baxalta was acquired by Shire plc for $32bn. *Immuno AG: Baxter purchased Immuno AG in 1996 in an effort to keep up with competitors for some $715m.  1973 - 1986 - Hepatitis  The dangers of factor concentrates had been raised since their inception. In 1974, American scientist Judith Graham Pool (who previously discovered the frozen blood product cryoprecipitate, a safer treatment) described the products as \\"dangerous\\" and \\"unethical\\" and warned against their use. The World Health Organization also warned the UK not to import blood from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis, such as the United States. In May 1975, the World Health Organization passed a widely circulated resolution urging all countries to aim at self-sufficiency in blood-products. In September 1975, an article was published detailing occurrences of a new kind of Hepatitis. In December 1975 an episode of the World in Action programme highlighted the danger of Hepatitis from imported Factor products. By the end of 1978 more than 50% of the Factor VIII used in England was being imported from overseas. This was because the country had failed to become self-sufficient in its own supplies. The BPL, which manufactured UK blood products, ran into continual trouble from under-funding. The Archer Report said, \\"In July 1979, the Medicines Inspectorate visited BPL. They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: 'If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level'. BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity. Among their recommendations the Inspectorate advised: 'Under no circumstances should production of any product be increased under the existing manufacturing conditions'. Meanwhile, the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40% of the national requirements.\\" A study published in December 1983 showed conclusively that the risk to a haemophiliac of contracting Hepatitis C by using untreated Factor products was 100% upon first exposure.  1981 - 1986 - HIV  In July 1982, the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that at least 3 haemophiliacs there had developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 2 had died, and all 3 had used untreated Factor products. The CDC said that \\"the occurrence among the three hemophiliac cases suggests the possible transmission of an agent through blood products\\". In March 1983, the CDC reported that \\"Blood products or blood appear responsible for AIDS among hemophilia patients\\". In May 1983 Dr N. S. Galbraith, director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in England and Wales, sent a paper entitled \\"Action on AIDS\\" to Dr Ian Field at the Department of Health and Social Security in London informing him of the death from AIDS of a haemophiliac who had received Factor VIII concentrate imported from the United States. Galbraith stated: \\"I have reviewed the literature and come to the conclusion that all blood products made from blood donated in the USA after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of AIDS transmission by these products has been clarified ... I am most surprised that the USA manufacturers of the implicated blood products have not informed their customers of this new hazard. I assume no critical warning has been received in the United Kingdom?\\" Despite Galbraith's warning the products were not withdrawn: a Department of Health letter considered that his suggestion was \\"premature\\". In September 1983 a leaflet distributed to UK blood donors answered the question as to whether AIDS could be transmitted by blood- products to be \\"Almost certainly yes\\". In November 1983 the UK Health Minister, Ken Clarke told parliament that \\"There is no conclusive evidence that AIDS is transmitted by blood products\\" and the importation of infected products continued. When giving evidence to the Penrose Inquiry, Dr Mark Winter said that at the time Ken Clarke made this statement \\"all haemophilia clinicians by this stage clearly believed that commercial blood products could and were transmitting AIDS\\". In January 1984, Lord Glenarthur (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the DHSS) said that \\"It remains the case that there is no conclusive evidence of the transmission of AIDS through blood products, although the circumstantial evidence is strong\\", and again the use of untreated Factor products and importation continued.  2000 - Destroyed Evidence Investigation  In April 2000 the Department of Health published an internal audit to examine the loss of records relating to Hepatitis C litigation. The report concluded that \\"an arbitrary and unjustified decision, most likely taken by an inexperienced member of staff, was responsible for the destruction of a series of files containing the minutes and background papers of the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood (ACSVB)\\".  2009 ‚Äì The Archer Report  In the early 2000s the former Solicitor General for England and Wales, Lord Archer, campaigned for an inquiry into the tainted blood scandal alongside Lord Owen, who was the Health Minister from 1974 to 1976, Lord Jenkin, former Shadow Health Secretary, and others. They were unsuccessful. In a 1990 episode of The Cook Report, Owen said: \\"I can see why some people would be unhappy with having all the facts revealed because it will show negligence\\". In September 2016 Owen gave a speech in London during which he said the scandal had been covered-up. Archer chaired a privately funded independent investigation set up in 2007. The Archer Report was published in 2009 and aimed to uncover the causes of the events that led to the thousands of infections and deaths. The report held no legal or official status and was unable to subpoena witnesses or demand the disclosure of documents. Nonetheless, it sought to address the issue of missing evidence and documents relating to the scandal. For example, the ministerial papers of Lord Owen had been destroyed. \\"We have been unable to ascertain who carried out the destruction of the papers, and who gave the instructions. But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources\\", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: \\"He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents. One of these was to be treated as confidential\\". Lord Jenkin felt that the destruction of records was deliberate, and done \\"in order to draw a line under the disaster\\". Another handling error is described in the inquiry: \\"mishandling of documents arose in connection with a number of files relating to the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood between May 1989 and February 1992 which were found to be missing\\". The report went on to state: \\"They were in fact destroyed over a period from July 1994 to March 1998\\". When summarising these events it is stated \\"some of those who gave evidence to us suspected that there was an exercise in suppressing evidence of negligence or misconduct.\\"  2015 ‚Äì Scottish Penrose Inquiry  In 2008 the Scottish government announced a public inquiry into the scandal covering Scotland only, to be chaired by Lord Penrose. The inquiry's terms of reference outlined five deaths that were to be examined, but only one of those victims was a haemophiliac and that person had been infected with hepatitis C in the 1960s, before the factor concentrates were introduced. Published in 2015, the inquiry was described as a whitewash and waste of public money (over ¬£12 million) by critics after it made just one recommendation and failed to apportion any blame in the scandal. Its recommendation was to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who had not already been tested for hepatitis C.  2017 ‚Äì Legal action and UK public inquiry  In July 2017 a group legal action Jason Evans & Ors was brought against the government on behalf of more than 500 people by Collins Solicitors. After years of increasing pressure from campaigners and MPs, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a full UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal. In September 2017 a court ruling found in favour of the victims allowing them to launch a High Court action to seek damages.  2018 ‚Äì False ministerial statements withdrawn  In June 2018 the Department of Health issued an apology, because for two years Ministers had told Parliament that in relation to Contaminated Blood Scandal evidence: \\"All documents up to 1995 are available through the National Archive\\".  2019 ‚Äì Files still missing  In February 2019, it emerged that around 450 files had been taken from the archives by staff from the Department of Health and Social Security, and not returned, sparking concerns among campaigners that the department was attempting a cover-up.  Government support  Successive governments, both Labour and Conservative, have been criticised for their handling of the case, limited support schemes and refusal to conduct a public inquiry (until 2017). Some limited support has been provided to selected individuals through charitable trusts which is often subject to means testing, though no damages or compensation have ever been paid to UK victims or their families. In 1991 the Conservative government made ¬£42 million available to those affected by HIV, this equates to around ¬£29,000 on average between the 1,437 people who received a payment. In 2017 the Conservatives announced more funds for those with first-stage chronic hepatitis C, but this additional money was reportedly to be sourced from funds for other tainted blood victims. The Department of Health was accused of robbing one set of victims to pay another. Officials stated that it had made available an extra ¬£125 million, more than any previous government, but critics said this money was simply accounted for as a cost to the NHS of extending treatments to hepatitis C sufferers sooner.

From 2,100 submissions, \\"Quest\\" (with 120 suggestions) was selected by the company. 2013 Refit From May 13, 2013 to June 2, 2013, Seabourn Quest was drydocked for a refit at the T. Mariotti shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Work on the ship included 2 new additional cranes in outdoor spaces aft deck 6, 4 additional Zodiac cradles, rearrangement of incinerator room and increasing of retention capacity, installation of a new water ballast treatment system in engine room and minor mechanical and piping works in engine room and drydock. Additional work included the ship‚Äôs marina being refitted to accommodate the Zodiac inflatables that will be used in Seabourn‚Äôs upcoming Antarctica cruises along with general upgrades and additions to the crew area that have already been introduced on the Seabourn Odyssey and Seabourn Sojourn. This refit had no implications for the vessel's ice class. The refit involved only minor modifications to accommodate the Zodiacs.

In the stamp folding problem, the paper is a strip of stamps with creases between them, and the folds must lie on the creases. In the map folding problem, the paper is a map, divided by creases into rectangles, and the folds must again lie only along these creases. credits the invention of the stamp folding problem to √âmile Lemoine.. provides several other early references.. Labeled stamps In the stamp folding problem, the paper to be folded is a strip of square or rectangular stamps, separated by creases, and the stamps can only be folded along those creases. In one commonly considered version of the problem, each stamp is considered to be distinguishable from each other stamp, so two foldings of a strip of stamps are considered equivalent only when they have the same vertical sequence of stamps. For example, there are six ways to fold a strip of three different stamps: Image:Stampfoldings1x3.png These include all six permutations of the stamps, but for more than three stamps not all permutations are possible. If, for a permutation , there are two numbers and with the same parity such that the four numbers , , , and appear in in that cyclic order, then cannot be folded. The parity condition implies that the creases between stamps and , and between stamps and , appear on the same side of the stack of folded stamps, but the cyclic ordering condition implies that these two creases cross each other, a physical impossibility. For instance, the four-element permutation 1324 cannot be folded, because it has this forbidden pattern with and . All remaining permutations, without this pattern, can be folded. The number of different ways to fold a strip of stamps is given by the sequence :1, 2, 6, 16, 50, 144, 462, 1392, 4536, 14060, 46310, 146376, 485914, 1557892, 5202690, ... . These numbers are always divisible by (because a cyclic permutation of a foldable stamp sequence is always itself foldable),. As cited by and the quotients of this division are :1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 24, 66, 174, 504, 1406, 4210, 12198, 37378, 111278, 346846, 1053874, ... , the number of topologically distinct ways that a half-infinite curve can make crossings with a line, called \\"semimeanders\\". In the 1960s, John E. Koehler and W. F. Lunnon implemented algorithms that, at that time, could calculate these numbers for up to 28 stamps. Despite additional research, the known methods for calculating these numbers take exponential time as a function of . Thus, there is no formula or efficient algorithm known that could extend this sequence to very large values of . Nevertheless, heuristic methods from physics can be used to predict the rate of exponential growth of this sequence. The stamp folding problem usually considers only the number of possible folded states of the strip of stamps, without considering whether it is possible to physically construct the fold by a sequence of moves starting from an unfolded strip of stamps. However, according to the solution of the carpenter's rule problem, every folded state can be constructed (or equivalently, can be unfolded). Unlabeled stamps In another variation of the stamp folding problem, the strip of stamps is considered to be blank, so that it is not possible to tell one of its ends from the other, and two foldings are considered distinct only when they have different shapes. Turning a folded strip upside-down or back-to-front is not considered to change its shape, so three stamps have only two foldings, an S-curve and a spiral. More generally, the numbers of foldings with this definition are :1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 38, 120, 353, 1148, 3527, 11622, 36627, 121622, 389560, 1301140, 4215748, ... Maps Map folding is the question of how many ways there are to fold a rectangular map along its creases, allowing each crease to form either a mountain or a valley fold. It differs from stamp folding in that it includes both vertical and horizontal creases, rather than only creases in a single direction. There are eight ways to fold a 2 √ó 2 map along its creases, counting each different vertical sequence of folded squares as a distinct way of folding the map:. See in particular pp. 60‚Äì62. 350 px However, the general problem of counting the number of ways to fold a map remains unsolved. The numbers of ways of folding an map are known only for . They are: :1, 8, 1368, 300608, 186086600, 123912532224, 129950723279272 . Complexity The map folding and stamp folding problems are related to a problem in the mathematics of origami of whether a square with a crease pattern can be folded to a flat figure. If a folding direction (either a mountain fold or a valley fold) is assigned to each crease of a strip of stamps, it is possible to test whether the result can be folded flat in polynomial time. For the same problem on a map (divided into rectangles by creases with assigned directions) it is unknown whether a polynomial time folding algorithm exists in general, although a polynomial algorithm is known for maps. In a restricted case where the map is to be folded by a sequence of \\"simple\\" folds, which fold the paper along a single line, the problem is polynomial. Some extensions of the problem, for instance to non-rectangular sheets of paper, are NP-complete.. Even for a one-dimensional strip of stamps, with its creases already labeled as mountain or valley folds, it is NP-hard to find a way to fold it that minimizes the maximum number of stamps that lie between the two stamps of any crease.

New Jesus San Francesco di Paola Girolamini Little St. Peter Christianity and religion in general has always been an important part of the social and cultural life of Naples. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Naples, and the Catholic faith is highly important to the people of Naples and there are hundreds of historic churches in the city (about five hundred, 1000 in total).Giornaledellarte.com The Cathedral of Naples is the most important place of worship in the city, each year on September 19 it hosts the Miracle of Saint Januarius, the city's patron saint. In the miracle which thousands of Neapolitans flock to witness, the dried blood of Januarius is said to turn to liquid when brought close to relics said to be of his body: this is one of the most important traditions for Neapolitans. Churches and their styles The cathedral of San Gennaro (Saint Januarius), was built under the patronage of Charles of Anjou in 1272, on the site of the ancient Stefania cathedral of the 8th century, and completed in 1341, the work of Nicol√≤ Pisano, Maglione, and Masuccio. The church is in Gothic style with three naves; the fa√ßade, modified by the restoration of 1788, has been brought again to its original style; its principal door is a work of Babuccio Piferno (1407), while its chapel of San Restituta is said to date from the time of Constantine. The fourteen pilasters are adorned with busts of famous archbishops of Naples. In the crypt, which was built by Malvito by order of Archbishop Carafa, is venerated the body of St. Januarius, taken there from Montevergine in 1479. Of the lateral chapels, that of the Treasure is the most notable; it is there that the head of St. Januarius and the ampull√¶ that contain the martyr's blood are preserved. The cathedral contains the superb sepulchres of Innocent IV and of a Cardinal Minutoli. the second, a work of Girolamo d'Auria; also, valuable 13th-century frescos of Santafede, Vincenzo Forti, Luca Giordano, and others, and paintings by Giovanni di Nola, Franco, Perugino, and Domenichino. Among other churches are the church of Sant Agostino alla Zecca, which has a pulpit of the 15th century, sculptures by Vincent d'Angelo and Giovanni da Nola, and a painting by Diana (the Communion of St. Augustine). The church of the Santi Apostoli was completed in 1608; it houses works by Giordano, Marco da Siena, Bonomini, and Dolci, the tabernacle of the high altar being the work of Caugiano. The church of San Domenico Maggiore, dating from 1255, is rich in paintings, mosaics, and sepulchres, and in the ancient monastery connected with this church is the cell of San Thomas Aquinas. The church of Donna Regina, built by Mary of Hungary, in 1300, and rebuilt by the Theatine Guarino in 1670, contains valuable paintings and frescos, and also, the tomb of the foundress. The church of San Filippo Neri, in baroque style, by Dionisio di Bartolomeo (1592), contains statues by Sammartino, and both the church and the sacristy have very valuable paintings by Luca Giordano, Camillo Guerra, Guido Reni, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Spagnoletto and others. The church of San Francesco di Paola (1817) is a Neoclassic imitation of the Pantheon, with two wings that have porticos, is adorned with paintings of the 19th century. The Basilica of San Giacomo degli Spagnoli (1540) is decorated in a Renaissance style. The church of San Giovanni a Carbonara (1343) contains the mausoleums of King Ladislaus of Naples, and of the constable Sergianni Caracciolo, and paintings by famous artists. The church of Santa Barbara, a work of Giuliano da Maiano, has a beautiful bas-relief of the Madonna with angels over the principal entrance, and another fine bas-relief within the edifice; adjacent to the church is the cell inhabited by Saint Francis of Paola. The church of Santa Chiara (1310), restored in 1752, contains the mausoleums of Robert the Wise and of other personages, and also, paintings by Lanfranco, Giotto, and other artists. The church of Santa Maria del Carmine, built in the 13th century, and restored in 1769, contains the tomb of Conradin, and a statue (1847) of the tragic young medieval king designed by the Neoclassic sculptor Thorvaldsen and commissioned by then crown-prince, Maximilian II of Bavaria.

It provides information to provide foreign (international), federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with suspects for firearm crime investigations, detect suspected firearms traffickers, and track the intrastate, interstate and international movement of firearms. Congressional restrictions are in place to prevent the release of firearms trace information to anyone other than law enforcement agencies, however, this restriction does not apply to participating foreign countries or agencies. The only restriction is by Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the agency receiving ATF's eTrace software. The NTC is located on a secure site in Martinsburg, West Virginia. This facility also houses ATF's Violent Crime Analysis Branch, Firearms Technology Branch, Firearms Testing Range, Brady Operations Branch, ATF's Gun Vault Collection, the Federal Explosives Licensing Center, Imports Branch, NFA Branch, and the Federal Firearms Licensing Center.  Firearms tracing  Firearms tracing is the systematic tracking of the movement of a firearms recovered by law enforcement officials from the first sale by the manufacturer or importer through the distribution chain (wholesaler/retailer) to the first retail purchaser. Comprehensive firearms tracing is the routine tracing of every gun recovered within a geographic area or specific law enforcement jurisdiction. The ATF computer system used for firearms tracing is eTrace.  eTrace  eTrace is an ATF computer system which provides on-line trace submission through the internet, and provides the utilities for submitting, retrieving, storing, and querying all firearms trace related information relative to the requestor's agency. Distribution of eTrace to law enforcement began in January 2005. As of February, 2015, more than 5,600 U.S. law enforcement agencies and 41 foreign countries use eTrace. More than 360,000 trace requests were processed in fiscal year 2014. In December 2009, ATF released a bilingual version (eTrace 4.0) of eTrace allowing firearm traces in Spanish or English which has been deployed in Guatemala, Costa Rica and throughout Mexico. Recently, according to a 2016 GAO report, in 2013, Mexico restricted eTrace access solely to the Mexican Attorney General Office. Foreign countries currently using eTrace include: Albania, Finland, Spain, Suriname, and the United Kingdom.  History   History of Out-of-Business Record Systems  Before 1991, ATF kept the Out-of-Business records in paper hard copy filed at the Out-of-Business Records Center. In 1991, they began a major project to microfilm the paper records and destroy the hard copy. This project not only included the licensee's \\"Bound Book\\" (Acquisition/Disposition records), but also every ATF Form 4473, which contains name, address, height, weight, race, date of birth, place of birth, and driver's license number (or other ID). (GAO Report T-GGD-96-104, 04/25/96)  Computer Assisted Retrieval System (CARS) In 1992, ATF began creating a computerized \\"index\\" (based on firearm serial number and dealer license number) to the microfilmed Out-of- Business records. Data was originally captured on minicomputers and transferred to a mainframe computer database. The retrieval system, called \\"CARS\\" (Computer Assisted Retrieval System), was disclosed in a 1995 letter to Tanya K. Metaksa of the NRA. By 2000, ATF revealed they had indexed 100 million such records, with over 300 million additional records scheduled to be added over the following two years. (Commerce in Firearms, ATF, 2000) Over 400 million firearm transaction records were to be indexed by 2002 ‚Äì about twice the total estimated number of firearms in the United States at that time. According to gun rights advocates, which have long opposed any centralized, searchable registry of firearms sales, and notwithstanding the conclusions of the Government Accounting Office in 1996 that this system complied with legislative restrictions, this combination of automated and manual retrieval of individual sales records is a de facto system of registration of firearms, firearm owners and firearm transaction specifically prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 926(a).  Microfilm Retrieval System (MRS) By March, 2004, ATF acknowledged the existence of their advanced automated Microfilm Retrieval System (MRS) containing information on 380 million firearms with an additional 1 million firearms added per month. This system had been enlarged from the previous system (CARS) to contain not only firearm serial numbers, but the manufacturer and importer as well. Additional data fields have been added to help identify specific firearms. (April Pattavina, 2005) More recently (since at least 2005), ATF has been converting microfilmed dealer out-of-business records to \\"digital images\\". It is not clear whether this is a digitized \\"picture\\" file of the microfilm, or a digital record of each individual acquisition/disposition. However, guns rights advocates take the position that, regardless of the storage method, and whether access to the detail A/D record is automated or manual, this system is a system of registration of firearms, firearm owners and firearm transactions prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 926(a). In a paper presented to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, Switzerland, published in 2003, Gary L. Thomas, Chief, Firearms Programs Division, ATF, discussed the planned digitization of Out-of- Business dealer, importer, and manufacturer records, mentioned the projected cost, and noted it would not require any legislative or regulatory changes. Shortly thereafter, the digitization project appeared in the Congressional Appropriations Bill. From the 2005 Appropriations Bill: > Conversion of Records. The conferees recognize the need for ATF to complete > the conversion of tens of thousands of existing Federal firearms dealer out- > of-business records from film to digital images at the ATF National Tracing > Center. Once the out-of-business records are fully converted, search time > for these records will be reduced significantly. The conference agreement > includes $4,200,000 for the ATF to hire additional contract personnel to > continue the conversion and integration of records. However, according to guns rights advocates, Appropriations Bills since 1979 have prohibited centralizing these same records: > Provided, That no funds appropriated herein shall be available for salaries > or administrative expenses in connection with consolidating or centralizing, > within the Department of Justice, the records, or any portion thereof, of > acquisition and disposition of firearms maintained by Federal firearms > licensees: In the 2008 Appropriations Bill, the Tiahrt Amendment further restricted the disclosure of data from the Firearms Tracing System. Firearms trace database According to a Congressional Research Service report issued in 2009, \\"ATF has defined 'crime gun' to mean any firearm that is illegally possessed, used in crime, or suspected to have been used in crime. An abandoned firearm may also be categorized as a crime gun if it is suspected it was used in a crime or illegally possessed. Under this definition, most, but not all, traced firearms are 'crime guns.'\\" The CRS report notes certain methodological limits on firearms trace data: (1) traced firearms are generally those recovered by law enforcement, and so \\"may not be representative of firearms possessed and used by criminals\\" more generally; (2) \\"there remains significant variation over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to 'when, why, and how' a firearm is recovered and selected to be traced\\"; and (3) \\"a substantial percentage of recovered firearms cannot be successfully traced for several reasons including poor recordkeeping by FFLs.\\" The ATF describes the firearms trace database as \\"an operational system designed to aid in ongoing investigations, rather than a system to capture 'crime gun' statistics.\\" Despite these limitations, the CRS report notes \\"combined with multiple handgun sales reports and other investigative data, firearm trace data have proven to be a viable tool for ATF in targeting regulatory and investigative resources with greater effect.\\" References External links *Wayback Machine Category:United States federal firearms law Category:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ","title":"National Tracing Center"},{"id":"26185810","text":"The Mistress () is a 1962 Swedish drama film directed by Vilgot Sj√∂man.

Mercury, Hamble) at the age of 14.Larn's biography on the website of Shipwrecks UK Ltd, retrieved February 10, 2010. Larn taught himself to dive in 1947, using a German-made Dr√§ger U-boat escape set in the River Thames. He then joined the Merchant Navy where he served his apprenticeship as a deck-officer with the South American Saint LineLarn's biography on the website of the International Shipwreck Conference, retrieved February 10, 2010. and eventually became 2nd Mate. In 1950 he transferred to the Royal Navy where he stayed for 22 years. As a Chief Petty Officer Mechanician/diver he served in Korea and initiated diving from Dragonfly helicopters to recover ram-jet un-manned gunnery target drone aircraft off Malta, being dropped into the sea wearing diving equipment with Petty Officer John Guppy, up to five miles offshore, to assist a rescue tug in recovering the targets intact. They were possibly the first divers in the Royal Navy to operate using diving apparatus from helicopters, long before SAR divers. He also participated in diving expeditions all over the world. Larn then specialised in air-launched weapons, Firestreak, Redtop, Sidewinder, Bullpup, Mk.43 and 44 homing torpedoes, and the 2000lb HEMC nuclear bomb, and was Chief Petty Officer i/c the Guided Weapons Section on board HMS Hermes for three years, which required Positive Security Vetting to Top Secret - Atomic. In 1957 he became a BSAC member, and served as BSAC Deputy Diving Officer in 1961 and 1962. Larn was also among the instigating members of the Naval Air Command Sub Aqua Club (NATSAC), the Royal Navy Sub-Aqua Club, which was established in the early 1960s with Lieutenant Roy Graham as its first chairman, and Larn as its Diving Officer.interview with Roy Graham in December 2005. One of the club's first major projects, initiated by Larn's extensive research into the Scilly naval disaster of 1707, was to send a team of Royal Navy divers, based on board the minesweeper HM/XSV Puttenham, to the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall to find an historic fleet of sunken Royal Navy ships, led by HMS Association, a 90-gun Second Rate Ship of the Line lost in the 1707 disaster.Wreck of the fleet and treasures of the deep, The Islander 3, Autumn/Winter 2007.The HMS Association Treasure Wreck, Scilly Isles In 1964 about ten NACSAC members, including Larn,Statement by PS Hygate, Chief Executive for the Tricentenary of the Wreck of the Association. arrived on Scilly ‚Äì thought at that time to be only the second group of divers ever to come there. Their initial dives sparked off a long chain of navy visits that continued for four years. The annual expedition in 1966 was announced as a search for the wreck of the Association. Plans to find it had existed before, but until then the dives in the Isles of Scilly had largely discovered modern wrecks. The divers could only get out to the Western Rocks, but hardly around the Gilstone Ledge, where a later expedition managed to locate the wreck of the Association in 1967; Larn was not present in 1967 having been given a \\"pier-head jump\\" at the last minute to HMS Bulwark in Singapore. However, on his return he led NACSAC for its 1969, 1970 and 1971 expeditions to the islands, before leaving the Royal Navy.BSAC Pioneers on the British Sub-Aqua Club website. After the Navy In 1972 Larn left the Royal Navy as a Chief Petty Officer/ Weapons Electrical Mechanician to pursue a career in private business. After two years as Works Director for Partech Electronics International Ltd, Charlestown, helping the Company to move to Cornwall from Wellyn Garden City, he then founded a commercial diving training centre Prodive Ltd. initially in the Long Store, Charlestoiwn, then in Falmouth Docks, Cornwall, which aimed at improving the training standard of professional commercial deep sea divers in the oil and gas offshore industry. Prodive Ltd became one of only three diver training establishments in the UK approved to operate training to HSE Standards, and train Government sponsored students. In 1976 he established the Charlestown Shipwreck and Heritage Centre which grew out of his own collection of shipwreck artifacts which he ran until 1998 with his second wife, Bridget,. Living in Charlestown for 31 years, he was joint owner and curator of one of the largest collections of shipwreck artifacts on public display in Europe. Larn and his wife Bridget then moved to the Isles of Scilly in 1986, where they lived from 1986 to 1991 during which they set up and ran the Longstone Heritage Centre. on the island of St. Mary's, retaining their interest in Charlestown. Lloyd's Register then offered Larn a ten-year writing contract to produce a multi-volume series recording known shipwrecks around Gt. Britain & Ireland, which necessitated he and his wife selling their business in the Scillies and move back to the mainland. In 1982 he sold his shares in Prodive Ltd to his partner, Roger Parker, and spent the next four years treasure hunting, leading successful expeditions to recover thousands of silver Lion Daalder coins from the Dutch East India Company ship Campen, sunk off the Needles, isle of Wight, and then copper ingots, artifacts and literally millions of copper coins from the English East Indiaman Admiral Gardner, on the Goodwin Sands, Kent. Other shipwreck projects concerned historic wrecks including the Coronation, Ramillies, Dartmouth, Schiedam, Dollar Cove, Santo Christo de Castello, and the St.Anthony. Larn is currently the Licensee for the Bartholomew Ledge wreck site, and the Tearing Ledge site (HMS Eagle) on the Isles of Scilly. Together with his wife he has written over 65 books and countless articles on maritime history and archaeology, shipwrecks and the sea. Their 'Shipwreck Index of the British Isles'(Vol's 1-6) a monumental work with details of 45,000 ships, for Lloyd's Register of Shipping, was used by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments (now English Heritage)to establish the NMR(National Maritime Record), followed by a similar record for both the Scottish and Welsh Governments. In retirement, Larn is still active in diving, mostly in the Isles of Scilly where he contributes a regular column on maritime history in the local magazines Scilly Now & Then and the Scillonian Magazine. His other interests include figurehead and ship carving, and model making.

Patrick Ascione, janvier 2014, Auditorium St-Germain, Paris. Photo : Didier Allard ¬©Ina Patrick Ascione, 2014. Photo Gaspard Ascione  Biography  Patrick Ascione (Paris, France, 1953) began composing in 1976 and shortly after joined the team of the Institut International de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB, France) which he left in 1984. At the same time he started composition by computer at IRCAM (Research institute and coordination acoustics / music). He has pursued his activities independently and has produced a series of pieces, the majority of which have been commissions from the Groupe de recherches musicales of the Institut national de l'audiovisuel (Ina-GRM) in Paris (France). He taught acousmatic composition at the Conservatoire of La Rochelle, a course of electroacoustic music composition at the Conservatoire of Cherbourg in 2003 by means of the DRAC Basse-Normandie, and was active as an instructor in the CeFEDeM in Normandy. He participated on international juries for acousmatic composition competitions in France and abroad. Two distinct esthetic periods characterized his work. During the first, from 1977 to 1987, he placed an emphasis on the ties unifying acousmatic music and painting, ties arising from the use of a common permanent working surface which permitted the painter to directly place his colors on the canvas in the way the composer immediately captures sonorities on 'magnetic tape'. He expressed this analogy and attempted to explore its ramifications in virtually all the works of this period (M√©tamorphose d‚Äôun jaune citron, 1978, Bleus et formes, 1981...). In the second period, from 1987 to the present, following upon this initial preoccupation, he presented the idea of a ‚Äòspatial polyphony‚Äô (a ‚Äòpolyphony‚Äô of spaces and not uniquely of sounds). He inaugurated this path in 1989 with Espaces-paradoxes, composed for 16 channels of speakers. The concert works thus developed have as their objective the mastering and integration of the spatial dimension of the piece from the very beginning of its elaboration in the studio via adequate multi-speaker techniques.

In the United Kingdom the series is known as \\"Furnace\\". The books are written from the point of view of the teenage protagonist Alex Sawyer, and are about his incarceration in the fictional London prison Furnace Penitentiary. Escape from Furnace: Lockdown is followed by Solitary, Death Sentence, Fugitives and Execution. Smith followed up the series with a novella, The Night Children, which tells the story of the 17-year-old commissioned officer Kreuz (known as Warden Cross in the series) and his meeting with Alfred Furnace, the prison's founder, and his creatures in the Belgian woods during World War II.  Plot overview  Lockdown Furnace Penitentiary, in the distant future, is the world‚Äôs most secure prison for young offenders. It is buried a mile beneath the Earth‚Äôs surface. One way in and no way out. Once you're here, you're here until you die, and for most of the inmates that doesn't take long - not with the sadistic guards and the bloodthirsty gangs. Convicted of a murder he didn't commit, sentenced to life without parole, ‚Äònew fish‚Äô Alex Sawyer knows he has two choices: find a way out, or resign himself to a death behind bars, in the darkness at the bottom of the world. Only in Furnace, death is the least of his worries. Soon Alex discovers that the prison is a place of pure evil: where creatures in gas masks stalk the corridors at night, where giants in black suits drag screaming inmates into the shadows, where deformed beasts can be heard howling from the blood drenched tunnels below waiting to kill. And behind everything is the mysterious, all-powerful warden, a man as cruel and as dangerous as the devil himself, whose unthinkable acts have consequences that stretch far beyond the walls of the prison. Together with a bunch of inmates - some innocent kids who have been framed, others cold-blooded killers - Alex plans the prison break to end all prison breaks. But as he starts to uncover the truth about Furnace‚Äôs deeper, darker purpose, Alex's actions grow ever more dangerous, and he must risk everything to expose this nightmare that's hidden from the eyes of the world... Solitary Alex, Zee and Gary are on the loose in Furnace tunnels and caves but are eventually found by the warden, the blacksuits and their hounds. Alex and Zee are condemned to a month in the 'hole', the solitary confinement, while a wounded Gary is taken to the infirmary. In the pitch black hole, where all the worst nightmares come true, Alex and Zee manage to stay sane by communicating to each other by banging on the steel pipes and the frequent visits of Simon - he yanks them out of their cells and works with them and his friends in order to make an escape attempt: first through a steeple, later through the incinerator. In the prison's underground mazes Alex and Zee discover the dark truth: the inmates are lab rats; the wheezers perform procedures on them in order to become blacksuits but these experiments sometimes fail so they're either turned into 'rats' which seek only for food and revenge or 'mutants', half rats half boys, who are harmless because they remember their old lives. In the infirmary Alex finds Gary and Donovan (who is later smothered by a pillow) who are turned into blacksuits. Alex's second escape plan doesn't go smoothly either: Zee is taken to the infirmary but is later saved by Simon and Alex, the steeple doesn't lead to the outside but to one of the rats' lair and on their way through the incinerator Alex, Zee and Simon are caught by the blacksuits. Death Sentence Alex undergoes the blacksuit procedure, while Simon, Zee and Ozzie are locked up. With the 'nectar', a dark liquid full of tiny golden flecks, in his veins, Alex starts to forget things - his life prior and in Furnace, his friends and even his name - and what's left is a cruel, merciless hatred toward the weak and a lust for power. But to become a real blacksuit, he has to pass a test, in which he successfully kills many rats and Ozzie. As a new recruit, he finds out other secrets: the existence of the 'berserkers' (creatures that are bigger, stronger, more merciless and with no rational thoughts as the blacksuits), and the nectar - the essence of it (the darkness that lies in someone's fear of death) and the motives behind it (to create perfect soldiers without fear, pain nor pity). When he has to pass another test by killing Zee, Alex starts to remember his name so he attempts to escape for the third time along with Zee and Simon, this time through the elevator that connects the prison with the main gate. After a while, he starts to feel weak due to the lack of the nectar; without it he can either become a boy again or completely lose his mind and become a merciless killer, worse than a berserker, but Simon takes care of it. In the prison's 'gen pop' they and the other prisoners successfully defeat their enemies sent - first the blacksuits, later two berserkers - and reach the main gate. They are finally free. Hearing the police sirens, Alex, Simon and Zee run for it while in Alex's mind there's Furnace's voice screaming I am coming for you. Fugitives The inmates are on the run with the police and the SWAT on their heels, but are also chased by Furnace nightmarish creatures that carry the 'red-flecked' nectar - it has evolved into a plague, so the infected creatures or humans spread it by attacking and/or killing others. Trying to get as far away from the prison as possible, Alex, Zee and Simon hide first in a mall, later in the metro where they meet Lucy. After encountering some infected, Alex is bitten by a red- flecked berserker that causes him to teeter on the brink of insanity thanks also to Alfred Furnace's voice and visions - he wants Alex to be his right- hand man in the new 'Fatherland'. Soon they realize that the city is in a state of chaos and destruction, a war between Furnace's infected and humanity. After an attack of the infected in St Martin's Cathedral that Alex, Zee, Simon and Lucy survive, they are brought by Annabel and another soldier to a supposed safe place of PMCs, later revealed as the blacksuits. During their short capture, Alex, Zee, Simon and Lucy discover another inconvenient truth: the red-flecked nectar has been created by Alfred Furnace and is more powerful than the warden's nectar, and the Furnace Penitentiary is not the only place where blacksuits are created. They decide to destroy Furnace's tower with Furnace and his creatures in it. When Alex comes to meet Furnace, he finds instead Warden Cross who fills himself with the red-flecked nectar. He fights Alex but is eventually defeated. Drinking from Cross' blood, Alex becomes a berserker. On the tower's roof while the building is being bombarded, Alex promises to find and kill Furnace. Execution Alex is brought by the army, along with Zee, Simon and Lucy, to St Margaret's hospital where he, Simon and other Furnace creatures are studied by Panettiere and others while the plague's spreading through and out of the country. During the experiments, Alex drifts in and out of sleep where he experiences Furnace's memories. With Zee's visit, Alex realizes that he's expendable - he doesn't have any information about the nectar reproduction/annihilation or the whereabouts of the culprit. So Panettiere kills him but is resurrected by Sam. After Cross' death, Alex's considered Furnace's right-hand man, therefore, Sam and some berserkers help him and his friends to escape. With Panettiere and her army on their heels (they want to study Zee's immunity to the nectar), they spend the night in Alex's house, where he finds out that his parents haven't abandoned him as he remembers but have been trying to get him out of prison, and then they finally reach the island where Furnace is. At last, Alex meets Furnace who's still alive by being attached to a machine and wants Alex to be his heir - Alex is the only one who could handle the nectar and remember his history, and that's what the Stranger needs to survive. He accepts Furnace's offer, in doing so Alex's nectar is replaced by the Stranger's blood in Furnace's veins. Furnace is turned to dust and the Stranger manipulates Alex in continuing the war. However, with his friends' support Alex ends it by killing all of Furnace's creatures, including Simon, through telepathic images of freedom and peace. When Panettiere finally reaches them, she receives all of Alex's blood and dies while Alex's saved by receiving a nectar transfusion. Alex, Zee and Lucy are then brought to a military base where he's interrogated about what's happened. As time passes, the three of them and the whole world are trying to live a better, normal life, and Alex goes under the knife in order to become human again.  Main characters  Alex Sawyer - The main protagonist, 14 years old. Despite a young age, he makes many bad choices: he becomes a bully with two other kids, a thief and a liar. After a burglary, he is framed for the murder of his best friend and is sent to Furnace with no possibility of parole. With a bunch of inmates he tries to escape twice, but fails. After the second attempt he is turned into a blacksuit, and during a test to prove himself as a black suit, he kills Ozzie. However, he remembers his name and he successfully makes the third escape along with all of the prisoners of Furnace. He is on the brink of insanity due to the nectar running through his veins, but with his friends' help he manages to stay true to himself. After the escape he's infected with a new type of nectar, defeats Warden Cross and is turned into a berserker. After escaping the army who wants the nectar for themselves, he kills Furnace by becoming his heir and receiving the stranger's blood in Furnace's veins. Taking control of the war, he manages to end it by killing all of Furnace's creatures with his friends' help. He then escapes Furnace. Zee Hatcher - One of Alex's closest friends, sent to Furnace at the same time as Alex. He is framed for driving into an older woman and prior to Furnace, he used to steal cars. He's immune to the nectar: to the warden in Death Sentence he's of no use (he is unable to be turned into a blacksuit), while the army in Execution is very interested in him (he could hold the key to the cure). Carl Donovan - Alex's cellmate, 16 years old, one of the first to be brought to Furnace. At 11 years old he murders his mother's lover with a candlestick - he couldn't bear his mother's beatings. In Lockdown he acts as a guardian angel for Alex, although he is loath to admit it, and takes part in the escape plan until he is taken away in the blood watch. In Solitary he is turned into a blacksuit and is killed by Alex. Throughout the whole series, Alex still thinks of him and has imaginary talks with him. Simon Rojo-Flores - A failed mutant who assists Alex and Zee with and after their escape plan from the hole. He is sent to Furnace because he accidentally murders the owner of a jewelry store during a robbery. He dies at the end of Execution. Lucy Wells - A girl who tags along with Alex, Zee, and Simon after they meet in Fugitives. Her father was a policeman who was killed during the Summer of Slaughter, therefore, she hates them at first. Warden Cross - One of the main antagonists whose eyes are so full of madness, hatred and rancid glee that meeting them is like watching yourself die a million times over. He is over 100 years old, and was 'adopted' by Furnace during WWII. Since then, he has regularly taken the nectar. In Furnace Penitentiary, he has control over the wheezers, blacksuits, prisoners and other creatures. He takes orders only from Alfred Furnace, often referring to himself as Furnace's 'right-hand man'. Due to Alex's rebellion against him, Furnace attempts to use Alex as Cross's replacement. Warden Cross is eventually drained of his own blood by Alex and fed to the wheezers in Fugitives. Alfred Furnace - He is the founder of the Furnace Penitentiary and the main antagonist in the series. He communicates telepathically with Alex and the other creatures through the nectar but he appears only in Execution. Having been born in Hungary in the 18th century - thereby making him over 300 years old as of the events of the story - and has experienced this enhanced lifespan due to his usage of the Stranger's blood, the base product of the nectar. When he was a boy, he was framed for murdering his younger brother J√≥zsef - the real killer was the Stranger - and was crucified by the townspeople; instead of death he choose the Stranger's offer, receiving immortality through the Stranger's blood. For centuries, he traveled across Europe, creating soldiers with his nectar in order to make a world in which there is only strength and equality. However, Furnace isn't in control of his actions but is controlled by the Stranger. In Execution he finally dies and is replaced by Alex.  Side characters  Sam The Blacksuit - A blacksuit who turns out to be assisting Alex while he is in the base in \\"fugitives.\\" General Hamilton - A general in Execution who gives Alex, Zee and Lucy a lift from the island to a military base. Monty - An inmate that shows up the same time as Alex. At first he is aloof and shows no warmness to Alex even after he saves his life during a skirmish in the trough room but at the end repays the kindness by making him, Donovan and Zee a legitimate meal using leftovers in the kitchen. He is taken by the blood watch and turned into a blacksuit - he murders Kevin. At the end of Lockdown, he saves Alex from Moleface and dies. Seconds before his death however, he tells Alex, \\"Never forget your name\\", and this would save Alex from turning into a complete monster many times later in the series. Alex and Monty seem to be the only characters in the series who remembered their names after being turned by the nectar (excluding Warden Cross). Toby Merchant - A boy who arrives at Furnace shortly after Alex and is framed for murder as well. In Lockdown he attempts to commit suicide along with Ashley but is saved by Alex. He helps Alex, Donovan and Zee with the escape plan, but during the escape he is badly wounded by the explosion. In Lockdown he dies during the attempted escape. Moleface - A blacksuit with a small mole on the chin. He is the one who frames Alex for murdering his best friend. Skulls - One of the many gangs in Furnace, particularly cruel to \\"new fish\\". Gary became their leader in \\"Lockdown\\". Fifty-Niners - One of the gangs responsible for the Summer of Slaughter and one of the first to come to Furnace Rats - Furnace inmates who undergo the procedure to become blacksuits; experiment fails. They completely lose their mind due to the pain caused by the procedure and are always in search for food, including human's flesh, and revenge against the blacksuits and the warden. Jimmy - He is framed for murder at the same time as Alex, Zee and Monty. In Lockdown he wants to escape with Alex, Zee, Toby, and Gary but fails and rats them out. His fate is unconfirmed - probably dead. Ashley - A boy who upon arriving at Furnace, commits suicide. Carlton Jones - Zee's cellmate in Lockdown. His fate is unconfirmed - probably dead. Brandon - One of Alex's friends prior to Furnace. His fate is unconfirmed - probably dead. Toby - Prior to Furnace, Toby was Alex's best friend and partner-in-crime who loved Elvis Presley. During a burglary, Toby is shot and killed by Moleface.

As a member of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde, while assigned to the Neuengamme concentration camp, he was given the task of murdering the victims of a tuberculosis medical experiment conducted by Kurt Heissmeyer. SS career Strippel served in various concentration camps starting in 1934, when he joined the SS. His first assignment was at Sachsenburg, his next was Buchenwald, where he participated in the shooting of 21 Jewish inmates on November 9, 1939, following the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler in Munich. While at Buchenwald, Strippel caught an inmate who was using a rope and some paper to alleviate heavy loads he was carrying on his work. This was against camp regulations (stealing Third Reich property), so Strippel decided to make an example out of him. \\"You used this rope; you'll hang on a rope. And the whole camp will watch as you twist in the wind.\\" The inmate's hands were tied behind his back and he was lifted two feet off the ground from a tree. The weight of his body was all on the shoulder joints and the pain was \\"excruciating beyond all description.\\" Strippel's next assignment from March to October 1941 was the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Occupied France. Strippel then served in Majdanek near Lublin Poland, Ravensbr√ºck, then at Peenem√ºnde on the Usedom peninsula, in the Karlshagen II forced labor camp, the site of V-2 rocket production and launches. From there the 's-Hertogenbosch concentration camp in Vught, the Netherlands, more commonly known as Camp Vught. His final assignment was at Neuengamme. Trial and conviction Strippel was convicted of war crimes at the Third Majdanek Trial before the West German Court in D√ºsseldorf (1975‚Äì1981) for his actions at Buchenwald and at the Majdanek concentration camp, Poland, where he served as deputy commandant (Case no. 145 & 616 in Frankfurt District Court).

They were divorced in January 1876, in Androscoggin, Maine.Maine Divorce Records, 1798-1891. Docket Number: 133; Court: SJC; Vol/Pg: 15/64. Military career prior to the Camp Grant massacre Whitman was appointed Sergeant Major of the 23rd Maine Volunteer Infantry on September 20, 1862, and promoted to Captain March 1, 1863. He was honorably mustered out of the volunteer service on July 15, 1863. He rejoined the service as Major of the 30th Maine Volunteer Infantry on December 29, 1863, and was promoted successively to Lieutenant Colonel on 1 September 1, 1864 and to Colonel on 14 August 14, 1865. He was honorably mustered out of the volunteer service on August 20, 1865. He joined the 3rd U. S. Cavalry as Second Lieutenant on July 2, 1867, with a brevet rank of First Lieutenant, United States Army, for gallantry during his previous service in the Battle of Sabine Crossroads, April 8, 1864; regular promotion to the rank of First Lieutenant followed on August 12, 1869. Whitman retired from the army March 20, 1879. Whitman and the Camp Grant massacre Whitman was a 37-year-old first lieutenant when he assumed command of Camp Grant at the confluence of the San Pedro River and Aravaipa Creek about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Tucson. The area had previously been home to the Aravaipa Apaches before they had been driven from it by American settlers. In February 1871 five old Apache women straggled into Camp Grant to look for a son who had been taken prisoner. Whitman fed them and treated them kindly, so other Apaches from Aravaipa and Pinal bands soon came to the post to receive rations of beef and flour. Whitman also arranged for them to \\"earn their keep\\" by working as farmhands for the local ranchers as well as extracting a promise from them that none of the tribe would participate in any raids. That spring, Whitman created a refuge along Aravaipa Creek about five miles (8 km) east of Camp Grant for nearly 500 Aravaipa and Pinal Apaches, including Chief Eskiminzin. Whitman may have suspected that peace could not last. Other Apache bands were continuing their raids at this time, many of which were blamed on the Aravaipa at Camp Grant. He urged Eskiminzin to move his people to the White Mountains near Fort Apache, which was established in 1870, but he refused. On April 30, 1871, an angry mob of citizens from Tucson and their O'odham mercenaries attacked the Aravaipa camp, killing 144 people. All but eight of the corpses were women and children, as the men had been off hunting in the mountains. The attack was made in retaliation for a Gila Apache raid in which six people had been killed and some livestock stolen. Twenty-seven children who were captured, were sold in Mexico by the O'odham. Lieutenant Whitman searched for the wounded, found only one woman, buried the bodies, and dispatched interpreters into the mountains to find the Apache men and assure them that his soldiers had not participated in the \\"vile transaction.\\" The following evening, the surviving Aravaipas began trickling back to Camp Grant. Many of the settlers in southern Arizona considered the attack justifiable homicide. Within a week of the slaughter a local Anglo businessman/merchant named William Hopkins Tonge (or Touge) wrote to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs stating that \\"The Indians at the time of the massacre being so taken by surprise and considering themselves perfectly safe with scarcely any arms, those that could get away ran for the mountains.\\"Colwell-Chanthaphonh, Chip. Western Apache Oral Histories and Traditions of the Camp Grant Massacre. The American Indian Quarterly - Volume 27, Number 3&4, Summer/Fall 2003, pp. 639-666. He was the first person to refer to what had taken place as a massacre. After the massacre, a trial was demanded by President Ulysses S. Grant, who threatened to put the state under martial law if the Governor failed to act. However, at the trial that occurred later in the year, the jury took just 19 minutes to acquit more than 100 defendants who were named in the attack. Later life Whitman retired from the army March 20, 1879. In later life he lived in Washington, D.C. There, on February 11, 1902 in her home at 1449 Massachusetts Avenue, he married Mary Miller Blood, daughter of Col. Ephraim F. and Catherine (Seymour) Miller and widow of poet Henry Ames Blood.\\"Social and Personal.\\" The Washington Post, Feb. 12, 1902, p. 7.

N. Reddy under his banner Vauhini Studios. N. T. Rama Rao and P. Bhanumathi star as a couple ‚Äì Nagaraju and Malliswari ‚Äì who are separated by Malliswari's greedy mother. Malliswari is sent to the king's palace according to the custom of \\"Rani Vasam\\", a tradition during the Vijayanagara Empire wherein young women were fetched to the palace with an offering gold and jewellery to their parents. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences faced by Nagaraju when he, against all rules, surreptitiously enters the palace to meet Malliswari. Reddy wanted to make a film based on Krishnadevaraya's character ever since his visit to Hampi for the filming of his debut Vandemataram (1939). He employed Devulapalli Krishnasastri to write the film's script and took inspiration from Buchibabu play \\"Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu\\" and Devan Sharar's short story \\"The Emperor and the Slave Girl\\". He also incorporated into the script a few incidents from his childhood for the pranks between Nagaraju and Malliswari. S. Rajeswara Rao composed the film's music, Adi M. Irani and B. N. Konda Reddy provided the cinematography, H. R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film, and A. K. Shekhar was the film's production designer. The production phase of Malliswari lasted for two years and the film was released on 20 December 1951. It opened to a tepid response at the box office, but soon saw a growth in ticket sales due to favourable word of mouth. It grossed over 8 lakh (0.8 million) and was commercially successful. Malliswari was later screened at the 9th International Film Festival of India and the 1952 Peking film festival, making it the first Telugu film to be screened in an international film festival. B. N. Reddy planned to dub the film into English, but backed out due to budget considerations. Malliswari achieved cult status in Telugu cinema and is considered one of the best works of Reddy as a filmmaker. It became the first film script to be serialised in the magazine Vijayachitra, and a few universities in the United States wished to have the film's script as a part of their textual studies. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-IBN included Malliswari in its list, \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\".  Plot  During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, \\"Rani Vasam\\" was a common tradition that was considered a \\"boon\\" for young women. According to the tradition, young women were made the official residents of the palace when palanquins were sent to fetch them from their homes, offering large quantities of gold and jewellery to the parents in exchange. While the families of these women continue to cherish their daughters, these women were prohibited from having any contact with any male or letting any male visit them without permission. The ones who violated the rule were hanged. Nagaraju and Malliswari of Veerapuram are maternal cousins who became close friends in childhood. This angers Malliswari's mother Nagamma, who criticises Nagaraju and his mother Govindamma, mainly for their economic status. Malliswari's father Narappa, also the village head, is a silent spectator, and her uncle Hanumanthappa is a minister in the court of Krishnadevaraya, the king of the Vijayanagara Empire. Once, Nagaraju and Malliswari visit the nearby village and take shelter in a mandapa at night during a rainfall. Krishnadevaraya and Allasani Peddana, along with a few soldiers, enter the same mandapa where there are impressed with Malliswari's talent as a singer and dancer. Nagaraju and Malliswari, unaware of their true identity, converse with them, and Nagaraju asks them to recommend Malliswari to Krishnadevaraya for Rani Vasam. Malliswari is against this and sees this as a prank by Nagaraju. While Nagamma is keen to send her to Rani Vasam, Narappa wants his daughter to marry Nagaraju. Nagamma voices her opinion which insults Govindamma and Nagaraju, who then decides to leave Veerapuram and earn money to convince Nagamma to approve his marriage to Malliswari. Nagaraju becomes a successful sculptor in Vijayanagara and decides to return to Veerapuram. However, before he can do so, Krishnadevaraya and his wife Tirumaladevi appoint Malliswari as the official resident of the palace, thereby granting her \\"Rani Vasam\\". Due to her insatiable desire for wealth, Nagamma forcibly sends Malliswari to the palace, and, when Nagaraju returns on the same night and learns what has happened, he becomes depressed. Govindamma becomes unstable after Nagaraju begins to lead the life of a recluse, mulling over his memories of Malliswari. A group of sculptors meet Nagaraju and ask him to accompany them to Vijayanagara to build a special mandapa for dancers, and he agrees. There, he meets Malliswari. They are separated by her maid Jalaja, who is afraid that they will be beheaded, as stipulated in the Rani Vasam tradition. Knowing about her past, Jalaja arranges a meeting of Malliswari with Nagaraju on the banks of the Tungabhadra river at midnight. Krishnadevaraya and his ministry attend the newly constructed dance hall, where they learn that Nagaraju is one of the sculptors. That night, Malliswari wants to meet Nagaraju again but is held back after receiving a message that Krishnadevaraya and Tirumaladevi, along with other official residents of the palace, will be attending the play \\"Usha Parinayam\\" at the dance hall and that Malliswari is expected to participate in it. Nagaraju, who is waiting for her near the Tungabhadra river, enters the palace and is chased by the soldiers. Malliswari sees Nagaraju running and calls out to him. To prevent Malliswari from being hanged, Nagaraju acts as if he does not know her, but they are soon jailed for violating the rules of Rani Vasam. Jalaja reveals the love story of Malliswari and Nagaraju to Tirumaladevi. She also reveals that Malliswari denied any help from her and instead chose to die along with Nagaraju. The next morning, the hanging nooses are kept ready and the duo meet Krishnadevaraya before killing them. When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that it was he who had asked him to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their marriage is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.  Cast  * N. T. Rama Rao as Nagaraju * P.

At the sanctum sanctorum of this temple, B. N. Reddy decided in 1939 to direct a film where Krishnadevaraya would be the central character. This became the genesis of Malliswari. During the filming of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, B. N. Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture the beauty of the monuments, which reflected the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script. Reddy chose the concept of Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, a popular play written by Telugu novelist Buchibabu that was published in the literary journal Bharathi (1944) and later broadcast by All India Radio, Madras. He approached Telugu poet and playwright Devulapalli Krishnasastri to write the film's script and lyrics after being impressed with his previous works. Reddy made a few changes to Buchibabu's play and reworked Krishnadevaraya's character. Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script also took inspiration from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, which was published in the now defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Reddy's practice to credit the authors of works from which he borrowed the basic premise for a film, but in this film, that was not the case. Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Clip from 00:00:00 to 00:00:32. Adi M. Irani and B. N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H. R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A. K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him. N. T. Rama Rao was chosen to play Nagaraju, a sculptor during the period of Krishnadevaraya's rule. B. N. Reddy wanted to cast a fresh face for the role of Malliswari and screen-tested Kannada actress Revathi. He later finalised P. Bhanumathi, who played a negative role in his previous film Swarga Seema (1945), as the film's female lead, as he felt an experienced actress with a good voice would do better justice to the role. Revathi made a cameo appearance in the song \\"Poyi Ravamma\\". Differences arose between Reddy and Bhanumathi due to the latter's lack of punctuality. Due to the delay in production of Malliswari, Bhanumathi had begun working in Prema (1952), which was produced by her husband P. S. Ramakrishna Rao. As she sported a curly hairdo, a body double was used for a few sequences as it was in contrast to the simple and soft tresses she sported in this film. Regarding the same, Bhanumathi criticised Reddy, stating that he wanted his actresses to concentrate on his films and avoid getting married. Despite this, Reddy said that Rama Rao and Bhanumathi \\"made a cute on-screen pair\\", adding that one cannot imagine anyone else as Nagaraju and Malleswari. T. G. Kamala Devi, who played the role of Malliswari in Buchibabu's radio play, was cast as Jalaja, Malliswari's maid in the film. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the songs. Reddy incorporated a few of his childhood incidents in the film, and according to Bhanumathi, the pranks between Malliswari and Nagaraju and the sequence before the song \\"Kothi Bavaku Pellanta\\" were inspired by his childhood experiences. Apart from designing the sets, Shekhar took care of the artists' hair and costumes. He also recreated the shores of the Tungabhadra River on a floor a Vauhini Studios building in Madras for the song \\"Manasuna Mallela\\". The production phase of Malliswari lasted two years.  Music  The official soundtrack of Malliswari composed by S. Rajeswara Rao consists of 19 songs whose lyrics were penned by Devulapalli Krishnasastri. The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and P. V. Koteswara Rao. It was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and orchestrated by Addepalli Ramarao, who was, however, credited as one of the film's music directors in the opening credits. The song \\"Manasuna Mallela\\" was composed using the Kalyani raga. Purandara Dasa composition \\"Sri Gananatha\\" was used in the film's opening credits. Being a playback singer, Bhanumathi provided vocals for all the songs featuring her character Malliswari. Composing the soundtrack took six months and Rajeswara Rao held rehearsals for both Ghantasala and Bhanumathi along with others. The soundtrack, marketed by Saregama, was released on 31 December 1951. The soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In his review for Telugu Swatantra magazine, writer Aarudhra praised the film's sound designing by Krishnan and Koteswara Rao stating, \\"Heavy rain with winds lashed outside as [Malliswari]'s mother converses with her husband Nagappa. Their conversation is clearly audible along with the sound of the rain and the wind. Even the flutter of the towel on Nagappa's shoulder is heard clearly\\". In The Hans India, Aruna Ravikumar surmised that, for the song \\"Akasha Veedhilo\\", Krishnasastri had borrowed the image of a cloud as messenger between lovers from the poem \\"Meghasandesam\\" by Indian Sanskrit poet KƒÅlidƒÅsa. Rajeswara Rao considered Malliswari to be his best work after S. S. Vasan Chandralekha (1948). He especially liked \\"Akasha Veedhilo\\" and performed it numerous times at events he attended. After Bhanumathi's death in December 2005, K. V. S. Madhav of The Hindu recalled, \\"Even at the ripe age of 70-something, when she rendered her immortal number from Malleswari, 'Manasuna Mallela maalalugene...' in that honey-dipped voice, there was no eye that did not turn moist at Ravindra Bharathi almost a decade ago.\\" Track listing  Release, reception and legacy  Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha at Chikkadpally, Hyderabad where the film's 60th anniversary celebrations were held on 20 December 2011. Malliswari was released on 20 December 1951. Initially, it received a tepid response at the box office. However, ticket sales picked up due to positive word of mouth and the film became commercially successful. Reddy re-released the film after a gap, and it again achieved similar success. It was screened at the 9th International Film Festival of India under the \\"Indian Panorama\\" section. Malliswari was screened at the 1952 Peking film festival, making it the first Telugu film to be screened at an international film festival. Malliswari grossed over 0.8 million, which according to Reddy, was a huge amount in those days. Vasan advised Reddy to dub the film into Hindi. A 16 mm print was sent to the United States. After being screened in various countries, Reddy wanted to dub Malliswari into English. However, the plans were dropped due to budget considerations. Delhi Telugu Sangham screened the film at Azad Bhawan, New Delhi, on 21 February 2004. The 60th anniversary of Malliswari was celebrated with an event at the Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha, Chikkadpally, on 20 December 2011.  Critical reception  In his review for Filmindia magazine, Baburao Patel called Malliswari an \\"inspiring motion picture\\" which would \\"save us the blush when compared with the best of motion pictures of the world\\". Film historian Randor Guy called Malliswari a \\"poem in celluloid, told with rare artistic finesse, which lingers long in the memory\\". M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu wrote, \\"No wonder, the film took two years to complete, but what ultimately mattered was the quality of the product, an all-time classic of which the Telugu film industry is proud. It is a simple story, well told and represented by excellence in all sectors of film -craft [sic]\\". Regarding Bhanumathi's performance, Narasimham stated that she \\"breathed life\\" into Malliswari's character with her \\"natural acting and mellifluous renditions\\". In his book \\"Alanaati Chalana Chitram\\", K. N. T. Sastry wrote that Bhanumathi's expressions were \\"heavenly\\" and called Shekhar's production design \\"commendable\\". The directorate of the International Film Festival of India called Malliswari a \\"nostalgic film of kings and proud queens, baroque- style palaces and dancers, and ordinary mortals who dared to fall in love\\".  Digitisation plans  In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights of fourteen Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Malliswari, to release their digitally remastered versions in colour. Though the digitally remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful, Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining fourteen films including Malliswari, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them. Goldstone said furthermore that there were a number of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.  In popular culture  Malliswari is regarded as one of the cult classic films of Telugu cinema. It is one of the earliest Telugu films making use of Indian art and architecture and was followed by films such as Sankarabharanam (1980), Meghasandesam (1982), Ananda Bhairavi (1983), Sagara Sangamam (1983), and Rudraveena (1988). It was also the first film script to be serialised in Vijayachitra magazine. During the film's screening in the United States, a few universities requested the film's script as a part of their film study curriculum. Reddy considered Malliswari his best work as a filmmaker, and the film was recognised as such. Malliswari success led to Rama Rao's resurgence from a career slump. A 2004 Telugu film directed by K. Vijaya Bhaskar was also titled Malliswari and marked the debut of the British-Indian film actress Katrina Kaif in Telugu cinema. In January 2007, M. L. Narasimham included Malliswari on a list of films that have influenced society and Telugu cinema along with Mala Pilla (1938), Raithu Bidda (1939), Vara Vikrayam (1939), Bhakta Potana (1942), Shavukaru (1950), Peddamanushulu (1954), Mayabazar (1957) and Lava Kusa (1963). In May 2012, Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned Malliswari for the letter M in her list, \\"The A to Z of Telugu Cinema\\". Commenting on Midhunam (2012), actor and writer Gollapudi Maruti Rao stated, \\"Some movies might make money but a Malleswari, a Sankarabharanam, a Pratighatana and movies like them cannot be forgotten\\". On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-IBN included Malliswari in its list, \\"The 100 greatest Indian films of all time\\". The single \\"Hey Pillagada\\" from Fidaa (2017) is an adapted version of the song \\"Parugulu Teeyaali,\\" with the vocals of Bhanumati and Ghantasala.

This is a comprehensive list of the bird species recorded in Glacier National Park, which is in the U.S. state of Montana. The list is based on the Glacier Bird Checklist published by the National Park Service dated November 2015. The checklist contains 276 species, and an additional seven species have been added from eBird records through February 2020. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. Legend As listed in the Glacier Bird Checklist. * Occurrence ** SP=spring (March‚ÄìMay), S=summer (June‚ÄìAugust), F=fall (September‚ÄìNovember), W=winter (December‚ÄìFebruary) ** N=nests in park, E=found east of Continental Divide, W=found west of Continental Divide, A=occurs in alpine areas, I=Introduced species * Abundance ** ab=abundant, c=common, u=uncommon, r=rare, a=accidental (Because the NPS checklist does not numerically define the abundance codes, the eBird entries note only the seasonal records of the species except for obviously accidental ones.) Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Canada goose Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.

They have long, broad wings. Their bodies tend to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved in the case of the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. One species has been recorded in Glacier. *White-faced ibis, Plegadis chihi SP=a New World vultures Turkey vulture Order: CathartiformesFamily: Cathartidae The New World vultures are not closely related to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. However, unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carcasses. One species has been recorded in Glacier. *Turkey vulture, Cathartes aura; E, W, SP=u, S=u, F=u Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae *Osprey, Pandion haliaetus; ‚Ä¢ E, W, SP=u, S=u, F=u Pandionidae is a family of fish-eating birds of prey possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.

Beet sugar The first entrepreneurs to try to make sugar from beets in Utah were the Mormon pioneers in the early 1850s, who used machinery shipped from Liverpool, England, but their attempts to produce granulated sugar failed because they could not overcome the problems created by growing beets in alkali soils. Stayner studied the sugar industry in California. He was energetic, and using his property, he conducted experiments with sugar cane, sorghum cane, and sugar beets in Utah. In 1887, he produced the first 7,000 pounds of commercial sugar in Utah and received a $5000 award from the legislature for doing so. With the support of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and other business leaders, he formed the Utah Sugar Company in 1889 with 20 stock holders. This company was ultimately instrumental in the building of a $400,000 beet sugar factory, constructed by E. H. Dyer in 1891 at Lehi. The company was so successful that it encouraged the building of other factories in Utah and Idaho that resulted in great economic growth in the two states from the research and the manufacturing of sugars and sugar syrups. Death and legacy Stayner became a prominent citizen of Salt Lake City. He died on 4 September 1899, from sepsis stemming from a lead pellet which became embedded in his heel. Although amputation of his limb was considered by a physician, the infection had permeated his body and it was too late to save him. Although Stayner was not interested in financial gain from sugar manufacture, because of his energetic work he is regarded as the \\"father and founder of the movement that made the manufacture of sugar in Utah a success.\\" See also * Deseret Manufacturing Company * Utah-Idaho Sugar Company Notes External links *The Sugar Beet Industry and Economic Growth in the West Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:1835 births Category:1899 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Utah ","title":"Arthur Stayner"},{"id":"26186464","text":"Skee's Diner, also known for a time as Jude's Place, is a historic diner in Torrington, Connecticut. Located for many years at Main and Elm Streets, it was probably built in 1920 by the Jerry O'Mahony Diner Company, and is believed to be the oldest diner of that company in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. In 2013, it was removed from its site by the Torrington Historic Preservation Trust for restoration, and eventual relocation to another site. Description and history Skee's Diner is a barrel-roofed diner wide and long, framed out of metal and wood. It has entrances at the ends, and in a projecting barrel-roofed vestibule at the center of the long front. Bands of single-sash windows extend across the rest of the front, topped by decorate segmental arch panels. The roof is formed out of tongue-and-groove boards and covered in rolled asphalt. The interior's original finishes include ceramic tile (black and green), and a long tan marble counter with seventeen stools and builtin display cases. and By its design, it is estimated to have been manufactured around 1920 by the Jerry O'Mahony Diner Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey, a major manufacturer of diners between the 1910s and 1955. Originally located in Old Saybrook, it was purchased by three men and moved to Torrington in 1944, escaping a war-time moratorium on new construction. It is believed to be the oldest O'Mahony diner in the state. It was at first named Rudy's, after one of the three owners, and was placed on land rented from the adjacent Church of St. Maron. It was soon acquired by Tony Cisnowski, whose nickname \\"Skee\\" was applied to the establishment, and his brother Edmund. They operated the diner until 1975, when they sold it to Judith Belmonte. She operated it under the Skee's name and as \\"Jude's Place\\". The diner was eventually purchased by the church, which rented it out to other operators. It was permanently closed in 2002. After standing vacant for some years, it was acquired by the Torrington Historic Preservation Trust. In April 2013, the structure was moved from its Main Street location, with the intention that it will be restored and reopened in a different location.

Description and history The former Warrenton Woolen Mill Complex is located north of downtown Torrington, on the west bank of the East Branch Naugatuck River. It is accessed from Main Street, which parallels the river on the east bank, via a drive that crosses the river. The mill consists of two large brick buildings, one two stories in height and the other three, connected by other structures. The site includes eight buildings in all, most of which date to the early 20th century. The two main mill buildings, each more than in length, are set parallel to each other in a north-south orientation, and exhibit modest commercial Italianate style. A large portion of the weaving shed is topped by a saw-tooth roof. The mill site was first used for textile production in 1844, and its investors included members of the prominent Wolcott family. This complex was built in 1908 to designs by prolific mill designer Charles T. Main, and are his only known work in the state. The complex was used for textile production until 1984.

The galaxy is located at the distance of about 42 kpc from the Sun and moves towards the Sun with the speed of 120 km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an approximately round shape with the half-light radius of about 51 pc. Bootes II is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way‚Äîits integrated luminosity is about 1,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ‚àí2.7), which is much lower than the luminosity of the majority of globular clusters. However the mass of the galaxy is substantial corresponding to the mass to light ratio of more than 100. The stellar population of Bootes II consists mainly of moderately old stars formed 10‚Äì12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these old stars is low at , which means that they contain 80 times less heavy elements than the Sun. Currently there is no star formation in Bootes II. The measurements have so far failed to detect any neutral hydrogen in it‚Äîthe upper limit is only 86 solar masses. Bootes II is located only 1.5 degrees (~1.6 kpc) away from another dwarf galaxy‚ÄîBo√∂tes I, although they are unlikely to be physically associated because they move in opposite directions relative to the Milky Way. Their relative velocity‚Äîabout 200 km/s is too high. It is more likely associated with the Sagittarius Stream and, therefore, with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG).

D. B. Bryan. Reprinted many times, the story was published in the June 2, 1962 issue of The New Yorker. During the story, an exam taken by the protagonist is explicitly dated as June 7, 1962. Plot Summary Phillip Sadler Wilkinson, a 14 and 15-year-old student at Virginia Preparatory School (V.P.S.) has been held back for three years because of his failed Latin exam. Phillip, or P.S. as he's known to his friends and other students, claims he's studied but has very bad studying habits and is easily distracted. VPS has a long tradition of students, all bound by an honor code which requires students to report misdeeds like cheating - their own and those of others. For the third year in a row, his Latin teacher, Dr. Fairfax, gives P.S. the exam. P.S. is desperate to pass, in order that he not displease his father, himself a VPS graduate, as were previous generations of Wilkinson men. During the exam, P.S. finds a \\"cheat-sheet\\" in his desk, and uses it. P.S. is sure that no one saw him cheat, not even his friend, \\"Jumbo\\". After the exam, P.S. feels guilty but doesn't tell anyone. He smokes a cigarette in bathroom while contemplating what he has done. P.S. decides to live with his guilt. Nevertheless, P.S. soon learns that he was spotted cheating by Jumbo who, following the honor code, reports him, and P.S is asked by Dr. Fairfax to come with him to the Honor Court where other Honor Committee members are there as well. At a school \\"honor court\\" P.S. is found guilty of cheating and is expelled from VPS. P.S.'s father picks P.S. from school. He is both disappointed with his son's actions and also confused by them. The two leave school together. The story suggests that despite P.S.'s misdeeds and punishment, an emotional gulf between the two is now more likely to be linked.

Evans was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He rose to the rank of vice-admiral during his career, which involved service in the First World War. Biography Evans was born in South Africa, the second son of Dr E. W. Evans. He spent his formative years in South Africa before the family returned to England, where he was educated at Horris Hill School before joining the Royal Navy. Evans was taught aboard the training ship HMS Britannia, and was appointed a midshipman in 1900. He was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant in 1901, and to Sub-Lieutenant in 1903. In 1905, he was promoted to lieutenant. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander in 1914, and fought at the Battle of Jutland, serving as flag-lieutenant to Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Leveson. He was promoted Commander in 1917, and was appointed an OBE in 1919. He was promoted to captain, to rear-admiral and finally to vice-admiral.

Life Claudine was the daughter of Blanche del Caretto and Catalan Grimaldi. She was the only child of her father, and thereby his heir. The succession of Monaco was regulated by her paternal grandfather Jean I, who allowed for female succession provided that a female heir kept her own name Grimaldi after marriage and passed it on to her children, and that her husband should take the name and arms of his wife. Claudine's position as heir to the throne of Monaco was further secured by her father. In his will, he stated that he was to be succeeded by his daughter Claudine who (to adjust to the will of his father that a female ruler was not to result in a change in dynasty), was to marry her cousin Lamberto, Lord of Monaco, to ensure that the Grimaldi family should keep the throne of Monaco and avoid a change in dynasty. He further appointed his mother Pomellina Fregoso regent of Monaco until his daughter's majority and, in the event of Pomellina's death, that his brother-in-law Pierre Fregoso should succeed her as Claudine's regent until her majority. Lady regnant of Monaco In July 1457, Catalan died when Claudine was at the age of six, and her paternal grandmother Pomellina Fregoso duly became regent of Monaco in accordance with the written will of her son. However, Claudine's fianc√© Lambert opposed the will and demanded part of the regency, and his demand was supported by the population. On 20 October therefore, Pomellina saw herself forced to sign a statement in which she was to share the power of regency with Lambert. Pomellina then prepared to have Lambert ousted and killed in a coup in collaboration with Pierre Fregoso and Pierre Grimaldi, Lord of Beuil, the latter of whom she promised to make the father-in-law of Claudine. In March 1458, the plot was staged, but Lambert managed to escape: with the support of the population of Menton and Roquebrune, he deposed Pomellina's regency government, confined her to her house in Menton, and had himself declared sovereign Lord as well as the regent and possessor of the rights of Claudine. Lady consort of Monaco The rights of Claudine was rather blurred. Lambert regarded himself as having conquered the throne of Monaco and he had legally taken possession of Claudine's rights with public approval, and Claudine was thus no longer regarded as ruler in her own right but was essentially deposed. The dynastic marriage between Claudine and Lambert was regardless to take place, but was postponed because of the young age of the bride. On January 1460, a plot staged by Pomellina, Pierre de Beuil and the count de Tende (again with Claudine and her dynastic rights in the center) resulted in an attack on Monaco and Lambert's rule, which failed. The marriage between Claudine and Lambert took place on 29 August 1465 in Vintimille. The marriage between Claudine and Lambert has traditionally been described as a happy one. There is not much information about whether she ever participated in politics during her tenure as lady consort. In 1483, however, Lambert saw it necessary to obtain the consent Claudine of his rights to govern and regulate the will of succession after his death. This was in effect her renunciation of her rights and her consent to Lambert's use of them. Nevertheless, Lambert did include her name when he proclaimed his sovereignty over the rebellious province of Mentone, which was not completely subdued until 1491. Later life Upon Lambert's death in 1494, their son Jean became Lord of Monaco as Jean II. Claudine outlived Jean, who was murdered in 1505 by his brother Lucien, the subsequent lord. According to tradition, Claudine was present during the murder of her son by her other son. She is said to have mourned Jean openly after his death, thereby demonstrating her opinion about his murder to his murderer and successor, her own son Lucien. Claudine died in 1515 during Lucien's reign. In her will, she stated that her rights to the three provinces of the Lordship of Monaco was to be passed on to her children in accordance with the succession order stated in the will of her father and grandfather, securing female succession on condition that it did not result to a change in dynasty: she also reinstated her granddaughter Marie Grimaldi (daughter of Jean II) in the succession, despite Lucien having forced her to renounce her claims upon her marriage. As Claudine was not regarded as a ruler since 1458, the fact that she could make a will of her rights to the throne, regulating succession, is curious fact in regards to her legal position.  Issue  Claudine had at least six children; *Jean II (1468 ‚Äì 11 October 1505) *Louis (deemed insane and barred from the inheritance) *Blanche Grimaldi, married in 1501 to Honor√© (baron de Tourette) de Villeneuve d'Espinouse, co-regent for Lucien's son Honor√© I, Lord of Monaco with Nicolas Grimaldi in 1532. *Augustino, Bishop of Grasse (1482 ‚Äì 14 April 1532) *Francesca (d. before 1523); married Luc Doria.

It is located in Sandholm, Blovstr√∏d, Aller√∏d Kommune. Children and young people under 18 who have fled alone are received at Center Gribskov. It is a former military barracks and the largest reception center for asylum seekers in Denmark. The center's daily operations are run by the Danish Red Cross. It also serves as both a receiving and departure center, for newly arrived asylum seekers, and asylum seekers who have been rejected; however, this later group will eventually be moved over to the Sj√¶lsmark deportation camp. Separated from the Red Cross facility, Sandholm also offers a branch of the Immigration Service, the National Police Immigration Department, and Elleb√¶k, a penal institutions for detained asylum seekers. History The barracks in Sandholm were designed by the Danish architect Viggo A. Thalbitzer, and listed as significant, along with many other army barracks in Zealand, after the Act of 1909. In 1945, German refugees were held in the camp under supervision until their transfer. From 1945‚Äì85, it housed the Danish Royal Life Guards. On October 1, 1989, it was taken over by the Danish Prison service, who got the right to use the first buildings in the Sandholm camp for asylum seekers. The camp belonged to the Copenhagen Prisons until 2005. In September 2015 a police officer was stabbed at the center by a Palestinian whose asylum request had been turned down. Facilities According to the Red Cross, one of the main tasks of the reception is to create a secure and tranquil environment for asylum seekers who have traveled far and long. \\"After months on the run, it is typically a meal, a bath, a comforter and a bed to sleep in\\". Police and the Immigration Service have offices in Center Sandholm and roles are clear. Police handle the registration of new asylum seekers, and the Immigration Service is responsible for examining the asylum application. Meanwhile, the Red Cross takes care of a number of basic humanitarian tasks. After months on the run, it is typically a meal, a bath, a comforter and a bed to sleep in. Applicants receive basic information about the asylum process in Denmark - and are offered a medical check. Special attention is paid to the most vulnerable, such as asylum seekers with trauma, victims of torture, families with small children or elderly people with impaired health. Center Sandholm also has a kindergarten, minding children while their parents go to interviews with authorities or resting. Center Sandholm houses approximately 500 residents. There are three types of accommodation: a building with family rooms and private bathroom, two buildings with 4-person rooms and common bathrooms and toilets in the corridor, and 6 new buildings with double rooms with private bathroom. There are also laundry, cafeteria, health clinic, residents' phones and various tenant-led activities, such as sewing, an info cafe, a women's group and bicycle workshop. Residents can either eat in the center's cafeteria, or receive money so they may cook for themselves. Asylum seekers are offered a short course in Danish and knowledge of Denmark for everyday use, which are taught in the center. School age children go to the Danish Red Cross' school in Lynge, or the local public schools. The Center Sandholm also has a playgroup and smaller club for older children. Despite all this the Center remains controversial. The conditions may not be as pleasant as they are made out to be. Many see the center as part of an inhuman immigration system which is systematically racist and discriminatory. They want it closed down. Demonstration On October 25, 2008, a group of protesters from CloseCamp marched from the Aller√∏d train station to Sandholm in protest. As with any political action like this there are difficulties getting to the truth, with reports taking sides. It is possible that there were as many as 2000 protesters, a minimum of 500. They claim to have followed police directions, and that the police reacted with unnecessary violence. It is clear that there were around 200 police sent to protect the center, who erected plastic barricades at some distance from it to prevent access. They fired teargas at protesters, which drifted back into the center. Protesters also claim that the police ran into them with their vehicles. The inner fence was breached in several places and the protesters deemed the protest a symbolic success. Other reports suggest that part of group, at least, were violent and provoked the police in order to distract attention from a smaller group who caused damage to the inner wire fence. This was signaled with purple plumes, and it was called into by megaphones to follow these plumes to the illegal part of the demonstration. The police have denied the accusations of excessive violence and say that the tear gas was appropriate in the situation, and that they were attacked by demonstrators. Criticism An asylum seeker in Sandholm appealed through a Facebook group for the action to be called off because most residents were worried and had come to Denmark to seek protection from war and violence. Centerleder Chemnitz from the Danish Red Cross said that the residents were insecure, especially families with children. Families were therefore offered to stay elsewhere, while the demonstration took place. Youth Red Cross called on the people behind the Action Close camp to engage in asylum policy by volunteering in asylum centers, a spokesman for the Action Close camp rejected this idea. Critics have noted that residents in the Sandholm camp are free to move in and out through the gate, so there should be no reason to cut a hole in the fence. Port Control prevents the unauthorized entry of outsiders only, to guard against drugs and prostitution. Sabotage against the S-Train The demonstration was two hours late because of vandalism of the S-train from Copenhagen. A signal cable at Lyngby Station was cut at approx. 10:45am, which resulted in the shutdown of the commuter train for several hours. A right-wing group who called themselves \\"Train Time\\" took responsibility for this action. They published a press release on the Nazi website DNF: \\"We have chosen to prevent and delay as many protesters as possible from reaching the refugee camp Saturday 25 10 08.

In particular, Lennox's work in the 1980s catalyzed a renewed interest in Aristotle's biology by arguing that his natural historical works are consistent with and even demonstrative of the scientific methodology he lays out in the Posterior Analytics. Lennox's work on teleology in the history of biology, particularly in the thought of Charles Darwin, has also been influential.See Lennox's invited contribution to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a review of this topic: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/darwinism/#SelAdaTel Canadian by birth, Lennox is a founding member of the Ayn Rand Society, affiliated with the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, and has served frequently on its steering committee.

While attending West Side High School he sang and played drums in rock, prog-rock, and funk bands.Clark, Alice. \\"Barrence Whitfield: Walk On The Wild Side\\", Loudersound.com, September 7, 2015. Accessed January 20, 2020. \\"Once at West Side High School he grabbed every opportunity to perform, 'from taking part in productions of Broadway shows and musicals to playing in soul and funk bands.'\\" 1970s‚Äî1980s In 1977, White enrolled at Boston University to study journalism. While in school, he worked in a record shop in Brookline, Massachusetts named Good Vibrations, where his singing was heard by musician Peter Greenberg of The Lyres. White adopted the stage name Barrence Whitfield to avoid being mistaken for superstar Barry White and began performing with Greenberg and former members of the Lyres as Barrence Whitfield & the Savages.[ Biography by John Dougan at AllMusic] The band garnered a strong reputation for explosive stage performances, described as \\"raucous and rough, in high gear from the moment they hit the stage.\\" Whitfield himself was described as \\"a soul screamer in the spirit of Little Richard, Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke, and early Don Covay.\\" In 1984, the band released their self- titled debut album, mostly comprising cover versions of obscure soul and R&B; songs. It received good critical reviews. The following year, they released a second album, Dig Yourself, on Rounder Records. Their music was heard by English radio DJ Andy Kershaw, who taped a Boston performance for airplay in Britain, and brought them to the UK for a tour. Whitfield released a third album, Call of the Wild, in the UK in 1987, featuring a new band line-up; an expanded version, retitled Ow! Ow! Ow! was later issued in the US. He toured widely in Europe, and won supporting slots on US tours with such artists as Bo Diddley, Tina Turner, George Thorogood, Robert Cray, and Solomon Burke. Back home Whitfield earned seven Boston Music Awards. A live album, Live Emulsified, recorded in 1987‚Äì88, was followed by the album Let's Lose It, produced by Jim Dickinson and issued in France. 1990s‚Äîpresent In the 1990s, Whitfield contributed tracks to Merle Haggard and Don Covay tribute albums, and recorded two albums with country music singer-songwriter Tom Russell. The album Ritual of the Savages was released in 1995. In 1997, he began working with a New Hampshire-based jump blues and rockabilly octet, The Movers. As well as continuing to perform in the UK and Europe, Whitfield has also contributed to film scores, including the 2007 film, Honeydripper. In December 2010, Whitfield, Peter Greenberg (DMZ, Lyres, Customs), and Phil Lenker (Lyres) were joined by Andy Jody (Gazelles!, Pearlene, Oxford Cotton, Long Gones) and saxophonist Tom Quartulli to perform two live shows and record a new Barrence Whitfield and The Savages record. That album, Savage Kings, was released on Spanish Label Munster Records and in the US on Shake it Records. In 2013 Whitfield signed with Bloodshot Records, on which he issued Dig Thy Savage Soul in September 2013. Whitfield again toured Europe, including an appearance on the BBC's Jools Holland Show. A followup, Under the Savage Sky, was recorded in January 2015 at UltraSuede studios and released in August of that year; Whitfield described the album as \\"giving the kids a musical karate chop to the head.\\"from an interview on Americana Music Show #262, published September 1, 2015. A third album for Bloodshot, Soul Flowers of Titan, was issued in 2018. Barrence Whitfield and the Soul Savage Arkestra: Songs from the Sun Ra Cosmos was issued by Modern Harmonic on May 3, 2019.

It is classified as a reactive fluid process, which produces shale oil by hydrogenation. The Hytort process has advantages when processing oil shales containing less hydrogen, such as the eastern United States Devonian oil shales. In this process, oil shale is processed at controlled heating rates in a high-pressure hydrogen environment, which allows a carbon conversion rate of around 80%. Hydrogen reacts with coke precursors (a chemical structure in the oil shale that is prone to form char during retorting but has not yet done so). In the case of Eastern US Devonian shales, the reaction roughly doubles the yield of oil, depending on the characteristics of the oil shale and process. In 1980, the HYCRUDE Corporation was established to commercialize the Hytort technology. The feasibility study was conducted by HYCRUDE Corporation, Phillips Petroleum Company, Bechtel Group and the Institute of Gas Technology.

One of the huge genus of Russula, it is found in conifer forests across Europe and North America. Mildly flavoured, it is edible and consumed in Central Europe. Description The cap is almost shaped like a sphere at first, and soon becomes flattened or depressed. The cuticle is shiny, varies in color, but is usually brown and tinged with violet, purple, yellow, or green. The gills are thick, widely spaced, easily crumbled into small pieces, white at first and then turns bright yellow eventually. The stipe is thick and white, but stains yellow or russet with age. The flesh is white, very firm, and has a mild flavor. The spore print is yellow-ochre, broadly elliptical, and has amyloid warts. The cap is 3 to 5 inches broad and the stipe is 1.5 to 2.5 inches long. Edibility The authors of The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms said that the species has a crunchy texture and tastes nutty. It is popular to eat in Northern and Central Europe. In Romanian, the mushroom is called p√¢ini≈üoarƒÉ (\\"little bread\\") due to its edibility and perceived taste and texture.DEX Online David Arora said that the species is good when it is young. There are species with unknown edibility that look similar to this species. According to an 1878 study, poisoning from this species used to be frequent, but is now rare. The study concluded that long cooking gets rid of its poisonous properties, but that rapid culinary processes does not such as roasting. In an 1871 handbook, British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke said that the flavor of the species is mild. Habitat David Arora said that species is widely distributed and can commonly be found scattered under conifers. and the authors of The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms said that the species can commonly be found in spruce forests or fir forests in the mountains. The species is rare in New York and can be found there in August.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It now houses professional offices. Description and history Villa Friuli is located northwest of downtown Torrington, on the west side of High Street at its junction with Central Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of terra cotta tile covered in stucco, and topped by a low-pitch hip roof. The roof is pierced by hip-roof dormers, and has extended eaves supported by paired large Stick style brackets. The facade is a symmetrical four bays wide, with a projecting single-story porch sheltering the center two bays. The outer first-floor bays have three-part windows set in segmented-arch openings, while the upper-level windows are sash, in pairs in the center bays and singly in the outer ones. and The house was built as a duplex in 1915 by John and Matthew DeMichiel, brothers who were among the first group of Italians to settle in Torrington. The house was designed by Ferruccio (Fred) Guarda, a draftsman working in an architectural firm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The DeMichiels established a contracting business, primarily in the cutting of stone, and their handiwork is evidenced in the house's interior. The brothers first major job was providing pillars for Torrington City Hall. John DeMichiel also became active in politics, representing Torrington in the state legislature.

For many years, she ran her own photographic studio in Aalborg, always keeping abreast of the latest developments. Among her clients were the Danish princesses Dagmar and Alexandra who were attracted by her photo enamel jewelry. Early life Born in Horsens, Jutland, she was brought up in a bourgeois home together with her sister and five brothers. Her father died when she was only six after which her mother earned a living as a milliner. After her mother's death in 1874, she went to Hamburg to learn photography. Living with her uncle, Poul Friedrich Lewitz, and her aunt Juliane, she became an apprentice to her cousin Alfred Lewitz, also a photographer.Frederikke Federspiel (1839-1913). From Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 1 February 2010. In her diary she records how much she enjoyed her year in Hamburg with many excursions, evenings at the theatre and wonderful meals.Tove Hansen: Kvindelige fotografer i Danmark f√∏r 1900. Fund og Forskning, Bind 29 (1990). From Tidsskrift.dk. Retrieved 14 February 2010. Working as a photographer After completing her apprenticeship in 1876, Frederikke Federspiel returned to Denmark where she was the first women to apply for a licence to trade in photography. She settled in Aalborg with her sister Sophie. While her sister exercised her trade in lingerie and embroidery in the living room, Frederikke set up a photographic studio on the top floor. There were already two photographers in Aalborg, one of whom was the well-established Heinrich T√∏nnies. She was aware of the competition but astutely publicized her business, always ensuring she kept up with evolving technology. For extended periods, she managed to run the second most prosperous photographic business in the city. In 1878, she fell ill and spent eight months in hospital followed by a further three months at St. Oluf's sanitorium in Modum, Norway. She was to return to the spa several times in later years. With her sister, she spent her summer holidays at the new seaside resorts of Blokhus, L√∏kken and Fan√∏. In 1883, Frederikke Federspiel and Nielsine Zehngraf from Randers were among the first women to become members of the Danish Photographers Association. Frederikke was an active member, contributing to the Association's membership album. In 1885, she won recognition for donating portraits. She also exhibited her work in Copenhagen, often participating in person as she did in 1888. In 1899, she started to produce enamel jewelry and cufflinks embedded with photographs using direct positives produced with a four-lensed multiplicator camera. She had made special arrangements for the equipment to be imported from the United States to facilitate the work. The jewelry was shown at a Christmas exhibition at Copenhagen's Industry Association, attracting the attention of the royal family. As a result, she was able to count Princess Alexandra and Tsaritsa Dagmar among her clients. Keeping abreast of technology Always interested in the latest technical developments, she was quick to start using dry plates which offered a safer and cheaper method of exposure and development. She was also one of the first to experiment with magnesium power for flash and she installed electric lamps in her studio when electricity came to Aalborg in 1901. In the early 1900s, she began to sell cameras for amateur photographers. Among her students and assistants were Ernst G√∏pel, Fritz Karner and Georg Bendtzen Holm who would later become leading photographers. Overall assessment Frederikke Federspiel constantly adopted developments in photography although, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of her studio, she stated that her business had not evolved as she had hoped. Nevertheless, when she died in 1913, the Dansk Fotografisk Tidsskrift (Danish Photography Magazine) characterized her as \\"an unusually likable, honest and energetic lady whose work has been counted among the best.\\" See also *Photography in Denmark *History of photography References Category:1839 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Pioneers of photography Category:19th-century Danish photographers Category:Danish women photographers Category:People from Horsens Category:19th-century women photographers ","title":"Frederikke Federspiel"},{"id":"26186792","text":"Livio Pin (born January 23, 1953 in Cappella Maggiore, Italy) was a professional footballer who during his career played for Perugia, Napoli, Udinese, Bologna and ≈ªurrieq, throughout his career he played as a midfielder.

Both during the four years he lived in Galileo's household and thereafter, Mazzoleni constructed instruments for Galileo, notably the military compass that Galileo invented and sold (along with an instruction manual written by Galileo). Mazzoleni would build more than 100 of these compasses for Galileo. Mazzoleni also helped Galileo produce other instruments, including hydrostatic balances, air thermometers, magnets and magnetic compasses for ships, and various kinds of drawing compasses for engineers and architects.

Pathai Village is a picturesque and scenic the lush green Western Ghats range of mountains in the south of India, in the state of Tamil Nadu. It is located near the town of Kalakkad and is about 58 km from Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin). The village is on the banks of the river - Pachaiyar (the green river/shyama Nadi in Sanskrit language). The village has temples dedicated to Lord Vasudeva, Lord Kulashekhara Mahalingam and Goddess Kulashekhara Nangai apart from many smaller shrines. The location in Google maps is Pathai Village Kulashekharanatha Mahalingam Temple The Kulashekharanatha Mahalingam temple is the ancient Shiva temple of the village of Pathai. The presiding deity of the temple is Shiva with the name - Kulashekharanatha Mahalingam with His consort ‚Äî Devi Sugandha Kuntalambika (Mattuvarkuzhali in Tamil language). The Devi shrine is in a separate sanctorum. The Shiva Mahalingam is unique with five-faced as is the Lord Himself. Main entrance showing Bali Peeta, Dwajasthambha and Nandi Mantapa Apart from the main deities, there are separate shrines for Shri Ganapathy, Subrahmanya with His consorts - ShriValli and Devasena, Chandikeshwara, Shanaischara (Shani/Saturn God)and Kalabhairava on the outer corridor or the prakaram(outer courtyard) around the main Sanctorum. Dakshinamurthy or the South facing Universal Teacher avatar of Shiva is on the south side of the outer wall of the Sanctum Sanctorum of the main deity as per the tradition. An intricately carved Nandhi or the Sacred Bull, the divine mount of Lord Shiva, sits facing the main deity ‚Äî Kulashekharanatha Mahalingam. Another Shiva Lingam is present in a separate shrine near the main deity in the temple proper. This God is known by the name - Tripurahareshwara with His consort - Tripurasundari in a separate neighboring sanctum. These two shrines are located at a slightly lower level than the plinth of the main Sanctum Sanctorum and hence is known by the name - Pallathudayar in the Tamil language, meaning the one in lower level. This Lord is known to bless copious rains in the area when his Sanctum is filled with water and offered special prayers even in the severe droughts. The Dwajasthambham or the Flag pole, unique with a Nandhi at its apex, stands at the main entrance as is the tradition. History of the Temple The temple is a unique blend of the three major regional influence ‚Äî the three major rulers of the South India - Chera dynasty ‚Äî as the Lord is known as the Lord of King Kulashekhara (Kulashekhara Natha) - Chola dynasty ‚Äî the Goddess is known by the same name - Sugandha Kuntalambika - the Consort of Lord Matrubhuteshwara at Tiruchchirapalli in the heart of Chola land - Pandya dynasty ‚Äî the temple located in the Pandya land with its unique architectural style. The Sthalapurana, or the history of the place, indicates that Lord Rama visited this temple en route to Lanka in search of His wife Sita. Local mythology says that the temple was covered in the forest in later years only to be discovered by a local ruler when a cow fell at the spot of the Lingam submerged in the land. When his men were clearing the area, hit something similar to a stone with his pick axe, resulting in blood gushing from it. The Lingam was found there and the local ruler built a temple, which transformed over the period of time to the present state. Present state of the Temple The Temple has many inscriptions on the walls waiting to be studied by the scholars to understand the hoary history of the temple and greatness of the shrine.Kumbhabhishekam/Consecration 31 January 1971 AD inscribed on the wall The latest inscription near the entrance after the Nandi Mantapa informs of the Consecration or the Kumbhabhishekam done on 31 January 1971 AD by the citizens of Pathai village. There are several Vahanam or the divine mounts in the temple indicating the festivals in the past with pomp and glory, but now in dilapidated condition. The processional idols or the Utsava vigraha are now kept in the Nellaiappar Temple in Tirunelveli, after a foiled theft attempt, for safe-keeping. With most of the young generation of the village moved out for occupation, the temple is in a very dilapidated condition, putting up a heart-rending picture with trees, weeds and plants growing on the temple structure, posing a severe danger of pulling it down. Worship is offered once a day by the priest coming from a neighboring place. Village manages to offer the Pradosham Puja/offering without fail. (The Thirteenth Evening twilight after the new moon, is considered is a very holy and auspicious day for the worship of Lord Shiva.) Efforts for renaissance People who have their nativity in this village, now spread all over the world and many parts within India, have started a forum - Kulasekara Nathar Devotees Forum - in a bid to revive the glory of the Temple ‚Äî as a way of giving back to their native society.

It is a democratic socialist organization that supports numerous progressive and radical causes in an effort to help build a broad-based, multi-tendency socialist movement. During the early years of the Socialist Party of America, the Chicago Socialist Party was one of the strongest locals in the country. Early years According to records at the University of Illinois at Chicago Library: \\"The Cook County Socialist Party was founded in 1896 as a response to the Pullman strike in Chicago. It held its first convention two years later. In 1901 it joined with other socialists parties in the state to form the Socialist Party of Illinois. The state party affiliated with the national party and its leader Eugene Debs and grew in membership throughout the first two decades of the twentieth century but declined after World War One.\\" After the Socialist Party unified in 1901, prominent socialist activists contended for control of Chicago Socialist Party; these included Algie Martin Simons, Barney Berlyn, Thomas J. Morgan and Seymour Stedman. 1973 reorganization In 2005 the CSP's charter was suspended due to several officers not paying their dues and who later left the Party. The charter was later reinstated once a functioning Local Executive Committee of members in good standing was elected.Socialist Party National Committee Minutes, March 2008 (accessed 14 May 2008). The CSP's long-term objective is to establish a radical democracy, a non-racist, classless, feminist, socialist society in which people cooperate at work, at home, and in the community and in which working people have control over their own lives. The CSP works cooperatively with numerous progressive and radical organizations and independent activists. While the Socialist Party regularly runs candidates for elected office, restrictive ballot access laws in Illinois result in few Socialist candidates running in that state, mainly as write-in candidates. The CSP functions primarily as activist organization, working in support of the labor movement, anti-war campaigns, prison outreach, and policy advocacy. Members have also been involved in educational efforts such as establishing radical resource centers and organizing forums, speakers, classes, film screenings, and book discussions on progressive and radical issues. In 2012 CSP members filed petitions to put the Socialist Party's Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander and Vice Presidential Candidate Alex Mendoza on the Illinois ballot under the state's \\"challenge rule\\" which meant that if no one challenged the petitions the Party would be on the November ballot. The Socialist Party's petitions, along with three other minor/independent parties were challenged by two members of the Illinois Green Party, Rob Sherman, Chair of the Cook County Green Party and Andy Finko, a lawyer who represents the Illinois Green Party. Despite pleas from Green Party Presidential candidate Jill Stein and other prominent Greens to drop the challenges, Sherman and Finko did not do so and the result was that the Socialist Party and three other parties were kicked off the ballot. In 2014 the Chicago Socialist Party joined with other socialists and activists to form the Chicago Socialist Campaign. The goal was to emulate the campaign of Kshama Sawant of Seattle and run a socialist candidate for Alderman in 2015. In May 2014 the Campaign chose Jorge M√∫jica, a long-time immigrant rights and labor organizer, to run for alderman in Chicago's 25th ward. In the March 2015 election Mujica, running as an open socialist, received 907 votes, 12.15% of the total vote.

He was also one of the original board of trustees and then later became president of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement.Flavier, Juan M., Doctor to the Barrios, page 6. Known for his notable achievements in Philippine government, particularly the creation of the Department of Commerce and Industry and his leadership in the establishment of the Asian Development Bank in the Philippines, Balmaceda was also a writer and a journalist.  Early Life and Schooling  Balmaceda was born on September 15, 1896 in San Miguel (now Sarrat), Ilocos Norte. The son of farmers, Santos Balmaceda and Crispina Agor, he became the only child after his four siblings died in infancy. He attended elementary school in Sarrat and the first three years of high school in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. He left for Manila when he was sixteen to finish his last year of high school in the Manila High School. Having been taught by American teachers who were sent to the Philippines to teach English when the Americans took over the country, Balmaceda became fluent in English.  Early career  For his first job, he was hired as a cub reporter in the Manila Times, a daily newspaper in Manila run by American journalists. In a few weeks he was given a regular beat as news reporter until he rose to be an editorial writer. Balmaceda was among the first five Filipino newspapermen who wrote in English. He enrolled in the University of the Philippines where he finished a degree in Bachelor of Arts in 1918. He was granted a government scholarship to study in Harvard University where he obtained an MBA, major in Foreign Trade in 1922. He finished a Law degree at the University of Manila in 1927 and passed the Philippine bar in December of the same year. He married Monica Jamias with whom he has seven children: Cornelio, Jr., Erlinda, Zenaida, Virginia, Gloria, Grace and Rose Marie.  Government work  In the Bureau of Commerce, he rose from Chief of the Editorial Section, then Head of the Commercial Intelligence Division, became Assistant Director, and was finally appointed Director in 1937. He founded and became a prolific writer and editor of the Commerce and Industry Journal where he urged the promotion and patronage of Filipino products which he called \\"a movement that deserves the full and active support of every citizen, Economic Nationalism, ...\\" He pushed for the formation of cooperatives to give the farmers a better market for their products. Under President Manuel Roxas, Balmaceda proposed the creation of the Department of Commerce and Industry and became its first Acting Secretary. Under President Elpidio Quirino, Balmaceda was appointed Secretary of Commerce and Industry and held this position for five consecutive years. Proposed by Balmaceda and launched in 1953, the Philippines International Fair was the biggest tourism project ever held in the Philippines. The Fair, headed by Balmaceda, occupied an area of 19.5 hectares of land bordering the Manila Bay - stretching to Intramuros and Taft Avenue in Manila -, and was a huge success.  Asian Development Bank  Balmaceda, as the Philippine Representative to the 9-nation Consultative Committee that conceived and formulated the measures for the establishment of the Asian Development Bank, was elected Chairman of the Consultative Committee. He said at the opening meeting: \\"It is the considered view of my government that the establishment of a regional bank for Asia and the Far East is one of the most significant and important, if not the most significant and important undertaking that the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has ever launched during its eighteen years of existence. My government is giving its full support and is prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent in bringing about the successful establishment of the proposed Asian Development Bank.\\"  \\"Why Manila\\" article  In his article, \\"Why Manila\\", Balmaceda explained how the location of the bank was determined: \\"The selection of the location of the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank will be based on the conditions obtaining in the proposed site that are most conducive to the smooth and successful operation of the Bank and the attainment of its objectives. ... The primary objective of the Bank is to help accelerate the economic development of the developing countries in Asia. To accomplish this, the Bank must not only know the hardships, problems and dreams of these countries, but must also look at these hardships, problems, and dreams through the eyes of these countries. The Bank must, therefore, be located in a developing country. ... Viewed and tested by the above criteria, Manila, Philippines, stands as the most ideal and the best location for the Bank, and I feel confident that the Ministerial Conference , after careful, objective, and impartial analysis and comparison of the actual conditions in the different cities being proposed, will reach the conclusion that the Philippines offers the best location for the Bank.\\" Balmaceda led the campaign among the Asian contending countries for Manila to get the site and won in the final ballot by just one vote over Japan. For his accomplishment, he was awarded the Presidential Award of Merit by President Diosdado Macapagal. Hailed as \\"Manila‚Äôs Golden Moment of Economic Diplomacy\\", Amando Doronila, columnist, wrote: \\"The success of that diplomatic campaign was made possible by two factors: the leadership of Commerce Secretary Cornelio Balmaceda and a diplomatic service infrastructure composed of veteran and competent diplomats, led by Foreign Secretary Mauro Mendez. Balmaceda was a top grade Cabinet minister of the old school of civil servants. He rose up the ranks of the bureaucracy. He had an impeccable integrity and was respected. He was never self-promoting ...\\" Balmaceda died at the age of 86, on April 17, 1982, barely four weeks after his wife‚Äôs death.  Legacy  Founded and established by his daughter, Grace Balmaceda, the Cornelio Balmaceda Foundation seeks to be an institution that will promote the ideals that Cornelio Balmaceda exemplified in his life. The CBF has become a family commitment to improve the quality of life in the rural communities through self-help and education, encourage cooperative enterprise, and to preserve family and Filipino cultural values. The CBF Scholarship Program launched in 2002 provides educational assistance to underprivileged but deserving students. Qualified students from the Sarrat National High School are enrolled at the Mariano Marcos State University in Batac, Ilocos Norte. Every year on the 15th of September, to commemorate the birthday of Cornelio Balmaceda, the Balmaceda family, composed of his children and grandchildren, go to Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, his hometown, and conduct medical and dental missions for the town folks, where volunteer doctors and dentists attend to their medical needs. Since this CBF Outreach Program started, more than a thousand people of Sarrat, mostly from the rural areas, have been given free medical check-ups and free medicines. The school teachers of Sarrat have also attended English workshops for faculty development and the school children have enjoyed feeding programs and received school material kits.  Senate Resolution  From the article of Ramon J. Farolan in the Daily Inquirer (May 21, 2012): \\"Some 45 years after Manila became home to the Asian Development Bank, the Senate adopted a resolution sponsored by Senator Franklin Drilon, recognizing the role of Cornelio Balmaceda, Secretary of Commerce and Industry, in the establishment of the ADB headquarters in the Philippines.

She was the first woman to be the Commissioner of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).  Early life  Pennefather was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied history and communications at Marianopolis College, McGill University, Concordia University and in the United Kingdom at the University of Oxford.  Career  Pennefather joined the NFB in 1977, working as a Sponsored Program Officer. In this capacity, she was responsible for producing films for various departments of the Canadian government, both in-house at the NFB and with independent production companies. In 1981, she was promoted to become the Executive Assistant to the Deputy Film Commissioner of the NFB, and two years later was appointed the organisation's Planning Co-ordinator. By the end of 1988, Pennefather was the NFB's Vice-Film Commissioner. When Fran√ßois N. Macerola left in December that year, six months before the end of his contract, Pennefather was appointed as acting Government Film Commissioner in his place. One of her main tasks during this interim period was to oversee the NFB's fiftieth anniversary celebrations in May 1989. On September 15, 1989, Pennefather was appointed as Government Film Commissioner and Chair of the NFB on an official basis. In 1992, Pennefather and the NFB hosted a pre-conference event entitled \\"It Matters Who Makes It\\", designed to discuss ways of improving the status of women in the media both on and off the screen, as part of the International Institute of Communications conference being held in Montreal. This event was attended by more than fifty women in the media from seventeen different countries. However, the same year Pennefather was forced to appear before the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs to defend the documentary series The Valour and the Horror, which the NFB had co-produced with Galafilm Inc. and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The series had been criticised by some veterans of World War II for its accusations of unprosecuted war crimes committed by Canadian troops. In 1993 she was presented with an Astral Award by the Toronto Women in Film and Television organisation, in recognition of her work to promote the role of women in the film and television industries. Pennefather left the NFB in December 1994. This was because she had applied for and been appointed to the position of chief executive officer of the National Arts Centre.

His father died three years later. Corvan was raised by his widowed mother who struggled to feed the family of four on her meagre earnings. After a brief career as a sail-maker Corvan joined Billy Purvis's Victoria Theatre. Here he tried his hand at a number of things, but found most success in the performance of local and comic songs. Ned then went on to join the Olympic where he enjoyed great success with songs such as 'Astrilly'. With this popularity he travelled the North singing his Tyneside songs, eventually settling in South Shields where he operated Corvan's Music Hall. After a number of years he gave up the establishment and returned to local singing. Playing successfully at concerts \\"of the free and easy type...not specially noted for their refinement\\", he was respected as \\"a really expert violinist\\" and \\"unequalled...as a comic singer of local ditties\\".\\"The Monthly Chroncle of North Country Lore and Legend\\", Walter Scott, 1891 He also \\"possessed very considerable gifts as an artist\\", often creating chalk likenesses of contemporary celebrities and local figures as part of his act.\\"The Monthly Chroncle of North Country Lore and Legend\\", Walter Scott, 1891 Corvan sang about survival on the edge of poverty and other working class experiences. He supported the seamen's strike of 1851 and gave money from his performances to seafarers charities. He sang not only for workers, but also \\"on behalf of- and in effect, from within- that network of communities\\" from which he came, and with which he still felt an attachment.Allan, T.

It is known from a lower jaw discovered in Upper Cretaceous rocks of northeastern Texas, United States. Description Aetodactylus is based on SMU 76383 (Shuler Museum of Paleontology, Southern Methodist University), a nearly complete lower jaw lacking the right retroarticular process (the bony prong posterior to the jaw joint), part of the posterior end of the mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw meet), and all but two teeth. This specimen was found in 2006 by Lance Hall near a construction site in Mansfield, near Joe Pool Lake (recorded as SMU Loc. 424). The rock it was found in is a calcareous marine sandstone rich in mud‚Äìsized particles, from the middle Cenomanian-age (approximately 97 million years old) Tarrant Formation. Also found were fish teeth and vertebrae, and indeterminate bones. The Tarrant Formation is the lowest rock unit of the Cenomanian‚ÄìTuronian‚Äìage Eagle Ford Group. Aetodactylus was named by Timothy S. Myers of SMU in 2010. The type species is A. halli, named in honor of the discoverer. Aetodactylus is differentiated from other ornithocheirids by several anatomical details of the lower jaw, including the slight expansion of the anterior end of the lower jaw, the strong vertical compression of the symphysis, the relatively constant spacing of the teeth, and the slight upward curve of the lower jaw. Myers found that Aetodactylus compared best with the Chinese genus Boreopterus. Aetodactylus represents one of the youngest definitive records of ornithocheirids. The jaw SMU 76383 is long, (~41%) of which is joined left and right jaws. 27 pairs of teeth were present; the two remaining teeth are pointed, curved slightly backward, flattened from side to side, and slender. The tip of the jaw is slightly expanded (to from a minimum of just posterior) and contains the first four pairs of teeth, with the first pair projecting forward. Based on the size of the tooth sockets, the teeth of the second and third pairs were largest, with tooth size decreasing posteriorly. There are small pits between the posterior teeth, interpreted as points where the teeth of the upper jaw rested against the lower jaw. These pits disappear partway along the tooth row, suggesting that the anterior teeth of the upper jaws were longer and projected outwards to a degree. Unlike some other ornithocheirids, such as Anhanguera, Coloborhynchus, and Ornithocheirus, there is no bony crest on the lower jaw. Aetodactylus was considered a possible relative of Boreopterus in the original description, but subsequent cladistic analysis found it to be closely related to Cimoliopterus instead. Classification Below is a cladogram by P√™gas et al. (2019), reassigning Aetodactylus to the clade Targaryendraconia within the more inclusive group Ornithocheirae, and more specifically to the family Cimoliopteridae:Rodrigo V.

His professional career started in 1901 when he signed for Scottish League Division One club St Mirren. He failed to make an appearance in his first season, but played twice in 1902‚Äì03, scoring one goal. He left in 1903 to join Division Two side Hamilton Academical, where he stayed for one season, playing five league games for the club.Wilson, David (1904), Hamilton Academical Memory Bank In 1904, he moved to England to join Football League Second Division side Bradford City. He made 12 league appearances and scored one goal in two years with the team, but left at the end of the 1905‚Äì06 campaign. Wilson signed for Lancashire Combination outfit Oldham Athletic in the summer of 1906 and became a first-team regular almost at once, playing 38 matches and scoring two goals in his inaugural season. For the 1907‚Äì08 campaign, Oldham joined the Football League Second Division, and Wilson appeared in every league match between 1907 and 1911. He scored two goals in the 1909‚Äì10 season as Oldham achieved promotion to the Football League First Division. He continued to play regularly until the outbreak of the First World War, when competitive football in England was stopped at the end of the 1914‚Äì15 campaign. On 5 April 1913, Wilson made his international debut for Scotland in the 0‚Äì1 defeat to England at Stamford Bridge, in which he played alongside his brother Andrew. After the end of the war, he kept his place in the Oldham side when the league recommenced, appearing in every match of the 1919‚Äì20 season. At the conclusion of the 1920‚Äì21 campaign, Wilson left Oldham Athletic, having played 368 league matches and scored 16 goals in a 15-year spell with the club. Wilson joined newly promoted Football League Third Division North team Nelson in 1921. He was appointed player-manager and handed the role of taking charge of the team's inaugural season in the Football League. He played 34 matches in his first season with Nelson and scored three goals, including one penalty kick, the first he had scored in his career. Wilson went on to play 30 league games in the following campaign, leading his team to promotion to the Second Division. He played a further 31 matches for Nelson before retiring from playing at the end of the 1923‚Äì24 season, at the age of 40. Management career Wilson continued as manager of Nelson despite his retirement but left the club at the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season, despite the team having finished as runners-up in the Third Division North. He subsequently spent three years working as a stockbroker, before having a spell in charge of Exeter City in the Football League Third Division South between March 1928 and February 1929. He was in charge of the team for 42 matches, with the side winning 11 matches, drawing 10 and losing 21. The club struggled under Wilson's tenure and finished 21st out of 22 in the division the season he left. He then spent a year in Germany coaching Stuttgarter Kickers.1929/30, Das Kickersarchiv (in German) Personal life After his retirement from football management, Wilson worked as a stockbroker.

Vicente in June, 1990. LRMS offers preschool, elementary, and secondary education. LRMS is currently under construction and is located in the Vista Verde Executive Village in Cainta, Philippines.  History  During the EDSA Revolution in 1986, activist Lydia C. Vicente witnessed the worsening of living conditions in her country and decided to take action. After attending a five-day retreat, she was inspired to create an educational institution to develop Christian leaders who would act as catalysts for social change. She founded the Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila School in 1990. Subsequently, the San Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila School (SLRMS) of Marikina City was founded in 2003. Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila School offers Catholic education. On January 3, 2006, the Bishop of Antipolo, the Most Rev. Gabriel V. Reyes D.D., officially recognized the School as a member of the Diocese of Antipolo Catholic School Association (DACSA).  Patron Saint  Through investigation of the records that survived the Binondo fire of World War II, historians believe Lorenzo Ruiz was born between 1600 and 1610 A.D. and was baptized in the Dominican Church, the only church in Binondo at the time. His father was Chinese and his mother was native Tagalog. According to Friar Diego Rodriguez, Lorenzo was an altar boy and sacristan at the Binondo convent during his youth. He was educated by the Dominican Fathers and was their escribano or calligrapher, because of his expert penmanship. In 1636 Lorenzo Ruiz was falsely charged with homicide. With the help of the Dominican Fathers and Domingo Gonzales, Ruiz fled the Philippines on 10 June 1636. He went as a missionary to Japan where the Christian Church was failing. During this time the Japanese ruler, Tokugawa Ieyasu, began to persecute Christians, whom he viewed as a political threat. When it was discovered that Ruiz was Catholic, he was arrested in Nagasaki with four other priests and a layman. The group was forced to renounce their faith or face death. Lorenzo Ruiz's famous last words were, \\"That I will never do, because I am a Christian and I shall die for God, and for Him I will give many thousand lives if I had them. And so do (to) me as you please\\". He was taken with his companions to the \\"Mountain of Martyrs\\" on 27 September 1637. They were sentenced to death, suffering torture by water and by needles, and were hanged above a pit. Over 350 years later, Fr. Domingo Gonzalez wrote a detailed narrative of Lorenzo Ruiz's martyrdom. Ruiz was beatified by Pope John Paul II, along with 15 other martyrs, during the Papal visit to Manila on 18 February 1981. Lorenzo Ruiz was canonized on 18 October 1987 by John Paul II. St. Lorenzo has become the Filipino symbol of unwavering faith in God.

The central government, the states, and the German municipalities have different tasks and partially competing regions of responsibilities ruled by a complex system of checks and balances.  History  German federalism dates back to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages, to the reforms that came with the Peace of Westphalia and to the constitution of the German Empire from 1871. Following German unification, German federalism came into conflict with German nationalism. Nationalists argued for power to be concentrated in the central government in Berlin, but were resisted by monarchs and their governments in the various German states outside the Kingdom of Prussia, with the Kingdom of Bavaria in particular keen to defend the rights afforded to it in the Imperial constitution. After the end of World War II, the federal nature of Germany was restored, after having been effectively abolished under the nazis. The current German constitution, adopted in 1949, protects Germany's federal nature in the so-called eternity clause. Since re-unification in 1990, the Federal Republic has consisted of sixteen states: the ten states of the Federal Republic before re-unification (\\"West Germany\\"), the five new states of the former East Germany, and Berlin.  Division of powers  Landtag (state parliament) of the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany divides authority between the federal government and the states (German: \\"L√§nder\\"), with the general principle governing relations articulated in Article 30: \\"Except as otherwise provided or permitted by this Basic Law, the exercise of state powers and the discharge of state functions is a matter for the L√§nder.\\" Thus, the federal government can exercise authority only in those areas specified in the Basic Law. The states are represented at the federal level through the Bundesrat, which has a role similar to the upper house in a true bicameral parliament. The Basic Law divides the federal and state governments' legislative responsibilities into exclusive federal powers (Articles 71 and 73), competing powers (Articles 72, 74), deviation powers (Article 72), and exclusive state powers (Article 70). The exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government includes defense, foreign affairs, immigration, citizenship, communications, and currency standards, whereas the states have exclusive jurisdiction on the police (excluding federal police), most of education, the press, freedom of assembly, public housing, corrections and media affairs, among others. Even in cases where the states have exclusive jurisdiction, they sometimes choose to work with each other and come to a basic agreement with the other states, which is then passed by the sixteen state parliaments and thereby enshrined into law nationwide. This is done in order to avoid legal patchworks. An example of this is the states' online gambling regulations. In the areas of nature conservation, university degrees, and university admission, among others, state legislation can deviate from (i.e. amend or replace) federal legislation. The federal and state governments share concurrent powers in several areas, including, but not limited to: business law, civil law, welfare, taxation, consumer protection, public holidays, and public health. In many concurrent powers, however, state legislation only remains in effect as long as there is no federal legislation that contradicts its contents, though the passage of such federal legislation may be subject to additional legal requirements, as stipulated by Article 72, Section 2 of the Basic Law. The areas of shared responsibility for the states and the federal government were enlarged by an amendment to the Basic Law in 1969 (Articles 91a and 91b), which calls for joint action in areas of broad social concern such as higher education, regional economic development, and agricultural reform. International relations, including international treaties, are primarily the responsibility of the federal level but, as in other federations, the constituent states have limited powers in this area. As provided in Article 23, Article 24, and Article 32 of the Basic Law, the states (L√§nder) have the right to representation at the federal level (i.e. through the Bundesrat) in matters of international relations that affect them, including the transfer of sovereignty to international organizations and, with the consent of the federal government, have limited powers to conclude international treaties. Some older treaties between German states and other countries also remain in effect. The Bavarian‚ÄìAustrian Salt Treaty of 1829 (), for instance, is the oldest European treaty still in effect.Alexander Wegmaier: Salinenkonvention 1829 und 1957 In: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns (24.6. 2013) 1957 the government of Bavaria used a revision of the treaty to actively claim the states' rights against the will and claims of the federal government.  States' role in federal politics   Federal legislation  The Bundestag (meaning Federal Diet) is Germany's federal parliament and the de facto lower house of the federal legislature, and the Bundesrat (Federal Council), which represents the states at the federal level, is the de facto upper house. The entirety of the Bundestag is elected in a single federal election, which is typically held every four years, unlike the Bundesrat, which is composed of the sixteen state governments and therefore prone to change in its composition frequently, as the various states hold elections at different times with little to no coordination. As a result, the federal governing coalition (which requires a majority in only the lower house, i.e. the Bundestag in order to be able to govern, like in most other parliamentary systems) rarely, if ever has a stable majority in the upper house, i.e. the Bundesrat and is therefore required to compromise with opposition parties in order to pass legislation that requires the Bundesrat's approval. The Bundestag is typically the dominant body in ordinary federal lawmaking, however the Bundesrat's explicit consent (an absolute majority of members voting in favour) is required for every approval law, i.e. bills that affect state finances or administrational duties in some way, which makes up roughly 40% of all federal legislation, otherwise the bill is effectively vetoed and this veto cannot be overridden by the Bundestag. The Bundesrat also has the ability to veto every other type of legislation, so-called objection laws, by an absolute majority and two-thirds majority of all members, though this veto can be overridden by an absolute majority of all members and a two-thirds majority of voting members representing at least of half of all members in the Bundestag, respectively. A two-thirds majority of all members in the Bundestag and a two-thirds majority of all voting members (representing at least half of members) in the Bundesrat is required for any constitutional amendment.  Federal judiciary  In a rotating fashion, Federal Constitutional Court judges are elected by a two-thirds majority vote by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. By a majority vote, judges of other federal courts (e.g. Federal Court of Justice) are elected simultaneously by both the federation and the states with each having half of the voting power.  President  The president of Germany, a largely symbolic position given Germany's parliamentary system but nonetheless the official head of state, is also elected by both the federal parliament and state legislatures coequally (see: Federal Convention (Germany)).  Composition of state representation  The makeup of the Bundesrat and therefore the representation of the states at the federal level is fundamentally different from the upper houses of some other federal systems, such as the Swiss Council of States or the United States Senate. In those countries, upper house legislators are elected separately and are therefore independent from their respective state governments. In contrast, the members of the Bundesrat are merely delegates of state governments and invariably vote and propose laws as instructed by their respective governments, meaning the states exert direct influence over federal politics.  European Union  Since Germany is a member of the European Union, some of the powers the federal government constitutionally possesses are, in practice, exercised by EU institutions, namely by the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, and the European Court of Justice. The EU policy areas, shared or exclusive, include, but are not limited to: monetary policy (Germany being a member of the Eurozone), environment, agriculture, foreign policy, internal market, customs union, and consumer protection. However, all of these powers were freely delegated to the EU by Germany (unlike in a federation where power is inherent and does not require delegation) and Germany remains sovereign and maintains the right to leave the union, therefore, the EU is not part of German federalism. Germany also maintains a large degree of control over EU policy through the European Council and its MEPs in the European Parliament.

The story takes place in the small, fictional town of Whilomville, New York. An African- American coachman named Henry Johnson, who is employed by the town's physician, Dr. Trescott, becomes horribly disfigured after he saves Trescott's son from a fire. When Henry is branded a \\"monster\\" by the town's residents, Trescott vows to shelter and care for him, resulting in his family's exclusion from the community. The novella reflects upon the 19th-century social divide and ethnic tensions in America. The fictional town of Whilomville, which is used in 14 other Crane stories, was based on Port Jervis, New York, where Crane lived with his family for a few years during his youth. It is thought that he took inspiration from several local men who were similarly disfigured, although modern critics have made numerous connections between the story and the 1892 lynching in Port Jervis of an African-American man named Robert Lewis. A study of prejudice, fear, and isolation in a rather small town, the novella was first published in Harper's Magazine in August 1898. A year later, it was included in The Monster and Other Stories‚Äîthe last collection of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime. Written in a more exact and less dramatic style than two of his previous major works (Maggie: A Girl of the Streets and The Red Badge of Courage), The Monster differs from the other Whilomville stories in its scope and length. Its themes include the paradoxical study of monstrosity and deformity, as well as race and tolerance. While the novella and collection received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, The Monster is now considered one of Crane's best works. Background and writing Crane began writing The Monster in June 1897 while living in Oxted, England with his longtime partner Cora Taylor.Wertheim (1994), p. 266 Despite his previous success‚ÄîThe Red Badge of Courage had gone through 14 printings in the United States and six in England‚ÄîCrane was running out of money. To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. He later remarked that he wrote The Monster \\"under the spur of great need\\", as he desperately required funds.Goldsby (2006), p. 6 In August of that year, Crane and Cora were injured in a carriage accident while visiting friend Harold Frederic and his mistress Kate Lyon in Homefield, Kenley; after a week of recuperation, they followed the couple on vacation to Ireland, where Crane finished the story.Wertheim (1994), p. 271 Illustration of Henry Johnson carrying Jimmie through the burning house, by Peter Newell The Monster was Crane's first story to feature the fictional town of Whilomville; it would eventually serve as the setting of 14 stories, 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology Whilomville Stories.Nagel (Fall 1999), p. 36 The town was based on Port Jervis, New York, where the author lived from the age of six to eleven.Wertheim (1997), p. 369 Although Crane and his mother relocated to Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1880, until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident William Howe Crane.Goldsbury (2006), p. 116 Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing The Monster, he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville.Schaefer (1996), p. 236 While Crane biographer Thomas Beer claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis teamster named Levi Hume,Wertheim (1997), p. 225 Crane's niece, Edna Crane Sidbury, believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer.Naito (2006), p. 36 In Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor, author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as Zip the Pinhead, whose real name was William Henry Johnson, and Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man.Young (2008), p. 81 It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People; although first published in 1882, the play‚Äîabout a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community‚Äîfirst became popular in the United States in the mid-1890s.Nagel (Spring 1999), p. 50 Modern critics have connected the novella's themes of racial division to a violent episode in Port Jervis' history. On June 2, 1892, an African-American man named Robert Lewis was lynched for allegedly assaulting a local white woman.Goldsby (2006), p. 105 On his way to the Port Jervis jail, Lewis was set upon by a mob of several hundred white men who dragged him through the town, beat him and hanged him from a tree. William Howe Crane lived within sight of where the lynching took place and was one of the few men, together with the chief of police, who attempted to intervene.Naito (2006), p. 37 Although Stephen Crane was not present, there were detailed accounts published in both the Port Jervis Gazette and the New-York Tribune, and Crane contributed to the Tribune at the time. The Gazette marked the day of Lewis' lynching as \\"one of the most disgraceful scenes that was ever enacted in Port Jervis\\", and activist Ida B. Wells launched a campaign to investigate the murder as well as the widespread theory that Lewis was set up.Goldsby (2006), pp. 107‚Äì108 Of the 1,134 reported lynchings throughout the United States between 1882 and 1899, Lewis was the only black man to be lynched in New York.Wertheim (1997), p. 195Goldsby (2006), p. 111 Crane initially sent his manuscript of more than 21,000 words to McClure's, along with several other works including \\"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\\", but it remained unpublished for nearly a year.Wertheim (1994), p. 277 After McClure's eventual rejection, The Monster appeared in the August 1898 issue of Harper's Magazine with illustrations by Peter Newell.Wertheim (1994), p. 333 A year later, it was published in the United States by Harper & Brothers Publishers in a collection titled The Monster and Other Stories, which included two other works by Crane, \\"The Blue Hotel\\" and \\"His New Mittens\\". The first British edition, which added an additional four stories, was published in 1901.Wertheim (1997), p. 228 Plot summary After being admonished by his father, Dr. Ned Trescott, for damaging a peony while playing in his family's yard, young Jimmie Trescott visits his family's coachman, Henry Johnson. Henry, who is described as \\"a very handsome negro\\", \\"known to be a light, a weight, and an eminence in the suburb of the town\\",Crane (1899), p. 6 is friendly toward Jimmie. Later that evening Henry dresses smartly and saunters through town‚Äîinciting catcalls from friends and ridicule from the local white men‚Äîon his way to call on the young Bella Farragut, who is extremely taken with him. That same evening, a large crowd gathers in the park to hear a band play. Suddenly, the nearby factory whistle blows to alert the townspeople of a fire in the second district of the town; men gather hose- carts and head toward the blaze that is quickly spreading throughout Dr. Trescott's house. Mrs. Trescott is saved by a neighbor, but cannot locate Jimmie, who is trapped inside. Henry appears from the crowd and rushes into the house in search of the boy, finding him unharmed in his bedroom. Unable to retreat the way he came, Henry carries Jimmie, wrapped in a blanket, to the doctor's laboratory and the hidden stairway that leads outside. He discovers the fire has blocked this way out as well and collapses beside Dr. Trescott's desk. A row of nearby jars shatters from the heat, spilling molten chemicals upon Henry's upturned face. Dr. Trescott returns home to find his house ablaze; after he is told by his hysterical wife that Jimmie is still inside, he rushes into the house by way of the laboratory's hidden passageway. He finds Jimmie still wrapped in the blanket and carries him outside. Hearing that Henry is inside the house, Dr. Trescott attempts to re-enter, but is held back. Another man goes into the house and returns with the badly burned \\"thing\\" that used to be Henry Johnson. The injured men and boy are taken to Judge Denning Hagenthorpe's house across the street to be treated, but while it is thought that Dr. Trescott and Jimmie will survive their injuries, Henry is pronounced as good as dead; he is mourned as a hero by the town. Henry Johnson survives, however, under the watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of gratitude for saving his son's life. Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he \\"will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue.\\"Crane (1899), p. 44 Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors. Style The story is told from the point of view of a selectively omniscient narrator who seemingly chooses whether or not to divulge plot points as they occur, causing \\"a pattern of expectation\\" on the part of the reader.Giles (1992), p. 52 Although the novella is separated into 24 chapters, some critics‚Äîamong them Charles B. Ives, Thomas Gullason and Marston LeFrance‚Äîbelieve these chapters are further divided into two parts: chapters 1‚Äì9 lead up to Henry's injury, whereas chapters 10‚Äì24 map the town's response.Schaefer (1996), p. 258 Critic David Halliburton wrote in his 1989 book The Color of the Sky: A Study of Stephen Crane that The Monster displayed a more \\"chastened\\" and exact style than Crane's earlier works, which were often a mixture of clever bawdiness and epic dramatics‚Äîboth of which are seen respectively in Maggie: A Girl of the Streets and The Red Badge of Courage.Halliburton (1989), pp. 2‚Äì3 Edwin H. Cady believed The Monster is the best indication of the writer Crane may have become had he lived longer, showcasing a style that is \\"technically proficient, controlled, and broadly insightful.\\"Schaefer (1996), p. 256 The Monster relies heavily on Crane's signature use of imagery and symbolism.Wolford (1989), p. 49 Frequent images and metaphors dealing with sight appear several times in the story, especially in regard to the townspeople's lack of vision, both literally and morally. The townspeople are similarly depicted using imagery of either animals or machines, characterizing them as both bestial and mindless.Schaefer (1996), p. 260 Color imagery is also prevalent. For example, fire‚Äîboth literal and symbolic‚Äîfeatures prominently throughout the story.Schaefer (1996), p. 241 While critics as early as Edward Garnett in 1921 pointed to Crane's heavy use of irony in The Monster, other critics such as Michael D. Warner question whether Crane intended the story to be read as ironic, or if this is the result of the author's \\"oddly contradictory attitude toward his characters.\\"Warner (1985), p. 76 In his introduction to 1921's Men, Women and Boats, one of the first Crane anthologies, Vincent Starrett noted the difference in tone between The Monster and the 14 other tales that Crane set in the fictional Whilomville. He wrote, \\"The realism is painful; one blushes for mankind. But while this story really belongs in the volume called Whilomville Stories, it is properly left out of that series. The Whilomville stories are pure comedy, and The Monster is a hideous tragedy.\\"Weatherford (1997), p. 313 Critic William M. Morgan noted the stories' similar fascination with \\"pure animal spirits\\" and \\"meanings of boyhood\\", but differentiated The Monster focus on \\"a larger, more mature, and modernizing community.\\"Morgan (2004), p. 72 Paul Sorrentino also pointed to the style differences, noting the story's focus on the adult characters rather than the children, as well as the overall length of the story; at more than 21,000 words, it dwarfs the other Whilomville tales.Sorrentino (2006), p. 138 However, there is disagreement among critics as to whether The Monster should be considered a short story or a novella. Crane called it a \\"novelette\\", and the Library of America edition refers to it as a novella.Young (2008), p. 258 Themes Stephen Crane in 1894; print of a portrait by artist and friend Corwin K. Linson The question of morality plays a large role in The Monster, especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, \\"What is at stake in The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality. If Trescott's actions are supererogative and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged.\\"Dooley (1993), p. 97 Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits \\"prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill.\\" Various critics have written about the story's paradoxical themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society.Mitchell (1990), p. 180 The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when it becomes clear that the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, \\"Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster, \\"Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis-figure him?\\"Mitchell (1990), p. 175 Similarly, Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the \\"invasion myth\\", made worse by the fact that the \\"monster\\" is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore \\"generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama.\\"Bloom (2004), p. 330 Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small-town mentality.Bloom (2004), p. 331 Race is a polarizing theme throughout the story. As William M. Morgan wrote, while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless, and the black characters as warm and amusing, the town's racial hierarchy is omnipresent.Morgan (2004), p. 82 Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story, as critic Nan Goodman noted; as a post-Civil War work, The Monster revisits slavery's legacy, as well as its effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson. At the beginning of the story, it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he \\"behaves himself\\" and \\"knows his place\\" as a black man.Wolford (1989), p. 47 Later, when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie, it is said that \\"he was submitting, submitting because of his fathers, bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration.\\"Goodman (2000), p. 120 However, while his suffering is central to the story, Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character; before the fire, he \\"strikes in quick succession the minstrel's poses of an old-time, happy-go-lucky Negro\\", who charms children and women alike. Despite his heroism, Morgan stated, Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype.Morgan (2004), p. 83 Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane's lack of racial sensitivity while writing The Monster, although they note that the author was simply exhibiting \\"unconscious racism\\" in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century.Schaefer (1996), p. 252 In his 2002 essay, \\"Blunders of Virtue: The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster, John Clemen sums up the critics' tendency to either \\"ignore the evidence of Crane's racism, to dismiss it as a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes, or to reconfigure it within his irony in such a way as to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight.\\"Clemen (2002), p. 121 Reception and legacy The Monster is sometimes compared to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818). The Monster received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary critics. Before its publication, Crane's friend Joseph Conrad wrote while responding to a partial draft: \\"the damned story has been haunting me ... I think it must be fine.\\"Schaefer (1996), p. 243 William Dean Howells, an early champion of Crane, proclaimed the novella to be \\"the greatest short story ever written by an American\\".Monteiro (2000), p. 6 The Spectator concluded that The Monster alone would have cemented Crane's literary reputation; its reviewer wrote, \\"If Mr. Crane had never written anything else, he would have earned the right of remembrance by this story alone.\\"Monteiro (2009), p. xix The reviewer for The Critic dismissed it as \\"an unpleasant story ... There is humor in the telling, but it is humor of a rather grim character.\\"Wertheim (1994), p. 423 Julian Hawthorne, son of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, also ultimately disliked the novella, calling it \\"an outrage on art and humanity\\".Wertheim (1994), p. 422 He did, however, point to the similarities between Crane's \\"monster\\" and Victor Frankenstein's creation in Mary Shelley's most famous work, stating that Crane, like Shelley before him, successfully depicted an innocent outsider being tormented by townspeople who are themselves made monstrous by their irrational fears.Weatherford (1997), p. 22 Other critics have since echoed the comparison between Shelley's character and Henry Johnson; Elizabeth Young explained the parallels in that, similar to Frankenstein narrative‚Äîin which \\"a male body is hideously transformed in a scientist's laboratory and brought back by the scientist from the dead‚ÄîJohnson's disfigurement takes place in a doctor's laboratory, and it is Trescott that ultimately saves him.Young (2008), p. 84 The Monster and Other Stories was the last collection of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime. In the mid-20th century, the novella received a resurgence of critical attention, especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th-century New York. Critic Chester L. Wolford wrote that the story \\"reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years. The story is, indeed, an excoriation of social conditions for the blacks, but more important ... it is an excoriation of all communities, all societies, in all places and all times.\\"Wolford (1989), p. 48 African-American author Ralph Ellison called The Monster, alongside Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, \\"one of the parents of the modern American novel\\".Schweik (2008), p. 218 In a 1999 article, critic James Nagel stated that \\"no other work of short fiction in the decade was more important thematically, and nothing until William Faulkner's \\"The Bear\\" so enriched the genre of the United States.Nagel (Spring 1999), p. 48 Screenwriter and director Albert Band adapted Crane's novella for the 1959 film Face of Fire, starring Cameron Mitchell as Dr. Trescott and James Whitmore as Johnson. Unlike in the original story, Johnson was depicted as white, and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk.Weaver (2010), p. 223 Notes References *Bloom, Harold. 2004. American Naturalism.

It was ported to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. Coleman also wrote Rainbow Walker for Synapse, published the same year. In Pharaoh's Curse the player attempts to collect 16 treasures from an Egyptian tomb while avoiding the pharaoh, his mummy, and various traps. John Szczepaniak, writing for GamesTM magazine, called The Pharaoh's Curse an early example of what later became known as the Metroidvania genre.  Gameplay The hero waits at the top of the screen for a trap to return into the ground before retrieving the treasure to the right. The Pharaoh is at the bottom, the Winged Avenger to the right of the treasure. The Pharaoh's Curse world is arranged as a series of 16 rooms in a 4 by 4 layout, using the flip screen technique of moving between them. The game opens with the player on a title screen, and they start the game by running onto the entrance, a pit, and falling into the tombs below. The rooms consist of various levels in a cave-like layout. The player can drop any distance without harm, and can climb back up on the ropes or elevator-like moving platforms that appear on most screens. Each of the rooms contains one of 16 treasures, which provided an extra life when they are retrieved. A display along the top of the screen indicates which treasures still had to be collected. While playing, two opponents appear regularly, the pharaoh and the mummy, which then chase the player. The player can shoot them, and they both shoot back at a much slower rate. Traps in the map, triggered by walking over visible triggers, tend to be more dangerous. Some triggers are positioned on the tops of elevators or the bottom of drops, making fast action required. Some of the rooms are sealed from each other using magic gates. These can be opened with keys that appear randomly around the map. Lastly, there is a flying creature, the Winged Avenger, which picks the player on contact, carries him through the screens and drops him somewhere. The Avenger can carry the player to areas that are otherwise unavailable due to the layout or a lack of keys. Once all treasures have been collected, the player must escape back to the starting screen. Subsequently, they receive a level password and the game restarts in a higher of the four difficulty levels. Reception Antic gave the game a favorable review, saying \\"Pharaoh's Curse will appeal to all computerists and gamesters... It's another winner from Synapse.\\" HI-Res said \\"This Tutankham takeoff is marvelous and the Joystick capability is magnificent.\\" Personal Computer Games gave the VIC-20 version an 8 out of 10 rating, saying \\"The basic idea behind Pharaoh's Curse isn't particularly new, but there are enough original touches to give a unique feel to the game. The program is visually attractive, easy to grasp, and great fun to play.\\" They later awarded it the title of VIC-20 game of the year. In 2014, Josh Despain writing for Defunct Games gave it a B grade, saying it held a special place in his heart and that \\"I remember an ever-present desire to play this game whenever I had the chance.\\" References  External links  *The Pharaoh's Curse at Atari Mania * Category:1983 video games Category:Platform games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Commodore VIC-20 games Category:Synapse Software games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"The Pharaoh's Curse (video game)"},{"id":"26187485","text":"Arthur Carew Richards (20 February 1865 - 29 November 1930) was an English first-class cricketer and British Army officer. Richards was a right-handed batsman who was a right-arm slow bowler. Cricket Richards made his first- class debut for Hampshire in 1884 against Sussex. Richards made two appearances for Hampshire in the 1884 season, the second of which was against Somerset in what was to be Hampshire's final season with first-class status until the 1895 County Championship. Nine years after Hampshire had regained their first-class status and nineteen years after last representing the county, Richards played a single first-class match in 1903 against Essex. Richards final first-class appearance for Hampshire came in 1904 against Sussex. In his four first-class matches for Hampshire, Richards scored 104 runs at a batting average of 17.33, with a high score of 47.

The AMA was introduced during the postwar United States-led- and-controlled Allied occupation. President Harry S. Truman, on 6 September 1945, issued a presidential directive instructing the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) to dissolve Zaibatsu structures. Prior to World War II, Japan had no antitrust laws. There were seventeen Zaibatsu organisations, the four largest of which had controlled approximately a fourth of all of the paid-up capital in the Japanese economy just prior to the World War. In opposition to General MacArthur's fear that Zaibatsu dissolution would lead to instability, the U.S. Departments of State and Justice sent a \\"Special Mission on Japanese Combines\\" to Japan for the implementation of a comprehensive antimonopoly framework. In response, MacArthur coerced the Japanese Diet into adopting legislation known as the Antimonopoly Act (AMA), with the persuasion to them that enforcement was optional. Antimonopoly Act MacArthur's AMA, which is still Japan's fundamental competition law, generalised prohibitions against three types of anticompetitive conduct. *private monopolization *unreasonable restraints of trade and *unfair methods of competition. The AMA led to the formation of Japan's Fair Trade Commission (JFTC). Relaxation of the Act The weakness of the AMA was due to vagueness requiring JFTC officials to be familiar with presumptions built into American antitrust laws. Seeing the need for stability and the growing threat of Communism, the United States backtracked on requiring Japan's enforcement of the AMA and instead encouraged the resurrection of Zaibatsu structures. Japan, which had grown increasingly independent of the United States in the 1950s, succumbed to pressures from Japanese business and need for recovery from economic depression due to the end of the Korean War. The SCAP and the U.S. Government acquiesced to Prime Minister Yoshida's actions to enact relaxations to the AMA when occupation of Japan ended with the implementation of the San Francisco Peace Treaty on 28 April 1952. All cartels illegal under the original AMA were effectively legalized. Strengthening of the Act Amendments were made to strengthen the AMA in the 1970s due to, in part, pressures from American businesses. The 1973 oil crisis and price fixing by Japanese oil companies further garnered public opinion in Japan against the weakness of the AMA and its lack of enforcement. The new articles introduced authorised the JFTC to dissolve or divest a company based on barriers against market-entry, lack of price benefit for consumers and unreasonable profits. The JFTC was authorised to impose fines for violations of the AMA. Cartels still exist However, the existence of cartels known as keiretsu are still legalized with the following notes. *Cartels calculate penalties beforehand and include such penalties as costs of business. *Penalty calculations, which do not correlate with profits, present insufficient financial disincentives for businesses to collude. *Courts in Japan lack contempt powers to ensure compliance with the JFTC's cease and desist orders.

However, the residents of Cleveland sought to be independent of the division and on 29 May 1885, Cleveland Division was separated from Tingalpa Division. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, the Tingalpa Division became the Shire of Tingalpa on 31 March 1903.

History The two principals, Peter Chermayeff and Bobby C. Poole, have collaborated on the design of public aquariums since 1975. Their long collaboration, with focus on the design of public aquariums, began in 1975 when Bobby Poole joined Cambridge Seven Associates, where Peter Chermayeff was a founding principal together with Paul Dietrich, Terry Rankine, Louis Bakanowsky, Alden Christie, Ivan Chermayeff, and Tom Geismar. The first project for the seven founding principals was the New England Aquarium, of which Peter Chermayeff was the principal in charge. It opened in 1969. The man himself put each fish in the giant tank which is made up of 200 thousand gallon of water. Including the sand tiger shark in the tank. The first thirty six years of design work at Cambridge Seven Associates, in much of which Peter Chermayeff played a leading role, included the modernization of the Boston Transportation system, the MBTA, now known as the T, the United States Pavilion and Exhibition at Expo '67, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, the San Antonio Museum of Art, Charles Square, a hotel, retail, housing and office complex in Cambridge, Massachusetts, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Boston?‚Äù, a mixed media celebration and portrait of Boston for the United States Bicentennial, the Osaka Aquarium, the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, and the Aquarium of Genoa. These and other projects led to C7A receiving the Architecture Firm of the Year award in 1993 from the AIA. Bobby Poole joined C7A in 1976 to work with Peter Chermayeff on the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Poole became the Aquarium‚Äôs Project Architect. He led the preparation of final design documents, the on-site overview of construction and installation, and became a principal in 1986. He further developed his interest in aquariums working with Peter Chermayeff on the Osaka Aquarium, the Tennessee Aquarium, the Aquarium of Genoa, the Lisbon Oceanarium, and the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska. They also collaborated on unbuilt aquariums and rainforest pavilions proposed by Chermayeff while at C7A for Moscow, Russia, for Hamburg, Bremerhaven and Oberhausen in Germany, and for Tsuruhama, Osaka, in Japan. Peter Chermayeff and Bobby Poole continued their close collaboration until 2005 with Peter Sollogub under the firm name Chermayeff, Sollogub and Poole, Inc., until 2009 under the firm name Chermayeff & Poole, Inc., and since that year as Peter Chermayeff LLC. Recent completed projects have included the expansion of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, and the expansion of the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, both of which opened in 2005. Expansion of the Museo Nivola in Orani, Sardinia, a second component of a museum dedicated to the sculptor Costantino Nivola, was completed in 2005. The remodeling and expansion of the Virginia Aquarium at Virginia Beach, Virginia, was completed in 2009. Recent unbuilt projects have included a proposed Aquarium and Environmental Center for Alexandria, Egypt, the New Songdo Ecotarium in Incheon, near Seoul, South Korea, and the proposed remodeling and expansion of Nausica√§ Centre National de la Mer in Boulogne Sur Mer, France.

The ‚Äú3rd antimonopoly package‚Äù, which entered into force in January 2012, is indicative of a general trend of liberalization of antimonopoly regulation. Indeed, its stated aim was to bring Russia more in line with European competition regulations. History Russian competition law was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in March 1991. In the final stages of glasnost and the deteriorating tethering of the USSR, the various member soviet republics saw the need for regulation and stabilisation of trade. The representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ratified the Law on Competition and Limitation of Monopolistic Activity in Goods Market in March 1991 which became anti-monopoly policies within Russia after secession from the USSR. The Law on the Protection of Competition of 2006 is legislation pursued to translate those policies back into law. Federal Law No. 135-FZ Federal Law No. 135-FZ, ‚ÄúOn the Protection of Competition\\", was legislated on July 26, 2006, and entered into force on October 26, 2006. Federal Antimonopoly Service  The law was \\"initiated and developed\\" by the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) (), the federal-level executive governmental organ that controls the execution of antitrust and competition. Headed by Igor Artemyev, it had been established by the Decree of President of Russia ‚Ññ314 on March 9, 2004.Federal Antimonopoly Service website (English) The law also gives the FAS authority over approval of company mergers stipulating various combinations of thresholds of assets of merging companies, an excess of which would require prior approval from the FAS. The scope of regulation of the FAS is focused on the commodity market and financial services with mandates over operations and transactions not just within the Russian Federation but also those taking place outside the boundaries of Russia which would have anti-competitive effects on the Russian market place. As with the trend in the United States and the European Union, the FAS has also taken Microsoft to task for anti-competitive behaviour by bringing Microsoft to court on 4 June 2009. Dominance Beyond western European competition laws against dominance, the Competition Law in Russia expressly presumes the existence of dominance by defining thresholds. * A company is \\"presumed dominant\\" if it has more than 50% of market share * Dominance must be established by FAS if a company has more than 35% of market share * A company with less than 35% of market share is generally not considered dominant unless FAS establishes a case for dominance based on factors like analyses of competition on the market and stability of market share * Collective dominance exists if the market share of each entity exceeds 8% and the aggregate market share: **Exceeds 50% for not more than 3 entities **Exceeds 75% for not more than 5 entities * A safe harbour margin of up to 20% market share per company for agreements between companies of different segments of a supply chain Other provisions The law also places restrictions on aids from, and public procurement policies of, federal, provincial, or municipal governments that otherwise would encourage anti- competition. In addition to a distinct competition law, the Code of Administrative Offences has also been amended to increase liability of anti- competitive practices. Punitive measures against anti-competitive practices are meted out in terms of percentages of revenues of a company. Company directors can be criminally liable in cases of a repeated abuse‚Äîe.g., establishing high monopoly or low monopoly prices, unjustified evasion from the execution of contracts with individual customers, creation of obstacles for other entities entering the market‚Äîand can be sentenced to up to 7 years in prison.

Childhood and marriage Adam Sherrill was one of the six children of William \\"The Fur Trader\\" Sherrill . His wife's name remains unknown despite much searching on the part of many genealogists. However, it is certain that it was NOT Margarette Rudisil. In 1722 Sherrill married \\"Elizabeth\\". Her surname is unknown, and to date, there is no evidence that it was either Corzine or Preston-Davidson. Soon after their marriage they lived in West Donegal Township, Chester Co. PA, then southern Lancaster County, PA until about 1735. Adam then followed his father and brother to western MD until about 1740-41, after which he moved to the southern end of newly-formed Frederick County, VA Augusta County, Virginia. After finding out that is land was not in Augusta County when the line was surveyed in 1746, Adam left VA in 1747, and migrated to North Carolina where he became the first European to settle on the west side of the Catawba River. Children Adam and Elizabeth had nine children, eight sons and one daughter. The children were: William B.; Samuel; Uriah; Adam Jr.; Aquilla; Isaac; Jacob; Moses; and Catherine. Fording the Catawba River In 1747, Adam and his family moved from Augusta Co., Virginia and became the first Europeans to permanently settle on the west side of Catawba River in North Carolina. Adam spent two days scouting the Catawba River when he crossed it at a shallow area thereafter called Sherrill's Ford (located just north of modern-day Charlotte, NC). Adam's later received a land patent in 1749 on acreage located on the west bank of the Catawba River. Adam had an advantage that other early settlers didn't, which was that he spent several years of his childhood living with the native Susquehanna Tribe near Conestoga, PA. The Susquehanna spoke an Iroquoian dialect, and Adam became fluent in the language. Later in life, the area Adam settled in west of the Catawba River was populated by the Cherokee and Catawba tribes, who also spoke an Iroquoian dialect. Certainly, understanding the customs and language of the native inhabitants was a huge advantage to Adam. In fact, Adam apparently negotiated a lease with the Cherokee that allowed him to stay while other settlers were harassed or even killed. For perspective, it was over two decades after Adam settled at Sherrill's Ford that a town called \\"Charlottesburg\\" was founded about 10 miles to the south. This settlement later grew into the modern metropolis that is Charlotte, NC. Will Adam Sherrill wrote his will on March 5, 1772. It states: In the name of God, Amen, I, ADAM SHERRILL of the County of Rowan and the province of North Carolina being in perfect health and memory, praised be God, do make this my last will and testament as followeth: I give and bequeath unto my son ADAM, one Negro fellow, called and known by the name of Vail to him and his heirs forever after my decease. I give and bequeath unto my son QUILLAR one Negro after my decease if either one, besides Vail, and in case I should have no others after my decease. I give unto my son QUILLAR thirty pounds in lieu therefore to be raised out of my estate after my decease to him and his heirs. I give and bequeath unto my son WILLIAM SHERRILL one of the best horses or mares that I posses at my decease to him and his heirs forever. The true intent and meaning of this, my last will is that no other will make by me or any other in my name shall disannul this my last will. I do appoint my two sons, ADAM and QUILLAR executors of this my last will and Testament. 5 March 1772 Adam Sherrill'' The witnesses of this will are: James Clark, Jr.; Abraham Roberson, Jr.; and William Berry. Death Adam died May 4, 1774, of old age. He was 76 or 77. He left his wife and nine children. His sons Samuel and William later fought in the Revolutionary War at The Battle of King's Mountain, along with several of their sons.

On 24 August 1998, during its descent to Tachileik the flight went missing over a hill approximately two miles (3.2 km) from the airport. Search and rescue team later found the wreckage of the aircraft. The accident killed all 36 passengers and crew.Aircraft accident Fokker F-27 Friendship 600 XY-AEN Tachilek Flight Flight UB635 took off at around 08:30 UTC, flying from Myanmar's former capital Yangon to Tachileik, a town located near the Myanmar- Thailand border in eastern Myanmar with 36 passengers and crew members. The passengers were mostly members from the Myanmar military. It was a two hour flight and it was scheduled to land in Tachilek Airport at 02:00 UTC. The flight however missed its schedule and was declared missing by authorities. Search and rescue operation Myanmar officials contacted Thai authorities to assist with the search operation of the flight. Thailand's aide to the army chief Col. Nipat Thonglek stated that the crew members had at least twice contacted the airport for poor visibility during their descent to the airport. The flight might have been diverted to nearby Heho Airport in Myanmar or Chiang Mai Airport in Thailand, but officials from both airports claimed that neither of them had heard or seen any signs from the aircraft. Workers from Bangkok International Airport also stated that there were no signs that the aircraft had entered Thai airspace and no emergency calls were received by the operators. On 25 August, a Myanmar official stated that Flight 635 had landed safely at an old airfield in Laos. He added that the passengers and crews were \\"OK\\" and that the aircraft was able to be flown back to Yangon by the next day. However, on 27 August, Laos Foreign Ministry denied the reports made by Myanmar officials two days earlier that the plane had landed safely in northern Laos. Myanmar's Foreign Ministry stated that the search was resumed. Later that day, Myanmar officials announced that they had been informed by the Laotian government that the aircraft had crashed in northern Laos, with no details provided on the fate of the passengers and crews. On 28 August, Myanmar officials retracted their statement that the aircraft had crashed in northern Laos, stating that the aircraft had crashed in Myanmar's territory. The wreckage was found by search party at 02:00 a.m local time, in a mountainous and densely forested area. Government officials announced that all 36 bodies had been found. Everyone on board, including 4 crew members and 3 babies, were killed in the crash. Controversy A news report from Bangkok Post stated that several people had actually survived the crash, but were eventually killed by local villagers. It was reported that five people had survived the crash and were eventually tortured, gang-raped and murdered by the villagers. The paper quoted unnamed officials and witnesses from the crash site, stating that an air stewardess and a female university student were gang-raped, while the male survivors, who were military personnel, were tortured and punched by the ethnic Shan villagers. The infant was reportedly starved to death. Myanmar authorities stated that at least 14 Shan villagers had been questioned for the incident. Passengers and crews Government officials initially stated that there were 39 passengers and crew members on board the flight. It was later revised to 36 passengers and crew members, including 3 infants. Most of those on board were members from the Myanmar military and their family members. Myanmar authorities stated that all on board were from Myanmar. Among the passengers were Tachileik police chief and senior officials from Tachileik.

He has performed and written for acts such as Cascada, Alexandra Stan and Laurent Wolf. He is best known for his song \\"Fiesta\\" as well as his appearance in Cascada's 2009 hit single \\"Evacuate the Dancefloor\\". The title sold over three million copies worldwide and reached the top 20 on Billboard charts, making Carlprit the first person of Zimbabwean origin to have a song on the top U.S. Billboard charts. Early life Carlprit was born in Avenues, Harare, to a Zimbabwean mother and German father. He grew up at 20 Tom Ward Ave., Cotswold Hills, Mabelreign, Harare. He attended North Park Primary School and Ellis Robins Boys' High School before leaving Harare to live with one of his older brothers in Germany. The youngest of five siblings, Carlprit is the younger brother of rapper Metaphysics of S√∂hne Mannheims.  Music career  Carlprit first started releasing records in early 2000 after moving to Germany. In 2003, he appeared on his brother's record [The Universe], from the album Digital Garden. After that, he released numerous unofficial mix tape remixes throughout his neighborhood, but was unable to receive any real recognition due to the language barrier that he faced in Germany. Drawing on his older brother's dealings with multi-platinum German band [S√∂hne Mannheim's], Carlprit tried to set up his own Hustlers Academy imprint in 2006 with entrepreneur and friend, Dahoud Faron. The label soon broke apart due to creative differences. Without a label and unable to get signed, Carlprit performed club hosting appearances and created YouTube releases as a way of gaining recognition. It was during this time that he met [Tarantado], an up-and-coming rapper from Wuppertal, DedeBeat|DEDE, who later produced and recorded most of Carlprit's first solo mix tape,[Hustlers Academy].  International success with Cascada  In 2009 Carlprit went under the management of his older brother Metaphysics, from the band [S√∂hne Mannheim's]. Carlprit was then presented to ZooLand Records. Zooland producer Yann Peifer recognized his potential and offered to try him out on a new project they were working on. Three weeks later, \\"Evacuate the Dance floor\\" was produced with Carlprit featuring in the music video, which was filmed in [Los Angeles]. The song was then released in June 2009, where it topped charts internationally the song went platinum in the U.S., and reached number one in the UK and the Netherlands.Recording Industry Association of America. RIAA. Retrieved on 2011-10-15.  After Evacuate, Collaborations & Solo work  Even with the success of Evacuate the dance floor, Carlprit still found himself under no record deal and with the hype of the mega smash hit slowly diminishing he decided to take matters into his own hands and begin collaborating with any one willing to receive rap vocals him. Carlprit has worked with top acts including Mike Candys (djmag's 67th best DJ in the world in 2013), Michael Mind Project, Alexandra Stan, Laurent Wolf, Darius & Finlay, Shaun Baker, R.I.O, U-Jean, Ian Carey, Victoria Kern, the Bodybangers, Modana, DJ Sasha Dith, DJ Manian, Whigfield, Tony T, Yanou, Italobrothers the band Irresistible and even written rap vocals for the likes of Italian media person Raffaella Fico just to mention a few.

In 2011, Zooland and Universal records released Carlprit's second solo single, \\"1234\\". The video was directed by Dany Wild and featured Miss Victoria Kern as the female acting vocalist. The single did not do very well and Carlprit soon parted ways with Zooland and Universal records.  \\"Fiesta\\" Smash Hit and SOLO Success  His third solo single, \\"Fiesta,\\" was widely considered his most successful, reaching number one in the French air play charts, the top 100 in Germany, France and Switzerland's single sales charts and over 5 million YouTube views. Fiesta was produced by The Michael Mind Project and Markus Shultz and features vocals recorded and written by CVB. The single was first signed to E.M.I but was later dropped at the turn of Universal Music's purchase of E.M.I due to the past failure of Carlprit's 1234 single which Universal had released. The single was signed mainly to Kontor records (Germany) , Scorpio Music France) and Blanco y Negro Records for (Spain). It has an exclusive version for NRG radio and was one of Frances most played singles of 2013. The video was directed by Russian Dj star Sasha With who has always played a very supportive role in Carlprit's earlier career. After the success of Fiesta, Carlprit signed with Sony music and dropped his next solo single's, \\"Here We Go\\" in early 2013 and \\"Party Round the World\\", which was to be released on 8 November 2013.

Kanu was appointed a Senior Advocate of Nigeria on 15 September 1997. In the April 1999 elections, Kanu ran for governor of Cross River State, but was defeated by Donald Duke. He was said to be a candidate for the same position in the 2003 elections. Minister of Justice In March 2002, Kanu wrote in a letter to Nigerian state governors that the application of strict Islamic or Sharia law was unconstitutional, since some judgments passed under Sharia discriminated against Muslims. That month, Amina Lawal, a young Nigerian woman accused of giving birth to a child out of wedlock was sentenced to death by stoning, a punishment that was confirmed in August 2002 by a Shari'ah court of appeals in Funtua, Katsina State. Kanu came under pressure from Amnesty International to abolish the death penalty in Nigeria. In May 2003, the Attorney General urged a Federal High Court in Abuja to order the arrest of the National Assembly leadership, and to imprison them for contempt of the court. He appealed to the court to set aside the anti-graft bill which the National Assembly had passed into law despite a presidential veto. Later career In June 2007, Kanu represented the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in a suit filed by General Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidential candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), seeking to jail the INEC Chairman Professor Maurice Iwu for refusing to allow Buhari's lawyers access to electoral materials. In May 2009, Kanu was counsel for the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Power, Nicholas Ugbane, who had been charged by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of complicity in defrauding the government of about N5.2 billion earmarked for rural electrification.

The film is based on the 1946 novel Spoonhandle written by Ruth MooreThe American Film Institute Catalog, Volume 1, Part 1, (1971). p.577 and was nominated for a 1949 Oscar for Best Special Effects (specifically, for the storm at sea sequence), but lost to Portrait of Jennie. The film was released in the UK in 1949, a year after its American theatrical release. Plot Because he has given up his study of architecture to become a fisherman, State of Maine social worker Ann Freeman breaks her engagement to Hod Stillwell, explaining that she could never bear being constantly concerned about his safety. In this same period, she convinces her friend Mary McKay to take in 11-year-old orphan Donny Mitchell, whose father and uncle died at sea. Longing for the sea, Donny has run away several times. Ann hopes the tough but fair Mary will bring some discipline into his life. The following day, Donny befriends Hod while hunting. Soon after, Hod, returning from a fishing trip on his boat with his partner, Portuguese Joe Sanger, discovers Donny on his lobster bank, having rowed out to it in a dingy and stolen two of Hob's lobsters, without knowing they belonged to Hod and Joe. Hod gives him a good telling off and returns him home to Mary and suggests that she let Donny work for him on his boat on Saturdays. She agrees and Donny is very happy out at sea on the boat and even catches a large halibut, his share of the catch earning him $5.75. This worries Ann, who has recently witnessed her friend Molly Thatcher's loss of her husband to the sea and she threatens to move the boy to an inland family if Hod allows Donny to go out to sea on his boat again. Reluctantly, Hod follows Ann's advice and tells Donny he cannot work for him any longer and that their partnership is ended. Very upset and feeling betrayed and rejected by Hod, Donny stands on the jetty and watches the boat go off into the distance without him, before going into town and stealing a camera from a drug store and selling it to make enough money for him to run away from home again and return to the sea. He steals a boat and puts to sea, but is caught in a terrible storm and has to be rescued by Hod and Joe. Realizing that she cannot prohibit Donny from being near the sea, Ann allows him to return to work for Hod. Donny goes to Hod and tells him the good news and Hod agrees to let Donny go out with him on his boat again. Happy beyond words, Donny runs home to tell Ann and Mary the good news, but as he runs into the house, he notices the local sheriff and the owner of the second hand shop to whom Donny sold the stolen camera are awaiting him. Ashamed, Donny admits the theft and begs Ann and Mary not to tell Hod he is being sent away to a reform school, fearing Hod will not want to see him anymore. Hod soon asks Ann about Donny's whereabouts. Ann does not tell him. Hod starts to investigate and finds out that Donny is in a reform school. Not wanting Donny to be in this situation, Hod prompts the state to let him adopt Donny. Donny initially refuses the adoption, ashamed of what he had done. However, when he finds out Hod is not mad at him, he allows himself to be reunited with him and he returns home accompanied by Hod and Ann.

Origin In 2018 a genetic study found that, just prior to 1859, a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd Dog, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: the Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Cane di Oropa, and the Pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai. Description The Cane di Oropa is a working dog, very obedient and possessed of great athletic ability, which is indispensable since the dog has to run up and down steep mountain slopes all day, managing the flock. Many Cane di Oropa specimens are naturally bobtailed. The coat is short or medium- length and can be smooth or somewhat rough. The coat color is usually merle, merle with black and tan markings, black or different shades of brown. The eyes should be brown and blue eyes are considered a fault.

The plot revolves around a pianist who purchases, solely as a hands-off investment, an apartment house full of loony tenants.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=254 Plot Concert pianist Eric Phillips (David Niven) has been on the road touring for twenty-one years when he finally returns home. One day he is served a warrant to perform repairs on the building he owns, and learns that his financial advisor, Peter Danilo, bought the building with his money some time ago as an investment. Eric goes to visit the building and meets some of its tenants. Among them the young and beautiful photo model Polly Haines (Jane Wyman), and Eric is instantly quite smitten by her. While they speak Polly's suitor, an insurance salesman, Bruce Arnold (Wayne Morris), arrives to the building. Being afraid of damaging his piano hands, Eric is convinced to buy an insurance for himself before he starts the building repairs. Eric and the rest of the tenants agree to fix up the building together during the next few weeks. They start off by building a roof garden with a day care center, and while the rest of the tenants go at it, Eric takes the kids on a hike. When he returns from the hike, a building inspector tells him that the building repairs are insufficient. Eric blames the former owner and present manager, Horace Willoughby (Victor Moore), for the poor quality of the work, and fires him on the spot. Polly comes to Horace's defense, telling Eric that he is a helpful soul who was unfortunate and had to sell the building to manage. Filled with remorse, Eric rehires Horace as chief of the repairs. Inevitably, Eric and Polly fall in love, much to Bruce's dismay, and he is beyond himself with jealousy. Eric takes advice from a musician friend, Madame Karina, and works less with his hands. Bruce somehow convinces Eric that Polly isn't really interested in him, and that she only led him on so that Bruce could sell him the insurance. Eric decides to go on a tour again, but before he has a chance to go, Horace locks him in with Polly in his apartment. They talk to each other and discover that both Bruce and Peter Danilo wanted Eric separated from Polly, for different selfish reasons. Eric then leaves on the tour, bringing Polly along, and it becomes their honeymoon trip.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/254/A-Kiss-in-the-Dark/ Cast * Jane Wyman as Polly Haines * David Niven as Eric Phillips * Wayne Morris as Bruce Arnold * Victor Moore as Horace Willoughby * Broderick Crawford as Botts References External links * Category:1949 films Category:1949 comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Harry Kurnitz Category:Films directed by Delmer Daves Category:Warner Bros. films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"A Kiss in the Dark (1949 film)"},{"id":"26187916","text":"T.

Based upon the 1961 novel The Sin of Susan Slade by Doris Hume, concerns a well-to-do teenage girl who secretly has a baby out of wedlock. With cinematography by Lucien Ballard, the film was released by Warner Bros. Plot After working for ten years in an isolated desert in Chile, mine manager Roger Slade (Lloyd Nolan) returns to the United States with his wife Leah (Dorothy McGuire) and their beautiful but naive 17-year-old daughter, Susan (Connie Stevens). During the journey, Susan has a shipboard romance with Conn White (Grant Williams), a wealthy young mountain climber. Susan and Conn make love in secret and plan to marry, but Conn wants to hold off making any announcement to their families until after he returns from his scheduled trip to Alaska to climb Mount McKinley. He travels on to Anchorage, while Susan and her parents go to Monterey and move into a home provided by Roger's grateful employer and longtime friend, Stanton Corbett (Brian Aherne). Roger has a serious heart condition which he has kept from his wife and daughter so as not to worry them; he has confided only in Stanton, who gave him a house, laboratory and life income so that Roger could rest and recover while giving his wife and daughter social opportunities. Susan waits eagerly for letters from Conn, but he does not write and the one time he calls, she is out and misses the call. She soon discovers that she is pregnant with Conn's child, but keeps this a secret while urgently trying to contact Conn. Her parents attempt to take her mind off Conn by encouraging her to date the Corbetts' son Wells (Bert Convy) and buying her a horse, which is kept at the stables run by Hoyt Brecker (Troy Donahue). Hoyt is shunned by the local community because his father, an executive with Corbett's company, was convicted for stealing from his employer, and later committed suicide in his prison cell. Compared to Susan's family and friends, Hoyt is relatively poor and lives on what he can earn from his stables (which have lost many customers due to the scandal involving his father) and as a struggling writer. Despite all this, Hoyt and Susan gradually become friends and he confides in her his determination to not run away in the face of local disapproval, but to instead become a renowned writer and redeem his family name. Susan finally receives a telephone call from Conn's father, whom she has never met, informing her that Conn had told his parents of his love for her and that Conn died climbing Mount McKinley. Susan has a breakdown and tries to drown herself in the bay, but is rescued by Hoyt. In her delirium, she lets slip to her mother that she is pregnant by Conn. Roger and Leah decide the only way to avoid disgrace and protect Susan is for the family to move to remote Guatemala, where Roger has been offered a two-year job running a mine. Susan can then finish her pregnancy and have her baby in secret, and Leah and Roger will pass it off as their own. All goes according to plan, but after the baby (named \\"Rogey\\" after Susan's father) is born, Susan has difficulty setting aside her maternal feelings and treating the baby as her brother rather than her son. Roger's heart condition worsens due to the stressful work at the mine, and he suddenly dies. Leah, Susan and baby Rogey return to their Monterey home, which Susan is dismayed to find has now been fixed up by the unsuspecting Corbetts to give her an apartment of her own, separated from the baby's room. Hoyt and Susan, who have been writing to each other regularly, renew their friendship and Hoyt professes his love for Susan, but Wells Corbett also begins to court Susan and soon proposes. Leah pushes Susan to accept Wells' proposal, but warns her never to tell Wells or anyone else the truth about Rogey's parentage, for fear that Rogey, Susan and the family name will be disgraced. Susan is reluctant to marry anyone because she would not be able to be honest with her future husband, but finally decides to marry Wells, just as Hoyt sells his first book to a publisher and rushes to tell Susan the good news. Hoyt and Susan argue over her decision to marry Wells, as Hoyt has a grudge against the Corbetts and also thinks Susan does not really love Wells. As they argue, baby Rogey accidentally sets himself on fire while playing with a cigarette lighter. Rogey is rushed to the hospital and the Corbetts, Slades and Hoyt all wait to hear the outcome. The doctor finally announces that Rogey will survive, but is seriously hurt and only his mother can see him. Susan, unable to hold back any longer, reveals that she is Rogey's true mother, which causes Wells to rescind his marriage proposal, although his father Stanton praises Susan for her honesty. However, Hoyt's feelings for Susan have not changed. Susan professes her true love for Hoyt, and they embrace.

(In the finished film, the theme from A Summer Place plays in the background during a scene where Susan and Conn embrace.) Filming took place in late 1960, with Bert Convy in his first significant role.

Plot Tom Adkins is a policeman from Barnstable, California working to uncover the truth behind two crimes; the disappearance of his son eight years earlier, and a fifty-year-old homicide of another boy.Entertainment Weekly - Rhona Mitra in Indie 'Boy in the Box' In the opening scenes, a mummified corpse is unearthed at a construction site. At first the policeman fears the body is that of his son, but also welcomes closure to the search. However, pathology demonstrates that these are the remains from a much older crime. The film continues with parallel stories in flashback, showing the events leading to the crimes and the investigation. The body is found with a burned toy, identical to one his own son had at the time of his disappearance, along with a whistle engraved with the words, \\"Keep the home fries burning\\". After noticing the similarities in the two cases, Adkins attempts to re-interrogate a local prisoner named Rogianni, a convicted murderer who the detective suspected in his son's disappearance. However, Adkins is rebuffed by the prison warden, due to earlier interrogations in which Adkins became violent. The investigation leads him to a man who lived in 1958 named Matthew Wakefield and his mentally disabled son, John. The striking similarities in the cases push Adkins‚Äô obsession over the top. Barely holding onto his sanity and bound by redemption, Adkins unravels the unspeakable truth behind what happened to his son.

Dr. Renne was also active in Washington D.C. and United States overseas agricultural economics work. He was the 1964 Democratic candidate for governor of Montana. Biography Roland Renne, born on December 12, 1905, was the third of five children born to Fred Christian Renne and Caroline Augusta (Young) Renne. Roland grew up on the family's truck and dairy farm in the remote Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey.Historical Note, Collection 2313 - Roland R. Renne Gubernatorial Campaign Papers, 1963-1966, Montana State University, lib.montana.edu As a boy, Roland helped his father on the farm and attended country schools. With the financial help of his father, he attended Rutgers University and graduated summa cum laud in 1927. He continued his education and obtained his Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics from University of Wisconsin in 1930. Rutgers University and University of Wisconsin are both land-grant schools and each influenced the development of Roland Renne's educational philosophy and championing of public education. There were two economists who heavily influenced Dr. Renne; the economist Richard T. Ely, who in 1892 was a founder of the Wisconsin University School of Economics, Political Science and History, and the economist John R. Commons, who was Ely‚Äôs assistant and a pioneering historian on the U.S. Labor Movement. Following his graduation in 1930, Renne arrived in Bozeman, Montana to start his teaching at Montana State College as Assistant Professor of Agriculture Economics. On August 19, 1932 he married Mary Polly Kneeland Wisner with whom he had four children. Dr. Roland R. Renne died in Bozeman, Montana on August 30, 1989. Professional life Professor and College President Dr. Roland R. Renne came to Montana State College in Bozeman, Montana in 1930 to work as Assistant Professor of Agricultural Economics. Dr. Renne was an Agricultural Economics Professor and Agriculture Department Head from 1930‚Äì1943 and President of Montana State College from 1943 - 1964. During the U.S. Depression years and World War II years, Renne devoted much of his time to educational outreach with small farmers and agricultural labor in support of both the WPA and World War II war efforts. As the Agricultural Economics Department head and chairman of the Bozeman city school board, Dr. Renne worked closely with the WPA to obtain New Deal educational funds for the construction of three new Bozeman, Montana elementary schools: Hawthorne, Irving and Longfellow. In 1942, Dr. Renne accepted a position in Montana‚Äôs Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply (OPA), but in the following year, 1943, Renne left OPA and was appointed Acting President of MSC. In 1944 Renne was appointed President of Montana State College. At the close of WWII, Renne recognized the G.I.Bill (Servicemen's readjustment Act) of 1944 passed by Congress was quickly increasing the demand for classrooms, additional faculty and increased student housing by new student G.I.s and their families. Because of the G.I. Bill, MSC's student body almost doubled from 1,155 in 1945 to 2,014 in 1946, and doubled again in 1947 to 3,591. With qualifying veterans returning to college at the end of the WW II, Renne provided active leadership to make the necessary changes on campus to accommodate those men and women who used the G.I. Bill to get a higher education degree at MSC. With a huge growth in students came an increase in faculty with the faculty almost doubling from 132 in 1945 to 257 in 1950. Renne Library on the MSU Campus To meet the immediate needs of G.I. student and faculty housing and expanded classrooms, Renne quickly installed recycled wooden buildings from a chrome mining project in Columbus, Montana to serve as classrooms for physics, chemistry lab, nursing, education, engineering, agriculture wool lab, psychology and music. To accommodate student and new faculty housing, Renne found prefab war-surplus wooden frame building, quonset huts, barracks, and over 100 small trailers. Then he went to the state capitol, Helena, Montana, and worked with the legislature to use some of the $4.5 million war surplus monies to fund a new brick library, update older buildings, and upgrade the physical plant. Renne also recognized that immediately following the end of WWII, only 16.9% of all instructional budget was spent on humanities and social sciences and called for substantial budgetary increases for liberal arts, citing a need for \\"a more realistic appreciation of the values of humanistic-social science subjects ... in the interests of serving the general welfare.\\" During this post WWII growth, Renne took on the added responsibility of educational outreach initiatives, speaking to various assemblies across the state in: Billings, Butte, Great Falls, Hamilton, Miles City, Three Forks, Eden, Joliet, Circle, Forsyth, Glendive, Helena, Hardin, Whitehall, Judith Gap, Ekalaka, Baker, Lodge Grass, Fort Peck, Sidney, and many more communities. He also expanded his outreach to conferences in: Wyoming, Washington, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, California, Missouri and others. Dr. Renne's presentations covered topics on: water resources, water conservation, river basin development, banking, farm economics, land management, Indian affairs, Christian stewardship, and the value of land-grant college education. In recognition of Dr. Roland R. Renne's service to Montana State College, the Montana State University named Renne Library in his memory. United States Government Service From 1950 to 1951 Dr. Roland Renne was the president of the Water Resources Policy Commission and in 1951 to 1953 he acted as chief of the Mutual Security Agency's Special Technological and Economic Mission to the Philippines. In 1958, he accepted the role of Chief of the Agricultural Survey Mission to Peru for the Joint International Bank for Reconstruction of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In 1960, Renne became a consultant regarding land development for the U.S. Operations Mission to Ethiopia, and in 1961 he became a member of the National Advisory Council for Health Research Facilities, HEW. Dr. Renne was the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs in Washington D.C. and through an appointment issued by then U.S. President John F. Kennedy, he also served as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs from 1963 to 1964. Renne also became one of the original board of trustees of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement.Flavier, Juan M., Doctor to the Barrios, page 6. By 1964 up to 1969, he was Director of Office of Interior Water Resources Research, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington D.C. After leaving the Water Resources Research Office in 1969, he was chief of the Agricultural University Development in Illinois/USAID Team for India until 1972. In 1974, Renne was Director of the Foreign Trade Study at Montana State University.Roland R. Renne, jfklibrary.org Political career In February 1964, Dr. Renne resigned as president of Montana State College to run for Governor of Montana in 1964. He defeated Mike Kuchera in the Democratic primary, and advanced to the general election, where he ran against incumbent Governor Tim M. Babcock. Renne, who was fifty-eight years old, had been associated with Montana State College for thirty-three years, was a respected Agricultural Economist, and had served in 1963 as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs. Babcock was running for re-election following his ascension to the Governorship in 1962 when the previous Governor, Donald Grant Nutter, died in a plane crash. In the Montana gubernatorial election, Renne placed emphasis on economic development in response to the 1964 sluggish economy, a need of greater support for education, relief for property taxes, and tax programs based upon ability to pay tax to fund his educational programs. Democrats also asserted that a Republican administration would adopt a sales tax and the institution of right-to-work law. Republicans and Babcock denied any plans for a sales-tax or right-to-work law and placed their emphasis on Governor Babcock's business- like administration of reduced deficit and balanced budget without new taxes, current support for education and custodial institutions, and that agriculture was the only area of Montana's economy not prospering. The election results had Democrat Roland Renne receiving 136,682 votes, and incumbent Republican Governor Tim Babcock receiving 144,113 votes.

Ladd stars along with Audrey Dalton, Charles Bronson as Captain Jack, and Hayden Rorke as President Ulysses S. Grant. Filmed in Sedona, Arizona, the story uses elements of the 1873 Modoc War in its narrative, with Ladd playing a white man asked by the U.S. Army to attempt negotiations with Native Modocs who are about to wage war. An early role for Charles Bronson (originally Buchinsky), who plays Captain Jack as a memorable villain wearing the coat of a deceased US Cavalry Captain. After murdering General Edward Canby (Warner Anderson) during a peace negotiation, Bronson puts on the late General's coat and announces to the audience \\"Me GENERAL Jack now!\\" Plot In 1872, veteran Indian fighter Johnny MacKay (Alan Ladd) is sent for by then President Grant (Hayden Rorke). He tells government officials in Washington about hostilities between settlers, soldiers and Modoc renegades near the California and Oregon border. He is appointed peace commissioner for the territory. On the way west, Johnny gives an escort to Nancy Meek (Audrey Dalton), a retired army colonel's niece. Nancy is traveling to a ranch owned by her aunt and uncle. There is an ambush outside Sacramento during which the sweetheart of their stage driver Bill Satterwhite is killed by a Modoc renegade. Later they find Nancy's aunt and uncle murdered and the ranch burned. The grown children of an old Modoc chief, Toby (Marisa Pavan) and Manok (Anthony Caruso), meet Johnny at Fort Klamath. They tell Johnny it is a chief who calls himself Captain Jack (Charles Bronson) and a band of renegades who are responsible for the brutality while most of the other Modoc wish to live in peace. They both served as intermediaries for the Modoc. Toby and Manok take Johnny and others to a peace talks near Lost River to discuss violations of the peace treaty signed by the Modoc in 1864 in hopes of bringing about peace again. When the violations are being discussed between Johnny and Captain Jack a vengeance crazed Satterwhite (Robert Keith) opens fire and kills the brave who killed his woman. A rampage results in which the renegades massacre 18 settlers. The Army responds but is unable to dislodge the renegade Modoc from their mountain stronghold and are forced to retreat with several casualties. After hearing of the massacre and the Army defeat President Grant orders General Canby's to act as a defensive force only. Once more peace talks were arranged but Toby and Manok warn of treachery. General Canby (Warner Anderson), Dr. Thomas (Richard Gaines), a Modoc sympathizer, Johnny and friend Mr. Dyar (Frank Ferguson) are to come unarmed but Johnny and Mr. Dyar come armed with revolvers hidden under their shirts. During the negotiations Captain Jack pulls a hidden revolver and kills the General as other Modoc pull theirs and start firing. Dr. Thomas is also killed. Johnny is shot but only wounded and unconscious and is about to be scalped when Toby tries to shield him from harm and is killed. Mr. Dyar escapes in a hail of bullets. The Army responds causing Captain Jack and the other Modoc to retreat back to their stronghold before Johnny can be killed. President Grant is forced to act because of the public outcry and orders Johnny to do whatever is necessary to bring Captain Jack to justice. The renegades are eventually dislodged from their stronghold and are forced to split up into separate groups. Soon most of the Modoc surrender leaving Captain Jack to survive on his own. He and Johnny have a shootout and hand-to- hand combat. Johnny prevails and places him under arrest. Captain Jack is jailed, put on trial and sentenced to hang. Afterwards Johnny returns to the woman he has fallen in love with, Nancy.

Meacham who was an American Methodist minister, reformer, and served as the U.S. Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon (1869‚Äì1872). At the time of the Peace Tent assassinations he was chairman of the Modoc Peace Commission. Toby (Winema) Riddle was one of the few Native American women to be honored by the US Congress authorizing a military pension for her because of her heroism and service. She lived until 1920. Captain Jack was hanged for General Edward Canby's murder, along with three of his warriors. The rest of the tribe was either returned to the Klamath Reservation in Oregon or relocated to Oklahoma. Canby, by the way, was the only U.S. Army general killed in a war against the Indians.

It stands for the principle that when the board is incapable of taking action, power to conduct the company's affairs will revert to the general meeting. Facts Canon Barron was not on speaking terms with Mr. William James Potter, the other director of the British Seagumite Co Ltd. Their office was 28 Fleet Street. The constitution said that the quorum for a meeting was two (art 26). Mr. Potter was the chairman, with a casting vote. But Canon Barron was refusing to come to meetings. So on 23 February 1914, Mr. Potter came to meet Canon Barron, as he got off the train on a Paddington Station platform, from his country home (Woodham Ferris, Essex). He told Canon Barron they were now holding a board meeting. He proposed appointing more directors. Canon Barron objected. Mr. Potter said he was using his casting vote, and declared the motion effective. The report recorded Mr. Potter's version of the exchange as follows: There followed a general meeting at which new directors were again said to be appointed, again with Canon Barron's objection. Canon Barron sought a declaration that the appointment of the directors were ineffective, arguing that the meeting on the train station was no meeting, and that the general meeting's resolution was invalid, since the board was the only organ that could appoint more directors. Judgment Warrington J held that in view of the deadlock, the power reverted to the general meeting. In this case, the appointments were valid. There had been no proper board meeting on the train platform, but the shareholder meeting was effective afterwards. Another case [1915] 3 KB 593 followed, with Atkin J in the High Court, and Warrington LJ again in the Court of Appeal.

Macdonald is a Canadian film and television executive. She has also held important administrative positions with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Macdonald was born in Prince Edward Island, and earned degrees in philosophy and communications from St. Francis Xavier University, Prince of Wales College and the University of Ottawa. Following her time at university, she worked as a theatrical producer and designer. She then became a partner in an independent film and television production company. In the 1980s she worked in various capacities for the Canadian government's Department of Communications, before in 1990 she joined the CRTC as its Director-General of Television. In this position, she was responsible for licensing television stations and dealing with Canadian content regulations. In 1992 she became President of the Canadian Film and Television Production Association (CFTPA), dealing with government bodies and industry regulators to represent independent production companies in Canada. In April 1995, Macdonald was appointed as the Government Film Commissioner, the Chairperson of the National Film Board. Following a report by a parliamentary committee into the role of the NFB, delivered in January 1996, Macdonald had to oversee a major restructuring of the NFB. Ancitipating a reduction in the NFB's budget of $20 million over the following three years, Macdonald oversaw the closure of the Board's own in-house sound stage and film laboratory; a move to using freelance film directors rather than NFB staff members; the almost-total abandonment of drama film production, and an overall loss of 180 staff positions. There were also positive artistic moments, however; in 1999 the NFB saw two of its animations, My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts and When the Day Breaks, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. In May 2000, the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada presented Macdonald with their Leadership Award for her \\"revitalization\\" of the NFB. Macdonald left the NFB in June 2001. At around this time, the CFTPA presented her with its Jack Chisholm Award, in recognition of her lifetime's achievements in the Canadian film and television industry. In September 2002 she became the President of the Canadian Television Fund, responsible for administering government investment in Canadian television production.

However, Michael falls ill and Lorenzo allows them both to stay. Debbie joins forces with Donna, the daughter of their mother's lover, to manipulate Moira into returning to Britain.

The screenplay was also written by Daves and was based on the 1912 play by Richard Walton Tully. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Plot Andre Laurence (Jourdan) takes a trip to a Polynesian island with his college roommate Tenga (Chandler). He assumes the native life and marries his friend's sister, Kalua (Paget). The island's volcano erupts, and the Kahuna, the island's shaman (Maurice Schwartz), decides that the volcano god can only be appeased by the human sacrifice of Kalua to its molten depths. Following her death, Andre says his goodbye to Tenga and returns to civilization.

It reunited several personnel from Broken Arrow including Deborah Paget, Delmer Daves, and Jeff Chandler. Chandler joked that his character was just a variation on his performance as Cochise in Broken Arrow. > The story is really about a conflict of worlds in 1850: a primitive people > who live by their beliefs and the civilization ‚Äì in quotes ‚Äì brought by the > white man. The problem is never resolved; even marriage can't do it ‚Äì but... > we used some wonderful locations and the scenery is breathtakingly > beautiful. Sterling Hayden was mentioned as a possibility for the male lead. Eventually Louis Jourdan was cast. Delmer Daves claims he wrote \\"a practically new story\\" from the play. It was Maurice Schwartz's second film role. The film was shot on location in Hawaii beginning in August 1950. Key locations were Hanalei Bay, Waikiki, Kona Coast and Volcano. Chandler had to be flown back every weekend to Los Angeles in order to fulfill his radio commitment to Our Miss Brooks. O'ahu native Queenie Ventura (married name Dowsett), born 1930, who was half pure Hawaiian and half Portuguese, joined the cast as a featured dancer and the local lead actress. Reception When the film was released, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film, writing, \\"There is certainly nothing original‚Äîor particularly blissful, we would say‚Äîabout the romantic tumble here taken by a visiting white man for a beauteous native maid...Unfortunately, Delmer Daves, who directed and wrote the script, either didn't or wasn't permitted to pitch the whole film in this slyly kidding vein. And the consequence is a rambling mishmosh of South Sea romance and travesty, of solemn high-priesting and low clowning, of never- never spectacle and sport.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, March 15, 1951. Last accessed: February 10, 2011. On the other hand, the staff at Variety magazine gave the film a favorable review, writing, \\"Richard Walton Tully's old legit piece, Bird of Paradise, makes another trip to the screen in a refurbished version. Previous filming of the play was in 1932 and, while Delmer Daves' version deviates from the Tully form, the essentials of the drama are still there, plus a beautiful Technicolor camera job, haunting island music and the use of actual locales...Paget hits a high level in her performance as the Princess Kalua. She, as well as the other players give their characters considerable sincerity. Jourdan is an excellent choice as the island visitor, as is Chandler as the prince.\\"Variety.

His most famous song is \\"Blaydon Races\\". He was a contemporary of Edward Corvan.Allan, Thomas, ed. (1891 [1972]) Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs; facsimile, with a new introduction by David Harker, ed. David Harker, pp. 446-9\\\\. Newcastle: Frank Graham. He has been described by a council source as a candidate for Tyneside's most famous songwriter.  Early life  George Ridley was possibly the best known of all the Tyneside performers /composers from that era. He was born in Gateshead on 10 February 1835, to Matthew Ridley (b 28 Sep 1807) and Frances Stephenson. He was sent to Oakwellgate Colliery as trapper-boy at around the age of around eight years, but soon moved on to The Goose Pit (The Gyuess), where he worked for 10 years before moving on. His next job was with the heavy Engineering firm of Messrs Hawks, Crawshay and Co as waggon-rider where he stayed for three years. Whilst working here he was involved in a serious accident involving a wagon which went out of control and crushed him. This left him with a severe injury, which resulted in his being unfit for regular (heavy or manual) work.  Later life  At this point he turned to performing as a means of support. One of his first venues as a professional was the Grainger Music Hall where he performed as a singer of Irish comic and old Tyneside songs. It was here that he introduced his first local song, Joey Jones. This was popular. He moved on to the Wheat-sheaf Music Hall (previously Balmbra's Music Hall, later renamed the Oxford) where he was also a success. He followed this by moving to the Tyne Concert Hall newly opened by Mr. Stanley where he introduced the \\"character\\" Johnny Luik-Up the Bellman. This proved a great hit, not least because the character was almost lifelike. His performances took him all over the North East of England, his songs sold well in cheap editions and children were singing the catchy tunes in the streets. He became well known for The Bobby Cure and Johnny Luik-Up characters. But he never fully recovered from the injuries he suffered whilst working at Messrs Hawkes, Crawshay and Co and after only a short 5-year career his health started to fail and after a short illness, he died at his residence in Grahamsley Street, Gateshead, on Friday, 9 September 1864 at age 30. He was buried at St. Edmund's Cemetery. There is a blue plaque (number 7837) on the wall of the William IV Public House, High Street, Gateshead (built on the site of a previous building in which he lived) inscribed \\"George \\"Geordie\\" Ridley (1835 ‚Äì 1864)\\"  Legacy  George Ridley was a Geordie born and bred; he wrote using the local Geordie dialect. He will never be remembered as a songwriter of great literary talent, but he did catch the spirit of the time, giving the audiences what they wanted, and the songs themselves have stood the test of time, many being just as well known and popular as when they were written. He apparently liked to be considered as a performer rather than a writer, and was well respected as such. He had a fine voice and was an artist in mimicry. Eric Burdon, the singer who first rose to fame as a member of The Animals is Ridley's great great nephew. Another family member, one of George's brothers, John Steven Ridley, came to fame on 10 March 1871 when he beat the English running champion in a one-mile race at Gateshead.

The Prince of Wales shaking hands with the members of the Ladies' Branch of the National Congress of British West Africa. The National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA), founded in 1917, was one of the earliest nationalist organizations in West Africa, and one of the earliest formal organizations working toward African emancipation.Eluwa, G. I. C., \\"Background to the Emergence of the National Congress of British West Africa\\" (African Studies Review, Vol. 14, No. 2. [1971], 205-218), 213. It was largely composed of an educated elite in the Gold Coast, who felt under threat from the incorporation of 'traditional authorities' in the colonial system.Michael R. Doortmont, The Pen-Pictures of Modern Africans and African Celebrities by Charles Francis Hutchison: A Collective Biography of Elite Society in the Gold Coast Colony, Brill, 2005, p. 29. The cofounders included Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr., the first President, and J. E. Casely Hayford, the first Vice-President. Other co- founders and early officials included Edward Francis Small, F. V. Nanka-Bruce, A. B. Quartey-Papafio, Henry van Hien, A. Sawyerr and Kobina Sekyi.  Founding   Inspiration  The idea of creating the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was first conceived in 1914 during a conversation \\"between J. E. Casely Hayford, a barrister from the Gold Coast\\" and \\"Dr. Akinwande Savage, a Nigerian doctor\\". Part of the inspiration for the creation of the NCBWA in the 1920s was growing concern that larger pan-African movements of the era were too broad in their scope and did not adequately address the concerns of West Africans. It was this desire to have a more consolidated scope for the development of nationalist aims that, in part, sparked the creation of the NCBWA in 1920.  Regional influences  The founding of the NCBWA was based on the existing legacy of resistance and nationalist movements throughout the colonies in British West Africa. Some of the resistance movements that influenced the development of the NCBWA were those by \\"King Aggrey of Cape Coast in the Gold Coast in the 1860s\\" and \\"King Kosoko of Lagos & Jaja of Opobo in the nineteenth century\\". The previous nationalist movements that sparked the creation of the NCBWA included the Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society (ARPS) and the Fante Confederation. The NCBWA was influenced not only by nationalist movements in the region but also by the works of key African nationalist scholars in the region, such as Dr. Africanus Beale Horton, Dr. Edward Wilmot Blyden, and John Payne Jackson.  International influences  The emergence of the NCBWA can also be contextualized within the larger, international nationalist movements of the early twentieth century that occurred on behalf of Africans and people of African descent specifically, and on behalf of subjugated peoples around the globe more broadly. Some of the international events that paved the way for the development of the NCBWA were the First Universal Races Congress of 1911, the International Conference on the Negro in 1911, the creation of the African Progress Union and Union of Students of African Descent in the United Kingdom in 1917, and the end of World War I.  Internal motivations  Throughout the nineteenth century, educated West African elite were permitted to serve as government officials throughout British West Africa, because the British colonial leaders saw the educated elite as necessary allies. However, by 1902, the favor that the British colonial leaders had previously given to the educated African elite began to diminish as a result of the institution of discriminatory policies, such as one issued by the ‚ÄúWest African Medical Service‚Äù that stated that educated Africans could only participate in the service if they were of ‚Äú¬´European¬ª parentage‚Äù. In addition to the use of discriminatory policies, the British colonial government began to exclude educated West Africans from local government positions, in favor of ‚Äúpreserving traditional authority‚Äù. This shift in favor occurred in an effort to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the indigenous populations from what the British colonial government perceived to be the tyranny of \\"a small minority of educated Europeanised natives who have nothing in common with [native peoples], and whose interests are often opposed to theirs\\". The growing alienation of the educated African elite from the British colonial leaders and the growing irritation of the educated elite in response to this alienation provided the backbone for the formation of the NCBWA.  Formation  A combination of regional, international, and internal influences and motivations culminated in the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) in March 1920. The foundation of the NCBWA was formalized with its first meeting in Accra, a meeting which drew participants from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, and the Gold Coast.  Agreements from the first meeting of the NCBWA  During the inaugural meeting of the NCBWA, a series of agreements were reached, which have been reproduced below: # \\" i. that half of the members of each of the Legislative Councils in British West Africa should be elected Africans, and that there should be in each colony a new House of Assembly consisting of all the members of the colony's Legislative Council and six other elected representatives, with control over finance;\\" # \\" ii. that municipal government should be developed to the extent that corporations with a majority of elected members and with full powers of local government are established in each principal town of each colony;\\" # \\" iii. that there should be no discrimination against Africans in the civil service;\\" # \\" iv. that executive and judicial functions should be separated and that only ¬´ duly qualified and experienced legal men should hold judicial appointments;\\" # \\" v. that a British West African Court of Appeal duly constituted should be established;\\" # \\" vi. that certain ¬´ obnoxious ¬ª ordinances and those objectionable ones relating to land should be repealed or modified as the case may be;\\" # \\" vii. that a West African university should be established and compulsory education introduced in all the four colonies;\\" # \\" viii. that foreign immigration should be controlled and ¬´ undesirable ¬ª Syrians repatriated;\\" # \\" ix. that the partitioning of African countries should not be done without first consulting the wishes of the peoples concerned;\\" # \\" x. that indigenous co-operative enterprises, to be directed by a ¬´ British West African Co-operative Association ¬ª, should be promoted;\\" # \\" xi. that a British West African Press, with an organ to be called the British West African National Review, should be established and,\\" # \\" xii. that laws that threaten ¬´ the liberty of the Press ¬ª should be repealed \\"  Influence of the NCBWA agreements  One of the agreements reached during the first meeting of the NCBWA, particularly the seventh agreement above regarding the establishment of a West African university, served as one of the earliest instances of a call for increased access to higher education in British West Africa and paved the way for further dialogue with regard to education policy throughout the colonies of British West Africa. The fourth agreement brought forth by the NCBWA was a critical stepping stone in redesigning the relationship between the colonial and the indigenous judicial systems. Specifically, dissent to the adjudication of a case known as the \\"Knowles trial\\" was informed in part by the fourth NCBWA agreement and catalyzed action on the part of the colonial government in Ghana to overhaul the judicial system to allow for defendants to have a right to a trial by jury and a right to \\"assistance of legal counsel\\". This reform came about as a result of \\"criticism of the criminal justice system in Ashanti\\" published in the Gold Coast Independent, a newspaper in the Gold Coast during the early twentieth century.  Branches of the NCBWA   The Gambia  The Gambian branch of the NCBWA developed when Gambian members of the larger NCBWA movement took over an existing organization with similar aims, known as the Gambia Native Defensive Union. The Gambian branch of the NCBWA was historically known as the ‚ÄúBathurst committee‚Äù, because Bathurst was the former name of the modern day capital city of The Gambia, Banjul. Among the key figures that made up the Gambian branch of the NCBWA were Edward Francis Small, John A. Mahoney, M. S. Oldfield, J. J. Oldfield, Jatta Joof, Benjamin J. George, M. S. J. Richards, S. J. Forster, Issac J. Roberts, and L. J. Roberts, who was the president of the Gambian branch. The main goal for the Gambian branch of the NCBWA was to successfully establish elected representation in the Gambian government that would include prominent elite members of Gambian society, as the Gambian branch was made up predominantly of members of the Creole middle class. In attempting to lobby for the creation of elected representation, the members of the Gambian branch were unable to determine how to best include the large Muslim community in The Gambia into the elected representation that they were setting out to achieve. This inability to determine how to best include the Muslim community led to the creation of internal factions which undermined the efforts of the Gambian branch. Another factor that also undermined the ability of the Gambian branch to meet its desired agenda was its inability to include the poorer, peasant citizenry into their discussions. Although the Gambian branch of the NCBWA was unsuccessful at achieving its goal of creating ‚Äúelected representation‚Äù in the colonial government, the branch was successful in meeting its economic aims. With the aid of Edward Francis Small , the Gambian committee was able to create the Gambia Co-operative Union to address some its economic concerns. The decline of the Gambian branch of the NCBWA came as a result of dissent from members of the Gambian colonial government as to the legitimacy of the need for representative government in the colony. Moreover, members of the colonial government believed that the Gambian elite who made up the Gambian branch were actually of Sierra Leonean origin and thus could not effectively speak on behalf of the citizens of The Gambia.  Nigeria  The Nigerian branch of the NCBWA was historically referred to as the \\"Lagos committee\\". Prior to the formal establishment of the Lagos branch of the NCBWA, there were several talks among the political elite of Lagos to gain wider support for the movement. Some of the principal members of the original committee in Lagos included Dr. Richard Akinwande Savage, Dr. John K. Randle, and J. G. Campbell. Crucial to the development of the NCBWA effort in Lagos was the support of members of the Muslim community and thus, \\"Karimu Kotun, one of the influential Lagos Muslims, was appointed Assistant Secretary.\\" This initial committee experienced difficulty in working effectively because Dr. Savage and Dr. Randle had personal grievances. It was as a result of the irreconcilable differences between Dr. Savage and Dr. Randle that a new committee with wider-ranging ties throughout Nigeria was formed. In an effort to widen the reach of the Lagos Branch of the NCBWA, the members of the new committee sought to include members of the traditional governance structures, such as ‚ÄúObas and Chiefs‚Äù. The Lagos branch of the NCBWA was formally established on June 21, 1920. During the first meeting of the newly created Lagos Branch of the NCBWA, the committee members decided to ‚Äúestablish branches of the Congress in different parts of Nigeria‚Äù. Another major meeting of the newly formed Lagos branch of the NCBWA occurred on October 16, 1920. During this second meeting, three resolutions were passed that helped to outline the scope of the work of the Lagos branch of the NCBWA, to determine the methodology for securing funds for the organization, and to give support for the members of the Lagos branch who had been sent to England with other members from other branches of the NCBWA to serve as the representatives for the people of Lagos.  Sierra Leone  The crucial moments in the development of the Sierra Leonean branch of the NCBWA were meetings that were convened on April 29, 1918, and on May 6, 1918. The first meeting in April was critical in that it helped to establish the desired goals of a \\"West African Conference\\", particularly that such a conference would bring the West African colonies together and give voice to the concerns of the West African peoples. The second meeting in May was notable for its articulation of the leadership of the Sierra Leonean branch of the NCBWA, which was made up of 42 members from various contingents of the West African elite. The Sierra Leonean branch of the NCBWA was formally created in February 1919. This newly formed committee later attended a meeting of the larger, parent NCBWA in Accra.The contributions of the Sierra Leonean delegation to the Accra conference included recommendations \\"for the improvement of the medical services in the colonies\\" as well as calls for the \\"expulsion of the Lebanese\\", who were seen as \\"an economically strong and alien minority\\". Following the first meeting of members of all branches of the NCBWA in Accra, Ghana, the second conference of the NCBWA was held in Freetown, Sierra Leone in 1923. During this meeting, Congress members discussed constitutional reforms, the development of a \\"West African Court of Appeal\\", medical reforms, and the development of a West African press. Throughout the duration of the Sierra Leonean branch of the NCBWA, questions about the formation of the Congress were raised, with particular concern about the degree to which the concerns of the elite founders of the Congress movement in Sierra Leone matched the concerns of the indigenous peoples in the colony. Some in the colonial government also feared that the Congress in Sierra Leone was \\"too large and too grandiose\\", and because of this \\"grandiosity\\" there would be difficulties in procuring the funds that would need to be used to sustain the Congress. Despite these concerns, the Sierra Leonean branch of the NCBWA outlasted its counterparts in Nigeria, the Gold Coast, and The Gambia by about 10 years, officially ending in the late 1940s.  Legacy   International interactions   London  Following a March 1920 conference of the NCBWA in Accra, two members from each of the branches of the NCBWA went to London in September 1920. The goal of this meeting was to get formal recognition from the King of England for the resolutions that the NCBWA had agreed upon in Accra. However, when the NCBWA delegation arrived in London, they were not allowed to meet with the Secretary of State because the colonial governors from the NCBWA representatives‚Äô respective nations regarded the NCBWA as a movement that was both unnecessary and unrepresentative of the aims of the indigenous peoples of British West Africa.  The UNIA and the NCBWA  Another pan-African movement that arose during the same time as the NCBWA was the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), a pan-African movement led by Marcus Garvey that wanted to create \\"an independent black republic over the entire continent of Africa\\". In its attempts to maintain its dominance among West African elites, the NCBWA publicly denounced and derided the formation of the UNIA as illegitimate and dangerous. Moreover, the NCBWA said that the viewpoint of the members of the UNIA was American and thus incompatible with the struggles and needs of the indigenous, African peoples. The main point of contention between the UNIA and the NCBWA was that the NCBWA did not want African nations to be independent from their colonial leaders but rather wanted to ensure that the West African elite were adequately represented in the colonial government. Similarly to the NCBWA, the UNIA established branches throughout West Africa in order to promulgate its message throughout the region and in the process gained the support of West African elites who would have otherwise joined the NCBWA. Despite the political differences and competition between the UNIA and NCBWA, however, both of the organizations came together following the economic hardship brought about by World War I to help increase the economic prospects of Africans at home and abroad.  The decline of the NCBWA  The formal parent organization of the NCBWA began to decline following an unsuccessful trip to London to convince the king of the legitimacy of the NCBWA. Some of the branches of the NCBWA continued to exist even after the decline of the larger NCBWA organization.The decline of the NCBWA was also influenced by gradual movements towards \\"territorial nationalist movements\\" that focused on advancing nationalist aims specific to the branches of the NCBWA rather than pursuing general principles that applied to all of British West Africa. This trend was inspired by similar measures occurring in the former French West African countries, as they began to get \\"representative assemblies\\" specific to particular nations rather than to the larger, West African region.

They persisted for a year without a vocalist until Siki Spacek joined; Spacek would also fulfill roles as a guitarist for the band alongside Hicks. The band would not have an official name until nearly two years after its creation; Hicks and Pinkins eventually decided on \\"Black Death.\\" Shortly thereafter, Pinkins was shot and killed. The resulting lineup changes consisted of two new bassists, the latter of which, Darell Harris, would be added as Pinkins' permanent replacement sometime before 1984. At the end of the band's first major hiatus, which lasted from 1988 to 2009, the lineup took another significant turn when the band was officially re-formed as \\"Mandrake.\\" There was an unofficial change in 2007 by Bullard in an effort to change Black Death's name, but this wasn't fulfilled until after his death in 2008 from colon cancer. The band was then split into two separate groups, one of which was rechristened as Siki Spacek and the Resurrection (later known as Black Death Resurrected, which was Bullard's original idea for the band's new name); the second group toured until disbanding in 2010. Currently, the band's activities and scheduling, along with other announcements, are actively being listed on their Facebook page.

A 2017 compilation of older recording was also released, and is currently Black Death's only recording available on Spotify. Additionally, Black Death's first LP has been re-released in physical format by records and distribution company Hell's Headbangers.

Resolution 713 was the first resolution that concerned the breakup of Yugoslavia. In the resolution, the Council expressed its full support of the arrangements and measures undertaken by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to consolidate an end to the hostilities in Yugoslavia, inviting the Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, in consultation with the Yugoslavian government, to assist in the process. It also urged all parties concerned to strongly observe the ceasefire agreements of September 1991 and enter into negotiations at the Conference on Yugoslavia and avoid committing any actions that may increase tension in the region. Noting the continued hostilities, the resolution also implemented an embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia until the Council decided otherwise, passing this aspect of the resolution under Chapter VII as it deemed the situation to be a threat to international peace and security. Also, since Yugoslav National Army was under control from capital Belgrade it is by some considered that other Yugoslav countries were put in inferior position since the warfare continued. The resolution would apply to all the constituent states that made up Yugoslavia, even on their independence; however, Bosnia and Herzegovina contested the ruling by stating it only applied to Yugoslavia when it existed, and therefore after the independence of constituent countries it no longer had effect.

Their official website describes them as \\"group of like-minded people who desire our God given Individual Freedoms which were written out by the Founding Fathers. We believe in Limited Government, Free Speech, the 2nd Amendment, our Military, Secure Borders and our Country!\\" The group was created by former Shelby County, Tennessee assistant district attorney Judson Phillips in 2009. It runs a social networking site for conservative activists and is best known for organizing the 2010 National Tea Party Convention. In February 2010, Tea Party Nation was among the twelve most influential groups in the Tea Party movement, according to the National Journal. In September 2010, it was one of the top five most influential organizations in the Tea Party movement, according to the Washington Post. National Tea Party Convention Tea Party Nation organized the National Tea Party Convention held February 4‚Äì6, 2010. Around 600 activists attended the event, and Sarah Palin was featured as the keynote speaker. The event was criticized for its $549 ticket price, as well as the fact that Palin was apparently paid US$100,000 for her appearance. Palin has said she will donate the fee to unspecified conservative causes. Several prominent conservative organizations refused to participate in the event due to its for-profit nature. The Tea Party Patriots advised members not to participate in December 2009. Erick Erickson of the conservative blog RedState.com described the convention as \\"scammy\\" on January 11. The American Liberty Alliance (ALA), initially a co-sponsor, withdrew its support on January 13.Our decision to sit out of the Tea Party Convention ¬´ American Liberty Alliance Later in January, Michele Bachmann and Marsha Blackburn cancelled their plans to speak. At the convention, it was announced that a 501(c)(4) corporation and political action committee (PAC) called \\"Ensuring Liberty\\" would be formed to support candidates for office in the 2010 elections.New Tea Party PAC: Can it raise $10 million for midterm revolt? / The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com A subsequent convention was booked for the following July, postponed until October, and ultimately cancelled. On July 18, 2011 the Venetian Casino Resort filed suit for unpaid bills allegedly totaling $642,144. A judge ordered Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips to pay $748,000, including the $554,000 hotel bill and $194,300 in accrued interest, for the 1,637 reserved rooms. Criticism Tea Party Nation is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and is the only Tea Party-related group to be noted as such. Comments on voting rights Tea Party Nation and especially its founder have generated criticism and controversy. For example, founder Judson Phillips claimed that voting rights should be restricted to property owners. Reaction to Keith Ellison candidacy In an October 2010 statement endorsing Lynne Torgerson (the Independence Party of Minnesota candidate for Minnesota's 5th congressional district), Phillips made an anti-Islam critique against Representative Keith Ellison. Phillips' critique asserted that Ellison is unfit for Congress in part because Ellison is Muslim. The candidate Phillips endorsed was also controversial for her assertion that Islam \\"is not 'religion' recognizable under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\\" Reaction to Gabrielle Giffords assassination attempt Phillips is also known for the controversial comments he made after the attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), and the murders of a federal district judge and others, during a shooting spree on January 8, 2011. He described the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, as \\"a leftist lunatic,\\" apparently because one person who knew Loughner in high school said he was a liberal several years ago. Phillips instructed members of Tea Party Nation to blame liberals for the attempted assassination to defend the tea party movement's recent electoral gains: \\"The hard left is going to try and silence the Tea Party movement by blaming us for this,\\" likening the expected blowback to the criticism heaped on \\"conservative talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh\\" for the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. One commentator, Garance Franke-Ruta, wrote about the group, \\"Showing no sign of tamping down on divisive political rhetoric in the wake of the shooting of 20 people that left six dead in Tucson Saturday, the Tea Party Nation group e-mailed its members Sunday warning them they would be called upon to fight leftists in the days ahead and defend their movement.\\" Writing on Forbes.com, Rick Ungar called the e-mail a \\"deeply disturbing memo.\\" Ungar continued, \\"It was immediately clear that Mr. Phillips is far more concerned about his own political interests and power than he is with the health of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords or in experiencing even the tiniest measure of compassion for the families who lost loved ones in this awful attack.\\" Reaction to Boston Marathon bombing After the Boston Marathon bombing, Judson Phillips wrote, \\"There are two reasons why we will be hit again. First, we have a determined enemy who hates us. Second, we have a government that is not committed to protecting America.\\" Philips also wrote an opinion piece which questioned \\"Why is the Regime [the Obama Administration] in such a hurry to get him [Saudi national Abdul Rahman Ali Alharbi] out of the country?\\"\\"Terrorism Questions That Should Be Answered Now\\" The Christian Post See also *Patriot movement References External links * Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Tea Party movement Category:Organizations established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in the United States ","title":"Tea Party Nation"},{"id":"26188570","text":"Extra Medium Kick Ball Star (17) is the 4th album by California Punk band Fifteen.

For abuse Victim playing by abusers is either:Bailey-Rug C (2015) Life After Narcissistic AbuseBailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish * Dehumanization, diverting attention away from acts of abuse by claiming that the abuse was justified based on another person's bad behavior (typically the victim). * Grooming for abusive power and control by soliciting sympathy from others in order to gain their assistance in supporting or enabling the abuse of a victim (known as proxy abuse). It is common for abusers to engage in victim playing. This serves two purposes: * Justification, to themselves, in transactional analysis known as existential validation, as a way of dealing with the cognitive dissonance that results from inconsistencies between the way they treat others and what they believe about themselves. * Justification to others as a strategy of evading or deflecting harsh judgment or condemnation they may fear from others. For manipulation Manipulators often play the victim role (\\"woe is me\\") by portraying themselves as victims of circumstances or someone else's behavior in order to gain pity or sympathy or to evoke compassion and thereby get something from someone. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering, and the manipulator often finds it easy and rewarding to play on sympathy to get cooperation. While portraying oneself as a victim can be highly successful in obtaining goals over the short-term, this method tends to be less successful over time: :Victims‚Äô talent for high drama draws people to them like moths to a flame. Their permanent dire state brings out the altruistic motives in others. It is difficult to ignore constant cries for help. In most instances, however, the help given is of short duration. And like moths in a flame, helpers quickly get burned; nothing seems to work to alleviate the victims‚Äô miserable situation; there is no movement for the better. Any efforts rescuers make are ignored, belittled, or met with hostility. No wonder that the rescuers become increasingly frustrated ‚Äî and walk away.Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries (2014).

Bacon admitted that they were created as an exorcism of his sense of loss following the suicide of his former lover and principal model, George Dyer.Dawson & Sylvester, 108 On the evening of 24 October 1971, two days before the opening of Bacon's triumphant and career-making retrospective at the Grand Palais, Dyer, then 37, alcoholic, deeply insecure and suffering severe and long-term depression, committed suicide through an overdose of drink and barbiturates in a room at the Paris hotel Bacon had allowed him to share during a brief period of reconciliation following years of bitter recrimination.\\"Triptych - August 1972\\". Tate. Retrieved February 13, 2010. Bacon, a near-alcoholic himself, felt an acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life after his former lover's death. This awareness was heightened by the death of many other close friends during the following decade. The most acute paintings after the loss of his friends are considered to be the many images of Dyer, including the three \\"Black triptychs\\", Three Portraits: Posthumous Portrait of George Dyer, Self- Portrait, Portrait of Lucian Freud of 1973, and numerous heads painted within three years of 1972. Each triptych shows views from moments before, during and after Dyer's death.T√≥ib√≠n, Colm. \\"Such a Grip and Twist\\". The Dublin Review, 2000. The scenes are not represented linearly; they do not always read from left to right. Each shows a comatose man, collapsed or dead near the hotel room's lavatory seat. In most, Dyer is followed by black horizontal fleshy winged creatures, raw and red/pink blobs of dying flesh, or by painterly arrows. These devices act both as pointers to the depravity and tragedy of the scene and as manifestations of Bacon's guilt at the death of an emotionally dependent friend. Background Dyer's suicide Bacon met Dyer‚Äîin an often repeated but likely fictitious story‚Äîwhen he caught the younger man breaking in through the roof of his flat in a failed burglary. Dyer was then in his early 30s, tall and athletic, and largely uneducated and from an impoverished East London background‚Äîall of which appealed to Bacon's taste for rough trade. There was an immediate connection between the two men, and from the mid-1960s Dyer became Bacon's principal model and muse. However, while Bacon's fame grew and critical attention of the successful portraits of Dyer brought the younger man a degree of fame and notoriety, the focus on Bacon as the star of the art world overshadowed Dyer's neediness, and he inevitably came to see himself as just another associate and hanger-on. Dyer photographed by John Deakin, retouched by Bacon, who often folded or creased, or spattered with paint, photographs of friends so as to find distortions he could exploit in his paintings. Although Dyer was handsome and charming in his own raw way, he was out of his depth when dealing with both Bacon's wasp-tongued Soho set and intellectual art world friends. He barely understood or liked the older man's portraits, even though they were the sole reason he was tolerated and allowed to drink with his Soho circle of friends. He admitted of Bacon's paintings; \\"I think they are really horrible and I don't really understand them.\\" When insecurity set in, Dyer defended himself by drinking from when he woke until when he collapsed.Peppiatt, 211 Dyer quickly grated on Bacon's art- world friends, who were by then his only friends, but for whom he had lost whatever charm he had begun with‚Äînot much, they believed. Bacon tired of the routine of carrying Dyer emotionally and often physically home. Dyer planted cannabis in Bacon's Meuse and rang the police after one occasion. After a later attempt during a visit to New York when Bacon tried to end the relationship, Dyer threatened to jump from a skyscraper, and police again became involved. Bacon said, \\"He became totally impossible with drink. The rest of the time, when he was sober, he could be terribly engaging and gentle. He used to love being with children and animals. I think he was a nicer person than me. He was more compassionate. He was much too nice to be a crook. That was the trouble. He only went in for stealing because he had been born into it, into that whole East End atmosphere where it's expected of you. Everybody he knew went in for it. If he'd had any discipline, he could have got a job easily, because he was very good with his hands. I got him something with my framer - he was going to learn gilding, which pays very good money. But he didn't make anything of it. I can understand that it's much more exciting to steal than to go out to a job every day, but in the end he did nothing but go and get completely drunk. In that way, my life has been a disaster. So many of the people I've known have been drunks or suicides, and all the ones I've been really fond of have died in one way or another. And it's only when they're dead that you realize just how fond of them you were.\\"In interview with David Sylvester When the relationship finally lost its spark and faded out, Dyer found himself adrift and alone, and descended into full-blown alcoholism, supplemented by anti-depressants and occasional amphetamine abuse. His dependency on Bacon continued from the late 1960s until 1971, when feeling pity, Bacon invited his former lover to attend his retrospective in Paris. Though dry at the time, Dyer was overwhelmed by the occasion and took refuge in quantities of drink and pills with which his body was no longer able to cope. Bacon was informed of the suicide on the eve of the official opening. Though devastated, he continued to meet and greet the assembled critics, dealers and collectors. Most friends who were present believed that that night he displayed powers of self-control to which, according to biographer John Russell, \\"few of us could aspire\\".Russell, 151 Yet Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer; he had recently lost four other close friends, two of them lovers, as well as his childhood nanny, also a gambling friend in his adulthood. From this point on, death haunted both his life and work, and became the dominant theme.Russell (1971), 178 Aftermath Center panel from Bacon's Study for a Self-Portrait‚ÄîTriptych, 1985‚Äì86. This work was painted after an extended period of examination of the effect of age and time on both himself his close friends, during a period when many those around him died. Tied to the black triptychs in theme, format, structure and tone, this work is considered the masterpiece of his late period.Sylvester (2000), 168 Throughout his career, Bacon consciously and carefully avoided giving any meaning or reason to his paintings, and pointedly stated that it was not his intention to convey any sort of narrative in his work. When Melvyn Bragg challenged him in a 1985 BBC interview with the observation that Triptych, May‚ÄìJune 1973 was the nearest he had come to telling a story, Bacon admitted that \\"it is in fact the nearest I've ever done to a story, because you know that is the triptych of how he [Dyer] was found\\". He went on to say that the work reflected not just his reaction to Dyer's death, but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him \\"like flies\\".\\"People have been dying around me like flies and I‚Äôve had nobody else to paint but myself ... I loathe my own face, and I‚Äôve done self-portraits because I‚Äôve had nothing else to do\\". Sylvester, 129 He explained how his old friends were \\"generally heavy drinkers\\" and that their deaths led directly to his composition of the meditative mid-1970s to mid-1980s self-portraits which highlighted his aging and awareness of the pace of time, often using a ticking clock as a motif for the passing of time.Bragg, Melvyn. \\"Francis Bacon\\". South Bank Show. BBC documentary film. Aired 9 June 1985. The motif of an expensive watch was at a time when homosexuality was illegal and kept underground in Britain, a common indicator to rough trade.Pipatte Bragg asked if the portraits painted in the wake of Dyer's death were depictions of his emotional reaction, Bacon explained that he did not consider himself to be an \\"expressionist painter\\". He said he was \\"not trying to express anything, I wasn't trying to express the sorrow about somebody committing suicide ... but perhaps it comes through without knowing it\\". When Bragg inquired if he often thought about death, the artist replied that he was always aware of it, and that although \\"it's just around the corner for [me], I don't think about it, because there's nothing to think about. When it comes, it's there. You've had it.\\" Later in the interview, while reflecting on the loss of Dyer, Bacon observed that as part of aging, \\"life becomes more of a desert around you\\".Sinclair, Andrew. \\"Francis Bacon: his life and violent times\\". London: Crown Pub, 1993. 299. He told Bragg that he believed in \\"nothing. We are born and we die and that's it. There is nothing else.\\" Bragg asked Bacon what he did about that reality, and after the artist told him he did nothing about it, Bragg observed, \\"No Francis, you try and paint it.\\" Series The three works, In Memory of George Dyer, Triptych‚ÄìAugust 1972 and Triptych, May‚ÄìJune 1973, are grouped by critics because they share title, date, format, subject matter and a stark black background intended as emblematic of death and mourning.Typically obtuse, Bacon would not admit to this explanation for his use of black While they are linked as a unified response to Dyer's suicide, their completion was punctuated by a number of individual portraits and other triptychs featuring Dyer, including the 1972 Three Studies of Figures on Beds which is both a celebration of the younger man's life and a lamentation of his early death.Sylvester (2000), 136 The Tate gallery display caption for Triptych‚ÄìAugust 1972 reads, \\"What death has not already consumed seeps incontinently out of the figures as their shadows.\\"\\"Triptych - August 1972\\". tate.org.uk. Retrieved on February 11, 2010. A number of other characteristics bind the triptychs. The form of a monochromatically rendered doorway features centrally in all, and each is framed by flat and shallow walls.Davies & Yard, 65 In many, Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in some panels, or the wings of the angel of death in others.Davies & Yard, 67‚Äì76 These shadows have been viewed by art critic Davis Sylvester as silhouettes of avenging prey, or in Baconian language \\"evocations of Aeschylean Furey\\". Bacon never recovered from Dyer's suicide and from then on his work became haunted by an awareness of loss, death and the effects of passage of time on those around him. He later admitted that \\"... although one is never exorcised, because people say you forget about death ... you don't ... time doesn't heal. But you concentrate on something which was an obsession, and what you would have put into your obsession you put into work.\\"Sylvester, 136 See also * List of large triptychs by Francis Bacon * Triptychs by Francis Bacon References Bibliography * Baldassari, Anne.

Hussain has also served on the National Security Council and in the Department of Justice as a trial attorney and a criminal and national security prosecutor. In his role as Envoy to the OIC, the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, Hussain traveled to numerous countries and international gatherings, served as a foreign policy advisor, and met with foreign leaders and Muslim communities around the world. His position, \\"a kind of ambassador at large to Muslim countries was created by President George W. Bush,\\" and the Washington Post described Hussain as member of the President Obama's \\"spiritual cabinet.\\" Upon appointing the 31-year old White House attorney as one of the youngest posted American ambassadors and highest ranking Muslim American officials Obama stated: \\"as an accomplished lawyer and a close and trusted member of my White House staff, Rashad has played a key role in developing the partnerships I called for in Cairo, and as a Hafiz of the Quran, he is a respected member of the American Muslim community, and I thank him for carrying forward this important work.\\" Hussain has also been actively involved in international religious freedom and counterterrorism efforts, and his appointment as Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications was announced by President Obama at a White House Summit in 2015. Hussain, who has been named one of the world's 500 most influential Muslims, outlined a strategy for countering terrorist propaganda emphasizing a shift to non-governmental messaging, helped develop messaging centers in the UAE, Nigeria, Malaysia, and in Saudi Arabia, and helped set up the framework for the U.S. Global Engagement Center.  Early life and education  Hussain was born in Wyoming and was raised in Plano, Texas, the son of Indian-American immigrants. His father, Mohammad Akbar Hussain, was a mining engineer. His mother Ruqaiya, his older sister Lubna and his younger brother Saad are medical doctors. Hussain is a graduate of Greenhill School in Dallas, Texas. While at Greenhill, Hussain was a member of the school's nationally recognized policy-debate team, partnering with Josh Goldberg to win the Texas state debate championship and a number of national competitions. Hussain completed a bachelor's degree in two years, in both philosophy and political science, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. His philosophy thesis was titled \\"Assessing the Theistic Implications of Big Bang Cosmological Theory.\\" He holds an MPA from the John F. Kennedy School of Government and a Masters degree in Arabic and Islamic Studies, both from Harvard University, and a J.D. from Yale Law School. At Yale, he served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal. After college, but before entering law school, he worked as a legislative aide for the House Judiciary Committee, where he served during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and reviewed the USA Patriot Act and other bills. He was a 2003 Fellow of the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. Following law school, Hussain served as a law clerk for civil rights icon Damon J. Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Public service career Office of White House Counsel In January 2009, Hussain was named Deputy Associate Counsel to President Barack Obama. Previously, he served as a trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice and as Associate Counsel to the Obama Presidential Transition Team. The Washington Post reported that, \\"After the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House Counsel's office by Greg Craig and Cassandra Butts, a fellow Tar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new media issues, and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts. Mr. Hussain also \\"began advising the president on issues related to Islam after joining the White House counsel‚Äôs office in January 2009.\\" Ben Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter and Deputy National Security Advisor, sought Hussain's counsel as he drafted the president's Cairo address and other speeches to Muslim audiences. Hussain also joined the President and the staff that traveled to Egypt for the speech at Cairo University in 2009. Diplomatic Posts: U.S. Special Envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation On February 13, 2010, President Obama appointed the 31-year old Hussain as the United States Special Envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The Washington Post stated in addition to his personal background, \\"Muslims abroad are ... likely to take note of his White House credentials, and access to the Oval Office, as he seeks partnerships in education, health, science and technology.\\" Rashad Hussain with President Yudhoyono of Indonesia It also noted that Hussain \\"briefed Obama before his first interview as president--with Al Arabiya, contributed to Obama's two major speeches to Muslims--in Ankara, Turkey and Cairo, traveled to the Middle East with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and, closer to home, helped organize a Ramadan dinner at the White House that replaced the usual crowd of ambassadors with young American Muslims.\\" He also helped put on a 2010 Presidential Global Entrepreneurship Summit hosted by President Obama. Former Afghan President Karzai greets Rashad Hussain in Kabul in 2012 During his travel to OIC member countries, Hussain has held meetings with a number of leaders, including President Karzai of Afghanistan, President Gul of Turkey, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia, President Zardari of Pakistan, Prime Minister Aziz of Mauritania, President Sall of Senegal, President Buhari of Nigeria, and OIC Secretary General Ihsanoglu.Special Envoy Hussain‚Äôs Meetings at the OIC Heads of State Summit in Mecca, U.S. Department of State announcement, August 15, 2012. Hussain also attended the OIC Heads of State Summit in Egypt and in Mecca, Saudi Arabia is 2012, where he met with a number of leaders, including a pre-dawn Ramadan meal with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and held other meetings with President Gul of Turkey and President Karzai of Afghanistan. They discussed a number of issues, including Syria, the democratic transitions in the Middle East and North Africa, and U.S. engagement with Muslim communities around the world. Hussain also led an international peacemaking delegation to the Central African Republic in 2014 to meet with President Samba-Panza and civil society leaders. Hussain with students in India While Hussain served as Special Envoy, the U.S. and OIC increased cooperation in health and development, including OIC-USAID cooperation on humanitarian aid, and have expanded partnerships in entrepreneurship, and science and technology. The OIC has been increasingly active in condemning violent extremism, including attacks on religious minorities, and the kidnapping of school girls by Boko Haram in Nigeria. The U.S. worked with the OIC to eliminate the OIC's previous heavily criticized \\"defamation of religion\\" resolution at the UN and replace it with a resolution that removes the \\"defamation\\" concept and seeks to counter intolerance without restricting speech in a manner inconsistent with U.S. law. The OIC has also taken a larger role in international affairs - it was among the first to call for a no-fly zone in Libya and has been heavily critical of Bashar al-Assad's regime, removing Syria from the OIC in 2012. Hussain meeting with Prime Minister Najib, President Obama, and Secretary of State Clinton  Counterterrorism Post: U.S. Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications  In 2015, The Washington Post reported that Hussain was appointed to shift US messaging efforts by building partnerships with international NGOs and other governments to counter terrorist propaganda. Hussain outlined an approach for \\"supporting NGOs who are countering ISIL‚Äôs narrative and helping other countries to establish their own counter-ISIL messaging centers\\" and highlighting ISIS's damage to local populations, \\"emphasizing accounts of [ISIS] defectors, and documenting its losses on the battlefield ‚Äî without recirculating its gruesome images or matching its snide tone.\\" Hussain called for messaging to highlight terrorists' damage to Muslim and other populations, the stories of \\"defectors,\\" ISIS's battlefield losses, and living conditions in ISIS territories. He also called for \\"Muslim-hosted and run messaging initiatives to take a leading role\\" in expanding \\"counter- messaging and positive narratives.\\" In 2015, Hussain worked with international organizations in leading an international defectors messaging campaign to highlight the stories of those who left terrorist organizations. Hussain co- authored a paper, \\"Reformulating the Battle of Ideas: Understanding the Role of Islam in Counterterrorism Policy\\" for the Brookings Institution. It sharply rejects those who commit terrorist acts in the name of religion, including those who seek to use Islamic justifications for such actions. Hussain with King Abdullah and Secretary of Defense Gates In a speech to a meeting of Foreign Ministers from 56 Muslim-majority countries, Hussain stated, \\"It is our duty to eradicate this ideology completely and blaming the foreign policy of any country is not the answer. No policy grievance justifies the slaughter of innocent people.\\" He has also held discussions on the topic of violent extremism with government and civil society in trips to countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen. Hussain with Turkish President Gul In addressing extremism, Hussain has also argued that Muslim communities must improve secular and religious education for boys and girls, increase access to opportunity through job creation, address the sense of political disenfranchisement in Muslim communities, and improve deradicalization programming. In a panel hosted by Peter Bergen on online radicalization in 2013, Hussain described the extremists' online approach as combining a message of religious obligation to defend Muslim causes with emotional international images in a way that attempts to provide a sense of purpose to disaffected youth. He encouraged Muslim communities to create online media content that acknowledges perceived grievances, but uses imagery and religious content to make clear that terrorists are actually killing Muslims, damaging Muslim causes, and violating Islam, not defending it. Efforts on protecting religious minorities and combating anti-Semitism Hussain has worked on efforts to improve the protection of Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities living in Muslim-majority countries. He has also sought to combat anti-Semitism by denouncing Holocaust denial and the publication of anti- Semitic materials in the Muslim world. In an op-ed on addressing anti-Semitism in the Muslim world, he condemned the broadcast of an anti-Semitic film aired in some Muslim-majority countries, arguing that Jews and Christians face discrimination and violence in these countries and that \\"Efforts must be made to ensure that textbooks and television programming in the Muslim world are free from the types of dehumanizing ideas and images that breed intolerance and hate.\\" Speaking to Foreign Ministers of Muslim countries at the OIC Ministerial in Guinea in 2013, he also criticized \\"restrictions on places of worship, including churches and synagogues\\" as \\"unacceptable.\\" He has also condemned blasphemy laws on other restrictions on speech that are used to persecute religious minorities, including Coptic Christians in Egypt, where he visited with an American Coptic leader in 2012. Hussain has also traveled to a number of countries to address persecution of Muslim communities, including the Central African Republic, Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, China, India, the Rohingya population from Myanmar, and a number of European nations. In May 2013, Hussain and the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism traveled with imams from around the world to Holocaust sites in Auschwitz- Birkenau as part of Hussain's \\"efforts to combat Holocaust denial and to address discrimination against religious minorities.\\" He also took a similar trip with American imams to Holocaust sites in 2010. Hussain has been outspoken against anti-Semitism during his other travels, including his rebuttal of anti-Semitic tirade during a trip to India in 2010. ADL President Abraham Foxman noted that Hussain's condemnation of \\"anti-Semitism in the Muslim and Arab world is significant\\" and that \\"influential figures, particularly political and religious leaders in the Muslim and Arab world, should emulate Ambassador Hussain's example.\\" In January 2013, Mr. Hussain received the Distinguished Honor Award from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which is given for \\"exceptionally outstanding service to the agencies of the U.S. Government resulting in achievements of marked national or international significance.\\" Works *\\"Protecting the Rights of Christians and Religious Minorities in the Muslim World\\" *\\"A Strategy for Countering Terrorist Propaganda in the Digital Age\\" * \\"Reformulating the Battle of Ideas: The Role of Islam in Counterterrorism Policy\\" Brookings Institution (2008) * \\"Countering Violent Extremism and Terrorist Recruiting in the Digital Age\\" * \\"Why the United States Cannot Agree to Disagree on Blasphemy laws\\"; Boston University International Law Journal (2014) *\\"Security with Transparency: Judicial Review in \\"Special Interest\\" Immigration Proceedings; Yale Law Journal113 Yale L.J. 1333 (2004) *\\"Costs of Post-9/11 National Security Strategy, The\\" *\\"Countering anti-Semitism in the Month of Ramadan\\" References External links * Rashad Hussain, Office of White House Counsel, WhiteHouse.Gov. * President Obama Announces Rashad Hussain as Special Envoy, WhiteHouse.Gov. * Introducing Rashad Hussain, WhiteHouse.Gov.

Pull-outs tend to meet one to two hours per week.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., Re-forming Gifted Education (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 219. The students meet with a teacher to engage in enrichment or extension activities that may or may not be related to the curriculum being taught in the regular classroom. Pull-out teachers in some states are not required to have any formal background in gifted education.http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/StatePolicy.aspx Criticism Research has suggested that there are benefits to grouping gifted children together for the majority of the school day,Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. xiii. which suggests that the limited meeting times and durations of gifted pull-out groups may have limited benefits for the gifted children. A 1993 U.S. Government report found up to 72% of school districts using the pull-out approach despite this method being generally unsuccessful.\\"Part II. The Current Status of Education for the Nation's Most Talented Students,\\" in National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent (online). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1993 This lack of effectiveness has been echoed in more recent literature.Davidson, Jan and Bob, with Vanderkam, Laura (Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, NY, NY, 2004) Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds, p. 67. Likewise, Borland (2003) concludes that pull-out programming is generally unproductive.Borland, James, ed., \\"The Death of Giftedness\\", Rethinking Gifted Education (New York: Teachers College Press, 2003). Specifically, this is because pull-outs are composed of a hodge-podge of critical thinking, logic puzzles, and random subjects (like mythology) which are unlikely to result in any significant academic progress because they are not tied directly to the core curriculum.Rogers, Re-forming..., p. 221. Winebrenner (2001) recommends those same ineffective practices, including creative problem solving, chess, logic puzzles, and academic competitions.Winebrenner, Susan, Teaching Gifted Kids in the Regular Classroom (Free Spirit Publishing, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, 2001), p. 196. Oddly, Winebrenner also recommends that students selected for pull-out should be those who are capable in the areas the pull-out will address.Winebrenner, p. 195. This is exactly the opposite of the approach recommended by most gifted literature, which argues for matching the instruction to the student, not vice versa. Jan and Bob Davidson of the Davidson Institute for Talent Development criticize pull-outs in their book, Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds. On page 47, they say, \\"Most pull-out programs provide little beyond a creative outlet--and since districts that offer such programs claim they are helping gifted children when they aren't, they are often worse than no programs at all.\\" Matthews and Foster also criticize pull-out gifted classes. They claim that the learning needs of advanced students are too important to be restricted to the day(s) on which their gifted class is scheduled. Furthermore, as they also point out, students can be penalized for missing their regular class (for example, by missing a class field trip), and sometimes teachers resent the pull-out teacher taking the strongest students out of their class. And perhaps most worrisome, the work in withdrawal gifted classes is often not differentiated for learning needs or properly integrated into children‚Äôs other studies.Matthews, D. and Foster, J. (2009). Being Smart about Gifted Education. However, pull-out programs, when properly implemented, can be used to complement cluster groupingWinebrenner, Susan, and Devlin, Barbara, Cluster Grouping Fact Sheet: How to Provide Full-Time Services for Gifted Students on Limited Budgets and other in-class differentiation. Success Factors/Recommendations * The content covered in gifted pull-outs should be academically beyond the ability of the students' regular classmates. If other students could do the work, they should be allowed to participate.Winebrenner, p. 194. * The regular class should be informed that pull-out participation does not make another student a better person. Similarly, participants should be discouraged from bragging.Winebrenner, p. 195. * Regular classroom teachers should not schedule tests, special events, or new topics during the pull- out.Rogers, Re-forming..., p. 220. Pull-out students can prove their mastery of the regular classroom material by answering a small subset of the problems containing the most challenging material.Winebrenner, p. 195. * A single, larger block of time is preferable to two or more smaller blocks.Winebrenner, p. 195. * The gifted specialist needs time to communicate with other teachers to map the extension and enrichment work to the core curriculum.Cox, J., Daniel, N., & Boston, B., (1985). Educating able learners: Programs and promising practices. Austin, TX: University of Texas Research shows that such systematic extension can result in substantial academic gains.Vaughn, V.L., Feldhusen, J.F., & Asher, J.W. (1991). Meta-analyses and review of research on pull-out programs in gifted education. Gifted Child Quarterly, 35, pp. 92-98. Similar gains in critical and creative thinking can be made in annual programs for those topics.Vaughn et al. * A 90-minute one-size-fits-all solution for every gifted child is inappropriate. Pull-outs must be part of a larger context including in-class differentiation, independent study, subject and whole-grade acceleration (grade skipping), distance learning, dual enrollment, AP courses, and mentorship.Davidsons, pp. 164-165. The gifted specialist should work with the regular classroom teacher to design these accommodations.Winebrenner, p. 195. * Pull-outs should encourage struggling to learn, facing challenges, and learning from mistakes,Winebrenner, p. 195. * Assigning pull-out homework is advantageous.Winebrenner, p. 195. * Pull-outs are an effective venue for working on social and emotional issues and interpersonal skill deficits encountered by gifted children.Winebrenner, p. 195. * Pull-outs are generally more successful in elementary school because middle and high school scheduling becomes problematic and the higher grades typically offer more options for advanced work and extracurriculars than the lower grades.Rogers, Re-forming..., p. 223. Difficulties * Pull-outs may be perceived erroneously by parents, teachers, and administrators as the entire solution to gifted education, while they should actually play a supplementary role to daily differentiated work in the regular classroom.Rogers, Re-forming..., p. 221. * Children are often expected to make up work that was missed during pull-out,Cox, et al. which frequently is not challenging to them to begin with. * Communication with the regular classroom teacher can break down.Cox, et al. * Regular educators may resent the specialist and the program.Cox, et al. * The pull-out curriculum may be viewed as fluff,Cox, et al. perhaps justifiably so. * Regular educators may resent the missing of important classwork.Cox, et al. * Regular educators may feel that they could teach the gifted children as well as the specialist.Cox, et al.

The film also co-stars Angela Yu Chien, Tien Feng and David Chiang. Lau Kar-leung served as action director for the film. Plot The late King of the Martial World has written a coveted manual which details his skills which can turn the practitioner into a supreme fighter. Knowing his two disciples would be deadly rivals, he separated the manual into two parts: one with odd-numbered pages and the other with even number pages. The Yin family possesses the odd-numbered page manual while the Winged Tiger, Teng Fei (Cheng Lui), has the even-number paged manual. Master Yin (Tien Feng), the King of Hades, wants the entire manual and arranges his younger sister, Yin Cai-fa (Angela Yu Chien), to marry the Winged Tiger in order to obtain the other manual. The chief of Mount Hua (Cheng Lui) and the leaders of Eight Schools sends famed martial artist, Flying Hero Guo Jiou-ru (Chan Hung-lit), who is proficient in ventriloquism and possesses comparable skills to Teng, to impersonate him and infiltrate the Yin household to steal away the other manual in order to prevent Yin from boosting his skills for evil doings. Guo arrives at the Peaceful Tavern and orders a room next to Teng where he eavesdrop on Teng's conversation with his assistant, the Soul-Sucking Lad (Wong Kin-wah), on his plan to pretend to fall for Cai-fa and requests Yin for the marriage with Cai-fa before he can learn the manual, as Teng is also after Yin's half of the manual. The next day, while on his way to the Yin Forest, Teng is attacked by martial artists who are after his manual, but he manages to kill all of them. Guo, who is disguised as Teng, is also attacked by a group of martial artists who are after Teng's manual. Teng happens to pass by during this time and joins Guo in the fight where they kill all of the martial artists. Afterwards, Teng asks Guo of his identity and the Soul-Sucking Lad and informs Teng of Guo's identity and his mission. Guo fights with Teng and the Soul-Sucking Lad and kills both of them and obtains Teng's manual. Master Liu Yi-ying (Fang Mian) and her daughter, Yan-qing (Annette Sam) arrives to bring a letter from the Right Schools to Guo suggesting him to destroy the manual to minimize his danger once he reaches the Yin Forest. Guo refuses to do so since he wants to obtain the full manual to spread its teachings to the martial world and rips off a couple pages of the manual and gives it to Yan-qing in cases he dies in his mission, Yin would not be able to obtain the complete manual. In return, Yan-qing gives Guo a mini sword which once impaled, the wound can only be treated by Master Liu. Guo arrives at the Yin Forest where he meets Yin, You Ming (Paul Wei) and the Three Officers, Jade Face Bai Yun-sheng (David Chiang), Iron Hand Zhao Bi (Luo Han) and Golden Face Liu Kun (Tong Tin-hei). Guo presents Yin with his part of the manual before speaking privately to You Ming, who is colluding with Teng to obtain Yin's part of the manual, although You Ming suspects Guo of his identity. At this time, the Three Officers also schemes to have Guo killed to take his manual and obtain Yin's manual as well. Cai-fa, who is unhappy about her marriage with Teng, instantly changes her mind after she sees Guo in person and is smitten with him. Guo then stealths around the Yin mansion and kills several guards while Yan-qing also sneaks in to the Yin Forest to give a message to Guo. In the meantime, Teng's body was also discovered by Yin's lieutenant, Zhang Piao (Yeung Chsk-lam) and was brought into the Yin Forest where You Ming suspects Guo may be impersonating Teng. Since Teng flies with his wings while Guo jumps with the power of his feet stepping on each other, You Ming suggests Yin to test Guo's martial arts to see whether he knows Teng's signature killing technique. Guo then fights and kills a couple of Yin's henchman with Teng's signature killing technique and wins Yin's trust while also handing his part of the manual to Yin. You Ming, however, is still suspicious of Guo's identity and suggests Yin to lure Guo to the steal the manual by telling Cai-fa to inform Guo where the manual is hidden. Guo secretly follows Yin, Cai-fa and You Ming when they hide the manual inside a tripod inside a cave. When Cai-fa returns to the mansion, Guo fakes s conversation with a shadow mannequin of You Ming where he pretends to tell You Ming that he is no longer interested in the manual since he was fallen in love with Cai-fa and wants to marry her. Guo and Cai-fa make love and Cai-fa reveals Yin and You Ming's plan to him about testing his sincerity. At this time, Yan-qing had also snuck into the Yin mansion and unhappy of Guo and Cai- fa's relationship, Guo explains to her about pretending to be in love with Cai-fa, who overhead their conversation. Cai-fa informs her brother of Guo's identity and ambushes Guo. After an extended fight with Yin's guards, Guo was heavily injured and flies away where he then hides in Cai-fa's room. Despite his betrayal, Cai-fa is still very much in love with Guo and nurse him back to health and Guo reveals to her his true intention of obtaining the full manual and spread its teachings to the martial world and that they can be together after he succeeds but she is not completely convinced. Cai-fa ties Guo up but he escapes by burning the rope with a candle when Cai-fa fell asleep and goes to the cave to steal the manual. However, the tripod turns out empty and Yin traps Guo inside the cave. Cai-fa then arrives to attack Guo with enticing bombs which are really duds as she actually helps him escape and fend of Yin's thugs, but Guo accidentally impales her with the sword given to him by Yan- qing. Cai-fa tells Guo she does not hate him for using her and would rather him pretend to love her until the very end while Guo also deduces he has fallen into You Ming's trap of using him to steal the manual. You Ming also arrives at this time and Guo fights and kills him before fighting and killing the Three Officers. Guo then attempts to flee with Cai-fa was stopped by Zhang and more guards and kills them before Yin arrives and fights with Guo where Yin gains the upper hand when he wraps his whip around Guo's neck. In order to save him, Cai-fa asks Guo to give Yin the manual and it is revealed Yin never hid the manual in the cave and wanted to pages that Guo ripped off from the odd-numbered manual. Cai-fa then pulls out the sword impaled in her and cuts off Yin's whip and Guo kills Yin. Cai-fa dies from her would and Guo carries her dead body to Mount Hua.

He was an active and prolific translator, and was fluent in Czech, Russian, Serbo- Croatian, Hungarian, Romanian, French, Italian, German, and Dutch. He died on September 29, 2012, of complications from melanoma. Biography Heim was born in Manhattan, New York City on January 21, 1943. His father, Imre Hajdu, was Hungarian, born in Budapest; before moving to the US in 1939, he had been a music composer and master baker. In New York, Imre was introduced as a piano teacher to Blanche, Heim's mother, whom he married shortly thereafter. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Imre joined the US Army. At the time of Heim's birth, Imre was stationed in Alabama. Heim's father died when he was four, and he was raised by his mother and step-father in Staten Island. In 1966, he was drafted into the US Army during the Vietnam War. When it was discovered that he was the sole surviving son of a soldier who had died in service, he was relieved from the draft. During the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Heim was in Prague employed as translator by UNESCO. When the tanks rolled into Prague, he was in the unique position of being able to translate between Czech and Russian, thereby facilitating communications between the Soviet soldiers and the Czechoslovaks on the streets. With his knowledge of German, he was also able to assist a West German television crew in navigating the occupied city and interviewing ordinary Czech citizens, and to warn potential victims that Soviet agents were looking for them. He was married for thirty-seven years to his wife, Priscilla Smith Kerr, who brought three children of her own, Rebecca, Jocelyn and Michael, into the family from a previous marriage. He died on September 29, 2012 of complications from melanoma. Education Heim graduated from Curtis High School on Staten Island, where he studied French and German. He double-majored in Oriental Civilization and Russian Language and Literature, studying Chinese and Russian at Columbia University as an undergraduate, and worked with Gregory Rabassa, an acclaimed translator. As an American citizen, he had no chance of visiting China after his graduation, so he decided to concentrate on Russian at the postgraduate level. He received his PhD in Slavic Languages from Harvard University in 1971, under the mentorship of Roman Jakobson. Career Heim was one of the finest and most prolific translators of his age. He was also for nearly 40 years a faculty member of the UCLA Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, being promoted prior to his death to UCLA Distinguished Professor. Every two years, Heim taught a workshop in literary translation at UCLA's Department of Comparative Literature, which was highly regarded by his students. Heim served as editor of a translation series published by Northwestern University Press, and was several times a juror for the National Endowment for the Humanities. After Heim's death, it was revealed with his wife's permission that he was the secret donor behind the PEN Translation Fund, which was set up in 2003 with his gift of $730,000. Awards and recognition Heim garnered unusually wide recognition for his translations, and was considered one of the foremost literary translators of the late twentieth century. He won the 2005 Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator's Prize for German-to-English translation of Thomas Mann‚Äôs Death in Venice (Der Tod in Venedig). He received the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation in 2009. In 2010, he received the PEN Translation Prize for his translation from the Dutch of Wonder (De verwondering, 1962) by Hugo Claus. The same book was also short-listed for Three Percent's Best Translated Book Award. Besides his celebrated translations, Heim was lauded for his research on 18th-century Russian writers and their philosophies of translation, at a time 'when the process of literary creation occurred largely through the prism of translation'. Heim was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002, and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2006. Published work Translations List taken from Heim's UCLA Faculty page.

History The order was created in January 1862 by Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. With the obsolescence of the Ni≈üan-i Iftikhar, this became the second highest order in the Empire, ranking below the Ni≈üan-i Imtiyaz. It was awarded by the Sultan to Ottoman civil servants and military leaders for outstanding services to the state. Generally, it could not be awarded to women, but exceptions appear to have been made at the Sultan's discretion. The order was originally established in three classes. In 1867 the order was expanded to four classes, plus an augmented first class set with brilliants or diamonds (This does not include the awards with sabers, which were not separate classes, but did constitute separate awards). The order was restricted (for Turkish recipients) to 50 members of the first class, 200 members of the second class, 1000 of the third class, and 2000 of the fourth class. Originally, one could not receive the first class of this order without having first been decorated with the First Class of the Order of the Medjidie, but during the 33-year reign of Abdulhamid II, most of these restrictions were ignored and the first class of both orders were awarded liberally. A fifth class was added in 1893. From 1915 until the end of the First World War, all classes could be awarded with sabers when awarded for achievements in military operations. Badge of the Order Description The badge of the order is a seven pointed star in dark green enamel, with three short silver rays between each point of the star. The center medallion is in gold, with a red enameled field surrounded by a green enameled band. In the red central portion is a raised gold crescent, and a calligraphic inscription reading \\"Relying on the Assistance of Almighty God, Abdulaziz Khan, Sovereign of the Ottoman Empire\\". The reverse center medallion is silver, bearing a trophy of arms and the year AH. 699, the year of the creation of the Ottoman Empire. The badge is suspended by a gold crescent and star, facing upwards. The star of the order bears the same obverse center medallion superimposed on a silver seven pointed star of faceted rays. A star of the first class typically measures about 100 mm, while that of the second class measures about 90 mm across, with the Ottoman mint mark on the reverse.

Tidal Basin, about 125 feet south of what is now Independence Avenue, SW. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the first lady presented a bouquet of \\"American Beauty\\" roses to Viscountess Chinda. Washington's renowned National Cherry Blossom Festival grew from this simple ceremony, witnessed by just a few persons. These two original trees still stand several hundred yards west of the John Paul Jones Memorial, located at the terminus of 17th Street, SW. Situated near the bases of the trees is a large bronze plaque which commemorates the occasion. This gift was officially seen as coming from the capital city of Japan, Tokyo, to the capital city of the United States, Washington, D.C. The illustrated biography The Art of Peace presents Prince Iyesato Tokugawa and his Japanese allies‚Äô pivotal involvement in bringing about the gifting of these cherry blossom trees as a means of promoting international goodwill.

His grandfather, Hayashi Yasusada (also known as \\"Hayashi Gonsuke\\") was a noted samurai leader in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, but fighting for the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1867, his grandfather and father were both killed in combat during the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi, leaving the seven-year-old Gonsuke as head of the Hayashi household. Despite his youth, he was given a military rank and assigned to a position in the defense of Aizuwakamatsu Castle during the Battle of Aizu. After the defeat of the Aizu forces and the establishment of the Meiji government, Hayashi, along with many surviving members of the Aizu clan, were sent to the newly created Tonami Domain in what is now northern Aomori Prefecture. However, after a period in northern Japan, he caught the attention of an officer from Satsuma Domain, Kodama Sanefumi, who had known his grandfather in Kyoto from the days of the K≈çbu gattai movement, and Kodama brought the young Hayashi and his mother to live in Tokyo. Kodama subsequently died during the Satsuma Rebellion. Hayashi graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and obtained a position at the Foreign Ministry in 1887. After serving as Consul to the Japanese diplomatic missions at Chemulpo, Korea and Shanghai, China, he served as secretary at the Japanese embassies in London and Beijing. While in China, he helped Liang Qichao escape to exile in Japan after the Conservative Coup ended the Hundred Days' Reform.

He also directed the specially-commissioned music for the 1951 revival of the York Mystery Plays, regarded as the greatest event in the Festival of Britain celebrations. Career The son of a parson, Wicks began his musical studies as a pianist at an early age, but did not think that he would be good enough to become professional. He was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and at the age of 14 he was advised to convert to the organ. He took his degree at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was also organ scholar at the cathedral, assistant to Thomas Armstrong. Completing his studies after serving in the 14th Punjab Regiment, gaining an MA and an FRCO, he then took up post at York Minster in 1947, as sub-organist to Francis Jackson. He described his time at York as being much easier than modern cathedral organists: \\"In those days it was easier to manage on one's own, because we never used to conduct, except a cappella pieces, we never conducted like cathedral organists now who hardly ever play the organ, they're down there wagging a finger, waving their arms about.\\" Whilst based in York, he was on the music staff at St Peter's School and Chorus Master of Leeds Philharmonic Society. For the 1951 revival of the York Mystery Plays he was director of the music, composed by his friend James Brown. The plays captured the hearts of the British public, and have been performed regularly ever since.Harris, Richard, York Mystery Plays musician and York Minster organist Allan Wicks has died, York Press, 11 February 2010.

Wicks also championed Maxwell Davies's Fantasia on O Magnum Mysterium, as well as Malcolm Williamson's six-movement Symphony. He also organised a Cantata Choir and a small orchestra for Tuesday evening concerts of larger-scale works, including Igor Stravinsky's Canticum Sacrum and Messiaen's Messe de la Pentec√¥te. In 1961 he was appointed organist and master of the choristers of Canterbury Cathedral, where he served for 27 years, under three Archbishops, retiring after being appointed C.B.E. in 1988.

Upon formation it consisted of three infantry battalions‚Äîthe 2/21st, 2/22nd and 2/40th Battalions‚Äîalthough later both a pioneer (initially, the 2/3rd but then later the 2/4th) and a machine gun battalion (the 2/4th) were added to its establishment. These units were drawn from Victoria and Tasmania. The brigade's first commander was Brigadier Edmund Lind. In August 1940, the brigade concentrated around Bonegilla. When the 8th Division was sent to Malaya in early 1941, the 23rd Brigade remained in Australia. In March and April 1941, it deployed to Darwin until Japanese intentions became clearer. Nevertheless, ultimately its subunits experienced the same fate that befell the rest of the division. Broken up and sent piecemeal to reinforce the garrisons at Rabaul, Ambon and on Timor, the 2/21st, 2/22nd and 2/40th Battalions were all eventually destroyed or captured by the Japanese in early 1942. Outnumbered and lacking sufficient air and artillery support, these units were quickly overwhelmed. While some members were able to evade capture and eventually rejoined Australian forces in New Guinea, most were captured. Many died in Japanese captivity. The 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion was also hastily deployed, reinforcing the 8th Division in Singapore where it too was eventually captured. A 27th Battalion mortar team during a training exercise in December 1944 While its constituent battalions were deployed, the brigade's headquarters remained intact in Darwin, and consequently it was reinforced with replacement units from the Militia, beginning in December 1941. The brigade's constituent units initially included the 43rd Battalion and the 27th Battalion, while the 19th Machine Gun Regiment arrived to replace the 2/4th in January 1942. In March 1942, Brigadier Ivan Dougherty assumed command of the brigade which was assigned to the 12th Division (Northern Territory Force). Later, the 8th Battalion was also assigned to the 23rd Brigade. Having been responsible for the forward defensive area around Darwin initially, in March 1942, the brigade re-deployed to Brookings Creek when the 3rd Brigade arrived, occupying a defensive position in depth. At this time it was assigned a US artillery regiment‚Äîthe 147th‚Äîin support, and consisted of the 7th, 8th and 43rd Battalions. A reorganisation in mid-1942 saw the brigade move to Howard Springs, Northern Territory. Throughout 1942 and 1943, the brigade remained in the Northern Territory, undertaking defensive duties. There were several moves during this time, and the brigade's assigned units varied. In September 1943, the 23rd Brigade was relieved by the 12th. Brigade headquarters, along with the 7th and 8th Battalions were redeployed to Watsonia, Victoria, and then sent to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where the 27th Battalion rejoined the brigade. There, the 23rd formed part of the 3rd Division and undertook training prior to deployment overseas. In April 1944, the brigade deployed to Lae, in New Guinea, where they were assigned to the 11th Division. Training was undertaken at Bulolo, before the brigade was reassigned to the 3rd Division in July. Later in the year, under the command of Brigadier Arnold Potts, the brigade took part in the Bougainville campaign as part of II Corps. Initially, they were used in a static role, garrisoning the Outer Islands, which they took control of from the US 93rd Infantry Division; at this time the 27th Battalion and brigade headquarters was deployed to Green Island, the 8th was on Emirau and the 7th was on Stirling Island and at Munda. However, in April 1945 the brigade was committed to the fighting on Bougainville Island, where they took over responsibility for the central and northern sectors, engaging the Japanese in direct combat for the first time, carrying out patrolling operations and launching a number of small attacks. During one of these attacks, north of Ratsua, one of the 8th Battalion's members, Private Frank Partridge, performed the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Following the end of hostilities, the brigade remained on Bougainville guarding Japanese prisoners as the demobilisation process began. Finally, in 1946 all its subordinate units were disbanded. In November 1945, command of the brigade transferred to Brigadier Noel Simpson. By January 1946, the brigade headquarters was located around Torokina, before moving to Fauro Island the following month. In early April, the brigade returned to Australia aboard HMAS Kanimbla, arriving in Sydney, where its constituent units returned to their states of origin, while the brigade's cadre personnel returned to Watsonia for disbandment. The brigade headquarters' final entry in its war diary was made in early May 1946.

The tradition of theater in Mason County dates back to at least 1797 according to the Washington, Kentucky newspaper, The Mirror. The performance at the \\"Court House\\" is the first record of a stage performance west of the Alleghenies to disclose play titles, performance dates and prices. By 1817, there was a theater in Limestone (Maysville) at the corner of 2nd Street and Fish Street (now Wall Street). A disastrous fire destroyed a significant amount of property on West Second Street in April 1850 including the Presbyterian Church, then known as the Old Blue Church. The church congregation decided to rebuild on Third Street, leaving the Second Street lot vacant. In 1851, two fire companies were formed to prevent a repeat of the town fire and an elegant theater, \\"The Opera House\\", was built on the site of the Old Blue Church. In 1898, fire struck again and \\"The Opera House\\" was destroyed. Perhaps from remorse, the Washington Fire Company, organized at the time the theater was built - nearly five decades before, decided to rebuild it at a cost of $24,000 and the new structure was thereafter known as the \\"Washington Opera House\\". A number of famous artists and actors performed here including Marguerite Clark, Tom Mix, John L. Sullivan, and John Philip Sousa and his band.

It used a \\"cold swaging\\" technique to create sewing machine needles and other needles from cold metal, and was the largest employer in Torrington. in addition to its main facilities in Torrington, it acquired a division, located in South Bend, Indiana.On the mark‚Ä¶with bearings for missiles. // Aviation Week & Space Technology, May 4, 1959, v. 70, no. 18, p. 82. Later as a leading manufacturer of anti-friction bearings and a Fortune 500 company, The Torrington Company sold its products, which also included an array of metal parts and assemblies, to a variety of major global industries. Company Overview Originally a sewing needle manufacturer, Torrington diversified and grew over the years, becoming a discernibly different company with each passing decade. During the 1930s, the company diversified into anti-friction bearings and from that point forward evolved into the formidable force it represented during the 1990s. In 1968 the management sold the company to Ingersoll Rand. It was later purchased in 2003 by the Timken Company. The Timken company utilized its Heavy Bearing plants and later Needle Bearing plants along with Torrington brand name was sold to JTEKT in 2009. Company History In the nineteenth-century Connecticut was home to several inventive \\"Nutmeggers,\\" including Samuel Colt, who developed the first revolver, Eli Whitney, whose invention of the cotton gin revolutionized the cotton industry, and Elias Howe, a transplanted \\"Nutmegger\\" from neighboring Massachusetts who made his life's discovery in New Hartford, Connecticut, where he recorded the first of two landmark achievements that would launch the predecessor to The Torrington Company into business. In 1846, Elias Howe designed an early version of the sewing machine. Howe's invention represented a historic advancement in technology to be sure, but there were critical problems with his new machine that made its usefulness not quite the labor-saving device it purported to be. The chief problem with Howe's machine was the ineffectiveness of the needles it employed; Howe, in essence, had created a razor without the blades. In the years following his discovery, the sewing needles that existed were imprecise pins of steel hammered out essentially the same way a blacksmith formed a horseshoe. It was a crude method that produced imperfect results, frequently leaving the purchasers of Howe's machine with broken needles they had pounded out by hand. Twenty years would pass before a suitable solution was found. The solution arrived‚Äîat first unbeknownst to its creators‚Äîin 1864, when another transplanted \\"Nutmegger,\\" a former Vermont toolmaker, Orrin L. Hopson, and his associate, Herman P. Brooks, made their own pivotal discovery in Waterbury, Connecticut. Hopson and Brooks developed and patented a machine that year described as \\"An Improvement in Pointing Wire for Pins,\\" which perhaps was as specific a use for the machine as the two inventors had in mind. Their machine could compress a section of steel but for what purpose and to whose interest, they were unclear. The two designers of the wire-compressing machine decided to leave Waterbury to find a market for their invention. Hopson and Brooks, who reacted to their discovery with a decided entrepreneurial bent, had settled by 1866 in Wolcottville, Connecticut, by which time they had determined that the marketability of their invention was not the machine itself but the products it could manufacture: sewing machine needle blanks. Excelsior Needle Company In Wolcottville, the central part of the city of Torrington, which had been for years a hub of numerous light-manufacturing activities, Hopson and Brooks convinced seven local businessmen that their machine could produce sewing machine needle blanks superior to those already in existence. A company called Excelsior Needle Company was organized in February 1866 to create a manufacturing concern inspired by Hopson's and Brooks' machine and what it could produce. Hopson and Brooks received 100 of the 800 shares composing Excelsior Needle stock, relinquished their patent rights for $5,000, and left the realization of their invention's potential in the hands of Achille F. Migeon, Excelsior Needle's president, and Charles Alvord, the company's secretary and treasurer. Migeon and Alvord wasted no time in getting the business started, obtaining a two-story, 16-room building for $3,000 six days after they were elected to their posts. The wood framed structure became Excelsior Needle's first factory. By 1868, two years after beginning business, Excelsior Needle had produced enough sewing needles to begin selling them to sewing machine manufacturers, the largest of which was the Singer Company. Two years later, when roughly 700,000 sewing machines were being manufactured each year, fueling demand for Excelsior Needle's products, the fledgling manufacturing concern had sold enough needle blanks to warrant the relocation of its operations to larger quarters closer to rail transportation. By the mid-1870s, Excelsior Needle was churning out 30,000 sewing needles a day, six days a week, and generating approximately $75,000 a year in sales. Soon thereafter, the company's sales volume rose even further above that level. The solid foundation Excelsior Needle had established during its first decade‚Äîby helping to create a new American industry‚Äîprovided a stable springboard for growth that carried the company through the 1880s and toward its first defining decade. During the 1890s, Excelsior Needle diversified its business line, expanded its business overseas, and established the first of many acquisitions. Perhaps the most notable change that occurred during the decade was a symbolic one‚Äîthe first link to The Torrington Company. In 1890, before Torrington entered the scene, Excelsior Needle absorbed Springfield, Massachusetts-based National Needle Company, a competing needle manufacturer that had first opened its doors 18 years earlier, in 1873. The addition of National Needle's assets and its 175 employees occurred during the same year that Excelsior Needle located to a larger factory for the second time to provide for the company's burgeoning growth. Growth was the dominant theme during the decade, engendering a more well-rounded and financially sound company. As the 1890s progressed, Excelsior Needle diversified into a number of new areas, including the manufacture of knitting machine latch needles and the manufacture of heavy hook needles used in the mass production of shoes and other leather goods. Excelsior Needle continued to diversify, forming a subsidiary named Torrington Swaging Company, to manufacture spokes for bicycle wheels. (This was in response to a new feature of the sewing machine industry that took shape during the 1890s: Sewing machine manufacturers, led by the Singer Company, had begun to manufacture bicycles in increasing numbers.) Excelsior Needle also acquired controlling interest in two sales organizations‚ÄîBoston-based S.M. Supplies Company and New York City-based C.B. Barker & Company‚Äîand moved beyond U.S. borders for the first time with the establishment of American Supplies Company in England. Near the turn of the century, the steady growth during the 1880s and the multifarious outbursts of diversification and expansion during the 1890s had combined to create a prodigious manufacturing force with annual sales amounting to $768,000 by 1898. Much had transpired during the company's first 30 years of business: It had evolved from a small entrepreneurial company that manufactured sewing machine needle blanks to a diversified manufacturing concern which, by the century's conclusion, derived only 25 percent of its sales from the production of sewing needles. The Torrington Company Much, however, remained to be accomplished. Migeon and Alvord, still heading the company after three decades, looked to expand further, but the two executors of Excelsior Needle determined that the scope of their operations exceeded the financial clout of their local community. In pursuit of capital then, all the assets of Excelsior Needle were transferred in 1898 to The Torrington Company of Maine, organized two days prior to the transfer for just that purpose. Excelsior Needle acted as the operating company of its parent company, The Torrington Company of Maine, until 1917, when the directors of both companies decided to form a single corporate entity, The Torrington Company of Connecticut. Federal tax laws, however, stipulated that the exchange would result in the payment of capital gains tax, something the directors of the company wished to avoid, so for the next 19 years there were two Torringtons‚ÄîThe Torrington Company of Maine, which acted as a holding company for the second company, and The Torrington Company of Connecticut. Excelsior Needle, meanwhile, disappeared as a distinct corporate entity, continuing on merely as the \\"Excelsior Plant.\\" During the two decades bridging the formation of The Torrington Company of Connecticut in 1917 and its dissolution in 1936 when The Torrington Company of Maine absorbed its assets, the diversified manufacturing concern grew in stature, recording notable successes and a share of failures during an era pocked by global conflict. World War I brought Torrington into a new business line when the government requested that the well-known needle manufacturing concern begin producing surgical needles, a complex product to manufacture that Torrington had little interest and no experience in making. Before the war, Europe, particularly England, had been the primary source for surgical needles for the United States, but when World War II broke out, the supply of surgical needles into the United States slowed to a trickle. Torrington compensated for the precipitous drop in surgical needle imports, but only at the government's request. Spark plugs and marine engines, shipped to Torrington's subsidiary in England, and the production of 75 millimeter shells were also included in the company's war-time contributions, but unlike many other manufacturing concerns, Torrington was able to conduct business on a fairly normal level throughout the war, emerging from the war years as strong, if not stronger, than it had entered them. After the war, Torrington recorded its first debilitative blunder during the 1920s when it began selling electrically powered vacuum cleaners. This debacle of the decade was offset by rousing success in producing wheel spokes for automobile wire wheels. By the 1930s, the Great Depression had created a need for Torrington to search for new business, the pursuit of which led to the most defining moment in the company's history. The epiphany that forever changed Torrington's future and the answer to the company's need for new business had roots stretching back 20 years earlier, back to 1912, when Torrington had acquired a small ball bearing business through an affiliation with an automobile ignition coil and spark plug manufacturer. Initially Torrington's ball bearing business represented a relatively small and insignificant facet of the company's business, but by the mid-1920s it had evolved into a respectable-sized manufacturing operation that produced a wide range of bearings and provided the foundation for a new, larger segment of Torrington's business in the 1930s. Needle Roller Bearings The person charged with drumming up new business during the Depression was a research engineer named Edmund K. Brown. He developed a new type of bearing for the company‚Äîa needle bearing‚Äîthat eventually predicated the bulk of Torrington's business. On the heels of Brown's discovery came an important acquisition in 1935, when Torrington acquired the Bantam Ball Bearing Company. Brown's needle bearing and the addition of Bantam Ball Bearing signalled the beginning of a new era for Torrington, a future in which the production of bearings would fuel the company's growth and lift Torrington into the upper echelon of U.S. manufacturers. This new chapter in the history of Torrington began with a decided flourish during World War II when the company once again manufactured surgical needles to supply the nation's war- time needs. In contrast to World War I, however, Torrington invested considerable effort toward manufacturing its new line of products‚Äîbearings. Needle bearings were supplied to the government for a variety of purposes, especially for uses in military aircraft and in B-29 bombers in particular, giving the company's bearing business sufficient momentum to emerge during the postwar era as the driving force propelling the company's growth. During the two decades following the conclusion of World War II, Torrington's bearing business evolved into the company's mainstay product line, eclipsing the fabrication of needles as the company's primary source of revenue. By 1965, the sale of bearings accounted for more than 60 percent of Torrington's total sales, with needles, sold primarily to the textile and shoe industries, accounting for 30 percent of the company's sales volume. During that time, Torrington has developed many types of needle bearings for highly specialized combat aircraft and guided missile applications. Roller Bearings The U.S. bearing industry by this point was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti- friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer‚Äîa company that had earned the respect of competitors‚Äîand now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began to attract the attention of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern. The Torrington Company was the largest US producer of bicycle pedals from the late 1920s thru the early 1980s that utilized their bearing design, they were the exclusive supplier to Columbia Bicycles (Pope Manufacturing) made in Westfield MA and Schwinn line of bicycles made in Chicago. The pedals are named for their relative size Ex. Torrington 10, or Torrington 20 and are considered to be a durable and excellent design. Well maintained original and restored examples that are intended to be used in classic bicycle restoration can sell for several hundred dollars per pair. The designs have been copied and good quality Asian examples generally sell for between $10 to $50 per pair. Under Ingersoll-Rand (1968-2003) Against the backdrop of a nationwide trend of mergers and acquisitions, the directors of Torrington realized that refusing every bid offered for the company was implausible and, perhaps, imprudent. In 1968 then, Torrington's management settled on Ingersoll-Rand, a diversified manufacturer of machinery, tools, and construction equipment. Through an exchange of stock valued at over $200 million, Torrington became an autonomous subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand that year, embarking on its second century of business under the corporate umbrella of its parent. As an autonomous subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand, Torrington's second century began much as the first one had ended, with long-time Torrington officials presiding over the company's activities. New corporate headquarters were completed in 1970, marking the beginning of a decade that would see Torrington's financial performance sputter in the face of recessive economic conditions. Favorable developments came in the form of Torrington's involvement in the manufacture of steering column universal joints for the automotive industry and the continuing success of its needle bearing manufacturing business. Despite these developments, though, profits lagged throughout the decade, leading Ingersoll-Rand to exert its authority over Torrington for the first time by the decade's conclusion. Torrington's needle making business, an intrinsic and formative facet of the company's existence since its inception, was abandoned in 1980 after 114 years of contributing to the company's growth. Since the Ingersoll-Rand merger, Torrington's needle business had produced lackluster results and it was decided that both Torrington's and Ingersoll-Rand's future goals could best be accomplished without the business first launched by Migeon and Alvord. Merger with Fafnir Bearing Company Stripped of its needle business, Torrington entered the 1980s as primarily a bearing manufacturer, with needle bearings accounting for 49 percent of the company's sales and heavy bearings contributing another 30 percent. After several years of corporate restructuring, Torrington became a considerably larger bearing manufacturer when the company acquired Fafnir Bearing Company in 1985. Formed, like Torrington, in Connecticut, Fafnir had evolved into a leading bearing producer from its origination in 1911, becoming by the mid-1980s a precision ball bearing manufacturer serving the aerospace, machine tool, industrial, and agricultural industries with distinction. When the two bearing producers were combined in 1985, adding Fafnir's seven manufacturing facilities to Torrington's already numerous manufacturing facilities, the result was the largest bearing manufacturing company in North America and one of the largest in the world, with total sales amounting to roughly $750 million. The addition of Fafnir provided a powerful boost to Torrington's stature as a bearing manufacturer, coming in a decade during which the company also hailed the accomplishment of significant developmental work in ceramic and sensor bearings. These achievements helped reduce the sting of the lamented divestment of its needle business. By the end of the 1980s, however, Torrington's situation had once again soured, as U.S. competitors in the $3 billion bearing business railed against unfair foreign competition. Torrington was among the pack charging that Asian and European bearing producers were selling bearings below their manufacturing cost, an illegal practice that carried into the early 1990s. As Torrington sought to bring a favorable conclusion to the contentious legal debate addressing unfair trade practices, the company entered the mid-1990s as a stalwart industry leader. Part of Ingersoll-Rand's Bearings, Locks, and Tools business group, Torrington charted its future course beyond the mid-1990s, buoyed by its more than 125 years of successfully navigating through unseen waters. This legacy of success promised to serve the company well in the years to come, adding a rich history of experience to surmount whatever obstacles loomed in the future.Ingersoll Rand Time-line Under The Timken Company (2003-2009) Timken approaches Ingersoll-Rand to purchase the industrial side of Torrington's business but soon got interested in its entirety as it realized Torrington's automotive business was stronger than originally thought. It was purchased in 2003 by the Timken Company.The Timken Company Press Release Sold to JTEKT Corporation Needle bearing plants along with Torrington brand name were sold to JTEKT in 2009 by the Timken Company.

The grant encompassed present-day Paso Robles and Templeton. Dise√±o del Rancho Paso de Robles History The six square league Rancho Paso de Robles grant was made to Jos√© Pedro Narv√°ez, a Mexican naval officer, who served as captain of the port of Monterey from 1839 to 1844. Narv√°ez sold Rancho Paso de Robles to Petronilo R√≠os in 1845. Petronilo R√≠os (1806-1870) was a Mexican soldier who came to California in the mid-1820s. He married Catarina Avila (1812-1889) in 1832. In the 1830s R√≠os was shuttling between Monterey and Mission San Miguel Arc√°ngel where he was corporal commanding the mission guard. In 1835, with local Indian labor, he built the Rios-Caledonia Adobe. In 1839, he was promoted to commander of artillery at the presidio in Monterey, and retired from the military in 1840. In 1842 R√≠os obtained the Rancho San Bernabe land grant and moved his family there. In 1845 R√≠os moved his family from Rancho San Bernabe to Rancho Paso de Robles.Rose Marie Beebe and Robert M. Senkewicz, 2006, Testimonios: Early California through the Eyes of Women, 1815‚Äì1848, pp85-93, Heyday Books, In 1846 William Reed, Miguel Garcia, and Petronilo R√≠os bought the San Miguel rancho from P√≠o Pico. R√≠os and his family moved into the Rios- Caledonia Adobe in 1851. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Paso de Robles was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 351 SD and the grant was patented to Petronilo R√≠os in 1886. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 In 1857, R√≠os sold Rancho Paso de Robles and moved to Santa Clara. The entire rancho was purchased by James H. Blackburn, Daniel Drew Blackburn, natives of Virginia who came to California in 1849, and Lazard Godchaux. In 1860, the partners divided the rancho, with D.D. Blackburn taking one league of land including the hot springs. In 1865, D.D. Blackburn sold a half-interest to Drury W. James. D. W. James had come from Kentucky to California in 1849, and drove cattle from Santa Clara to the gold mines. Later he bought cattle as far south as Los Angeles. James stopped at the Paso Robles springs on a cattle-buying trip in 1851. J.H. Blackburn never married, but D. D. Blackburn and D. W. James married sisters, Celia and Louisa Dunn in 1866. After the death of J.H. Blackburn, there were many lawsuits brought by some of the D. D. Blackburn children for portions of the estate, which had been willed to Mrs. D. D.

The parish complex is located in downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States, at the corner of Fourth and Main Streets. It is the first church congregation organized in the city of Davenport and the second Catholic congregation, after St. Raphael's in Dubuque, in the state of Iowa. The parish buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church Complex in 1984. The designation includes the church and the former school building, which is the parish's original church building and the oldest standing church building in Iowa. The designation also included the rectory, which was partially torn down in 2009. The complex was also listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1992 as St. Anthony's Church Square. The property has been known historically as Church Square. In 2020 the parish buildings, except for the parish center, were included as contributing properties in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. Because of its recent construction date, the parish center is excluded as a contributing property. Development Antoine LeClaireRev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP In 1832, on what is now the city of Davenport, Chief Keokuk of the Sauk tribe signed a treaty with the United States government after the tribe's defeat in the Black Hawk War. The tribe ceded land on the west side of the Mississippi River, which was then opened to settlement. Antoine LeClaire, who was French- Pottawattamie and served as the translator at the treaty signing, received two parcels of land. The original section of the city was laid out in 1836. The next year an addition was made to the small town on one of LeClaire's parcels. He stipulated that a Catholic church be built on one of the squares. That same year a frontier missionary, the Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP, arrived in Davenport and started the parish. At that time there were 25 Catholics in a town of 100 people. It is the oldest church congregation in Davenport. Mazzuchelli drew up plans for a simple two-story structure that would serve as a church and priest's residence. He actually gave the parish two patron saints. St. Peter is the parish's primary patron, and St. Anthony of Padua is its secondary patron. However, the parish has always been known as St. Anthony's, the patron saint of its benefactor Antoine LeClaire. Ground was broken for the new church on April 27, 1838, and it was built by pioneer settlers Adam Noel, John Noel and Joseph Noel Antoine LeClaire, the First Proprietor of Davenport The Annals of Iowa 23(1941), 106-107 with assistance from Harvey Leonard for $2,000. The first bricks manufactured in the city of Davenport were used to build the church. Bishop Mathias Loras of Dubuque dedicated the new structure on May 23, 1839. The building served many purposes for the small community. It was a church, city hall, courthouse, schoolhouse, public forum, and gathering place for the citizens of the town. The church's bell called parishioners to Mass, children to school, sounded the alarm for a fire, as well as summoning the city's aldermen for their sessions. 1886 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map of Church Square. Note the church addition was not completed, and the commercial buildings on the east side of the square. The title to the property, named Church Square, was deeded to Bishop Loras in 1839 to support the Catholic Church in Davenport. Commercial properties were built on the east side of the block. Income from these properties was a factor in Davenport being named a see city with its own bishop in 1881. The church had a small choir which included Antoine LeClaire and Judge C.G.R. Mitchell, who would provide the land for the city's first Catholic cemetery and two of the churches in the city's west end. There was, however, no organ. Instead, music was led by a small ensemble made up of a violin, clarinet, flute, and cello. The parish's first pastor was a French missionary priest recruited by Bishop Loras, the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourgues, who arrived in Davenport in September 1839. He served the parish until 1868 when he remained in his native France while he was visiting there. Initially, Father Pelamourgues resided in a partitioned section of the gallery of the church. He was also responsible for more than the small parish in Davenport. He traveled to other Catholic communities in the region: Muscatine, Iowa City, Burlington, Columbus Junction, DeWitt and Lyons (the north side of present-day Clinton). Bishop Loras was also interested in evangelizing the Native Americans in his jurisdiction and he placed Father Pelamourgues in charge of the Sauk and Fox tribes in southeastern Iowa. School Undated photo of the original St. Anthony's Church built in 1838. Iowa's oldest church structure still in use. St. Anthony's School opened in 1839 with Father Pelamourgues as its teacher. Initially, classes were taught in the body of the church with a curtain closing off the sanctuary. In 1844 the church building was extended to the east to accommodate the new classroom space. The most prominent pupil to be educated at St. Anthony's in its early years was John Forrest Dillon, who would go on to become the Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court and a United States circuit court judge. In 1844 Father Pelamourgues convinced the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary to teach in the school and to start a school for girls. However, financial conditions were such that the sisters only stayed for three years. They returned in 1855 to teach at St. Anthony's. Immaculate Conception Academy was founded as a girls' school in 1859, and was located up the hill from St. Anthony's in 1864. The Sisters who taught at St. Anthony's lived at the academy. It remained in operation until it was merged with St. Ambrose Academy to form Assumption High School in 1958. It was at that time the parish purchased the Fred Finch House on Main Street for a convent to house the sisters who taught a St. Anthony's. The parish school at St. Anthony's continued until it closed in 1968 because of low enrollment. The building continues to be used for the parish's religious education program. Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourgues Growth The parish continued to grow. By 1847 there were 450 parishioners, which was still a quarter of the town's population. In 1850 the front section of the present church was begun. Thomas Doyle and Henry Belken were responsible for constructing the new church. with The building, completed in 1853 in the simple Greek Revival style, was built of locally quarried stone and measured . The original building was remodeled for more classroom space at this time. The rectory was built around 1877. New parishes were beginning to form in Davenport that took parishioners from St. Anthony's. St. Kunigunda (1855), which was renamed St. Joseph in 1881, served the pastoral needs of the growing German Community. St. Margaret's (1856) was built on top of the bluff to the east of downtown. St. Margaret's became Davenport's first cathedral in 1881 with the establishment of the Davenport Diocese. St. Anthony's was not chosen to be the cathedral because its downtown location was considered inappropriate.Svendsen, 11-2. St. Margaret's was renamed Sacred Heart when the present cathedral was built in 1891. St. Mary's Church was started in 1867 to serve the English speaking Catholics of the west end. Even though these new parishes were being formed, St. Anthony's continued to grow. Father Pelamourgues was succeeded by several priests who stayed for short periods of time until the Rev. D.J. Flannery arrived in 1882 and remained pastor until 1916. It was during his pastorate that transept wings with balconies were added to the church from 1885 to 1886 and the sanctuary was extended . A larger sacristy was also added to the church. The addition was built of brick. 20th Century The original church By the turn of the 20th century St. Anthony's became the only church downtown. By the end of the first decade the parish's boundaries had become fixed to the central city with the founding of two parishes on top of the hill: Holy Family (1898) in the northwest part of the city and St. Paul the Apostle (1909) on the east side. The grotto to the Blessed Virgin Mary on the north side of the church was added in the 1920s. It was rebuilt in 1998 and the current statue was placed in it in 1999. A major renovation was carried out in 1945 and 1948 when a manufactured stone facing, or permastone, was put on the 1886 addition to the church, the school (original church), and the rectory. This gave the parish complex a unified appearance. The sacristy was also expanded along the south transept. The north wing was also added to the school building. This was the last addition made to the original building. There was also an addition made to the rectory to create more living space for the resident clergy. In the 1960s changes were made to facilitate the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. While the communion rail was removed and a new free-standing altar was created so the priest could face the congregation, the old altars, frescos and statuary remain in the church. One of the more colorful chapters in the parish's history was the Folk Masses of the 1970s. Rev. James Grubb, the associate pastor, inspired the masses that included contemporary music played on guitars, colorful vestments, and young people sitting on the floor of the sanctuary. In 1987 the parish celebrated its sesquicentennial. To commemorate the occasion, a sculpture was commissioned and placed on the front of the church property facing Main Street. It depicts Father Mazzuchelli, a Sister of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a child representing the children who attended the parish school, Col. George Davenport (for whom the city of Davenport was named) and Antoine LeClaire. The statue group stands atop a pedestal that encloses the church's original bell. 21st Century The Gathering Center, which was built on the site of the former rectory in 2010. In 2009, most of the rectory was torn down to make room for a new parish center. Called the Gathering Center, the new facility is a building that includes classrooms with moveable walls for religious education classes, church offices, a kitchen and a renovated ‚ÄúMcAnthony‚Äôs Window,‚Äù a parish-based outreach program. A social hall that holds up to 300 people is also a part of the new facility. The new building and its landscaping are meant to blend into the historic Church Square property. The original church building was also renovated. In 2017 a new pipe organ was built by the Noack Organ Company of Georgetown, Massachusetts and installed in the church. It is the fourth organ the parish has owned since the church was built. The previous instrument dated from the 1940s. Social Action The parish has been involved in the social and civic life of the Davenport community almost from its very beginning. The Davenport Temperance Society, which was formed in 1842, held their weekly meetings at St. Anthony's. The church was the scene of public lectures including an 1857 series delivered to the Catholic Literary Institute. St. Mary‚Äôs Council of the Knights of Father Matthew, a fraternal beneficiary organization, met in the school hall in the early 1900s. During the same time period, the local Knights of Columbus council, the second to organize in the state, held special Masses at St. Anthony's. Both church leaders and parishioners protested city policies that taxed prostitution, gambling, and 24-hour saloons in the city. While these taxes benefited city coffers it was ultimately to the community's detriment. Civic justice issues, especially racial injustice, became prominent after World War II. St. Ambrose College professors embraced Catholic social action in the 1940s, establishing what is thought to be the first NAACP chapter on a Catholic college campus. They also established a League for Social Justice, which became the Catholic Interracial Council in 1957. This led to St. Anthony's being the starting point for the \\"March on Davenport.\\" Held in August 1963, about 2,000 participants marched to LeClaire Park to support the Iowa Fair Housing Act. In 1985 the parish began its ‚ÄúCare and Share‚Äù program under the direction of its pastor, the Rev. Kenneth Martin. Ten percent of the parish's weekly collection was set aside to aid those in need. His successor, the Rev. James Conroy began what has been dubbed ‚ÄúMcAnthony‚Äôs Window,‚Äù a program that serves lunch to the homeless and indigent people. Another food distribution program collects food for baskets that are distributed to the elderly and poor at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. Architecture Church interior at Christmas St. Anthony's Church follows a Latin Cross plan. The exterior of the front part of the church, which is the oldest section, is composed of quarry-faced, coursed, ashlar limestone. It reflects a period when highly skilled stonemasons and finely worked materials were not readily available in Davenport. The structure features a gable front, deep eave returns and a modillion frieze. Crosses are located at the peaks of the three gable ends. The rear of the church has a hip roof. The interior plan features a larger central nave that is flanked by side aisles. The apse, which appears rounded on the interior, is squared on the exterior. As mentioned earlier, the back addition to the church is covered in permastone. The round arch is used throughout the church. It is found in the stained glass windows, the vault of the ceiling, and on the reredos in the apse. It is also found on the main entrance into the church, which is capped with a fan-shaped tympanum. The stained glass is original to each section of the building when it was built. The ceiling features paintings over the center aisle. From the front entrance to the altar they depict Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead (or possibly raising the daughter of Naim), the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, and Jesus healing the sick. In the middle of the transept over the altar are symbols that represent the Four Evangelists. The statues in the reredos include the Sacred Heart in the center and it is flanked by Saint Patrick and Saint John the Evangelist. A bas-relief of the Last Supper is on the former altar frontal. There are also numerous other statues throughout the church. The church is set back from the street and is located in a park-like setting with mature vegetation. The former school building, which is also the original church, is a two-story, side gable building with a projecting entrance pavilion. It was originally a frame structure with a brick veneer exterior that has since been covered with permastone. Initially, it was rectangular in shape, but additions have created a cross-shaped plan. A round arch in the entrance gable end is its prominent decorative feature. There is also a cross above the entrance pavilion. The rectory, most of which is no longer extant, was also a frame structure with brick veneer that was covered with permastone. Designed in a vernacular style, it was a two-story, three bay front-gable house with a two-story side wing and further additions. A portion of one of those additions that included the garages remains behind the Gathering Center.

It can reach a length of SL. Feeding behavior and diet Like some other Geophagini cichlids, the common name 'eartheater' is attributed to their common feeding strategy of sifting through substrate (e.g., sand, small rock, silt) for food, where mouthfuls of substrate are taken up and sorted in the buccal cavity for food items. With the help of gill rakers, food is sorted and substrate is either spat out or sifted our from the operculum. While generally considered to be an invertivore, it has been documented as an omnivore in systems that have been disturbed by human activity. Commercial importance This species is of little importance to local commercial fisheries but has grown in popularity among the aquarium trade over the past several years. Breeding and reproduction As with most cichlids, this species does exhibit parental care. Parents will typically spawn in selected substrate and, after 24 hours, incubate eggs in the buccal cavity where young will seek refuge during the larval stage.

The Pateliya traditionally do not accept water or food from the minor ST castes as they consider themselves higher in the social hierarchy. The Pateliya are mostly distributed in Dahod Mahisagar Panchmahal districts of Gujarat and Jhabua, Dhar, Indore, Dewas, Guna districts of Madhya Pradesh. They speak Malvi among themselves and Hindi with others. Traditional occupation of the Pateliya is agriculture. They are in Variety of governmental services on higher posts. Apart from agriculture and services, several of them also work as wage labourers. Agriculture is an important source of earning. Rajput descent The community has a number of exogamous clans. All the clans enjoy an equal status. The Pateliya clans have been grouped under six broader categories; they appear to have been borrowed from Rajputs. They are Parmar, Solanki, Jadav, Chauhan, Gohil and Rathor. Parmar includes Skya, Bhagat, Gangodiya Budia, Glot, Godad, Wagal, Chautar, Kochara Devaliya, Suswad and Eal, clans. Solanki consists of Jhaniya, Rojada (Rose), Nalwaya, Ananiya, Cohari, Bariya, Chopada and Hihor. Jadav consists of clans like Khaped, Bhuriya, Damor, Hathila. Chauhan includes clans like B'habhor, Pasaya, Katara, Mori, Dundawa, Dhakiya and Wawadiya. Gohil have only one clan, Gamar. Rathore includes clans like Chota and Bada.

Its rhetoric often consists of anti-elitist sentiments, opposition to the Establishment and speaking for the \\"common people\\".Albertazzi and McDonnell, p. 123. Important themes for left-wing populists usually include anti-capitalism, social justice, pacifism and anti-globalization whereas class society ideology or socialist theory is not as important as it is to traditional left-wing parties. The criticism of capitalism and globalization is linked to anti- militarism, which has increased in the left populist movements as a result of unpopular United States military operations, especially those in the Middle East. It is considered that the populist left does not exclude others horizontally and relies on egalitarian ideals. Some scholars point out nationalist left-wing populist movements as well, a feature exhibited by Kemalism in Turkey for instance or the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela. Unlike exclusionary or right-wing populism, left-wing populist parties tend to be supportive of minority rights and to an idea of nationality that is not delimited by cultural or ethnic particularisms. With the rise of Greek Syriza, Spanish Podemos and to some extent the Italian Five Star Movement during the European debt crisis, there has been increased debate on new left-wing populism in Europe.  By country   European countries  Multinational coalitions Many leftist and populist political parties in Europe belong to the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left.  Germany  Oskar Lafontaine, member of The Left The Party of Democratic Socialism was explicitly studied under left-wing populism, especially by German academics. The party was formed after the reunification of Germany and it was similar to right-wing populists in that it relied on anti-elitism and media attention provided by a charismatic leadership.Albertazzi and McDonnell, p. 132. The party competed for the same voter base with the right-wing populists to some extent, although it relied on a more serious platform in Eastern Germany.

Greece  Syriza, which became the largest party since January 2015 elections, has been described as a left-wing populist party after their platform incorporated most demands of the popular movements in Greece during the government-debt crisis. Populist traits in Syriza's platform include growing importance of \\"the People\\" in their rhetoric and \\"us/the people against them/the establishment\\" antagonism in campaigning. On immigration and LGBT rights, Syriza is inclusionary. Syriza itself does not accept the label \\"populist\\".

La polemica con Saviano, Huffington Post In September 2019, the M5S formed a government with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the left- wing Free and Equal (LeU), with Giuseppe Conte at its head.

It opposes what it sees as the European superstate.  Spain  Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos The left-wing populist party Podemos achieved 8 percent of the national vote in the 2014 European Parliament election. Due to avoiding nativist language typical with right-wing populists, Podemos is able to attract all leftist voters disappointed with the political establishment without taking sides in the regional political struggle. At the 2015 election for the national parliament, Podemos reached 20.65% of the vote and became the third largest party in the parliament after the conservative People's Party with 28.71% and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party with 22.02%. In the new parliament, Podemos holds 69 out of 350 seats and this result ended the traditional two- party system of Spain.Entscheidung in Spanien: Konservative sind Wahlsieger, verlieren aber Mehrheit.

United Kingdom   South American countries   Argentina  Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner (the President of Argentina from 2007 to 2015) and her husband N√©stor Kirchner were said to practice Kirchnerism, a variant of Peronism that was often mentioned alongside other Pink tide governments in Latin America. During Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner time in office, she has spoken against certain free trade agreements such as the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. Her administration was characterized by tax increases, especially on agricultural exports during the late 2000s commodities boom, Argentina's main export, in order to fund social programs such as the PROGRESAR university scholarships, the universal allocation per child subsidy (commonly referred to as AUH in Argentina, Asignaci√≥n Universal por Hijo), a means-tested benefit to families with children who qualified for the subsidy, and progressive social reforms such as the recognition of same-sex marriage.  Bolivia  The leadership of Siles Zuazo practiced left-wing populism as well as that of former socialist President Evo Morales.  Ecuador  Rafael Correa, the former President of Ecuador, has stressed the importance of a \\"populist discourse\\" and has integrated technocrats to work within this context for the common Ecuadorians.

Arkwright was the second son of John Arkwright, of Hampton Court, Herefordshire, and the great-grandson of the cotton-spinning industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright. His brother, John Hungerford Arkwright, was Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire, whose son John Stanhope Arkwright was also an MP. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1857. He was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1859 and in 1862 married Lady Mary Caroline Byng, a daughter of the Earl of Strafford. Arkwright was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leominster at an unopposed by-election in February 1866, and stated that his position was not to oppose every change, but that he was against any 'great organic changes being made in matters connected with Church or State'. He held the seat until he resigned from the House of Commons on 8 February 1876. At the resulting by-election, the Leominster seat was gained by a Liberal. After retiring from parliament, Arkwright was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Herefordshire. In 1886, Arkwright published Driven Home: A Tale of Destiny under the pseudonym Evelyn Owen. It is a mystery story with supernatural elements. In 1889, he published a second novel, The Queen Anne‚Äôs Gate Mystery. This is a detective story with an aristocratic female detective Lady Geraldine accompanied by her husband, who is also the narrator.

Madrid Pedro de Ribera (Madrid 4 August 1681 - Madrid, 1742) was a Spanish architect of the Baroque period. Biography Ribera worked almost exclusively in Madrid during the first half of the 18th century. He was a disciple of Jos√© Benito de Churriguera (creator of the style Churrigueresque). Following in the footsteps of his master, Ribera is considered one of the most important architects of the late Baroque period in Spain. He designed a remarkable quantity of work in Madrid, the capital of Spain, giving the city bridges, palaces, monumental fountains, churches and a variety of public buildings, many of which can still be seen. Between 1718 and 1719, he was Lieutenant Major Master of Works and sources of Madrid, succeeding Theodore Ardemans following his death. This position cemented his reputation and allowed him to occupy an important position at court, despite the clear preference of King Philip V of Spain of the sort of foreign architects working in Madrid in the 1720s. Many of Ribera's creations were destroyed or modified later, especially in the 18th century, when Neoclassicism was a dominating movement. Ribera's architectural style was attacked by influential art scholars like Antonio Ponz.

The clubhouse was originally a small room in the house of Mr. Justino, where he kept all the belongings of the club, then moving to the house of the Tamanqueiros to finally settle in the Rua Nova do Seixo, called the second home of \\"Mr. Abbot\\" that belonged to the priest Me√£o, which coincidences of fate is now the personal residence of the current President Germano Pinho. The first equipment was made in white cloth by a dressmaker, had a single red stripe, horizontal, and white shorts, unlike the current, which shows three white horizontal red stripes and blue shorts. The only sport practiced in this first phase of the club was football. The first official game was played with Leix√µes, in the old field of Santana. The club competed in the Division 1 League for the Promotion of the municipality of Matosinhos, winning the title, at least in the years 1932, 1933 and 1934, as listed in the Diploma in currently existing assets of the club. At a date not fully determined, the club participated in the contest of the Cup of Portugal, and the game played with Leix√µes in the old stadium of Amial. The biggest victory of Padroense F. C., throughout its existence, was achieved against Baliense (23‚Äì2) in the field of Monte da Mina. From 1948 onward the club successively expanded its sports sections, such as football, volleyball, table tennis, billiards, cycling, boxing, handball and recreational fishing, in addition to these a section of theatre and representation was also created. Subsequently, because of material difficulties, human and financial, some of these sections have fallen into inactivity, with only the sections of football and handball remaining active. The clubhouse at the time at Rua Nova do Seixo, the priest's house, was moved to a building of its own, where there are now two shops owned by the club, and in 1998 it was fixated at the Stadium Club, where it still remains.History of the Padroense Futebol Clube Football Football is the only modality that has remained continuously in operation, having achieved over all these years some regional titles.

These children are disposed of either through drowning, putting soil in their mouths and strangling or leaving infants in the forest.

Quoted in Vattier 1890:217. Mariette makes errors about his teacher in Rome, however. Dumont returned to Paris in 1725. In 1727, he first showed at the Paris Salon and in 1728 he was received as a member of the Acad√©mie royal de peinture et de sculpture, with a Hercule et Omphale as his morceau de reception.At the museum in Tours, according to Vattier 218. At meetings he terrorized his fellow-academicians with his acerbic and caustic wit.

In 1731 he was appointed painter to the tapestry manufacture at Aubusson and served in that capacity until 1755, forming a school of designers there that raised standards of quality. His contract required six cartoons and three designs for pile carpets annually.Alfred de Champeaux, Tapestry (Victoria and Albert Museum) 1878:40. Aubusson's rivals at the royal manufacture of the Gobelins gave him a back-handed compliment in a memoire to the royal administration dated 10 March 1754, and signed by Audran, Cozette and Neilson: \\"to prevent the decadence of the Gobelin Factory, it would be necessary to attach to it Sr. Boucher,\\" giving him the assistance of other painters of the Acad√©mie such as \\"Sieurs Dumont Le Romain, Jeaurat, Halle, Challe, Vien.\\"Noted in George Leland Hunter, Tapestries; Their Origin, History And Renaissance, \\"French Looms, The Gobelins: Beauvais: Aubusson.

With this and other wedges, the Israelis hoped to divide various units in the Egyptian army's expeditionary force in Palestine as part of Operation Yoav's plan. The battles around the wedge were fought on October 15‚Äì22, 1948. Creating the wedge involved the capture of a series of positions overlooking Beit Hanoun (October 15‚Äì19), and eventually taking the village itself (October 20‚Äì22). The Israelis deployed a reinforced battalion from the Yiftach Brigade for the operation, with another battalion in the reserve. On the first day, eight outlying positions were captured with little resistance, and bridges surrounding Beit Hanoun were blown up. The Egyptians created a bypass to the west of the road and managed to evacuate their staff. The Israelis captured Beit Hanoun on October 19‚Äì20 and more outlying positions, which forced Egypt to move their forces through the sands between the road and the Mediterranean Sea. The Beit Hanoun wedge as a tactic was unsuccessful, because the objective of dividing the Egyptian expeditionary force was not achieved, but it accomplished other strategic goals in Operation Yoav. Background The second truce of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War started on July 18, 1948, with an Israeli enclave in the Negev disconnected from the rest of the country. Military operations, including An-Far, Death to the Invader and GYS, to create a corridor between the two areas, failed. The United Nations mediator Folke Bernadotte's second plan for Palestine became known on September 20, days after Bernadotte was assassinated by the Lehi. This plan envisioned the Israeli Negev enclave to be handed over to the Arab side. Israel's military options were pondered by its leadership during the second truce, and the Bernadotte Plan prompted the government and army to decide to concentrate the next effort on the southern front. The Operation, codenamed The Ten Plagues, was meant to open a permanent ground connection to the Negev, and gradually encircle the Egyptian forces in the Majdal ‚Äì Bayt Jibrin corridor by creating wedges that would deny the Egyptians free movements between their main troop concentrations. This was the approach favored by Yigal Allon, head of the Southern Command, which mostly won over the General Staff's proposals to directly assault the large Egyptian concentrations. The Yiftach Brigade, which previously had participated in Operation GYS but was not native to the Negev theater, was an integral part of the operation, and already infiltrated the area in Operation Avak during the second truce. Forces from the 8th and 9th brigades (the IDF's operational reserve) were also brought in to assist. Beit Hanoun was a Palestinian Arab village in southwestern Palestine, just northeast of Gaza, located on the coastal road. Its vicinity was selected as one of the three main wedge locations, the others being Khirbet Masara, southeast of Iraq al-Manshiyya, and Kawkaba. Creating the wedge On the night of October 15, 1948, Israel sent a convoy to the Negev, hoping that the Egyptians would shoot at it and give the Israeli forces an excuse to start the operation. The forces for creating the two wedges set out. The Yiftach force consisted of three companies from the 3rd Battalion, two platoons from the 8th Battalion (Negev Brigade), two 65 mm cannon batteries, one 75 mm cannon battery, one mortar platoon, one machine gun platoon, two mobile 20 mm cannons. Another reinforced battalion was placed in the operational reserve. Most of the forces moved to the northwest from Nir Am to a line about 600 m east of Beit Hanoun. On the first night, eight positions were captured with only light resistance: Hill 113.9 just north of Nir Am, where they set up the mission's headquarters, and Hills 81.2, 75.6, 79.6, 78.7, 84.4, 80.1 and 110.7. Meanwhile, a small contingent moved to the north and south of Beit Hanoun and blew up the road bridges around the village‚Äîabove Wadi al-Halib to the south and Wadi al-Hesi. The railway bridge was rendered unusable. The Egyptians attempted a counterattack on Hill 81.2 (the northernmost one held by Israel) in the same night, but were repelled. An Egyptian armored force that attempted to reinforce Beit Hanoun from the south met with heavy fire from the Israeli forces at the southern bridge and retreated. At 15:00 on October 16, the Israelis staged a raid on Dimra, but failed to take the village. They also took heavy aircraft and artillery fire from the Egyptians, who were able to inflict significant damage because the Israelis were not properly dug in and the engineers had not yet finished creating proper cover. On October 17, the Egyptians sent troops to Hill 60.3 (\\"The Tree\\"), just north of 81.2. An Egyptian convoy going south from Majdal at 08:00 was fired at by Yiftach, and started moving west of the main road. Some vehicles were hit, but the majority successfully avoiding the Israeli guns. At night, Yiftach took Hill 81, slightly closer to the road. On October 18, the Egyptians staged another attack on Israeli-held positions, this time 75.6 and 81. The day after that, they evacuated their divisional staff from Majdal, under a smoke screen and heavy air and artillery barrage, using the alternative path created by the previous convoys. Seeing that their wedge was ineffective, the Israelis sought to deepen it. On the night of October 19‚Äì20, the Yiftach forces took over Beit Hanoun itself in the west, and Hill 60.3 and Dimra in the north. On the following night, Hills 57 and 70, overlooking Beit Hanoun, were captured to strengthen the hold on the wedge. Egyptian forces were thus unable to use their alternative road and created yet another bypass, this time in the sands further to the west. This involved significant engineering work, and a makeshift road of wood and wire netting was laid on the shoreline, which trucks and armored vehicles were able to move through.

On the other hand, it achieved a strategic goal‚Äîa significant number of Egyptian forces were allocated to fighting the Israelis in the wedge, which eased the other battles of Operation Yoav for Israel. Some scholars are of the opinion however, that completely cutting off the Egyptian headquarters was never an objective of the wedge. They believe that the Israelis foresaw a situation like the one of the Fallujah Pocket, where a large stationary Egyptian force was indeed surrounded, eventually leading to heavy Israeli casualties and a failure to take the pocket. The Beit Hanoun wedge, however, created just enough of a panic for Egypt to start evacuating major forces, but prevented a situation where they would dig in and pose a significant obstacle. The forces that would later be trapped in the Fallujah Pocket were indeed part of the Egyptian division headquarters' withdrawal request. As part of the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Egypt, Israel agreed to hand over territories around Rafah and Beit Hanoun, including the wedge, in exchange for the Egyptian evacuation of the Fallujah Pocket.

It is one in a series of compositions commissioned by the bandleader/clarinetist featuring solo clarinet, and the score is dedicated to him. It was first performed on March 25, 1946 in Carnegie Hall in New York City, by Woody Herman's Band, conducted by Walter Hendl. History Woody Herman in 1949 Stravinsky's engagement with jazz dates back to the closing years of the First World War, the major jazz-inspired works of that period being L'histoire du soldat, the Ragtime for eleven instruments, and the Piano- Rag-Music. Although traces of jazz elements, especially blues and boogie- woogie, can be found in his music throughout the 1920s and 1930s, it was only with the Ebony Concerto that Stravinsky once again incorporated features of jazz into a composition on a far-reaching scale. The title was originally suggested to Stravinsky by Aaron Goldmark, of Leeds Music Corporation, who had negotiated the commission and suggested the form it should take.; The composer explained that his title does not refer to the clarinet, as might be supposed, but rather to Africa, because \\"the jazz performers I most admired at that time were Art Tatum, Charlie Parker, and the guitarist Charles Christian. And blues meant African culture to me.\\" The official blurb published with the score says that Stravinsky had been so impressed with recordings of the Herman band, such as \\"Bijou\\", \\"Goosey Gander\\", and \\"Caldonia\\", that, when asked, he agreed to write a piece for them with a solo clarinet part for Herman. However, according to Herman's trumpeter and arranger Neal Hefti, this story may be somewhat embroidered. Hefti and his trumpeter colleague, Pete Candoli, were both great fans of Stravinsky's music, so after Hefti returned to the band after six months spent in California working in the film industry, Candoli wanted to know if he had met the great man. Hefti had not, but pretended he had done so, and he embellished his story by claiming, \\"I played him the records [of the Herman band], and he thinks they're great.\\" The rumor quickly spread, and within two days the publisher Lou Levy of Leeds Music had arranged for Herman to contact Stravinsky (who probably had never heard the Herman band up to that point), and this led to the commission of the concerto. Once having accepted the commission, Stravinsky decided to create a jazz-based version of a concerto grosso, with a blues as the slow movement. If he had not previously heard them, he now listened to recordings of the Herman band, and went so far as to consult a saxophonist in order to learn how the instrument is fingered. The project nearly foundered when a publicity story was published in September 1945, claiming a \\"collaboration\\" between Stravinsky and Herman. Stravinsky withdrew from the agreement until his lawyer, Aaron Sapiro, convinced him that no offense had been intended. The score of the first two movements was delivered to Herman on November 22, 1945, and the finale followed on December 10. In February 1946 the composer chose Walter Hendl, assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, to conduct the premiere at Carnegie Hall the following month, but Stravinsky himself first rehearsed the band‚Äîbackstage at New York's Paramount Theatre, where they were appearing at the time. Herman found the solo part frighteningly difficult, and did not feel that Stravinsky had really adapted his writing to the jazz-band idiom. Instead, he \\"wrote pure Stravinsky\\", and the band did not feel at all comfortable with the score initially. \\"After the very first rehearsal, at which we were all so embarrassed we were nearly crying because nobody could read, he walked over and put his arm around me and said, 'Ah, what a beautiful family you have.'\\" Instrumentation The Ebony Concerto is scored for solo clarinet in B and a jazz band consisting of two alto saxophones in E, two tenor saxophones in B, baritone saxophone in E, three clarinets in B (doubled by first and second alto and first tenor saxophone players), bass clarinet in B (doubled by second tenor saxophone), horn in F, five trumpets in B, three trombones, piano, harp, guitar, double bass, and drum set. The horn and harp were additions to the normal make-up of the Herman band. Stravinsky's original plan was to include an oboe as well, but this instrument did not survive into the final version of the score. Movements A typical performance lasts about eleven minutes. Analysis The first movement is a sonata-allegro in B major with a second subject in E major. The second movement is a blues in F minor, turning to F major at the end. The finale is a theme and variations with a coda. The final variation, marked \\"Vivo\\", features the solo clarinet in one last virtuoso display. Amongst Stravinsky's compositions using variation form, the concerto is unusual for several reasons. First, it employs this form as a finale. Second, the variation movement begins and ends in the same key (which would be normal for most composers, but not Stravinsky, who only adheres to this practice in one other composition, the Sonata for Two Pianos). Third, the second variation literally repeats the melodic theme, thus functioning as a sort of internal recapitulation and thereby suggesting a fusing of variation with rondo form. Recordings On November 4, 1945, while still in the midst of composing the concerto, Stravinsky wrote a letter to Nadia Boulanger describing his progress as well as plans to make a recording with the Herman band in February 1946. This recording session was ultimately postponed but, at that time, Stravinsky foresaw its release on a 78-rpm disc, with the first two movements on one side and the theme and variations on the other. He expected the durations of the three movements to be just two-and-a- half, two, and three minutes. On 19 August 1946, the day after performing the piece together on a \\"Columbia Workshop\\" national broadcast, Herman and Stravinsky recorded the concerto in Hollywood, California.. The recording was first released on LP in 1951, Columbia ML 4398 . Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures, as this was more than a decade before Dave Brubeck started using unusual time signatures in jazz performance and virtually all jazz was played in .Lamb, Evelyn. \\"Uncommon Time: What Makes Dave Brubeck's Unorthodox Jazz Stylings So Appealing?\\", Scientific American, December 11, 2012. Saxophonist Flip Phillips said that \\"during the rehearsal [...] there was a passage I had to play there and I was playing it soft, and Stravinsky said, 'Play it, here I am!' and I blew it louder and he threw me a kiss!'\\" In the late 1950s Herman made a second recording, in stereo, in the Belock Recording Studio at Bayside New York,Liner notes of the LP re-release by the Everest Recording Group Inc. in January 1959 as SDBR 3009. The recording was originally released on LP in 1958 as Everest LPBR 6009 and was released on CD in 1997 by Everest, EVC 9049. calling it a \\"very delicate and a very sad piece\\". On April 27, 1965, Stravinsky recorded it again with Benny Goodman and the Columbia Jazz Ensemble at the CBS Studio at 230 East 30th Street in New York,. First released on LP in 1966 on Columbia Masterworks MS 6805; reissued August 1971 on Columbia M 30579 . Reissued on CD in 1994, EMI Classics/Sony Classical: Tutti Nr. 12 (Dutch issue) or possibly in Hollywood.Notes by Joanna Wyld in the booklet for the 2007 reissue as part of Works of Igor Stravinsky, 22-CD set, Sony Classical 88697103112, where this recording of the Ebony Concerto is on disc 12: Chamber Music & Historical Recordings Vol. 1 Sony 88697103112-12. A comparison of an earlier CD reissue of this recording (CBS MK 42227) with the version issued in 2007 as part of the Works of Igor Stravinsky 22-CD boxed set (Sony Classical 88697103112) suggests that, though both are oddly balanced, a remix has both reduced the clarity of the recording and resulted in a version in which \\"the gracious soloist appears gradually to fade from the spotlight\\". Other conductors who have recorded this work include Pierre Boulez (1982), Simon Rattle (1987 and 2018), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1992), and Michael Tilson Thomas (1998). Ballet In 1957 the choreographer Alan Carter used the Ebony Concerto (together with Stravinsky's Circus Polka, Fireworks, and Ode) to accompany a ballet titled Feuilleton, which was danced at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich. In 1960 the concerto was used alone for a ballet production by the New York City Ballet, choreographed by John Taras and with costumes and d√©cor by David Hays.

The public scribes were the highest in rank of the four prestigious occupational grades (decuriae) among the apparitores, the attendants of the magistrates who were paid from the state treasury.The others are the lictores, \\"lictors\\"; viatores, \\"messengers\\" or \\"summoners,\\" that is, agents on official errands; and praecones, \\"announcers\\" or \\"heralds.\\" See Marietta Horster, \\"Living on Religion: Professionals and Personnel,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 334; Daniel Peretz, \\"The Roman Interpreter and His Diplomatic and Military Roles,\\" Historia 55 (2006), p. 452. The word scriba might also refer to a man who was a private secretary, but should be distinguished from a copyist (who might be called a \\"scribe\\" in English) or bookseller (librarius).Peter White, \\"Bookshops in the Literary Culture of Rome,\\" in Ancient Literacies: The Culture of Reading in Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 269, note 4. In Rome the scribae worked out of the aerarium, the state treasury and government archive. They received a good salary, but could earn additional commissions for collecting and recording state revenues, and making official copies of government documents and decrees. The Roman posting was such a lucrative assignment that the scribae worked in rotations, serving one year in Rome and two in the provinces. Those who became scribes might be freedmen (libertini) and their sons; literary or educated men who advanced to the job through patronage; or even men of the equestrian order.David Armstrong, Horace (Yale University Press, 1989), p. 18. Among the scribe's duties was the recording of sworn oaths on public tablets.Clifford Ando, Imperial Ideology and Provincial Loyalty in the Roman Empire (University of California Press, 2000), p. 96. As a magistrate's attendant, he might also assist in religious rituals; for instance, since the exact wording of a prescribed prayer was considered vital to its success, a scribe might prompt the presiding magistrate by reading it out as recorded on official tablets.Valerius Maximus 4.1.10; Eric M. Orlin, Temples, Religions, and Politics in the Roman Republic (Brill, 1997), p. 37; on the use of prompters in general, see Matthias Klinghardt, \\"Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion,\\" Numen 46 (1999) 1‚Äì52. By the end of the 4th century BC, the office evidently afforded several advantages, including a knowledge of Roman law that was traditionally the privilege of the elite, and the ability to trade favors that could be translated into political capital. In 305 BC, the public scribe Gnaeus Flavius, the son of a freedman, shocked the Roman upperclasses by winning election as curule aedile for the following year. Though not the first plebeian to hold the office,T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, pp. 166‚Äì168. his victory, made possible by the growing number of freedmen and those of libertine descent among the urban population, prompted the censors of 304 BC to adopt voter registration policies that curtailed the political power of the lower orders.Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War (University of California Press, 2005), p. 319. Gaius Cicereius, a former scriba of Scipio Africanus, was elected praetor in 173 BC, and enjoyed greater popularity than Scipio's own son. Certainly by the late Republic, the scribae had become a well-organized group who had achieved or were near to equestrian status.Forsythe, Critical History, p. 319. The scriba Sextus Cloelius kept a high profile as an agent of the popularist Clodius Pulcher. At the beginning of Clodius's year in office as tribune of the plebs in 58 BC, Cloelius organized ludi compitalicii, neighborhood new-year festivities that had been banned as promoting unrest and political subversion. Cloelius also led the people in riots when Clodius was murdered a few years later, taking his body to the senate house and turning it into the popular leader's funeral pyre.Geoffrey S.

The station is currently owned by Victoria Radioworks, LLC. History KITE was first proposed by Louis Thurmond \\"Culp\\" Krueger and his partners, under the licensee name Victoria Broadcasting Company in 1948. The facility received its construction permit on January 7, 1949, with a call letter assignment of KALO. Initially authorized at 500 watts, daytime operation only, from a transmit site on Bottom Street in Victoria. The callsign was quickly changed two months later, in March 1949, to KNAL, which was chosen to honor the creation of the Victoria Barge Canal, which linked landlocked Victoria to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and other various ports around the world. The facility received it License to Cover on May 20. KNAL received a grant to build a second tower in 1950, giving the proposed nighttime facility a directional signal to the north at dark, in order to conduct unlimited hours broadcasting by 1951. The KALO callsign would ultimately have its own lengthy history in Beaumont, Texas as \\"Kay-Lo\\", a vital Urban voice in Beaumont's Black community. Louis \\"Culp\\" Krueger had previously been the driving force in signing on 1390 KULP a year earlier in El Campo. 1410 would become the group's second licensed facility, with both stations programming Country music. 1410 has maintained a Country format for the majority of its existence. The station has also utilized a Newstalk format in its past, as well as a Nostalgia/Standards format. KNAL changed its callsign to KYVF on April 9, 1999, and returned to it heritage KNAL on February 15, 2002.

Licensed to Bellville, Texas, United States, it serves the Victoria and Houston regional area. The station is owned by Jerome Friemel, through licensee JLF Communications, LLC. The station operates on a Class D daytime license on 1090 kHz. Because KULF shares the same frequency as clear-channel station KAAY in Little Rock, Arkansas, it only broadcasts during daytime hours. It previously was on 790 AM from August 1970 to early July 1982, when the call letters changed to KKBQ (now KBME). History Birth of Radio 1090 KACO 1090 signed on the air in 1974 as Austin County's first and only licensed radio station. It was owned by Mr. and Mrs. J. Lee Dittert. 1090 was granted the calls of KACO, representing not just service to its community of license Bellville, but to the entire Austin County population. KACO started as a 250-watt daytimer featuring a country & western format. KACO Sold; Henderson Stewardship In 1990, the Dittert family sold the facility to Roy Henderson, with the original KACO call letters being retired in 1993, as 1090 changed its callsign to KFRD, which itself had been located at 980 AM in Rosenberg, Texas, since its sign-on in 1949. Four years later, 1090 received a grant to change its call letters again and use the KNUZ calls that had occupied 1230 AM in Houston since the 1940s. As KNUZ, and under Roy Henderson's direction, the station simulcasted \\"Lite 94.1\\" KLTR out of Brenham. In November 2009, the facility dropped the KNUZ call letters and briefly used KBAL, until a switch could be made with the co-owned facility in San Saba. As a result of the call switch, the KNUZ calls are now used for 106.1 FM in San Saba, the former KBAL. Sale to JLF Communications; Flip to Brokered In December 2009, the station was sold for a reported $500,000 by Roy E. Henderson to JHT Ventures, Inc., 100% controlled by Janice Hollan. JHT sold KULF to Jerome Friemel's JLF Communications, LLC at a purchase price of $10,000; the transaction was consummated on January 29, 2013. 1090 returned to the air with an Oldies format stunt that lasted until paid programming could be secured for the signal to air. Once that occurred, the temporary Oldies format was dropped and replaced with Spanish language Christian programming \\"La Luz\\". This programming would prove to be short lived as well. In August 2015, JLF Communications added a translator at 102.5, bringing 1090's programming to FM. In January 2016, KULF was stopped as a result of non- payment of rent to the landowner on which the KULF towers and transmission equipment reside. According to radio insider sources, the landowner had a court order that gave him legal possession of all equipment related to KULF, sans the broadcast license itself. The Houston FCC agent took KULF off of the air, as for a period of over a month, 1090 remained on air both day and night, running 1,000 watts of dead air. As of May 2016, KULF has returned to the air at full power, resuming programming.

The station is currently owned by Davies Communications. The station first went on the air Jan. 4, 1949 as KNEX. KNEX operated out of a two-story farm house south of McPherson, known as the Crumpacker place. The first owners in 1949 were Ken Krebhiel (who also owned The Republican newspaper), Paul Sargent of Peoples Bank and Trust, John Griffith, owner of Friends Drug Store, and Everette Mills, a McPherson attorney. KNEX' most enduring employee was Claude Hughes, who came to McPherson from Garden City. He began as the station's first engineer in 1949. But he quickly moved up to station manager by 1956. \\"Cousin' Claude\\", as his listeners called him, hosted a number of programs, including \\"Sunny Side of the Street.\\" And he reported McPherson's weather conditions from the \\"Weather Garden\\". Claude worked for the station until his death in 2003. Another notable voice on the station was Bob Hapgood, who Claude Hughes hired in 1968. Bob was the leader of a popular regional band called King Midas and the Mufflers. He would draw on his experience as drummer for the band to host an oldies show on KNEX for many years. Initially the station had both an AM and FM license, but dropped the FM license because few people had FM radios in the 1950s. Later, in 1980, an FM license was re-issued for KNEX-FM. In 1979 new owners took over the stations and chose call letters inspired by their names, Joe Engle (KNGL) and Bernard Brown (KBBE-FM).

The tactic aimed to cause losses sufficient to halt or at least reduce the Western Allies' bombing of Germany.Der Spiegel ‚Äì Deutsche Kamikaze-Flieger; Himmelfahrtskommando f√ºr Hitler The pilots were expected to parachute out either just before or after they had collided with their target. The chances of a Sonderkommando Elbe pilot surviving such a practice were low, at a time when the Luftwaffe was lacking sufficient numbers of well-trained pilots. History A 1944 drawing by Helmuth Ellgaard illustrating \\"ramming\\" Sonderkommando literally means \\"special command\\", and the Elbe is one of the main rivers in Germany. The aircraft of choice for this mission was usually a later G-version (Gustav) of the Messerschmitt Bf 109, stripped of armor and armament. The heavily stripped-down planes had one synchronized machine gun (usually a single MG 131 in the upper engine cowling) instead of up to four automatic weapons (usually including a pair of 20mm or 30mm underwing-mount autocannon) on fully equipped Bf 109G interceptors, and were only allotted 60 rounds each, a normally insufficient amount for bomber-interception missions. To accomplish their mission, Sonderkommando Elbe pilots would typically aim to ram one of three sensitive areas on the bombers: the empennage with its relatively delicate control surfaces, the engine nacelles which were connected to the highly explosive fuel system, or the cockpit itself. One of the most famous reports of cockpit ramming was against a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber, nicknamed \\"Palace of Dallas\\", along with another bomber that the German plane careened into after slicing the cockpit of the Palace of Dallas.#44-49533 12 O'clock High Forum Adding to the last-ditch nature of this task force, the only mission was flown on 7 April 1945 by a sortie of 180 Bf 109s.

This aim was pursued through organising exhibitions, lectures, music performances, and conferences in the United States (primarily New York) and Africa (occasionally).

Visitors to the website begin an online chat (text, audio, and video) with another visitor. At any point, either user may leave the current chat by initiating another random connection. According to The New York Times, the site is intensely addictive. In February 2010, a few months after the website was created, about 35,000 people were on Chatroulette at any given time. Around the beginning of March, creator Andrey Ternovskiy estimated the site to have around 1.5 million users. According to a survey carried out by RJMetrics, about one in eight spins on Chatroulette yielded \\"R-rated\\" content. Parody shows such as The Daily Show and South Park have lampooned this aspect of the service, and nudity has become an established part of the site's notoriety. In spring 2020, Ternovskiy appointed Andrew William Done, Australian tech entrepreneur, as the CEO of Chatroulette. Done has previously founded companies like Simple Machines in Sydney, Australia, and operated as CTO for multiple tech start ups, such as Goodlord in London. Following product changes in spring 2020, and enhanced by the COVID-19 Pandemic, Chatroulette's user numbers have more than doubled between 2019 and 2020. Due to a big relaunch of Chatroulette in June 2020, including new features and a more reliable and modern platform, user numbers are expected to continuously grow. Overview The Chatroulette website was created by Andrey Ternovskiy, a 17-year-old high-school student in Moscow, Russia. Ternovskiy says the concept arose from video chats he used to have with friends on Skype, and that he wrote the first version of Chatroulette in \\"two days and two nights\\".Yevgeny Kondakov and Benjamin Bidder: 17-Year-Old Chatroulette Founder: 'Mom, Dad, the Site Is Expanding' Interview with Andrey Ternovskiy, Der Spiegel, 5 March 2010 Ternovskiy chose the name \\"Chatroulette\\" after watching The Deer Hunter, a 1978 film set in the Vietnam War in which prisoners of war are forced to play Russian roulette.Nick Bilton: One on One: Andrey Ternovskiy, Creator of Chatroulette (interview) Bits Blog, The New York Times online, March 12, 2010 The site pairs its users at random, and allows them to type messages to one another while watching the other user's webcam. Ternovskiy built the site on an old computer he had in his bedroom. The site initially had 20 users, and then it doubled daily for a period, according to Ternovskiy in 2010. He discusses that he did not advertise or post his site anywhere; in fact, people starting talking about the website and knowledge of it gradually spread by word of mouth. As the number of active users grew, Ternovskiy has had to rewrite the entire code to cope with the load, the management of which being the most challenging part of his project. Despite the expansion of the service, he still codes everything on his own. Ternovskiy sought help from his longtime friend Vlad Kostanyan, who helped him with his side projects. In early November 2009, shortly after the site launched, it had 500 visitors per day. One month later there were 50,000. The site has been featured in The New York Times, The New Yorker, New York magazine, and on Good Morning America, Newsnight in the United Kingdom, Tosh.0, and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In February 2010, about 35,000 people were on Chatroulette at any given time. Around the beginning of March, Ternovskiy estimated the site to have around 1.5 million users, around 33% of them from the United States and 5% from Germany. An early growth phase was funded by a $10,000 investment from Ternovskiy's parents, which he soon paid back. , Ternovskiy was running the site from his childhood bedroom, assisted by four programmers who were working remotely, and the site was supported through advertising links to an online dating service. The site uses several high-end servers all located in Frankfurt, Germany. In June 2010 Andrey was awarded by Webby for excellence on the Internet According to New York Times, the site is intensely addictive. One informal study published in March 2010 showed that nearly half of all Chatroulette \\"spins\\" connected a user with someone in the US, while the next most likely country was France with 15%. On average, in sessions showing a single person 89% of these were male and 11% were female; 8% of spins showed multiple people behind the camera. About one in three females appeared as such a group, and one in 12 males. A user was more likely to encounter a webcam featuring no person at all than one featuring a sole female. About one in eight spins yielded someone apparently naked, exposing themselves, or engaging in a sexual act. A user was twice as likely to encounter a sign requesting female nudity than to encounter actual female nudity. The website uses Adobe Flash to display video and access the user's webcam. Flash's peer-to-peer network capabilities (via RTMFP) allow almost all video and audio streams to travel directly between user computers, without using server bandwidth. However, certain combinations of routers will not allow UDP traffic to flow between them, and then falling back to RTMP is necessary. Initially, the site only asked users to confirm that they are at least 18 years old and agree on terms to not broadcast any offensive or pornographic content. Login or registration was not required. However, the website now requires users to register for free before they can use the features of the website. The signup requires a username, email address, and password. Details such as age, gender, and location can be further added under profile and settings. This tab also allows users to write an 'about me' section about themselves, including languages they speak and their taste in music, movies, and games. Users can also upload an image of themselves to add to their profiles. Inappropriate content Alert message shown after the user has been reported three times Within a year of the site's launch, Chatroulette received criticism, particularly with respect to the offensive, obscene, or pornographic material that some users of this site were exhibiting. Psychiatrist Dr. Keith Ablow advised, \\"Parents should keep all their children off the site because it's much too dangerous for children. It's a predator's paradise. This is one of the worst faces of the Internet that I've seen. It's disconnecting human relationships rather than connecting them.\\" Emie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told CBS' The Early Show that the site was the \\"last place parents want their kids to be. This is a huge red flag; this is extreme social networking. This is a place kids are going to gravitate to.\\" Ternovskiy told the New York Times that \\"Everyone finds his own way of using the site. Some think it is a game, others think it is a whole unknown world, others think it is a dating service. I think it's cool that such a concept can be useful for so many people. Although some people are using the site in not very nice ways -- I am really against it.\\" Early users of the site would frequently encounter users who were naked or masturbating in front of the camera. According to certain reports and a firsthand test, the majority of the site's users are male and overwhelmingly young, and people in their 30s are usually mocked on the site for being too \\"old\\". Some users dress in costumes to entertain the viewer the site pairs them with, while others play music or host dance parties. In 2011, artists Eva and Franco Mattes presented random Chatroulette users with a staged view of a man who had apparently hanged himself, and recorded the reactions. According to a survey carried out by RJMetrics, about one in eight of feeds from Chatroulette involved \\"R-rated\\" content. Parody shows such as The Daily Show and South Park have lampooned this aspect of the service, and nudity has become an established part of the site's notoriety.South Park Takes on Tron, Facebook, and Chat Roulette from MovieViral.com A complicated legal environment surrounds Chatroulette with respect to the sexual activities that occur frequently on the site. These activities may be illegal, but who is liable for such content is uncertain due to the level of anonymity of the users. Reaction to criticisms In response, the website has discouraged under-18s from using the site, and prohibits \\"pornographic\\" behavior. Users who experience harassment or witness illegal, immoral, or pornographic activity may report the offending user. If three users complain about the same participant within five minutes, the user is temporarily banned from the service. In August 2012, Chatroulette removed the Safe Mode feature of the website, and posted new terms and conditions, stating that nudity was no longer allowed on any part of the site.Chatroulette Deletes Safe Mode from roulettechatsites.com Chatroulette later changed their terms of use, making it a requirement that all users sign up before using the service. Early in the site's operation, an algorithm was developed to successfully filter out large quantities of obscene content on Chatroulette, considering that as much as 30% of the 8.5 million monthly unique visitors are under 18 years of age. This has led to a higher proportion of female users accessing the service due to the cleanup. The image recognition algorithms automatically flag users broadcasting sexual content. The filter works in a manner that it identifies excessive amounts of revealed skin while simultaneously recognizes faces as appropriate. A 20,000-user-based sample study proved that the algorithm is able to filter out nearly 60% of the offensive material along with ads on the site. While the video streams are transmitted in a peer-to-peer manner, without passing through the site's server, Chatroulette does periodically take screenshots of the users' video content. Humans then check the screenshots flagged by the algorithms and proceed to block the offending users for a period of time. In an interview, Ternovskiy states, \\"While recognition software improves, we have employed a moderation team to review pictures manually. We now have around 100 moderators who are all monitoring all webcam feeds and marking inappropriate ones. The combination of filter technology and moderation results in the banning of 50,000 inappropriate users daily.\\" See also * Omegle * Stickam References External links * Category:Chat websites Category:Internet properties established in 2009 Category:Russian inventions Category:Russian websites ","title":"Chatroulette"},{"id":"26190386","text":"First Colored Baptist Church may refer to: * First Colored Baptist Church (Bowling Green, Kentucky), listed on the NRHP in Warren County, Kentucky * First Colored Baptist Church (Memphis, Tennessee), listed on the NRHP in Shelby County, Tennessee ","title":"First Colored Baptist Church"},{"id":"26190392","title":"2010 Morocco Tennis Tour ‚Äì Tanger"},{"id":"26190408","text":"Fowlkes may refer to: *Alan Fowlkes (born 1958), retired professional baseball player *Charles Fowlkes (1916‚Äì1980), American baritone saxophonist *Curtis Fowlkes, American jazz trombonist *David Fowlkes, Jr. (born 1970 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin), the inventor of the Spinner *Eddie Fowlkes (born 1962), techno DJ from Detroit, Michigan *Herman Fowlkes, Jr. (1919‚Äì1993), American jazz musician and educator from Chicago, Illinois *Lauren Fowlkes (born 1988), American soccer player from Lee's Summit, Missouri *Tremaine Fowlkes (born 1976), American professional basketball player *Will Fowlkes (born 1967), American political activist ","title":"Fowlkes"},{"id":"26190412","text":"Maru Sankaku Shikaku were a Japanese rock band credited for being one of Japan's earliest psychedelic groups.

It is a small community west of the city of Watervliet and is inaccessible to the rest of Colonie by car without driving through Watervliet. Town historian Jean Olton stated in 1987 that Mannsville was no longer considered \\"an official hamlet\\" of the Town of Colonie. As of 2019, Mannsville (misspelled as Mansville) is listed on the Town of Colonie's Town Historian website as an unincorporated community within the Town of Colonie. History In 1875, Francis N. Mann purchased most of what is now Mannsville from John Schuyler. Mann was a judge in the Town of Watervliet (not to be confused with the neighboring city of Watervliet). He died a few months later, and his children- Francis N. Mann Jr., Elias P. Mann and Emily Mann inherited the land. In 1905 they moved to England without disposing of the land or arranging for the property taxes to be paid. Albany County eventually foreclosed, auctioning the land off in lots leading to a boom in new housing in the 1970s. In 1998, the neighboring city of Watervliet attempted to annex the small hamlet, which at that time consisted of roughly 175 inhabitants. Colonie Town Supervisor Mary Brizzell stated the pros for staying with Colonie as being- lower taxes, access to the town golf course, youth services, and community development grant money. Watervliet Mayor Robert Carlson put forth in favor of annexation the facts that emergency and fire response times would improve, the city provides municipal garbage pick up, does not charge a fire district tax (Colonie does), the children of Mannsville already attend the Watervliet City School District, and most residents attend Watervliet churches. Geography Mannsville is roughly in area. Mannsville is generally understood to be bordered on the south by NY Route 155; on the north by 15th Street and the Watervliet city line; on the east by Elbow Alley, which runs between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and Watervliet city line; and on the west by railroad tracks. Mannsville is flat and of low elevation. Since, 1995 residents have complained of frequent flooding due partly to beaver dams on the Kromma Kill and to increased residential construction uphill and upstream from the hamlet.

He joined the Haganah at age 15. In 1940 he moved to Ein Harod and joined the Palmach the following year. He became an officer in the Palmach. 1947 During early 1947 Kelman was ordered by the Haganah High Command to supervise the execution and burial of a Jew accused of collaborating with the British. The execution took place at Kibbutz Dafna. With the outbreak of the 1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, Kelman was a senior member of the Palmach. Following the Al-Khisas raid, 18 December 1947, when a woman member of the Palmach refused to throw a grenade into a room in which she could hear a child crying, Kelman argued that women should not be used on front line duties but should be used as \\"cooks and service people.\\"Kurzman. p.65 1948 On 15 February 1948, Kelman led a force of 60 men which attacked the remote village Sa'sa', in the Upper Galilee. The operation coincided with a number of other attacks on Arab targets.

Necrotizing periodontal diseases are a type of inflammatory periodontal (gum) disease caused by bacteria (notably fusobacteria and spirochaete species). The diseases appear to represent different severities or stages of the same disease process, although this is not completely certain. These diseases usually have a sudden onset, and so the term acute is often added to the diagnosis. The mildest on the spectrum is necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), followed by the successively more severe conditions necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP), necrotizing stomatitis and finally cancrum oris (noma), which is frequently fatal. Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis: painful, bleeding, sloughing ulceration and loss of the interdental papillae (usually of the lower front teeth). Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, (NUG), or simply necrotizing gingivitis (NG), is a common, non-contagious infection of the gums. Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is the acute presentation of NUG, which is the usual course the disease takes. If improperly treated NUG may become chronic and/or recurrent. In developed countries, ANUG occurs mostly in young adults with predisposing factors such as psychological stress, sleep deprivation, poor oral hygiene, smoking, immunosuppression and/or malnutrition. In developing countries, ANUG occurs mostly in malnourished children. Due to shared predisposing factors in a population (e.g. students during a period of examinations, armed forces recruits) ANUG is known to occur in epidemic-type patterns. This has led to the popular belief that ANUG is contagious, but this is not the case. The main features of NUG are painful, bleeding gums and ulceration and necrosis of the interdental papilla. There may also be intra-oral halitosis, cervical lymphadenitis (swollen lymph nodes in the neck) and malaise. Treatment of the acute disease is by debridement and antibiotics, usually metronidazole. Poor oral hygiene and other predisposing factors may need to be corrected to prevent recurrence. ANUG is also known as trench mouth, as it was observed to occur in the mouths of front line soldiers during World War I. Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP, or simply necrotizing periodontitis, NP) or acute necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (ANUP) is where the infection leads to attachment loss (destruction of the ligaments anchoring teeth in their sockets), but involves only the gingiva, periodontal ligament and alveolar ligament. Usually this spectrum of diseases result in loss of attachment, and therefore many ANUG diagnoses may be technically termed NUP, although ANUG is the term in most common use. NUP may be an extension of NUG into the periodontal ligaments, although this is not completely proven. In the meantime, NUG and NUP are classified together under the term necrotizing periodontal diseases. Necrotizing stomatitis Progression of NUP into tissue beyond the mucogingival junction characterizes necrotizing stomatitis, which has many features in similar with cancrum oris. Cancrum oris Cancrum oris (noma) in an adult male. Note destruction of orofacial tissues. Cancrum oris (also termed noma) is a necrotizing and destructive infection of the mouth and face, and therefore not strictly speaking a periodontal disease. In modern times, this condition usually occurs in malnourished children in developing countries. It may be disfiguring and is frequently fatal. It has been suggested that all cases of cancrum oris develop from pre-existing NUG, but this is not confirmed. Furthermore, the vast majority of cases of NUG and NUP will not progress to the more severe forms, even without treatment.

Biography A native Thracian, John first appears in history as a general in Roman Armenia in 579, along with Cours. If not already holding the post of magister militum per Armeniam at that time, he had been elevated to it by 582, when he was named magister militum per Orientem by the newly crowned Maurice. Soon after this, possibly in autumn 582, he fought a major pitched battle with the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan near the junction of the rivers Nymphius (modern Batman) and Tigris. In this battle, John commanded the center, while his old colleague Cours commanded the right wing and general Ariulf the left wing. Initially the battle went well, the center and left pushing the Persians back, but Cours did not follow up, allegedly due to his jealousy of John, causing the East Roman army to retreat in defeat.; . After another defeat during an unsuccessful siege of the fort Acbas, he was replaced (in late 583) by Philippicus.. In 587, he was briefly entrusted with command in Thrace against the Avars after their defeat and capture of the local commander Castus. John successfully relieved the Avar siege of Adrianople after defeating them in battle, but refused to pursue them out of caution. By 589, he was back in command in Armenia as magister militum, a post he held until a few years after the 591 peace with Persia, when relieved by Heraclius the Elder. At about the same time, he was raised to the rank of patricius.. In 589, he laid siege to the Armenian capital Dvin, but raised it when he heard of the rebellion of general Bahram Chobin against the Persian shah, Hormizd IV (r. 579‚Äì590). Taking advantage of the Persian infighting, he raided into Persian-held Azerbaijan, carrying off much booty and many captives. In 591, he took part in the joint Roman‚ÄìPersian campaign under Narses to restore Khosrau II (r. 590‚Äì628), the rightful Persian ruler, to his throne. At the head of his Armenian troops, he fought in the decisive Battle of Blarathon, which signalled the final defeat of the usurper Bahram.

It stars Xavier Samuel, Bobby Morley, Georgina Haig and Sophie Lowe.Road Train at Lightning Entertainment  Plot  Marcus (Xavier Samuel), his best friend Craig (Bobby Morley), and their friends, Liz (Georgina Haig) and Nina (Sophie Lowe) are driving through the Australian outback, when a road train comes up behind their SUV and pushes them off the road, breaking Craig's arm. The truck stops some distance up the road. The group approach it, but the driver is nowhere to be found. Distant gunshots are heard, and a crazed figure in the bush screams and runs towards them. Panicked, they commandeer the truck and drive away. The truck's radio turns on by itself. After all four fall asleep, the truck drives itself off the road and up a hill. When they wake up, Nina looks after Craig while Liz leaves to search for a shack she's seen. Unable to start the truck, Marcus accompanies Liz. Nina discovers the truck's fuel tanks are empty, but finds a large pipe underneath the trailer, filled with a mysterious red fluid. Craig, tormented by visions of the hellhound Cerberus, finds a key to the trailers. He opens and enters the rearmost trailer, only for the door to close itself behind him. Marcus and Liz have a disagreement over her having slept with Craig, causing Liz to storm off. Marcus stays on the road and has a run-in with the truck's driver, who shoots himself. Liz locates the rundown shack, where she finds unlabeled cans containing the red fluid. Thirsty, she drinks some, but quickly runs back to the truck after finding bloody remains. Liz and Nina try to start the truck, but Marcus, now bearing the driver's clothes and gun, tries to destroy it. The women overpower and tie him up. Craig emerges from the trailer and kills Marcus. The truck starts up again, and Nina tries to back it up. Liz stands at the rear to signal Nina, but eventually leaves to drink more red fluid. Nina, unable to see Liz, exits the cab and sees Craig, who tries to lure her into the rear trailer. Hearing Liz crying for help from inside, she pushes Craig in and locks the door. Eventually, after Nina turns the truck around, she stops and examines the front trailer. To her horror, she discovers it is an abattoir where human bodies, including Marcus's, are ground into the red fluid that fuels the truck. Shocked, she returns to the cab and keeps driving. Nina spots a car and signals them for help. The truck radio turns on again, distracting Nina long enough to allow Craig and Liz to break into the cab. As the three fight, Craig rams the truck into the car. Liz is thrown from the cab by Nina, who is then knocked out. When Nina awakens, she finds Craig dragging Liz's body to the trailer. He tries to persuade her to help, rambling of a \\"magnificent opportunity\\". Nina instead flees, but Craig slams her head on the side of the cab. He drags her into the trailer, but she manages to defend herself and flees into the bush. Craig pursues and catches Nina, but she kills him with the truck driver's gun. As Nina emerges from the bush, she spots the couple from the wrecked car examining the truck. She runs toward them, screaming warnings. The couple, having been run off the road, hearing distant gunshots, and seeing a screaming figure running towards them, commandeer the truck and drive off, leaving Nina to watch in horror as the bloody cycle repeats itself.

The Council reaffirmed its position on Cyprus, most recently in its Resolution 649 (1990) regarding the establishment of an independent, non-aligned, bi- communal federation without a union with another country. It called upon the parties involved to fully adhere to the aforementioned principles, requesting their co-operation with the Secretary-General and noting his intention to resume negotiations in November 1991 to complete an overall framework agreement. The best way to do this, the Council felt, was to consider a high- level international meeting chaired by the Secretary-General in which the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus, along with Greece and Turkey would participate. The resolution ended by requesting the Secretary-General to report on whether sufficient progress had been made to convene the high-level meeting and to convey the development of the \\"Set of Ideas\\".

It is widely known that he did so out of admiration, and devotion to Paul McCartney (most often self-doctored from right-handed basses, reengineered and played upside down, by Gagliardi himself). Gagliardi was on the albums Foreigner and Double Vision, but was fired from the band in 1979. In 1981, Gagliardi formed the band Spys with former Foreigner keyboardist Al Greenwood, a band that set the tone for much of the 80's synth-rock bands, and received acclaim within the musical community.

In 2012, the group along with the Southern Republican Leadership Conference organized a presidential debate that aired on CNN. Along with various other conservative and libertarian organizations the Tea Party Patriots have developed a Contract from America that echoes the Republican Contract with America of 1994 stating some of the core principles and several specific goals shared by organizations and individuals involved with the tea parties.

America's Frontline Doctors video  On July 27, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tea Party Patriots hosted and funded a press conference in Washington, D.C., in front of the Supreme Court Building by a group who referred to themselves as \\"America's Frontline Doctors\\". Without peer-reviewed evidence, the group of doctors claimed that hydroxychloroquine, Zithromax, and zinc could be used as a \\"cure\\" for COVID-19 (although there is currently no drug approved for this by the FDA or WHO) and that public health measures designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (such as business and school closures and mandatory face masks in public spaces) were therefore unnecessary. One of the speakers, Stella Immanuel, said she herself had treated and cured 350 COVID-19 patients using the promoted drug cocktail and referred to doctors refusing to use hydroxychloroquine as being like the \\"good Germans who allow the Nazis to kill the Jews\\". They also accused \\"fake pharma companies\\" of sponsoring studies that found hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective against COVID-19. The event was live streamed by the far-right website Breitbart News, and video of the event was shared on social media platforms such as Facebook groups (including those dedicated to anti- vaccination and conspiracy movements) and on Twitter ‚Äî where President Donald Trump (who has also promoted the drugs) and his son Donald Trump Jr. both shared versions of the video.

It consists of a cylindrical horizontal shell with a cylindrical furnace and fire-tubes within this. Their name derives from the boiler's popular use at one time for small steam yachts and launches. They have also been used in some early Naval torpedo boat destroyers.  Description  End- on view of the furnace, showing the small steam space above The cylindrical furnace or firebox fits entirely within the boiler's outer shell. Unlike the locomotive boiler, there is no firebox grate emerging beneath the main boiler. The boiler has similarities with both the locomotive boiler (the multiple small fire-tubes), and the Scotch marine boiler (the short cylindrical furnace). As a fire-tube boiler it has generous heating area and so is an effective steamer. Firebox construction is also simpler, thus cheaper, than for the locomotive firebox. As the circular furnace is largely self-supporting against boiler pressure, it did not require the extensive and costly stays of the locomotive boiler. This also allowed the boiler to be made with a bolted joint in the outer shell and so the whole furnace and tube nest could be withdrawn for inspection and maintenance. The firebox is of limited size though, and unlike the locomotive boiler cannot expand beyond the size of the boiler shell. This limits the sustained output that is possible. The grate and ashpan are also limited in size, the grate being a set of bars part-way across the furnace tube and the ashpan the restricted space beneath this. These features limit the boiler's ability to burn hard bituminous coal and they require a supply of Welsh steam coal, or similar, instead. Firing with wood or biomass fuels was difficult. Firebox capacity is further restricted by the space used for the ashpan and also by the dry-back furnace. The small ashpan also restricts their ability to steam for long periods. One drawback of the boiler was the large diameter of the furnace relative to the boiler shell, and thus the small steam space above the crown of the furnace. This made the boilers prone to priming, particularly on a rough sea, where water could be carried over into the steam pipe. A more serious danger was the limited reserve of the water level, where the water level had only to drop by a small amount owing to inattention before the furnace crown would be exposed, with likely overheating and risk of boiler explosion. The boiler was safe when correctly fired, but could not be left unattended. These water level restrictions became even more troublesome when the boiler was tilted, even by as little as a steep railway line. An unusual rate of wear and number of replacement furnaces supplied for the Heywood locomotives has been put down to this cause. The boiler did see some popularity in mainland Europe, as a boiler for small portable engines. A similar boiler, but arranged with return fire- tubes, was built in America as the Huber boiler.  Bagnall boiler  Early semi-portable engine, 1860s, with enlarged furnace To reduce the limitations of the small furnace, an enlarged form was developed. The area of the boiler shell alongside the furnace was enlarged in diameter, but remained circular. This permitted a larger diameter of furnace to be fitted. The firebox section of the shell was offset downwards, so that the tube nest from the upper part of the furnace was in the lowest, water-filled, portion of the shell. As the plates were still cylindrical they did not require stays, but there may have been a few small rod stays to support the flat part of the throatplate between the two sections of the shell. This boiler design was used for semi-portable engines from the 1860s. As the wider grate allowed the burning of poor fuels, such as straw or sugarcane waste, it was favoured for agricultural use and was widely known as the 'colonial' type. Marshalls built many of these and patented the design as their 'Britannia' firebox. This was also offered in a lengthened form as a log-burning furnace, particularly for use in Australia and Africa where forest land was being clear-felled for agriculture. All- circular launch boilers (rather than locomotive boilers) were not widely used in coal-rich Britain, apart from these enlarged types. They were sometimes known as 'marine' boilers, although this enlarged form was not favoured for marine use, owing to its raised centre of gravity.  Bagnall railway locomotives  contractor's loco The enlarged circular firebox was also used by W.G. Bagnall for narrow-gauge locomotives, from 1890. One of the last of these to be built, the last industrial narrow-gauge steam locomotive to be built for use in the UK, was Monarch, an articulated locomotive built for an industrial railway in Kent in 1953. This was one of a batch built for sugar plantation railways in South Africa, although it is slightly larger at itself. These were articulated to Bagnall's modified Meyer design. The original Meyer locomotive used two articulated bogies beneath a tank locomotive frame carrying the boiler and water tanks. This limited the space available for the firebox, a disadvantage which could be avoided, for small locos, by the use of Bagnall's boiler with a circular firebox entirely above the frames.  Railway locomotives  Locomotive Effie on Sir Arthur Heywood's Duffield Bank Railway Dot, from the Gorton Foundry works railway Launch-type boilers were only rarely used for railway locomotives, although they were notably used by Sir Arthur Heywood from 1874 for his minimum gauge railways at Duffield Bank and Eaton Hall. Other minimum gauge railways, notable the gauge works railways at Crewe, Horwich and the Guinness brewery in Dublin, also used launch-type boilers, owing to the limited space between the frames for a conventional firebox. Heywood-designed Ursula at the Perrygrove Railway, showing the limited grate and ashpan size. A limitation of this design for steam locomotives was the need to fit fire, grate and ashpan all within the confined circular furnace tube. This limited the radiative heating surface of the furnace, and thus the immediate steam-raising power of the boiler. They were noted as being slower to light from cold than conventional. As the ashpan space beneath the grate was small, locomotives could only operate for a short time before needing to rake out this ashpan. On a main line railway this would have required a return to the engine shed. On small narrow gauge contractor lines, the ash would simply be dumped wherever convenient and so this was much less of a drawback.  Conical boilers  Hohenzollern N¬∫ 447 In 1888 the Hohenzollern Locomotive Works delivered the first two narrow gauge Feldbahn locomotives for the Prussian Army. These used a conical development of the launch boiler. A backplate of enlarged diameter and a greatly reduced smokebox tubeplate were fitted into a steeply conical shell. This was installed with the upper edge of the cone horizontal. The purpose of the conical shape was to increase water depth over the furnace, the hottest part of the evaporative surface. The furnace and tubes were moved to the lower part of the shell, with the tubes running upwards parallel to the lower edge of the cone. A difficulty was the boiler's lack of steam space, requiring an enlarged dome, of almost as much capacity as the main shell. As a major virtue of the launch boiler is the simplicity of its construction, rolling a conical shell and fitting a large dome represented a considerable increase in their complexity and cost. These locomotives, and their boilers, were a complete failure. They were undersized and underpowered for the task, with tiny wheels prone to derailment on uneven track and (for the first 2-2-2 locomotive) limited adhesion from its single driver. Despite being some years after Heywood and the publication of his Minimum Gauge Railways, they ignored almost all of Heywood's principles. The boilers lacked evaporative capacity and could not support sustained running.  Lentz boiler  A large launch-type boiler with a corrugated furnace, described as the Lentz boiler, was fitted to the first Heilmann steam-electric locomotive La Fus√©e Electrique of 1890. The boiler design was German in origin. A similar boiler, the 'Vanderbilt' was used in the USA.  Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway  L&YR; 0-8-0 with cylindrical furnace The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway suffered problems with firebox stays, leading to a boiler explosion with an 0-8-0 'Class 30' near Knottingley in 1901 Their Chief Mechanical Engineer Henry Hoy, sought to avoid the problems of the stayed firebox altogether and so developed an alternative boiler and firebox. This used a corrugated tubular furnace and cylindrical outer firebox, as for the Lentz. Such corrugated furnaces were already in widespread use locally, with the Lancashire and Galloway stationary boilers of the Lancashire cotton mills and local makers already had several designs available. The furnace was also of steel, rather than the copper used for fireboxes at this time. Hoy's involvement was ironic, as a major cause of the original accident had been Hoy's invention of a new brass alloy for firebox stays, an inelastic alloy that turned out to have serious drawbacks. One Class 30, 396, was rebuilt in 1903 and 20 more were built new with this boiler. In service the boilers showed a number of drawbacks. They were slow to warm up after lighting and the limited ashpan space limited their working time away from the shed. Both of these were as a result of the furnace heating area largely being shielded by the grate across it. It has been suggested that they would have been more successful with oil firing, as this would have allowed the whole furnace diameter to have been used and would have avoided ash build up. The new boiler design did not last long in service and the locomotives were rebuilt with conventional boilers after ten years. Hoy's successor, George Hughes, described these boilers unfavourably in papers read to the I. Mech E..  NZR E class  Corrugated furnace of the NZR E class Boiler of the NZR E class The single NZR E class of 1906 was an experimental Vauclain compound articulated 2-6-6-0T Mallet, intended for working the Rimutaka Incline. Compounding encouraged the choice of the then remarkably high boiler pressure of , which required a strong firebox construction. The NZR chief draughtsman G. A. Pearson chose a corrugated furnace design in a tapered boiler, similar to the Vanderbilt.

The battle occurred during Operation Rolling Stone, an American security operation to protect engineers building a tactically important road in the vicinity of Tan Binh, in central Binh Duong Province, north-west of Bien Hoa airbase. During the fighting, soldiers from the US 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR), which had been attached for the operation, fought off a regimental-sized Viet Cong night assault. Repulsed by massed firepower from artillery and tanks, the Viet Cong suffered heavy casualties and were forced to withdraw by morning. After the attack, the Americans and Australians made no attempt to pursue the Viet Cong, focusing on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties. The Viet Cong continued to harass the American sappers with occasional sniper and mortar fire, but these tactics proved ineffective, and the road was completed by 2 March. Background Military situation During February 1966, as part of an American road- building program designed to challenge the Viet Cong's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon, the US 1st Engineer Battalion‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent‚Äîhad been engaged in constructing an all- weather road between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province, west of Ben Cat, on the northern apex of the Viet Cong base area known as the Iron Triangle. This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C, the Mekong Delta, the Iron Triangle and War Zone D, while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government. In response to the American moves, Viet Cong Local Force elements began harassing the sappers, subjecting them daily to sniping, laying mines and carrying out sabotage in an effort to hamper construction. A large American security operation known as Operation Rolling Stone was subsequently launched by elements of US 1st Division on 11 February, in an area of operations approximately north-west of Bien Hoa airbase. The US 1st Brigade under the command of Colonel Edgar N. Glotzbach was allocated the task, and he assigned one of his three battalions to guard the engineers on a rotating basis, while the other two would probe the Viet Cong positions nearby in order to keep them off balance. Meanwhile, following a request from the American divisional commander, 1 RAR‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece‚Äîwas detached from the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and placed under the operational command of the US 1st Division until 5 March. Major General William E. DePuy had selected the Australians specifically because of their reputation for dispersed, aggressive patrolling. Attached to support the infantry from 1 RAR were Australian M113s from 1 APC Troop, engineers from 3 Field Troop, Bell Sioux light observation helicopters and Cessna 180 fixed- wing aircraft from 161st Independent Reconnaissance Flight, and L5 Pack Howizters from 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery. Prelude Opposing forces Headquarters US 1st Brigade was located about east of the engineer base camp in the vicinity of the hamlet of Tan Binh, just north of the new roadway and less than west of Route 16. The brigade's constituent battalions were widely dispersed carrying out search and destroy operations, and the area of operations was only lightly defended. Nevertheless, except for the harassment faced by the engineers, contact between the Americans and the Viet Cong had been infrequent during the first weeks of the operation. While US and Australian forces possessed only limited details regarding the location of Viet Cong Main Force regiments, Australian intelligence assessed that a minimum of two Local Force platoons, and possibly a Local Force company, were operating in the area but cautioned commanders that the Viet Cong probably had the ability to concentrate a Main Force battalion in the area with little warning. The concept of operations required the Australians to protect the engineer base, the laterite pit and road work parties over a distance of , as well as protecting engineer reconnaissance parties when they moved forward to plan new sections of the road. New Zealand gunners in Vietnam. On 19 February, 1 RAR was inserted by helicopter, taking over from 2nd Battalion, US 38th Infantry Regiment. Preece immediately instituted a program of twenty-four-hour dispersed patrolling, and within two days this had succeeded in reducing the level of Viet Cong activity against the road construction. Two platoons of American M48 Patton tanks were also moved into the area, patrolling by day with the Australian armoured personnel carriers, while securing the laterite pit at night. Several contacts took place and by 22 February the Australians began to suspect that a major attack on them was being planned, noting that they were now facing Main Force elements. In the early morning of 23 February three Viet Cong soldiers were killed in an Australian ambush, while several others were wounded but escaped. The dead soldiers were well equipped with new AK-47 assault rifles and webbing, and they were identified as being from 761st Main Force Regiment. Also captured was a large quantity of ammunition, rations and medical supplies. Later that night a North Vietnamese engineer officer was also killed in a separate ambush, adding further weight to the Australian suspicions. As dawn broke the next day, two half-platoon ambushes from B Company, 1 RAR‚Äîunder the command of Major Ian McFarlane‚Äîengaged two squads of Viet Cong Main Force. Preece immediately warned Glotzbach of an imminent attack, and then informed Sargent that the Australians were moving to set up a defensive position, recommending that the engineers relocate in order to join them. Meanwhile, to the west three battalions of Viet Cong 9th Division were massing for a decisive blow, preparing a regimental attack on the American and Australian positions. Units included J10 Battalion of the 761st Regiment, 707 Battalion of the 763rd Regiment and D800 Independent Battalion; in total around 2,000 men. By 20:00 they had completed a approach march and were in assembly areas near the village of Ap Bo, using local women and youths as porters to carry ammunition, equipment and supplies. Small reconnaissance parties moved forward as pathfinders, easily locating the American headquarters due to the large amount of noise and light it gave off. The Viet Cong regimental commander determined to attack on three separate axes from the east, and to then send a force around behind the Brigade Headquarters and assault from the west, thereby surrounding the defenders and preventing them from concentrating their forces in defence. Fire support was provided from two separate locations: with mortars deployed to the west, in between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade's headquarters, while mortars would fire from a position in Ap Bo to the south-east. Battle Night assault, 23/24 February 1966 Battle of Suoi Bong Trang, 23‚Äì24 February 1966. By late afternoon on 23 February 1 RAR had adopted a position in all-round defence in the vicinity of the Suoi Bong Trang, a major creek to the west of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters, while the US engineers had moved into a new defensive position inside the Australian perimeter. Meanwhile, alerted by the Australians, a platoon of M48 Patton tanks from Troop B, 1st Squadron, US 4th Cavalry Regiment and a second howitzer field battery from 1st Battalion, US 5th Artillery Regiment had been moved in to defend the Brigade Headquarters. 1st Battalion, US 26th Infantry Regiment‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Y.Y. Phillips‚Äîreturned from the field and also deployed in defence by last light, augmenting Company B, 1st Battalion, US 28th Infantry Regiment. Additional ammunition was also brought forward, in anticipation of a likely Viet Cong attack. At 22:00, soldiers from B Company, 1 RAR, occupying the western sector of the Australian perimeter noticed lights to their front. McFarlane subsequently requested artillery and mortar fire to target the location, but the request was declined by Preece. Meanwhile, a small Australian standing patrol that had deployed forward of the company main defensive position under the command of Private Walter Brunalli, observed the lights moving closer, east of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters. Two tanks had been positioned forward of the American positions, with a squad of infantry on the eastern approaches, and by midnight they had also reported sounds of movement and intermittent flashes of light through the trees. In the early morning of 24 February, just after midnight, sporadic firing was heard throughout the area. The forward American listening posts had detected small groups of Viet Cong moving outside the perimeter, killing two and forcing the remainder to withdraw into the darkness after one of the sentries opened fire. Glotzbach waited for the Viet Cong main effort, however, and withheld the bulk of the firepower at his disposal. With their defences alerted, the Americans and Australians \\"stood to\\" for the next 45 minutes. The battle began at 01:45 with a heavy barrage of Viet Cong mortar and small arms fire. The Americans responded with small arms, machine-guns, tank fire, mortars and artillery and over the next hour the firing grew in intensity until, at 03:00, the Viet Cong switched their fires to the north-west side of the American perimeter, augmenting their barrage with recoilless rifles. Glotzbach expected a full- scale ground assault, but the Viet Cong had been held back by the weight of American firepower, with heavy artillery including and howitzers firing in support from Phuoc Vinh, in addition to the defenders' own artillery, which was now firing over open sights after lowering their tubes to fire directly at the Viet Cong positions. In total eight field batteries were available. Elsewhere, the Australian standing patrol had remained in position despite the proximity of the Viet Cong, and with the Americans pouring massive fire into the area they were soon caught in the crossfire. Brunalli was subsequently wounded in the arm. Although the Australian position was not the focus of the attack, it too soon came under attack from mortars, killing an American sapper. With the base plate positioned between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade's headquarters there was initial confusion over the source of the rounds, and both Gloztbach and Preece accused the other of firing on their positions. However, after US aircraft arrived overhead to illuminate the battlefield the Australians were able to join the fighting, and they began firing at masses of Viet Cong who had become disorientated and were milling around on the battlefield. Earlier, a number of Australian ambushes had intercepted Viet Cong pathfinder groups and this had largely prevented the communists from conducting a final reconnaissance of their objectives. Unaware of the newly strengthened defences, they had assaulted into the combined firepower of two American field artillery batteries firing over open sights, as well as tanks supported by infantry. Using anti-personnel canister, flechette and splintex rounds, as well as prepositioned banks of Claymore mines, the Americans broke up several assaults with heavy casualties, while the Australians poured small arms fire into the flank of what was now turning into a costly and futile attack. Viet Cong withdraw, 24 February 1966 By 02:45 three Viet Cong soldiers had moved to within of Brunalli's standing patrol, taking up firing positions. The Australians killed one and wounded another who was dragged away by the third, before they withdrew to another location nearby. Meanwhile, the two American tanks forward of the US 1st Brigade's headquarters were overrun and their crews killed. Having suffered heavy losses, by 04:00 some of the Viet Cong began to retreat from the battlefield, and many were now filtering past 1 RAR. As groups of Viet Cong began to move past their position the standing patrol was now in an untenable position, clashing briefly with one group of 15 Viet Cong. McFarlane finally ordered the patrol to withdraw, so that he could engage with artillery and mortars. Moving to achieve a clean break, the patrol engaged another group of 10 Viet Cong with a volley of small arms fire, before withdrawing towards the company position in the darkness. Expecting to be followed up the Australians set up a snap ambush, killing another Viet Cong soldier before successfully completing the move back to their perimeter. American M48 Patton tank similar to those used at Tan Binh. With the Viet Cong line of withdrawal carrying them past the Australian position, heavy fire was maintained on them as they attempted a partial retreat, resulting in further casualties. However, as daybreak neared the Viet Cong lingered, unwilling to commit to an all-out attack, but also unwilling to completely withdraw. Finally, the main Viet Cong attack began at 05:30. Earlier losses had been heavy, though, and they were unable to concentrate in sufficient numbers to mount a massed assault. Instead only a series of disjointed attacks followed, none more than 40 men strong. By 06:45 these attacks had been repelled by the Americans and the Viet Cong withdrew before dawn, avoiding the arrival of additional American air support. Aftermath Casualties At first light the next morning Australian clearing patrols located 89 dead and 11 wounded Viet Cong in front of their positions. The bulk of the casualties had been inflicted by the Americans, but it was later determined that at least 17 Viet Cong had been killed by 1 RAR. Others had been disintegrated by artillery and tank fire and the battlefield was littered with shattered human remains, including severed limbs and chunks of flesh, while red pulp covered the rubber trees that were still standing. Later, 154 bodies were bulldozed into a B-52 bomb crater nearby, while it was estimated that a further 200 Viet Cong casualties had been removed from the battlefield. Fifteen Viet Cong had also been captured during the battle, as had a large quantity of equipment, including small arms and ammunition, crew- served weapons and grenades. The villagers of Ap Bo were again used by the Viet Cong to carry many of the dead and wounded from the battlefield with ox carts, and they also suffered a number of casualties from artillery and mortar fire landing in the area. In contrast, American casualties were limited, consisting of 11 killed and 72 wounded. Australian casualties were lighter still, with just two men wounded. One American tank had also been destroyed, while two tanks and four armoured personnel carriers were damaged. Overall, the commander of the combined US-Australian force believed that they had won an impressive victory, but his troops were exhausted and with ammunition running low, Glotzbach decided not to pursue the withdrawing force. Instead, the Americans and Australians focused on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties. Subsequent operations Australian soldiers examining captured Viet Cong equipment during Operation Rolling Stone. For the next two days, the Australians continued to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program in an attempt to consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing basic health care to the local population. Despite such efforts though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the local population. On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D. At the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the threat against Saigon subsided. General William Westmoreland, commander of US forces in Vietnam, planned to adopt a more offensive strategy, and between January and December 1966 US troop levels rose from 210,000 to 327,000. The Australian government also increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade‚Äîthe 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)‚Äîwith armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.

It provides an account of the Songhay Empire from the reign of Sonni Ali (ruled 1464-1492) up to 1599 with a few references to events in the following century. The chronicle also mentions the earlier Mali Empire. It and the Tarikh al-Sudan, another 17th century chronicle giving a history of Songhay, are together known as the Timbuktu Chronicles. The French scholars Octave Houdas and Maurice Delafosse published a critical edition in 1913. It has been argued that this edition conflates the text from an early incomplete manuscript with that of a re-written forgery produced early in the 19th century. The Tarikh was originally believed to have been written by Mahmud Kati but this has been questioned and Ibn al-Mukhtar, a grandson of Mahmud Kati, is now believed to have been the author. Discovery and publication During his visit to Timbuktu in 1895 the French journalist F√©lix Dubois learnt of the chronicle but was unable to obtain a copy.. Dubois gave the title as Fatassi. Most copies of the manuscript had been destroyed early in the 19th century by the order of the FulaIn ; in . leader Seku Amadu, but in 1911 an old manuscript was located in Timbuktu that was missing some of the initial pages. A copy was made and sent to the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris (MS No. 6651).. The original Timbuktu version is designated as Manuscript A while the copy is Manuscript B. A year later a seemingly complete manuscript was located in Kayes. A copy of this manuscript, which includes the name of an author, Mahmud Kati, is designated as Manuscript C. As well as the initial chapter, Manuscript C contains various additions and deletions compared to Manuscript A.; After Octave Houdas and Maurice Delafosse had completed a translation of the Tarikh al-fattash they received a further manuscript that had been acquired by the French traveller Albert Bonnel de M√©zi√®res in Timbuktu in September 1913. The preface of this anonymous 24 page document announced that it was written at the request of Askiya Darwud b. Harun. He is known to have reigned in Timbuktu between 1657 and 1669. The text of the manuscript is closely related to the Tarikh al-fattash and presents similar material in a similar order. It includes an introduction which differs from that in Manuscript C, followed by text that is either identical to Manuscript A or is an abridged version of that contained in Manuscript A, missing many of the details. In 1913 Houdas and Delafosse published a critical edition of the Arabic text of the Tarikh al-fattash together with a translation into French. In the volume containing the French translation they included, as Appendix 2, a translation into French of the unique portions of the 24 page manuscript. However, the corresponding Arabic text was not included in the volume containing the Arabic text of the other manuscripts. Difficulties with the text There are some obvious problems with the text published by Houdas and Delafosse. The biographical information for Mahmud Kati (in Manuscript C only) suggests that he was born in 1468, while the other important 17th century chronicle, the Tarikh al-Sudan, gives the year of his death (or someone with the same name) as 1593. This would correspond to an age of 125 years. In addition, there are prophecies made in the initial chapter (Manuscript C only) concerning the coming of the last of the twelve caliphs predicted by Muhammad. He will be Ahmad of the (Fulani) Sangare tribe in Massina. Seku Amadu belonged to this tribe and thus the prophecy was fulfilled. In 1971 the historian Nehemia Levtzion published an article in which he argued that Manuscript C was a forgery produced during the time of Seku Amadu in the first quarter of the 19th century. He suggested that the real author of the manuscript (Manuscript A) was Ibn al-Mukhtar, a grandson of Mahmud Kati and that the chronicle was probably written soon after 1664. Levtzion also suggested that the text included as Appendix 2 of the French translation might correspond to an earlier version of Manuscript A, before the manuscript was expanded by members of the Kati family. Unfortunately the modern study of the Tarikh al-fattash is handicapped by the disappearance of the Arabic manuscript corresponding to Appendix 2 of the French translation. In 2015 based upon analysis of other manuscripts not explored by previous researchers, professor of African history Mauro Nobili and others argued that the work published by Houdas and Delafosse is in fact a conflation of two separate works, that he names the Tarikh Ibn al-Mukhtar, being the chronicle written by Ibn al-Mukhtar, and the actual Tarikh al-fattash, being Appendix 2 of Houdas' and Delafosse's Chronique de Chercher and called the Notice Historique by professor Paulo Fernando de Moraes Farias in earlier work from 2008 plus the text of MS A and MS B used by Houdas and Delafosse. Origin of the Kingdom of Mali The Soninke author of Ta'rikh al-Fattash, Ibn al- Mukhtar, recorded the oral tradition surrounding the origin of the Mali kingdom four hundred years earlier. He states: \\"The kingdom of Mali rose to power only after the fall of the kingdom of Kaya-Magha, ruler of the whole western region. Until then the king of Mali was merely one of the vassals of the Kaya-Magha, one of his officials and ministers. Kaya-Mahga in the Wa'Kore (Soninke) language means 'king of gold'. ... The name of Kaya-Magha's capital was Qunbi.\\" Notes References  Volume 1 is the Arabic text, Volume 2 is a translation into French. Reprinted by Maisonneuve in 1964 and 1981.

In other words, the highest signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved in a given amount of time. This relationship was described by Richard R. Ernst, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Consider a single pulse sequence consisting of (1) an excitation pulse with flip angle \\\\theta_E, (2) the recording of the time domain signal (Free induction decay, FID) for a duration known as acquisition time a_t, and (3) a delay until the next excitation pulse (here called interpulse delay d_1). This sequence is repeated back-to-back many times and the sum or the average of all recorded FIDs (\\"transients\\") is calculated. If the longitudinal relaxation time T_1 of the specific spin in question is short compared to the sum of a_t and d_1, the spins (or the spin ensembles) are fully or close to fully relaxed. Then a 90¬∞ flip angle will yield the maximum signal intensity (or signal-to-noise ratio) per number of averaged FIDs. For shorter intervals between excitation pulses compared to the longitudinal relaxation, partial longitudinal relaxation until the next excitation pulse leads to signal loss in the subsequent FID. This signal loss can be minimized by reducing the flip angle. The optimal signal-to-noise ratio for a given combination of longitudinal relaxation time and delay between excitation pulses is obtained at the Ernst angle \\\\cos(\\\\theta_E) = e^{-(d_1+a_t)/T_1} For example, to obtain the highest signal-to-noise ratio for a signal with d_1 + a_t set to match the signal's T_1, the optimal flip angle is 68¬∞. An NMR spectrum or an in vivo MR spectrum most of the time consists of signals of more than one spin species which can exhibit different longitudinal relaxation times. Therefore, the calculated Ernst angle may apply only to the selected one of the many signals in the spectrum and other signals may be less intense than at their own Ernst angle. In contrast in standard MRI, the detected signal of interest is predominantly that of a single spin species, the water 1H spins. This relationship is especially important in magnetic resonance imaging where the sum of interscan delay d_1 and acquisition time a_t is often short relative to the signal's T_1 value. In the MRI community, this sum is often known as repetition time T_R = d_1 + a_t, thus \\\\cos(\\\\theta_E)=e^{-T_R/T_1} and consequently \\\\theta_E=\\\\arccos\\\\left(e^{-\\\\frac{T_R}{T_1}}\\\\right).

This webpage cited This webpage also cited The Manx Sword of State is a ceremonial sword that represents the Tynwald on the Isle of Man. It represents the duties of the Sovereign of the Isle of Man, and is used every month in Tynwald, and annually during the Tynwald Day ceremony. There have been three swords used for such functions over the years. One is used for the ceremonies; one is housed in a museum; the other was lost in the 18th century. The Sword of State is popularly said to date to the mid 13th century, however it is not unlike 15th-century ceremonial swords used in England, and recent analysis dates it to the 15th century as well. Description The sword has a two-edged blade of steel long, slightly more than wide where it intersects the guard. The guard is a thin steel band inches long. The sword's hilt is made of hardwood, and measures inches to the pommel. The pommel is made of steel, flattened on both sides, and measures about in diameter. Both sides of the pommel are surmounted with shields bearing the spurred Three Legs of Man. This webpage is transcription of the following monograph: Function The sword is the symbol of the Tynwald, which is said to be the oldest continuous parliament in the world. The sword signifies the duty of the Sovereign of the Isle of Man, who through the Tynwald, is bound to protect and defend the Manx people from their foes. Without the sword, the Tynwald cannot be deemed to be properly constituted. The sword is used at the Tynwald Day sitting at St Johns, and is carried in front of the Lieutenant Governor in a procession. It is also used whenever the Tynwald sits in the Legislative Chambers, in Douglas. When the Tynwald is not sitting, a replica sword is on display. There have been three such swords over the years ‚Äì one is used in parliamentary functions every month in Tynwald, and annually on Tynwald Day; another is housed in the Manx Museum; the third was lost in the mid 18th century. History The Sword of State is popularly attributed to Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles, who reigned from 1229-1237. This document is a revised version of a monograph published in 1999, see footnotes in document for details.Kinvig 1975: pp. 91-92. Similar examples of ceremonial swords are those used in the English cities of Chester, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne; both of which date to the mid 15th century. Recent analysis of the Manx sword has determined that it is also a 15th-century design, and probably made in London. The blade itself is thought to have been fitted in the late 16th century, or 17th century. It is possible that the sword was made for the 1422 Tynwald meeting that was attended by Sir John Stanley.

Through its descriptions of virtual topics in business, marketing techniques associated with window product display, and the use of windows as fashionable parts of residential spaces, the book is considered a seminal work on minute advertising procedures and home decor techniques exercised in late-19th-century Europe. Through a lack of general reprinting, the work is considered extremely rare.

The first edition of A Guide to Window-Dressing is designated with the OCLC number 39203562.  Background  According to the original 1883 text, A Guide to Window-Dressing was first published earlier that year in a local periodical, The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal. The journal article was written and submitted anonymously, the book citing the periodical's headquarters as \\"London: office of 'The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal,' 148 and 149, Aldersgate Street, E.C.\\" The book adapted was published by the now defunct W H & L Collingridge publishing house, at the City Press located on the same street. The preface to the book states that it was created in response to numerous inquiries to the proprietors of The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal for a comprehensive work on window- dressing, and goes on to promote itself by stating the following: > \\"No such book in connection with the drapery trade has, so far as they [the > journal proprieters] are aware, been hitherto published, with the exception > of a small prize essay published several years ago in connection with the > same journal.\\" According to Google Books and a library stamp seen on its facsimile of the guide, an extant copy of the first edition was found in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, first placed in the library's collections on 9 March 1987.

It opened in 1978 with four anchor stores: JCPenney, Prange's, and Prange Way, with other additional stores. Shortly after the opening, Kohl's was added as the fourth anchor store at the mall. In 1990, the Prange Way location at the mall was closed. Stores The original anchor stores of Machesney Park Mall were JCPenney and H.C. Prange, later Younkers, then Bergner's. Prange Way, which later became Phar-Mor, and Kohl's were added in the 1980s. A Burlington Coat Factory store opened in the mall in September 2009. Despite announcement from JCPenney that it would close all of its outlet stores, representatives of the chain said that the Machesney Park store would remain open through 2012. On October 11, 2016, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Bergner's would be closing on January 31, 2017. Renovations Since being acquired by Rubloff Development Group in December 2003, the mall has been undergoing internal demolition in preparation for redevelopment. Practice Velocity, a medical software and billing company, moved into the former Kohl's in late 2013. On July 18, 2018 it was announced that PCI Pharma Services would move into the vacant JCPenney store.

Other dancers in the film were Pat Nixon and Marjorie Reynolds. Plot summary Set in Boston in the 1820s, the film tells of dancing teacher Jonathan Pride, shanghaied by pirates and forced to be a slave aboard his own ship. Jonathan is able to join a provisioning party that lands on the coast of California, then a part of the Spanish Empire where he makes his escape; his only possessions being his umbrella and music box that he uses for his dancing lessons. He is seen by a shepherd who warns the nearest town whose excitable population transform Jonathan's arrival into a full-fledged pirate invasion. The Alcalde Don Emilio Perena leads the militia into shooting up their own town whilst Jonathan is later captured in the boudoir of the Alcade's daughter Serafina. Jonathan is sentenced to death. When Serafina and the women of the town discover Jonathan's profession of dancing teacher, his execution is delayed until he teaches the waltz to the women of the town.

The genus name is derived from a combination of the Greek nanos (dwarf) and the snakefly genus Raphidia, and the type species name from the Latin electrum (amber) and Burma, the former name of Myanmar. The type species is known from the holotype, a single, partial adult, now deposited in the American Museum of Natural History as specimen number Bu-092., and several additional specimens. The amber specimen is from deposits in Tanai Village, Kachin State northwest of Myitkyina, Myanmar. The specimen has a badly disarticulated thorax and abdomen, which are present in the amber as integumental debris, however the head, wings, and anterior legs are in good condition. Nanoraphidia electroburmica is the smallest known Raphidioptera species, living or extinct, the fore wings being only long. The second species is named after the lithographic limestone of the La Pedrera de R√∫bies Formation in Spain where it was found. The genus is also the first to be described from a specimen of old world amber. Nanoraphidia is separatable from other Mesoraphidiidae genera by the small size of specimens and distinct vein structure of the wings. The wings have an expanded costal area which is similar in appearance to the costal areas in Cretinocellia and Lugala. Both of these genera, however, belong to the Baissopteridae family and have many more crossveins and cells between Rs and M veins. The specimen shows N. electroburmica to have had a brown coloration to the body and a hyaline appearance to the wings.

He played for Cornell University from 1905 to 1907 and was selected as a first- team All-American in both 1906 and 1907. Biography Thompson grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut and played three years of football at Andover. He was also a \\"weight man\\" for Andover's track team, competing in the hammer throw and shot put. Thompson was the captain of Andover's football team as a senior, and in April 1903, the Boston Evening Transcript reported that he had been \\"much sought after\\" due to \\"his splendid\\" work on the Andover football team. He initially committed to attend Yale University, but changed his mind and enrolled at Cornell University. He played at the guard position for Cornell football team from 1905 to 1907, and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1906 and 1907. He weighed \\"close to 250 pounds,\\" and The New York Times described him as \\"one of the largest men who ever played on a college gridiron.\\" Despite his large size, Thompson was also known for his speed as reflected in the following 1907 newspaper story: > \\"Big Elmer Thompson in the guise of a sprinter was the novel sight which the > enthusiasts at the football practice were treated to yesterday afternoon. > The Cornell left guard, who weighs about 220, surprised the coaches by the > way he got down under punts, sometimes beating out Van Osman, the fleet > end.\\" In 1927, the New York Sun named Thompson to its first-team list of the greatest football players in Cornell history. In explaining its selection, the Sun emphasized Thompson's ability to scatter the opposing team's line: > \\"Elmer Thompson's one weakness was his good-natured, easy-going temperament. > This burly, frizzle-haired blonde weighed 240 pounds‚Äîall of it solid bone > and muscle. Tommy loomed up like Gibraltar. He didn't make a hole in the > opposing line; he simply scattered it. His touseled yellow head gleamed > through the melee like Henry of Navarre's white plume.\\" In February 1908, Thompson was \\"dropped from the Cornell College of Law on account of deficiencies in his studies.\\" According to reports at the time, Thompson \\"was 'busted' out after failing to pass enough subjects at the close of the first term.\\" Thompson appealed his case in a petition to the faculty, but they refused to reopen his case. Under Cornell rules, Thompson lost his eligibility to play football at Cornell. After leaving Cornell, Thompson applied to President William Howard Taft to be a special Secret Service guard. In 1909 and 1910, he worked as the football coach for Polytechnic Preparatory High School in New York. In 1929, Thompson died at his home after a short illness. In 1955, Thompson was selected by The Cornell Daily Sun as one of two guards on Cornell's all-time football team.

A threaded rod, also known as a stud, is a relatively long rod that is threaded on both ends; the thread may extend along the complete length of the rod. They are designed to be used in tension. Threaded rod in bar stock form is often called all-thread.  Studs  Balilla engine with cylinder head removed, showing the studs that normally hold it in place Studs may have a drive slot in one end to facilitate installing the stud.  Types  'Waisted' or 'undercut' studs, as engine cylinder head retainers With respect to shape, stud bolts a.k.a. studs are categorized into three basic types: \\"fully threaded stud bolts\\", \\"tap end stud bolts\\", and \\"double end stud bolts\\". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme ends of the body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications. For studs that are not completely threaded, there are two types of studs: full- bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank. Undercut studs (rolled thread) are also stronger because the metal is \\"rolled\\" up to the major diameter, not removed. This preserves the grain of the steel, and in some cases even enhances it. Full bodied studs (cut thread) are weaker because metal is removed to create the thread, disturbing the grain of the steel. Undercut studs are only required in applications where the stud is exposed to fatigue. Cut threads are entirely suitable for many applications, even when rolled threads might be slightly stronger. Mass-produced fasteners (standard bolts and studs) are usually rolled, but jobbed parts with custom features and small lot sizes are likely to be cut.  Strength  The allowable tensile force for a non-undercut threaded rod is defined by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) as: :P = \\\\frac{0.33 F_u \\\\pi d^2}{4} where d is the nominal diameter and Fu is the ultimate tensile strength of the material. For undercut threaded rods the allowable tensile stress is defined as: :P = \\\\frac{0.6 F_y \\\\pi d_s^2}{4} where ds is the diameter of the shank and Fy is the yield strength of the material. Both equations give units of force for the result, i.e. pounds force or newtons.  Class  Metric threaded rods are marked on the end with a color code to define the ISO strength class.

But he regarded himself a pathologist and not an immunologist, so, he wanted other researchers of leprosy who came under him to complete it. Among other researchers, Fumio Hayashi completed it. Hayashi read a paper on it at a leprosy conference at Bangkok. Masao Ota, a dermatologist who also studied leprosy, was very much impressed by the paper, and tried to publish International Journal of Leprosy. Hayashi's paper was in its first issue.

Plot During the original game, the protagonists succeed in destroying the Chaos Engine, a time-travel device. Its creator, Baron Fortesque, appears to have been defeated. However, in The Chaos Engine 2, it transpires that he and the protagonists are all trapped within a temporal singularity created by the destruction of the Chaos Engine device. In order to survive they must assist the Baron in rebuilding the device, though only one of them will be able to escape the singularity. Gameplay Unlike its predecessor, The Chaos Engine 2 is a split-screen deathmatch between two players, one of which may be controlled by the computer: there is no co-operative mode available. Instead, each player must try to obtain the greatest score, either by simply killing the opponent repeatedly or by collecting objects, destroying monsters, fulfilling tasks and solving puzzles. Conversely, points are lost if killed. Inventories are dropped upon death, which means that if a quest requires a key to unlock a door or a safe, it becomes necessary to kill the opponent should they acquire it before the player. If a human opponent has the highest score at the end of a round, they move on to the next; if the computer defeats the player, the round is replayed until the user wins. A game can be played across 4, 8, 12 or 16 rounds, with each consisting of a different environment: Medieval, Aztec and Chaos. Characters The Chaos Engine 2 allows players to select one of four available characters. Each character has different attributes that define how quickly they move, how much health they begin with and their starting weapon. The four characters are: * The Gentleman * The Navvie * The Brigand * The Mercenary Abilities Initially, players are only able to obtain a limited selection of special abilities, but the range increases as they progress through each game: * Teleportion: transports the opponent to a designated spot. * Duplication: a free-moving clone of the player is created. * Freeze: stuns the opponent and any monsters on the screen. * Trap: allows a player to rig a door with explosives. * Sunglasses: enables a player to become invisible. Reception The Chaos Engine 2 was met with highly positive reviews. Amiga Computing commented that \\"the graphics are smooth and flowing, the action non-stop and there is a huge amount of playability.\\" In a similar vein, CU Amiga praised it as a \\"totally brilliant single or multi-player game.\\" Amiga Format criticized the difficulty of the single-player deathmatch against the computer, with the reviewer remarking that while it provided players with \\"plenty of challenge... the computer seemed to have way too much of an unfair advantage.\\" Amiga Power and The One both previewed the game in 1995 and 1996 respectively, but neither magazine survived to see it published.

After World War II, the aerodrome reverted to being the municipal airport for a while. The history of Wingfield is synonymous with the history of flight in South Africa, including pioneering attempts at commercial aviation.Select Books, Cape Town Early landing grounds in the Cape In the early days of aviation, all that was required for take off and landing was a level piece of land relatively free of obstructions. Where a flight commenced and ended depended on the weather, the reason for the flight, the mechanical state of the aircraft and even the whim of the pilot. Navigation was done by following a road or railway line and referring to prominent landmarks such as Table Mountain. There were no laws prohibiting low flying or landing within city limits. Places in the vicinity of Cape Town known to be used as airfields included Kenilworth race course, Green Point Common and Green Point cycle track, Sea Point, Robben Island, Maitland Common, Rosebank Showgrounds and Mr Young's farm near Wynberg as well as local beaches. It would be several years before the commercial prospects of aviation would be grasped and an aviation infrastructure put in place. World War II September 1939 saw the formation of 15 Squadron SAAF at Germiston with three former SAA Junkers Ju 86 airliners used for maritime patrols. After moving to Wingfield the squadron was absorbed as A Flight of 32 Squadron SAAF.The South African Air Force A Fleet Air Arm Hellcat F.I 804 Naval Air Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm reformed in September 1944 at Wingfield aerodrome 24 Hellcat IIs and in January 1945, they embarked on to provide cover during the landings on Ramree Island, and subsequently missions over Sumatra and Malaya. In 1939, Alex Henshaw, Chief Test Pilot for Britain's Spitfire fighter planes, flying a modified Percival Mew Gull registration number G-AEXF, set a number of records for solo flights between Gravesend, Kent (now RAF Gravesend) and Wingfield and back, which still stands today nearly seventy years later.African Pilot The present The SA Navy is to relocate its sprawling technical training school, SAS Wingfield, along with some depots from a run-down World War II-era site near Goodwood to a purpose built new facility at Simon‚Äôs Town.defenceWeb The move ‚Äì for which the Navy has already received an initial R40 million ‚Äì follows a comprehensive multiyear investigation into the rationalisation of the Navy‚Äôs training institutions. The SAS Wingfield Naval Unit continues to exercise its right to the Freedom of Goodwood annually \\"to enter and march in the town with colours flying, drums beating and bayonets fixed\\".Cape Gateway Municipal Aerodrome Cape Town International Airport is now the primary airport serving the city of Cape Town, and is the second busiest airport in South Africa and third busiest in Africa. The airport was opened in 1954 to replace Cape Town's previous airport at Wingfield. Goodwood Correctional Centre On 17 October 1997 one of the most modern prisons in South Africa, the Goodwood Correctional Centre, with a capacity of 1692 beds was officially opened. It was built on Wingfield land to the north of the N1 highway. It is aligned to the concept of rehabilitation.Parliamentary Media Briefing Acacia Park In 1947 a township called Sassar was erected on a portion of Wingfield Aerodrome for the accommodation of officials of the South African Railways and Harbours. From 1948 it also provided accommodation for civil servants and members of Parliament who annually migrate to Cape Town for the parliamentary session. On 1 December 1959, after a competition for a new name, the name was changed to Acacia Park on account of the many Port Jackson willow trees growing there. A primary school was built and provision made for sport and other recreational facilities. At that stage children in the primary school were taught in accordance with the Transvaal syllabus and under the control of the Transvaal Education Department. Acacia Park is currently one of three Parliamentary villages in Cape Town.
