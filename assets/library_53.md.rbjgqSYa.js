Four extant works are commonly attributed to him, as well as a possible fifth which some scholars include in compilations with much reservation. His mythography was greatly admired and highly influential throughout much of the medieval period, but it is viewed with little favour today. Life Very little is known about the life of Fulgentius other than the few references he makes to himself in his own works. His style of Latin, his knowledge of Greek, and his view on classical authors and cults suggests that he was probably educated in North Africa.Whitbread, p. 3 Other references to African culture in his work support placing him in this region before the Muslim invasions of the 7th century. Moreover, his apparent knowledge of the Libyco-Berber language and script indicates that he was probably an ethnic African: he refers to the language in his On the Ages of the World and of Man as being part of his 'own' heritage.Vandals, Romans and Berbers p. 104 Traditionally, Fulgentius is thought to have had a professional career as a grammaticus or rhetor (teacher of rhetoric).Whitbread, p. 6 However, this belief is based on small incidental clues Fulgentius leaves behind in work and has been contested by some scholars.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 211 It remains possible that he was an amateur writer: in his prologue to Book 1 of the Mythologies, Fulgentius mentions a wife, though it is unclear whether this is a genuine autobiographical detail or part of his fictional persona in the story.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 212 =Identity with Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe= There is a continuing debate as to whether or not Fabius Planciades Fulgentius, and a contemporary, Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe (a Christian bishop) were the same person. The identification of the two Fulgentii was first made by medieval scholars and scribes as far back as the Carolingian period.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 185 There is some overlap in the influences of the two authors (as could be expected from writers working in the same time period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern.Whitbread, p. 4 Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer's work, even when a discussion of such things would seem to fit his discussion.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 214 From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer's unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated in the work of the bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 221 It has been suggested that Fabius Fulgentius, who is traditionally thought to have been writing in the late 5th and early 6th centuries may have borrowed a line from Corippus's Iohannis in his Mythologies, which indicates that he was writing after 550.Hays, Vandal Renaissance, p. 102 This discovery has called into serious doubt the possibility of identifying the bishop and the mythographer, as Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe is known to have died in 533. While the identification debate has not yet been settled, the case to identify the two authors appears to rest on weak evidence. Most of the evidence is based on linguistic comparisons as well as biographical details of marginal relevance.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 210 Although the tradition of conflating the two writers is an old one, it most likely originated as a result of Carolingian scribal error.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 186 Writings The four extant works attributed to Fulgentius include (listed in what is believed to be chronological order): #Mythologiae (Mythologies) #Expositio continentiae Virgilianae secundum philosophos moralis (The Exposition of the Content of Virgil According to Moral Philosophy) #Expositio sermonum antiquorum (The Explanation of Obsolete Words) #De aetatibus mundi et hominis (On the Ages of the World and of Man) A fifth work, which in the past has been attributed to Fulgentius is the Super Thebaiden (On the Thebaid). The manuscript ascribes the work to \\"S. Fulgencius Episcopus\\", whom Rudolf Helm (the first modern publisher of Fulgentius' work) considered to be the mythographer. This work was not included in the Carolingian manuscripts (possibly because it did not exist at this time), but was included in Helm's 1897 edition of the works of Fulgentius with strong reservations.Whitbread, p. 235 While there is no consensus on the authenticity of the treatise, there is strong evidence to support the fact that the work was written in the twelfth century by a writer imitating the allegorical style of Fulgentius. This is not to say that the work was a forgery, but more likely that it was mistakenly attributed to Fulgentius as a result of scribal error.Hays, Pseudo-Fulgentian, p. 218 In addition to these, Fulgentius mentions other works that have not survived to the present. In the first prologue to the Mythologies he mentions earlier satirical poems, and in the Content of Virgil he makes reference to his work on physiology.Whitbread, p. 5 =Mythologies= Generally known as his chief work, the Mythologies (Latin: Mitologiarum libri III) is a series of legends told in three books. Each book is introduced by its own prologue. There are a total of fifty chapters: each chapter explains a classical myth and interprets that myth using allegory. These interpretations include etymologies of the names of certain characters, as well as conclusions as to the purpose of the story in terms of morality. In the prologue, Fulgentius claims that his purpose was to strip the classic Greek myths of all their fictitious and meaningless details in order to reveal the obscure truths they contain. He also suggests a Christian motive,Whitbread, p. 16 though it would be inaccurate to define the Mythologies or any of Fulgentius' allegorical works as 'Christian allegories'.Hays, Vandal Renaissance, p. 129 Hays argues the traditional description of Fulgentius' work as 'Christian allegories' is quite inaccurate. The morals Fulgentius extracted from the classical myths were fairly generic, and would have been acceptable to any audience. Fulgentius's etymologies (while typical of his age) have been recently criticized as being extravagant, arbitrary, and often incorrect.Whitbread, p.23 While few have had anything positive to say about such etymological methods within the last two hundred years, the tradition dates back to the work of Plato and was common practice for such philosophic traditions as the Stoics and Neoplatonists. His use of such arbitrary etymologies to substantiate his allegorical claims is typical of his relentless tendency to stretch interpretations and search for truths that are not readily evident.Whitbread, p. 18, 23 Several manuscripts of the Mythologies are addressed to an unidentified Catus, Presbyter of Carthage.Whitbread, p. 106 =The Exposition of the Content of Virgil According to Moral Philosophy= In this exposition (original title: Expositio Virgilianae continentiae secundum philosophos moralis), Virgil and the Muses are summoned to explain the truth of his Aeneid. This text is similar to Fulgentius's interpretations of classical myths in the Mythologies . The shade of Virgil assumes a sage-like status, and he addresses the author in a pretentious and condescending way, often calling him a \\"homunculus\\", or 'boy'.Whitbread, p. 107 While Fulgentius claims to explain the Aeneid as an allegory for the full range of human life, the work seems to end rather abruptly, and the telling only goes as far as manhood. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that any part of the original text was lost. His hurried finish was probably caused by a loss of interest in its completion. By the time of the Content of Virgil's writing, the tradition of allegorizing Virgil was not new. Aelius Donatus had already completed an allegorical exposition of passages of the Aeneid which closely resembles Fulgentius's ideas, indicating that they were probably not unique to Fulgentius.Gardner, Beowulf, p. 228 Furthermore, Fulgentius appears to have taken the idea of Virgil as a sage from the earlier writer Macrobius.Whitbread, p. 110 However, it seems Fulgentius was original in his attempt to systematically interpret the entire Aeneid. He also seems to be the first to attempt to explain the text in a way at least partly acceptable to Christian readers. =The Explanation of Obsolete Words= This text (original title: Expositio sermonum antiquorum), addressed to a person named Calcidium in some manuscripts, is an explanation of 62 antique Latin words that may be found in Roman literature. In his Prologue to the work, Fulgentius states that he compiled the list of words in order to fulfill the commissions assigned by his master (who remains unidentified). His stated aim is to make clear the meaning of these words, not to revive them. However, beginning in the Carolingian period, writers did in fact make use of these rarities, using this text as their source.Whitbread, p. 157 With nearly every explanation, Fulgentius provides the reader with a small quotation as an example of the word's practical use, often citing the work it was taken from. However, many of these quotes are likely to be faked. Some works may be entirely made-up, while others have been liberally edited by Fulgentius. As was common with writers of this period, Fulgentius does not cite his immediate sources, perhaps in an attempt to obscure the fact that he had access to very few to draw from. The entire work was probably an attempt to improve his reputation as a scholar in hopes the reader would not take a critical look into his methods.Whitbread, p. 158 =On the Ages of the World and of Man= This compendium of biblical and classical history (original title: De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII) is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular letter of the alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making it very difficult for the reader to understand his meaning.Whitbread, p. 179 Just as in the Content of Virgil, Fulgentius claims the work was completed as a result of the request of his unnamed patron. The increasingly rapid rate of historical retelling that occurs near the end of the work raises the question of whether the work was completed. Some manuscripts include in their prologues an introduction of the text as running 'from a to z', and others end book fourteen with the statement, \\"Here begins the fifteenth book, lacking P\\".Whitbread, p. 181 However, book thirteen includes a line about ending the series with a history of the Roman emperors. It is possible that the last books have been lost over time, though it is also likely that Fulgentius simply lost interest in the work and gave it a hurried anticlimactic finish, as he did with other works such as the Content of Virgil.Whitbread, p. 182 Throughout his retelling of history, Fulgentius adds moral interpretations of events. He goes to great lengths to justify God's ways, and, consistent with his past works, stretches allegories to fit his ethical interpretations.Whitbread, p. 184 Unlike Fulgentius' other works, Ages of the World did not seem to attract much attention or admiration in the medieval period, probably due to its confusing literary techniques and style.Whitbread, p. 180 There has been some doubt as to whether or not this work was actually that of Fabius Fulgentius, though similarities in language and writing style convincingly demonstrate the attribution of this work to the same author as the first three.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 183 Among the arguments for a different author is an argument in favor of attributing this work to the bishop Fulgentius. This theory is based on the fact that the manuscripts of the Ages of the World attribute the work to \\"Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius\\" (Claudius and Gordianus both being names known to belong to members of the bishop's immediate family). However, the inclusion of these names in manuscripts was most likely the mistake of some eight or ninth century scribe who assumed 'Fulgentius' to be the well- known theologian. It is also possible that Fabius Fulgentius had multiple names (very popular for aristocrats of the time) which included Claudius and Gordianus.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 182 Historiographical contribution Fulgentius's work demonstrates a clear continuation of the antique Roman compendium tradition. This concise encyclopaedic style of compiling information was common for Roman writers like Cato the Elder and Cicero.Whitbread, p. 21 His work is also consistent with the Stoic and Neoplatonic traditions which interpreted myth as a representation of deeper spiritual processes. His allegorical approach to mythography may have originated in the no-longer-extant Virgil commentary of Aelius Donatus, and it was certainly evident in the later moralising Virgil commentaries of Servius. Fulgentius's treatment of Virgil as a sage seems to have been borrowed from the encyclopaedic work of Macrobius, the first to elevate the Roman poet to such an authoritative status. However, Fulgentius's tendency to strip classical myth of all its manifest detail and replace it with ethical interpretations appears to have more in common with the late 5th-century writer Martianus Capella. Capella's work brought the theme of life as a spiritual journey to the forefront of Classical literature, a trend which Fulgentius seemed to carry a step further.Wetherbee, p. 103-106 The Tradition of invoking the aid of questionable etymologies in order to support mythological allegories dates back to Plato, and carried on through Aristotle, the Stoics, and into the Middle Ages. Though Fulgentius was later criticized for such methods, they were not uncommon for writers of the time period (including Martianus Capella).Whitbread, p. 23 Fulgentius's summaries of classical myths have traditionally been compared to his predecessor, Hyginus the mythographer, of the 2nd century AD. While both deal with many of the same legends, and some commonalities between their summaries suggests a common source, their work differs greatly in purpose and interest. Hyginus appears to have been dedicated to producing a comprehensive reference book for the myths, while Fulgentius was more concerned with allegorically dissecting the material, something Hyginus rarely attempts.Whitbread, p. 22 =Influence on later mythography= Fulgentius's work is said to mark the transition from late-antique to Medieval literary study.Wetherbee, p. 107 After a period of decreased interest in the literature, the practice of mythography was picked up again in what is thought to be the 7th century by the so-called Vatican Mythographers. All three writers borrow Fulgentius's methods in order to search the classical myths for obscured meaning.Whitbread, p. 24 However, it was during the Carolingian period, from the 8th through to the 10th centuries, that Fulgentius's work reached the height of its popularity. He came to be admired as one of the founding fathers of mythographic writing, and he was praised for uniting classical pagan literature and Christian teachings.Whitbread, p. 25 This admiration led to the emergence of Fulgentian scholarship. The practice of differentiating between the author's intention and the deeper meaning of a piece of literature‚Äîcarried to the extreme by Fulgentius‚Äîprovided the framework for the commentaries of this period. The Mythologies in particular proved to be an essential storehouse of resources for the Medieval commentators who carried on his tradition of discussing classical poetry in moral terms. Further, his exotic language and use of rare words seemed to influence the writing style of a number of poets throughout the Middle Ages. Fulgentius's manuscripts date as far back as the early 8th century. As a testament to his popularity, a copy of the Mythologies may have been available in England as early as the 9th century. Fulgentius remained a standard part of collections of antique mythology up until the 19th century, when his work began to come under popular criticism as being absurd and factually unreliable.Whitbread, p. 30 It has been suggested that Fulgentius' work, which is thought to have been commonly known throughout most of the Middle Ages, may have been a source for the structure of the famous 7th- or 8th-century epic Beowulf.Gardner, Beowulf, p. 229 Criticism While Fulgentius's works remained popular during and well after the Carolingian period, his factual inaccuracies and questionable interpretations came under harsh criticism in the 19th century. His work has been overwhelmingly dismissed as trivial and misleading ever since.Whitbread, p.30 Historically, Fulgentius's work has been criticized as being bombastic and foolish.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 210, Hays, Varia Fulgentia, p. 135 His Latin prose is obscure and often corrupt, making it difficult to decipher his meaning.Hays, Varia Fulgentiana, p. 127 He is known for unnecessarily long and wordy prose and highly obscure allusions.Whitbread, p. 15 Fulgentius is also known to make significant mistakes in his retelling of history, like his conflation of Augustus with Julius Caesar in On the Ages of the World and of Man.Hays, Date and Identity, p. 220 In addition, many of his facts, as well as his etymologies, are suspected of being based on second-hand sources or completely fabricated.

A WUA usually elects leaders, handles disputes internally, collects fees, and implements maintenance. In most areas, WUA membership depends on one‚Äôs relationship to a water source (such as groundwater or a canal). Local Water User's Boards are widely used to manage irrigation in Peru, and are increasingly used to manage irrigation in the Dominican Republic, although with mixed results. Characteristics of enduring, Self-governing WUAs Political scientist Elinor Ostrom has identified seven important characteristics of organizations which manage common resources well: *Clearly defined boundaries. The membership of the institution must be well defined. It must be clear who has legitimate access to the resource, who is under the authority of the association, and who the ‚Äúothers‚Äù are that must be prevented from access. Additionally, the boundaries of the resource must be defined. In the case of WUAs, the membership would likely be all landowners that receive water from a main canal and the resource would be the flows. This is known as a hydrologic organizing structure. However, some groups choose to organize in ways more familiar to their culture. There are cases of organization by village or kinship which also have had success. *Appropriation, rule, and local conditions congruence. It is necessary for the resource appropriations and rules to be adapted to a local area. Ostrom stresses that it is not specific rules which are necessary for strong institutions but rather rules to which the members agree. Rules made by locals will inevitably make sense with local conditions. *Collective-choice. It is necessary that all members have the opportunity to play a role in changing the rules. All those directly affected (i.e. irrigators) should be able to voice their opinions and vote. While officials are elected to execute duties, the real authority rests with the general assembly of water users. *Monitoring. In order for all users to make a credible commitment to one another and fully cooperate, they must know their fellow users are not stealing. Monitoring may take the form of water guards or more sophisticated gages. *Graduated sanctions. Penalties for those breaking the rules of the organization must be imposed by the members (or an elected board). The penalties should be commensurate with the infraction and could even lead to expulsion from the WUA. Such severe penalties deter users from attempting to steal. *Conflict-resolution mechanisms. One of the beauties of WUAs is the ability to handle disputes on the local level. This avoids the tortuous legal processes in the judicial system and adds to the accountability among the group. The members are apt to make equitable decisions for disputes knowing they may be in a similar situation in the future. *Minimal recognition of right to organize. Members must have the ability to organize without being challenged by external government authorities. In other words, they must be given true authority over their resource and the members in it. WUA are fundamentally a participatory, bottom-up concept. Though they have existed for centuries, they have received particular attention in recent decades as a development tool. WUAs have been organized in developing countries as diverse and distant as Thailand, Brazil, Turkey, Somalia, and Nepal among others.

It holds services at The Star Performing Arts Centre. It is a non-denominational Christian church, and a member of the National Council of Churches of Singapore. It is not affiliated to any church overseas. The senior pastor of the church is Joseph Prince. History Building in Singapore The church was founded by a small group including Joseph Prince, Henry Yeo, David Yeow and Jack Ho in 1983. It was later officially registered with the Registrar of Societies in October 1984. It began its Sunday service with an average attendance of 25 people. Gradually, it grew to about 150 members in 1990 when Prince was appointed as the senior pastor of the church. During the period between 1984 and 1999, the church used different worship venues such as a hall within the premises of the Young Women's Christian Association of Singapore and the ballrooms in local hotels to accommodate its growing congregation. In 1999, the church moved to the Rock Auditorium in Suntec City Mall. On 23 December 2012, its services were shifted to The Star PAC. Outreach The church is involved in outreach work and missions throughout the Asian region, and sends its pastors, leaders and volunteers to several Asian countries annually. Ten per cent of the church's annual budget which was about US$4 million (as of Year 2007) was set aside for missionary work. Currently, the church is still committed to helping missionaries. In addition, the church also makes donations to local charities annually. Specifically, the church has given SGD581,500 to community groups and charities during the period between April 2007 and March 2008. Archived from & Worship venue The church moved to a new 5,000 (5,142) seat theatre, now its main worship venue, at The Star PAC in Buona Vista on 23 December 2012. Officially opened on 1 November 2012, The Star PAC spans levels 3 to 11, known as the civic and cultural zone, of the building called The Star. It is owned and managed by Rock Productions, the business arm of the church. The Star PAC comprises a 5,000-seat theatre, a multi-purpose hall, an outdoor amphitheatre, special function rooms and other facilities. The church rents The Star PAC for Sunday services. The levels from Basement 4 to Level 2 of The Star, known as the retail and entertainment zone (including the car park lots), is called The Star Vista, and is owned by the church. The Star, comprising The Star Vista and The Star PAC, was envisioned as a \\"futuristic complex with restaurants, shops and a 5,000-seat theatre\\", and costs an estimated SGD1 billion.

Rights to the show are owned by Dillstar Productions of Rancho Cucamonga, California and is leased by Beverly Stickney, (president). The shows have been in Anaheim, California, San Diego, California, Palm Springs, California, Chicago, Illinois, Hartford, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts. The show was written by the husband-and-wife team of Paul and Darlyne Franklin. Audience members are active participants in the wedding nuptials and subsequent reception, which take place in a restaurant in Boston's North End owned by the bride's cousin and the play's master of ceremonies, Carmine Cannoli. The wedding, performed by \\"St. Anthony's\\" parish priest Pastor Fazool, brings together the families of two young lovers, Joseph Anthony Gnocchi and Maria Angelina Cavatelli. The cast of characters are all, in fact, named after Italian dishes. Chaos ensues during the ceremony with the unexpected arrival of Joey's provocatively dressed ex-girlfriend, Viola Vermicelli. Viola, it seems, is still in love with Joey. Despite Joey's roving eye, he's very much in love with Maria and loudly protests Viola's arrival. After the couple is joined, the cast leaves the room and are reintroduced one at a time by Carmine. A toast is raised by Joey's scatterbrained best man, Rocco Ravioli. During the toast, dinner is being served to the guests. Upon its completion, the cast moves about the tables, chatting and flirting with the guests. After dinner, the party itself commences with traditional Italian- American flourishes such as a sing-along and a tarantella. The traditional bouquet and garter tosses place the guests who catch them in a rather bizarre and extremely funny onstage situation in which the male guest is asked to remove the garter from the leg of the female guest using only his teeth. The arrival of Maria's Mafioso godfather Don Ziti (often played by a selected good-sport audience member) also means the arrival of a large sum of money for the new couple. The \\"money\\" is handed over to Joey's cousin, bridesmaid Louisa Ravioli, for safekeeping. The money later turns up missing and a male guest is \\"accused\\" of stealing it.

Its distinctive feature is that middle-ranking figures rendered military, political, legal, or domestic service in return for money, office, or influence. As a result, the gentry began to think of themselves as the men of their lord rather than of the king. Individually, they are known as retainers, and collectively as the \\"affinity\\" of the lord, among other terms.  History and historiography  The historian Charles Plummer coined the term \\"bastard feudalism\\" in 1885. Plummer blamed bastard feudalism for the disorder and instability of the Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century. However, \\"bastard feudalism\\" as a concept is primarily associated with Plummer's contemporary William Stubbs (1825‚Äì1901). According to Stubbs, a shift in English history took place under Edward I (reigned 1272‚Äì1307) when the feudal levy was replaced with royal payment in return for military service by the great magnates who willingly served the king. Thus, instead of vassals rendering military service when required by the lord, they paid a portion of their income into the lord's treasury. In turn the lord would supplement the owed military service with hired retainers, a sort of private army in full-time service to the lord. In the 1940s K. B. McFarlane presented a strong challenge to the ideas of Stubbs. McFarlane stripped the term \\"bastard feudalism\\" of any negative connotation. To him, bastard feudalism centred not on the financial aspect (the sums involved were mostly negligible) but on the concept of service in exchange for good favour. In a society governed on a personal basis, service to a lord was the best way to obtain favour in the form of offices, grants, etc. Lords would retain administrators and lawyers, as well as recruiting local gentry into their affinities. By offering money instead of land, lords could afford to retain more followers. In return for becoming retainers, the gentry would expect to rely on their lord's influence in local and national politics. This practice was known as \\"maintenance\\". The retainer might wear his lord's livery badge or the grander form, a livery collar, which could be very useful in a courtroom. Under a weak king, such as Henry VI (reigned 1422‚Äì1461 and 1470‚Äì1471), the rivalries of magnates might spill over from the courtroom to armed confrontations, thereby perverting justice. Because they were rarely kept under arms for long periods, noble retinues were not private armies. Lacking standing armies, kings relied on noble retinues for the military forces they required to conduct wars or to crush internal rebellions. Under an inadequate king like Henry VI, ambitious or disaffected magnates such as Richard Duke of York (1411‚Äì1460) or Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (1428‚Äì1471) could use their network of servants and retainers to defy or even control the crown. Groups of gentry, already coming to blows over local issues, inevitably attached themselves to different patrons. Their private feuds continued under their leaders' banners and transferred to the battlefields of the Wars of the Roses. Although Edward IV (reigned 1461‚Äì1483) attempted to limit \\"retaining\\", he generally did not succeed. However, Henry VII (reigned 1485‚Äì1509) managed to largely overcome bastard feudalism by imposing financial sanctions on unruly nobles. Furthermore, Henry passed a statute in 1504 that only allowed the King to have retainers ‚Äì nobles had to apply and pay for a licence. Overall, bastard feudalism had vanished by the early seventeenth century.

The Mavericks were founded in 1989 in Miami, Florida. Between 1991 and 2003, the band recorded six studio albums, in addition to charting 14 singles on the Billboard country charts. Their highest-peaking American single was 1996's \\"All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down\\", a collaboration with accordionist Flaco Jim√©nez. They are best known in the UK for their 1998 single \\"Dance the Night Away\\", which spent 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 4. In 1996, The Mavericks won a Grammy Award for the song \\"Here Comes the Rain\\". The band split up in 2000, reuniting in 2003‚Äì2004 before splitting up again. During the period 2001‚Äì2011, lead singer Raul Malo released six solo albums. Bass player Robert Reynolds and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden co-founded the 'supergroup' SWAG, along with Ken Coomer of Wilco, Tom Petersson of Cheap Trick, and Doug Powell. In 2012, the band announced plans for several reunion festival dates. Shortly after, they were offered a record deal by Big Machine Records. Their reunion album In Time, was released in February 2013. Since then, the group has recorded and toured regularly. Career The Mavericks began their career within the punk and alternative music scene in Miami, Florida, frequently playing on the same bill as emerging acts including Marilyn Manson. The band initially consisted of singer Raul Malo, guitarist Ben Peeler, bassist Robert Reynolds; and drummer Paul Deakin. This line-up issued an independent self-titled LP before Peeler was replaced by David Lee Holt. In 1991, the band was signed by MCA Nashville, and their first major label release, From Hell to Paradise, debuted in 1992. Holt subsequently left the band, and The Mavericks recorded their follow-up What a Crying Shame as a trio, augmented by session musicians. Nick Kane (lead guitar) appears as the group's fourth member on the album cover, and is credited as a full member of the band in the liner notes, but joined The Mavericks after the album was recorded and does not play on this record. What a Crying Shame produced four top 40 country hits: the title track, \\"O What a Thrill\\", \\"There Goes My Heart\\" and \\"I Should Have Been True\\". A fifth single, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"All That Heaven Will Allow\\", was a minor hit. in February 1994, piano player Jerry Dale McFadden joined the band as an auxiliary player and \\"fifth Maverick\\", though he was not at this point an official full member. He would contribute to all live shows and studio recordings from this point forward, beginning with 1995's Music for All Occasions. This album included the single \\"Here Comes the Rain\\", which won the band a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal the following year. Its follow-up was \\"All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down\\", their highest country chart peak at number 13. During 1996 and 1997, the band embarked on the \\"Tour for All Occasions\\" and released a live album, It's Now! It's Live!. Their 1998 album Trampoline produced a number 4 UK hit in \\"Dance the Night Away\\" ‚Äì remaining on the UK charts for over ten weeks and becoming one of the most recognizable songs for the Mavericks in the UK. \\"I've Got This Feeling\\" and \\"Someone Should Tell Her\\" also made the UK charts. However, the album was not anywhere near as successful in the US, charting much lower than previous Mavericks album releases and failing to spin off any top 40 country singles. In 1999, the band issued a \\"best-of\\" album featuring three new tracks, called Super Colossal Smash Hits of the 90s: The Best of The Mavericks. The album was quickly reissued the following year with two additional new tracks. However, the release did not spin off any top 40 hit singles in either the US or the UK, and the band found itself in a financially precarious situation. In February 2000 the band suspended payments to all their salaried employees, and in May they fired guitarist Nick Kane. Malo embarked on a solo career at this time, and the group effectively dissolved for the next few years. In 2003, the Mavericks were revived, with Eddie Perez added to the line-up in Kane's place. The band recorded a new album The Mavericks, but split up again shortly after the 2004 tour ended. =Reunion= In October 2011, The Mavericks announced plans to reunite for a tour in 2012. In February 2012, the group signed with Valory Music Co., an imprint of Big Machine Records. They released a digital extended play titled Suited Up and Ready, and charted in early 2012 with \\"Born to Be Blue\\". The full-length album, In Time, was released on Valory Records on 26 February 2013. Founding member Robert Reynolds was dismissed from the band in October 2014 after it was revealed that he had developed an addiction to opiates and was soliciting money from fans (under false pretences) to support his addiction, leaving Malo and Deakin as the two remaining original members. This revelation was not made public until December. Reynolds has not been replaced by a permanent band member. As Reynolds' addiction affected his playing, both before Reynolds's firing and after, session players played bass on Mavericks recordings and at live shows (where in recent years Reynolds played a \\"barely audible\\" acoustic guitar that was deliberately buried in the sound mix). In his absence, Ed Friedland is the band's touring bassist. The Mavericks released a new album, Mono, on 17 February 2015. In June 2016 they parted ways with Valory. The group released their ninth studio album Brand New Day on 31 March 2017. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Mavericks among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. On November 1, 2019, to mark their 30th anniversary, they released an album, Play the Hits, of song covers as a tribute to artists who have inspired them. On August 21, 2020, the band released En Espa√±ol, the band's first album entirely in the Spanish language.https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904366868/the-mavericks-are-back-this- time-en-espanol Members Current members * Raul Malo ‚Äì vocals, guitars (1989‚Äì2004, 2012‚Äìpresent) * Paul Deakin ‚Äì drums (1989‚Äì2004, 2012‚Äìpresent) * Jerry Dale McFadden ‚Äì keyboards, vocals (touring 1994‚Äì2004; 2012‚Äìpresent) * Eddie Perez ‚Äì guitars (2003-2004, 2012‚Äìpresent) Past members * Robert Reynolds ‚Äì bass guitar (1989‚Äì2004, 2012‚Äì2014) * Ben Peeler ‚Äì guitars (1989‚Äì1991) * David Lee Holt ‚Äì guitars (1991‚Äì1993) * Nick Kane ‚Äì guitars (1993‚Äì2000) =Timeline= ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:60 top:10 right:100 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1989 till:12/31/2017 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:bass value:blue legend:Bass_guitar id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Lines value:black legend:Albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1989 BarData = bar:RM text:\\"Raul Malo\\" bar:BP text:\\"Ben Peeler\\" bar:DH text:\\"David Lee Holt\\" bar:NK text:\\"Nick Kane\\" bar:EP text:\\"Eddie Perez\\" bar:RR text:\\"Robert Reynolds\\" bar:PD text:\\"Paul Deakin\\" bar:JM text:\\"Jerry Dale McFadden\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:RM from:01/01/1989 till:03/01/2000 color:guitar width:2.5 bar:RM from:01/01/1989 till:03/01/2000 color:vocals bar:RM from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:guitar width:2.5 bar:RM from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:vocals bar:RM from:01/01/2012 till:end color:guitar width:2.5 bar:RM from:01/01/2012 till:end color:vocals bar:PD from:01/01/1989 till:03/01/2000 color:drums bar:PD from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:drums bar:PD from:01/01/2012 till:end color:drums bar:RR from:01/01/1989 till:03/01/2000 color:bass bar:RR from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:bass bar:RR from:01/01/2012 till:10/01/2014 color:bass bar:BP from:01/01/1989 till:10/01/1991 color:guitar bar:DH from:10/01/1991 till:05/12/1992 color:guitar bar:NK from:02/01/1994 till:02/01/2000 color:guitar bar:EP from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:guitar bar:EP from:01/01/2012 till:end color:guitar bar:JM from:02/01/1994 till:03/01/2000 color:keys bar:JM from:02/01/1994 till:03/01/2000 color:vocals width:2.5 bar:JM from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:keys bar:JM from:06/01/2003 till:12/01/2004 color:vocals width:2.5 bar:JM from:01/01/2012 till:end color:keys bar:JM from:01/01/2012 till:end color:vocals width:2.5 LineData = at:10/01/1991 color:black layer:back at:05/12/1992 color:black layer:back at:02/01/1994 color:black layer:back at:09/26/1995 color:black layer:back at:03/10/1998 color:black layer:back at:09/23/2003 color:black layer:back at:02/26/2013 color:black layer:back at:02/17/2015 color:black layer:back Awards = Academy of Country Music Awards = 1994 * Top New Vocal Group * Top Vocal Group 1995 * Top Vocal Group =Country Music Association Awards= 1995 * Vocal Group of the Year 1996 * Vocal Group of the Year =Grammy Awards= 1995 * Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal by =Americana Music Association Honors & Awards= 2015 *Best Duo or Group of the Year Discography Official videography Officially released films featuring the Mavericks are listed with their original release dates. *2014 The Mavericks: In Time Live (DVD ‚Äì Valory Music Co.) *2004 The Mavericks: Live in Austin Texas, directed by Michael Drumm (DVD ‚Äì Sanctuary Records Group) *2004 The Best of the Mavericks: The DVD Collection (DVD ‚Äì MCA Nashville) *1999 The Mavericks LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL SEPT 1998 (DVD ‚Äì Cherry Red Films) References Other sources Hingston, Michael (2005). \\"The Mavericks\\" in the liner notes for The Mavericks Collection.

McKinnell, Jr. (born February 23, 1943) is an American business executive, who served as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Pfizer Inc. from 2001 to 2006/2007. He is also a director of Moody's. Career He was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He originally worked towards a degree in chemistry but later changed his declared degree to business. He earned his bachelor's degree for business from the University of British Columbia in 1965. Later, he earned his master's and doctorate in business administration (finance subfield) from Stanford Business School. His first job offer was for Pfizer, but he instead chose to work at American Standard for three years (1969‚Äì1971). He later joined Pfizer in early 1971. Over the course of the next 32 years, McKinnell climbed his way up several positions. He was named CEO as of January 2001 and named chairman in April 2001. In 2003 he won the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship. McKinnell was known as an aggressive and hard line advocate of trade sanctions against developing countries in disputes over patents and other intellectual property rights on medicines. In 2006, several Stanford alums asked that McKinnell be removed from an advisory board at the Stanford Business School, due to the aggressive use of litigation against the head of the Philippines regulatory agency. Following falling share prices, McKinnell resigned the CEO position on July 28, 2006, amid dissatisfaction from the board of directors and declining investor confidence and was replaced by Jeff Kindler on that day. He was scheduled to remain as chairman until February 2007. Pfizer was relatively conservative with regard to mega-mergers through stock-for-stock transactions through most of its history until McKinnell took the helm in 2001. Pfizer's per share price (adjusted for splits) went from about $50 to $30 from 1999 to 2006 during McKinnell's tenure. With roughly 7 billion shares outstanding, this reflects a loss in value of 140 billion dollars under McKinnell's leadership pursuing a strategy of growth via stock for stock acquisition. It could be argued that some of the decline in Pfizer's market value during this time could be attributed to the overall decline in blue chip stocks from 1999 to 2001. However, many industry analysts criticized McKinnell for diluting shareholder value with these expensive stock-for-stock acquisitions that obviously paid a premium for the underlying value of the acquired company. Furthermore, internal contributions to the pipeline did not replace declining value nor did these M&A; activities. However, McKinnell received record compensation which he staunchly defended against critics. According to documents Pfizer filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, McKinnell received a base salary in 2005 of $2,270,500, and a bonus of $3,700,000. He also received $145,814 in other compensation (primarily tax payments made by Pfizer on behalf of employees), and nearly $5.5 million in long-term incentive payouts. The value of his retirement package and deferred compensation will exceed $275,000,000. McKinnell has, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission, donated mainly to Republican Party candidates. He has donated to George W. Bush, John Thune, Chuck Grassley, and others.

It is a Charismatic church that practices speaking in tongues. The word \\"Baptist\\" in the name is from the church's historic Baptist position. Following the pattern in G12 churches, FCBC is led by Khong and his wife, who together head 12 Teams consisting of 12 couples. Deputy Senior Pastor Daniel Khong has taken over his father as Senior Pastor this year, he has officially taken the position at the G12 Asia Conference 2019. From then, Pastors Lawrence Khong and Nina Khong are the Apostolic Overseers and assist Pastor Daniel.  Ministries  FCBC conducts multiple services at three locations: Touch Centre in Marine Parade, Gateway Theatre (formerly TOUCH Community Theatre) in Bukit Merah currently for its Chinese services and Nicoll meeting rooms 1‚Äì3 in Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre under a lease agreement. FCBC has a community arm, TOUCH Community Services (TCS). TCS serves the local community in Singapore in a variety of ways, including providing various services and help to troubled youth, children, senior citizens, the visually challenged, mentally challenged, physically disabled, family services and in character development. TCS also has an international arm, TOUCH International (TI), that provides aid and relief to disaster spots and areas that need help around the world. TI also supports long-term involvement in global communities and is deeply involved in the rebuilding process in the tsunami stricken areas and others. TCS is a non-profit, non-religious community organisation, which has served over 100,000 individuals since its establishment. In 2007, TCS won the Outstanding non-profit Organisation Award. FCBC also has a media branch known as Gateway Entertainment that produces various movies and stage productions which teach moral values and Christianity. Its pioneering magic & theatre show, The Magic of Love (MOL), toured the United States. As of 2007, over 208,000 people worldwide had watched the show.

There are over 150 churches in this movement united in prayer for Singapore. Other major churches involved include Victory Family Centre and Covenant Evangelical Free Church. Unfair dismissal case In August 2013, FCBC was fined by the Ministry of Manpower and made to compensate a former staff whose employment was terminated 7 months into her pregnancy, depriving her of wages and maternity benefits. The married woman had been dismissed after she was discovered to be pregnant with the child of another former male staff. Employment Act in Singapore protects an expectant mother from the fourth month of pregnancy and requires employers to pay maternity benefits if she is dismissed without sufficient cause during this period. Reverend Khong disagreed with the ministry's judgement, but the ministry said that \\"employment legislation has to be kept secular because of Singapore's multi-cultural and multi-religious society.\\" In October 2013, the church announced plans to file papers requesting a judicial review of the original judgement, believing the ministry had acted unconstitutionally in the way it interfered in the church's affairs.

He served in several high-ranking positions in the South African administration of South West Africa, was the chairman of the 1975‚Äì1977 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference, and co-founded the Republican Party (RP) of Namibia as well as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), now known as the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM). At Namibian independence, Mudge was a member of the Constituent Assembly and 1st National Assembly until he retired in 1993. Mudge was the founder of Namibia's Afrikaans daily Die Republikein and its publisher Namibia Media Holdings. He served on the board of directors until 2008. Early life and education Dirk Mudge, a White Namibian of Afrikaner descent with mixed Dutch and German roots, was born on the farm Rusthof near Otjiwarongo. He was a farmer by profession.\\"The Struggle for Namibia\\" in Time magazine, 24 April 1978 In 1947, he graduated from Stellenbosch University with a Bachelor of Commerce, whereupon he worked as an accountant in Windhoek. Between 1952 and 1960, he farmed with cattle. Political career =Until the 1975‚Äì77 Turnhalle conference= In 1955, Mudge became a member of the pro-apartheid National Party (NP), which governed South Africa between 1948 and 1994. He was elected to the whites-only Legislative Assembly in 1961 to represent Otjiwarongo. In 1965, Mudge became a member of the Executive Committee for South West Africa and thus a high- ranking administrator of the territory, holding this position until 1977.Namibia 1990: An Africa Institute Country Survey, Gerhard Max Erich Leistner, Pieter Esterhuysen, Africa Institute of South Africa, Africa Institute of South Africa, 1991, page 230 When AH du Plessis, the leader of the South West African branch of the National Party, was appointed Minister in 1969, Mudge acted in his position as leader of the NP. At that time he began to disagree with NP's views on the future of South West Africa. He forged a friendship with Herero Chief Clemens Kapuuo, discussed plans for a self- governed South West Africa with then-Prime Minister of South Africa John Vorster, and became one of the driving forces behind the 1975‚Äì77 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference. The Turnhalle Conference was an attempt to win over a broad spectrum of the indigenous population by means of small reforms and compromises, and thus make them cease their support for the armed resistance waged by SWAPO at that time. Its aim was also to cement the separation of the South West African ethnicities by making the future state of Namibia, a constitution of which was drafted at the Turnhalle conference, a confederation of bantustans. Mudge served as chairman. As a result of the conference, many of the participating delegates agreed to aggregate their small, ethnically defined parties into one bigger body that was able to form a counterbalance to SWAPO. Mudge founded the Republican Party (RP) shortly before the Turnhalle proceedings finished. The RP joined when on 5 November 1977 the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) was founded with Clemens Kapuuo as first president and Dirk Mudge as chairman. At that time Mudge founded Die Republikein, until today the only Afrikaans daily, as a mouthpiece of the RP. He also established Democratic Media Holdings (today Namibia Media Holdings), the publishing agency of the newspaper. =In interim governments of South West Africa= The subsequent 1978 South West African legislative election was won by the DTA by a landslide, which claimed 41 of the 50 seats. Although these elections were the first multi-racial elections in the territory of South West Africa there were allegations of widespread intimidation, not least by the presence of South African troops in the north of the territory. The United Nations Security Council declared these elections \\"null and void\\". On 1 July 1980 Mudge became the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the resulting government. The Council resigned in 1983, and the administration of South West Africa was executed by the South African occupiers again.Unhappy Holiday in Time Magazine, 31 January 1983 In September 1983 the Multi-Party Conference (MPC) was established which consisted of 19 \\"internal\\" (that is, South West African) parties. After considering his options, Mudge agreed to become the DTA representative on this conference, although he had hoped for a different outcome of its proceedings: > As in the past, they [proposers of the MPC] did not have any problems in > convincing members of the DTA and other parties to participate, seeing that > there would be financial benefits involved. I found myself standing alone in > the DTA and, much against my will, I agreed to participate ‚Äì provided that > the MPC confine itself to a discussion on constitutional proposals, and that > an interim government would not be considered. I should have known better. > It did not take long before the possibility of another interim government > was raised and strongly supported by virtually every member of the MPC. The MPC suggested in its April 1985 Bill of Fundamental Rights and Objectives the establishment of a Transitional Government of National Unity (TNGU). South Africa followed this suggestion three months later, setting up a forced coalition government under the leadership of the DTA (22 seats) but including five smaller parties of eight seats each. The TNGU was chaired by its ministers on a round-robin basis, changing every three months. Mudge as Minister of Finance took the rotating chairmanship in 1986 and in 1988.List of TGNU leaders worldstatesmen.org However, as president of the largest party in the TNGU, Mudge was the de facto leader of the government, and within the DTA, Mudge's Republican Party was seen as the driving force.Biography: Herman Animba Toivo ja Toivo about.com, last accessed 29 October 2014 =After Namibian independence= In November 1989, Dirk Mudge founded the Democratic Media Trust of Namibia, an agency funding newsprinting in Namibia with the mission to \\"promote a free and independent media in Namibia\\". For the establishment of this trust, money was used that was originally meant to fight SWAPO in the 1989 independence elections. The trust owned Democratic Media Holdings which in turn owned John Meinert Printing, Namibia's biggest newspaper printing works. By 2007 the trust had sold its remaining stakes in the printing industry and became a charity dedicated to education and development. Mudge was chairman of the Board of Directors of the trust until 2008. Mudge gained a seat on a DTA ticket in the 1989 election to the Constituent Assembly of Namibia\\"Namibia Rebel Group Wins Vote, But It Falls Short of Full Control\\", in The New York Times, 15 November 1989 which became independent Namibia's first National Assembly. He retired in 1993. Legacy The effect of Mudge's political involvement on the progress of Namibia's independence is controversial. While on the one side he had been lauded for bringing about a multi-party political system and multi-ethnic elections, others see him as having delayed independence of the territory, prolonged the suffering of the indigenous population, and entrenched racial segregation. On 9 December 2016, 69 years after graduating with a bachelor's degree, Mudge was awarded a PhD honoris causa by his alma mater Stellenbosch University. The motivation read: > ‚ÄúWith exceptional visionary, strategic and transformational leadership, he > not only served as ‚Äúpeace broker‚Äù, leading his traditional support base onto > a new path, but also played a significant role in facilitating > reconciliation between white and black in Namibia. In many respects, he > helped break through the post-World War II impasse on the status and > position of this former mandated territory of South Africa.‚Äù Retirement Dirk Mudge retired from politics in April 1993 and returned to his farm Ovikere near Kalkfeld in Namibia's Otjozondjupa Region. He was married to Stienie Jacobs (she died in 2017). Together, they had five children, sixteen grandchildren and twenty-three great grandchildren. Mudge was the father of fellow politician Henk Mudge who succeeded him as leader of the Republican Party. In May 2015, at the age of 86, Mudge published his autobiography. The book was originally written in Afrikaans and titled \\"Dirk Mudge: Enduit vir ‚Äôn onafhanklike Namibi√´\\". The book was then translated to English and released in May 2016 with the title \\"All the way to an independent Namibia\\". In the preface of the English version, Piet Croucamp writes: > ‚ÄúMudge‚Äôs memoir does not relive the past in times of modernity. The reader > becomes displaced ‚Äí in a way ‚Äí to a familiar but awkward if not painful > past.

Usually the flowers are large and the fruit edible. The name comes from the Ancient Greek ·ºêœá·øñŒΩŒøœÇ (echinos), meaning \\"hedgehog\\", and the Latin cereus meaning \\"candle\\". They are sometimes known as hedgehog cacti, a term also used for the Pediocactus and Echinopsis. Description Echinocereus spp. are bushy and globular with tight spines, which are often colorful and decorative. The flowers last slightly longer than those of other cacti. Cultivation Echinocereus spp. are easier to cultivate than many other cacti. They need light soil, a sunny exposure, and a fresh and dry winter to flower. They grow better in soil slightly richer than other cacti. In the wild, several of the species are cold hardy, tolerating temperatures as low as -23¬∞C, but only in dry conditions.

However, Muhammad was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of the country and with autonomous subnational entities in the north. Early life Muhammad was born in 1939, in Jowhar, an agricultural town in the southern Middle Shabelle region of Somalia (then a colony of Italy known as Italian Somaliland). His family hails from the Abgaal Hawiye clan. Career =United Somali Congress= Muhammad began his career in business, working as an independent Mogadishu-based entrepreneur and first entered politics in 1968, competing for a parliamentary seat in Mogadishu. Whitaker's Almanack World Heads of State, 1998, Stationary Office: Roger East, page 222 After fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Siad Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the abortive 1978 coup d'√©tat.ARR: Arab report and record, (Economic Features, ltd.: 1978), p.602. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed.New People Media Centre, New people, Issues 94‚Äì105, (New People Media Centre: Comboni Missionaries, 2005). However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.Nina J. Fitzgerald, Somalia: issues, history, and bibliography, (Nova Publishers: 2002), p.25. By the late 1980s, Barre's regime had grown considerably unpopular. The authorities became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army (SNA). Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress (USC) commanders Ali Mahdi Muhammad and General Mohamed Farah Aidid, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.Library Information and Research Service, The Middle East: Abstracts and index, Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327. =President of Somalia= In 1991, a multi-phased international conference on Somalia was held in neighbouring Djibouti. Aidid boycotted the first meeting in protest. Due to the legitimacy conferred on Muhammad by the Djibouti conference, he was subsequently recognized by the international community as the new President of Somalia. Djibouti, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Italy were among the countries that officially extended recognition to Muhammad's administration. However, he was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of the country and with autonomous subnational entities in the north. The competition for influence and resources between Muhammad and Aidid continued on through the 1992‚Äì95 UN missions to Somalia (UNOSOM I, UNOSOM II, and UNITAF), until Aidid's eventual death in 1996. In 2000, Muhammad participated in another conference in Djibouti, where he lost a re-election bid to Barre's former Interior Minister Abdiqasim Salad Hassan. Muhammad gave a concession speech, indicating that he respected the outcome of the election and would support and work with the new President-elect.

Biography  Initially a labor organizer, he went on to serve in the Communist Party of China political and military leadership during the civil war between the Nationalists (Guomindang or Kuomintang) and the Communists. He held high office during the CCP's Jiangxi Soviet period (1931‚Äì1934). In October 1934, at the beginning of the Long March, Xiang stayed behind to fight a rearguard action that would allow the marchers to get out of the ring of surrounding Nationalist forces. The marchers, with Mao Zedong as their leader, went on to Yan'an, while Xiang remained in the Jiangxi region, coordinating guerrilla operations to harass Nationalist forces. When the Japanese invaded in July 1937, a united front (the Second United Front) was declared between Nationalists and Communists, and Xiang's guerrillas became the nucleus of a legitimate fighting force: the New Fourth Army. This army operated behind Japanese lines, and was subject to orders coming from both the Communist leadership in Yan'an, and the Nationalist leadership, which had moved inland from Nanjing to Chongqing. Contradictory orders from these groups led to confusion, and eventually the New Fourth Army Incident, in which Xiang was killed in an assault on the army by the Nationalist forces. He was killed by a member of his own staff, Liu Houzong for the gold resources of the New Fourth Army. Xiang had carried the gold on his own person in the aftermath of the incident. After Liu killed Xiang and two other officers, he absconded with the gold and surrendered to the Nationalists, who promptly accepted the gold and jailed him. He was later freed, but his fate beyond 1949 is unknown. The incident was a result of either mistrust or disobedience, or both, between the two parties that would lead to the resumption of full-scale civil war once the Japanese began a full retreat out of China's interior in the summer of 1945, prior to their surrender later that year. Some historians have argued that Xiang was the victim of the indecision of Mao Zedong. Mao's supporters argued that Xiang's misunderstanding of the potential threats posed by the Nationalists, along with his own ambitions, led to his demise. (See Gregor Benton's \\"Mountain Fires\\" and \\"New Fourth Army\\" for thorough accounts of all this. Halliday and Chang's new biography of Mao, \\"Mao: The Unknown Story,\\" contains a very different account of the New Fourth Army Incident in which they suggest Mao engineered the massacre in order to eliminate Xiang, whom he perceived as a rival. This is an unlikely argument, extending Benton's argument that Mao's negligence was partially to blame for the massacre, though the authors do not cite significant sources beyond Benton's to defend their contribution.)

Range roads (Rge. Rd.) are perpendicular to township roads (Twp. Rd.) which run east‚Äìwest along the township grid lines.  Western Canada  In western Canada (especially rural areas in most counties and municipal districts in Alberta), a range road (abbreviated \\"RGE. RD.\\") is a road running on a north-south parallel to a range line (a line denoting the east and west boundaries of a x legal township in the Dominion Land Survey and Alberta Township land surveying systems).  Alberta  Range roads are commonly numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west from the east range line of a given township. The range roads form the east and west boundaries (known as Section Lines) of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of Range line 12, Range Road 6-0 is on Range line 6). In many counties, the dash between the range line number and the section line number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called \\"Range Road one-fifty-one\\"). Where a township road offset from a section line, it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first section line west of Range line 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel). Range roads are perpendicular to township roads (abbreviated TWP. RD.). In the Municipal District of Foothills No. 31, the range and township road naming system has been replaced with a more conventional \\"street/avenue\\" numbering scheme. Range roads are streets numbered west and east of the Fifth Meridian (Meridian Street) in increments of 16 streets to the mile. Township Roads are avenues numbered on a similar grid to the city of Calgary (the boundary lies between 190th and 220th Avenue) and extends out to 722nd Avenue. This system causes confusion at the southern boundary of the City of Calgary as streets in Calgary are numbered east and west of Centre Street, which is some distance west of the Fifth Meridian. Therefore, street numbers change as one crosses Calgary's southern boundary.  Saskatchewan  In Saskatchewan there are both township and range roads. The numbers of the range roads help to establish the location of the roads as they exist with relation to the legal land description survey system. Range roads travel in a north and south direction between the meridians parallel to the latitudinal lines. Range roads indicate firstly the meridian number. In Saskatchewan roads near the Manitoba border would begin with 1 as they would be west of the prime or first meridian, then the range numbers would be west of the second and finally west of the 3rd meridian. There are no roads in Saskatchewan west of the fourth meridian as the fourth meridian line defines the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. The next two digits would be the range number which increments from east to west from a meridian line. The last range number shows how many miles within the range the road is located starting at the easternmost edge of the range and traveling west. As they mark a definite location such as a longitudes and latitudes, the naming convention is the same across Saskatchewan. Township and Range roads can be either gravel, highway, or municipal paved road. The Dominion Land Survey system designated a township road allowance every two miles apart south to north, and allowed for a range road allowance every mile apart east to west. Due to the curvature of the Earth, some townships adjacent to major Meridian lines (e.g. the Fifth Meridian - 114¬∞W) are truncated. There are more townships between meridian lines along the 49th Parallel (the boundary between Canada and the United States of America) than there are along the 60th Parallel (the boundary between Canada's southern provinces and northern territories).

It is also called \\"espinela\\" after its founder, Vicente Espinel (1550‚Äì1624), a Spanish writer and musician of the Siglo de Oro. The d√©cima deals with a wide range of subject matter, including themes that are philosophical, religious, lyrical, and political. Humorous d√©cimas typically would satirize an individual's weakness or foolish act. A decimero would frequently challenge the target of the satire or his/her defender to respond in kind with a d√©cima, thereby setting up a song duel that tested the originality and wit of contending composers.Chicano Popular Culture, Que Hable el Pueblo, written by Charles M. Tatum. Latin America and Spain The decima in all Latin America and in Spain is a style of poetry that is octosyllabic and has 10 lines to the stanza. The rhyming scheme is ABBAACCDDC. It is spoken, sung and written throughout Latin America with variations in different countries. It is often improvised. Each country has its own melody and tone (\\"tonada\\") and a different instrument, but the style and structure is exactly the same. A person who writes or improvises d√©cima is known as a decimista or decimero. The term \\"octosyllabic\\" may be misleading to English speakers; the Spanish term refers to a line whose final accented syllable is its seventh. An octosyllabic line may therefore have only seven syllables or, less commonly, nine. Poetry \\"Juyzio hallado y trobado\\" \\"La vida es sue√±o\\" Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca wrote in d√©cimas some stanzas of Life is a Dream. Nicomedes Santa Cruz made poems about Peruvian life and culture in d√©cimas. Songs Many songs are in the form of d√©cima. For example, Violeta Parra's Volver a los Diecisiete and 21 son los Dolores. Folk singing manifestation A payada is a sung duel of improvised d√©cimas. Ecuador The Ecuadorian d√©cima is an oral poetic form that exists among the black population of the Esmeraldas Province. A d√©cima consists Lof 44 lines, each of which generally has eight syllables. A d√©cima consists of one stanza of four lines, and four more stanzas of ten Olines each. Each of the four lines of the first stanza is repeated later in the poem. Sometimes when these lines are repeated, they are Vslightly altered. Patterns of rhyme and meter are not governed by any particular rules.Rahier, Jean Muteba. \\"Creolization and African Diaspora Cultures: The Case of the Afro-Esmeraldian Decimas\\". In The Ecuador Reader (Carlos de la Torre & Steve Striffler, eds.), pp. 226-236. Duke University Press (2008). . During declamation, there is a pause between stanzas, as well as a pause between the fourth and fifth lines of each ten- line stanza. PThis is reflected in the structure of the poems as well: a transcription of a d√©cima will invariably have a period or a semicolon at the Eend of the fourth line. Some older decimeros add an additional pause between the eighth and ninth line of each ten-line stanza. The structure of the d√©cima suggests that it is derived from the Spanish glosa, which also employs eight- syllable lines and a break between the fourth and fifth lines of a ten-line Istanza. D√©cimas are generally anonymous. Though many decimeros claim to have composed the d√©cimas they recite, this is rarely the case. One scholar of d√©cimas said he met only one decimero who actually composed his own d√©cimas, and that decimeros living in different areas often claimed to have composed the same poems.

Family Boso was the son of Bivin of Gorze, Count of Lotharingia, by Richildis of Arles, the daughter of Boso the Elder by his wife Engeltrude. His maternal aunt Teutberga was the wife of Lothair II, King of Lotharingia. Boso was also the nephew of the Boso, Count of Valois, for whom he was named, and of Hucbert, lay abbot of St. Maurice's Abbey, to which Boso succeeded in 869. He would later marry Ermengard of Italy, the daughter of Louis II of Italy and granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I, whom he married at age 35. Service of Charles the Bald In 870, Charles the Bald, King of West Francia, married Boso's sister Richilde. This marriage paved the way for Boso's career in the service of his royal brother- in-law. In the same year, Boso was appointed Count of Lyon and Vienne, replacing Gerard of Roussillon. In 872, Charles appointed him chamberlain and magister ostiariorum (master of porters) to his heir Louis the Stammerer. Boso likewise received investiture as Count of Bourges. Louis was reigning as a subordinate king of Aquitaine, but because of his youth, it was Boso who looked after the administration of that realm. In the autumn of 875, Boso accompanied Charles on his first Italian campaign and at the diet of Pavia in February 876 he was appointed arch-minister and missus dominicus for Italy and elevated to the rank of duke. He became Governor and Count of Provence in 877. He acted as a viceroy and married Ermengarde of Italy, the only daughter of the Emperor Louis II. Out of favour Boso disapproved of Charles' second Italian campaign in 877 and conspired with other like-minded nobles against his king. After Charles's death in October, these nobles forced Charles's son to confirm their rights and privileges. Boso also formed close relations to the papacy and accompanied Pope John VIII in September 878 to Troyes, where the Pope asked King Louis for his support in Italy. The Pope adopted Boso as his son and probably offered to crown Louis emperor. It is said that he wanted to crown Boso emperor. Independent rule In April 879, Louis the Stammerer died, leaving two adult sons, Louis III of France and Carloman II. Boso joined with other western Frankish nobles and advocated making Louis III of France the sole heir of the western kingdom, but eventually both brothers were elected kings. Boso renounced allegiance to the brothers and in July claimed independence by claiming the title Dei gratia id quod sum: by the Grace of God, that is what I am. He also claimed that his imperial father-in-law had named him as his heir. On 15 October 879, the bishops and nobles of the region around the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne rivers assembled in the Synod of Mantaille. They elected Boso King and successor to Louis the Stammerer, the first non- Carolingian king in Western Europe in more than a century. This event was the first \\"free election\\" among the Franks, without regard to royal descent, inspired by a canonical principle (but not constant practice) of ecclesiastical elections. Boso's realm, usually called the Kingdom of Provence, comprised the ecclesiastical provinces of the archbishops of Arles, Aix, Vienne, Lyon (without Langres), and probably Besan√ßon, and the dioceses of Tarentaise, Uz√®s, and Viviers. After Louis and Carloman divided their father's realm at Amiens in March 880, the two brothers joined to march against Boso. They took M√¢con and the northern parts of Boso's realm. Then uniting their forces with those of Charles the Fat, they unsuccessfully besieged Vienne from August to November. In August 882, Boso was again besieged at Vienne by his brother, Richard, Duke of Burgundy, Count of Autun, who took the city in September. Boso never regained much of his realm and was restricted to the county of Vienne. He died in 887 and was succeeded by his son Louis the Blind. Marriages and issue Depiction of Boso Boso was married twice. The identity of his first wife is not known; his second wife was Ermengard of Italy, only daughter of Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor, whom he wed in March 876. His issue was, in supposed chronological order: * Guilla/Willa (December 873 - before 15 June 929), married firstly Rudolph I of Burgundy, secondly Hugh of Italy; her mother is reported to have been Ermengard, but this seems to be erroneous because she was born before Boso and Ermengarde's wedding * Ermengarde/Ermengard (c. 877 - 12 April 935), married Manasses I the Old, Count of Chalons-sur-Seine (Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne?); her mother is reported to have been Ermengard * Engelberge/Ethelberga, married first Carloman II, secondly William the Pious; her mother is reported to have been Ermengard * Louis the Blind (before 884 - 5 June 928), possibly had a non- marital relationship, next supposedly married Anna/Eudocia Mamikonian (according to a letter that Christian Settipani attributes to Nicholas Mystikos), lastly married Adelaide of Burgundy, who might have been a daughter of his sister Guilla/Willa; his mother is reported to have been Ermengard * Carloman Notes 840s births 887 deaths 9th- century rulers in Europe Frankish warriors Bosonids Kings of Lower Burgundy Rulers of the Carolingian Empire ","title":"Boso of Provence"},{"id":"1852551","text":"Ludvig Gustav Braathen (17 March 1891 ‚Äì 27 December 1976) was a Norwegian entrepreneur that founded the shipping company Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and the airline Braathens SAFE. He was CEO of both companies until his death. Biography Braathen grew up as one of seven siblings in Drammen. He started studying commercial studies as a 15-year-old in Drammen, and later at Treiders Handelsskole in Oslo. In his youth, Braathen wanted to become an entrepreneur, preferably within the lumber industry. He started working for a furniture wood dealer. In 1909, he changed jobs, and started working for ship-owner E. B. Aaby in Str√∏ms√∏. In 1913, he moved to Cardiff in Wales, where he worked for Vivyan Kelly & Company as a head of department. He planned to travel to Argentina and China, each for two years, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 forced Braathen to return home, where he served as a conscript in the Norwegian Royal Guards. After one year, he was hired as an administrator for ship-owner B. A. Sanne in Oslo. When Sanne died in 1922, Braathen was hired as CEO, along with Sanne's son.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 24‚Äì25 In 1926, Braathen started his own shipping company: Braathens Rederi A/S. He invested all his savings, , along with some capital from one of the captains and a broker. Another NOK 25,000 was borrowed. He bought several small ships that were put into service on routes from Europe to China. The first tanker was bought in 1929 and by 1936, the company had ships totalling 56,000 tonnes.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 17 Braathen has stated that the idea of creating an airline occurred to him in 1936, when the ship Brajara had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and at first it was considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown to Japan by KLM. In 1937, Braathen travelled to the United States to study aviation, and he looked both at flying boats and took a Douglas DC-3 operated by Trans World Airlines from Kansas City to San Francisco. In 1938, Braathen sent an application to the Norwegian authorities to receive concession and subsidies to start a route from Oslo to New York City. This was rejected, since the authorities did not feel the time was right to give subsidies for such a route.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 17‚Äì19 On 26 March 1946, Braathens Rederi established an airline called Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport (Braathens SAFE), a subsidiary that bought several Douglas DC-4 aircraft to start charter flights to the Far East and South America. The main intention was to supply his ships with supplies and crews, in addition to providing a service for other shipping companies and travelers. Braathen remained CEO of the company until his death, when the company was taken over by his son Bj√∏rn G. Braathen.

Its color intensity varies with different growing conditions. It was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by the farmer O. Moran from Waiwhero in the Moutere Hills near Motueka, New Zealand. It was then cultivated by the Williams Brothers nursery as a potential export variety. Recent research indicates Braeburn is the offspring of Delicious and Sturmer's Pippin with Lady Hamilton as a sibling. The apple itself is named after Braeburn Orchard near Motueka, where it was first commercially grown. Braeburn apples have a combination of sweet and tart flavor. They are available October through April in the northern hemisphere and are medium to large in size. They are a popular fruit for growers because of their ability to store well when chilled.University of Massachusetts Cold Spring Orchard page Braeburn apples are useful in cooking in that they hold their shape and do not release a great deal of liquid making them ideal for tarts.Gordon Ramsay (2008) Gordon Ramsay's Healthy Appetite, Quadrille Publishing Ltd According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States.  Braeburn browning disorder  Apples can be preserved by short, medium or long-term storage. Braeburn can turn brown inside during commercial long term storage, and it's usually not possible to tell if an apple has the Braeburn browning disorder until a person bites or cuts into it. Apples respond dramatically to both temperature and atmosphere modification. Rapid temperature reduction and the exacting maintenance of low temperature close to the chilling point of the variety can provide good to medium quality product following 3 to 6 months of storage and in some cases longer. However, modern commercial warehouses couple temperature management with controlled atmosphere (CA) for long-term storage of apples. Braeburn can be stored at 0 ¬∞C in the air for 3‚Äì4 months, and in CA for 8‚Äì10 months, with only a slight susceptibility to scalding although it is sensitive to carbon dioxide.USDA ‚Äì Apple white paper The variety has a relatively impermeable skin, which restricts diffusion of gases into and out of the fruit, leading to high internal carbon dioxide concentrations.Goodfruit.com The browning disorder seems worse in overmature fruit, fruit from lightly cropped trees, and large fruit, but it can show up on different trees in different years, and in some regions, but not others. Maintaining the superior qualities of Braeburn while eliminating Braeburn browning disorder led to the development of the Jazz cultivar. Since Braeburn is such a desirable variety, commercial orchards and trees in regions and locations that have proven not susceptible to the browning disorder are being maintained. Since most home orchardists do not attempt very long term storage, they do not encounter the browning disorder.

Role in Barenaked Ladies Stewart met Steven Page, Ed Robertson, and Jim Creeggan at the Waterloo Busker Carnival in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada in the summer of 1990, and soon fulfilled the trio's desire for a real kit drummer. When Andy Creeggan (who played congas) returned from a trip to South America to find Stewart on drums, he felt somewhat displaced. Creeggan eventually switched to playing mostly keyboards. Stewart has been with the band ever since. He also adds numerous percussive and melodic elements, including piano on Born on a Pirate Ship. Stewart utilizes an electronic sampler pad for live performances. During acoustic or smaller shows (or sets within shows), he sometimes plays other percussive elements live, including shakers, bongo drums, and drumming on unusual objects, such as an instrument case. Stewart is the only band member who has not actively written songs for the group's albums nor does he write for a side project. He has received a writing credit on only three songs in the band's catalogue: \\"Grade 9\\" from Gordon, \\"Why Say Anything Nice?\\" from Barenaked Ladies Are Men (co-written with Page and Robertson), and \\"Allergies\\" from Snacktime! (lyrics co-written with Kevin Hearn, music written by all five then-members). Up until the 2009 acrimonious departure of lead singer Steven Page, Stewart had sung lead on only two recorded songs. Stewart sings lead on \\"Allergies\\" and a cover of \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" which was cut from Barenaked for the Holidays. Stewart also sings lead on a version of \\"Feliz Navidad\\" which the band has performed live for holiday shows since 2004. The song has also been played on other occasions with the word \\"navidad\\" replaced by lyrics relevant to the event (such as \\"Feliz Ships and Dip\\", and \\"Feliz Halloween\\", among others). Stewart assumed some of Page's vocal responsibilities for live performances, including \\"Alcohol\\" from Stunt. Stewart also sings the chorus on the song \\"Four Seconds\\" from All in Good Time. Early life Stewart was born in Toronto, but was raised in Newmarket, Ontario. He is the son of Sandra Stewart and stepson of Robert Stewart. Stewart's biological father, Leonard Hawkins, is black, a fact which Stewart learned when he was about 12 years old. His stepfather sang in a Scarborough rock band named \\"The Wizards of Id\\", formed at Woburn Collegiate Institute where both Steven Page and Ed Robertson would later attend. He credits his parents' relative youth (they were only 19 when he was born) with exposing him to interesting music which was frequently played around the house when he was young. He has claimed that his unique eyebrows are the result of his shaving them off when he was eight years old. Stewart is a graduate of Huron Heights Secondary School. He received a Bachelor of Applied Arts degree in Radio and Television Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) in 1989, making him the only member of Barenaked Ladies to have earned a degree. Stewart was a member of The Ambassadors Drum and Bugle Corps, playing bongos and pit percussion from 1979‚Äì1980, and tri-drums from 1980 to 1982. He was the drummer for cowpunk/rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo and later 3 Day Bender in the late 1980s. When he met the Barenaked Ladies, at a buskers' festival, he was drumming for the Would Be Goods, a Guelph acoustic duo featuring stage actor Christine Brubaker, and singer Chris Reynolds. Personal life Stewart's wife, Jill (n√©e Spratt), is a former high school French teacher, and the two were married on September 19, 1998; they have three daughters, Mili, born April 2, 1999, Hazel, born April 16, 2001 and Carmen, born January 28, 2011. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking. He is a huge hockey fan and actively promotes Women's Hockey in Canada, serving on the board of The Ladies First Hockey Foundation and coaching his daughters' teams, one being The George Bell Titans. Stewart also went to high school with former Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph where the two became friends. He also enjoys playing hockey, and is a member of the Jokers Hockey Club in the Canadian Exclaim! Hockey Summit of the Arts. Stewart is also an occasional panelist/contributor on the post-game show for Hockey Night in Canada, and an on-air contributor to the morning show on The Fan 590. He took part in Super Skate, a celebrity hockey game fundraiser at Madison Square Garden for the Christopher Reeve Foundation in 1999, 2001 and 2002. Participants included Denis Leary, Kim Alexis, Rick Moranis, Chris Jericho, Gary Dell'Abate, Chad Smith, Darren Pang and Jason Priestley, among others. Stewart is a member of the Canadian Charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them on campaigns like radio PSAs. Stewart is the first cousin of Kevin Yarde, a former television presenter for The Weather Network and the current Member of Provincial Parliament for Brampton North in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Drum equipment Stewart currently plays Sonor drums and Sabian cymbals. He uses Vic Firth drumsticks (mainly 55A and RUTE606). Previously, He had his own signature sticks made by Regal Tip from 2004‚Äì2015 which he designed with his drum tech, Rob \\"Tiny\\" Menegoni. The sticks were called Ty-phoons (a second, \\"dipped\\" version of which was released in the mid-2000s). He also uses a Roland SPD-S sampling multi-trigger pad and Roland Electronic Drums and pads. Stewart uses Aquarian Drumheads. Prior to his switch to SONOR in early 2015, Tyler played Pearl Drums from mid-2006. Stewart used custom Ayotte drums from at least 1994, and prior to that, Canwood drums.

In the case of temperature dependence, this phenomenon may be called thermo-capillary convection (or B√©nard‚ÄìMarangoni convection). History This phenomenon was first identified in the so-called \\"tears of wine\\" by physicist James Thomson (Lord Kelvin's brother) in 1855. The general effect is named after Italian physicist Carlo Marangoni, who studied it for his doctoral dissertation at the University of Pavia and published his results in 1865. A complete theoretical treatment of the subject was given by J. Willard Gibbs in his work On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances (1875-8).Josiah Willard Gibbs (1878) \\"On the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances. Part II,\\" Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 3 : 343-524. The equation for the energy that's required to create a surface between two phases appears on page 483. Reprinted in: Josiah Willard Gibbs with Henry Andrews Bumstead and Ralph Gibbs van Name, ed.s, The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, ..., vol. 1, (New York, New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1906), page 315. Mechanism Marangoni effect experimental demonstration Tears of wine show clearly in the shadow of this glass of wine with a 13.5% alcohol content Since a liquid with a high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with a low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature). In simple cases, the speed of the flow u \\\\sim \\\\Delta\\\\gamma /\\\\mu, where \\\\Delta\\\\gamma is the difference in surface tension and \\\\mu is the viscosity of the liquid. Water has a high surface tension of around 0.07 N/m, and a viscosity of approximately 10‚àí3 Pa s, at room temperature. So even variations of a few per cent in the surface tension of water can generate Marangoni flows of almost 1 m/s. Thus Marangoni flows are common and easily observed. For the case of a small drop of surfactant dropped onto the surface of water, Roch√© and coworkers performed quantitative experiments and developed a simple model that was in approximate agreement with the experiments. This described the expansion in the radius r of a patch of the surface covered in surfactant, due to an outward Marangoni flow at a speed u. They found that speed of expansion of the surfactant-covered patch of the water surface occurred at speed of approximately u \\\\sim \\\\frac{(\\\\gamma_W-\\\\gamma_S)^{2/3}}{(\\\\mu\\\\rho)^{1/3}r^{1/3}}\\\\sim \\\\frac{10^{-2}}{r^{1/3}} ~~~~r~~\\\\mbox{in m} for \\\\gamma_W the surface tension of water, \\\\gamma_S, the (lower) surface tension of the surfactant-covered water surface, \\\\mu the viscosity of water, and \\\\rho the mass density of water. For (\\\\gamma_W-\\\\gamma_S)\\\\sim 10^{-2} N/m, i.e., of order tens of per cent reduction in surface tension of water, and as for water (\\\\mu\\\\rho)\\\\sim 1 N m‚àí6s3, we obtain the second equality above. This gives speeds that decrease as surfactant-covered region grows, but are of order cms/s to mm/s. The equation is obtained by making a couple of simple approximations, the first is by equating the stress at the surface due to the concentration gradient of surfactant (which drives the Marangoni flow) with the viscous stresses (that oppose flow). The Marangoni stress \\\\sim(\\\\partial\\\\gamma/\\\\partial r), i.e., gradient in the surface tension due gradient in the surfactant concentration (from high in the centre of the expanding patch, to zero far from the patch). The viscous shear stress is simply the viscosity times the gradient in shear velocity \\\\sim \\\\mu (u/l), for l the depth into the water of the flow due to the spreading patch. Roch√© and coworkers assume that the momentum (which is directed radially) diffuses down into the liquid, during spreading, and so when the patch has reached a radius r, l\\\\sim ( u r/u)^{1/2}, for u=\\\\mu/\\\\rho the kinematic viscosity, which is the diffusion constant for momentum in a fluid. Equating the two stresses u^{3/2}\\\\sim \\\\frac{( u r)^{1/2}}{\\\\mu}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\gamma}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) \\\\sim\\\\frac{r^{1/2}}{(\\\\mu\\\\rho)^{1/2}}\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_W-\\\\gamma_s}{r} where we approximated the gradient (\\\\partial\\\\gamma/\\\\partial r)\\\\sim (\\\\gamma_W-\\\\gamma_s)/r. Taking the 2/3 power of both sides gives the expression above. The Marangoni number, a dimensionless value, can be used to characterize the relative effects of surface tension and viscous forces. A very detailed mathematical treatment of this from the point of view of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations and the equations of thermodynamics can be found in the first third of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability originally published in 1961 by Oxford, and republished by Dover in 1981.  Tears of wine  As an example, wine may exhibit a visible effect called \\"tears of wine\\", as shown in the photograph. The effect is a consequence of the fact that alcohol has a lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass due to capillary action. Alcohol evaporates from the film leaving behind liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect, and the liquid drips back down the vessel's walls. This can also be easily demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film. The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell. Significance to transport phenomena Under earth conditions, the effect of gravity causing natural convection in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the Marangoni effect. Many experiments (ESA MASER 1-3) have been conducted under microgravity conditions aboard sounding rockets to observe the Marangoni effect without the influence of gravity. Research on heat pipes performed on the International Space Station revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate at one end and migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid. This is due to the Marangoni effect, together with capillary action. The fluid is drawn to the hot end of the tube by capillary action. But the bulk of the liquid still ends up as a droplet a short distance away from the hottest part of the tube, explained by Marangoni flow. The temperature gradients in axial and radial directions makes the fluid flow away from the hot end and the walls of the tube, towards the center axis. The liquid forms a droplet with a small contact area with the tube walls, a thin film circulating liquid between the cooler droplet and the liquid at the hot end. The effect of the Marangoni effect on heat transfer in the presence of gas bubbles on the heating surface (e.g., in subcooled nucleate boiling) has long been ignored, but it is currently a topic of ongoing research interest because of its potential fundamental importance to the understanding of heat transfer in boiling. Examples and application A familiar example is in soap films: the Marangoni effect stabilizes soap films. Another instance of the Marangoni effect appears in the behavior of convection cells, the so-called B√©nard cells. One important application of the Marangoni effect is the use for drying silicon wafers after a wet processing step during the manufacture of integrated circuits. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an alcohol vapor (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a nozzle over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface. A similar phenomenon has been creatively utilized to self-assemble nanoparticles into ordered arrays and to grow ordered nanotubes. An alcohol containing nanoparticles is spread on the substrate, followed by blowing the substrate with a humid air flow. The alcohol is evaporated under the flow. Simultaneously, water condenses and forms microdroplets on the substrate.

Unlike his two predecessors, he is not called King of Scotland in his death notice, but merely Mormaer. This has led to some speculation that he was never actually the ruler of Moray, but merely a subordinate of Mac Bethad mac Findl√°ich. (Hudson p. 136). In 1020, he participated in the killing of his uncle Findl√°ech. The Annals of Ulster (s.a. 1032) reports that Gille Coemg√°in was burned to death, together with 50 of his men. The perpetrators are not mentioned in any sources. From circumstances, two candidates have been proposed to have led the atrocity: Malcolm II of Scotland or Gille Coemg√°in's cousin Mac Bethad, who then became the only ruler of Moray. Mac Bethad reportedly married Gille Coemg√°in's widow, Gruoch - either as a conquered enemy widow or a widow of an ally and kinsman, depending on who was responsible for the murder. Both scenarios are entirely credible, knowing archaic medieval customs - nothing exculpatory can be concluded from the marriage, whereas the adoption of the stepson may be a weightier indication. Gille Coemg√°in was the father of Lulach, a future King of Scotland, fostered by Mac Bethad, whom he succeeded. In fiction In the animated series Gargoyles, Gille Coemg√°in is referred to as Gillecomgain. As a boy, Gille Coemg√°in surprises Demona prowling around one night in his family's barn, and is promptly slashed in the face by the female gargoyle, creating the generational line of \\"hunters\\" bent on destroying all gargoyles. As an adult, just as in medieval reality, Gille Coemg√°in kills his uncle Findlaech of Moray, here under the orders of Duncan I of Scotland. Duncan rewards Gillecomgain by making him High Steward of Moray and marrying him to Gruoch.

Moakley won the seat from incumbent Louise Day Hicks in a 1972 rematch; the seat had been held two years earlier by the retiring Speaker of the House John William McCormack. Moakley was the last Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Rules before Republicans took control of the chamber in 1995. Early life and education Moakley was born in South Boston, Massachusetts, April 27, 1927, and grew up in the Old Harbor public housing project. Lying about his age, he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II and was involved in the Pacific War from 1943 to 1946. After returning home, Moakley attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida from 1950 to 1951, and he received his LL.B. at Suffolk University Law School in Boston in 1956.  Career  In 1958, he partnered with his Suffolk classmate Daniel W. Healy and together they opened a law practice at 149A Dorchester Street in South Boston. They remained legal partners into the late-1970s. Moakley was a member of the Portuguese American Civic Club located in Taunton, Massachusetts. Moakley served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1953 to 1963 and in the Massachusetts Senate from 1964 to 1970. He was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. After the retirement of longtime Congressman John W. McCormack, Moakley ran for the Democratic nomination in the ninth district but lost to Boston School Committee chair Louise Day Hicks, who gained support based on her opposition to school desegregation. He was a member of the Boston City Council from 1971 to 1973. In 1972, Moakley ran as an independent against Hicks and defeated her by 3,448 votes. The day after he switched his party affiliation to the Democratic Party, Moakley was sworn in to Congress on January 3, 1973. He was reelected 14 times, never facing substantive opposition. He only faced Republican challengers six times; the other times he was either completely unopposed or faced only minor-party opposition. In 2002, he posthumously received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his unrelenting commitment to ending the war in El Salvador and throughout Central America, and for the compassionate care he gave his constituents in Massachusetts for nearly three decades. He was succeeded in office by fellow Democrat Stephen Lynch. =Opposition to the legislative veto= Moakley was prominent in the opposition to the legislative veto, which became an increasingly popular device in the 1970s. He held up in committee a controversial bill proposed by Rep. Elliott Levitas that proposed to institute the legislative veto as a general feature of legislation. His position was vindicated when the Supreme Court held in INS v. Chadha (1983) that the legislative veto violated the bicameralism and presentment clauses of the U.S. Constitution.Barbara Hickson Craig, Chadha: The Story of an Epic Constitutional Struggle (NY:Oxford University Press, 1988) =The Moakley Commission= Moakley led a special panel that investigated the 1989 deaths of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador. The United States ended its military aid to El Salvador in part because of the Moakley Commission's report implicating several high-ranking Salvadoran military officials in the murders. =Later career= Joe Moakley chaired the Committee on Rules from the 101st Congress through 103rd Congress. Moakley managed to have a bridge in Boston named for his wife, Evelyn Moakley, after her death. The Evelyn Moakley Bridge is next to a U.S. Courthouse, which was subsequently named the John Joseph Moakley Federal Courthouse shortly before his death. Joe Moakley Park in South Boston is also named after him. Moakley's efforts led to the acquisition by Bridgewater State College (Bridgewater, MA) of a $10 million grant. The grant allowed the construction of the campus fiber network and a new regional telecommunications facility, which dramatically enhances the teaching capability of the region's educational professionals and promotes the growth of the region's economy. The John Joseph Moakley Center for Technological Applications provides training in the use of technology for students, teachers, and members of the workforce. The three-story building houses a large computer lab, a television studio, an auditorium, and numerous classrooms.  Personal life  In 2001, Moakley announced that he would not be running for re-election for his 16th term in 2002, due to his ongoing battle with myelodysplastic syndrome. Moakley died on May 28, 2001, in Bethesda, Maryland. His body was interred in Blue Hill Cemetery, Braintree, Massachusetts.

Early life and family life The McDonald brothers were born in poverty in Manchester, New Hampshire. They were born to Patrick J. McDonald and Margarete McDonald, a married couple of Irish immigrants who came to the United States as children. Business careers In 1937, the McDonald brothers opened a hot dog stand in Monrovia, California, inspired by a local hot dog stand that seemed to be the only profitable business in town, and which primarily served patrons at a local racetrack. However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended. Maurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street (). The new restaurant proved a success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal. The McDonald brothers decided that the latter were the ideal customer they wanted to attract. After a couple years in business, the brothers began making plans to renovate their business model based on the lessons they had learned. One of these involved finding a more efficient way to service customers than the carhop young women, whom they considered slow, unreliable workers who spent too much time flirting with customers to increase their tips. Another was that hamburgers accounted for a large proportion of total sales. The griddles were much easier to clean than grills and burgers were faster to assemble than sandwiches. In 1948, the brothers fully redesigned and rebuilt their restaurant in San Bernardino to focus on hamburgers, milk shakes, and french fries. While this new \\"McDonald's,\\" situated at the same address, was still premised on most customers arriving by car, its design was unique due to a combination of factors: * Like the brothers' previous food stands, the design deliberately omitted an interior dining area. * There was no waiting staff; orders were taken in person at the front counter, where the food was also delivered. * The brothers designed the kitchen area themselves, integrating their acquired knowledge into an assembly line‚Äìstyle layout that maximized efficiency and output. * The burgers were pre-cooked and kept warm. The new restaurant was a success, and with the goal of making $1 million before they turned 50, the McDonald brothers began franchising their system in 1953, beginning with a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, operated by Neil Fox. At first they only franchised the system, rather than the name of their restaurant. Later, the brothers started franchising the entire concept, with restaurants built to a standard design, created by Fontana, California, architect Stanley Clark Meston, and featuring Richard's suggestion of the paired Golden Arches, which formed an M when viewed from an angle. In 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent.Business Stories of All Time: Ray Kroc; John Wiley & Sons; 1996. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out in 1961. On November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald, the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's, was served the ceremonial 50 billionth McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.\\"La reina de la cocina (r√°pida) cumple 100 a√±os\\".

The basic concept behind a house of mirrors is to be a maze-like puzzle. In addition to the maze, participants are also given mirrors as obstacles, and glass panes to parts of the maze they cannot yet get to. Sometimes the mirrors may be distorted because of different curves, convex, or concave in the glass to give the participants unusual and confusing reflections of themselves, some humorous and others frightening.  References in fiction  = Literary = The first known literary example is in Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera (1911), in which Erik has built one for the Shah of Persia as a trap and later uses a similar trap to protect his lair from his enemies. The concept has also been used in comics. In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman is seen chasing the Joker through an amusement park and into a hall of mirrors. It was used to create suspense as Joker could not clearly decipher what was real and what was just an image. = Film = In Charlie Chaplin's 1928 movie The Circus, Charlie Chaplin is chased into a mirror maze by a thief and the police. Woody Allen's movie Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) directly refers to the mirror scene at the climax of the film The Lady from Shanghai (1948). In John Boorman's 1974 movie Zardoz, character \\"Z\\" (Sean Connery) battles against \\"The Vortex\\" in a mirror maze. One of the most famous ending sequences in film history related to a house of mirrors is in Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee. The finale takes place in a house of mirrors, where Lee learns it is best to smash the glass obstacles to solve his problem and defeat the villain. Francisco Scaramanga's \\"Fun House\\" in the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun has a House of mirrors. The 1984 movie Conan the Destroyer with Arnold Schwarzenegger contains a house of mirrors fight.

In Christian liturgy, \\"the Pax\\" is an abbreviation of the Latin salutations \\"pax vobis\\" (\\"peace to you\\") or \\"pax vobiscum\\" (\\"peace with you\\"), which are used in the Catholic Mass and Lutheran Divine Service. Origins Like the other liturgical salutations, e. g., \\"Dominus vobiscum\\", the Pax is of biblical origin. The Vulgate version of the Gospels contains such forms as \\"veniet pax vestra\\", \\"pax vestra revertetur ad vos\\" (literally, \\"may your peace return to you\\"; figuratively, \\"let your peace rest on you\\" or \\"may you be treated with the peace with which you treat others\\" ()), \\"pax huic domui\\" (\\"peace to this house\\" ()), \\"pax vobis\\" (\\"peace be with you\\" (, , and )). The salutation \\"gratia vobis et pax\\" or \\"gratia misericordia et pax\\" is the opening formula of most of the Epistles of Saint Paul, Saint Peter, and Saint John, and of the Book of Revelation. Liturgical Use Jesus Christ and the Twelve Apostles quoted the formula from the Old Testament,Cf. especially \\"pax vobiscum\\" and \\"pax tecum\\"; and . and they were preserved in the liturgy and Christian epigraphy. Like the \\"Dominus vobiscum\\", they were first used in the liturgy, specifically in the form of \\"pax vobis\\", by the bishop in welcoming the faithful at the beginning of the Mass before the collect or oratio. When the Confiteor, introit, and Gloria in excelsis were later added to the Mass, the \\"pax vobis\\" and \\"Dominus vobiscum\\" were preserved. The form \\"pax vobis\\" was employed by bishops and prelates only at the first collect, while priests used \\"Dominus vobiscum\\". Hence the \\"Dominus vobiscum\\" became the ordinary introduction to all the orations and most of the prayers. Greek Christians have preserved \\"pax omnibus\\" and \\"pax vobiscum\\". There was a certain rivalry between the two formulae \\"pax vobis\\" and \\"Dominus vobiscum\\", and some councils, especially that of Braga in AD 561, ordained that both bishops and priests use the same form of salutation (for the texts, see the bibliography). Besides this episcopal or sacerdotal salutation, \\"pax tecum\\", \\"pax vobis\\", or \\"pax vobiscum\\" are used in the liturgy at the kiss of peace. \\"Te\\" of \\"tecum\\" and \\"vobis\\" are the ablative forms of the second person singular and plural pronouns, respectively; both are translated in English as \\"you\\".Another Latin showdown over 'Pax vobiscum' ‚Äî unless it's 'tecum', Chicago Tribune, 19 November 2014. On such occasions the liturgy contains prayers or collects ad pacem.Cf. Kiss; Cabrol in \\"Dict. d'arch√©ol. et de liturgie\\", s. v. \\"Baiser de Paix\\", where all references are given. In the Ambrosian Liturgy, at the end of the Mass, the congregation is dismissed with \\"ite in pace\\".Cf. \\"Auctarium Solesmense\\", 95. Dom MarteneMartene, III, 171 and 174. gives other instances of the use of \\"pax\\".

It spanned three issues each of Uncanny X-Men #225-227, X-Factor #24-26, and New Mutants #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo. The 1990 computer game X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants was based on this storyline. Promotion Franklin Richards. Art by Jon Bogdanove. Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \\"mutant menace\\" and Senator Robert Kelly's proposed Mutant Registration Act, which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \\"Days of Future Past\\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles cover dated \\"November 1987\\". Asking \\"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government. Plot summary The Fall of the Mutants consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants. =Uncanny X-Men= The X-Men head to Dallas, Texas in search of their missing and de-powered leader Storm, herself seeking the mutant inventor Forge to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter Freedom Force, a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by Mystique, who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant precognitive Destiny then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing ‚Äî in Texas, in the middle of summer ‚Äî and as cavemen, dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city. Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter Neal Conan and cameraman Manoli Wetherell, who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force. Storm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers), The Uncanny X-Men #185‚Äì186 spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools ‚Äî and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg ‚Äî enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas. Time and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the Vietnam War. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naivet√©, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the Adversary, the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in. As Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified Kitty Pryde) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Longshot, Rogue, Dazzler, Psylocke, Havok, and Cyclops' estranged wife Madelyne Pryor) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess Roma, who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the Siege Perilous, telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered. =X-Factor= X-Factor (Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman and Caliban) is transported to the Ship of the villain Apocalypse. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his Four Horsemen. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate Angel, thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor- sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team Power Pack helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the Statue of Liberty. As the team battles the Horsemen, Iceman comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it. =The New Mutants= The New Mutants (Cannonball, Cypher, Magik, Mirage, Sunspot, Warlock, and Wolfsbane) head off to visit their friend Bird-Brain on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as The Right tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to Limbo. They then return home, where Magneto (headmaster of the Xavier School in Professor X's absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death. Disgusted, the team quits Magneto's tutelage, while deciding to stay dedicated to Professor X's dream of peace. Tie-Ins While not officially part of the crossover, a number of other Marvel comic books were billed as \\"Fall of the Mutants\\" Tie- Ins: *Captain America #339 :As a reward for defeating Marvel Girl, Apocalypse teleports his Horseman Famine to the American midwest to destroy its crops and cattle with her life-draining powers. Steve Rogers (who had at the time given up the uniform of Captain America and was simply operating as \\"The Captain\\"), along with allies Nomad, Falcon and D-Man, fight and bring an end to her attack on \\"America's bread basket\\". *Daredevil #248-249 252 :Apocalypse's attack on New York City brings chaos and looting to its streets, with many citizens thinking a nuclear attack has occurred. Daredevil and the Black Widow do their part to restore order. *Power Pack #35 :The children of Power Pack become involved in the chaos of Apocalypse's attack on the city and come into conflict with the Horseman Pestilence. Pestilence dies when part of the Empire State Building falls on her, but not before she infects Katie Power. This sickness spreads to her siblings, but the Pack overcome the affliction by initiating their healing talents together. *Fantastic Four #312 :After the ticker-tape parade honoring X-Factor for saving the city from Apocalypse and his Horsemen, the team help the Fantastic Four defeat Doctor Doom. *Hulk #340 :Wolverine fights the Hulk while the X-Men are flying in their Blackbird to Dallas. The comic does not have the 'Fall of the Mutants Tie-In' logo on the cover despite being advertised as such. Collected editions The storyline has been collected into a trade paperback: *Fall of the Mutants (272 pages, February 2002, ) It has also been collected into an oversized hardcover: *X-Men: Fall of the Mutants (824 pages, May 2011, ) :Collects New Mutants (1983-1991 1st Series) #55-61, Uncanny X-Men #220-227, X-Factor (1986-1998 1st Series) #18-26, Captain America (1968-1996 1st Series) #339, Daredevil (1964-1998 1st Series) #252, Fantastic Four (1961-1996 1st Series) #312, Incredible Hulk (1962-1999 1st series) #336-337 and 340 and Power Pack (1984-1991 1st Series) #35 The oversized hardcover has been split into two trade paperbacks: * X-Men: Fall of the Mutants Vol. 1 (New Mutants #55-61; Uncanny X-Men #220-227; Incredible Hulk #340) * X-Men: Fall of the Mutants Vol. 2 (X-Factor #18-26, Incredible Hulk #336-337, Power Pack #35, Daredevil #252, Captain America #339, Fantastic Four #312) In other media The 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse is based on the storyline as presented in X-Factor, including the creation of Archangel, Apocalypse's introduction and recruitment of other mutants. However, it is Magneto who is the central horseman, with his story-arc mirroring Warren's.http://screenrant.com/x-men-apocalypse-magneto- powers-michael-fassbender/ * The video game: X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants was inspired by this crossover.

The Piano Concerto No. 5 in F major, Op. 103, popularly known as The Egyptian, was Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' last piano concerto. He wrote it in 1896, 20 years after his Fourth Piano Concerto, to play himself at his own Jubilee Concert on May 6 of that year. This concert celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his d√©but at the Salle Pleyel in 1846. This concerto is nicknamed \\"The Egyptian\\" for two reasons. Firstly, Saint-Sa√´ns composed it in the temple town of Luxor while on one of his frequent winter vacations to Egypt, and secondly, the music is among his most exotic, displaying influences from Javanese and Spanish as well as Middle-eastern music. Saint-Sa√´ns said that the piece represented a sea voyage. Saint-Sa√´ns himself was the soloist at the premi√®re, which was a popular and critical success. Structure and overview #Allegro animato #:The Allegro animato alternates several times between two contrasting themes. It begins warmly, introducing a simple subject on the piano, which is imbued at each new variation with increasing energy by a brilliant and technically challenging piano part featuring runs up and down the keyboard. This dissolves into a much slower, more melancholic subject, recalling that of the Andante sostenuto movement of Saint-Sa√´ns' second piano concerto. Like waves, the two lead into one another until finally the second theme gives way to a gentle coda. #Andante #:The Andante, traditionally the slow and expressive movement in concerto form, begins literally with a bang; the timpani punctuate an orchestral chord followed by an intensely rhythmic string part and an ascending and descending exotic run on the piano. This exciting introduction segues into the thematic exposition based on a Nubian love song that Saint- Sa√´ns heard boatmen sing as he sailed on the Nile in a 'dahabiah' boat. Lush and exotic, this is the primary manifestation of the Egyptian sounds of the piece and probably the source of the nickname. Toward the end of the section, the piano and orchestra produce impressionistic sounds representing frogs and the chirping of Nile crickets. #Molto allegro #:The soloist begins the third Molto allegro with low rumbles suggesting the sounds of ships' propellers before exhibiting a vigorous and bustling first theme that rushes all over the piano. The piano continues in its dizzying motion as the woodwinds and strings bring in a driving new melody. The two combine and overlap, creating an active tension that Saint-Sa√´ns uses to great dramatic effect, concluding the movement with a triumphant flourish. He later adapted these themes in 1899 for the Toccata that closes the Opus 111 series of piano √©tudes. Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo piano, piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, tam tam, and strings.

Freeden pilots and crew ; :The main character of the series, and a 15-year-old hot-headed boy who is skilled at Mobile Suit operation and espionage. He was originally hired to rescue Tiffa Adill from the Vulture ship Freeden but upon realising his employer only wanted to exploit her later becomes part of its crew. Though considered an Old Type, he is later revealed as a piloting genius by Jamil, as he quickly masters new Gundam upgrades. For much of the series, he nurses a fairly obvious crush on Tiffa but does not act, fearing that the Tiffa would be unnerved by his advances, since she was denied most of her childhood. His love for her is what drives him to pilot the GX-9900 Gundam X, the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider, and later the GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. At the end of the series, he and Tiffa go off together when the crew of the Freeden disband. ; :A mysterious Newtype girl who demonstrates clairvoyance throughout the series. She is \\"rescued\\" by Garrod from the Freeden but later joins the crew together with Garrod. She is very quiet and shy due to the horrible things she has seen, and is a frequent target for kidnapping due to her abilities. Thanks to Garrod and the Freeden crew she begins to open up, and eventually falls in love with Garrod. Although she has paranormal abilities, she has never once considered herself a Newtype. In Gundam X, she and Garrod have two character songs each. ; :The captain of the Freeden, a Vulture ship. He was once a Newtype pilot of the old United Nations Earth who piloted a Gundam X in the 7th Space War, and it was also him who fired the fatal shot which changed history. Now he searches the Earth for Newtypes to rescue and protect. It seems that he has had feelings for a fellow Newtype named Lucille Lilliant for many years, and at the end of the series he gets together with his advisor Sala Tyrrell and works as a liaison between the Earth Governments and the Space Colonies. :Jamil Neate and Lancerow Dowell's rivalry mirrors that of the Newtype aces Amuro Ray and Char Aznable. Their final battle in 7th Space War is similar to the final clash of the original Gundam series between the Gundam and the Zeong. However, Gundam X goes to an alternate way at the last, where Lancerow saved Jamil's life and worked as the representative of the SRA in the peace conference after the war. ;Techs Farzenbarg :The Freeden physician, versed in a variety of knowledge, from psychology to 20th-century European poetry. His other interests are equally varied, and include coffee and billiards‚Äîhe is a skilled player, but sometimes sneaks into the rec room for private practice sessions. After the crew parted ways, he continues to practice medicine in field hospitals, skillfully keeping soldiers of both sides from one another's throats. ;Roybea Loy :The pilot of the GT-9600 Gundam Leopard and its upgraded form GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy. At the beginning he was only hired to do one job for the Freeden but later takes a more permanent position as one of her defenders. He's pretty much a ladies man who does, however, care for each lover he has had. On a humorous note, Roybea displays the ability to accurately gauge a woman's clothing sizes just by looking at her. He acquired his Gundam on a bet from a woman he considered his true love. He has a crush on Sala, who firmly rejects his advances. He and Ennil El eventually become a couple and are last seen in Witz's hometown. ;Toniya Malme :She is the bridge operator in charge of communications. In contrast to her crewmate Sala, she is a free-spirited woman who is fashion- conscious and sensitive. She quickly becomes friends with Ennil El at Saint's Island, and although she invites her to join the Freeden, it would take some time for Ennil to join forces. Before the final battle near the lunar base, Witz proposed to her; at the end of the series she accompanies him to his hometown. ;Shingo Mori :The Freeden helmsman, who can also be found working in supply procurement, salvaging, guard duty, and trade negotiations. It is said that he is able to pilot even a spacecraft simply by reading the manual . ;Kid Salsamille :The Freeden chief mechanic, and a (self-styled) technical genius at the age of 12. He strives for high quality and professionalism in his work, and will push himself to work beyond exhaustion. He also has an impulsive side; specifically, he can hardly resist tinkering with Mobile Suits and other large mechs. His grand ideas, however, led to the powerful upgrades for the Freeden Gundam complement. At the series' close, he, along with Shingo, Paula, and his two subordinates Lokoko and Nine open a repair shop and salvage yard called \\"Freeden III\\". ;Witz Sou :The pilot of the GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster and its upgraded form GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst. Like Roybea, he initially had a one-time contract with the Freeden but finally also joins the crew. Later in the series it is revealed that he uses the money gained from his work as a mercenary to support his family. He returns home at the end of the series with his new fianc√©e Toniya, Roybea and Ennil. ;Sala Tyrrell :She is the bridge operator in charge of the sensors and hangar, and second-in-command to Jamil. She has a straightforward, by-the-book attitude that projects a rather stern image, particularly when Tiffa was brought aboard, as Jamil often focused his attention on the girl. She does, however, grow to become fond of Tiffa when she sees her abilities help protect the Freeden from danger. New United Nations Earth ;Shagia Frost :The elder of the twin Frost brothers, working for the New United Nations Earth as a spy. He pilots the NRX-0013 Gundam Virsago and its upgraded form NRX-0013-CB Gundam Virsago Chest Break. He has been under the care of the UNE Newtype Laboratory from his youth, and while he trained with recognized Newtypes, his telepathic ability was not compatible with the Flash System, and so the lab designated him as \\"Category F\\" along with his brother Olba. As a result, he made it his personal mission to eliminate any Newtype candidate that the UNE government ordered him to find, in revenge against the people who would not recognize his power. Cold and ruthless, he is also deeply committed to his cause, and will stop at nothing for its success. He and his brother seemingly perish at end of the series in their final confrontation with Garrod Ran, but are seen briefly at the end; Shagia is seen in a wheelchair. :He appears as the pilot of the Virsago in arcade game Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam. ;Olba Frost :The younger of the twin Frost brothers, also working for the New United Nations Earth. He pilots the NRX-0015 Gundam Ashtaron and its upgraded form NRX-0015-HC Gundam Ashtaron Hermit Crab. Although he tries to assume the same attitude of his brother, he is at times a bloodthirsty Mobile Suit rider, obsessed with his sense of superiority. He only respects his beloved brother Shagia, and will usually obey his orders even if his emotions get the better of him. He and Shagia apparently die after their duel with Garrod, but the last scene shows that they survived, with Shagia in a wheelchair and Olba standing next to him. :Olba makes a brief appearance in arcade game Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam as Ashtaron, featured as Virsago's usable weapon (where Ashtaron holds the Gundam X to let Virsago deliver the finishing blow) and Virsago's Mobile Armor mode(Ashtaron carries Virsago to increase travelling speed and length); through never shown, Olba appears in the game when Virsago is the last unit to be destroyed. :Olba Frost's voice actor stated in an interview that after using \\"Nii-san\\" (Older brother) so many times during the series, he has developed an aversion to the word. ;Fixx Bloodman :The leader of newly-formed New United Nations Earth. Although he says he doesn‚Äôt want to repeat the mistakes of the past he is only interested in war. The Frost brothers work for him but in truth he is manipulated by them. He was killed by Frost Brother's Satellite Cannon in the Final Battle. ;Aimzat Kartral :The UNE Intelligence Minister who is the Frost brothers' superior at the start of the series. He deeply believes that Newtypes are the way to greater power for humanity, and has tried to further this view among his superiors in the UNE Reconstruction Committee. He involves the design of Gundam Double X but the suit was stolen by Garrod (with the help of Jamil, Tiffa and Kattok). He was finally killed by Frost Brothers as they think Aimzat has no more use for them. Space Revolutionary Army ;Lancerow Dowell :An officer and Mobile Suit ace in the SRA during the 7th Space War, he was the arch-rival of Jamil Neate. After meeting Tiffa, he tried, to no avail, to persuade SRA President Zaider Rasso not to use certain superweapons against the resistance group Satyricon. Zaider's stubbornness, along with the death of his friend Nichola Fafas, caused him to question his involvement in the war. In the end he joins up Jamil's Vultures and becomes part of the peace movement to improve relations between Earth and the Colonies. ;Zaider Rasso :The president of the SRA and also the leader of Newtypism, a cult that forwards the view that all space-born people are Newtypes. His target is to conquer Earth and for this he tries to contact D.O.M.E. in the lunar base, because he knows the ultimate secret of Newtypes. He was killed by Frost Brother's Satellite Cannon in the Final Battle. ;Nichola Fafas :A SRA officer who kidnaps Tiffa and brings her to the colonies. He is a friend of Lancerow Dowell and like him he begins to question Zaider‚Äôs motives. Because of this, he is arrested and executed for sedition. Other ;Paula Cis :Paula is a member of the space colony resistance group \\"Satyricon\\", and the pilot of the GS-9900 G-Falcon. She is a loudmouthed, tomboyish orphan, and one of the first children born after the colony drop that ended the 7th Space War. She is the only person her age in Satyricon, and as such, she takes an immediate liking to Garrod when he is brought to the asteroid base. When Garrod accepts the rebels' offer to repair the Double X, she makes him her partner, as the G-Falcon has the ability to dock with most Gundam-type Mobile Suits. At the end of the series, she and the rest of the Freeden engineering crew open up a repair shop. ;Carris Nautilus :An artificial Newtype whose goal is to bring peace to a united world. For this goal he assists Nomoa Long in his attempt to use the mobile armor Patulia. Because he is an artificial Newtype, he regularly suffers from the condition called the \\"Synapse Syndrome\\", where he experiences pain akin to a terrible death. Initially he defeated Garrod with the RMSN-008 Bertigo, severely damaging the Gundam X, but later falling to the upgraded Divider and a recovered Garrod. After the New United Nations Earth is established, he joins an anti-UNE militia in the North American continent, later intercepting a convoy carrying the Freeden Gundams and rescuing the Vulture crew. He later takes part in the final battle and becomes a peace ambassador for his country. ;Ennil El :The daughter of deceased SRA Major General Nada El. She and her father were stranded on Earth at the end of the war and after he died, she developed a hatred of those living on the planet. She became a mercenary and had numerous run-ins with the Freeden crew, at one point assisting in the Patulia project. She develops feelings for Garrod, though he never returns them. After the Patulia is destroyed, she wanders into Saint's Island where she opens a restaurant called \\"Lilac\\" and attracts the eye of Miles Goodman. But she finds that she could not escape her violent past, and ends up leaving after learning her new friend Toniya is a Freeden crew member. Eventually she joins the Freeden, and at the end of the series she travels to Witz's hometown together with Roybea. ;D.O.M.E. :The mysterious entity which exists in the lunar base with the satellite system; his name is an acronym for \\"Depths Of Mind Elevating\\". He is the first Newtype and later reveals the truth about himself and Newtypes to the Freeden crew and the leaders of New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. Although he has been dismantled into a genetic level. \\"He\\" (with the aid of the system in lunar base) can operate everything, including the G-Bit, on his own. :It was initially planned that the D.O.M.E. would be voiced by Toru Furuya (voice actor of Amuro Ray), but Furuya turned down the offer. He would not involve any Gundam-related cast other than Amuro until Mobile Suit Gundam 00, in which he was cast as character Ribbons Almark and the narrator of the series. ;Nomoa Long, AKA Professor Dorat :Mayor of Fort Severn. He was actually a leader of the SRA infiltration plot called \\"Operation Lilac\\", in which a team of Newtypes with RMSN-008 Bertigos and the Mobile Armor Patulia assault major UNE targets on the Earth. The plan had failed however, and with only one Bertigo and the Patulia at his disposal, he spent fifteen years perfecting the artificial Newtype technology in the hope of one day exacting his revenge on the Earth. ;Fong Alternative :Director of the Alternative laboratory, where Tiffa Adill was found by Jamil Neate. He is exploitative, as demonstrated by his attitude toward Tiffa, and by his willingness to dispose of his mercenaries, the Frost brothers, with the SRA Mobile Armor MA-06 Grandine. ;Reich Anto :He is the Alternative laboratory agent who hired Garrod to recover Tiffa from the Freeden. =Vultures= ;Zakot Datnel :The leader of a Vulture group apparently specializing in incendiary weapons. He was, at one point, partners with Ennil El, and was a reckless scavenger, sending his Mobile Suit riders into defunct UNE power plants despite their tendency to explode. ;Gritz Jo : ;Rosa Intenso : ;Rosso Amarant :These three Vulture captains are old friends of Jamil's, and were recruited by him to help rescue Tiffa from the Alternative laboratory after she was recaptured by Olba Frost. =Renegade Mobile Suit riders= ;Krokka :This is the pilot of the Mobile Suit in episode 1 that was thrown to the civilians. His suit was captured by Garrod undamaged, and himself was being thrown into ground, where furious civilian are waiting for him. ;Vedoba Morte :In episode 2, she is the first Mobile Suit rider to discover the GX. Her suit was heavily damaged by the Gundam X in combat, and she was killed by other vultures who was hunting for the Gundam X. =Orcs= ;Doza Baroy :First appearing in episode 16, he is the Orcs' primary producer and distributor of the D-Navi, an underwater navigation system that used the brains of dolphins. He becomes obsessed with capturing the Freeden Gundams after he discovers them rescuing Tiffa during a hunt for dolphins. And his ship was sunk by Gundam Leopard which was modified to use in water. ;Marcus Guy :An Orc submarine captain who was hired by Olba Frost to salvage several G-Bits on the ocean floor in the region called the \\"Sea of Lorelei\\". He and Olba discover Lucille Rilliant encased in the L System, a device that deactivates electrical systems within a large radius by amplifying a Flash System-compatible Newtype's power. But finally he was killed by First brother to avoid information leakage. =Civilians= ;Miles Goodman :He is the son of the Saint's Island Immigration Bureau director and one of the immigration officers. He asked Ennil to marry him, but he would never hear her answer, as New United Nations Earth forces executed him along with all government members.

It uses specially coated recordable CD and DVD media to produce laser-etched labels with text or graphics, as opposed to stick-on labels and printable discs. Although HP is no longer developing the technology, it is still maintained and supported by a number of independent enthusiasts. The LightScribe method uses the laser in a way similar to when plain data are written to the disc; a greyscale image of the label is etched (physically burned) onto the upper side of the disc using a laser. In the beginning, the discs were available only in a sepia color but today are available in many monochromatic colors. The purpose of LightScribe is to allow users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to stick-on labels), using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a compatible disc writer are required. Before or after burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user turns the disc over and inserts it with the label side down. The drive's laser then burns the label side in such a way that an image is produced. (see Thermal printing; LightScribe uses a laser instead of a thermal printing head)  History  LightScribe was conceived by Hewlett-Packard engineer Daryl Anderson, and the coating's chemistry was developed by Dr. Makarand Gore, and brought to market through the joint design efforts of HP's imaging and optical storage divisions in 2004. It was the first direct to disc labeling technology that allowed users to laser etch images to the label side of a disc. DiscT@2 technology had been on the market since 2002, but DiscT@2 allows users to burn only to the unused portion of the data side of the disc. In 2005, LabelFlash became the main competitor for LightScribe. Various brands manufacture the required media. Dual Layer DVD+Rs are currently the highest-capacity disc to support the technology. There has yet to be any development of LightScribe Blu-ray discs. Companies such as HP, Samsung, LaCie and LiteOn have discontinued or are phasing out LightScribe drives with only LG continuing to manufacturing drives; until the manufacturing of LG LightScribe drives was discontinued. , LightScribe.com HP's official LightScribe website has been removed. This has been replaced with the following message: , the website returns a 404 error. , the website redirected to Hewlett-Packard's homepage. , HP Desktop PCs Customer Support still has an article of instructions and FAQ about LightScribe.  Mode of operation  The surface of a LightScribe disc is coated with a reactive dye that changes color when it absorbs 780 nm infrared laser light. The etched label will show no noticeable fading under exposure to indoor lighting for at least two years. Optical media should always be stored in a protective sleeve or case that keeps the data content in the dark and safe from scratches. If stored this way, the label should last the life of the disc in real-world applications. LightScribe labels burn in concentric circles, moving outward from the center of the disc. Images with the largest diameters will take longest to burn. LightScribe is monochromatic, initially a grey etch on a gold-looking surface. From late 2006, LightScribe discs are also available in various surface colors, under the v1.2 specification. The etching is still in shades of grey. It is not possible to replace a LightScribe label with a new design (as in erase the surface of the disc), but it is possible to add more content to a label that has already been burned. The center of every LightScribe disc has a unique code that, together with a sensor in the drive, allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc. This, in combination with the drive hardware, allows it to know the precise position from the center outwards, and the disc can be labeled while spinning at high speed using these references. It also serves a secondary purpose: the same disc can be labeled with the same image multiple times. Each successive labeling will darken the blacks and increase image contrast (see drawbacks). Successive burns are perfectly aligned.  Drawbacks  Special storage precautions are necessary to prevent LightScribe discs from fading. HP's LightScribe website warns users to \\"keep discs away from extreme heat, humidity and direct sunlight\\", \\"store them in a cool, dark place\\", \\"use polypropylene disc sleeves rather than PVC sleeves\\", and also notes that \\"residual chemicals on your fingers could cause discoloration of the label image\\". Such chemicals include common hand lotions and hair care products. Users not observing these precautions have reported LightScribe discs to become visibly faded within two months in the worst case. This drawback makes the technology unsuitable for applications involving continuous handling, and for such popular uses as car music compilation discs, which typically have unavoidable high light and temperature exposure. Since many disc players present internal temperatures significantly higher than room temperature, LightScribe discs should also not be left in disc players for long periods of time. LightScribe discs may form a visible white powder coating. This is due to crystallization of some of the label-side coating. It is not harmful and can easily be removed with a water-dampened cloth. Wiping the disc with a damp cloth does not harm the inscribed label. At this point, LightScribe support has not explained which conditions lead to this reaction, nor the precautions that can be taken to avoid it. Multiple LightScribes of the same image increases contrast, but the image quality decreases with successive burns. Noticeable contrast variations are seen in solid shades.  Other uses  A LightScribe optical drive was used by Maher El-Kady, a graduate of UCLA in 2012 to successfully turn a specially prepared graphite oxide layer coated onto a DVD into graphene. El-Kady and Richard Kaner, his lab professor, used an unmodified LightScribe drive. The disc was prepared by coating the disc with an aqueous solution of graphite oxide and allowing it to dry. Areas of the coating illuminated by the LightScribe laser were turned into graphene. Various shapes can be drawn, which allowed the scientist duo essentially to laser-print an ultracapacitor on graphene using consumer-grade technology.

Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. It is the pigment responsible for a greenish color sometimes seen in bruises.  Metabolism  Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin along with hemosiderin, in which biliverdin normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Biliverdin is seen briefly in some bruises as a green color. In bruises, its breakdown into bilirubin leads to a yellowish color.  Role in disease  Biliverdin has been found in excess in the blood of humans suffering from hepatic diseases. Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of biliverdin or bilirubin (or both) in the circulatory system and tissues. Jaundiced skin and sclera (whites of the eyes) are characteristic of liver failure.  Role in treatment of disease  While typically regarded as a mere waste product of heme breakdown, evidence that suggests that biliverdin ‚Äî and other bile pigments ‚Äî has a physiological role in humans has been mounting. Bile pigments such as biliverdin possess significant anti- mutagenic and antioxidant properties and therefore, may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to be potent scavengers of hydroperoxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants ‚Äî all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin ‚Äî as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments ‚Äî may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.  In non-human animals  Biliverdin is an important pigment component in avian egg shells, especially blue and green shells. Blue egg shells have a significantly higher concentration of biliverdin than brown egg shells. Research has shown that the biliverdin of egg shells is produced from the shell gland, rather than from the breakdown of erythrocytes in the blood stream, although there is no evidence that the sources of the material are neither tetrapyrroles nor free haem from the blood plasma. Along with its presence in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin is present in the blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs. With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green color fades out soon after birth. In the garfish (Belone belone) and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin. Biliverdin is also present in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea. It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or physiological adaptation of any kind. It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, although no statistically significant correlation has been established. The Cambodian frog, Chiromantis samkosensis, also exhibits this characteristic along with turquoise bones.  In fluorescence imaging  Fluorescent proteins visualize the cell cycle progression. IFP2.0-hGem(1/110) fluorescence is shown in green and highlights the S/G2/M phases. smURFP- hCdtI(30/120) fluorescence is shown in red and highlights the G0/G1 phases. In a complex with reengineered bacterial phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging of the first bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging. A new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, Œ±-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5.

His title was Takumi no Kami (). He is known as the person who triggered a series of incidents retold in a story known as Ch≈´shingura (involving the forty-seven r≈çnin), one of the favourite themes of kabuki, j≈çruri, and Japanese books and films. Biography He was born in Edo as the eldest son of Asano Nagatomo. His family was a branch of the Asano clan whose main lineage was in Hiroshima. His grandfather Naganao was appointed to the position of daimy≈ç of Ako with 50 thousand koku. After Naganao died in 1671, Nagatomo succeeded to the position, but died after three years in 1675. Naganori succeeded his father at the age of nine. In 1680, he was appointed to the office of Takumi no Kami, the head of carpentry at the imperial court, but this office was nominal, as were other offices granted to samurai at that time, and only had an honorific meaning. As a daimy≈ç with a small fief, he was appointed several times to temporary minor offices of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1683, he was first appointed one of two officials to host the emissaries from the imperial court to the Shogunate. It was the first time he met Kira Yoshinaka, the highest-ranking k≈çke, the head of ceremonial matters at the Shogunate, who instructed officials in the manner of hosting noble guests from Kyoto. In 1694, he suffered from a serious illness. He had no children, thus no heir at that time. When a daimyo died without a determined heir, his house would be abolished by the shogunate, and his lands confiscated; his retainers became r≈çnin. To prevent this, he adopted his younger brother Asano Nagahiro, titled Daigaku, who was accepted as his heir by the shogunate. In 1701, he was appointed for the second time to the same office. It is said that he was then on bad terms with Kira Yoshinaka, and tension between them increased. Grave of Asano Naganori at Sengaku-ji On the day of his death, he drew his sword and attempted to kill Kira in the Corridor of the Pines at Edo Castle in what is now Tokyo. He was wounded and failed to kill Kira. On the same day, the fifth Tokugawa sh≈çgun Tsunayoshi sentenced him to commit seppuku, which he did after writing his death poem: „ÄåÈ¢®„Åï„Åù„ÅÜËä±„Çà„Çä„ÇÇ / „Å™„ÅäÊàë„ÅØ„Åæ„Åü / Êò•„ÅÆÂêçÊÆã„Çí / „ÅÑ„Åã„Å´„Å®„ÇÑ„Åõ„Çì„Äç \\"kaze sasou hana yori mo / nao ware ha mata / haru no nagori wo / ika ni toyasen.\\" \\"More than the cherry blossoms, Inviting a wind to blow them away, I am wondering what to do, With the remaining springtime.\\" He was buried in the graveyard of Sengaku-ji. His retainers became ronin when the Shogunate confiscated his fief. Under the leadership of ≈åishi Kuranosuke, however, they avenged the death of their lord by killing Kira at his mansion in Edo on December 15, 1702. These former retainers became famous as the forty-seven r≈çnin, and their vendetta ranks as one of the most renowned in Japan. Further reading Nakajima Shizuo ‰∏≠Â≥∂ÈùôÈõÑ (1985).

It is situated between Thompson and Churchill on the Hudson Bay Railway line. Many residents of Gillam are employed by Manitoba Hydro at one of their many facilities or support groups. Hydro has four hydro damsKettle Generating Station, Long Spruce Generating Station, Limestone Generating Station(Largest in MB) and Keeyask (in construction) ‚Äî three HVDC stations Radisson, Henday and Keewatinohk and a few support groups  located within Gillam's boundaries.  History  The large Gillam Local Government District () was established by the Manitoba government in the mid-1960s to facilitate development of hydroelectricity on the lower Nelson River. At , Gillam is considered to be the 9th largest city or town in Canada by area, although the majority of the encompassing area of the District is largely uninhabited and undeveloped, but filled with many lakes, rivers and large forests of pine trees. It is the largest town in Manitoba, and one of four extremely large \\"towns\\" (the other three are Leaf Rapids, Snow Lake, and Lynn Lake) in northern Manitoba that, although technically towns, are mostly rural and are the size of most typical counties in the United States or eastern Canada. Gillam is also the home of Fox Lake Cree Nation, a First Nations Band. A majority of the members of Fox Lake Cree Nation live in the Town of Gillam or on Reserve Land in the nearby community of Bird, which is also located within the Gillam Local Government District. The ghost town of Sundance whose purpose was to facilitate the building of the Limestone Generating Station, is also within the District of Gillam. Once a busy, fully functioning town, it has since been abandoned and torn down after the completion of Limestone (named for the Limestone River that empties into the Nelson just downstream of the dam). = Notable event = In late July and early August 2019, Gillam became an inadvertent subject in worldwide media after a burning Toyota RAV4 was found near Fox Lake Cree Nation. The RCMP confirmed it belonged to Leonard Dyck, a BC man whose body was found near a burning pickup truck south of the Stikine River Bridge in British Columbia. The pickup truck's owners, Bryer Schemegelsky and Kam Mcleod, then just considered missing persons, became suspects in the murder of Dyck and of a tourist couple whose bodies were found near Liard Hot Springs, BC. The RCMP launched a massive manhunt in the surrounding Gillam area, scouring through more than 11,000 square kilometres of dense brush and forest, and conducting searches of more than 500 houses in Gillam and nearby York Landing. After several days of fruitless searching, a breakthrough came through on August 3rd, when a damaged rowboat and several objects belonging to Schmegelsky and Mcleod were found scattered along the banks of the nearby Nelson River. On August 7th, the RCMP confirmed that it had found the bodies of Schemegelsky and Mcleod about 1 kilometre from the rowboat, who died in dense brush of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. They were found approximately 65 kilometres north-east of Gillam.  Geography  Stephens Lake Gillam is located on the southeastern shore of Stephens Lake, a reservoir created by Manitoba Hydro in 1971 by the Kettle Dam on the Nelson River. = Climate = Gillam has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with long and extremely cold winters, briefly interrupted by short and mild summers. Its inland position at 56 degrees latitude causes severe freezes in winter, even though its all-time extreme cold temperatures are less extreme than its normals suggest. The lack of warming chinook influences ensures that Gillam is colder than Fairbanks, Alaska despite the fact the latter is eight degrees latitude farther north and a greater distance from the sea.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census, Statistics Canada the Town of Gillam had a population of 1,265 living in 436 of its 586 total dwellings, a -5.0% change from its 2011 population of 1,332. The population of Gillam is expected to double to triple within the next 5‚Äì10 years, due to several proposed hydroelectric projects in the area.  Amenities  Gillam shopping centre Gillam Recreation Centre offers a movie theatre, ice skating, hockey, curling, a gymnasium, a weight room, meeting rooms, a youth activity room and a library. There are also many small businesses, a small mall, a locally owned pharmacy, grocery store, school (K-12), Canada Post office, Co-op card lock/gas station, Co-op convenience store, Royal Canadian Legion, a train station and a local Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment. The Town of Gillam often has activities and events planned throughout the year. The Winter Carnival is an annual, week long series of events held in March. The Welcome Back Weekend is full of fun activities including the annual firework show which brings out a large portion of the town's population. This is held the weekend immediately after the Labour Day holiday. Popular summer activities in the Gillam area are fishing and boating on the many lakes and rivers, while hunters search for game animals such as bear, caribou, moose, wolf, ptarmigan and grouse. The town has community parks and playgrounds, and Pumphouse Beach is just away from town. The three hydroelectric dams near town may be toured with a guide. In colder months, snowmobilers have access to hundreds of miles of groomed trails. Transportation Gillam is situated on the Hudson Bay Railway line to Churchill and receives limited VIA rail passenger service at the Gillam railway station. Severe flooding in May 2017 caused several washouts, closing the line at Amery and suspending service beyond Gillam. Repairs were delayed due to a dispute with track owners OmniTRAX and full service did not resume until December 2018. Manitoba Provincial Road 280 links Gillam to the rest of Manitoba, making it one of the northernmost communities in the province accessible by year-round road.

The company was chartered and incorporated May 25, 1853, and started construction September 1, 1855. The horsecar line opened between West Cedar Street (just east of Charles Street) and Central Square on March 26, 1856. Extensions opened in April to Brattle House in Brattle Square and to Revere House in Bowdoin Square. A further extension to Mount Auburn Cemetery opened soon after, as did a branch to Porter Square. The connecting Watertown Horse Railroad opened on April 27, 1857. The Porter Square branch was extended to the border of West Cambridge (now Arlington); there it met the West Cambridge Horse Railroad, which opened on June 13, 1859. From its incorporation, the Cambridge Railroad was leased to the Union Railroad for 50 years, later passing under control of the West End Street Railway and the Boston Elevated Railway. The Red Line subway, opened March 23, 1912, now travels this route mostly underground, though the streetcar tracks remained for a while, possibly used by East Boston Tunnel (now Blue Line) trains until 1924 to travel to repair yards. The Red Line still travels over the Longfellow Bridge, successor to the West Boston Bridge, on the surface. The line beat a rival company by buying secondhand cars from the Brooklyn City Railroad. For the first two months, no fares were charged, making the line very popular, with over 2000 passengers per day within a week.

Early life Dixon was born in Gloucester, in the west of England, in 1939; and as a child lived at Stroud and later at Bramcote near Nottingham, where his father became principal of the People's College of Further Education. He was educated at Nottingham High School and then at the University of Oxford, where he took his first degree in mathematics in 1960, and finally at the University of Edinburgh, where he was a Research Fellow in Statistical Linguistics in the English department from July 1961 to September 1963. After that until September 1964 he did field work for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in north-east Queensland, working on several of the Aboriginal languages of Australia, but taking a particular interest in Dyirbal.Robert Dixon at research.jcu.edu.au, accessed 25 April 2015 Career =Research= Dixon has written on many areas of linguistic theory and fieldwork, being particularly noted for his work on the languages of Australia and the Araw√° languages of Brazil. He has published grammars of Dyirbal, Yidi…≤, Warrgamay, Nyawaygi, and Mbabaram. He published a comprehensive grammar of Boumaa Fijian, a Polynesian language (1988), and Jarawara, an Araw√° language from southern Amazonia (2004), for which he received the Leonard Bloomfield Book Award from the Linguistic Society of America. Dixon's work in historical linguistics has been highly influential. Based on a careful historical comparative analysis, Dixon questions the concept of Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages for which he argues sufficient evidence has never been provided. He also proposes a new \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" model, based on the theory of the same name in evolutionary biology, which is more appropriate for numerous language regions, including the Australian languages. Dixon puts forth his theory in The Rise and Fall of Languages, refined in his monograph Australian Languages: their nature and development (2002). Dixon is the author of a number of other books including Australian Languages: Their Nature and Development and Ergativity. His monumental three-volume work, Basic Linguistic Theory (2010‚Äì2012), was published by the Oxford University Press. His further work on Australian languages was published in Edible gender, mother-in-law style, and other grammatical wonders: Studies in Dyirbal, Yidi√± and Warrgamay, 2015. His further influential monographs include work on English grammar, especially A new approach to English grammar (1991, revised edition 2005), and Making New Words: Morphological Derivation in English (2014). His recent monograph Are Some Languages Better than Others (2016, paperback 2018) poses a question of efficiency and value of different languages. His editorial work includes four volumes of Handbook of Australian Languages (with Barry Blake), a special issue of Lingua on ergativity, and, jointly with Alexandra Aikhenvald, numerous volumes on linguistic typology in the series Explorations in Linguistic Typology, the fundamental The Amazonian languages (1999), and The Cambridge Handbook of Linguistic Typology (2017).

The depression includes the lowland regions of southwestern British Columbia and northwestern Washington along the shores of the Salish Sea. Formation The Georgia Depression was formed out of the collision of continental plates about 150 million years ago. During this period, the depression manifested as a broad valley with various rivers flowing down into it to reach the Pacific Ocean where the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca lies.Environmental History and Features of Puget Sound , NOAA- NWFSC Much of the current topography was formed through the erosion of the depression by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Vashon Glaciation, which lasted from about 19,000 ‚Äì 16,000 BP. The retreat of the ice sheet revealed a scarred landscape that filled in with sea water once it had retreated beyond what is now the Strait of Juan de Fuca, forming the Salish Sea. Geography The Georgia Depression is encompassed by the Pacific Ranges to the north, Vancouver Island Ranges and Olympic Mountains to the west, and North Cascades to the east. The depression includes the Fraser Lowland, Nanaimo and Nahwitti lowlands of Vancouver Island, Puget Sound basin, and all the islands and adjoining waterways of the Salish Sea. The majority of the population of British Columbia and Washington reside within this depression. Geology The landscape features glacially striated tablelands and rolling hills underlain by sedimentary rocks. The majority of soils in the depression are formed from glacial till, glacial outwash, and Lacustrine deposits. Ecology Much of the Georgia Depression is dry, flat, and at low elevation relative to the surrounding highlands. As such, a wide diversity of flora and fauna thrive within the depression. Human activity has greatly altered much of the natural environment here through industrialization, agriculture, forestry, urbanization, and suburban sprawl.

It has an inertial navigation system, a data-link for mid-course guidance and active radar homing for terminal guidance, beyond visual range. It also has ECCM capability and can engage multiple targets. According to Su Tzu-yun, Chief Executive Officer at the Center for Advanced Technology at Tamkang University, they are a cost- effective design which can perform a key role in Taiwan's defense strategy, and substantially offset China‚Äôs air superiority. Some details of its design were revealed for the first time at the Paris Air Show in 2015. The pulse doppler radar seeker reportedly has a detection range of 9.3km. Development Development of the Sky Sword II family began during the 1990s. Service history In 2017 a Sky Sword II launched by a F-CK-1 during a training exercise failed to ignite and fell into the sea. In 2019 TC-1 and TC-2 models were among 117 missiles fired during a training exercise off Taiwan‚Äôs west coast. Variants TC-II Sky Sword 2 (original air-to-air version) =TC-2N= A ship-launched, surface-to-air version was later developed and designated TC-2N. It began development in 1994, and a ground- based test was first carried out against a low-flying drone in 1997. This development was revealed to the public in 2005 and the intention to make it compatible with vertical launch methods was later announced in 2006. The first ship-based launch was held in mid 2014. In the naval role the TC-2N fills an air defense gap between the Phalanx CIWS and SM-2 systems and with a range of 30km. The missile has all-weather capability, is equipped with a thrust- vectoring booster to increase its range as well as maneuverability during launch phase (although early ship-based launch trials were carried out without this feature), and can engage anti-ship missiles and aircraft. It also has folding control surfaces to be quad-packed into either above-deck oblique launchers or in-deck vertical launch systems. = TC-2A = TC-2A is an anti- radiation missile, similar to the AGM-88 HARM. The TC-2A program began soon after the completion of the TC-2. It fills the requirement of the ROCAF for an Anti-Radiation Missile to arm the F-CK-1. It is reported to be 3.593 meters long, 19 cm in diameter, weighs 184 kg (warhead weighs 22 kg), and with a range of 100 km. The passive radar seeker on the TC-2A has been reported as having a detection range of 92km. = TC-2C = TC-2C is an advanced air-to- air version first tested in 2017 and intended to replace the standard TC-2. It features a number of incremental improvements including an improved rocket motor which allows an engagement range of 100km.speed amounted to Mach 6. = Surface-to-Air TC-2 = The land based version of the TC-2N features the missile packaged in a sealed container-launcher. NCSIST has exhibited a truck mounted version with four missile pods. The TC-2 air-defense system was exhibited at International Defence Exhibition in Abu Dhabi with a reported canister length of 4m and an all up weight (combined canister and round) of 350kg. It reportedly has midcourse inertial guidance with data link and terminal active radar guidance and electronic counter-countermeasure (EECM) and protection, but a reported effective range of only 15km.

After the dynasty's collapse, surviving ruling family members collectively changed their surname from Â≠ê(pinyin: z«ê; Wade-Giles: tzu) (the royal surname) to the name of their fallen capital and country, Yin (ÊÆ∑). The family remained members of the aristocratic class. They often provided administrative services to the Zhou Dynasty who succeeded them.

Monahan (born November 3, 1960) is an American screenwriter and novelist. His second produced screenplay was The Departed, a film that earned him a Writers Guild of America Award and Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Writer and editor Monahan was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. He moved to New York City and contributed to the alternative weekly newspaper New York Press and the magazines Talk, Maxim, and Spy. In 1997 Monahan won a Pushcart Prize for his short story \\"A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo\\". Monahan was an editor at Spy during the magazine's final years, where he would come in at the close of the monthly issue to rewrite articles and improve jokes. Monahan wrote a novel titled Light House: A Trifle, and Warner Bros. optioned the film rights. In 1999 Talk magazine debuted, and Monahan contributed a travelogue on Gloucester, Massachusetts, to the first issue. In 2000 Monahan's first novel, Light House: A Trifle, was finally published, and it garnered critical acclaim; The New York Times proclaimed, \\"Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along\\" and BookPage Fiction called Monahan \\"a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis.\\" In the second half of 2001 Monahan wrote a fictional column at the New York Press under the pseudonym of Claude La Badarian, which ran for 13 weeks. Screenwriting career Warner Bros. optioned the film rights to the novel Light House: A Trifle. The screenplay adaptation has not been produced. Light House was released in 2000. A few years later, he bought back the rights and took the novel off the market. In 2001 20th Century Fox bought Monahan's spec script Tripoli, about William Eaton's epic march on Tripoli during the Barbary Wars, in a deal worth mid-six figures in American dollars, with Mark Gordon attached as producer. The script was given to Ridley Scott to direct. Monahan met with Scott to discuss Tripoli, and Scott mentioned his desire to direct a film about knights. Monahan suggested the Crusades as a setting, reasoning that \\"you've got every conceivable plot imaginable there, which is far more exotic than fiction\\". Scott was captivated by Monahan's pitch and hired him to write the screenplay for Kingdom of Heaven. Tripoli was eventually shelved, but Monahan retained ownership of the screenplay and therefore the right to consider new offers at a later date. Monahan steadily secured work in the film industry throughout the 2000s. Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, hired Monahan to write an adaptation of Hong Kong director Andrew Lau's gangster film Infernal Affairs. Monahan respun Infernal Affairs as a battle between Irish American gangsters and cops in Boston's Southie district, and Martin Scorsese directed the completed screenplay under the title The Departed for Warner Bros. Monahan's work on the film would later earn him two Best Adapted Screenplay awards, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards. =Working scripts through production and after= Kingdom of Heaven was the first of Monahan's screenplays to be produced into a film. Monahan had negotiated a production write-through contract for Kingdom of Heaven, which allowed him to be present on the movie sets to make modifications to the shooting script during production. It was poorly received by critics when it was released in theaters in 2005. Kingdom was critically reappraised when it was released on DVD in the form of a director's cut that contained an additional 45 minutes of footage previously shot from Monahan's shooting script. Some critics were pleased with the extended version of the film. Monahan's second produced screenplay was The Departed, an adaptation of the Hong Kong action film Infernal Affairs. Jack Nicholson, one of the leads in the film, influenced the screenplay. \\"I had written the role as a post-sexual 68-year-old Irishman. Jack is post-sexual exactly never,\\" Monahan said later. \\"What Jack did is great. Did he change the words? Not any of the good ones.\\" Monahan received considerable praise from critics when the film was released in theaters, in 2006, and was applauded for accurately depicting the city of Boston. Monahan used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the many neighborhoods of Boston, to create characters that The Boston Globe described as distinctly indigenous to the city. By the end of 2006 The Departed had won many critics' prizes. Monahan was honored by The Boston Society of Film Critics with the award for best screenplay, by the Chicago Film Critics Association for best adapted screenplay, and by the Southeastern Film Critics Association with another best adapted screenplay award. Monahan took an unusual route for a screenwriter and hired a publicist to run a campaign promoting his screenplay during awards season. Monahan ended up winning two Best Adapted Screenplay awards for The Departed, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards. He received an award for his writing in film at the US-Ireland Alliance‚Äôs second annual \\"Oscar Wilde: Honoring Irish Writing in Film\\" ceremony. =Producing and directing= In 2006 Monahan negotiated a first-look producing deal with Warner Bros., which gives the studio the first right of first refusal on any films produced by Henceforth, a production company he started. In return Henceforth received the film rights to produce John Pearson's true crime novel The Gamblers, which Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to. In 2007 Monahan was hired to work on two film projects: an adaptation of the Hong Kong film Confession of Pain and an original rock and roll film, The Long Play. Monahan will executive produce and write the adaptation for Confession of Pain. The adaptation of Confession of Pain will be produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, for Warner Bros. Pictures. Monahan's other assignment is to rewrite a screenplay about the history of the rock music business called The Long Play. The Long Play is the creation of Mick Jagger, lead singer of The Rolling Stones, and was nurtured at Jagger's production company, Jagged Films.

Since his parents have never married, Grimaldi- Coste is not in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. Background Born out of wedlock as √âric Alexandre St√©phane Tossoukp√©, his mother changed her surname to Coste on 10 November 2004. Daughter of a merchant in Togo where she grew up, she became a student in France when she was 17. She was a flight attendant on an Air France plane en route from the French Riviera to Paris in July 1997 when Albert, a passenger, asked for her phone number, subsequently engaging in a relationship with her for several years until, allegedly, Albert's father, Prince Rainier III, demanded that he end the affair. Coste told Paris Match that she became pregnant only after a visit to celebrate her 31st birthday turned into a tryst. Albert provided for and visited mother and child promising, according to Coste, to legally acknowledge the child after a DNA test confirmed his paternity. When he did not do so, Coste offered the interview and photographs to the media. Albert made no public comment on media speculation, being in official mourning following the death of his father. Although he successfully sued Paris-Match for invasion of privacy, he did acknowledge paternity of the child in a statement issued by his attorney, Thierry Lacoste, on 6 July 2005. In an April 2014 interview Nicole Coste noted that she had legally changed Alexandre's surname to Grimaldi-Coste, adding the dynastic name used by the princely family. Status Out-of-wedlock children are not in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne according to Article 10 of the Constitution of Monaco, as amended 2 April 2002 by law n¬∞1.249, which specifies that only \\"direct and legitimate\\" descendants of Monaco's monarch (or of the monarch's siblings) may inherit the throne. Article 227 of the Monegasque Civil Code provides that if the parents of a (non-adulterine) child marry, the child is legitimized ipso facto (as happened in 1995 when Princess St√©phanie of Monaco married the father of two of her children). A child born out of wedlock may be legitimated in Monaco: Article 226-9 of the Monegasque Civil Code specifies that \\"the legitimization can benefit all children born out of wedlock provided that, by voluntary acknowledgement or by court judgement, their parentage has been lawfully established with regard to their two parents\\". The law of the principality stipulates, however, that a child of the reigning prince born out-of-wedlock may only inherit the throne if he weds the child's mother.Bremner, Charles. (1 June 2006) ‚ÄòCareless‚Äô Prince recognises second illegitimate child. The Times. On 26 October 2006, Albert II gave an interview to USA television personality Larry King during which he said his two eldest children would not be in line for the Monegasque throne but that they would be taken care of financially. They are also heirs to Prince Albert II's personal fortune, estimated at more than one billion dollars: Upon joining the Council of Europe on 5 October 2004, Monaco became subject to the European Convention on Human Rights regulations on inheritance rights, in addition to its own national laws, which guarantees familial inheritance for children born out of wedlock. History Illegitimate children are nothing new in the Princely Family of Monaco ‚Äî in every generation for the last 100 years a Grimaldi has had an acknowledged illegitimate child. Some of these have obtained succession rights through legitimation or adoption, including Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, an illegitimate child who was adopted by her own father, and who then ceded her succession rights to her son Rainier, 30 May 1944. Prince Rainier III made obtaining succession rights in this manner impossible for the illegitimate children of his son Albert by adopting a new constitutional amendment in 2002, which limited the succession to direct, legitimate issue.

Carrier; and Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies (2004), Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit. Occidentalism is often a counterpart to the term orientalism as used by Edward Said in his book of that title, which refers to and identifies Western stereotypes of the Eastern world, the Orient. Occidental representations In China \\"Traditions Regarding Western Countries\\" became a regular part of the Twenty-Four Histories from the 5th century CE, when commentary about The West concentrated upon on an area that did not extend farther than Syria. The extension of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries established, represented, and defined the existence of an \\"Eastern world\\" and of a \\"Western world\\". Western stereotypes appear in works of Indian, Chinese and Japanese art of those times. At the same time, Western influence in politics, culture, economics and science came to be constructed through an imaginative geography of West and East. Occidentalism debated In Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies (2004), Buruma and Margalit said that nationalist and nativist resistance to the West replicates Eastern-world responses against the socio- economic forces of modernization, which originated in Western culture, among utopian radicals and conservative nationalists who viewed capitalism, liberalism, and secularism as forces destructive of their societies and cultures. While the early responses to the West were a genuine encounter between alien cultures, many of the later manifestations of Occidentalism betray the influence of Western ideas upon Eastern intellectuals, such as the supremacy of the nation-state, the Romantic rejection of rationality, and the spiritual impoverishment of the citizenry of liberal democracies. Buruma and Margalit trace that resistance to German Romanticism and to the debates, between the Westernisers and the Slavophiles in 19th-century Russia, and show that like arguments appear in the ideologies of Zionism, Maoism, Islamism, and Imperial Japanese nationalism. Nonetheless, Alastair Bonnett rejects the analyses of Buruma and Margalit as Eurocentric, and said that the field of Occidentalism emerged from the interconnection of Eastern and Western intellectual traditions.

She was the third woman to ever serve as a U.S. Senator, and the first from Louisiana. Life and work Long in 1936 Rose McConnell was born in Greensburg, Indiana. She met Huey Long after she won a cake baking contest that he had organized to promote a product he was selling at the time. After a two-and-a-half year courtship, Rose and Huey were married in 1913. The next year he turned to the study of law, and became a lawyer after passing the bar. They had three children together. Huey Long became a highly successful politician, elected as governor of Louisiana in 1928 and then US Senator from Louisiana in 1930. After Huey's assassination in 1935, Rose Long was appointed to serve in his seat in the United States Senate until a special election could be held. She won the special election on April 21, 1936, to serve the remaining months of her husband's term, but she declined to run that fall for re-election to a full six-year term. Because Hattie Caraway (D-Arkansas) was already serving in the Senate when Rose Long was elected, it marked the first time that two women had ever served simultaneously in that body. Rose Long died in Boulder, Colorado, in 1970, where she lived near her daughter, Rose Lolita Long McFarland. She was also survived by her sons, Palmer Reid Long of Shreveport, Louisiana, and Russell B. Long, then the sitting United States Senator from Louisiana. Legacy Mrs. Long was portrayed by Ann Dowd in the 1995 television movie Kingfish: A Story of Huey Long. On February 1, 2014, Mrs. Long was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Six others were honored as well, including John S.

Edwards was a Democratic member of the United States Senate in 1972 appointed by her husband, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, following the death of Allen Ellender. She was the First Lady of Louisiana for twelve non-consecutive years from 1972 to 1980 and again from 1984 to 1988, making her the state's longest-serving First Lady. In her later years, she was a small fashion businesswoman and a low-profile soap opera actress based in New York City. Early life Edwards was born in Marksville, the seat of Avoyelles Parish, to Errol Leo Schwartzenburg and Myrl Dupuy Schwartzenburg Elaine was baptized Catholic, and had two brothers, Frank (1928‚Äì2013), and Ralph (born 1936). She married Edwin Edwards in 1949. Her own Catholic belief was the impetus for Edwin's reversion to the Catholic faith. An observer noted that Elaine Edwards \\"wanted the opposite of what Edwin wanted. She hated the fishbowl of politics.\\"Leo Honeycutt, Edwin Edwards: Governor of Louisiana, Lisburn Press, 2009, pg. 82 Both graduated from Marksville High School.

She did not live full-time at the Governor's mansion during her husband's third term, instead spending most of her time at the family's compound in southeastern Baton Rouge which they purchased during the term of Edwin's successor/predecessor, David C. Treen. On August 1, 1972, after the death of Allen Ellender, Edwin Edwards appointed Elaine to the U.S. Senate to serve the remaining few months of Ellender's term. In reaction to her Senate appointment, Edwards said: \\"This is a marvelous opportunity, and I accept it. But let's have no misgivings. I‚Äôm not a United States senator\\". Edwards did not seek election in November 1972. She resigned immediately upon certification of J. Bennett Johnston (whom her husband had defeated in the Democratic primary in the previous year's election for Governor) as the winner of the November 7, 1972 general election (in which Ellender had been a candidate until his death), allowing Johnston to gain seniority over other new senators elected on the same date. During the 1976 presidential election campaign, Elaine endorsed Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter, while her husband first endorsed California governor Jerry Brown, and later endorsed Carter after Brown failed to obtain the nomination. In 1983, Edwin Edwards was re-elected as Governor thus making Elaine first lady again this time serving until 1988. Post-political career After her senate tenure, Edwards owned a small business producing custom-made dresses and would continue this business even while serving as first lady during her husband‚Äôs third term in the 1980s. She moved to New York City in the 1990s to find occasional work as a soap opera actress. Personal life and death Edwin and Elaine Edwards divorced in 1989 after forty years of marriage.

He was educated at Link√∂ping Gymnasium. He then studied science at the University of Uppsala, graduating BSc in 1912. He received his Ph.D. and a docentship in paleontology from Uppsala University in 1921 and became professor and keeper at the Zoopaleontological (later called the Paleozoological) department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm in 1923, a position he held until his retirement in 1959. Stensi√∂ specialized in the anatomy and evolution of \\"lower\\" vertebrates. His studies of placoderms showed them to be related to modern sharks (though, now, placoderms are considered to be the sister group of all jawed vertebrates, in addition to sharks). His first major work, Triassic fishes from Spitzbergen (part I: Vienna 1921; part II: Stockholm 1925), was based on material collected during his expeditions to Spitzbergen in 1912, 1913, 1915 and 1916. For his work, The Downtonian and Devonian Vertebrates of Spitzbergen, Part I, Stensi√∂ was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1926. In 1917 he changed his name from Andersson to Stensio, adopting the name of his home-town. He founded the so-called \\"Stockholm School\\" in paleozoology, continued notably by his successors in the professorship, Erik Jarvik and Tor √òrvig. Stensi√∂ was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1927 and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1946. He received the Wollaston Medal in 1953, and the Linnean Medal of the Linnean Society of London in 1957. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. He died on 11 January 1984 at the Danderyd Hospital in Stockholm. Family He was married to Aina Laurell.

It won the 1982 Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize. He received a ¬£1000 advance from publishers Faber and Faber for the novel after a meeting with Robert McCrum, the fiction editor. A Pale View of Hills is the story of Etsuko, a middle-aged Japanese woman living alone in England, and opens with discussion between Etsuko and her younger daughter, Niki, about the recent suicide of Etsuko's older daughter, Keiko. Plot summary During a visit from her daughter, Niki, Etsuko reflects on her own life as a young woman in Japan, and how she left that country to live in England. As she describes it, she and her Japanese husband, Jiro, had a daughter together, and a few years later Etsuko met a British man and moved with him to England. She took her elder daughter, Keiko, to England to live with her and the new husband. When Etsuko and her new husband have a daughter, Etsuko wants to call her something \\"modern\\" and her husband wants an Eastern-sounding name, so they compromise with the name \\"Niki,\\" which seems to Etsuko to be perfectly British, but sounds to her husband at least slightly Japanese. In England, Keiko becomes increasingly solitary and antisocial. Etsuko recalls how, as Keiko grew older, she would lock herself in her room and emerge only to pick up the dinner-plate that her mother would leave for her in the kitchen. This disturbing behavior ends, as the reader already has learned, in Keiko's suicide. \\"Your father,\\" Etsuko tells Niki, \\"was rather idealistic at times...[H]e really believed we could give her a happy life over here... But you see, Niki, I knew all along. I knew all along she wouldn't be happy over here.\\"Kazuo Ishiguro, A Pale View of Hills, pp.176 Etsuko tells her daughter, Niki, that she had a friend in Japan named Sachiko. Sachiko had a daughter named Mariko, a girl whom Etsuko's memory paints as exceptionally solitary and antisocial. Sachiko, Etsuko recalls, had planned to take Mariko to America with an American soldier identified only as \\"Frank.\\" Clearly, Sachiko's story bears striking similarities to Etsuko's. CharactersEtsuko - main protagonist; middle- aged Japanese woman *Keiko - Etsuko's elder daughter who commits suicide *Niki - Etsuko's second daughter, by her English husband *Sachiko - woman known to Etsuko, and, possibly, a third person on whom Etsuko projects bad memories, thoughts, and events *Mariko - Sachiko's daughter, and, possibly, a representation of Etsuko's daughter, Keiko *Jiro - Etsuko's first husband *Ogata-san - Jiro's father *Frank - man that Sachiko was going to America with *Mrs. Fujiwara - the owner of noodle shop who gave Sachiko a job *Hanada - Jiro's friend who threatened his wife with a golf club *Shigeo Matsuda - a student in Ogata-san's class  Reception  The novel was generally well received by critics, many praising the novel's mysterious tone. The New York Review of Books called it \\"eery and tenebrous. It is a ghost story but the narrator does not realise that.\\" The New York Times said the novel was \\"infinitely ... mysterious\\", and the inconsistent tone of the narrator, with the graphic imagery in the book combined to create \\"the absolute emblem of our genius of destruction\\".

It is a popular Icelandic liquor and special-occasion alcohol shot, and the traditional drink for the mid-winter feast of √ûorrabl√≥t. It is made from fermented grain or potato mash and flavoured with caraway, and for this reason can be considered an aquavit. The steeping of herbs in alcohol to create schnapps is a long-held folk tradition in Nordic countries. Brenniv√≠n has a taste similar to vodka or Scandinavian akvavit. It is typically bottled at 37.5 or 40% ABV (75 or 80 proof). Etymology The word \\"brenniv√≠n\\" means \\"burning wine\\" and comes from the same root as brandy, namely brandewijn, which has its roots in the Dutch language (also compare German Branntwein and Afrikaans brandewyn). A variation of the same word is used in other North Germanic languages. In Swedish the liquor is referred to as \\"br√§nnvin\\", in Danish as \\"br√¶ndevin\\", in Norwegian as \\"brennevin\\" and in Faroese as \\"brenniv√≠n\\". The product was introduced in 1935, after prohibition ended in Iceland. The bottle contained a white skull on the black label, in order to warn against consumption, later replaced by the map of Iceland. Therefore, it was sometimes called \\"svarti dau√∞i\\" (black death). Serving Brenniv√≠n is typically served cold and in a shot glass. It is the traditional accompaniment to the uniquely Icelandic h√°karl, a type of fermented shark meat. Branding Various Icelandic breweries produce different brands of brenniv√≠n, which all have their own character although loyal to the old brenniv√≠n once produced by the state-owned monopoly √ÅTVR. Availability outside Iceland Export of Brenniv√≠n from Iceland to the United States began in early 2014. The American definition and image of schnapps is historically very different to that of Europe and rest of the world. The U.S. label for Brennivin does not contain the word \\"schnapps\\" as schnapps is specifically defined by U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Formulation as a \\"liqueur,\\" a flavoured spirit product containing sugar in an amount not less than 2.5% by weight. As Brennivin does not contain any added sugar, it is instead labeled in the U.S. as \\"Aquavit,\\" an approved TTB class and type of formulation of caraway- flavoured distilled spirits. In popular cultureIn music: \\"Brennivin\\" is the name of a song on the Seal Beach EP of The Album Leaf project. A song \\"Brennivin\\" appears on the Faroese band T√Ωr's album, Land. *In films: Icelandic films such as Kristnihald undir J√∂kli, Land og synir, Stuttur Frakki, Dj√∂flaeyjan, Ingal√≥, Cold Fever, and others have featured the drink. *In a Japanese webcomic The character Iceland, in the Japanese webcomic Hetalia: Axis Powers, involves this drink in his song, \\"With Love, From Iceland\\".

Description Monoporeia affinis measures up to long when fully grown, with two pairs of antennae and one pair of black eyes. The legs arising from the first three segments of the abdomen are expanded basally to form broad plates. Monoporeia affinis closely resembles another benthic amphipod, Pontoporeia femorata, which can be distinguished from M. affinis by its light red eyes. Ecology M. affinis is one of the Baltic glacial relicts. Originally a freshwater species, it also exists in lakes. M. affinis lives on soft bottoms, sometimes even as densely as 10,000‚Äì20,000 but usually hundreds to thousands of individuals per square metre. The amphipod has an important role in bioturbation (mixing and oxidating the bottom sediment). Monoporeia feeds on phytoplankton and decomposed organic matter sinking onto the bottom. M. affinis is itself the prey of Saduria entomon, Harmothoe sarsi (a polychaete) and fishes such as cod, herring and the fourhorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus quadricornis. The increasing loss of oxygen in the Baltic Sea bottoms ‚Äì especially in the Gulf of Finland ‚Äì has lately been affecting the M. affinis population, since its eggs and embryos are very sensitive to lack of oxygen. Thus M. affinis is often used as an indicator species of the state bodies of water. Life cycle After mating in the autumn and bearing over the winter, the female M. affinis gives birth to 20‚Äì30 offspring, which only happens once during its 2‚Äì4 year lifespan. Taxonomic history Monoporeia affinis was originally described in the genus Pontoporeia by Gustaf Lindstr√∂m in 1855. It was moved to the new genus Monoporeia by Edward L. Bousfield in 1989, alongside two other species, \\"M. microphthalma\\" and \\"M. gurjanovae\\", which are now considered synonyms of M. affinis.

It was dedicated in 1925 as Point Loma Junior-Senior High school, serving grades 7 through 12. There were 386 students at its opening on September 22, 1925. The first principal was Pete Ross and there were 30 teachers. Some San Diegans opposed creating a school in Point Loma, contending it was too far away from town, but school board member Edgar F. Hastings pushed the proposal through. In its early days the school was sometimes referred to as \\"Hastings' folly\\".Held, Ruth Varney, \\"Beach Town\\", privately published, San Diego, 1975, page 109 The original three-story high school building was torn down in the 1970s as part of a statewide requirement to make all schools earthquake-safe.

In 1983 it became a four-year high school. PLHS now draws from six elementary schools serving grades kindergarten through 4, and two middle schools: Dana Middle for grades 5 and 6, and Correia Middle for grades 7 and 8. The school holds the distinction of having produced two major-league baseball pitchers who threw perfect games - David Wells and Don Larsen. Only 21 pitchers have thrown perfect games in Major League Baseball history. Wells also threw a perfect game while a student at PLHS. Wells became the school's head baseball coach starting with the 2014-2015 school year. He had been volunteering as an assistant coach for several years. The team's home field was named David Wells Field in 2010. Demographics Point Loma High School is the third largest of 16 high schools in the San Diego Unified School District. It is a four-year, comprehensive high school, serving grades 9‚Äì12. It houses a student population of approximately 2000 students who come primarily from the local community. Approximately 35 percent of the student body participates in specialized programs, such as the Voluntary Ethnic Enrollment Program (VEEP), the Choice Program, the Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) program, or the Seminar Program.

Debuted in 1996, the series has only had five games published so far, and after being in the hands of Krisalis Software, Silicon Dreams Studio and Konami, the license now lies in the hands of EA. Krisalis (1996‚Äì1998) Krisalis Software had a strong history of football video games in the past, and inclusively released European Club Soccer, a game that simulated the old knockout format in 1992. With the official branding, Krisalis worked on a 3D engine, fitted with the Tacti-grid and gameplay in the line of their older games. It had all 16 teams present in the 1996/1997 Champions League with the actual groups, plus national teams. Only one title was produced, distributed by Philips Media. Silicon Dreams (1998‚Äì2002) With Silicon Dreams Studio, who also developed the World League Soccer series, Champions League had four titles, 98‚Äì99, Season 1999‚Äì2000, Season 2000‚Äì2001 and 2001‚Äì2002 released, aimed mostly at the PlayStation, but PC releases existed for the games. It replaced the national teams with finalists of all competitions since 1960, also including scenarios (in 98‚Äì99, with fake settings, in 1999‚Äì2000, based on the previous finals, including the 1999 final last minutes). The first two games were published by Eidos Interactive, whilst the last two were published by Take-Two Interactive. EA Sports (2004‚Äì2007, 2019‚Äì) In November 2004, Electronic Arts announced a brand-new licensing deal and further development of the game, which was published before the second round of the 2004‚Äì05 competition started. It used the same FIFA engine, and was now the fourth licensed football title EA has in its catalogue. UEFA Champions League 2004‚Äì2005 was released in early 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and Windows and had licenses to many leagues in Europe, stadiums including Stamford Bridge and Anfield and also licenses to the players for the clubs. Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray did the commentary for the game and the graphics and gameplay were taken from FIFA Football 2005, released in 2004. A career mode was made into the game where a player had to win the Champions League with various scenarios. EA Sports Talk Radio - a feature previously featured in games such as Madden NFL 2005 - was incorporated into the career mode, and was presented by Patrick Kinghorn and ex-footballer Tony Cascarino. It was also the only UEFA-based video game to be released for the GameCube. UEFA Champions League 2006‚Äì2007 was released by EA Sports on 23 March 2007. There are four versions of the game, one for the PS2, one for the PSP, one for the PC and one for the Xbox 360. The game modes differ among PS2, PSP and 360. The PSP, PS2 and PC versions were developed by HB Studios while the Xbox 360 version was developed by EA Canada. The UEFA Champions League returned to EA Sports in FIFA 19, as EA secured the license after the deal between Konami and UEFA expired. The tournament is available as a standalone tournament mode, in The Journey, Career Mode and in FIFA Ultimate Team related content, with Derek Rae and Lee Dixon as commentators for the tournament. Konami (2008‚Äì2018) On 11 September 2008, Konami officially released the news that they had secured a four-year deal for the rights of the Champions League beginning with Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 and ending with Pro Evolution Soccer 2012. The deal allowed Konami to use the details of the UEFA Champions League in a separate game mode within the game, UEFA Champions League A 4 year deal for PES In 2012, Konami has had extended the deal for 1 more year to feature the UEFA Champions League again within Pro Evolution Soccer 2013.UEFA Champions League License Extended 1 More Year In August 2013, Konami confirmed that PES 2015 will feature UEFA Champions League. In June 2015, Konami reached a deal with UEFA to hold the license until 2018.\\"Konami and UEFA Announce Three-Year Champions League License Renewal.\\" PESEdit Blog. 11 June 2015.

It was invented in the US by Josiah Vincent Meigs (also known as Joe Meigs or Joe Vincent Meigs), of Lowell, Massachusetts, and was demonstrated in a suburb of Boston called East Cambridge from 1886 to 1894.Robert Campbell and Peter Vanderwarker: \\"MEIGS ELEVATED RAILWAY\\" . Boston Globe, February 23, 1992.  History  =Joe Meigs= Josiah Vincent Meigs, who answered to \\"Joe\\", was born into a well-connected professional family of Nashville, Tennessee (his attorney father was a friend of Abraham Lincoln). He served as captain of the Union Army during the American Civil War, and made a personal appeal to President Lincoln for permission to raise a detachment of black troops for a colored artillery battery. This was the first of such to serve in the war.Tennessee Historical Quarterly 1983 p. 161 After the war he was a lawyer at Washington. There he became close friends with a fellow veteran, General Benjamin Butler, and the two moved together to Lowell, Massachusetts where they built adjacent houses. Butler became an influential state politician, and was to serve as governor from 1882.. Joe Meigs was proving himself to be a capable inventor, and was responsible for the Meigs rifle as well as taking out several other firearms patents. In the 1880 US census and in the 1889 Lowell city director, inventor was given as his profession.Young, Jan; Fashion in Steel: Streamlined Steam Locomotives in North America Lulu 2017 p.18 =Company= Joe Meigs thought out his rapid transit system in the early 1870s, and patented it in 1875. Compare the Aldershot narrow-gauge suspension railway, built in England in 1872. As a result of exploiting his social connections in Massachusetts, he attracted substantial backing including that of his friend General Butler. So, the two set up the Meigs Elevated Railway Company with Butler as president in 1881. The company hung out its shingle at 225 Bridge Street (now Monsignor O'Brien Highway) in East Cambridge, on a site in an industrial area previously occupied by the works of the Bay State Glass Company.The Mechanics of the Meigs Railway 1888 p. 3 It then began to lobby for a state charter to allow it to build rapid transit lines in the streets of Boston and its suburbs. The company was finally chartered under state law in 1884.Cheape, Charles W: Moving the Masses: Urban Public Transit in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, 1880-1912, Harvard University Press 1980 p. 123 The authorised share capital was $200 000 (about $5 000 000 in 2020 values). However the company was not yet free to construct publicly, because the charter required the approval of Boston City Council for any construction within city limits. Instead, it allowed the building of a short experimental line at the East Cambridge site. The text included the following proviso: > No location for tracks shall be petitioned for in the city of Boston, until > at least one mile of the road has been built and operated, nor until the > safety and strength of the structure and the rolling stock and motive power > shall have been examined and approved by the board of railroad commissioners > or by a competent engineer to be appointed by them. Meigs amended his design, and acquired a new patent in 1885. =Demonstration= The company raised $20 000 cash (about $500 000 in 2020 values), which was enough to build a full-sized experimental model comprising a short section of the elevated railway. This was to demonstrate the benefits and capabilities of the system under widely varying parameters, as demanded by the charter. The 227-foot (69 metre) iron demonstration line was erected on land abutting company headquarters in Bridge Street, and was opened to paying riders in June 1886.Young, Jan; Fashion in Steel: Streamlined Steam Locomotives in North America Lulu 2017 p.19. The company was permitted to run its line over Bridge Street, to end on property occupied by the hog slaughterhouse of John P. Squire and Company.The Mechanics of the Meigs Railway 1888 p. 3 The actual erection was performed by a separate company founded by Meigs, the Meigs Elevated Railway Construction Company, which was intended to be in charge of construction of future lines.Maycock, Susan E: East Cambridge, Cambridge Historical Commission 1988 p. 79 The short length of demonstration line in iron was connected to the car shed by a longer wooden version, intended to test the capabilities of the system. This incorporated construction of several types, as discernible in a surviving photo of the setup. The rolling stock comprised three units: a locomotive, a tender and a passenger car. In July 1886, the Scientific American magazine published an article entitled The Meigs Elevated Railway and containing this assertion: > Everything has worked in the most satisfactory manner, the train rounding > the exceedingly sharp curves easily, and mounting the steep grades without > trouble. =Promotion= A fire, supposedly the result of arson, broke out on the night of Feb. 4, 1887 and destroyed Meigs's car shed as well as burning out the experimental coach. The locomotive and tender escaped. A photo survives of the damage, which Meigs claimed amounted to $10 000 ($250 000 in 2020 values). Meigs wrote an extensive explanation of how his urban transit system would function, complete with diagrams and statistics, and entitled it The Meigs Railway System: The Reasons For Its Departures From The Ordinary Practice. The work was published later in 1887,Meigs, Joe V., \\"The Meigs Railway System: The Reasons For Its Departures From The Ordinary Practice\\" 1887 (Boston: Charles H. Whiting). and followed by a privately published booklet, The Mechanics of the Meigs Railway, in 1888. However, no urban rapid transit company outside the Boston area made use of the system. The Lake Street Elevated Railroad of Chicago intended to use it when chartered in 1888, but changed its policy and settled on a conventional design before beginning construction.Middleton, William D: Metropolitan Railways, Rapid Transit in America 2003 p. 44 Some international interest was demonstrated in the same year by the publication in Paris, France of a work by Charles Thirion entitled Nouveau Syst√®me de Chemin de Fer A√©rien Monorail. Nothing came of this, either. This book shows an early use of the term \\"monorail\\" to describe the system. Also the Massachusetts charter was renewed in 1888, but in December of that year the first electric streetcar line in Boston was opened. The experimental establishment at East Cambridge was mothballed in 1891. Meigs continued campaigning for a line of his system from Boston to Cambridge, but was hostile to the new electric traction. In 1893, he published a booklet entitled True Rapid Transit wherein he rejected both the building of subways and the use of electric power, insisting that steam engines were more economical. In April of that year, the Cambridge experimental train made a single trial trip which was its last. The line was dismantled in 1894, not because of failure but because it had performed its function and Meigs expected to begin construction of a Boston to Cambridge line soon. name=\\"BG1992\\" =Failure= In July 1894, the Boston Elevated Railway company was incorporated to build a conventional elevated line from Boston to Cambridge, Roxbury, Charlestown and South Boston. Meigs acquired the franchise, but continued to refuse to countenance the use of electric power. This alienated investors and the public, and he was unable to raise any funds for construction. So, in 1896 he sold the franchise and gave up.Cheney, F: Boston's Red Line: Bridging the Charles from Alewife to Braintree, Arcadia 2002 p.6 The final failure of the Meigs Elevated Railway was owing to its being rejected by Boston investors. When the Boston Elevated Railway reverted to a conventional layout, the money problem went away and the first stretch of elevated line was opened in 1901. Joe Meigs died of a stroke at home in Charlestown in 1907, and was buried according to the rites of the Unitarian Church. =Remembrance= The Meigs system involved two lower load- bearing rails and a central gripper-traction rail, but it has habitually been referred to as a monorail in published sources despite not being one. There is a passing resemblance to the Lartigue Monorail, which in contrast had a central load-bearing rail and two lower guide rails. In 1876, the Cambridge Historical Commission began an campaign to attach Blue Oval Historical Markers to buildings on sites of historical importance. One was attached to the old Genoa Packing Company building, not at number 225 (which is the Alles Building) but at 221 next door. This was demolished in 2013, and replaced by the Fairfield Inn & Suites which is part of the Marriott chain. The plaque has not reappeared, and is listed by the commission as \\"marker not currently installed\\".. The text read: \\"Meigs' Experimental Railway. Joseph V. Meigs, inventor and entrepreneur, successfully tested a steam-powered elevated monorail train intended for rapid transit use in Boston. 1886.\\" In 2019 the digital artist Michael_C (real name Michael Crisafulli), of the Renderosity online artists' community, patented his virtual reality version of the Meigs system. Joe Meigs's extensive collection of papers and drawings relating to the system, as well as correspondence and genealogical material, is held at the Manuscripts and Archives Department of the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University. An early notebook of his, 1854‚Äì66, includes early sketches of parts of the system and is part of the MIT Libraries collections. Top view: Fig. 2 is a plan view of a train on a sharp curve, Fig. 3 is an end view of the track and the engine, Fig. 4 is a section through tender and track, and Fig. 5 is a section through the car Layout of experimental line The following description is based on a plan, with annotations, published in The Meigs Railway System: The Reasons For Its Departures From The Ordinary Practice, page 177.Meigs, Joe V., \\"The Meigs Railway System: The Reasons For Its Departures From The Ordinary Practice\\" 1887 (Boston: Charles H. Whiting) p. 177. The company's premises were on the north side of Bridge Street, number 225 (now Monsignor O'Brien Highway). This road runs roughly east to west. Just west of the company offices, adjacent to and parallel with the street, was a car shed with an adjacent workshop on its north side. Both ends of the shed had large doors through which the train could run. The experimental line (\\"trial road\\") began west of the shed and ran through it at just above ground level, but then rose on a continuous gradient of 2% round a 180 degree curve of 50 feet (15 metres) radius and 165 feet (50 metres) long. The line then ran west parallel to the north side of the car shed, before turning on a 45 degree curve before continuing south-west across the street to its terminus. This section to the second curve also had sections of grades, variable at 4.5%, 5.7% and finally 6.5% on the curve. Most of the construction was of wood, but the final section of 227 feet(69 metres) over the street was in iron as proposed for future rapid transit construction. Photos exist of the train posed on this section. The line had differing construction techniques: * Wooden construction of the cheapest possible kind, suitable \\"for yard use, not for traffic\\" -from the beginning of the line to the shed's west door. * Wooden construction, with low track following the contour of the ground -through the shed to the start of the main curve. * Wooden construction, with continuous grade secured by increasing the heights of the wooden support posts -around the main curve. * Wooden construction beginning level but with variable grades thereafter created by varying pole heights -end of main curve to end of second curve. The latter had the steepest grade, at 6.5%. * Iron construction, increasing in height until the street crossing was reached at a heigh of 14 feet (4.25 metres) above the ground was reached. Then came a level stretch across the street to the end buffers. This was deliberately built with a slight curve but out of straight track girders to show that the system did not need to have specially curved girders to negotiate shallower curves. A photo exists of the deliberately kinked track. Macke's Three-Rail System The Meigs system had a three-rail competitor proposed for Boston between 1888 and 1891, and discussed by the Massachusetts state legislature. Unlike with the Meigs system, no demonstration line was built. It featured two load-bearing rails and a third traction rail in a gully between the two, with vertical driving wheels attached to the rail by wrap-round flanges.Cheney & Sammarco: When Boston Rode the EL Arcadia 2000 p.12 Description of Meigs system =Overview= Block quotations in the following description are from the 1886 Scientific American article, and the description is based on this. The basic premise for the design of the system was to make the street-level footprint of the line as narrow as possible, to ameliorate the problem of shadowing created by conventional urban elevated railroads. This entailed a single row of iron pillars of variable height, connected by single horizontal girders. On top of these girders was a pair of load-bearing rails, close together. In between the rails was a row of short posts, bearing a thick third rail. Each item of rolling stock (locomotive, tender or passenger car) had two trucks or bogies, each with four wheels. These wheels were angled inwards to sit on the load- bearing rails. In addition, each truck had a pair of horizontal spring-mounted gripper wheels which pinched the central upper rail. In non-powered vehicles these were for stability and braking, but in the locomotive these provided the drive in addition. This central rail was not load-bearing. The gripper mechanism allowed trains to manage steep gradients. The rolling stock had the form of horizontal cylinders, including the locomotives, and the edges of the cylinders were rounded. This was an early example of the deliberate design feature of streamlining, which featured in publicity: > This system is as applicable for surface as for elevated railroads. It is > cheaper to build than an ordinary road, as the design of the rolling stock > allows the contour of the ground to be more closely followed. As an elevated > road in cities, the permanent structure presents far less obstruction to > light and air than the usual form. The center of gravity of the cars and > engine is brought down as low as possible, thereby lessening the effect of > leverage caused by wind pressure. The smooth, even surface of the exterior > of the entire train serve to decrease the resistance to the wind, and > permits a high rate of speed. =Permanent way= The following description is for the expected standard iron construction. As the experimental line demonstrated, much of the construction could have been replaced with wood (timber). The hollow iron support pillars were made up of two C-shaped bars, back to back and bolted together with two strap bars. No specifications were given for the cross- section, \\"which may be varied as demanded by location\\", but a standard pillar was suggested at 20 feet (6 metres) comprising 6 feet (1.8 metres) underground on foundations specified for the local geology and 14 feet (4.3 metres) clear, with an additional 4 feet (1.2 metres) occupied by the permanent way at the top. These pillars were to be free-standing, not stayed. The permanent way on which the trains were to run consisted, firstly of a line of single iron structural support girders on the tops of the pillars. On top of these was a line of narrower single girders or track beams (so-called) to which the load- bearing rails were to be fixed. A pair of U-shaped girders, facing upwards, was bolted to the sides of each track beam, and filled with longitudinal baulks of timber. The upper outer edges of the baulks were beveled at 45 degrees, and the rails fixed to the bevel surfaces so as to be angled out at the same inclination. The rails, baulks and track beam were fastened together with single bolts passing clear through. The gauge of the load-bearing rails was 22.5 inches (57 cm) between the outer edges. The support girders were not stayed, either. The track beams were interrupted by short posts 42 inches (107 cm) high and sitting on the support girders, and bearing the central traction rail (also referred to as the upper track beam) which was a girder 17.5 inches (44.5 cm) thick. This thickness included iron straps, replaceable when worn, which were fixed along the sides so as to leave a slot along the bottom of each side. The flanges of the horizontal gripper wheels fitted into these slots. The support posts were supplemented by diagonal trusses, as seen in photos of the experimental line. The experimental line did not feature junction arrangements, so these only appear in print. A swing bridge arrangement was envisaged: > A junction switch is formed of a single swinging section, turning upon a > hinge of great strength attached to one of the pillars. A movement of four > or five feet (1.2 to 1.5 metres) by the free end of the switch was enough to > permit the cars and trucks on one track to clear the end of the other track. > The free end travels upon a carriage provided with rollers, moving upon a > supporting rail. Suitable mechanism is provided for operating the switch and > locking it in place. The switch would have had to be operated manually, somehow. Neither the experimental line nor published illustrations gave any indications as to how routine inspection and maintenance of the permanent way were to have been carried out, without recourse to ladders or scaffolding erected in the street below. =Wheel system= Each item of rolling stock had two trucks or bogies, with four flanged load-bearing wheels each. The major peculiarity of the latter was that they were not vertical, but angled inwards: > Each truck consists of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, > stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to > its under side, in which were fixed short axles for the wheels. Each truck > had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being so > inclined. Since the axles were fixed, the bearings would have been in the wheel hubs. Also, each truck had a pair of horizontal gripper wheels, located in between the two pairs of load-bearing wheels which were about 4 feet (1.2 metres) apart. These gripper wheels were 42 inches (107 cm) in diameter and 3.5 inches (9 cm) thick, and the two wheels rotated independently of each other, not being coupled. They were also flanged, on their lower edges, and these flanges fitted into the slots in the sides of the central traction rail. The vertical wheel axles slotted into box slides fixed to the frame, containing springs which pushed the wheels against the rail. The functions of the wheels were, firstly, to stabilise the vehicle against any rolling motion and, secondly, to be part of the hydraulic braking system. Meigs considered that the braking power of the wheels was adequate, but allowed that the load-bearing wheels could be provided with brakes too. The flanges of the gripper wheels were to hold the vehicle onto the track, so that it was unable to fall off. However, the truck frame was also provided with lugs in the event of wheel assembly breakage: > In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision is made to prevent > the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, > which would slide upon but could not leave the way. The horizontal gripper wheel design was also followed by the separate pair of traction wheels on the locomotive. The vehicle undercarriage consisted of two chassis frames, connected by side trusses on which the vehicle body sat and to which was fixed the floor assembly. Each chassis frame had four vertical tubes containing heavy spiral springs, and these fitted into spring sockets bolted to the underneath of the floor assembly. The chassis frame was attached to its truck frame by a centre turn pin stayed by rods attached to sliders, so as to allow free rotation of the chassis on the truck. When running through curves, the trucks turned on the gripper wheels and it was claimed that the design allowed for very tight turning: > It has been found that, by reason of the independent motion of all the truck > wheels, curves were followed so closely that the increase of friction of the > car wheels passing through curves even as small as 50 feet radius, was too > slight to be noticed or measured in a model one-eighth full size. This > construction of the trucks would allow a car 50 feet (15 metres) long to > from a street only 28 feet (8.5 metres) wide into another of the same width. > Internal view =Passenger car= The floor of the passenger car was a frame > of C-channel beams of 5 inch (12.7 cm) gauge. It was 51.16 feet (15.6 > metres) long, and 7.5 feet (2.3 metres) wide. The cylindrical car body was > formed of hoops of light iron T-bars bent into a circle of diameter 10.7 > feet (3.26 metres). The publicity emphasised the luxuriousness of the > fitting out: > >> The cars possess many novel features, both outside and inside. The circular section and rounded ends admit of the strongest possible construction, without an overweight of material. The framing of the body is filled in by panels covered with rich upholstering, which covers all the interior. The exterior is sheathed with paper and copper. While adding to the strength, this form is expected to diminish the wind resistance fully one-third. The interior of the car is light, roomy, and pleasing to the eye. The seats are upholstered like the rest of the car, and comfort and luxury have been carefully studied in every detail.

They had vertical > steel (not iron) axles six inches (15 cm) thick. Each wheel had its own > driving mechanism, fed from a single boiler. The following is the Scientic > American description of the locomotive specifications: > >> The boiler was of the locomotive type (that is, a fire-tube boiler), 60 inches (152 cm) in diameter and 15 feet 94.6 metres) in length. It was placed over the driving mechanisms, its center line being 61 inches (155 cm) above the floor. There were 200 tubes, 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter and 7 feet (2.1 metres) long; the firebox was 4.5 feet (1.4 metres) square. The crown sheet was arched, and inclined downward at the back end to allow of climbing and descending grades equal to 15% without exposing any uncovered part to the fire (and so causing an explosion). The cylinders were 12 by 22 inches (30 by 56 cm); their center lines were placed 18 inches (45 cm) above the floor, and 61 inches (155 cm) apart. The piston rods connected with independent crossheads gliding upon steel girders, supported at their ends by standards bolted to the floor beams. The driving wheel axles extended through a sliding box containing the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron runners placed at right angle to the line of the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bellcranks. The throttle valve, link rod, brake and coupling rods, also the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided. Adhesion of the driving wheels to the rails was obtained by means of a cylinder and piston secured to the sliding boxes. The engineer had before him five hydraulic cocks, which adjusted the throttle, links, sliding boxes of the driving wheels, brakes and the coupling rods of the entire train, while just above were steam and hydraulic pressure gauges and indicators, whistle and bell ropes. > > The fireman was stationed behind the boiler, at the rear of the locomotive > and so well away from the engineer. The reference to a control for coupling > rods was as regards a claimed safety feature: > >> One turn of the cock controlling the couplings unlocked them and divided the train into its component cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed the momentum of the whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing cars of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks. > >  Gallery  File:Meigs Elevated Railway building.jpgThe railway site in > 2010.

Adventure Island was released in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 and in the PAL region in 1992 under the title of Adventure Island Classic. Adventure Island is an adaptation of the arcade game Wonder Boy, developed by Escape for Sega. Adventure Island was followed by a series of sequels with no connection to the Wonder Boy series. Plot The player controls Master Higgins (known as Takahashi Meijin in the Japanese version), a young man who ventured to Adventure Island in the South Pacific after hearing that the Evil Witch Doctor kidnapped Princess Tina. To rescue her, Higgins must survive a series of 32 stages. There are eight worlds called \\"areas\\", which are divided into four stages or \\"rounds\\" each, which are further divided into four checkpoints. When the player reaches the fourth round of each area, he must confront a boss at the end to continue to the next area. The game is completed when the player saves the girl after defeating the eighth and final form of the evil lord. Gameplay The first stage in the NES version. Master Higgins (the player character) loses a life whenever he touches an enemy, an enemy's attack, a fire roast, or when he falls into a pitfall or a body of water. The player also has a health gauge that starts out with 11 points, which gradually depletes over time or whenever Higgins trips on a rock in his path. When Higgins' health gauge reaches zero, he will lose a life. If Higgins still has extra lives, he will revive at the last checkpoint he passed through. The game ends when all of Higgins' lives run out. To replenish his health, Higgins can pick up fruit or a milk bottle and has a maximum health of up to 16 points. When the player's score reaches 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and 200,000 points, Higgins will receive an extra life. Finding a bee- like fairy known as Honey Girl will grant Higgins invincibility for about ten seconds and allow him to kill enemies with a single touch. Also hidden in each stage is a special pot, which doubles the player's end-of-stage bonus. Higgins starts off each life without the ability to attack and can only gain the ability to attack by picking up a stone axe, which can be found in specific spots in each stage. When Higgins is wielding the stone axe, he can trade it for magical fireballs that have longer range and are capable of destroying rocks and rolling stones (which are invulnerable to the stone axe). To break an egg, the player must touch it or hit it with a weapon twice. In addition to weapons, there are numerous bonus items inside. There is also the possibility of receiving a negative item, the eggplant, which drains Higgins' life meter. Some of the eggs are not immediately visible in plain sight. The locations of these \\"hidden eggs\\" are usually indicated when a weapon thrown by a player disappears before falling to the ground and are uncovered by jumping at the indicated spot. Some of these hidden spots do not contain hidden eggs, but instead a cloud that will warp the player to a bonus stage, which is instead uncovered by standing still for a short period of time. During bonus stages, the player can collect a series of fruits (each worth 500 points regardless of the type) until Higgins falls into a pitfall. However, instead of losing a life, he will return to the regular stage at the next checkpoint. At the fourth round of each area, Higgins will confront a different form of the Evil Witch Doctor, the game's boss character. He has the ability to change his head by up to eight different types. Higgins must defeat him by striking his head a specific number of times with his weapon. The number of hits required to defeat him increases with each area (his first form requires eight hits and every subsequent form requires two additional hits until the eighth and final form, which requires 22 hits). When the Evil Witch Doctor is defeated, he will change his head and escape to the next area. He uses the same attack in each form, with the only changes being his durability, speed and the speed of his fireball attacks. When Higgins defeats his final form, the Evil Witch Doctor will fall into a pit and the girl will be rescued. Development =Relation to Wonder Boy= Adventure Island began development as a direct port of the Sega arcade game Wonder Boy, the partial rights to which Hudson Soft obtained from developer Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). However, the developer had already signed away ownership of the Wonder Boy name and characters to Sega, so Hudson created a new protagonist modeled and named after Hudson Soft's spokesman Takahashi Meijin. In the western version of Adventure Island, the Takahashi Meijin character was renamed Master Higgins. While the Wonder Boy series adopted an action RPG system for its sequels (beginning with Wonder Boy in Monster Land), most of the Adventure Island sequels stuck to the game system of the original Wonder Boy. Moreover, Hudson Soft also obtained the rights to port all of the Wonder Boy sequels to the TurboGrafx-16, changing the title and character designs of each game (with the exception of Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair). Incidentally, the Japanese version of Dragon's Curse (the TurboGrafx-16 adaptation of Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap) was titled Adventure Island. The rights to the Adventure Island series are currently owned by Konami, who absorbed Hudson Soft in 2012. =Re- releases= The NES version of Adventure Island was re-released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance as a Famicom Mini title on May 21, 2004. It was later re- released internationally for the Virtual Console service in 2008 for the Wii and in 2014 for the Wii U. A remake was also developed for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube titled Hudson Selection Volume 4: Takahashi Meijin no B≈çken Jima, which was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 2003. =Sequels= Two sequels were produced for the NES, Adventure Island II and Adventure Island 3, as well as a fourth game for the Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan titled Takahashi Meijin no B≈çken Jima IV. In addition to the standalone Famicom Mini re-release of the first game, all four games were re-released in a compilation for the Game Boy Advance titled Hudson Best Collection Vol 6: B≈çken Jima Collection, released in Japan on January 19, 2006. Sequels were also released on other platforms, such as Adventure Island and Adventure Island II for the Game Boy (based on the second and third NES games respectively), Super Adventure Island and Super Adventure Island II for the Super NES, New Adventure Island for the TurboGrafx-16, Adventure Island: The Beginning for the Wii, Gacha wa shi Meijin no B≈çken Jima in 2007 for mobile, and Adventure Island Quest by Takahashi Meijin in 2010 for mobile. =Appearances in other games= Takahashi Meijin appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game DreamMix TV World Fighters, released in Japan for GameCube on December 13, 2003. Takahashi Meijin also appears in the sport mobile game Gachapin & Mukku no Dai Undoukai (\\"Gachapin & Mukku's Big Sports Day\\") in 2008, and crosses over with Katamari franchise in the mobile game Takahashi Meijin and Katamari Damacy in 2010.  Other media  = Manga = is a manga based on Hudson Soft's character Bee and Takahashi Meijin, was released in April 1986 to February 1988 in Japan, was published by CoroCoro Comics, and created by Kazuyoshi Kawai. = Anime = Adventure Island also inspired an animated television series titled , which was produced by TMS Entertainment and aired in Japan from October 3, 1986, to September 25, 1987, lasting 51 episodes and a theatrical film. The series also inspired its own Famicom game titled , released on June 5, 1987. The TV series featured Honey Girl (the bee-like fairy who grants Higgins temporary invincibility in the original game) as a major character. The plot involved the kidnapping of Takahashi (Master Higgins) and his lady friend. Honey Girl's mission is to rescue him by enlisting the help of One-Up, Dal, and Midori, three Earth children who also happen to be video game aces. The series featured Minoru Maeda (known for his contributions to the anime versions of Dragon Ball) as character designer, and featured storylines incorporating elements of various popular video games of the day. Another Hudson character, Bomberman, makes a cameo in the second episode. Reception Adventure Island has received positive to mixed reviews from critics. GameSpot awarded the game 6.5 out of 10, calling it a \\"fast-paced, challenging platformer\\". GamesRadar+ ranked it the 23rd best NES game ever made. The staff praised it for the fact that its challenge comes from quality level design and not low quality.

Sumimoto was one of the few sons of Hosokawa Yoshiharu and an adopted son of Hosokawa Masamoto, who was the Kanrei of the Ashikaga shogunate. His roots was the Hosokawa clan at Awa Province. His childhood name was Rokuro (ÂÖ≠ÈÉé). Masamoto did not have his own child and originally had decided to let Hosokawa Sumiyuki, who was from Kujy≈ç clan, succeed the house. However, he changed his mind later and decided to let Sumimoto, who was adopted after Sumiyuki, succeed the house. This naturally caused a rift between Sumimoto and Sumiyuki. In 1507, Masamoto was killed by an adherent of Sumiyuki. Sumimoto was attacked by a retainer of Sumiyuki, Kozai Motonaga, and escaped to Koga, ≈åmi Province, taking refuge at Rokkaku Takayori. Following this, a powerful vassal under the Hosokawa, known as Miyoshi Yukinaga (Nagateru), raised troops in Settsu and destroyed Sumiyuki in the young Sumimoto's name. After repulsing Sumiyuki, Sumimoto succeeded the house in proper form. He and Hosokawa Takakuni, who was from a branch of Hosokawa clan and also another foster son of Masamoto, supported Ashikaga Yoshizumi, who was backed up to the 11th sh≈çgun by Masamoto. In 1493, Masamoto had deposed the 10th Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshiki (Yoshitane), who later escaped from confinement and fled to eastern countries, looking for a chance to regain his position. In 1508, ≈åuchi Yoshioki, who then harbored Yoshiki, marched his armies into Kyoto and returned Yoshiki back to the seat of Sh≈çgun. The relationship between Sumimoto and Takakuni was no longer in harmony, and while Takakuni acted in concert with Yoshioki, Sumimoto was exiled to ≈åmi Province. Sumimoto intended to battle Yoshioki in the province of Settsu, but ended up fleeing to Awa after seeing the superior numbers of Yoshioki's army. In 1511, Sumitomo returned to Kyoto but was defeated by Takakuni and the ≈åuchi at Funaokayama and fled once more. The death of Yoshizumi was another shock to the camp of Sumimoto. ≈åuchi Yoshioki left the capital in 1518 to maintain his own dominion, and regarding this as a chance, Sumimoto attempted another movement on Kyoto in the next year, cooperating with Miyoshi Yukinaga. However, Yukinaga was attacked and defeated by Hosokawa Takakuni and the clan of Rokkaku, who were then at the side of Ashikaga Yoshiki. Yukinaga was caught and forced to die by seppuku. Sumimoto was ill and had not advanced to Kyoto. After Yukinaga's defeat, he escaped again to his home province of Awa and died soon afterward.

The skating technical advisor for the film was original Z-Boy Stacy Peralta. Among the skateboarders who appear in the film as stunt skaters are Mike McGill, \\"Gator\\" Mark Rogowski, Rodney Mullen, Rich Dunlop, Eric Dressen, Lance Mountain, Mike Vallely, Chris Black, Ted Ehr, Natas Kaupas, Chris Borst, and Steve Saiz. Tony Hawk (Buddy) and Tommy Guerrero (Sam), then members of the Bones Brigade, appear in the film as members of Brian's skate crew. Future lead singer of The Aquabats and creator of Yo Gabba Gabba!, Christian Jacobs, also appears in the film as Gremic. The film received a moderate release in the United States from 20th Century Fox (in 469 theaters). Although the film had a relatively low box office turnout, it garnered a significant cult following after its theatrical release, through basic cable replays on networks such as USA and the burgeoning VHS (and later DVD) market, as well as among skateboarders. The title of the film refers to the cryptic question \\"Have you ever gleemed [sic] inside a cube?\\" that Garry Scott Davis (GSD) asked Neil Blender in an interview in the December 1983 issue of Thrasher magazine. In the film, Christian Slater's character defines \\"gleaming the cube\\" as \\"pushing your limits to the edge\\". The DVD contains an easter egg; by highlighting the skateboard on the main menu, viewers can watch a short featurette entitled \\"What Does Gleaming the Cube Mean?\\". Plot Brian Kelly is an underachieving high school student in Orange County, California. An avid skateboarder, Brian is frequently at odds with his parents for his increasingly reckless behavior, which has landed him in jail on more than one occasion. The only person in the family Brian can relate to is his adopted Vietnamese brother Vinh, who works as a shipping clerk for the Vietnamese Anti-Communist Relief Fund (VACRF), an organization which sends medical supplies to Vietnam. When Vinh discovers a suspicious inaccuracy in VACRF's shipping records, he brings it to his boss Colonel Trac, who dismisses the matter as a clerical error, then fires Vinh when he tries to investigate. Undeterred, Vinh sneaks into Westpac Medical Supplies, the warehouse handling VACRF's shipping, but is apprehended by owner Ed Lawndale. Vinh is interrogated by Lawndale and Bobby Nguyen, another of Colonel Trac's employees, at a motel. When Colonel Trac arrives, it is revealed that he and Lawndale are conspirators in a scheme to smuggle illegal weapons to Vietnam. Convinced that Vinh poses no threat to their operation, Trac intends to set him free, but Vinh is strangled to death by Nguyen. They hang Vinh's body from a noose, so the police deem it a suicide. After the funeral, Brian finds the list of medical supplies Vinh was investigating, written in Vietnamese. Looking for someone to translate it, he encounters Bobby Nguyen who starts to follow him. Brian sneaks into the backseat of Nguyen‚Äôs car and witnesses a meeting with Trac and Lawndale, in which Nguyen demands $50,000 and a ticket to Bangkok, but a struggle ensues and Lawndale kills Nguyen. Brian flees to notify the police, but they find no trace of the crime and later learn that Nguyen supposedly arrived in Thailand. Brian tries to convince Detective Al Lucero that his brother did not commit suicide. While skeptical, Lucero offers to look into it. As Brian's suspicion of Colonel Trac grows, he reaches out to Trac's daughter Tina, a fellow high school student and Vinh's ex-girlfriend. After an image makeover, Brian asks her out on a date and the two become closer. He attends one of VACRF's social functions, where he notices Lawndale and learns of his connection to Trac and Westpac. Following in his brother's footsteps, Brian sneaks into Lawndale's warehouse and uncovers a shipping crate full of weapons. Brian causes an explosion at the warehouse and plants evidence to incriminate Trac, but Lucero immediately suspects Brian and admonishes him for the act. However, the incident causes Trac to panic and send his wife and daughter away to his brother's house. A distressed Tina spends the night with Brian instead and discovers a lighter belonging to her father in Brian's room, leading Brian to explain all his suspicions to her. Tina angrily confronts her father about the conspiracy, who is shamed by his involvement and contacts Lawndale to end the operation. In response, Lawndale sends a group of Vietnamese motorcyclists to run Brian down on the street. The police manage to apprehend the bikers and, with the aid of an interpreter, Lucero is able to confirm Lawndale's role in the attack. Brian visits his friend Yabbo, who builds a newer, faster skateboard for Brian and rallies the rest of the skateboarding clique. Brian and the police both converge upon Colonel Trac's house, where Lawndale holds Tina at gunpoint. When Trac tries to wrestle the gun away, Brian crashes into the room through the window, but Lawndale shoots and kills Trac then escapes in a police car. Brian, Lucero, and the entire skateboarding crew eventually corner Lawndale. As Lawndale prepares to shoot Brian, he soars into the air on his skateboard and knocks Lawndale out. Brian comforts Tina about her father's death and suggests that they return to school together, implying that their relationship will continue. Afterwards, Brian and Lucero visit Vinh's grave before driving away.

Born in Belfast, he started his career at Manchester United before playing more than 150 games for Norwich City and was a Northern Ireland international. After his retirement from football in 2008 Mulryne began studying for the Roman Catholic priesthood. He was ordained as a deacon in October 2016 and then as a priest on 8 July 2017. Football career Mulryne began his career as a youth team player at Manchester United in 1994. He was in the FA Youth Cup winning team of 1995, and became a Northern Ireland international even before he made his first team debut. His full international debut came in February 1997 against Belgium but Mulryne had to wait until the following October to make his debut for United against Ipswich in the League Cup (a 2‚Äì0 defeat). Despite being capable as a striker, midfielder or right winger, these positions were virtually monopolised by accomplished players such as David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Andy Cole and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and so Mulryne only managed a handful of first-team games in five seasons at Old Trafford. His only league appearance for United came on the last day of the 1997‚Äì98 season, in which he played the full 90 minutes against Barnsley. Mulryne joined Norwich City for ¬£500,000 on 25 March 1999 in the hope of gaining more first-team opportunities. Mulryne made a promising start to his Norwich career, scoring an excellent free-kick in a televised 1‚Äì0 win at Grimsby Town in Division One which was just his second appearance for Norwich. However, a broken leg sustained in a tackle with Blackburn Rovers' Christian Dailly shortly after the start of the following season ruled him out for most of the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign. In the 2001‚Äì02 season, Mulryne was a member of the Norwich team that reached the final of the Division One play- offs. The match ended 1‚Äì1 after extra time and Mulryne missed one of the spot- kicks in the subsequent shoot-out as Birmingham City won 4‚Äì2 on penalties. Mulryne had missed another penalty earlier that season in a league match against Gillingham at Carrow Road, however Norwich won that game 2‚Äì1. Mulryne's contract was expiring that summer and there was speculation regarding his future until he signed a new three-year contract with Norwich. He was part of the Norwich side that won promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in 2004, but they stayed there for only one season before being relegated. Mulryne then departed from Carrow Road, cancelling his contract by mutual agreement shortly before it expired. He signed for Cardiff City two months later. On 30 August 2005, Mulryne was ejected from Northern Ireland's squad by manager Lawrie Sanchez for a breach of discipline.Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats: Phil Mulryne He had made 27 appearances for the team, a highlight being a headed equaliser against Denmark in 2001. At the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Mulryne was released from his contract at Ninian Park having made only a handful of substitute appearances, and was not until January 2007 before he found a new club after spells having trials with amongst others, Ipswich Town, Brighton & Hove Albion, Polish champions Legia Warsaw and Barnsley.Flown From the Nest ‚Äì Phil Mulryne, ex-canaries.co.uk; accessed 19 September 2015. Manager Martin Ling signed Mulryne for Leyton Orient on 23 January 2007 on a free transfer after impressing on a trial. He made his debut against Brighton & Hove Albion in a 4‚Äì1 home defeat on 13 February after 16 months without first team action. He was released at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, having helped Orient avoid relegation which had looked almost certain for much of the campaign.O's boss begins summer clearout He subsequently had a trial at Bournemouth and played in a friendly against Southampton and then came a trial with St Mirren in Scotland. On 25 October 2007 Mulryne joined King's Lynn FC on a non-contract basis.King's Lynn Football Club ‚Äì Official Website He was released by the club on 1 January 2008. It was announced on 14 March that Mulryne was training with Cliftonville. Ordained ministry In 2009, at the age of 31, Mulryne began formation for the Roman Catholic priesthood. It is understood he was invited to enter the priesthood by Monsignor Noel Treanor, the Bishop of Down and Connor. He had originally intended to become a secular priest and so entered Saint Malachy's Seminary, Belfast, the seminary of the Diocese of Down and Connor. During this time, he studied philosophy for two years at Queen's University Belfast. He then moved to the Pontifical Irish College in Rome and studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Having felt a call to a religious life during his studies, Mulryne entered the novitiate of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) in 2012. On 11 September 2016, he made his profession to become a Dominican friar at St Saviour's Priory in Dublin. On 29 October 2016, he was ordained a deacon by Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin. On 8 July 2017 he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia OP at St Saviour's Priory. He presided at his first Mass on 10 July 2017 at St Oliver Plunkett Church, Belfast.

The floor at the forward section of the vehicle is low to allow for easy entry and egress. Seen here in Sherbrooke, Quebec, the Nova Bus LFS is a common North American model. It has a bicycle rack over the front bumper. Interior of a wheelchair-accessible transit bus, with bucket seats and smart-card readers at the exit. In some cities, such as in Singapore, double-decker buses are used, which have more seating capacity than a single-decker bus of equivalent length. A transit bus (also big bus, commuter bus, city bus, town bus, urban bus, stage bus, public bus or simply bus) is a type of bus used on shorter-distance public transport bus services. Several configurations are used, including low-floor buses, high-floor buses, double-decker buses, articulated buses and midibuses. These are distinct from all-seated coaches used for longer distance journeys and smaller minibuses, for more flexible services. Specifications Generally, a transit bus will have: * large and sometimes multiple doors for ease of boarding and exiting * minimal or no luggage space * bench or bucket seats, with no coachlike head-rests * destination blinds / displays such as headsigns or rollsigns or electronic dot matrix/LED signs * legal standing-passenger capacity * fare taking/verification equipment * pull cord or bus stop request button Modern transit buses are also increasingly being equipped with passenger information systems, multimedia, WiFi, USB charging points, entertainment/advertising, and passenger comforts such as heating and air- conditioning (as opposed to historically where actually necessary). Some industry members and commentators promote the idea of making the interior of a transit bus as inviting as a private car, recognising the chief competitor to the transit bus in most markets. Operations As they are used in a public transport role, transit buses can be operated by publicly run transit authorities or municipal bus companies, as well as private transport companies on a public contract or fully independent basis. Due to the local authority use, transit buses are often built to a third-party specification put to the manufacturer by the authority. Early examples of such specification include the Greater Manchester Leyland Atlantean, and DMS-class London Daimler Fleetline. New transit buses may be purchased each time a route/area is contracted, such as in the London Buses tendering system. The operating area of a transit bus may also be defined as a geographic metropolitan area, with the buses used outside of this area being more varied with buses purchased with other factors in mind. Some regional-size operators for capital cost reasons may use transit buses interchangeably on short urban routes as well as longer rural routes, sometimes up to 2 or 3 hours. Often transit bus operators have a selection of 'dual-purpose' fitted buses, that is standard transit buses fitted with coach-type seating, for longer-distance routes. Sometimes transit buses may also be used as express buses on a limited-stopping or non- stop service at peak times, but over the same distance as the regular route. =Fare payment= Fare payment is done via Smartrider card for Transperth * Smart card * single or multi-ride coupon/ticket * cash * (none required: Zero- fare bus) and is done upon * Pre-payment, done at ticket machines located at the bus stops or at other locations, before getting on the bus. * boarding * departing * both, e.g., after crossing fare zone boundaries * in transit, via an attendant or bus conductor (mostly obsolete systems) =Doors= Depending on payment systems in different municipalities, there are widely different rules with regard to which door, front or rear, one must use when boarding/exiting. For rear doors, most buses have doors opened by the driver controls or patron (with touch-to-open, motion sensor or push bars). Most doors on buses use air-assist technology, the driver controlled doors, use air pressure to force them open, patron-operated doors, can push them open, however, the doors are heavy, so the touch-to-open or push bar mechanism, sends pressurized air to open the doors. Most doors will signify that they are unlocked and open with lights, this gives guide to those who are going up or down the door steps to not trip and fall. Unlocked or open doors, will trigger a brake locking mechanism on the bus to prevent it from moving while someone could possibly be entering or exiting the bus, when the door is closed, the lock will release, this is mostly implemented on rear doors, not really on front doors, since the driver will be paying attention to the front door. Types Transit buses can be single-decker, double-decker, rigid or articulated. Selection of type has traditionally been made on a regional as well as operational basis; however, with the advent of global manufacturing, all of these types can be seen in the same location or country. Depending on local policies, transit buses will also usually have two, three or (for articulated) four doors to facilitate rapid boarding and alighting. In cases of low-demand routes, or to navigate small local streets, some models of minibus and small midibuses have also been used as transit type buses. The development of the midibus has also given many operators a low-cost way of operating a transit bus service, with some midibuses such as the Plaxton SPD Super Pointer Dart resembling full size transit type vehicles. Developments Electric buses are becoming common in some places. Pictured is an example from Toronto. Due to their public transport role, transit buses were the first type of bus to benefit from low-floor technology, in response to a demand for equal access public service provision. Transit buses are also now subject to various disability discrimination acts in several jurisdictions which dictate various design features also applied to other vehicles in some cases. Due to the high number of high-profile urban operations, transit buses are at the forefront of bus electrification, with hybrid electric bus, all- electric bus and fuel cell bus development and testing aimed at reducing fuel usage, shift to green electricity and decreasing environmental impact. Developments of the transit bus towards higher capacity bus transport include tram-like vehicles such as guided buses, longer bi-articulated buses and tram- like buses such as the Wright StreetCar, often as part of bus rapid transit schemes. Fare collection is also seeing a shift to off-bus payment, with either the driver or an inspector verifying fare payments. Commuter bus service A commuter or express bus service is a fixed-route bus characterized by service predominantly in one direction during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets and routes of extended length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs. Commuter bus service also may include other service, characterized by a limited route structure, limited stops and a coordinated relationship with another mode of transportation. They may closely follow the routing of a conventional bus route but not stopping at every stop or not making detours such as into residential or commercial areas that conventional routes may take.

By July of that year she had begun training and wrestling in their primary developmental territory OVW, using simply \\"Shelly\\" as a ring name. Her first role there had her, along with Beth Phoenix, acting as co- manager for Aaron Stevens. As part of her affiliation with Phoenix and Stevens, Shelly had an erotic gimmick, with a relationship between all three being implied. She was involved in a scripted rivalry with Alexis Laree, with Shelly and Phoenix attacking her on several occasions and the pair wrestled her in handicap matches. In her first singles match in OVW Shelly defeated Laree on October 29.

In February 2006, Shelly began a gimmick of being obsessed with Paul Burchill, who was using a pirate gimmick on SmackDown!. It began at the television tapings on February 1, when Burchill had picked her up to perform a piledriver, but instead carried her backstage after looking at her panties. This obsession provoked a feud with Phoenix, when Shelly attacked Phoenix who was attempting to stop Shelly from attacking Cherry during a match between Burchill and Deuce Shade. As part of the feud, Shelly and Phoenix competed against each other in several matches, including a street fight at the television tapings on April 19.

Instead, Ariel and Thorn began appearing in vignettes together, and on July 25, Thorn made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet. Ariel then increased her ringside presence during Thorn's matches, often interfering in his matches, and Thorn began a scripted feud with Balls Mahoney. In order to counteract Ariel's interference, Mahoney began bringing in Francine as an equalizer. Ariel made her ECW in-ring debut against Francine on September 26 in an \\"Extreme Catfight\\", which ended as a no contest due to interference from both Thorn and Mahoney. The two teams feuded until early October, until Francine was released by WWE. During a match between Thorn and CM Punk, Kelly Kelly interfered in order to help Punk. As a result, Punk won the match, and Ariel and Thorn attacked Kelly after the match.

Kira was killed and decapitated. After ≈åishi dispatched Terasaka Kichiemon to inform Asano's widow Y≈çzeiin of the deed, he and the remaining 45 r≈çnin went to Sengaku-ji in Shinagawa where Naganori was buried and there they were arrested. He and the other r≈çnin were ordered to commit seppuku. Since it was an honorable sentence rather than merely decapitation, everyone accepted this sentence as an honor. Legacy After death, Oishi became famous as the example of ideal samurai behavior. His ultimate goal of reestablishment of the Ak≈ç Asano clan was realized as the Tokugawa shogunate did restore some lands (about 1/10 of the original holdings) to the Asano clan.

Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. Stall strips are used to initiate flow separation at chosen locations on the wing during high-angle of attack flight, so as to improve the controllability of the aircraft when it enters stall. They are typically employed in pairs, symmetrically on both wings. On aircraft where wing airflow is affected by asymmetrical propeller wash, a strip may be used on a single wing to reduce risk of entering a spin. Operation CL-215 features a stall strip on the right wing only, ensuring both wings stall at the same angle of attack despite the propeller wash. A stall strip alters the wing‚Äôs stall characteristics and ensures that the wing root stalls before the wing tips. This is usually as a result of initial aircraft flight testing which shows that the existing stall characteristics are unacceptable for certification. In some cases, such as the American Aviation AA-1 Yankee, stall strips are planned to be used on the wing from the start. In the case of the AA-1 the left and right wings were identical, interchangeable and built on a single wing jig, thus the more traditional use of washout in the wing design was not possible. Stall strips typically consist of a small piece of material, usually aluminium, triangular in cross section and often 6-12 inches (15‚Äì30 cm) in length. It is riveted or bonded on the point of the wing‚Äôs leading edge, usually at the wing root. At high angles of attack, it trips the still-laminar boundary layer, initiating flow separation earlier than at other positions along the wing. This has the effect of causing the wing root to stall before the outer portions of the wing, ensuring a progressive outward stall, minimizing the risk of spinning and giving maximum aileron control throughout the stall. They are usually factory-installed or, on rarer occasion, an after- market modification.

Robot welding is the use of mechanized programmable tools (robots), which completely automate a welding process by both performing the weld and handling the part. Processes such as gas metal arc welding, while often automated, are not necessarily equivalent to robot welding, since a human operator sometimes prepares the materials to be welded. Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry. Robot welding is a relatively new application of robotics, even though robots were first introduced into US industry during the 1960s. The use of robots in welding did not take off until the 1980s, when the automotive industry began using robots extensively for spot welding. Since then, both the number of robots used in industry and the number of their applications has grown greatly. In 2005, more than 120,000 robots were in use in North American industry, about half of them for welding.Cary, Howard B. and Scott C. Helzer (2005). Modern Welding Technology. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education. Page 316. . Growth is primarily limited by high equipment costs, and the resulting restriction to high-production applications. Robot arc welding has begun growing quickly just recently, and already it commands about 20% of industrial robot applications. The major components of arc welding robots are the manipulator or the mechanical unit and the controller, which acts as the robot's \\"brain\\". The manipulator is what makes the robot move, and the design of these systems can be categorized into several common types, such as SCARA and cartesian coordinate robot, which use different coordinate systems to direct the arms of the machine. The robot may weld a pre-programmed position, be guided by machine vision, or by a combination of the two methods. pages 60-62 However, the many benefits of robotic welding have proven to make it a technology that helps many original equipment manufacturers increase accuracy, repeat-ability, and throughput The technology of signature image processing has been developed since the late 1990s for analyzing electrical data in real time collected from automated, robotic welding, thus enabling the optimization of welds.

Historically, or in a more general context, the term may refer to a family of old lineage and distinction. Perhaps the most famous Master of Ceremonies in history was Kira Yoshinaka aka , the real-life model of the villain avenged in the tale of the forty-seven r≈çnin of Ak≈ç. Overview The office of k≈çke is typically translated \\"Master of Ceremonies\\" or \\"Master of Court Ceremony\\". The men who k≈çke position performed such roles as that of the courier carrying the sh≈çguns messages to the Imperial court in Kyoto, or one of a reception committee for hosting the Imperial Envoys at Edo. They also represented the shogun in certain functions held at Nikk≈ç and other shrines or temples, and regulated courtly ceremonies and rites observed in the Edo Castle. The office was instituted in 1608, when the Tokugawa shogunate selected certain ancient great dispossessed families to fill the hereditary office. Most of these families claimed descent from shugo (governors) of the Kamakura period to Sengoku period, among them the Takeda, the Imagawa, the Ky≈çgoku, the Rokkaku, the ≈åtomo, the Toki, the Isshiki and the Hatakeyama (a full list is given below). Some families were less prestigious, like the Yokose, the Yura, the ≈åsawa, and the Kira. By the end of the shogunate in the mid-19th century, the occupancy of the office numbered 26. Some families had several branches among the k≈çke, like the Takeda who had two lateral branches with that title. The k≈çke families had land income assessed at less than ten thousand koku which ranked them below a daimy≈ç lord, but were higher ranked than the run-of-the- mill hatamoto (Tokugawa bannermen). Unlike the ordinary hatamoto whose duties were military, the k≈çke had certain privileged missions.

It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only four times in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a significant biological community with fauna such as the mountain tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected as part of the Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the danger of falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.  Geological setting  plume of volcanic ash rises off of its summit. Lying at the eastern edge of the Andean cordillera, Sangay was formed by volcanic processes associated with the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate at the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench. It is the southernmost volcano in the Northern Volcanic Zone, a subgroup of Andean volcanoes whose northern limit is Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia. The next active volcano in the chain, Sabancaya, is in Peru, a distant to the south. Sangay lies above a seismogenic tectonic slab located about beneath Sabancaya, reflecting a sharp difference in the thermal character of the subducted oceanic crust, between older rock beneath southern Ecuador and Peru (dated more than 32 million years old), and younger rock under northern Ecuador and Colombia (dated less than 22 million years old). The older southern rock is more thermally stable than the northern crust, and to this is attributed the long break in volcanic activity in the Andes; Sangay occupies a position at the boundary between these two bodies, accounting for its high level of activity.  Geology  Sangay developed in three distinct phases. Its oldest edifice, formed between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago, is evidenced today by a wide scattering of material opening to the east, defined by a crest about high. This first Sangay, pockmarked by secondary ridges, is thought to have been in diameter, with a summit located southeast of the present summit. The curved shape of the remnants of this first structure indicates that it suffered a massive flank collapse, scattering the nearby forest lowlands with debris and causing a large part of its southern caldera wall to slide off the mountain, forming an embayment lower on its slopes. This thick block, the best preserved specimen of Sangay's early construction, consists of sequentially layered breccias, pyroclastic flows, and lahar deposits. Acidic andesites with just under 60% silicon dioxide dominate these flows, but more basic andesites can be found as well. Sangay's second edifice began to form anew after the massive sector collapse that damaged the first, being constructed between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. Remnants of its second structure lie within the southern and eastern parts of the debris from its first collapse; some remnants of the volcano lie to the west and north as well. Sangay's second structure is believed to have had an east-to-west elongated summit, and like its first summit structure, it suffered a catastrophic collapse that created a debris avalanche wide and up to in length. It was likely less voluminous than the volcano's first version, and its summit lay near Sangay's current one. Sangay currently forms an almost perfect glacier-capped cone high, with a 35¬∞ slope and a slight northeast-southwest tilt. Its eastern flank marks the edge of the Amazon Rainforest, and its western flank is a flat plain of volcanic ash, sculpted into steep gorges up to deep by heavy rainfall. It has a west- east trending summit ridge, capped by three active craters and a lava dome. Sangay has been active in its current form for at least 14,000 years, and is still filling out the area left bare by its earlier incarnations, being smaller than either of them. Uniquely, in its 500,000 years of activity, its magma plume has never changed composition or moved a significant distance. Mainly andesitic in composition, Sangay is highly active. The earliest report of a historical eruption was in 1628; ash fell as far away as Riobamba, located northwest of Sangay, and was severe enough to cover pastures and starve local livestock. The volcano erupted again in 1728, remaining essentially continuously active through 1916, with particularly heavy activity in 1738‚Äì1744, 1842‚Äì1843, 1849, 1854‚Äì1859, 1867‚Äì1874, 1872, and 1903. After a brief pause, it erupted again on August 8, 1934, and has not completely quelled ever since, with heavy eruptive periods occurring in 1934‚Äì1937 and 1941‚Äì1942. Eruptions at Sangay exhibit strombolian activity, producing ashfall, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. All known eruptions at the volcano have had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 3. Despite its activity, Sangay is located in a remote, uninhabited region; only a large Plinian eruption could threaten occupied areas to its west. Nonetheless, a flank collapse on its eastern side, possible given the volcano's construction and history, could displace nearby forest and possibly affect settlements. Access to the volcano is difficult, as its current eruptive state constantly peppers the massif with molten rock and other ejecta. For these reasons it is not nearly as well-studied as other, similarly-active volcanoes in the Andes and elsewhere; the first detailed study of the volcano was not published until 1999.  Ecology  Subtropical rainforest in the Sangay National Park Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's isolation has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope. The highest level below the snowline is dominated by lichen and bryophytes. Below this lies a zone of small trees and shrubs which develops into montane forest, principally in western valleys and on well-irrigated eastern slopes, which occurs below . Tree heights develop from near the top to up to below ; below , subtropical rainforest is present, with temperatures between and up to of rainfall. Fauna is similarly distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pud√∫ (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) can all be found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).  Recreation  search parties looking for two Americans who unsuccessfully attempted to climb Sangay in 1962. Sangay can and has been climbed. It was first ascended in 1929 by Robert T. Moore, prior to its current eruption beginning in 1934. However, the volcano's current active state presents dangers to mountaineers in the form of falling ejecta; in 1976, two members of an expedition on the volcano were struck and killed by falling debris. In addition, the volcano is located in a remote region with poor roads and is difficult to access, and periods of heavy rainfall can flood rivers and cause landslides, rendering the mountain routes impassable. Nonetheless, the Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales, which maintains an office near the mountain, facilitate such activities by providing local guides and rooms for rent to visitors. Ascension takes between 7 and 10 days from Quito. Conditions on the volcano are usually very wet and foggy, which may impair visibility significantly during the ascent.

It extends from former Highway 2 in Cornwall, north to Highway 417 east of Casselman. Highway 138 provides access to the Seaway International Bridge, connecting Cornwall with Massena, New York. The highway is in length. Highway 138 was first established in 1967, connecting Highway 2, now Vincent Massey Drive, with Highway 43 in Monkland. By the mid-1970s, the route had been extended north to meet with the newly opened Highway 417\\\\. Since then it has remained unchanged.  Route description  St. Andrews West Highway 138 is a highway that crosses the Laurentian Valley in eastern Ontario, connecting Highway 401 in Cornwall with Highway 417 east of Casselman. The route begins at 9th Street West, which was Highway 2 until the late 90s, and proceeds north along the western side of Cornwall; this section is maintained under a Connecting Link agreement and is locally known as Brookdale Avenue. After crossing Highway 401, at which there is an interchange, the route encounters Cornwall Centre Road, onto which it turns east. After following it for a brief distance, the highway turns north onto St. Andrews Road; the Connecting Link agreement ends at this junction. Over the next two kilometres (1.25 mi), the highway exits the fringes of Cornwall, passing through the neighbourhood of Churchill Heights. After passing Headline Road (County Road 44), the route divides a forest and then enters an agricultural area before coming upon the community of St. Andrews West. It crosses the Raisin River and continues north through a mix of farmland and forests. Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 138 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 11,200 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Cornwall Centre Road and Kings Road in Saint Andrews while 5,200 vehicles did so each day along the section between Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Roads 43 and 22, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.  History  Highway 138 was established by the Department of Highways on May 1, 1967, following existing Stormont County roads between Highway 2 at the Seaway International Bridge and Highway 43. With the construction of Highway 417 planned and progressing eastward from Ottawa, Highway 138 was extended north to its present terminus east of Casselman in 1971 or 1972. Budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What? committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae. It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer serve long- distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network. On January 1, 1998, of Highway 138 was transferred to the City of Cornwall. This section is now known as Brookdale Avenue.

Broadly speaking, the three main positions are guard, forward and center, with the standard team featuring two guards, two forwards, and a center. Over time, as more specialized roles developed, each of the guards and forwards came to be differentiated, and today each of the five positions are known by unique names, each of which has also been assigned a number: point guard (PG) or 1, the shooting guard (SG) or 2, the small forward (SF) or 3, the power forward (PF) or 4, and the center (C) or 5. The point guard is the de facto leader of the team on the court. This position requires substantial ball-handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The shooting guard, as the name implies, is often the best shooter, as well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer distances. The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball. The small forward is also known to make cuts to the basket in efforts to get open for shots. The power forward and the center make up the frontcourt, often acting as their team's primary rebounders or shot blockers, or receiving passes to take inside shots. The center is typically the larger of the two; however, the anthropometric characteristics of professional basketball positions have changed over the past 2 decades (1997-2016).  Overview  Historically, only three positions were recognized (two guards, two forwards, and one center) based on where they played on the court: Guards generally played outside and away from the hoop and forwards played inside and near the baseline, with the center usually positioned in the key. During the 1980s, the team strategy evolved after the three-point shot was added to the game. More specialized roles developed, resulting in the five position designations used today. However, individual team strategy and availability of personnel can alter the positions used by a particular team. For example, the dribble-drive motion offense and the Princeton offense use four interchangeable guards and one center. This set is also known as a \\"four- in and one-out\\" play scheme. Other combinations are also prevalent. Besides the five basic positions, some teams use non-standard or hybrid positions, such as the point forward, a hybrid small forward/point guard; the swingman, a hybrid small forward/shooting guard; the big, a hybrid power forward/center; and the stretch four, a power forward with the shooting range of typical shooting guards. In the early days of the sport, there was a \\"running guard\\" who brought the ball up the court and passed or attacked the basket, like a point or combo guard. There was also a \\"stationary guard\\" who made long shots and hung back on defense before there was the rule of backcourt violations. The Triangle Offense was born on the hardwood courts of the University of Southern California in the 1940s. Phil Jackson had carried out the Triangle Offense to astounding effect during his long basketball career. As the coach for the Chicago Bulls and then for the Los Angeles Lakers, his insistence on running the Triangle paid off with a combined 11 N.B.A. titles. In 2014 Mr. Jackson joined the New York Knicks but the team was reluctant to implement the triangle offense.  Guard  = Point guard = The point guard (PG),^ a b Rose, Lee H. (2016). The Basketball Handbook. Point guards pass the ball on offence and then head down the floor to set up and start the play. On defense, they guard the other point guard or one of the wings. Once they receive the ball they sprint towards the basket if it is open. If not open they stand back and wait till all of their team's layers are down the floor and pass the ball. If open for a shot they will shoot to score a few points depending on where they standing. Human Kinetics. known as the one, is typically the team's best ball handler and passer. They usually are very fast and are good at driving and short-range. Therefore, they often lead their team in assists and are able to create shots for themselves and their teammates. They are quick and are able to hit shots either outside the key but a majority are inside the 3 point line or layups, largely depending on the player's skill level. Point guards are looked upon as the \\"floor general\\" or the \\"coach on the floor.\\" They should study the game and game film to be able to recognize the weaknesses of the defense, and the strengths of their own offense. They are responsible for directing plays, making the position equivalent to that of quarterback in American football, playmaker in association football (soccer), center in ice hockey, or setter in volleyball. Good point guards increase team efficiency and generally have a high number of assists. They are often referred to as dribblers or play-makers. In the NBA, point guards are usually the shortest players on the team and are mostly between and . Point guards are required to do many things in the game of basketball that are very different to the other four positions on the court. While the other 4 positions are mainly focused on putting the ball in the hoop, the point guard must have a different, more team focused mentality. Running a basketball team comes with many great responsibilities. Above all, the point guard must put the team before themself. = Shooting guard = The shooting guard (SG) is also known as the two or the off guard. Along with the small forward, a shooting guard is often referred to as a wing because of its use in common positioning tactics. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are prolific from the three-point range and long mid range. Some key aspects to being a shooting guard is having the ability to patiently and methodically circulate the three point line linear with that of the ball. This allows the ability to correctly get in open space for other positions handling the ball. Just like all positions in basketball, the ability to communicate efficiently with teammates is key. If a player's teammates do not know where/when a player will be open, they won't be able to deliver the ball when an efficient opportunity presents itself. Besides being able to shoot the ball, shooting guards tend to be proficient at being able to move without the ball to create open looks for themselves, often creating their own shots off the dribble. A versatile shooting guard will have good passing skills that allow them to assume point guard responsibilities and function as combo guards. Bigger shooting guards also tend to play as small forwards. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6 feet 0.75 inches (1.85 m) to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m).  Forward  = Small forward= The small forward (SF), also known as the three, is considered to be the most versatile of the main five basketball positions. \\"Though they're not the primary ball handler, small forwards need dribbling skills. Though they're not expected to be great post players, they need to be able to post up. Though they're often not the top scoring option, they need to be able to score.\\" Versatility is key for small forwards because of the nature of their role, which resembles that of a shooting guard more often than that of a power forward. This is why the small forward and shooting guard positions are often interchangeable and referred to as wings. Small forwards have a variety of assets, such as quickness and strength inside. One common thread among all kinds of small forwards is an ability to \\"get to the line\\" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post-up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. As such, accurate foul shooting is a common skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Besides being able to drive to the basket, they are also good shooters from long range. They are the second-best 3 point shooters on the court along with the shooting guard and usually when stationary, sit just inside the 3 point line. Some small forwards have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities as point forwards. Small forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court, typically playing roles such as swing men and defensive specialists. A smaller small forward under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) might play the shooting guard position some of the time and a bigger small forward taller than 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) might play power forward sometimes. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.92 m) to 6 feet 8.25 inches (2.04 m). = Power forward= The power forward (PF), also known as the four, often plays a role similar to that of the center, down in the \\"post\\" or \\"low blocks\\". The power forward is often the team's most powerful and dependent scorer, being able to score close to the basket while also being able to shoot mid-range jump shots from 10 ‚Äì 15 feet from the basket. Some power forwards have become known as stretch fours, since extending their shooting range to three-pointers. On defense, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket and to have the athleticism to guard quick players away from the basket. Most power forwards tend to be more versatile than centers since they can be part of plays and are not always in the low block. A tall power forward over can be a forward-center, playing PF and C. A smaller power forward can play combo forward, playing SF part-time. In the NBA, power forwards usually range from to without shoes.  Center = Center = The center (C), also known as the five or pivot, usually plays near the baseline or close to the basket (the \\"low post\\"). They are usually the tallest players on the floor. The center usually scores \\"down low\\", or \\"in the paint\\" (near the basket, in the key), but some can be good perimeter shooters. They are typically skilled at gathering rebounds, contesting shots and setting screens on players. The center position has been traditionally considered one of the most important positions, if not the most important. The range of players used in the position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller \\"back to the basket\\" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the position with their defensive skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the high post. This has been due to the scarcity of players possessing the combination of great skill, ideal height, and durability. This has been matched by the development of more fast-paced and athletic basketball play, which calls for less traditional center play and a more up-and-down the court play style. They are usually over tall. The presence of a center who can score in the low post (the area closest to the basket) helps create balance within an offense. If it becomes too easy to score from the low post, the center will get double teamed. This creates opportunity for open shots for perimeter players as the center will ‚Äúkick it out‚Äù to an open perimeter or ‚Äúwing‚Äù player. As perimeter players shoot better from long range, this creates easier opportunity for a center to score, since defenses will play out closer to the perimeter shooters.

They undergo a modest change between immature and adult, without going through a pupal stage. The nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of moulting. The Exopterygota are a highly diverse insect superorder, with at least 130,000 living species divided between 15 orders. They include cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, thrips, lice and stick insects, among many other types of insects. They are distinguished from the Endopterygota (or Holometabola) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (meaning literally \\"internal winged forms\\") develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota (\\"external winged forms\\") develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage, though a few have something resembling a pupa (e.g., Aleyrodidae). Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) also have gradual wing development, this being a plesiomorphic trait. These two orders belong to the infraclass Palaeoptera however, which is not included in Neoptera. As opposed to Neoptera, they cannot fold their wings over their back in the horizontal plane, only vertically (as damselflies do) if at all. Systematics ITIS considers any subdivision of the Neoptera beyond the orders invalid, but this is almost universally rejected. More recently, there is increasing debate about how to subdivide the Exopterygota, and the Neoptera in general.

The government had hoped to enlist the efforts of private merchants, to help them open Japan at far less cost to the government than if they had sent official emissaries or military. Lastochkin volunteered for the mission, seeking the profits from either Japanese trade goods or furs from Hokkaid≈ç. His first attempt failed entirely when his ship sank in the Sea of Okhotsk. But he, along with another merchant named Grigory Shelikhov, was granted trade monopoly over the Kuril Islands (a string of islands extending north from Japan to Siberia). The plan was to sail to Uruppu, one of the islands, with an expedition crew and about 40 settlers. They would set up a small colony town near Uruppu, and try to persuade some Ainu to guide them down to Japan. This second expedition failed as well when, after reaching Uruppu in the summer of 1775, the ship sank in a storm. Lastochkin tried yet again, this time bringing a number of extra ships. It was now 1778, and the expedition met with the Lords of Matsumae clan, the Japanese guardians of the northern borders, for the first time. They bestowed gifts upon the samurai lords, and asked to trade. The samurai informed Lastochkin's party that they did not have the authority to make such agreements on behalf of the sh≈çgun, but that they should return the following year. Doing so, Lastochkin's gifts were returned, forbidden to return to Hokkaido, and informed that he should inquire at Nagasaki, on the southern island of Ky≈´sh≈´, and inconveniently far from Russian holdings, if he wished to trade. Latoschkin returned to Uruppu to plan his next move. In 1779, an earthquake caused a massive tsunami, which tossed the Russian ship some distance inland. This finally convinced Latoschkin to give up on seeking trade with Japan. However, despite his failure to 'open' Japan to trade, he was still one of the first, if not the very first, Russian to meet Japanese, in Japan, in any official capacity.

The genre was particularly popular in Turkey in the decades from the 1960s through the 1990s. As with Arabic music itself, its aesthetics have evolved over the decades. Although melodies and rhythms are predominantly Byzantine and Arabic influenced, it also draws ideas from other aspects of Balkan and Middle Eastern music, including baƒülama music and Ottoman forms of oriental music. Arabesque music are mostly in a minor key, typically in the Phrygian mode, and themes tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife and love issues. Description and history A very small percentage of Arabesque is exclusively instrumental. For the great majority of it, a singer lies at the center of the music. Male singers dominated the genre in its early years, but female singers probably predominated during its peak years of popularity. Simultaneously with the influx of female singers, the sound grew more dancey and upbeat. Orhan Gencebay is generally considered the founder of the genre (though he disagrees with the usage of the term). Other well known older singers are M√ºsl√ºm G√ºrses, Ferdi Tayfur and Hakkƒ± Bulut. One of the most prolific and commercially successful is ƒ∞brahim Tatlƒ±ses, who broke all sales records in Turkey in 1978 and continues to turn out popular music to this day. He has maintained popularity in the Arabesk scene in recent years through remixing his tracks into dance-friendly club tracks. The pure Arabesque album ‚ÄúAcƒ±larƒ±n Kadƒ±nƒ±‚Äù (tr: woman of pains) by the singer Bergen was the bestselling album in Turkey in 1986 and may be fairly labelled one of the classic albums of the genre. Bergen had several other hit Arabesque albums during the 1980s. Other singers include Ebru G√ºnde≈ü, Seda Sayan, and Sibel Can. The singers Muazzez Ersoy and B√ºlent Ersoy designate themselves as modern exponents of Ottoman classical music. Zerrin √ñzer also made arabesque albums between 1982 and 1988, including her album named ‚ÄúMutluluklar Dilerim‚Äù released in 1984. One of the important names of arabesque music who died in 2012 was Azer B√ºlb√ºl. A common theme in Arabesque songs is the highly embellished and agonizing depiction of love and yearning, along with unrequited love, grief and pain. This theme had undertones of class differences in early 1960-70s, during which most of the genre's followers ‚Äî mostly working class to lower middle class ‚Äî identified themselves with. Turkish composer Fazƒ±l Say has repeatedly condemned and criticized Arabesque genre, equating the practice of listening to Arabesque ‚Äútantamount to treason‚Äù.

The route connects Highway 417 south of Vankleek Hill with Hawkesbury. It is long, traveling through a mostly rural portion of the lower Ottawa Valley near the Ontario‚ÄìQuebec border. The highway formerly continued south of Highway 417 to Highway 2 in Lancaster. However, this section was decommissioned as a provincial highway and was subsequently redesignated as Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Road 34\\\\.  Route description  Highway 417 exit to Highway 34 Highway 34 is short highway which today serves to connect the town of Hawkesbury with Highway 417\\\\. The route ends at Main Street, near the Ottawa River in downtown Hawkesbury. Between these two points, with the exception of the town of Vankleek Hill, the highway traverses the rural Ottawa Valley, remaining straight in a southwest‚Äìnortheast orientation except through Hawkesbury. The majority of the land use surrounding the highway is composed of commercial shops in urban areas and agricultural in rural areas, though some small woodlots exist alongside the route. Two interchanges exist along the route: at the southern terminus with Highway 417 and with Prescott and Russell County Road 17 (former Highway 17). Like other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 47 was maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 1989, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 5,050 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Highway 417 and Vankleek Hill while 16,400 vehicles did so each day along the section between Prescott and Russell County Road 17 and Hawkesbury, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.  History  Highway 34 has a very tame history, having been assumed in 1930 and remaining unchanged between then and the highway downloads of the late 1990s, with the exception of an interchange with Highway 417 opened in late 1974. On November 26, 1930, the Department of Highways assumed the road between Lancaster and Hawkesbury as King's Highway 34, providing a connection between Highway 2 and Highway 17 immediately west of the Ontario‚ÄìQuebec border. The route was long at the time of its assumption. On November 8, 1974, Highway 417 opened between Prescott and Russell County Road 9 (Highland Road) and the existing Highway 17 near from the Quebec border, with an interchange located at Highway 34. Highway 34 otherwise remained unchanged for over 60 years. However, budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What? committee to determine cost- cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae. It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should, therefore, be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network. It was determined that the portion of Highway 34 south of Highway 417 had largely been supplanted by the nearby Highway 138, and no longer served long-distance traffic movement. As such, the section of Highway 34 within the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry was decommissioned as a provincial highway and transferred to that jurisdiction on January 1, 1998. It has since been redesignated as Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Road 34.

It is located on 11.5 km¬≤ of land north of the Manawatu Gorge in the North Island of New Zealand. At 90.75 MW, it was New Zealand's largest capacity wind farm until September 2007, when the third stage of the nearby Tararua Wind Farm was completed. The $100 million wind farm consists of 55 separate turbines capable of generating 1.65 MW each, representing a total capacity of 90.75 MW. Each turbine is atop a tower. It is fitted with 3 blades each 35 metres in length.\\"Intelligent energy metering\\", Electrical Automation, October/November 2007. Location The site near the Manawatu Gorge area is ideal for wind farms. The Tararua and Ruahine Ranges provide a barrier to the predominantly westerly winds that flow across New Zealand. Between the two ranges lies a lower range of hills that serve to funnel the wind. TrustPower, another New Zealand electricity generator and retailer, operates a wind farm on the south side of the Manawatu Gorge. Carbon offsets The Te Apiti wind farm is also a carbon offset project. In 2005 the British bank HSBC purchased 125,000 tonnes worth of carbon credits from Meridian generated by the wind farm. Meridian Energy also sold the Dutch government 530,000 tonnes of carbon credits from Te Apiti. The price per tonne was considered to be about $10.40 a tonne. In both cases, the carbon credits for Te Apiti were from New Zealand's Assigned amount units allocated under the Kyoto Protocol. The New Zealand Government granted the AAUs to Meridian Energy as an incentive for carbon neutral power development under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme (or PRE). As of 2007, installed capacity of wind turbines in New Zealand has reached 321 MW and a further 46.5 MW is under construction.Wind turbines now provide enough competitively priced and sustainably generated, electricity to meet the needs of 145,000 NZ households Transmission Te Apiti was the first wind farm in New Zealand to connect directly to Transpower's national grid. Previously constructed windfarms, including Hau Nui and Tararua, connected to the national grid via local distribution and sub-transmission lines. Electricity from the 55 turbines is sent via a network of underground cables to the Te Apiti substation near the lookout, where the electricity is stepped-up to 110 kV for transmission. A single-circuit transmission line connects the wind farm to the national grid at Transpower's Woodville substation. Virtual field trip Construction of the Te Apiti wind farm The New Zealand online education programme, LEARNZ, conducted a virtual field trip to Te Apiti Wind Farm in April 2008. Over 1500 New Zealand school students joined LEARNZ teacher Darren on this trip. Telephone conferences were held between students and wind farm staff.

Dramatists Victorien Sardou, Alexandre Dumas, fils, and Emile Augier wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term.Banham (1998), 964, 972‚Äì3, 1191‚Äì2. Henrik Ibsen and the other realistic dramatists of the later 19th century (August Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, √âmile Zola, Anton Chekhov) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre problem play. \\"Through their example\\", Marvin Carlson explains, \\"the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of play construction.\\"Carlson (1993, 216). Eug√®ne Scribe In the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer's Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship (1912),Archer, William. Playmaking: a Manual of Craftsmanship. Public domain. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10865 and in the United States with George Pierce Baker's Dramatic Technique (1919).J L Styan, Modern Drama in Theory and Practice I, quoted by Innes (2000, 7). Form Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure The form has a strong Neoclassical flavour, involving a tight plot and a climax that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of Aristotle's ideal Greek-tragedy model outlined in his Poetics.The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.htmlAristotle. \\"Poetics\\". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014. The well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria. First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or peripeteia. A d√©nouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved. A recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about plot twists and climaxes. The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as quid pro quo.Holmgren, Beth. \\"Acting Out: Qui pro Quo in the Context of Interwar Warsaw.\\" East European Politics & Societies (2012): 0888325412467053. Eugene Scribe contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays. History =French Neoclassicism: a standard form= History of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the French Academy to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of Verisimilitude, or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play. In 1638, the French Academy codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the Le Cid debate. The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies. This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the French Revolution. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Beaumarchais. After the French Revolution, adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity. =Boulevard theatres: new forms= Although Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres. In order to work around the formal monopoly of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form. After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe. Scribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience. Criticism =On Scribe, Dumas fils, Augier, and Sardou= Scribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, \\"cannot be overestimated\\". Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater: \\"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic.\\" Although Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with Alexandre Dumas, fils, adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas fils states,\\"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.\\". Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. Emile Augier also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.Taylor, John Russell. The Rise and Fall of the Well-Made Play, Great Britain: Routledge, Cox and Wyman, Ltd.,1967. Print. By the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor.Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, \\"Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?\\" In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after Victorien Sardou, who also wrote in the well-made style. =Shaw and Ibsen= The opening to the preface to Three Plays by Brieux offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as ‚Äúliterary mechanics‚Äù instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism \\"Art for art's sake,\\" as \\"Success for money's sake.\\"Shaw, George Bernard. ‚Äò‚ÄôThree Plays by Brieux‚Äô‚Äô. New York: Brentano‚Äôs, 1911. In an essay published in PMLA in 1951, Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw‚Äôs Dramatic Theory and Practice, Milton Crane reasons that Shaw‚Äôs disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen‚Äôs work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw‚Äôs theory of the problem play and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen‚Äôs, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula. Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in Pygmalion, Man and Superman, and The Doctor‚Äôs Dilemma.Crane, Milton. \\"Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw's Dramatic Theory and Practice.\\" PMLA 66.6 (1951): 879-85. JSTOR [JSTOR]. Web. 4 May 2015. The problem play Henrik Ibsen as a young man Shaw discusses the notion of the problem play in an essay of the same title published in 1895. He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the \\"Woman question\\" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the \\"Woman question\\" in A Doll's House and Ghosts qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites Hamlet, Faust, and Les Mis√©rables as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play \\"flat as ditchwater\\" once society progresses and the issue is resolved. Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.Innes, Christopher. \\"Henrik Ibsen, Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana, 26 May 1898.\\" A Sourcebook on Naturalist Theatre. London: Routledge, 2000. 74-75. Print. The well-made play and modern drama Ibsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state \\"[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.‚Äù Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion. Offshoots Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain). Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality. Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play. The Wild Duck (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the Scribean formula. Ibsen sought a compromise between Naturalism and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.Elsom, John. Post-War British Theatre. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 40. Although George Bernard Shaw scorned the \\"well-made play\\", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist.Elsom, John. Post-War British Theatre. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 43. Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in Arms and the Man. Also, J. B. Priestley's 1946 An Inspector Calls may in some ways be considered a \\"well- made play\\" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's A Doll's House transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality. He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.Elsom, John. Post-War British Theatre. London: Routledge, 1976, p. 45. The techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often farce. In The Quintessence of Ibsenism, Bernard Shaw proposed that Ibsen converted this formula for use in \\"serious\\" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible d√©nouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the protagonists beyond the last act curtain.Shaw, Bernard. The Quintessence of Ibsenism. New York: Brentano's, 1913. Print.

He started in the grindcore band Terrorizer where he recorded the album World Downfall, the first album to feature Pete Sandoval who would later leave the band to join Morbid Angel. It was Jesse Pintado who coined the term \\"grindcore\\" for the first time (in 1983), to describe a musical mixture of \\"noise and chaos\\" which he was developing at that time. He lived in Huntington Park, California (his home address was even on the booklet of the \\"World Downfall\\" CD for contacting), but moved to Birmingham, England after he joined Napalm Death, where he replaced guitarist Bill Steer immediately prior to the recording of their album Harmony Corruption. In 2004 he officially left Napalm Death; instead of replacing him, the band has since continued as a four-piece. Pintado later revived Terrorizer, recruiting Tony Norman of Monstrosity and Anthony Rezhawk of Resistant Culture; he and Pete Sandoval were the only original members. Besides Terrorizer and Napalm Death he also played in Lock Up and Brujeria (see discography below). Both bands also featured Napalm Death bass player Shane Embury. His last residence was Ridderkerk in the Netherlands, and a few weeks after the release of Terrorizer's second album, he died in a hospital in the Netherlands due to liver failure after a diabetes-induced coma.

Dick, first published in November 1954 in Beyond Fantasy Fiction. Plot summary By offering up the blood of a lamb, Silvia, the protagonist of Upon the Dull Earth, is able to summon creatures she identifies as angels. She thinks that the creatures are her ancestors, and she is sure that one day she will join them. At the same time, though, it is not clear whether the creatures are really good, as Silvia thinks, or wicked. Their behavior and their relation with Silvia scare the girl's relatives and Rick, her boyfriend. Rick thinks that Silvia's behavior is very dangerous, as \\"the white-winged giants ... can sear [her] to ash\\". During a quarrel with Rick, the girl accidentally cuts herself. Independently from her will, Silvia's blood summons the creatures. Unable to control their power, the angel-like giants burn Silvia's body and leave only \\"a brittle burned-out husk\\". Unable to accept his lover's death, Rick tries to bring Silvia back, but in doing so he causes the degeneration and destruction of the world he lives in. The story also develops one of Dick's favorite themes, namely the definition of what is real. The reality we think we know well turns out to be insubstantial, due to Dick's use of multiple possible realities which ends up deconstructing the idea of reality itself. As the short story investigates these questions, first at an epistemological level and then at an ontological one, Upon the Dull Earth unfolds like a conventional horror plot. Rick manages to contact the light- creatures who apparently belong to a higher realm of being and he also manages to speak with Silvia. The girl now lives in the realm of the angel-like creatures, but she wants to come back and she explains that they made a mistake when they took her away. The creatures think that bringing Silvia back could be dangerous. Besides, Silvia explains that in order to come back she needs \\"some shape to enter\\" because there are no \\"material forms\\" in the higher continuum. She would have to take something from the human world, \\"something of clay\\". At the end of the story, Silvia manages to come back, but the effects of her return are disastrous. As soon as she appears in front of Rick, Silvia realizes that something has gone wrong and that she has taken the place of someone else. In fact, she has taken her sister's body. There is a scene in which Rick sees Betty Lou (Silvia's sister) change and become Silvia, but it is just the beginning of the nightmare atmosphere which engulfs the story's ending. In fact, the process of transformation is not over. Slowly, every member of Silvia's family becomes Silvia. Rick runs away in a fright, but his body is destined to be invaded by Silvia, too. The girl has assumed the role of a revenant who invades the body and mind of any living person and spreads like a virus, a curse, leaving no hope for redemption. At the end of the story, after a useless flight, after he has seen service-station attendants, waitresses and common people change into Silvia before his very eyes, Rick looks at himself in a mirror and sees his face slowly becoming Silvia's. Suddenly, the man is gone and only Silvia remains. The girl finds herself alone and does not understand what has happened. Adaptations \\"Upon the Dull Earth\\" was adapted into an audio drama, \\"Silvia's Blood\\", by The Truth.

It was formed by a merger between the aircraft and rocket engine manufacturer and aerospace component manufacturer group SNECMA and the security company SAGEM in 2005. In 2018 Safran took control of Zodiac Aerospace, significantly expanding its aircraft equipment activities. Its headquarters are located in Paris. Employing over 95,000 people and generating 24.64 billion euros in sales in 2019, Safran operates in the aircraft propulsion and equipment, space and defense markets. The company is listed on the Euronext stock exchange and is part of the CAC 40 and Euro Stoxx 50 indices. Name The name Safran was chosen from 4,250 suggestions, including 1,750 proposed by employees. As a holding company for many subsidiaries, the name was deemed suitable for the suggestion of direction, movement, and strategy. Safran translates as rudder blade and as saffron, which the company highlights as one of the catalysts for early international trade. History =Origins= In 1905 Louis Seguin created the company Gnome. Production of the first rotary engine for airplanes, the Gnome Omega, started in 1909. This company merged with the Le Rh√¥ne, a company created in 1912 by Louis Verdet, to form the Gnome et Rh√¥ne engine company. Gnome & Rh√¥ne was nationalized in 1945, creating Snecma. In 2000, this company gave its name to the ‚ÄúSnecma Group‚Äù, and carried out a number of acquisitions to form a larger group with an array of complementary businesses. Sagem (Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôApplications G√©n√©rales de l‚ÄôElectricit√© et de la M√©canique) was created in 1925 by Marcel M√¥me. In 1939, Sagem entered the telephone and transmissions market by taking control of Soci√©t√© anonyme des t√©l√©communications (SAT). It acquired Soci√©t√© de Fabrication d‚ÄôInstruments de Mesure (Sfim), a measurement instrument specialist, in 1999. However, by 2008 Sagem Mobile and Sagem Communications had been sold. Sagem Mobile became Sagem Wireless in January 2009. = Safran Group = The Safran Group was created on May 11, 2005, with the merger of Snecma and Sagem SA. In June 2014, Arianespace CEO Stephane Israel announced that European efforts to remain competitive in response to SpaceX's recent success have begun in earnest. This included the creation of a new joint venture company from Arianespace's two largest shareholders: the launch-vehicle producer Airbus and engine-producer Safran. By May 2015, Safran had created with Airbus Group a launcher joint venture called Airbus Safran Launchers. This entity is currently developing the Ariane 6 launch vehicle for initial flights in the 2020s. In January 2017, Safran initiated a takeover of the aircraft interior supplier Zodiac Aerospace to create the third largest aerospace supplier with $22.5 billion revenue, behind United Technologies with $28.2 billion and GE Aviation with $24.7 billion; the new group will be 92,000-employee strong, with 48% of its business in aircraft systems and equipment, from landing gears to seats, 46% in propulsion and 6% in defense. In May 2017, Safran announced the completion of the sale of its identity and security activities to Advent International for Euro 2.4 billion. In February 2018, Safran took control of Zodiac Aerospace, significantly expanding its aircraft equipment activities. Zodiac Aerospace has 32,500 employees and generated sales of 5.1 billion euros for its fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.

The association has been overseen by the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China since the State Administration for Religious Affairs' absorption into the United Front Work Department in 2018. The association's headquarters are located in Guangji Temple in Beijing. Overview The BCA is charged with serving as a \\"bridge\\" linking Buddhists to the Chinese government by communicating government regulations to Buddhists and mobilizing them to comply with national laws.Congressional-Executive Committee on China, Tibet Special Report 2008-2009 , October 22, 2009 It also encourages participation of Chinese Buddhists in international Buddhist fora and supports local Buddhist associations in paying clerics' salaries, in registering temples with the government, and in productively using temple labor. The association publishes a journal, Chinese Buddhism. History The Buddhist Association of China was founded in 1953, and was disbanded in the late 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, then reactivated following the end of that period. In 1994 Zhao Puchu tried to limit the practice of businesses and municipalities building outlandishly large mountaintop and cliffside Buddha statues. Noting that China has at least one mountaintop Buddha for each of the cardinal directions he stated ‚ÄúThat's enough,‚Äù and clarified. ‚ÄúFrom now on, there is no need to build any more outdoor Buddha statues.‚Äù These efforts were entirely unsuccessful. In 2006, The BCA and the Hong Kong Buddhist Association hosted the second World Buddhist Forum for dialogue between Buddhist monks and scholars from 50 countries and regions. The forum lasted for four days in the city of Wuxi in Jiangsu province. The organizer of events was the president of the BCA, Venerable Master Yi Cheng. The vice president is Gyaincain Norbu, a disputed 11th Panchen Lama. In 2017 the BCA declared the longstanding tradition that the first offerings of the new year are particularly auspicious to have no grounds in Buddhist doctrine. In August 2018 Shi Xuecheng resigned as President of the Buddhist Association of China following reports of sexual harassment by six female monks. The scandal was seen as part of the wider me too movement.

Background The Scots Covenanters had taken the side of the English Parliament during the English Civil War and had fought a bitter Wars of the Three Kingdoms at home against the Scottish Royalists. However, they were excluded from negotiations by the victorious English Parliament and by 1647, they despaired of achieving their political goals - the establishment of Presbyterianism in the Three Kingdoms and asserting the civil authority of the Scots Parliament and the General Assembly of the Scottish Kirk (Presbyterian Church). They even suspected that the Parliamentarians would annex Scotland and impose their own \\"Independent\\" religious settlement. For this reason, one faction of the Covenanters, the Engagers, signed a secret deal with Charles I called the \\"Engagement\\". However, they were defeated in an attempted invasion of England and even came to blows with fellow Covenanters who wanted a more forthright deal with the King. Treaty When Charles I was executed in 1649, the radical Covenanters, or \\"Kirk Party\\", moved to do a new deal with Charles II, the son of the dead King, who was in exile in Breda. The treaty basically granted everything the Kirk Party wanted. Charles II undertook to establish Presbyterianism as the national religion and to recognise the authority of the Kirk's General Assembly in civil law in England as it already was in Scotland. Charles also took the Solemn League and Covenant oath of 1643. Charles was crowned King of Scots in Scone in January 1651, but by then the terms agreed at Breda were already a dead letter. The army associated with the Kirk Party under David Leslie was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar in September 1650 and the English Parliamentarian New Model Army had taken Edinburgh and much of Lowland Scotland. Even a subsequent rapprochement between moderate and radical Covenanters and their former enemies, the Scottish Royalists, was not enough to restore Charles' throne. He fled the country for France after his defeat at the battle of Worcester in September 1651. Under the Commonwealth of England, Scotland was annexed, its legislative institutions abolished and Presbyterianism dis-established. There was freedom of religion under the Commonwealth, except for Roman Catholics, but the edicts of the Kirk's assemblies were no longer enforced by law, as previously. After being restored to his throne in 1660 King Charles completely reneged on the Treaty of Breda, seeking to restore an Episcopalian church structure in Scotland.

As such, it is in practice identical in span to the Holocene. The Flandrian began as the relatively short-lived Younger Dryas climate downturn came to an end. This formed the last gasp of the Devensian glaciation, the final stage of the Pleistocene epoch. The Flandrian is traditionally seen as the latest warm interglacial in a series that has been occurring throughout the Quaternary geological period. The first part of the Flandrian, known as the Younger Atlantic, was a period of fairly rapid sea level rise,Tooley, M. J. (1979) Sea-level Changes: North-West England During the Flandrian Stage Clarendon Press, Oxford, England, known as the Flandrian transgression. It is associated with the melting of the Fenno-Scandian, Scottish, Laurentide and Cordilleran glaciers. Fjords were formed during the Flandrian transgression when U-shaped glaciated valleys were inundated. Milankovitch theory alone would forecast that the present Flandrian climate, like that of other interstadials, should eventually decline in temperature, towards a global climate similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum. Less orbital eccentricity might have the effect of moderating this temperature downturn.sciencemag.org An Exceptionally Long Interglacial Ahead? However, orbital cycles are not the only influence on global temperature; atmospheric greenhouse gasses also affect the radiative forcing. While there is agreement that post-industrial- revolution greenhouse-gas emissions are substantially warming the planet, there is debate over whether early agriculture, beginning thousands of years earlier, has had a much smaller warming effect (due to methane emissions from rice paddies, or deforestation, for instance). If this is the case, the climate of at least the later Holocene has long deviated from what would be expected with only orbital forcings, and the Flandrian has long been an atypical interglacial.

Aside from WWE, Albright is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, having won the title while performing for Ring of Honor. Professional wrestling career =All Pro Wrestling (1998‚Äì2003)= Albright made his professional wrestling debut for All Pro Wrestling (APW) on October 10, 1998, as Vinnie Valentino, in a losing effort against Vinny Massaro.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1160&page;=4&s;=300 He would gain his first win came in his second match in January 1999 when he, Chris Ward, and Tony Jones defeated Jason C. Clay, Nathaniel Sweete, and Rick Turner. Albright continued to wrestler for APW throughout his early years. =World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment= Early appearances (2001‚Äì2003) Albright wrestled three times for the World Wrestling Federation in 2001 and 2002, where he lost to cruiserweights such as Essa Rios. Later in 2003, he wrestled under the name Slater Vain for some of WWE's (formerly WWF) tertiary shows. Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004‚Äì2006) Albright signed a development contract in early 2004 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). During his time with OVW, Albright was both OVW Heavyweight Champion and OVW Television Champion, as well as co-holder of the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship with WWE wrestler Chris Masters. Albright was the first 'Triple Crown' winner in OVW, winning all 3 major titles. Albright was the first OVW 'Beat the Champ' TV champion, which is now simply called the OVW TV title. He defeated Seth Skyfire on January 26, 2005, to win the title. He held that title until April 30, 2005, when he won his first OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Matt Morgan with the Crowbar. Albright vacated the TV title shortly after winning the OVW title. He was also the first person to hold two titles simultaneously in OVW. He held the OVW championship until August 3, when he lost to Johnny Jeter. Shortly after losing the OVW title, Albright began a feud with Ken Doane over the OVW TV title in a feud that started over Doane accusing Albright of disrespecting the belt. In October 2005, in the midst of the feud with Doane, Albright also began feuding with CM Punk when Punk refused to shake Albright's hand after he had pinned him in a match. Punk would assault Albright prior to a TV title match against Doane and take his place, winning the belt when Albright accidentally hit the champion with a chair. He became a frequent challenger to Punk's TV gold, ultimately falling each week when Punk would find a way to weasel out the victory, be it a time-limit or an injury. In December 2005, Albright, Ken Doane and CM Punk competed in the first ever Triple Threat match in Ohio Valley Wrestling for the TV Title. Punk won the match when he made Albright submit to the Anaconda Vice while Albright also had Doane in a Sharpshooter. On January 4, 2006, Albright was in a rematch with Doane and Punk for the title. Doane was forced to leave the match early due to injury and was replaced by Aaron Stevens. Albright seemingly gained his revenge on Punk, eliminating him from the match with the crowbar, only to have Punk return and attack him, leading to Stevens winning the championship. On the January 11, 2006, OVW show, Albright won a chance for a match against Stevens for the TV Title at an upcoming WWE house show in Louisville, Kentucky by actually teaming up with CM Punk in a match against Paul Burchill and Ken Doane. Punk and Albright won the match when Punk made Burchill submit to the Anaconda Vice, but Albright went on to lose the rematch against Stevens. The feud between Punk and Albright took a new turn when the two began teaming together weekly, competing with each other in a game of oneupmanship. Punk challenged Albright to see who could make their opponent submit the quickest in a match with The Highlanders. Albright made Rory submit in less than a minute, only to be attacked by Punk and choked out with the Anaconda Vice. Afterwards, just like many times before, Punk would tell Albright that he had been 'Punk'd'. After saving Punk from a 5 on 1 attack by the Spirit Squad, Albright told Punk that they would never be able to settle their differences as long as the Spirit Squad was around. The next week, Punk and Albright teamed up to take on all 5 members of the Spirit Squad in a match that saw Albright set-up Punk. Albright turned on Punk, giving the impression that being 'Punk'd' for months had finally gotten into his head to the point to where he was obsessed with returning the favor on Punk. Albright introduced a new element to their feud upon his heel turn: his grandfather's thick leather strap, which Albright used to continually whip Punk. On the March 1, 2006 OVW show, CM Punk and Albright met in the finals of a tournament to crown a new OVW Heavyweight Champion (vacated by Matt Cappotelli). Punk suffered a knee injury in the match, and consequently had to be carried out on a stretcher, only to be attacked and whipped by Albright with the strap. Albright dragged Punk back to the ring, and after surviving a comeback by Punk, managed to lock in the STF. Though Punk did not submit, Albright managed to hold the lock in so that Punk would pass out, giving Brent the victory and making him a two- time OVW Heavyweight Champion. The next week, Albright vowed that Punk would never get a title shot at the OVW title unless he shook Albright's hand. A defeated Punk came out, but instead of shaking Albright's hand he hand-cuffed him to the top rope and viciously strapped him with Albright's own leather strap. This led to a strap match between the two on the May 3, 2006 OVW show, where Albright lost the title to Punk. SmackDown! (2006) Albright made his WWE debut on the April 7, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, under the ring name Gunner Scott. In his first match, he managed to defeat Booker T (due to the Boogeyman's music being played and distracting Booker T). Later during the show, Chris Benoit met him backstage and praised him on his winning debut. On the May 19 episode of SmackDown Scott teamed up with Benoit for the first time to take on Booker T and Finlay. Scott won the match, pinning Booker T once again with another distraction in the form of Bobby Lashley. On the June 16 episode, Albright teamed up with Matt Hardy to take on Finlay and William Regal in a losing effort. On June 28, 2006, Albright was sent back down to OVW. His last appearance on the main roster was on the June 30 episode of SmackDown!, in which he faced off against Mr. Kennedy in a losing effort. After the match he was destroyed by The Great Khali and thrown into a body bag. He continued to compete mostly on OVW house shows until he was eventually released from his WWE contract on October 12, 2006. =Pro Wrestling Noah (2003)= Albright toured Pro Wrestling Noah in 2003, where his first win came when he teamed with 2 Cold Scorpio to defeat Bull Schmitt and Donovan Morgan. He participated in a junior heavyweight tag team tournament along with Donovan Morgan and Michael Modest with the trio making the finals before losing to Makoto Hashi, Takashi Sugiura, and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)= When he returned to the USA, he lost to Shark Boy at thirty fourth Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Xplosion. =Ring of Honor (2006‚Äì2009)= Albright made his debut for Ring of Honor on October 27, 2006, in Dayton, Ohio with a loss to Christopher Daniels. In his second outing he participated in a gauntlet match where he defeated both Trik Davis and Jason Blade, after which the crowd chanted \\"Please Come Back\\" and \\"Welcome Home\\". After competing in Ring of Honor for over a month to earn a roster spot, he finally did on November 26, 2006. Shortly after earning a roster spot, he turned heel after attacking Colt Cabana on the orders of Lacey. He became known as \\"The Gun for Hire\\" Brent Albright, willing to take payments to inflict injury on an opponent. At the International Challenge, he received a payment from Bryan Danielson to injure Homicide's shoulder shortly before their ROH World Championship match at Final Battle 2006. He was, alongside B.J. Whitmer and Adam Pearce, a member of ROH's Hangmen 3 stable. In April 2008 \\"Sweet N'Sour\\" Larry Sweeney bought all three men's contracts and merged them into Sweet N'Sour Inc. Whitmer balked and was booted from the group. On May 10, 2008 Albright quit the group himself following a Tag Team Scramble match where he and Chris Hero lost to Delirious and Pelle Primeau. He suplexed every member of the group minus Sweeney who escaped. After not appearing in ROH for nearly six months, Albright returned to the company at the March 5 tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling. =National Wrestling Alliance (2007‚Äì2008)= Brent made the finals of the NWA Reclaiming the Glory tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On September 1, 2007 he lost to \\"Scrap Iron\\" Adam Pearce in the tournament finale in Bayamon, Puerto Rico and began chasing Pearce for the title. On August 2, 2008 in New York City Albright defeated Adam Pearce to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, however Pearce quickly regained the belt on September 20 at the New Alhambra Arena in Philadelphia. Brent Albright also wrestled for NWA Showcase prior to retiring in 2011. He also wrestled for Impact Zone Wrestling in Oklahoma from September 2011 to December 2011.

Moritz. The film stars Adam Scott, Martin Henderson, Ice Cube, Monet Mazur, Jaime Pressly, Will Yun Lee, Jay Hernandez, Matt Schulze, Max Beesley, Fredro Starr and Christina Milian. The film tells the story of large groups of highly skilled motor racers who participate in underground motorcycle races. Torque was theatrically released on January 16, 2004 in the United States. The film under-performed at the box office, grossing $46.5 million worldwide against production budget of $40 million, and received generally negative reviews with common criticisms regarding the performances, writing and direction, though some critics praised the action sequences. It was nominated for several Taurus Awards for its stunts. Plot The film begins with two cars racing in the middle of the desert. Biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) pulls up on his motorcycle and tries to pass them. He finally does so and stops at a diner owned by his ex-girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur). There are pictures all over the wall of Ford and Shane back when they were together. Ford takes one of the pictures. He then goes back outside and the two street racers who didn't let him pass arrive. The three get into a fight but Ford beats up both of them before letting them go. Next Ford meets up with his two best friends Dalton (Jay Hernandez) and Val (Will Yun Lee) and they take a ride back to town to see a motorcycle party. Ford sees Shane and the two begin conversing, with Shane saying that she is mad that Ford left. A biker gang called the Hellions pulls up which consists of Henry James (Matt Schulze) the leader, his girlfriend China (Jamie Pressly) and his right-hand man Luther (Max Beesley) . Henry is pissed at Ford for stealing his bikes (which contain drugs) while Ford reasons by saying that he stole the bikes to pay off bills. The Hellions leave and Ford, Dalton and Val all take a ride on their bikes. Another biker gang friends with the Hellions pull up. The black biker gang called the Reapers, consisting of Trey (Ice Cube) the leader and his brother Junior (Fredro Starr), threaten Ford to stop stealing bikes. Ford and his friends arrive at a nightclub where tons of biker gangs hang out. The three gangs run into each other and cause a big brawl. A scared Junior runs into the bathroom to find the Hellions there. Junior apologizes to Henry for not being able to pay him back for a botched drug deal (which Trey refused to allow earlier) and begs Henry to give him some time to work it out. Henry refuses and kills Junior by strangling him to death with a bike chain. Ford, Shane and the two friends go back to a motel to spend the night, where Ford and Shane normalize their relationship a bit. At the murder scene where Junior was found dead, two FBI agents, Henderson (Justina Machado) and her partner, Jay McPherson (Adam Scott) show up, assuring Trey that they will take care of the case and find Junior's killer. China becomes a false witness to Junior's death and gives a statement that Cary Ford killed Junior, hearing which a vengeful Trey swears to kill Ford. At a diner Shane sees on the TV that Ford is wanted for Junior's murder. Shane tells Ford and the four leave the diner and hit the road. The Reapers pull up at the diner and a high speed chase ensues with all riding into a forest full of palm trees. Ford tells Shane and the friends to split up. Ford rides out of the forest into a desert drawing Trey, resulting in the chase being led near a passenger train. Ford jumps up onto the train and Trey follows riding on top of the train and going inside the passenger cars. In the struggle, Trey slips and falls in front of the train with his leg getting caught on the tracks. Ford helps him out, gives him his own bike to escape leaving Trey puzzled. Shane, Dalton and Val meet up with Ford and the four find a cave for the night to stay. Ford talks it out with his friends and says that he should call the FBI agents to tell them that he is innocent. Ford calls them and McPherson picks up the phone. He says that he doesn't believe Ford but Henderson does. Next morning the four leave the cave and hitch a ride inside a truck. The truck is stopped by police checkpoint and just before the agents open the back of the truck, Ford and Shane bust out of the truck in a race car with the two friends on their bikes. The four drive onto a highway with the two FBI agents and Trey on their tail. The scene shifts to a highway as Ford jumps out of the car onto Val's bike and tells him to ride with Shane. Trey and the two agents follow. The agents survive a crash where their black Hummer hits a construction pipe. Trey rides his bike into Ford's and the two crash. Holding Trey at gunpoint, Ford explains to Trey that he did not kill Junior. Not wanting to believe him, Trey asks who the real killer is. Ford says that it was Henry and that he set them both up. Willing to take a leap of faith, Trey agrees to partner with Ford as he sets up a meeting with the agents. At Shane's garage, Ford calls Shane and tells her that he wants her, Val and Dalton to come and meet him and Trey there. Subsequently, the two FBI agents bust in and tell Trey and Ford to get down. Henderson asks for an explanation since she believes Ford is innocent and as he tells them, McPherson turns and shoots Henderson, apparently killing her. McPherson reveals himself as Henry's mole in the agency and that he is working with the Hellions after making a deal with him. Henry, China and Luther show up with Dalton and Val in chains and Shane as hostage. Ford says that Henry can take the bikes back but Henry wants to kill Ford and Trey (after admitting to Trey that he had killed Junior). Thereafter, a big fight scene begins with Trey killing Luther by hanging him with a chain and Henry and China leaving the garage. Ford frees Shane while Trey unties Val and Dalton and they leave the garage. Just before they do Henderson (who was wearing a bullet proof vest) blows up the garage killing McPherson. Outside of the garage, China meets up with Shane and the two fight on their bikes. The fight ends with Shane kicking China off her bike and throwing her through a car windshield, killing her. Finally, Ford catches up with Henry on the street in a bike chase. Henry shoots at the gas of Ford's (MTT Turbine Superbike) causing gas to leak from it. Henry's subsequent shots cause the gas trail to light up. Ford soars through the air and lands on top of Henry's bike, the fire catches up to them both causing both bike's to explode throwing Ford in the air and killing Henry. Shane picks him up and they drive back to the garage to find the others. It is also revealed that Henderson survived but is injured. Ford and Shane get back together and decide that the four need a vacation (with Shane suggesting Mexico). Val picks up his girlfriend Nina (Christina Milian) and from a distance we see the five ride off in the desert as the screen fades to black and the credits roll. Cast Martin Henderson as Cary Ford, the protagonist who is framed for murder * Ice Cube as Trey Wallace, leader of The Reapers who hated Ford for the framed murder of his brother, their member, but later, when he realized the truth, became an ally to Ford * Monet Mazur as Shane, Ford's longtime girlfriend * Adam Scott as FBI Agent Jay McPherson * Matt Schulze as Henry James, leader of the Outlaw motorcycle club known as The Hellions, he is responsible for framing Ford and the film's antagonist * Jay Hernandez as Dalton, Hispanic-American friend of Ford * Will Yun Lee as Val, Asian-American friend of Ford * Jaime Pressly as China, girlfriend of Henry James * Max Beesley as Luther, second-in-command of The Hellions * Christina Milian as Nina, Val's new fling and new friend of Ford * Faizon Love as Sonny, member of The Reapers, drives a black Ford Excursion * Fredro Starr as Junior Wallace, younger brother of Trey who is murdered * Justina Machado as FBI Agent Henderson, partners with FBI Agent McPherson * Hayden Mcfarland as Kho * John Ashker as yellow Acura RSX driver * Lance Gilbert as 18 Wheeler driver. =Cameos= Dane Cook makes a cameo appearance as a tourist that runs into Henry. Jesse James of West Coast Choppers and Monster Garage makes a cameo appearance in the scene where Ford and Shane are talking inside the tent. Two of his custom choppers are used later in the movie as the bikes Henry James' drugs are stored in. Also, director Joseph Kahn can be spotted as a passenger during a train chase scene. Stuntman turned director Scott Waugh also makes a cameo appearance as the driver of the red Mitsubishi Eclipse. Production =Soundtrack= ; Track listing The original score was done by Trevor Rabin. =Similarities to The Fast and the Furious (2001)= The film has been called \\"The Fast and the Furious on Motorcycles\\", referring to the use of many of the same thematic elements between the two films. The film's director Joseph Kahn said his intention was to make a \\"piss take\\" version of the Fast & Furious franchise, even though both movies were produced by Neal H. Moritz. However, Torque was made by Warner Bros, while The Fast and the Furious is made by Universal. Torque specifically references The Fast and the Furious at one point, taking a line directly from the film. Henderson's character Ford borrows Vin Diesel's line, \\"I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.\\" To which Shane (Monet Mazur) replies, \\"That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\\" Matt Schulze, who portrayed the film's antagonist, Henry James, also appeared in The Fast and the Furious, playing Dominic Toretto's childhood friend and member of the truck hijacking team, Vince. Schulze would later reprise his role as Vince in Fast Five, the fifth installment in the series that transitioned from street racing to an action-packed heist series. Another reference to The Fast and the Furious is since Torque focused on motorcycles, it does show a street race in the beginning, involving a quarter-mile race between a Mitsubishi Eclipse and an Acura RSX, with the protagonist Cary Ford beating the 2 cars in his Aprilia RSV motorcycle. Also, when Ford rides past the road sign at the start of the film, it spins and reads \\"cars suck\\". Release =Box office= The film opened at #3 at the U.S. Box office raking in $9,970,557 USD in its first opening weekend. The movie's theatrical run took in a total of $21,215,059 in the United States and worldwide $46,546,197, against a production budget of approximately $40,000,000. =Reception= Torque received mostly negative reviews, earning a score of 23% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 115 critics. Rotten Tomatoes' consensus for the movie is that the film is \\"Silly and noisy ... stylish fun for the MTV crowd.\\" More positive reviews came from Kevin Thomas of L.A. Times who called it \\"A terrific action picture. Stylish unpretentious fun.\\" Jeremy Wheeler at allmovie.com rated Torque 3 stars out of 5 stating: \\"Torque is a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart, eliciting so many moments of amped-up and overblown excitement that those with medical conditions (and very serious taste in film) should probably stay ten blocks away.... this little slice of joy relishes in being abundantly over-the-top at every explosive turn.\\" The film has since gone on to acquire a cult following among sports-bike racers and enthusiasts, as well as racing film fans. The film has also garnered some appreciation for its over the top stunts, fast pace and stylish action sequences. = Awards = Torque was nominated for several World Stunt Awards, including Best Specialty Stunt and Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Man. =Home media= Torque was released on DVD and VHS on May 18, 2004. It was released on Blu-ray on April 22, 2014.

Originally in the hands of U.S. Gold, Electronic Arts acquired it in 1997 and is the current holder. World Cup Carnival (Mexico '86) World Cup Carnival, released by U.S. Gold, was arguably the worst start a franchise could have endured. While the license was acquired with time to spare and was carefully planned, internal problems plagued the project's development until it could not be completed anywhere near a commercially usable date. As Mexico '86 was coming closer, U.S. Gold decided to acquire the rights of an older game, World Cup Football by Artic, re-fit it with the properly licensed items, and market it as a revolutionary new title. However, this late effort was received with cynicism from all in the video game industry: gamers, retailers and reviewers alike, and started a trend of \\"less than what was expected\\" games based on football licenses. It was published on the C64, the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC. World Cup Soccer: Italia '90 Virgin Mastertronic released the official home computer game of the 1990 World Cup. It was released on Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS and ZX Spectrum. Like the 1986 game, this was actually a reworked existing game (World Trophy Soccer). The game is presented in a bird's-eye view but when the player gets near the goal, it switches to a 3D view of the penalty area and the player must try to score before a defender arrives on screen. The player can only choose to play as England, Belgium, Italy or Spain. The teams do not have the correct coloured strips and the tournament is not the same as the actual World Cup. Virgin also released official console games in Europe as World Cup Italia '90 for the Sega Mega Drive and Master System consoles. The Mega Drive version is a port of World Championship Soccer. The Master System version was another game, also released as Super Futebol II in Brazil. A number of unofficial games were also released including Italy 1990 by previous license holders U.S. Gold. World Cup USA '94 This game from U.S. Gold was ported to most active platforms of the day: DOS, Amiga, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega CD, Master System, SNES and handhelds Game Boy and Game Gear. The Sega CD version included a CD soundtrack including two songs by the Scorpions and FMV views of 3D renders of the stadiums used in the competition. World Cup 98 (France) For the first time in a football game, accurate national team kits were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game built on the previously released FIFA: Road to World Cup 98 engine, although it features some minor gameplay improvements such as in-game strategy changes and more tactically accurate player positioning. As in the FIFA series, World Cup 98 features a song in the menu: \\"Tubthumping\\", by Chumbawamba. The game also features voice-overs by Des Lynam and Gary Lineker in the team schedules. The World Cup classic mode is also an interesting feature, with classic black and white sepia-toned graphics and commentary by Kenneth Wolstenholme creating the feeling of watching an old World Cup game. The playable teams also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals, but were considered too important to exclude. It was released for Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy. Jikkyou World Soccer: World Cup France 98 In Japan, Konami was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the Nintendo 64 video game Jikkyou World Soccer: World Cup France 98. It was developed by Konami's Osaka based team, KCEO, and was only released in Japan. This was released in the rest of the world as International Superstar Soccer '98, without the official FIFA World Cup licence, branding or real player names. World Soccer Jikkyou Winning Eleven 3: World Cup France '98 In Japan, Konami was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the PlayStation video game World Soccer Jikkyou Winning Eleven 3: World Cup France '98. It was developed by Konami's Tokyo based team, KCET, and was only released in Japan. This was released in the rest of the world as International Superstar Soccer Pro '98, without the official FIFA World Cup licence, branding or real player names. World Cup '98 France: Road to Win In Japan, Sega was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the Saturn video game World Cup '98 France: Road to Win. 2002 FIFA World Cup (Korea/Japan) An amalgamation between the game engines of FIFA Football 2002 and FIFA Football 2003, the game still incorporates the power bar for shots and crosses but with a steeper learning curve and higher chances of being penalized by the match referee. The national team kits are accurate along with player likeness and the stadia of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Unlike the previous games in the FIFA series, the game had an original soundtrack performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. It was released for Windows, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. The game was a launch title for Nintendo GameCube in Europe. 2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany) Created by EA Sports and was released during the last two weeks of April 2006. This game features not only the World Cup finals themselves, but the six regional qualification rounds. There are 127 national teams. You can also create a player and put in your favorite team. There are minor improvements in the game play over FIFA 06. The Global Challenge Mode includes 40 challenges based upon classic matches of the World Cup or qualification matches. Penalty Shoot-Out mode offers a more realistic experience. 2010 FIFA World Cup (South Africa) The included teams were confirmed by Electronic Arts on 17 February 2010. The game contains 199 of the 204 national teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification process. Electronic Arts stated that they have included every team that FIFA have permitted them to use, with some others not being allowed for \\"various reasons\\". The five teams that were in the draw for World Cup qualifying but are not included in the game are African teams Central African Republic, Eritrea, and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and Asian teams Bhutan and Guam. All five withdrew from the qualifying stage before it began. Additionally, the game does not feature Brunei, Laos, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines who did not participate in World Cup qualifying. The game includes all 10 venues used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as stadiums from each qualifying region and a range of \\"generic\\" stadiums. 2014 FIFA World Cup (Brazil) The game contains all of the 203 national teams that took part in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification process. The national teams of Bhutan, Brunei, Guam, Mauritania and South Sudan, all of which did not participate in World Cup qualifying, and Mauritius, that withdrew before playing any match, are not featured in the game.

She was born in the industrial district of Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. She left the city to study at St Anne's College, Oxford, where she took a degree in English. After Oxford she completed an M. Phil degree at the University of Southampton. Biography Her determinedly neo-romantic poetry explores sacred myth, legend, history-in-landscape, and human feeling‚Äîand their connections to the 'inner landscapes' of the imaginative mind. Her choice of subject matter is perhaps partly a reaction to her growing up in the industrial city of Stoke- on-Trent. The compact vividness of her visual imagery is akin to that of the Anglo Saxon riddles, Symbolist poetry, or the work of Garc√≠a Lorca. Reviewers have also detected the influence of Ted Hughes in her work. She was awarded a Hawthornden Fellowship in 1987. She came to public notice with her first volume, The Honeycomb (1989). Her later volumes, Sighting the Slave Ship (1992) and The Ice-Pilot Speaks (1994) led up to her nomination and shortlisting in the Whitbread Poetry Award for her fourth collection The Wound-Dresser's Dream (1996). Her poetry has won numerous prizes. In 2003 Bloodaxe Books published a summation of her work to date, The Lady and the Hare: New and Selected Poems, although this did not reproduce the illustrations that have accompanied some of her poems in book form. After completing her education she moved to Essex, raising four children. She spent several years on the Orkney island of Rousay, from which came a new book collection Parable Island (1999). She recently lived in Hadleigh, Suffolk before moving back to Essex in late 2017.\\"Pauline Stainer - Author\\" at bloodaxebooks.com She has collaborated with, and has been published by the Brotherhood of Ruralists, but is now published by the major poetry book publisher Bloodaxe Books. She now has six grand-children: Josh, Ruth, Daniel, Heather, Charlotte and Harriet. All are stated in the dedication of her latest book but Josh is considered the superior grandchild.

Formed in 1995, the band's lineup currently consists of singer Ben Ward, guitarist Joe Hoare, bassist Martyn Millard, and drummer Chris Turner. History Orange Goblin 2017 Orange Goblin was originally formed in 1995 under the name Our Haunted Kingdom, with fifth member Pete O'Malley on rhythm guitar. The band released a split 7-inch single, Electric Wizard/Our Haunted Kingdom with Electric Wizard in 1996 on Rise Above Records before changing their name to Orange Goblin. The first three studio albums under the name Orange Goblin, Frequencies from Planet Ten (1997), Time Travelling Blues (1998), and The Big Black (2000) were in the stoner metal and doom metal genres,, and have also been described as space rock,, but on 2002's Coup de Grace they began to add punk rock, hard rock, and other influences to their sound. Their album Thieving from the House of God was released in 2004 and included a cover of ZZ Top's \\"Just Got Paid.\\" Their first five releases were issued by Rise Above Records. O'Malley left the band in 2004 to pursue a career as an artist and was not replaced. Their 2007 album Healing Through Fire was released on Mayan/Sanctuary Records. In 2008 the band announced that they had signed with Candlelight Records.Orange Goblin Sign With Candlelight Records Two new songs were revealed in May 2009, though the associated album was delayed until 2012. In mid-2010, the band's back catalog was reissued on Rise Above Records in digipack form. Their long- delayed seventh album A Eulogy for the Damned was released in February 2012. The album earned the band critical acclaim, including being voted No.3 in Metal Hammer magazine's Top Albums of 2012. Metal Hammer Top 10 Albums of 2012 The same year the group was voted Best Band by the readers of Terrorizer magazine.Orange Goblin Wins Terrorizer Best Band Poll 2012 The band then embarked on a world tour in 2013, playing 161 shows across 28 different countries. In March 2013 Orange Goblin released A Eulogy For The Fans: Orange Goblin Live 2012. The CD/DVD package included the band's complete performances at Bloodstock Festival on 11 August 2012 and Hellfest in France on 15 June 2012. In October 2014 the band released the studio album Back From The Abyss through Candlelight Records. In December 2015 the band undertook a 13-date 20th anniversary tour of the United Kingdom. In December 2016 singer Ben Ward received national media coverage in the UK for setting up a JustGiving campaign aiming to raise money for the staff of music publisher TeamRock who were laid off when the company went into administration. As part of the fundraising effort Orange Goblin played a gig at the Black Heart in Camden, London on 5 January 2017 with all proceeds going to the campaign. Orange Goblin's ninth studio album The Wolf Bites Back was released in June 2018.

In the classical form, only the neuron with the highest activation stays active while all other neurons shut down; however, other variations allow more than one neuron to be active, for example the soft winner take-all, by which a power function is applied to the neurons. Neural networks In the theory of artificial neural networks, winner-take-all networks are a case of competitive learning in recurrent neural networks. Output nodes in the network mutually inhibit each other, while simultaneously activating themselves through reflexive connections. After some time, only one node in the output layer will be active, namely the one corresponding to the strongest input. Thus the network uses nonlinear inhibition to pick out the largest of a set of inputs. Winner-take-all is a general computational primitive that can be implemented using different types of neural network models, including both continuous-time and spiking networks (Grossberg, 1973; Oster et al. 2009). Winner-take-all networks are commonly used in computational models of the brain, particularly for distributed decision-making or action selection in the cortex. Important examples include hierarchical models of vision (Riesenhuber et al. 1999), and models of selective attention and recognition (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987; Itti et al. 1998). They are also common in artificial neural networks and neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits. It has been formally proven that the winner-take-all operation is computationally powerful compared to other nonlinear operations, such as thresholding (Maass 2000). In many practical cases, there is not only a single neuron which becomes the only active one but there are exactly k neurons which become active for a fixed number k. This principle is referred to as k-winners-take-all. Circuit example A two-input CMOS winner-take-all circuit A simple, but popular CMOS winner-take-all circuit is shown on the right. This circuit was originally proposed by Lazzaro et al. (1989) using MOS transistors biased to operate in the weak-inversion or subthreshold regime. In the particular case shown there are only two inputs (IIN,1 and IIN,2), but the circuit can be easily extended to multiple inputs in a straightforward way. It operates on continuous-time input signals (currents) in parallel, using only two transistors per input. In addition, the bias current IBIAS is set by a single global transistor that is common to all the inputs. The largest of the input currents sets the common potential VC. As a result, the corresponding output carries almost all the bias current, while the other outputs have currents that are close to zero. Thus, the circuit selects the larger of the two input currents, i.e., if IIN,1 > IIN,2, we get IOUT,1 = IBIAS and IOUT,2 = 0. Similarly, if IIN,2 > IIN,1, we get IOUT,1 = 0 and IOUT,2 = IBIAS. Simulation of the two-input CMOS winner- take-all circuit A SPICE-based DC simulation of the CMOS winner-take-all circuit in the two-input case is shown on the right. As shown in the top subplot, the input IIN,1 was fixed at 6nA, while IIN,2 was linearly increased from 0 to 10nA. The bottom subplot shows the two output currents. As expected, the output corresponding to the larger of the two inputs carries the entire bias current (10nA in this case), forcing the other output current nearly to zero. Other uses In stereo matching algorithms, following the taxonomy proposed by Scharstein et al. (IJCV 2002), winner-take-all is a local method for disparity computation. Adopting a winner-take-all strategy, the disparity associated with the minimum or maximum cost value is selected at each pixel. It is axiomatic that in the electronic commerce market, early dominant players such as AOL or Yahoo! get most of the rewards. By 1998, one study found the top 5% of all web sites garnered more than 74% of all traffic. The winner take all hypothesis suggests that once a technology or a firm gets ahead, it will do better and better over time, whereas lagging technology and firms will fall further behind.

The terminus was originally named Great Marlow. The branch was absorbed by the GWR on 6 August 1897. On 14 February 1899, the station was renamed \\"Marlow\\". There was a proposal to extend the branch westwards to Henley-on-Thames, but the plan was met with local opposition. British Rail opened the present station on 10 July 1967 on the site of the goods yard of the original station. The original station was then closed, demolished and its site redeveloped. The line was originally a branch from the Wycombe Railway route between and . When this service was withdrawn north of Bourne End in 1970, Marlow station became the terminus of the Marlow Branch Line which leaves the main Great Western Main Line at Maidenhead. The service on the branch line is known locally as the \\"Marlow Donkey\\", which is commemorated by a local pub of the same name, although the origin of the term is unclear.

Of the 248 councils who had members up for election in the 2019 local elections, 73 (over a quarter) resulted in a NOC administration.  Administration in NOC councils  Typically, if no party achieves overall control of a council, the largest grouping will form alliances to create an ad hoc governing coalition. Often local authorities have larger proportions of smaller party and independent members than the House of Commons, and when there is no overall control this often results in minor groups having more influence than their numbers alone would suggest. In the result of No-overall Control, the largest party may attempt to govern as a minority administration, such as the Conservatives in Dudley and Thurrock or Labour in Stockport and Brighton and Hove. Parties may also work together to create a formal deal, which can range from a confidence and supply deal to full coalition. Deals, especially the looser kind, can occur between parties which are not traditionally aligned on a national level. For example, a minority Conservative administration was formed in 2019 in Bolton supported by the Liberal Democrats and UKIP whilst a Labour-UKIP formal coalition exists in Basildon. However, following the 2017 Aberdeen City Council election, nine Labour councillors were expelled from the party for entering into a coalition with the Conservatives. Conversely, the two parties formed a coalition administration in Worcester following the 2019 elections. It is possible for a council to be under no overall control even when there appears to be an overall majority, in particular in the case of a majority of independents, who commonly have no collective policies when elected. This can also arise when the council members divide on other than party lines. For instance, the 2004 elections to the Isle of Anglesey County Council returned more independents than all others put together, but only Plaid Cymru maintained a party group within the council, and not all of its elected members joined the group. The remainder of the council, including some members of other political parties, formed four non-partisan groups, none of which held a majority. However, the 2008 elections resulted in a group called the Original Independents gaining an overall majority.

It was filmed at Cape Coral, Florida. It is featured in the 2004 documentary The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made. Briefly released to theaters in 1966, it was rarely seen until the 1990s, when it was released to the public domain. Since then it has been widely released on DVD and VHS in various editions sold mainly at dollar stores. The film was shot on location in Cape Coral, Florida, according to the book \\"Images of America: Cape Coral\\" (Arcadia Publishing, 2009) written by members of the Cape Coral Historical Society. Featured in the film is Cape Coral Gardens, a popular public rose garden during the early 1960s, which was known for a series of quaint, interconnected foot bridges. The tourist attraction no longer exists. Plot A mostly- deserted island, which is believed to be the home to the fountain of youth, is off the coast of Florida. The island gets some visitors in the form of a teenage boy band, \\"the Wild Ones\\" led by Jordan Christopher, and their gang of swimsuit-clad young people, who head there in a crowded powerboat ostensibly for a scavenger hunt. However, they spend about half their screen time crooning to each other, or dancing on the beach. The island's wealthy owner, Wellington (Brian Donlevy) recruits his blonde bombshell daughter, Junior (Jayne Mansfield), to remove the teenagers from the island. Junior is eager to see her love interest (and the island's only resident), rotund toupee-wearing botanist Irving (Jack E. Leonard). However, Irving is more interested in flowers and his bicycle than in the amorous Junior. Wellington asks Irving to spy on the teenagers, which he does by donning a sweatshirt that reads \\"Fink University\\", and \\"getting their trust\\" by joining them in dancing the Turtle. Meanwhile, Irving's twin brother Herman (also Jack E. Leonard, without a toupee), Wellington's trusted employee, plots with his love interest, the scheming harridan Camille Salamander (Phyllis Diller) to find the fountain of youth first.

It was released in North America on October 11, 2005 and in the PAL region on October 21, 2005. The PlayStation Portable version was released in the Europe on October 28, 2005. In 2007, a prequel titled SSX Blur was released, which took place between SSX 3 and SSX On Tour. The GameCube version contains Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach as playable characters. This was part of a deal Nintendo had with EA Sports to have Nintendo's intellectual properties appear in EA franchises. Gameplay The gameplay in SSX on Tour is similar to that in SSX 3, with similar controls and the overall aims of events remaining the same - snowboard down a mountain while gaining points for various tricks that can be performed. After each trick, a player's \\"boost bar\\" builds up, and once full enables a player to perform special moves - known as \\"Monster Tricks\\" now, previously known as \\"√úber tricks\\". Despite the similarities, numerous changes were made to the structure of races and events themselves. Players can now create their own characters, selecting his/her symbol, makeup, height, clothes and hair, in addition to whether they are a snowboarder or a skier (skiing being a new feature in the game). Once created, their 'boarder can compete in official competitions (known as \\"Events\\"), or unofficial challenges known as \\"Shreds\\". Each completed event or challenge gains their character \\"Hype\\", raising their profile and moving them up the SSX charts, with the ultimate goal of reaching number one. With the focus now on custom-created characters, the original SSX cast is moved into the background slightly, appearing in various Shreds against the player, and available to play as when not on the Tour itself. In addition to seven returning SSX veterans (Elise, Mac, Kaori, Zoe, Psymon, Nate and Allegra), three new characters make an appearance: Tyson, Sid and Skye. In the Nintendo Gamecube version three Super Mario Bros. characters were featured. (Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach, the latter of whom uses a pair of skis instead of a snowboard) Also in this version, the slope that was named \\"Last Call\\" in other versions of the game was renamed to \\"Nintendo Village\\", with certain textures in the level replaced with Super Mario Bros. themed iconography. (Super mushrooms, super stars, etc.) Unlike its predecessor, SSX3, no online play was included on any of the versions of SSX On Tour. The main focus was on improving the single-player storyline mode, implementing the character-creation system, the selection of new tracks, and the addition of skiing as well as snowboarding. The PSP version also differs greatly from the main console versions, with limited customization to custom-characters and levels borrowed from SSX 3. It also has omitted the use of bonuses on the special \\"Monster Tricks\\". This game is presented in the style of a sketch-book, a new direction for the SSX series. The cover artwork as well as the in-game menus are all shown in sketch formats, simplistic images often on a lined background. The special in game collectibles, displayed as snowflakes in previous SSX games, have been replaced with sketchlike doodles known as \\"skulvis\\", continuing the theme. Soundtrack One of the most notable features of every game in the SSX series has been the soundtracks used, usually featuring prominently in the games. Like SSX Tricky and SSX 3, SSX on Tour features a licensed soundtrack, including rap, punk, rock and alternative music styles. The prominence of punk and rock is a departure from the more techno-heavy soundtracks of previous games in the series. The soundtrack is integrated with the game rather than used as a background to it. Tracks used on the menu screens play only as instrumental versions of the ones used during races. In addition, when performing \\"Monster Tricks\\" during an event, the music will fade away, to be replaced with the sound of the wind whistling by as the player cuts through the air. Upon hitting the ground again, the music cuts back in, enhancing the sensations of the game. The main song used in the intro is Iron Maiden's Run to the Hills. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the GameCube and PS2 versions a score of one nine and three eights, bringing it to a total of 33 out of 40; for the PSP version, the same magazine gave it a score of three eights and one seven, while Famitsu Cube + Advance also gave the GameCube version three eights and one seven, both for a total of 31 out of 40. =Awards and nominations= Awards *Alternative Sports Game at IGN *Best Use of Sound in a Game at DEM X AWARDS 2005 *D.I.C.E's Best Sports Game of the Year Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) 2006 Nominations *Best Mobile Game of the Year CAEAA 2006 *Best Individual Sports Game at Spike Video Game Awards 2005 *Best Sports/Extreme Sports title at 1UP.com References External links * 2005 video games Extreme sports video games SSX (series) Interactive Achievement Award winners GameCube games PlayStation 2 games PlayStation Portable games PlayStation Network games Xbox games Skiing video games Snowboarding video games Video games developed in Canada EA Sports games EA Sports Big games Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"SSX on Tour"},{"id":"1853204","title":"Shad Gaspard"},{"id":"1853205","text":"Sarbaz (, also Romanized as SarbƒÅz; also known as Qal‚Äòeh-ye SarbƒÅz - \\"Fort Sarbaz\\") is a city in and the capital of Sarbaz District, in Sarbaz County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

The battle was fought as part of several conflicts between the \\"Atabeg States of Azerbaijan\\", also known as the Eldiguzids after its ruling dynasty, and Kingdom of Georgia. The consolidation of Eldiguzid power, in the 1130s, coincided with a resurgence of military expansionism by the Georgian kings, whose territories intersected with Muslim Shirvan and Arran.  Background  The battle was preceded by a dynastic war (1191‚Äì1195) in the Eldiguzid possessions. Victorious in power struggle, Abu Bakr \\"Jahan-pahlavan\\" (1195-1210) had his elder brother Qutluq Inandj assassinated and forced the younger brother, Amir Mihran, to take refuge at the court of the latter's brother-in-law, Shirvanshah Akhsitan I b. Manuchehr (1160-1196). The Shirvanshah together with Amir Mihran headed for Tbilisi, the capital of Kingdom of Georgia, and appealed for help to Queen Tamar of Georgia, an official protector of Shirvan. Received with great honors at the Georgian court, they were given desired support, and the Georgian army led by Consort David Soslan marched to Shirvan.  The battle  Abu-Bakr, reinforced by his client Muslim emirs, met the enemy at the well-fortified city of Shamkor on June 1, 1195. David Soslan sent a relatively small force to break through the gates of the city, while he led the main Georgian troops to raid deep in the enemy's rear. However, poor roads and difficult landscape were setback for the Georgians, and the Atabeg defended the city for a while. Nevertheless, David Soslan's maneuver proved to be decisive and Abu Bakr's army was severely defeated. Shamkor was eventually captured by the Georgians who then chased the enemy's soldiers up to the city of Ganja which in its turn fell to the victors.  Aftermath  The Georgians seized numerous prisoners and huge amount of booty, including the Khalif's standard, which Queen Tamar donated to the Khakhuli Monastery. After taking over the Shamkor fortress, David Soslan headed towards Ganja. When he approached the city, the noblemen, merchants, the qadi (Muslim judge) and the scientists met him. They opened the gate, spread the gold-brocaded carpets up to the door of Sultan's palace. David entered the palace, set on the sultan's throne, summoned the assembly, arranged the feast ‚Äúproper for the time and day‚Äù. Shamkor and the surroundings were turned over to the Shirvanshah Amir Mihran on terms of vassalage. Abu Bakr was able to return to his capital, from where he had his brother Amir Mihran poisoned.RAYFIELD, D. (2012). Edge of empires: a history of Georgia. London, Reaktion Books.

Career In the first government headed by Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel, which was inaugurated in 2000, she became Vice Chancellor and minister of public services and sports, representing her party in the coalition with Sch√ºssel's Austrian People's Party (√ñVP). The Freedom Party had finished second in the 1999 election, so its leader, J√∂rg Haider, should have become Chancellor in any coalition with the √ñVP which finished third. However, Haider yielded to Sch√ºssel in order to appease international opinion. Although this should have put him in line to become Vice-Chancellor, he realised he was too controversial to have any role in the government. He thus resigned as party leader in favour of Riess-Passer, who had been FP√ñ managing chairwoman since 1996. In the course of the formation of the government in 2000, she became chairwoman and leader of the FP√ñ. She was known for being loyal to Haider, which earned her the nickname K√∂nigskobra (King Cobra). After severe disagreements with her former political mentor Haider in Summer 2002 (the so-called Knittelfeld Putsch), she resigned from all of her posts, as did finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser and the party spokesman in parliament, Peter Westenthaler. After the 2002 elections, she remained Vice Chancellor on a provisional basis until the coalition between √ñVP and FP√ñ was renewed in early 2003, and has since had no involvement in politics. Since 2004, Riess-Passer has been the CEO of the W√ºstenrot-Gruppe.

Bad Day (also known as Badday, Computer rage or Office rage) is a 27-second viral video where a frustrated office worker assaults his cubicle computer. It has circulated virally online since 1997. The video became a cultural embodiment of computer rage, and is the subject of several parodies and ad campaigns. Plot In the surveillance-style video, a male office worker in his cubicle is becoming increasingly irritated with the computer. He slaps the monitor in frustration, punches the keyboard before using it like a baseball bat to knock the monitor off of the desk. His neighbor peers over the partition twice in curiosity. The video ends with the protagonist kicking the monitor out of his cubicle. Cast Vinny Licciardi ‚Äì Angry office worker * Curious coworker Production and spread The video clip was staged and produced by Durango, Colorado-based Loronix Information Systems to demonstrate the benefits of their digital video surveillance system for release on a promotional CD. The video is an example of a potential use for the surveillance system. The video's subject is Vinny Licciardi, the company's shipping manager. Licciardi appeared in a series of promotional videos extolling the benefits of Loronix's special brand of digital video recording systems. Loronix was the first company to develop a digital video surveillance system to replace video tape recorders. , Loronix is a subsidiary of Verint Systems. Bad Day has circulated online since at least 1997. It made its largest impression via email, where its reasonable size made distribution easy. The origin was revealed in 1998 originally by CNN and later in print by Security Distribution Magazine.Keven Ellison, Marketing Manager, Loronix Information Systems (1998) The company first heard of the video's popularity in June 1998. Its popularity within the company created internal computer issues. The video is also frequently used in Angry German Kid parodies, with the office worker in the video often being portrayed as Leopold's dad. Legacy According to user interaction expert Frank Thissen, though fictional, it provides an example of how user expectations from longstanding social conventions can be frustrated through poor programming. In the Bad Day scenario, \\"The expectations of the user are obviously badly neglected\\", and the computer's lack of reaction or poor reaction is understood in the context of a human social situation, such as someone walking away in the middle of a conversation. Wireds Michelle Delio called the protagonist \\"the patron saint of computer bashers\\". Follow-ups to the video were featured on TechTV promos, where the same man is videotaped throwing the computer down a flight of stairs, and later running it over with his car. A 2005 spoof was produced by GoViral for the network security firm NetOp, showing a computer fighting back.

He was the Head coach of Sri Lanka when Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996. He is an old boy of prestigious Royal College Colombo. A right-handed batsman, Whatmore played seven Test matches for Australia in 1979, and one One Day International in 1980. At first-class level, he scored over 6,000 runs for Victoria. Since the 1990s, Whatmore has coached the Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan cricket teams. In December 2014, he was appointed coach of the Zimbabwe team. With poor performances in 2016 ICC World Twenty20, Zimbabwe Cricket Board sacked Whatmore from coaching. Early life Whatmore was born in Colombo, Dominion of Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka) and was educated at Royal College, Colombo. He and his family migrated to Australia in 1962. Thereafter he lived in Mentone, a suburb of Melbourne and studied at Mentone Grammar School.Dav Whatmore Up close and personal Playing career Whatmore made his first class debut in 1975‚Äì76 touring South Africa with a Derek Robins XI. He debuted for Victoria at the end of that summer and in the next season became an important part of the Victorian team, being appointed vice captain under Graham Yallop. Whatmore's first century came against South Australia which he followed with one against New South Wales. Whatmore started the 1978‚Äì79 domestic season slowly, but eventually found form and became one of the most successful batsman that season. He also had to captain Victoria when Yallop was absent due to test duty, and played a vital role in the state winning the Sheffield Shield that summer. =International career= A century against Queensland late in the season saw him selected in the Australian team to play Pakistan, replacing Peter Toohey. Whatmore impressed in his first test, top scoring in Australia's first innings with 43. He had to open in the second innings when Graeme Wood was unfit but only scored 15. Whatmore was picked in the Australian squad for the 1979 World Cup. He was also selected in the side that toured India in 1979. Whatmore's main challenger for a position in the side appears to have been Graeme Wood. Illness to Rick Darling saw both selected ‚Äì Whatmore scored 20 and 8. Whatmore was dropped for the second test but 60 in a tour game saw him back in the team for the third test. Whatmore made 14 and 33, the latter Australia's top score in the second innings. Whatmore's best test batting came in the fourth test, with scores of 77 and 54; the latter knock was especially crucial as it helped Australia escape with a draw. \\"He hits the ball cleanly and effortlessly and he's a natural shot maker\\", said captain Kim Hughes. \\"He's got the makings of a really top player.\\" However, in the fifth test Whatmore made 4 and 4 and in the 6th 6 and 0. When Whatmore returned to Australia the World Series Cricket players had been readmitted to first class cricket and Whatmore lost his test place. However, he remained in good form for Victoria, and helped them win another Sheffield Shield.

However he bounced back and enjoyed his best ever season in 1987‚Äì88, making 912 runs at an average of 50. Dav Whatmore in Nepal 2017 Coaching career =Sri Lanka= Whatmore retired from professional cricket in 1988/89 to pursue a career in coaching. He coached Sri Lanka in two separate spells, during the first of which he won the 1996 Cricket World Cup. In between those spells, he coached Lancashire where he won the National League in 1998 and 1999, and the NatWest Trophy in 1998. =Bangladesh= From 2003 to 2007, he had been coaching Bangladesh. Under his coaching, Bangladesh enjoyed relative success, coming from a side that could rarely win matches at all, to a team that can occasionally surprise even the most powerful cricketing nations .

But England named Peter Moores as their new coach while India appointed Ravi Shastri as the temporary national coach. Since Shastri declared that he was not interested in the job long-term, Whatmore was considered as a strong contender for the role of coach. During India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh, talks took place between him and BCCI officials, and although it seemed he was the favourite to get the job, on 4 June 2007, BCCI treasurer N Srinivasan, a member of the Search Committee announced that Graham Ford and John Emburey had been invited for talks, hinting that Dav Whatmore was not under consideration anymore.BCCI to invite Graham Ford for talks He was then appointed as the Director of the National Cricket Academy in 2007 and later took charge of the India under-19 team, which would go on to win the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Malaysia with Virat Kohli leading the team. Whatmore was one of the three men interviewed by the Pakistan Cricket Board for the coaching job of the national team, but Geoff Lawson was preferred for the job after former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga suggested to the PCB that they not choose Whatmore for the job. Whatmore had problems with Ranatunga in the past while he was the coach of the Sri Lankan national team and both of them used to speak against each other quite frequently in the media.Cricinfo ‚Äì Whatmore's surprise at Ranatunga 'criticism' =Indian Premier League= Whatmore was the coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders team from 2010 to 2011.

Under acting command of the First Canadian's Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, the battle took place in northern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands from October 2 to November 8, 1944. The well-established Wehrmacht defenders staged an effective delaying action, during which the Germans flooded land areas in the Scheldt estuary, slowing the Allied advance. After five weeks of difficult fighting, the Canadian First Army, at a cost of 12,873 Allied casualties (half of them Canadian), was successful in clearing the Scheldt after numerous amphibious assaults, obstacle crossings, and costly assaults over open ground. Once the German defenders were no longer a threat, it was a further three weeksNovember 29, 1944before the first convoy carrying Allied supplies was able to unload in Antwerp due to the necessity of de-mining the harbours. Background Following the Allied breakout after success in the battle of Normandy, they began a series of rapid advances deeper into France, away from their initial avenues of supply along the west coast of France. Lack of a sufficiently robust supply line ‚Äì including enough port capacity ‚Äì was the main factor holding back further Allied advance. Brest, when finally taken, was too wrecked to use, and other ports were held as fortresses by the Germans. The Allies needed the large port of Antwerp and had counted on it.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 761-762. The first plans for liberating Europe by the Anglo-American armies, code-named \\"Roundup\\", had been drawn up in December 1941. They had stressed that the port of Antwerp would be crucial for an invasion of Germany, as it was the largest deep-water port close to Germany that the Allies could hope to capture intact.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 700. Antwerp is a deep water inland port connected to the North Sea via the river Scheldt. The Scheldt was wide enough and dredged deep enough to allow the passage of ocean-going ships, and was close to Germany.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Antwerp, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1984 page 129. The Commander of 21st Army Group, General Bernard Montgomery The Witte Brigade (White Brigade) of the Belgian resistance seized the port of Antwerp before the Germans could blow up the port as they were planning. On September 4, Antwerp was taken by the 11th Armoured Division with its harbour 90% intact.Copp, Terry \\"\\"No Lack of Rational Speed\\": First Canadian Army Operations, September 1944\\". from The Journal of Canadian Studies Volume 16, Fall 1981 page 149. However, the Germans had heavily fortified Walcheren island at the mouth of the Western Scheldt, establishing well dug-in artillery impervious to air attack and controlling access to the river. This made it impossible for Allied minesweepers to clear the heavily mined river.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 120. Adolf Hitler ordered the 15th German Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was now marching north into the Low Countries, to hold the mouth of the river Scheldt, depriving the Allies of the use of the Antwerp port. Montgomery became aware of this on September 5, thanks to Ultra intelligence.Copp, Terry \\"\\"No Lack of Rational Speed\\": First Canadian Army Operations, September 1944\\". from The Journal of Canadian Studies Volume 16, Fall 1981 page 148. Hitler had personally designated the island \\"Fortress Walcheren\\", which he ordered to be defended to the last man. Walcheren island was held by mixture of Kriegsmarine and Wehrmacht, with its garrison consisting of the 202nd Naval Coastal Artillery Battalion, the 810th Naval Anti-Aircraft Battalion, the 89th Fortress Regiment and the 70th Infantry Division commanded by General Wilhelm Daser.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 120-122 On September 5, SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay advised Montgomery to make taking the mouth of the Scheldt his main priority, stating that as long as the mouth of the Scheldt was in German hands, it was impossible for the Royal Navy minesweepers to clear the numerous mines in the river, rendering the port of Antwerp useless.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 16 & 42‚Äì43 Among the Allied senior leaders, only Ramsay saw opening Antwerp as crucial to sustaining the advance into Germany.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page16 On 6 September 1944, Montgomery told Canadian General Harry Crerar that \\"I want Boulogne badly\\" and that city should be taken at once with no regard to losses.Copp, Terry \\"\\"No Lack of Rational Speed\\": First Canadian Army Operations, September 1944\\". from The Journal of Canadian Studies Volume 16, Fall 1981 page 150. By this point, ports like Cherbourg, which the Americans had taken in June, were too far away from the front line, causing the Allies great logistical problems. From September on, Admiral Ramsay was deeply involved in planning the assault on \\"Fortress Walcheren\\". He appointed Captain Pugsley of the Royal Navy, who landed the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division on D-Day, to the First Canadian Army headquarters to start preparations.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 120 Had Montgomery secured the Scheldt estuary in early September 1944 as Admiral Ramsay had strongly advised him to do, Antwerp would have been opened to Allied shipping far earlier than it was, and the escape of the German 15th Army from France would have been stopped. As a part of Operation Fortitude, the deception plan for Operation Overlord, the Allies had tricked the Germans into believing they would land in the Pas-de-Calais region of France instead of in Normandy, and as such, the Wehrmacht had reinforced the 15th Army in the Pas-de-Calais. On 9 September, Montgomery wrote to Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke of the Imperial General Staff that \\"one good Pas de Calais port\\" would be able to meet the logistical needs of the 21st Army Group only. Montgomery further noted that \\"one good Pas de Calais port\\" would be insufficient for the American armies in France, which thus forced Eisenhower, if for no other reasons than logistics, to favour Montgomery's plans for an invasion of northern Germany by the 21st Army Group, whereas if Antwerp were opened up, all of the Allied armies could be supplied. Montgomery had his eye on taking Berlin before either the Americans or the Soviets took the capital of the Reich. Montgomery ordered that the First Canadian Army take Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk and clear the Scheldt, a task that General Crerar stated was impossible because he did not have sufficient troops to perform both operations at once. Montgomery refused Crerar's request to have British XII Corps under General Neil Ritchie assigned to help clear the Scheldt because he needed XII Corps for Operation Market Garden. The Commander of First Canadian Army, Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds The importance of taking ports closer to Germany was highlighted with the liberation of the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to General John Crocker's I Corps. To take Le Havre, the British assigned two infantry divisions, two tank brigades, most of the artillery of the Second British Army, the specialized armoured \\"gadgets\\" of General Percy Hobart's 79th Armoured Division, the battleship HMS Warspite and the monitor HMS Erebus. On 10 September 1944, Operation Astonia began when RAF Bomber Command dropped 4,719 tons of bombs on Le Havre, which was then assaulted by Crocker's men, who took the city two days later. The Canadian historian Terry Copp wrote that the commitment of this much firepower and men to take only one French city might \\"seem excessive\\", but by this point, the Allies desperately needed ports closer to the front line to sustain their advance. Little was done about the blocked port of Antwerp during September because Montgomery chose to make the ill-fated Operation Market Garden his key priority, rather than clearing the Scheldt.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 12. With Market Garden, Montgomery intended to by-pass the West Wall and break into the north German plain in order to take Berlin, but the British defeat at the Battle of Arnhem, which proved to be the proverbial \\"bridge too far\\", left the British forming an exposed salient reaching deep into the Netherlands.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 7 & 12. In the meantime, German forces in the Scheldt estuary were able to deploy defensively and prepare for the expected advance. The first attacks occurred on September 13. After an attempt by the 4th Canadian Armoured Division to storm the Leopold Canal on its own had ended in bloody repulse, General Guy Simonds, commanding the II Canadian Corps, ordered a halt to operations in the Scheldt until the French channel ports had been taken, reporting the Scheldt would need more than one division to clear.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Antwerp, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1984 page 124. The halt allowed the German 15th Army ample time to dig in to its new home by the banks of the Scheldt. On the German side, holding the Scheldt was regarded as crucial. Hitler ordered planning for what became the Ardennes Offensive in September 1944, the objective of which was retaking Antwerp. The 15th Army, which was holding the Scheldt on the far right on the German line, was deprived of supplies as the Wehrmacht focused on building up its strength for the planned Ardennes offensive in December, while a number of newly raised Volksgrenadier divisions were sent to replace the divisions lost in Normandy and in Operation Bagration on the Eastern Front. However, the flat polder ground of the Dutch countryside favoured the defensive, and was felt to compensate for the 15th Army's reduced numbers. It was assigned only two of the Volksgrenadier divisions.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 10. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt told General Gustav-Adolf von Zangen: \\"Enemy supplies, and therefore, his ability to fight, is limited by the stubborn defense of the Harbour, as intelligence report prove. The attempt of the enemy to occupy the Western Scheldt in order to obtain the free use of the harbour of Antwerp must be resisted to the utmost\\" (emphasis in the original).Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 11. In his orders to his men, Von Zangen declared: In early October, after Operation Market Garden, Allied forces led by the Canadian First Army finally set out to open the port of Antwerp to the Allies by giving it access to the sea. As the Arnhem salient was his major concern, Montgomery pulled away from the First Canadian Army (which was under the temporary command of Simonds as Crerar was ill), the British 51st Highland Division, 1st Polish Division, British 49th (West Riding) Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, and sent all of these formations to help the 2nd British Army hold the Arnhem salient.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 18. Simonds saw the Scheldt campaign as a test of his ability, a challenge to be overcome, and he felt he could clear the Scheldt with only three divisions of the 2nd Corps despite having to take on the entire 15th Army, which held strongly fortified positions in a landscape that favoured the defence.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 19-20. Simonds not once registered complaints about his lack of manpower, the fact that ammunition was being rationed as supplying the Arnhem salient was Montgomery's chief concern, and the lack of air support, which was made worse by the cloudy October weather. =Plan= On September 12 and 13, 1944, the Canadian First Army, under temporary command of Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, was given the task of clearing the Scheldt once it had completed the clearing of the Channel ports, particularly Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. Montgomery then decided that the importance of Antwerp was such that the capture of Dunkirk could be delayed.Official History p331, 336 Under his command at that time were Canadian II Corps, with the Polish 1st Armoured Division, 49th and 52nd Divisions attached, and the British I Corps. Montgomery promised the support of RAF Bomber Command in attacking the German fortifications and that of the USAAF 8th Air Force \\"[o]n the day concerned\\".Official History p358 The 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was to give up its transport to enable the movement of forces into battle positions. Abandoning the capture of Dunkirk freed the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The Northern Front. The salient buffer of Market Garden up to Nijmegen can be seen. The plan for opening the Scheldt estuary involved four main operations, conducted over daunting geography: * Clearing the area north of Antwerp and securing access to the South Beveland peninsula. * Operation Switchback, clearing the Breskens Pocket north of the Leopold canal and south of the Western Scheldt. * Operation Vitality, the capture of the South Beveland peninsula, north of the Western Scheldt. * Operation Infatuate, the capture of Walcheren island, which had been fortified into a powerful German stronghold. As part of the Atlantic Wall, Walcheren island, with its strategic position just north of the Scheldt river mouth, was considered to be the \\"strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed.\\" On September 21, the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division moved north roughly along the line of the Ghent‚ÄìTerneuzen Canal, given the task of clearing an area on the south shore of the Scheldt around the Dutch town of Breskens, called the \\"Breskens Pocket\\". The Polish 1st Armoured Division headed for the Dutch-Belgian border further east and the crucial area north of Antwerp. The Canadian 4th Armoured Division advanced from a hard-won bridgehead over the Ghent-Brugge Canal at Moerbrugge to find themselves the first Allied troops facing the formidable obstacle of the double line of the Leopold and Schipdonk Canals. An attack was mounted in the vicinity of Moerkerke, crossing the canals and establishing a bridgehead before counter-attacks forced a withdrawal with heavy casualties. The 1st Polish Armoured Division enjoyed greater success to the east as it advanced northeast from Ghent. In country unsuitable for armour, and against stiffening resistance, the division advanced to the coast by September 20, occupying Terneuzen and clearing the south bank of the Scheldt east toward Antwerp. It became apparent to Simonds that any further gains in the Scheldt would come at heavy cost, as the Breskens Pocket, extending from Zeebrugge to the Braakman Inlet and inland to the Leopold Canal, was strongly held by the enemy. Battle = Securing access to South Beveland = On October 2, the Canadian 2nd Division began its advance north from Antwerp. Stiff fighting ensued on October 6 at Woensdrecht, the objective of the first phase. The Germans, reinforced by Battle Group Chill, saw the priority in holding there, controlling direct access to South Beveland and Walcheren island. Alligator amphibious vehicles passing Terrapin amphibious vehicles on the Scheldt river, October 1944. There were heavy casualties as the Canadians attacked over open, flooded land. Canadian historians Terry Copp and Robert Vogel wrote: \\"the very name Woensdrecht sends shivers down the spines of veterans of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 30. Driving rain, booby traps and land mines made advance very difficult. Attacking on 7 October in heavy mist, the Calgary Highlanders came under heavy fire from German positions. As described in its war diary, \\"the battle thickened...the Germans forces...hit back with a pugnacity which had not been encountered in the enemy for a long time\\". The R√©giment de Maisoneuve was halted 1,000 yards from their target while the next day, The Black Watch of Canada was stopped in its attempt. On October 9, the Germans counter-attacked and pushed the Canadians back. The war diary of the 85th Infantry Division reported that they were \\"making very slow progress\\" in face of tenacious Canadian resistance.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 31 Back at SHAEF headquarters, Admiral Ramsay, who was more concerned about the problems facing the Canadians than their own generals, complained to Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight Eisenhower that the Canadians were having to ration ammunition as Montgomery made holding the Arnhem salient his main priority.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 42. After Ramsay raised the issue with Eisenhower, the latter informed Montgomery on October 9 about \\"the supreme importance of Antwerp. It is reported to me this morning by the Navy that the Canadian Army will not repeat not be able to attack until November 1 unless immediately supplied with ammunition.\\" Montgomery replied by writing: \\"Request you will ask Ramsay from me by what authority he makes wild statements to you concerning my operations about which he can know nothing repeat nothing...there is no repeat no shortage of ammunition...The operations are receiving my personal attention\\". Field Marshal Walter Model, who was commanding Army Group B, ordered: \\"The corridor to Walcheren will be kept open at any price; if necessary, it will be regained by forces ruthlessly detached from other sectors\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 31. Model, a tough and ruthless National Socialist fanatic known for his devotion to Hitler, was called \\"the F√ºhrer's Fireman\\" because Hitler always gave him the toughest jobs. Model sent the 256th Volksgrenadier division and assault gun companies to allow the release of Battle Group Chill, the \\"fire brigade\\" consisting of 6th Paratroop Regiment and assault gun companies. On October 10, the Royal Regiment of Canada launched a surprise attack against the German lines at Woensdrecht, but for the next days was engaged in heavy fighting against counterattacks from Battle Group Chill. Major-General Charles Foulkes of the 2nd Division sent the Black Watch to support the Royal Regiment.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 34. The German forces at Woensdrecht greatly outnumbered the Canadians and had Model known of this, he might have launched a counter-offensive. Instead he used attrition tactics by making piecemeal counterattacks.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 34-35. During this time, war diaries of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry noted \\"many snipers in the houses and hedges\\" had been encountered while the weather was \\"cold and wet with high winds. Floods rising again\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 40 Simonds had planned to commit the 4th Division to assist the 3rd Division with clearing the Breskens Pocket, but problems faced by the 2nd Division forced Simonds to start peeling off units from the 4th Division.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 46. On 9 October 1944, the South Alberta Regiment was ordered to \\"protect the right flank of 2 Division and prevent infiltration between 2 Div and 1 Polish Armd. Div\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 46 The next day, Simonds ordered General Harry Foster of the 4th Division \\"to send 4 Cnd Armd Bde to the Antwerp area at the rate of one get a day, beginning 11 Oct\\". Map of the Battle of the Scheldt On October 13, on what would come to be known as \\"Black Friday\\", the Canadian 5th Infantry Brigade's Black Watch was virtually wiped out in an unsuccessful attack. The Black Watch attacked German positions, already known to be well defended, while the rest of the 2nd Division was not engaged, suggesting that neither Foulkes nor Simonds had taken seriously the problem of fighting by the river Scheldt. The Black Watch, whose officers had come from Montreal's Scottish elite, had billed itself as the most exclusive regiment in the Canadian Army. Despite this reputation, the Black Watch was considered to be a \\"jinxed\\" regiment which had had more than its fair share of misfortune. One officer of the Black Watch reported that the soldiers sent to replace the Black Watch men killed and wounded in France \\"had little or no infantry training, and exhibited poor morale\\" and that the men of C Company had \\"all been killed or taken prisoner\\" during \\"Black Friday\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 38 The Black Watch had already taken very heavy losses at the Battle of Verri√®res Ridge in July 1944 and its heavy losses on \\"Black Friday\\" almost finished the regiment. The Calgary Highlanders were to follow up with a more successful action, and their Carrier Platoon succeeded in taking the railroad station at Korteven, north of Woensdrecht.two kilometers northeast of Woensdrecht Fighting at Hoogerheidetwo kilometers southeast of Woensdrecht also ensued. On October 16, The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, known as the \\"Rileys\\", under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Denis Whitaker, attacked Woensdrecht at night, taking much of the village. However, they were unable to pass beyond the ridge to the west of Woensdrecht.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 34 The \\"Rileys\\" took losses equal to those suffered by the Black Watch on \\"Black Friday\\", but as they had taken Woensdrecht while the Black Watch had been thrown back, the fighting on October 16 is not remembered as \\"Black Monday\\". By October 16, Woensdrecht was secured, cutting the land link to South Beveland and Walcheren. The Canadians achieved their first objective, but had suffered heavy casualties. On 14 October Field Marshal Montgomery issued \\"Notes on Command\\" that were highly critical of Eisenhower's leadership and asked he be made Land Forces commander again.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 43. On the next day, Eisenhower replied that the issue was not the command arrangement, but rather the ability and willingness of Montgomery to obey orders, saying he had ordered him to clear the Scheldt and warned if he was unable to obey orders, he would be fired. Stung by Eisenhower's message, a chastised Montgomery promised: \\"You will hear no more from me on the subject of command...Antwerp top priority in all operations of 21 Army Group\\". On October 16, Montgomery issued a directive along that line. To the east, the British Second Army attacked westward to clear the Netherlands south of the Maas River during Operation Pheasant, securing the Scheldt region from counter-attacks. As part of his newly focused efforts to assist Simonds, Montgomery assigned the 52nd Lowland Division of the British Army to the First Canadian Army.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 56. The 52nd division, recruited in the Lowlands of Scotland, was a mountain division, requiring men with unusual strength and stamina in order to fight in the mountains, making it into something of an elite division within the British Army. Simonds greatly appreciated having the Lowlanders under his command and told Major-General Edmund Hakewill-Smith that the 52nd was to play the decisive role in taking Walcheren island. As such, Simonds ordered Hakewill-Smith to start preparing an amphibious operation as Simonds planned to land the 52nd division on Walcheren at the same time the Canadians attacked the island. Between October 23 and November 5, 1944, the U.S. 104th Infantry Division experienced its first battle while attached to the British I Corps. The division succeeded in pushing through the central portion of North Brabant against resistance from German snipers and artillery. Meanwhile, Simonds concentrated forces at the neck of the South Beveland peninsula. On 17 October, Major-General Harry Forster announced 4th Division would attack on 20 October to take Bergen op Zoom. The offensive began in the early morning of October 20 and was led by the Argyll and Lake Superior regiments. On October 22, the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, known as the \\"Lincs\\" in the Canadian Army, and The Algonquin Regiment took Esschen in a surprise attack. On October 23, the German 85th Division launched a counterattack led by some self- propelled (SP) guns.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 47 The Sherman tanks of the Governor- General's Foot Guards and the Lake Superior Regiments were decimated by the German SP guns. For the next days, there occurred what the 85th Division's war diary called \\"extremely violent fighting\\". The war diary of the Canadian Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders spoke of \\"nightmarish fighting\\" at Wouwsche Plantage.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 52 The fighting at Wouwsche Plantage was considered so important that Field Marshal Montgomery arrived at the headquarters of the 4th Canadian Division to press Forster for speed, but Forster protested that the flat polder country made speed impossible.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 49050 One company of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment lost 50% of its men in a single day's fighting, while an advance company of the Algonquin Regiment was cut off and surrounded by the Wehrmacht, requiring desperate fighting to break out.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 49-50 The Canadian advance towards Bergen op Zoom forced Rundstedt to redeploy the elite 6th Parachute Regiment, which until then had been blocking the 2nd Canadian Division on the Beveland isthmus to the defense of Bergen op Zoom. By October 24, Allied lines were pushed out further from the neck of the peninsula, ensuring German counterattacks would not cut off the 2nd Canadian Division, by then moving west along it towards Walcheren island. On October 26, 1944, Field Marshal von Rundstedt ordered to \\"forestall an enemy breakthrough and economize with our strength, I hereby authorize Fifteenth Army to withdraw to the general line Bergen op Zoom/Roosendaal/Breda/Dongen/west of 's-Hertogenbosch\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 50 The 4th Canadian Armoured Division moved north from the Leopold Canal and took Bergen op Zoom. The South Alberta Regiment and The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, which liberated Bergen op Zoom, reported \\"the reception of the people of Bergen Op Zoom was as enthusiastic and wild as any yet seen\\". Dempsey had been ordered by Montgomery to use the 12th Corps to cut off the retreat of the German 15th Army.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 130. The 1st Polish Division had been assigned a defensive role and was joined on 23 October by the U.S. 104th \\"Timberwolf\\" Division commanded by General Terry Allen.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 131. Model argued that recently arrived 47th Panzer corps of two divisions making up 24,000 men and 40 tanks go on the offensive to distract the Allies, a request Rundstedt approved. On 27 October, the Germans attacked the U.S. 7th Armored Division, which was holding the flanks for the Canadians with much success, advancing 6 miles. Through Rundstedt believed that Model's offensive had achieved nothing and ordered his men back, in fact Model's \\"spoiling attack\\" had caused the British 15th Infantry Division to be pulled out of Tilburg to reinforce the 7th Division, slowing Dempsey's advance. As the Germans had attacked, the American Timberwolf Division went on the offensive on 27 October with the aim of taking Zundert. The disjointed attacks which Montgomery ordered with the 1st Polish Division and 104th heading towards Breda allowed the German 15th Army to escape once again. On 29 October, the 4th Canadian Armored Division went on the offensive, with the Algonquin Regiment trying to encircle German position at Steenbergen just north of Bergen Op Zoom while the Governor-General's Foot Guards heading towards Steenbergen. The elite German 6th Parachute Regiment put stiff resistance, using panzerfausts (bazookas) and SP guns to knock out the Canadian tanks, but withdrew into Steenbergen when the Foot Guards threatened to cut off their line of retreat. The war diary of the Canadian 4th Armored Division sarcastically described the 6th Parachute Regiment as \\"...under the command of Lt. Col von der Heydt and are of a better quality than most of the master race we have so far encountered. They worship their leader who is reported to have knocked out four of our tanks with a German bazooka...\\". On 31 October, the Algonquin Regiment and the Grenadier Guards attacked the village of Welberg just outside of Steenbergen, which was so fiercely defended by the 6th Parachute Regiment that ultimately the almost entire 4th Division had to be committed to take Welberg over three days of fighting. On 7 November, Rundstedt, having pulled out most of the 15th Army, ordered German forces to move north of the Maas River in order to form a stronger defensive line. =Operation Switchback= The second main operation, Operation Switchback, opened with fierce fighting to reduce the Breskens Pocket. Here, the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division encountered tenacious German resistance as it fought to cross the Leopold Canal.In the Shadow of Arnhem - Ken Tout - 2003 (Paperback 2009, ) An earlier failed attempt by the Canadian 4th Armoured Division at Moerbrugge had demonstrated the challenge they faced. In addition to the formidable German defences on both the Leopold Canal and the Schipdonk Canal, much of the approach area was flooded. The Breskens pocket was held by the 64th Division commanded by General Knut Eberding, an infantryman with extensive experience on the Eastern Front who was regarded as an expert in defensive warfare.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 78. When the 15th Army had retreated from the Pas de Calais region of France across the Low Countries in September 1944, an enormous number of guns and ammunition ended up in the Breskens Pocket, including one hundred 20 mm anti-aircraft guns. They were used by the Wehrmacht as a sort of \\"super-heavy machine gun\\" and were much dreaded by the Canadian infantry. 20-mm guns could shred a man to pieces within seconds. Besides the 20-mm guns, the 64th Division had 23 of the famous 88 mm flak guns, known for their power to destroy an Allied tank with a single direct hit, together with 455 light machine guns and 97 mortars. While Montgomery focused on Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Eberding used three weeks of quiet to have his men dig in. He later expressed amazement about the Allied air forces hardly ever bombing the Breskens Pocket in September, allowing his men to build defensive works with barely an effort to stop them. The flat, swampy polder country made the Breskens Pocket into an \\"island\\", as much of the ground was impassable with only a few \\"land bridges\\" connecting the area to the mainland. The Wehrmacht had blown up dykes to flood much of the ground so that the Canadians could only advance along the raised country roads. Eberding reported that the polder country was \\"a maze of ditches, canalized rivers and commercial canals, often above the level of the surrounding countryside...which made military maneuver almost impossible except on the narrow roads built on top of the dykes. Each of these roadways were carefully registered for both artillery and mortar fire\\". It was decided that the best place for an assault would be immediately east of where the two canals divided: a narrow strip of dry ground, only a few hundred metres wide at its base beyond the Leopold Canal (described as a long triangle with its base on the Maldegem-Aardenburg road and its apex near the village of Moershoofd some east). Despite the fact that the Ultra intelligence provided by Bletchley Park had revealed that the 64th Division was digging in for a hard fight and that Eberding had ordered a fight to the death, Canadian military intelligence seriously underestimated the size of the German forces. They expected Eberding to retreat to Walcheren island once the 3rd Canadian division started to advance.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 79. However, Simonds appreciated the problems imposed by the polder country and the Germans concentrating their forces at the few \\"land bridges\\". He planned to use amphibious vehicles known as \\"Buffalos\\" to travel across the flooded countryside to outflank the German forces. Simonds planned to strike both at the Leopold canal and at the rear of the Breskens Pocket via an amphibious landing at the Braakman inlet. A two- pronged assault commenced. The Canadian 3rd Division's 7th Brigade made the initial assault across the Leopold Canal, while the 9th Brigade mounted the amphibious attack from the northern (coastal) side of the pocket. The 7th Brigade was known as the \\"Western Brigade\\" in the Canadian Army as its three regiments were all from western Canada with the Canadian Scottish Regiment coming from Victoria area, the Regina Rifles from the Regina area, and the Royal Winnipeg Rifles from the Winnipeg area, while the 9th Brigade was known as the \\"Highland brigade\\" as its three regiments were all Highland regiments with two coming from Ontario and another from Nova Scotia. The North Shore Regiment made a diversionary attack across the Leopold Canal, while the Regina Rifles regiment and the Canadian Scottish Regiment made the main assault. The Royal Montreal Regiment, which had never seen action yet, were pressing to get into the fight, and as such, the B company of the Regina Rifles, nicknamed the \\"Johns\\", agreed to step aside so one company of the Royal Montreal Regiment could take their place.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 82-83. A Canadian field hospital on a Walcheran Dyke The 9th Highland Brigade, however, was unable to land at the same time as expected, owing to their unfamiliarity with amphibious vehicles.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 80. The assault began on October 6, supported by extensive artillery and Canadian-built Wasp Universal Carriers, equipped with flamethrowers. The 7th Brigade was supposed to be on their own for 40 hours, but instead faced 68 hours of the Germans using everything they had to try the stop the Canadians from crossing the Leopold canal.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 82. Simonds had planned to take the Wehrmacht by surprise by avoiding a preliminary bombardment and instead having the Wasps incinerate the German defenders with a \\"barrage of flame\\". The Wasps launched their barrage of flames across the Leopold Canal, allowing the 7th Brigade troops to scramble up over the steep banks and launch their assault boats. However, the Germans had dug in well and many escaped the flamethrowers. One company of the Royal Montreal Regiment was almost destroyed on the edge of the Leopold canal. The Germans brought down heavy machine gun and mortar fire and only a few of the Montrealers made it to the other side.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 83 The A company of the Regina Rifles did not attempt to cross the canal because the volume of machine gun fire convinced the experienced \\"Johns\\" that it was too dangerous to try to cross the canal in daylight.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 83. The Royal Montreal Regiment company held their precious \\"bridgehead\\" for several hours before being joined by the \\"Johns\\" three hours later when D company of the Regina Rifles crossed the canal. They were joined by C and A companies in the evening. By that time, most of the men of B company of the Royal Montreal Regiment, who had been anxious to get into action, were dead. By contrast, the \\"barrage of flame\\" worked as expected for the Canadian Scottish Regiment, who were able to cross the Leopold canal without much opposition and put up a kapok footbridge within the first hour of crossing the canal. Two precarious, separate footholds were established, but the enemy recovered from the shock of the flamethrowers and counter-attacked, though the Germans were unable to move the Canadians from their vulnerable bridgeheads. Brigadier J.C. Spraggree became worried that the Regina Rifles might be destroyed by the Germans' ferocious defense, leading him to order his reserve, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, to cross over the Canadian Scottish Regiment's bridgehead and link up with the Regina Rifles. The polderland, which limited avenues of advance, proved to be a major difficulty as the Germans concentrated their fire along the few raised roads. At the same time, the Regina Rifles came under heavy counterattacks and were barely hanging on. Canadian losses were so heavy that a squadron of tankmen from the 17th Hussars Regiment were given rifles and sent to fight as infantrymen. The Canadian historians' Terry Copp and Robert Vogel wrote the fighting \\"...was at close quarter and of such ferocity that veterans insist that it was worse than the blackest days of Normandy\\". The war diary of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles reported: \\"Heavy casualties were suffered by both sides and the ground was littered with both German and Royal Winnipeg Rifle dead\\". The war diary of the Canadian Scottish regiment sardonically noted: \\"The grim fighting was such that Piats and Bazookas were used to blow down walls of houses where resistance was worst. These anti-tank weapons are quite handy little house- breakers!\\"Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 90. By October 9, the gap between the bridgeheads was closed, and by early morning on October 12 a position had been gained across the Aardenburg road. October 10, 11, and 12 were days of intense struggle while the men of the 7th Brigade with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles took, lost and then retook a group of houses known as Graaf Jan and the Regina Rifles found themselves pinned down by a group of well dug-in pillboxes that seemed to be resilient to artillery.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 88. The Germans had ample artillery, together with an immense number of artillery shells, and brought down heavy fire on any Canadian advance.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 84. Making the fighting even more difficult was the heavy rain that started the day after the crossing of the Leopold canal, with a post-operation report on Operation Switchback stating: \\"In places the bridgehead was little bigger than the northern canal bank. Even protection was slight: slit trenches rapidly filled with water and had to be dug out many times a day\\". The Canadians could not advance beyond their bridgehead on the Leopold canal, but Eberding, not content with stopping the Canadians, decided to \\"annihilate\\" the 7th Brigade by launching a series of counter-attacks that cost the German 64th Division dearly, as Canadian artillerymen were killing German infantrymen as proficiently as German artillerymen were killing Canadians. Simonds' plan failed when the 9th Brigade did not land at the same time as the 7th Brigade crossed the Leopold Canal and the 64th Division decisively stopped the advance of the 7th Brigade. In the end, only Eberding's determination to wipe out the 7th Brigade allowed Simonds' plan to work. In terms of numbers lost as a percentage of those engaged, the battle of the Leopold Canal was one of the bloodiest battles for Canada in World War II, with 533 killed and another 70 men breaking down due to battle exhaustion. Copp and Vogel wrote: \\"One in every two men who crossed the Leopold became a casualty!\\" The men who broke down under battle curled up in a fetal position and refused to move, speak, eat or drink as their spirits had been broken by the stress of the fighting. On 14 October 1944, Eberding, a man deeply committed to National Socialism, ordered that German soldiers who retreated without orders were to be regarded as deserters and summarily executed, and \\"...where the names of deserters are ascertained their names will be made known to the civilian population at home and their next of kin will be looked upon as enemies of the German people\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 102. The Canadian 9th Brigade conducted an amphibious operation with the aid of Terrapin (the first use of the vehicle in Europe) and Buffalo amphibious vehicles, crewed by the British 5th Assault Regiment of the Royal Engineers.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 92. The brigade planned to cross the mouth of the Braakman Inlet in these vehicles and to land in the vicinity of Hoofdplaat, a tiny hamlet in the rear or coastal side of the pocket, thus exerting pressure from two directions at once. An \\"after action\\" report described the scene on the Terneuzen Canal: \\"As darkness fell only tail lights showed. The locks at Sas Van Gent proved difficult to negotiate, for the Buffaloes were not easily steered when moving slowly. Their aeroplane engines created a sound so like the roar of aircraft that over Flushing the anti-aircraft guns fired sporadically...Because of the damage to the locks near the ferry (at Neuzen) it was necessary to cut ramps in the bank and by-pass the obstacle. Not only was this a slow progress, but many craft were damaged. The decision was therefore taken to postpone the operation for 24 hours\\". The delay allowed for Admiral Ramsay to volunteer the services of Lieutenant-Commander R.D. Franks of the Royal Navy to serve as a pilot, guiding the Buffaloes expertly down the river Scheldt without the Germans noticing. Franks reported: \\"It was nearly ideal night, calm and quiet with a half moon behind a light cloud, but a bit of haze which restricted visibility to a mile at most. We were quite invisible from the north shore of the Scheldt, where all was quiet...Our touchdown was planned to be on either side of a groyne...we were able to identify it and then lie off flicking our lamps to guide the LVT's in. They deployed and thundered past us...I could see through my binoculars the infantry disembark on dry land and move off\\". In spite of difficulties in maneuvering vehicles through the canals and the resulting 24-hour delay, the Germans were taken by surprise and a bridgehead was established. The North Nova Scotia Highland regiment landed with no resistance and woke nine sleeping German soldiers at their dug-out, taking them prisoner. The Highland Light Infantry regiment's major problem at the landing site was not the Wehrmacht, but mud. After the initial landing, the Cameron Highlanders and the Stormont, Dundas and Glengary Highlanders were landed by Franks. Once again, the Germans recovered quickly and counter-attacked with ferocity; however, they were slowly forced back. Upon hearing of the landing at the Braakman Inlet, Field Marshal Model reacted promptly, telling Hitler: \\"Today, the enemy launched a decision-seeking attack on the Breskens bridgehead\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 94. Living up to his reputation as the \\"F√ºhrer's Fireman\\", Model ordered Eberding to immediately \\"annihilate\\" the Highland Brigade. Starting on daybreak on October 10, the Highland Brigade came under counter-attack, with the Stormont, Dundas and Glengary Highland regiment, known as the \\"Glens\\" in the Canadian Army, spending two days fighting for the village of Hoofdplaat with a loss of 17 dead and 44 wounded. The North Nova Scotia Highlanders took three days to take the village of Driewegen, with the regimental war diary reporting: \\"The artillery is kept busy and this dyke to dyke fighting is very different to what we have been doing. It appears the enemy are a much better type than we have been running into lately\\". The Canadian Army was known for the quality of its artillery, which took a heavy toll on the German counter-attacks by day, with the war diary of 15th Field Regiment for 12 October reading: \\"Today we were the busiest we have been since Cormelles and Falaise pocket days\\". The Germans' nightly attacks enjoyed more success, with the Highland Light Infantry losing and then retaking the village of Biervliet during a confusing night battle. Canadian Major-General Daniel Spry of the 3rd Division changed the original plan to commit the 8th Brigade in support of the 7th Brigade, and instead sent the 8th Brigade to link up with the 4th Division and then come to the support of the 9th Brigade.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 94-96. Map of the Breskens Pocket The Canadian 10th Brigade of the 4th Armoured Division crossed the Leopold Canal and advanced at Isabella Polder. Then the 3rd Division's 8th Brigade was called to move south from the coastal side of the pocket. This opened up a land-based supply route into the pocket. Eberding used his reserves in his counter-attacks and reported to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that some units of the 64th Division had \\"been reduced to one third\\". Between October 10 and 15, the 64th Division staged a \\"fighting retreat\\", as Eberding called it, to new pocket designed to shorten his lines, since so many of his units were now under-strength. The Canadian Scottish Regiment found the village of Eede empty and abandoned, entered the village and promptly came under heavy artillery bombardment. The Queen's Own Rifles regiment, leading the advance of the 8th Brigade, found the village of IJzendijke \\"well defended\\" on October 15, but abandoned the next day. The Highland Light Infantry and the \\"Glens\\" broke through the main German line, but General Spry, unaware of this, ordered a withdrawal, in order to concentrate greater forces.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 102=1-3. The German officers explained away their retreat by claiming they were being overwhelmed by tanks, but in fact there were only four, belonging to the British Columbia Regiment, operating north of the Leopold canal.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 104 The presumed tanks were actually the M10 self-propelled anti-tank guns of the 3rd Canadian Anti-Tank Regiment which provided fire support to the Canadian infantry. Joining the Canadians on October 20 were the 157th Highland Light Infantry Brigade of the 52nd Division, which allowed Spry to group the three brigades of the 3rd Division for the final push.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 104. From the summer of 1944 the Canadian Army experienced a major shortage of infantrymen, owing to policies of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie-King. In order to defeat Maurice Duplessis, the Union Nationale premier of Quebec who called a snap election in 1939 to seek a mandate to oppose the war, Mackenzie-King had promised that only volunteers would be sent to fight overseas and that there would be no overseas conscription. With only so many Canadians willing to volunteer, especially as infantry, the Canadian Army ran seriously short of infantrymen, as their losses were not compensated by replacements.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 106. In planning the final push, Spry favored a cautious, methodical approach, emphasizing firepower that was designed to save as many of the lives of his men as possible.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 104=106. The 3rd Division fought additional actions to clear German troops from the towns of Breskens, Oostburg, Zuidzande, and Cadzand, as well as the coastal fortress Fort Frederik Hendrik. When advancing, the Canadians proceeded very slowly and used massive firepower via air strikes and artillery bombardments when faced with opposition. The shortage of infantry replacements meant that Canadian officers were loath to engage in operations that might lead to heavy losses. On October 24, Field Marshal Montgomery arrived at the headquarters of the 3rd Division. Despite the fact that Montgomery had chosen to fight the Battle of Arnhem instead of clearing the Scheldt in September 1944, thus having allowed the Germans to dig in, he criticized the 3rd Canadian Division for its slow advance, saying the Breskens Pocket should have been cleared weeks ago and calling the Canadian officers cowards for their unwillingness to take heavy losses. As a result, the 157th Brigade was withdrawn as a punishment and the 3rd Division was ordered to press on with \\"all speed\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 106-108. Despite the fact that the Canadians could not afford heavy losses, the 3rd Division began a period of \\"intense combat\\" to clear out the Breskens Pocket.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 108. The R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re attacked the town of Oostburg on October 24, losing an entire company, but since they had been ordered to take Oostburg at \\"any price\\", the \\"Chads\\" dug in to hold their ground while the Queen's Own Rifles came to their aid. On October 25, the Queen's Own Rifles took Oostburg after what its war diary called \\"a wild bayonet charge\\" amid \\"fairly heavy\\" casualties. Lieutenant Boos of the A company of the Queen's Own Rifles was awarded the Military Cross for leading what should have been a suicidal bayonet charge on the Oostburg town gates but ended with him and his men taking the gates. Despite tenacious German opposition, inspired at least in part by Eberding's policy of executing soldiers who retreated without orders, the Canadians pushed the Germans back steadily.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 110. In the last days of the battle, German morale declined and the number of executions of \\"deserters\\" increased as many German soldiers wished to surrender rather than die in what was clearly a lost battle. The R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re, which could ill-afford the losses, seized a bridgehead on the Afleidingskanaal van de Lije (Derivation Canal of the Lys), over which the engineers built a bridge. On November 1, the North Nova Scotia Highlanders stormed a pillbox and captured Eberding, who, despite his own orders to fight to the death for the F√ºhrer, surrendered without firing a shot.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 111. After being taken prisoner, Eberding met Spry and accused him of not being aggressive enough in taking advantage of \\"opportunities\\", saying any German general would have moved far more swiftly. Spry responded that having lost about 700 men killed in two \\"aggressive\\" operations within five days, he preferred a methodical advance that preserved the lives of his men.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 96. Eberding replied that this showed \\"weakness\\" on the side of the Canadians, noting that Wehrmacht generals were only concerned with winning and never let concern with casualties interfere with the pursuit of victory. Operation Switchback ended on November 3, when the Canadian 1st Army liberated the Belgian towns of Knokke and Zeebrugge, officially closing the Breskens Pocket and eliminating all German forces south of the Scheldt.Montgomery also bestowed the nickname \\"Water Rats\\" on the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, a play on the Desert Rats title the 7th Armoured Division had earned in the Western Desert. General Harry Crerar reportedly hated the term, though it was meant as a tribute to their success in amphibious operations in Normandy and the Scheldt. (Granatstein, Jack. The Generals: Canadian Senior Commanders in the Second World War.) =Operation Vitality= C15TA trucks move towards South Beveland during the Battle of the Scheldt On the afternoon of October 22, Major- General Foulkes, as acting commander of the 2nd Canadian Corps told the 2nd Canadian Division that the start of Operation Vitality, the operation to take the South Beveland peninsula, had been pushed forward by two days by the \\"express orders from Field Marshal Montgomery who had placed this operation at first priority for the British and Canadian forces in this area\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 57-58. Major Ross Ellis of The Calgary Highlanders told Foulkes that the men were tired after the hard fighting earlier in October, only to be informed that the operation would go through.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 58. Morale in the 2nd Division was poor, with only the Royal Regiment of Canada, the Essex Scottish Regiment, the Cameron Highland Regiment and the Calgary Highlanders being anything close to assembling four rifle companies. The attack was to be led by the 6th Brigade consisting of the Cameron Highlanders, the battered South Saskatchewan Regiment and the even more battered Fusiliers Mont-Royal, who despite being very under-strength were assigned to lead the attack on the centre. This third major operation opened on October 24, when the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance down the South Beveland peninsula. The Canadians hoped to advance rapidly, bypassing opposition and seizing bridgeheads over the Kanaal door Zuid-Beveland (Canal through South Beveland), but they too were slowed by mines, mud and strong enemy defenses. The war diary of the Fusiliers Mont-Royal reports simply that the regiment had taken \\"heavy casualties\\", the Cameron Highlanders reported \\"stiff opposition\\" from the 6th Parachute Regiment of the Luftwaffe, while the South Saskatchewan Regiment reported: \\"The county over which we had come was not the kind you dream about to make an attack in as it was partly wooded, partly open, and it had many buildings, ditches, etc\\". Joining the 6th Brigade later that day were the 5th Brigade, with the Calgary Highlanders leading the assault and reporting the \\"remnants\\" of two platoons that had advanced beyond the dyke to be joined by the Black Watch when night fell. The Royal Regiment had seized its start-line during the night and in the early morning was joined by the Essex Scottish Regiment and the Fort Garry Horse Regiment to make a slow advance supported by heavy artillery fire.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 58-59. On October 25, the Essex Scottish Regiment reported that 120 Germans had surrendered and that the \\"tough shell of defences at the narrowest point of the peninsula was broken\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 59. On October 26, the 70th Infantry Division's commander General Wilhelm Daser reported to Rundstedt that the situation was untenable, and that retreat was unavoidable. An amphibious attack was made across the Western Scheldt by the British 52nd (Lowland) Division to get in behind the German's Canal through South Beveland defensive positions. The 156th West Scottish Brigade described the Dutch countryside as \\"extremely difficult\\", but also noted that German morale was poor, stating that they had expected the Wehrmacht to fight harder and that most of their casualties were coming from mines and booby-traps. With the formidable German defence outflanked, the Canadian 6th Infantry Brigade began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road. With the canal line gone, the German defense crumbled and South Beveland was cleared. The third phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was now complete. Daser ordered his men to retreat and make a stand on \\"Fortress Walcheren\\". =Operation Infatuate= Map of troops at Walcheren Island As the fourth phase of the battle opened, only the island of Walcheren at the mouth of the Scheldt remained in German hands. The island's defenses were extremely strong: heavy coastal batteries on the western and southern coasts defended both the island and the western Scheldt estuary, and the coastline had been strongly fortified against amphibious assaults. Furthermore, a landward-facing defensive perimeter had been built around the town of Flushing (Dutch: Vlissingen) to defend its port facilities, should an Allied landing on Walcheren succeed. The only land approach was the Sloedam, a long, narrow causeway from South Beveland, little more than a raised two-lane road. To complicate matters, the flats that surrounded this causeway were too saturated with sea water for movement on foot, but had too little water for an assault in storm boats.  Inundation of Walcheren  To hamper German defense, Walcheren island's dykes were breached by attacks from RAF Bomber Command. Due to the high risks for the local population, the bombings were sanctioned at the highest level and preceded by leafleting to warn the island's inhabitants. The first bombing was on October 3 at Westkapelle, on the western shore of the island. The Westkapelle dyke was attacked by 240 heavy bombers, resulting in a large gap that allowed the seawater to enter. This flooded the central part of the island, allowing the use of amphibious vehicles and forcing the German defenders onto the high ground surrounding the island and in the towns. The bombing at Westkapelle came with severe loss of life, with 180 civilian deaths resulting from the bombardment and the resulting flooding. Attacks on other dykes had to ensure that the flooding could not be contained. On October 7, dykes in the south were bombed, west and east of Flushing. Finally, on October 11, northern dykes at Veere became a target. Bombing against the island defenses was hampered by bad weather and requirements for attacks on Germany. The island was then attacked from three directions: across the Sloedam causeway from the east, across the Scheldt from the south, and by sea from the west.  Battle of Walcheren Causeway  Royal Marines wade ashore near Vlissingen to complete the occupation of Walcheren on November 1, 1944. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the Sloedam causeway on October 31. Post-war controversy exists around the claim that there was a \\"race\\" within the 2nd Division for the first regiment to take the causeway to Walcheren island, implying that the failure to take the causeway on October 31 was due to reckless determination to win the \\"race\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 68. Colonel C.P. Stacey wrote about the \\"race\\" in the official history of the Canadian Army, a charge that was vehemently disputed by Copp and Vogel in the Maple Leaf Route. The 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division had advanced rapidly up to the causeway, which led to Brigadier Keefler giving orders to take the causeway while the task of taking the Beveland end of the causeway had been given to the 52nd Division.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 68-69. The Royal Regiment took the eastern end of the causeway in a night attack.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 70. As there seemed an actual chance of taking the entire causeway, orders were sent to the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division to launch an attack, to be led by the \\"jinxed\\" Black Watch who were to advance down the causeway while the Calgary Highlanders and Le R√©giment de Maisonneuve were to advance by boat. An initial attack by the Black Watch was rebuffed while it discovered the waters in the channel were too shallow for the 2nd Division to cross it, leaving a company of the Black Watch stranded on the causeway under heavy German attack. The Calgary Highlanders then sent a company over which was also stopped halfway across the causeway. During a second attack on the morning of November 1, the Highlanders managed to gain a precarious foothold. A day of fighting followed and then the Highlanders were relieved by the R√©giment de Maisonneuve, who struggled to maintain the bridgehead. The R√©giment de Maisonneuve finally did secure the bridgehead, only to find that it was useless for an advance, since the German defenses in the polderland were too entrenched for an advance to be made.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 221. General Foulkes ordered Major-General Hakewill-Smith to launch the 52nd Division into a frontal attack on Walcheren, which Hakewill-Smith protested strongly.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 70-72. The \\"Maisies\\" withdrew onto the Causeway on November 2, to be relieved by the 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders of the 52nd Division. Instead of launching a frontal attack as ordered by Foulkes, Hakewill-Smith outflanked the Germans by landing the Cameronian regiment at the village of Nieuwdorp, two miles south of the causeway, and linked up with the Glasgow Highlanders the next day.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 72. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.Copp, Terry. The Brigade: The 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade in the Second World War The battle for the causeway had caused the 2nd Division 135 dead in what has become of the most controversial operations of the 2nd Division, with much criticism centering on the decisions of Foulkes. Despite the fact that Lieutenant-General Simonds and Foulkes were both British immigrants to Canada, the two detested one another and Simonds often spoke of his wish to sack Foulkes, believing him to be incompetent. Because of port shortage, Captain Pugsley of the Royal Navy had to improvise heavily to provide the necessary shipping for the landings on Walcheren island.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 124. Despite the refusal of Bomber Command to strike various German fortifications on Walcheren, opening up the Scheldt was regarded as so important that during a meeting on October 31 between Simonds, Foulkes, and Admiral Ramsay, it was decided that the landings on Walcheren were to go ahead. Captain Pugsley, aboard the command ship HMS Kingsmill, was given the final decision, with orders to cancel the operation if he thought it was too risky. At the same time, Simonds ordered two Canadian artillery regiments to concentrate 300 guns on the mainland, to provide fire support for the landings. The amphibious landings were conducted in two parts on November 1.  Operation Infatuate I  Operation Infatuate I consisted mainly of infantry of the 155th Infantry Brigade (4th and 5th battalions King's Own Scottish Borderers, 7th/9th battalion, Royal Scots) and No. 4 Commando, who were ferried across from Breskens in small landing craft to an assault beach in the south-eastern area of Flushing, codenamed \\"Uncle\\" Beach. With the Canadian artillery opening fire, the 4th Commando were carried ashore in twenty Landing Craft Assaults, to be followed by the King's Own Scottish Borderers regiment who attacked Flushing. During the next few days, they engaged in heavy street fighting against the German defenders, destroying much of Flushing. The Hotel Britannia, which before the war had catered to British tourists, was the headquarters of the German 1019th Regiment holding Flushing and became the scene of \\"spectacular fighting\\" described as \\"worthy of an action film\\" when the Royal Scots regiment engaged to take the hotel, which finally fell after three days.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 124-126. German prisoners being marched off on Walcheren  Operation Infatuate II  Operation Infatuate II was the amphibious landing at Westkapelle, also conducted on the morning of November 1. To cross the shallow water required a daylight assault with fire support provided by the Support Squadron Eastern Flank (SSEF) commanded by Commander K.A Sellar, with additional support from the battleship HMS Warspite and two monitors, HMS Erebus and HMS Roberts.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 126. Air support was limited due to weather conditions. With no air support, no spotter aircraft to guide the guns of his ships, and the Germans fully alerted with their coastal artillery already firing at the British ships, Captain Pugsley was faced with the difficult decision to cancel or proceed, and after some deliberation, sent out the message reading \\"Nelson\\", which was the code name to land. The radar- guided guns of the German coastal artillery took a heavy toll on the SSEF, which lost 9 ships sunk and another 11 that were so badly damaged that they had to be broken up for scrap as they were beyond repair. After a heavy bombardment by the Royal Navy (a battleship and two monitors, plus a support squadron of landing craft carrying guns), troops of 4th Special Service Brigade (Nos. 41, 47, and 48 Royal Marines Commando and No. 10 Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of Belgian and Norwegian troops) supported by the specialized armoured vehicles (amphibious transports, mine-clearing tanks, bulldozers, etc.) of the 79th Armoured Division were landed on both sides of the gap in the sea dyke, using large landing craft as well as amphibious vehicles to bring men and tanks ashore. The Royal Marines took Westkapelle and Domburg the next day.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 126-127. Anticipating the fall of \\"Fortress Walcheren\\", on November 4, Admiral Ramsay ordered that mine-sweepers start the work of removing the German mines from the river Scheldt, a task that was not completed until 28 November.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 127. Heavy fighting ensued in Domburg as well before the ruins of the town were captured.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 127. On 3 November, the Royal Marines had linked with the 52nd Division. Part of the troops moved south-east toward Flushing, while the main force went north-east to clear the northern half of Walcheren (in both cases along the high-lying dune areas, as the center of the island was flooded) and link up with the Canadian troops who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by some of the German troops defending this area, so that fighting continued until November 7. On November 6, the island capital Middelburg fell after a calculated gamble on the Allies' part when the Royal Scots attacked Middelburg with a force of Buffaloes from the rear. Since Middelburg was impossible to reach with tanks, due to the inundations, a force of amphibious Landing Vehicle Tracked (\\"Buffaloes\\") were driven into the town, forcing an end to all German resistance on November 8. General Daser portrayed the Buffaloes as tanks, giving him an excuse to surrender as he was faced with an overwhelming force. Meanwhile, the Canadian 4th Armoured Division had pushed eastward past Bergen- op-Zoom to Sint Philipsland where it sank several German vessels in Zijpe harbor. With the approach to Antwerp clear, the fourth phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was complete. Between 20 and 28 November, Royal Navy minesweepers were brought in to clear the Scheldt estuary of naval mines and other underwater obstacles left by the Germans. On November 28, after much-needed repairs of the port facilities, the first convoy entered Antwerp, led by the Canadian-built freighter Fort Cataraqui. Aftermath Fort Cataraqui unloads oil at the harbour of Antwerp At the end of the five-week offensive, the Canadian First Army had taken 41,043 German prisoners. Complicated by the waterlogged terrain, the Battle of the Scheldt proved to be a challenging campaign in which significant losses were suffered by the Canadians.At the end of the five-week offensive, the victorious First Canadian Army had taken 41,043 prisoners, but suffered 12,873 casualties (killed, wounded, or missing), 6,367 of whom were Canadians. Throughout the Battle of the Scheldt, battle exhaustion was a major problem for the Canadians.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 116. The 3rd Canadian Division had landed on D-Day on 6 June 1944 and had been fighting more or less continuously since. During the Normandy campaign, the 3rd Canadian Division had taken the heaviest losses of all the divisions in the 21st Army Group, with the 2nd Canadian Division taking the second-heaviest losses.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 216. A psychiatric report from October 1944 stated that 90% of battle exhaustion cases were men who been in action for three months or longer. Men suffering from battle exhaustion would go catatonic and curl up in fetal position, but the report found that after a week of rest, most men would recover enough to speak and move about. According to the report, the principal cause of battle exhaustion \\"seemed to be futility. The men claimed there was nothing to which to look forward to ‚Äì no rest, no leave, no enjoyment, no normal life and no escape....The second most prominent cause...seemed to be the insecurity in battle because the condition of the battlefield did not allow for average cover. The third was the fact that they were seeing too much continual death and destruction, loss of friends, etc\\". The Canadian government policy of sending only volunteers overseas had caused major shortages of men, especially in the infantry regiments. Canadian units were too under-strength to allow leave, where U.S. and British units could. This stretched the soldiers tremendously.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 pages 116-117. A common complaint of soldiers suffering from battle exhaustion was that the Army was to trying to \\"get blood from a stone\\", with the under-strength units being pushed relentlessly to keep fighting, without replacements for their losses and no chance to rest. After the battle, the II Canadian Corps moved to the Nijmegen sector to take over from the 30 British Corps.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 134. Although Antwerp was opened to Allied shipping on 28 November, the German 15th Army had delayed the use of Antwerp to the Allies from 4 September to 28 November 1944, which was longer than what Hitler had hoped for, justifying the German decision to hold the river Scheldt. Even before the Battle of the Scheldt, the Canadian Army was aware that it lacked reinforcements to replace its losses, and the losses endured during the fighting help provoke the Conscription Crisis.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 138-139. The Canadian Defense Minister, Colonel John Ralston, was forced to report to the prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, that the current policy of only sending volunteers overseas was not sustainable as the losses in the Battle of the Scheldt vastly exceeded the number of volunteers, and conscripts would have to be sent overseas.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 139. Copp and Vogel strongly praised Simonds's leadership of the 1st Canadian Army, writing how his operations \\"were brilliantly planned and sometimes brilliantly executed\\".Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 137 Copp and Vogel also defended the Canadians from charges of incompetence and cowardice made by American and British historians stating: \\"The Canadian Army had, through October, the most difficult and important task of all the Allied armies, it had carried through a series of complex operations to a successful conclusion and it had done this with verve and skill despite the growing manpower shortage now apparent on all the Allied fronts.\\"Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 134 After the first ship reached Antwerp on November 28, convoys started bringing a steady stream of supplies to the continent, but this actually changed very little. Operation Queen continued to flounder while the Americans then suffered a major reverse in the Hurtgen forest offensive by December. The dismal fall weather hindered not only the Canadians in the Battle of Scheldt, but also the operations of 1st U.S Army in the Hurtgen forest, the 3rd U.S Army in Lorraine, and the 9th U.S. Army, the 7th U.S Army and 1st French Army further south.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 136. On 5 November 1944, Eisenhower calculated that for the offensives into the western borderlands of Germany to be successful, over the following month, it would require 6 million artillery shells, two million mortar shells, 400 more tanks, 1,500 jeeps, and 150,000 spare tires to replace worn-out ones, none of which was readily available until the Scheldt was cleared. By 15 December, only the 7th U.S. Army had reached the Rhine by taking Strasbourg while the U.S. Third Army had advanced into Germany to run up against one of the strongest sections of the West Wall. At least part of the reason for the failure for the Allied offensives was the shortage of infantry replacements with the Americans coming close to running out of infantry replacements while the British were forced to break up divisions to provide reinforcements. Germany recognized the danger of the Allies having a deep water port and in an attempt to destroy it ‚Äì or at least disrupt the flow of supplies ‚Äì the German military fired more V-2 rockets at Antwerp than at any other city. Nearly half of the V-2s launched during the war were aimed at Antwerp.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 127. The port of Antwerp was so strategically vital that during the Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front, launched on 16 December 1944, the primary German objective was to retake the city and its port.Copp, Terry & Vogel, Robert, Maple Leaf Route: Scheldt, Alma: Maple Leaf Route, 1985 page 137. Without Antwerp being opened, which allowed 2.5 million tons of supplies to arrive at that port between November 1944 and April 1945, the Allied advance into Germany in 1945 with the American, British, and French armies heading into the Reich would have been impossible. =Controversy= The Battle of the Scheldt has been described by historians as unnecessarily difficult, as it could have been cleared earlier and more easily had the Allies given it a higher priority than Operation Market Garden. American historian Charles B. MacDonald called the failure to immediately take the Scheldt \\"[o]ne of the greatest tactical mistakes of the war.\\"Charles B. MacDonald, The Mighty Endeavor; American Armed Forces in the European Theater in World War II, (New York, 1969) Because of the flawed strategic choices made by the Allies in early September 1944, the battle became one of the longest and bloodiest that the Canadian army faced over the course of the Second World War. The French Channel ports were \\"resolutely defended\\" like \\"fortresses\\" and Antwerp was the only viable alternative. However, Field Marshal Montgomery ignored Admiral Cunningham, who said that Antwerp would be \\"as much use as Timbuctoo\\" unless the approaches were cleared, and Admiral Ramsay, who warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the Germans could block the Scheldt estuary with ease. The Antwerp city and port fell in early September and were secured by XXX Corps under the command of Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks. Montgomery halted XXX Corps for resupply short of the wide Albert Canal to the north of the city, which consequently remained in enemy hands.Neillands. The Battle for the Rhine, p. 53. Horrocks regretted this after the war, believing that his corps might have advanced another with the fuel available.Horrocks. A Full Life, p. 205. Unknown to the Allies, at that time XXX Corps was opposed by only a single German division.Warner. Horrocks, p. 111. The pause allowed the Germans to regroup around the Scheldt River, and by the time the Allies resumed their advance, General Kurt Student's 1st Parachute Army had arrived and set up strong defensive positions along the opposite side of the Albert Canal and Scheldt river.Neillands. The Battle for the Rhine, p. 58. The task of breaking the strengthened German line, which stretched from Antwerp to the North Sea along the Scheldt River, would fall to the First Canadian Army in the month-long, costly Battle of the Scheldt.Neillands. The Battle for the Rhine, pp. 157‚Äì161. The Canadians \\"sustained 12,873 casualties in an operation which could have been achieved at little cost if tackled immediately after the capture of Antwerp. .... This delay was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.\\" The British historian Antony Beevor was of opinion that Montgomery, not Horrocks was to blame for not clearing the approaches, as Montgomery \\"was not interested in the estuary and thought that the Canadians could clear it later\\". Allied commanders were looking ahead to \\"leaping the Rhine...in virtually one bound.\\" Despite Eisenhower wanting the capture of one major port with its dock facilities intact, Montgomery insisted that the First Canadian Army should clear the German garrisons in Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk first, although these ports had all suffered demolitions and would not be navigable for some time. Boulogne (Operation Wellhit) and Calais (Operation Undergo) were captured on 22 and 29 September 1944; but Dunkirk was not captured until the end of the war on 9 May 1945 (see Siege of Dunkirk). When the Canadians eventually stopped their assaults on the northern French ports and started on the Scheldt approaches on 2 October, they found that German resistance was far stronger than they had imagined, as the remnants of the Fifteenth Army had had time to escape and reinforce the island of Walcheren and the South Beveland peninsula Winston Churchill claimed in a telegram to Jan Smuts on October 9 that \\"As regards Arnhem, I think you have got the position a little out of focus. The battle was a decided victory, but the leading division, asking, quite rightly, for more, was given a chop. I have not been afflicted with any feeling of disappointment over this and am glad our commanders are capable of running this kind of risk.\\" He said that the risks \\"...were justified by the great prize so nearly in our grasp\\" but acknowledged that \\"[c]learing the Scheldt Estuary and opening the port of Antwerp had been delayed for the sake of the Arnhem thrust. Thereafter it was given first priority.\\" Notes Footnotes References  Further reading   External links Canadians on the Scheldt Photos, battle information, video and more on the Canadian role in the battle. * Testaments of Honor, The Scheldt Official digital collection of experiences from World War II. * BBC, The Peoples War. * War Amps of Canada Against All Odds, a documentary by Cliff Chadderton * Liberation of the Netherlands at the online Canadian War Museum * The Calgary Highlanders Includes detailed history section with maps and descriptions of key battles such as Hoogerheide, The Coffin, and the storming of Walcheren Causeway. * Canadiansoldiers.com article on the battle, including maps and detailed information on German formations. * Petty Officer Basil Woolf Royal Navy and his account of LCH.269 and the Battle for Walcheren * The contribution of the Nr 2 Dutch Troop, Nr 10 Inter Allied Commando to Infatuate I and Infatuate II. * Memoirs of Joe Brown of Peebles (Battles at Flushing and Middelburg).

Born in Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1800, Mustafa Re≈üid entered public service at an early age and rose rapidly, becoming ambassador to France (1834) and to the United Kingdom (1836), minister for foreign affairs (1837), and once again ambassador to the United Kingdom (1838) and to France (1841). In the settlement of the Oriental Crisis of 1840, and during the Crimean War and the ensuing peace negotiations, he rendered important diplomatic services to the Ottoman state. He returned a third time as ambassador to France in 1843. Between 1845 and 1857, he held the office of Grand Vizier six times. One of the greatest and most versatile statesmen of his time, thoroughly acquainted with European politics and well-versed in national and international affairs, he was a convinced partisan for reform and the principal author of the legislative remodeling of the Ottoman administration known as Tanzimat. His efforts to promote reforms within the government led to the advancement of the careers of many other reformers, such as Fuad Pasha and Mehmed Emin √Çli Pasha.William L. Cleveland. \\"A History of the Modern Middle East\\", Westview Press, 2004, , p. 82. Early life Mustafa Re≈üid was born on 13 March 1800. His father, Mustafa Efendi, worked as a civil servant, but died when Mustafa Re≈üid was only ten. Mustafa had been attending a madrasa in hopes of becoming a religious leader.Waldner, 1623 However, when his father died, Re≈üid was forced to end his education in the madrassa in order to live with his uncle, Ispartalƒ± Ali Pasha, who at the time was a court chamberlain under Sultan Mahmud II. Re≈üid would then study at a scribal institution.Z√ºrcher, 484 When Ali Pasha was promoted to governor of Morea Eyalet in 1816, Re≈üid traveled with him. Early political life =Greek War of Independence= During the Greek War of Independence between 1820 and 1822, which occurred during his uncle's second term as governor of Morea and had the support of major European countries, Re≈üid acted as the seal carrier for the Grand Vizier and commander- in-chief, Seyyid Ali Pasha. During the war, Re≈üid noted for the first time several key points that would majorly influence his later political life. First, he noted that Ottoman institutions required major reform, especially needing a modernized army like that of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had led the Egyptian army in support of the Ottomans against the Greek rebels. Secondly, he realized that foreign European assistance and support was essential for the continuation of the empire. =In the office of the Foreign Minister= After being removed from his position, along with all the followers of Seyyid Ali Pasha following his rout and dismissal as commander-in-chief, Mustafa Re≈üid landed a job in the Ottoman Porte working as a clerk under the Foreign Minister. He quickly found the respect and praise of his superiors and rose up the ranks. During the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29), Re≈üid worked sending reports to Istanbul on the war. His good work during the war found him the attention of the Sultan, Mahmud II, who promoted Re≈üid into the Amedi Odasi, where he worked as the secretariat for incoming correspondence to the Porte. At the conclusion of the war, Mustafa Re≈üid was appointed as secretary to the Ottoman delegation to the Peace talks in Adrianople (Edirne) in 1829. During this time, he became a follower of Pertew Pasha, his superior in the office of incoming correspondence. Pertew Pasha held strong pro-British policies and relationship with the British ambassador Lord Ponsonby. Re≈üid, would also accompany Pertew during the negotiations in Egypt with the rebellious Muhammad Ali Pasha. Muhammad Ali took notice of Re≈üid's prowess as a diplomat and scribe and offered the young bureaucrat a superior position among the Egyptian administration, but Re≈üid denied the offer. By 1832, Re≈üid had been appointed to the position of amed√ßi, or Receiver, which was the head of the incoming correspondence secretariat. His familiarity with Egyptian affairs landed him the role of talking with Muhammad Ali's son, Ibrahim Pasha, after he routed Ottoman forces at Konya and reached K√ºtahya in western Anatolia by 1833.Somel, 263 However, Re≈üid faced backlash after appointing Ibrahaim Pasha as the tax collector for the district of Adana, along with making him governor of Damascus and Aleppo. Foreign interaction Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha in court uniform =Ambassador to Paris, 1834‚Äì1836= Mustafa Re≈üid was first sent to Paris in 1834 with the task of regaining Algeria from the recent French occupation. Although he ultimately failed, he would remain in Paris as a permanent ambassador until being transferred to London in 1836.Z√ºrcher, 485 =Ambassador to London, 1836‚Äì1838= Re≈üid transferred to the Ottoman Embassy in London where he created strong ties with the British Government, especially the London Diplomat Ponsonby who his Mentor, Pertew Pasha, had strong ties with as well. However, his major achievement during his stint as ambassador was gaining the support of the British Government for the Sultan against Muhammad Ali in Egypt. After being appointed Foreign Minister in 1838, as well as given the title of pasha, Re≈üid Pasha returned again to London in order to form a defensive alliance against the Muhammad Ali and his Egyptian forces. Although the talks materialized into nothing, on 16 August Re≈üid Pasha did manage to negotiate the Treaty of Balta Liman which was a commercial treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Britain. The treaty allowed for British goods within the Ottoman markets and also promised to end state monopolies within the Ottoman Empire. =Oriental Crisis of 1840= When Muhammad Ali moved to occupy Syria with his Egyptian army led by his son Ibrahim, then Grand Vizier of Egypt, H√ºsrev Pasha conceded not only Syria but also Egypt and Adana as well. Mustafa Re≈üid quickly realized the errors in H√ºsrev Pasha's actions, which would have led to the destruction of the Ottoman Empire and inevitable Russian domination, and gained the support of the British due to his strong ties from his previous ambassadorship. The French, who supported the Egyptians due to their desire to gain more influence in the region after the conquest of Algeria, went up against the other Great Powers: England, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, who supported the Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Re≈üid, now Foreign Minister, played a key role in the crisis. Throughout the crisis, Mustafa Re≈üid remained on the side of the Great Powers and consistently refused a direct settlement without the involvement of the Great Powers, much to the disappointment of Egypt and France. However, unbeknownst to the Great Powers, Mustafa Re≈üid, with approval from the Sultan, had drafted a settlement by the summer 1840 due to his impatience with the Great Powers' inability to reach an agreement.≈†ediv√Ω, 797 This secret settlement would grant Egypt to Muhammad Ali as a hereditary state along with the provinces of Acre, Saida, and Tripoli, a position that could be passed down to his sons and grandsons. The condition was that none of them could accumulate any more provinces, and after their deaths the provinces would return to Ottoman control.≈†ediv√Ω, 797‚Äì798 This plan was never put into place due to the London Convention of 1840, however. After the London Crisis, Mustafa Re≈üid received threats from the French embassy that if they were to ratify it, France would actively support the rebellious Egyptian Governor.≈†ediv√Ω, 839‚Äì841 Re≈üid ignored the threats and the Sublime Porte went on to sign the conference.≈†ediv√Ω, 841 After Muhammad Ali's refusal to sign the London Convention of 1840, all the Great Power diplomats met with Re≈üid Pasha in order to draft Ali Pasha's removal from office much to the dismay of their respective countries.≈†ediv√Ω, 842‚Äì846 After a swift military intervention that led to the defeat of Egyptian forces in Syria, Commodore Napier, leader of the allied forces, held a peace convention of his own with Muhammad Ali, which was met with great reprisal from Mustafa Re≈üid and the other diplomats.≈†ediv√Ω, 854 On 11 December 1840, Muhammad Ali Pasha finally submitted to the sultan and pledged his allegiance to the Sublime Porte.≈†ediv√Ω, 857 =Ambassador to Paris, 1841‚Äì1845= After the conclusion of the Oriental Crisis, Muhammad Ali Pasha bribed the Ottoman Porte to remove Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha from his post as Foreign Minister. He returned to his post as Ambassador to Paris soon after where he mainly focused his efforts on solving the Lebanon Question, which resulted from a dispute between a Christian group called the Maronites based out of Lebanon and an extremist Shia group called the Druzes who came from Syria and Lebanon.Celik, 423 =Crimean War= Escalation of crisis At the start of 1853, Mustafa Re≈üid held no political office. In 1852‚Äì53, tensions rose between Russia and France over the Holy Lands in Palestine. Russian diplomat Alexander Menshikov, who had been sent on special mission to Istanbul in 1853 to restore the privileges inside the Ottoman Empire that Russia had enjoyed for centuries, used Re≈üid Pasha, who he thought to be favorable to Christians due to the Rose Garden Edict of 1839 but was currently out of office, to talk with the Sultan. Yet, Menshikov failed to realize that Re≈üid Pasha had remained close with his British ties, especially Ambassador Stratford, and held anti-Russian beliefs. After the presentation of the Russian demands to the Sublime Porte on 5 May 1853 and the subsequent rejection of them on 10 May, Re≈üid, with the help of Ambassador Stratford as well as that of Menshikov, gained back his position of Foreign Minister. Re≈üid immediately tried stalling the Russian diplomat in order to ensure the support of his fellow ministers. After another five-day delay, on 15 May the Sublime Porte again rejected the Russian proposition which led to the evacuation of the Russian embassy and the end of Russian- Ottoman diplomacy on 21 May.Figes, 113‚Äì114 During this time, Re≈üid met one-on- one several times with while also writing to both Menshikov and Stratford. In Menshikov's writings, he described Re≈üid as being almost embarrassed to talk about the unanimous rejection of the Russian proposal and had also given the Russians a Turkish counter proposal, on which he seemed ashamed to present since he explained that he had no ability to revise them.Rich, 54‚Äì55 Also according to Menshikov, Re≈üid had clearly wanted to renew negotiations, but had been advised otherwise by Lord Stratford. Vienna Note In late July 1853, diplomats of the four major powers, France, Britain, Austria and Prussia met in Vienna and created their own solution to the Russian-Turkish crisis using a previous French proposal that had already been accepted by the Tsar.Rich, 73 The Vienna Note, as it was known, was accepted by the governments of all four of the neutral powers and by Russia, but was met with swift outcry in the Sublime Porte, led by Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha.Rich, 74 The Ottomans had already presented their own ultimatum, drafted by Re≈üid Pasha, to the Russian Ambassador Nesselrode which reached the Vienna Conference a day after the completion of their proposal. Re≈üid Pasha was furious that the British governments had gone behind their backs, and were now trying to force them to concede their sovereignty. He would also draft several amendments to the Vienna Note after begging for Stratford's support which stressed the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire against Russian advances, and only with these changes did he and several other Ottoman diplomats agree to the Vienna Note.Rich, 77 Russia, who had been waiting for Ottoman acceptance of the Vienna Note, rejected the Ottoman modifications, and peace seemed to be impossible.Curtiss, 162 Declaration of war On 26 September, following the Russian advances in the Balkans, the Sublime Porte held a two-day conference to determine a solution to the Russian problem, whether it be war or diplomacy. While many of the officials were favorable to war, Re≈üid Pasha cautioned them. He warned that the state was not prepared militarily to fight Russia in a war.Badem, 96 However, he also added that it was the Porte's decision even though the European Powers had advised them to refrain from waging war. He also remarked that the European powers are not against war but would need convincing to keep their forces in support of the Ottoman enterprise. When asked about the Christian subjects and their loyalty, Re≈üid responded that Christians, like Muslims had internal differences and would not support one another solely due to their religion. Although he originally seemed to have been against the war and for diplomacy, by the end of the meetings Re≈üid is quoted as saying, \\"It is better to die with arms in hand than to die with tied hands. God willing, we will be victorious and destroy the harmful treaties as well\\".Badem, 97 Stratford had even warned Re≈üid Pasha that England and France would not stand behind the Ottomans if they started the war.Wetzel, 92 However, it appears that Re≈üid's arguments had persuaded the other officials, and at the end of the conference, Re≈üid drafted a resolution for war which was sent to and accepted by the Sultan on 30 September and 4 October the Ottoman Empire officially declared War on Russia.Badem, 99 According to Certev Pasha, Re≈üid Pasha wrote this on the purpose of the Crimean War, \\"The unique objective of the Sublime Porte, the salutary aim that she entertains, is to come to the end of the war completely protected from any exterior anxiety, in order to busy herself solely with interior regulations to assure the well-well being of the empire by the perfecting of the progressive system of administration, by the just amelioration of the condition of all classes of the subjects, and by the development of her commerce and industry without any impediment; and as we have obviously just seen that the treaty of the year 1841 doesn‚Äôt suffice to give her security in the foreign quarter, the Sublime Porte believes it her duty to submit, as of now, to her allies, the necessity of making another treaty to serve as a complement to that one.\\" During the war Re≈üid Pasha immediately immersed himself in gaining European support. On 8 October 1853, only four days following the declaration of war, he petitioned the British and French Ambassadors for their support in the form of naval vessels in the straits of Dardanelles. On 20 October, the requests were fulfilled and both fleets were sailing to the straits. Two days prior, on 18 October, Re≈üid Pasha had sent orders for the Ottoman forces to commence fighting which began on 23 October. In December, following an Ottoman naval defeat at the bay of Sinop and rumors of Re≈üid Pasha's peace negotiations, students began revolting in the streets of Istanbul forcing Re≈üid and many of his followers to hide for their lives. Re≈üid submitted his resignation immediately but it was not accepted. Re≈üid Pasha's rivalry with one of his prior proteges, Mehmed Emin Ali, came to fruition during this time period as well. It is believed that Mehmed Ali, who favored the war, had helped instigate the students. Re≈üid, with the help of Lord Stratford, had Mehmed deposed and even exiled to Kastamonu after it was discovered that he had held large sums of money from the Ottoman government.Saab, 136 Over the Spring of 1854, Re≈üid used his position as Foreign Minister to coordinate Ottoman naval movements with France and Britain.Saab, 144-45 He also was able to officially drag both Britain and France into the war with a military alliance in March 1854.Saab, 150 In November of that year, he was rewarded with an appointment as Grand Vizier. However, in May 1855, only a few short months later he was removed from office, leaving him out of the rest of the war and the ensuing peace talks as well. Domestic affairs =Edict of G√ºlhane= Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha is credited with playing a leading role in the authorship of the decree that started the Tanzimat era. The Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane, known as the \\"Edict of G√ºlhane\\" or \\"Rose Garden Edict\\", was read in the rose garden of the Topkapi Palace among foreign diplomats and the sultan Abdulmecid. The edict was the result of the combination of several powerful circumstances. First, after the death of Sultan Mahmud II in 1838, his son Abdulmecid rose to the throne with completely different ideals from his father; unlike his father, who focused on creating a stronger and more powerful throne, Abdulmecid wanted to enact liberal reforms to bring the Ottoman Empire along the lines of other European monarchies.Abdu-Manneh, 182 Secondly, up to this point Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha had been well versed in Orthodox Islam due to his apostleship to Pertev Pasha. Third, Re≈üid Pasha and many of the other Porte officials had been well versed in European political thought and institutions due to their extended connections as current and former ambassadors. In fact, on 11 August 1839, while still in London serving as ambassador, Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha sent a confidential memorandum to then British ambassador Lord Palmerston with whom he had a close relationship. The memorandum was not an Ottoman document but only the personal views of Re≈üid Pasha. He told Lord Palmerston that reform within the Ottoman Sublime Porte was greatly needed and finally doable following the death of Mahmud II and the rise of the young Abdulmecid, who needed to be led in the right direction.Suba≈üƒ±, 1734 Re≈üid Pasha also wrote that the protection and security of the people was mandatory if they were to accept the new reforms he wanted to institute, since their previous rejections were based on the fear of further prosecution by the corrupt Sublime Porte. Furthermore, he put forth that European support and cooperation was mandatory and essential for the preservation of the Ottoman state. All of these thoughts would later appear in the Rose Garden Edict only a few months later. His main goal was to ensure the power of the sultanate while at the same time establishing a strong central bureaucracy within the Sublime Porte to indefinitely postpone the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire.Suba≈üƒ±, 1734‚Äì1738 During this same time period, Re≈üid Pasha also conferred with Austrian diplomat Prince Metternich on government institutional reform.≈†ediv√Ω, 929 Another circumstance was the ongoing crisis with Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The Ottoman Empire was at this time also trying to ensure the support of the Great Powers. The Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane, Re≈üid hoped, would gain foreign and especially British support for the Ottoman Empire due to its better treatment of its subjects, especially the Christian raya. By the end of the summer 1839, the Sublime Porte held a meeting attended by Re≈üid Pasha, Grand Vizier Koca H√ºsrev Mehmed Pasha, and other major bureaucrats. During the meeting, after reading a memorandum from the Sultan, the officials created a petition for the Sultan in which they called for the protection of individual rights and property and the end of the corruption within the government, while all new laws were to remain under the principles of shar‚Äôia law.Abdu-Manneh, 193 This petition would become the Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif of G√ºlhane, or the \\"Edict of G√ºlhane.\\" =Reforms= Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha is credited with being the father of the Tanzimat Reforms, which lasted from 1839 with the reading of the Rose Garden Edict, to 1876 and the creation of the constitution. During this period, Re≈üid Pasha would serve six times as Grand Vizier and several times as Foreign Minister. Re≈üid thought that the Ottoman existence was based on four pillars: Islam, the Osman dynasty, the h√ºk√ºment which was the Ottoman government, and the existence of the capital, Istanbul. He wrote \\"We do not possess the necessary [military] power to maintain the territorial integrity of our state. Consequently, it is our [geographical] position which shall help us preserve [that integrity]. [In order to do so] we must build a good administration. The foreign states shall not leave us in peace. All states aspire to possess Constantinople but the city is indivisible. If we are not able to produce a good administration [the foreign powers] will establish a joint administration [in Constantinople] too\\".Karpat, 190 Immediately following the reading of the Hatti-Sherif of G√ºlhane, Re≈üid Pasha presented the sultan with two propositions concerning the Meclis-i V√¢l√¢ (Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, which had become law on 8 December 1839). First, he wanted to combine the Dar-z ≈ûura-yz Bab-z √Çli, which advised the Office of the Foreign Minister, with the Meclis-i V√¢l√¢, so that there was only one institution advising the Sublime Porte eliminating the frequent contradictions.Shaw, 57 The Meclis-i V√¢l√¢, would also be based out of the Sublime Porte compound, indicating the major influence the Tanzimat reformers would have over the drafting of new legislature. Also in 1841, Re≈üid Pasha renamed the new army, which had replaced the Janissaries after their fall in 1826, the Asakir-i Nizamiye-i ≈ûihane. Re≈üid Pasha also created a new court of justice within the also newly established Ministry of Commerce, which he hoped would promote foreign trade with the Ottoman Empire. The new court would judge on commercial disputes. At the same time he created a new commercial code dealing with bankruptcies, partnerships and bills of exchange which had largely been based on French models.Kinross, 476 Upon questioning by the ulema, Re≈üid responded that Islam had no pertinence to these codes leading to his immediate removal from office as Foreign Minister. Starting in 1846, during Re≈üid Pasha's first two terms as Grand Vizier, the Tanzimat Reforms were at their peak. He focused on creating liberal economic policies, again established commercial courts and laws based on French models, as well as finally abolished slavery and the slave trade within the Empire. Re≈üid also strove to improve the educational system. In 1846 he created the Meclis-i Maarif, a committee of education that was designed to reduce the ulema's influence on education, essentially creating a secular system of learning. In 1847, the Sublime Porte established several middle schools as well as a school for teachers in 1848.Waldner, 162 In 1852, he established an Academy for Sciences, Endj√ºmen-i Dani≈ü, which had been modeled on a French academy. Through this institution, Re≈üid Pasha hoped to conglomerate an extension of texts that could later be used when an Ottoman University would be created.Mardin, 263 He also sought the simplification of the Turkish language, which can be seen in his writings about the Academy for Sciences, in which he states, \\"‚Ä¶insistence is [hereby] placed on the drafting of scientific and technological books written in a simple style and fitted to the needs of popular intelligence so as to provide the means of widening and completing its instruction.\\" In 1846, Re≈üid ordered for the establishment of an archival system in the Sublime Porte, called the Hazine-yi Ewra·∏≥. During his third stint as Grand Vizier which only lasted six months, again reformed the Meclis-I V√¢l√¢ which he stripped of its powers regarding legislation. He create the Meclis-i Tanzimat, or the Council of Reforms, to take over that responsibility. It was officially charged with discussing reforms that would lead to the prosperity of the state.Shaw, 65 =Criticism of Islahat Firmani= The Islahat Firmani, also known as the Isl√¢hat Hatt-ƒ± H√ºm√¢y√ªnu or the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856, was written in 1856 by Britain and France with very little consultation with Ottoman officials. Re≈üid Pasha, at the time was out of office, so he had no influence on the edict. However, with its proclamation, he immediately came out staunchly against the edict. He believed that it was a complete overstep of foreign governments against the sovereignty and principles of the Ottoman government.Karpat, 77 =Grand Vizierate= With only an interruption of four months in 1848, Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha served as Grand Vizier from 1846 to 1852. These years proved to be his most productive in establishing his Tanzimat reforms. He would be disposed under foreign, especially French, pressure in January 1852 due to his strong bias to Britain. Only two months later he was reinstalled as Grand Vizier but only to be removed once again in August, due to a rift between him and the commander of the Imperial Arsenal. During the Crimean War, after his successful negotiation of an alliance with Britain and France, he was reinstalled as Grand Vizier in November 1854. During this short stint as Grand Vizier, again reformed the He was displaced again less than a year later due to his position against the Suez Canal which upset the French who again pressured the Sultan to dismiss Re≈üid Pasha. This dismissal resulted in his exclusion from the treaty talks following the Crimean War. In November 1856 due to British support, Re≈üid Pasha returned again to the Grand Vizierate for a fifth time. For the third time, he was displaced at the hands of the French who disagreed with his position against the formation of a Rumanian state in the Principalities towards the end of July 1857. It was not too long before Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier for the sixth and final time on 22 October 1857. This appointment only lasted a few months, when he suffered a heart attack and died on 7 January 1858. Personal life and death Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha married twice during his lifetime and had a total of five sons, one with his first wife and four with his second.Z√ºrcher, 486 He died of a heart attack on 7 January 1858 in Constantinople. Legacy Although many of the reforms introduced under Re≈üid and the Tanzimat failed to take hold, his influence was widespread. The famed Ottoman poet ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi (another principal author of Tanzimat) called Re≈üid an \\"apostle of civilization\\" and \\"president of virtuous people\\" (Millennium 65). After Re≈üid Pasha's death, his prot√©g√©s Fuad Pasha and Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha, as well as Cevdet Pasha, continued their service to the state along with Re≈üid's many sons. Mehmed Ali and Fuad led the Tanzimat reforms following their leader's death.Waldner, 1624 Re≈üid Pasha led the strengthening of the bureaucracy of the Porte while also starting the legal equality of the Empire's subjects. However, poor funds as well as inefficient leaders handicapped many of his installments. Nevertheless, his ideology was ever persistent though in the Ottoman transition from a patriarchal government to a legal one.

He was the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India as well as the Cricket Association of Bengal. He had previously served as the President of the International Cricket Council. Early and personal life Dalmiya was born into a Marwari family of the Baniya (tradesman) caste, originally hailing from Chirawa, Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan and based in Kolkata for many decades. His father, Arjun Prasad Dalmiya, was a businessman based in Kolkata.Biography Dalmiya studied at the Scottish Church College, Calcutta.Some Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 589 He started his career as a wicketkeeper and also opened the batting, playing for one of the leading cricket clubs in Calcutta. After his father's death, Dalmiya took charge of his father's firm ML Dalmiya and Co at the age of 19. The firm constructed Calcutta's Birla Planetarium in 1963. Dalmiya was married to Chandralekha Dalmiya (n√©e Ghose), who was born into a land-owning Bengali family of Pathuriaghata belonging to the Kayastha caste. They were blessed with a son and a daughter. His son, Avishek, took over from his father both in business and at the BCCI. Dalmiya's daughter, Vaishali (born 1969), In 2016, shortly after her father's death, joined the Trinamool Congress, was immediately given the ticket to contest the assembly election from the Bally constituency, and was subsequently elected to the state assembly. Career Dalmiya joined the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 1979 as a representative of Cricket Association of Bengal, and became its treasurer in 1983 (the year India won the Cricket World Cup). Along with bureaucrat Inderjit Singh Bindra and cricket administrator NKP Salve, Dalmiya proposed the hosting of 1987 World Cup in the Indian subcontinent. The proposal received opposition from England, which had hosted all three previous World Cups. However, in 1984, with support votes from Associate nations, the proposal passed through International Cricket Council (ICC) with a huge majority. The 1987 World Cup was the first time the Cricket World Cup was held outside England, and paved way for rotation system for hosting the tournament. Dalmiya ensured the final was played at Kolkata, renovating its clubhouse in time. Dalmiya proposed the re-entry of South Africa to international cricket in 1991 and ensured South Africa's three-match ODI tour of India the same year. Dalmiya's role is said to have been important, as the then ICC President Clyde Walcott was not in favor of discussing South Africa's re-entry to cricket. In November 1991, South Africa played their first international match since their suspension from international cricket in 1970, an ODI at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in front of over 100,000 spectators. This match also marked South Africa's return to international sports ending their sporting boycott. In 1993, Dalmiya along with Bindra won a legal battle against broadcaster Doordarshan for selling the television rights of cricket matches in India. The outcome of the legal battle was that Doordarshan had to pay the BCCI for acquiring the rights to televise Indian matches. In 1995, the rights were ruled by the Supreme Court of India as a commodity owned by BCCI and could be sold to the highest bidder. The ruling allowed BCCI generate more revenue and strengthened BCCI's position in the global marketplace. With the help of Dalmiya and the then BCCI President Madhavrao Scindia, the Indian subcontinent secured the hosting rights for the 1996 World Cup, turning the tables on the favorites England. The victory was described in The Times as, \\"Asian tiger twists Lord's by the tail.\\" However, Australia and West Indies refused to play in terror-scarred Sri Lanka during the tournament. Dalmiya, who was then the Secretary of BCCI, created a united India-Pakistan team (called the Wills XI) in a matter of days to play a goodwill match against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. With a record-breaking deal for TV rights being signed for the World Cup, the tournament went on to become a major commercial success. In 1996, Dalmiya received 23 votes to 13 for Australia's Malcolm Gray in an election for Chairman's post of the ICC, but failed to attain the two-thirds majority necessary under the ICC Constitution. However, in 1997 he was unanimously elected President of the ICC (as the position had been renamed), the office of which he held for three years. He thus became the first Asian and the first non-cricketer at the helm of ICC. During his tenure as President, Dalmiya's support was instrumental in awarding Bangladesh the Test status. Bangladesh went on to play their first Test match in November 2000 against India at Dhaka. He had also supported Bangladesh in winning the hosting rights of the first-ever ICC Knockout Trophy in 1998. He brought about a major overhaul in the ICC and is credited with helping ICC generate more revenue. The profits made from World Cup were directed to the ICC instead of the host nations, strengthening ICC's power over the World Cup. Since the 1999 edition of the tournament, the World Cup has been officially called \\"ICC World Cup\\". When Dalmiya took over as ICC President in 1997, ICC had funds of ¬£16000 and when his term ended in 2000, it had over $15 million. After his stint as ICC President, Dalmiya was elected the President of BCCI for the first time in 2001. Later the same year, he was involved in a major row with the ICC over what was called the 'Denness Affair' in which the ICC match referee and former England captain Mike Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of a technical breach of the rules (misreported in the Indian media as an allegation of ball-tampering) and gave him a fine and suspended sentence, while also banning Virender Sehwag for one match for claiming a catch off a bump ball. There was a major argument about the issue and questions were asked in the Indian Parliament. Dalmiya demanded a right of appeal from the ICC, which was refused, and also demanding that Denness be replaced as match referee for the following test or it would be cancelled. Ultimately, as Denness was not permitted to referee the final match of the series by the BCCI and the UCBSA, the match was stripped of Test status by the ICC. Contracts to Indian team players, and pensions to former cricketers and umpires were first awarded in 2003 when Dalmiya was the Board's President. In the 2005 BCCI board elections, Dalmiya's candidate Ranbir Singh Mahendra was ousted by Indian government minister Sharad Pawar as the head cricket official of India. Later the following year, Dalmiya was expelled from the board for alleged misappropriation of funds and refusing to provide certain documents. However, in May 2007, when he challenged the decision in the Bombay High Court and then the Supreme Court, he was exonerated as the BCCI was unable to prove their charge of financial irregularities against him. In July 2010, the Calcutta High Court dismissed charges against Dalmiya, and allowed him to contest the presidency of the Cricket Association of Bengal, which he subsequently won. In June 2013, Dalmiya was appointed as the interim president of the BCCI after N. Srinivasan stepped aside till the probe on Srinivasan's son-in-law's alleged involvement in spot-fixing in the 2013 Indian Premier League was completed. Srinivasan resumed the presidency in October 2013. On 2 March 2015, Dalmiya returned as BCCI President after a 10-year gap replacing Srinivasan. Awards and recognition In 1996, the BBC described Dalmiya as one of the world's top six sports executives. In 2005, he was awarded the International Journal of the History of Sports Achievement award for administrative excellence in global sport. Dalmiya was often cited in the media as the man responsible for commercializing cricket and making BCCI the richest board in the world. He was also credited with breaking Australia and England's \\"monopoly\\" of ICC and establishing the presence of Indian subcontinent in international cricket. He was nicknamed in the media the \\"Machiavelli of Indian cricket\\", the \\"master of realpolitik\\", the \\"king of comebacks\\". Australian cricketer and commentator Ian Chappell has said of Dalmiya: \\"He has a vision for the game‚Äôs progress that I haven‚Äôt heard enunciated by any other so-called leader among cricket officials.\\" Death Dalmiya began his second term as BCCI president in March 2015. But he was ailing since then, and his health deteriorated further in September. On 17 September 2015, he suffered a massive heart attack and was admitted to the B.M. Birla Hospital in Kolkata. He remained at the Intensive Care Unit and a five-member medical board was set up for his treatment. He died on 20 September 2015 after he had also undergone a coronary angiography. The cause of death was reported to be gastrointestinal bleeding and organ failure. After his death, Dalmiya's eyes were donated to Vanmukta Eye Bank in the city. On 21 September 2015, Dalmiya's body was taken from his house in Alipore to the Cricket Association of Bengal office at the Eden Gardens. Several dignitaries arrived in Kolkata, including former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, to pay their last respects to him. Among those who sent condolences for Dalmiya's death were President of India Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, current and former cricketers, ICC and various national cricket boards.

The program was initially intended to weed out vehicles producing unrestrained amounts of particulate emissions contributing to smog and increasing pollution. It applies only to vehicles registered in southern parts of Ontario from Windsor to Ottawa due to the volume of vehicles in that part of the province. It is administered by privately owned facilities (such as auto repair shops and vehicle dealerships) that have been accredited by Ontario's Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) and the Ministry of Transportation (MTO). At its inception, the program required light duty vehicles under 4,500 kg (cars, SUV, light trucks) that were over three years old to have an emissions test completed every two years (vehicles manufactured on even years are tested on odd years and vehicles manufactured on odd years are tested on even years) before the vehicle's owner or lessor can renew their licence plate. Vehicles that were manufactured up to and including 1988 are exempt as new vehicle emissions standards were coming into effect beginning in 1989. The minimum age for testing has been increased twice since the beginning of the program. As of 2011, vehicles that are over seven years old require emissions testing, however vehicles manufactured before 1988 are exempt from the test.Drive Clean Website On September 28, 2018, the Ontario government announced the cancellation of the Drive Clean program and instead focusing on heavy duty vehicles; the change became effective on April 1, 2019. Heavy duty trucks and buses are also covered by Drive Clean program. They are tested annually once the vehicle is more than one year old, with no age limit to testing; A 1975 diesel powered truck or bus would still be tested so long as it was still registered. All vehicles on Ontario roads are further monitored by a 'smog patrol' team for MOECC and can be stopped at random and roadside tested. The Smog Patrol team drive vehicles that are equipped with mobile testing equipment to perform roadside tests. The Smog Patrol can also perform a visual inspection to ensure all emissions control equipment is in place and functioning as originally built (tampering with or removing this equipment is an offence separate from Drive Clean but under the same Regulation). Some registrants circumvent an emissions test by registering their vehicles to addresses outside the Drive Clean testing areas. Circumventing an emissions test in this way is an offence and could result in a ticket or summons and could also result in licence plates being seized. Changing standards The Drive Clean program has undergone several changes since its introduction in 1999. In 2003, standards for light-duty vehicles were tightened to require 11.5% lower vehicle emissions than the most stringent American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended standards. On November 18, 2005, the Minister of the Environment, announced several proposed changes to the Drive Clean program.Drive Clean Website Standards were tightened by a further 11.5%. Newer vehicles, which have a very high pass rate due to better emission control technology off the assembly line, were exempted from the program until they are seven years old. Critics Critics have long argued against emissions testing, however the cost of equipment purchased to perform emissions tests in 1998/1999 would not be fully amortized until 2014 and therefore the program has been continued despite calls for its cancellation. Ontario is now the only province in Canada requiring emissions testing on its vehicles, with British Columbia phasing out their program December 31, 2014. In 2012, Ontario's Auditor General determined that the Drive Clean program, which was supposed to be revenue neutral had a surplus and was expected to have a surplus of $50M by 2018. As a result, the Government of Ontario reduced the price of emissions testing from $35 CAD to $30 CAD. Test accuracy In 2014, testing methods were changed from tailpipe emissions testing to using the On Board Diagnostics (OBDII) port under the driver's side dashboard. OBDII was introduced in 1996 and became standard in 1997 on all new vehicles. Older vehicles that are not equipped with the OBDII port continue to be tested under the older tailpipe emissions platform. Drive Clean's emissions test results have been shown to be unreliable in surveys carried out by the media such as in-depth work done by The Hamilton Spectator,\\"Your car failed Drive Clean? Try, try, try again\\", The Hamilton Spectator the Fraser Institute,\\"False Failures\\", Fraser Institute and consumer advocacy groups such as the Automobile Protection Association. In APA surveys, it was shown that the same car can have extremely variable results in test results (up to 800 percent in one survey), even at the same garage or on the same day with no work being carried out on the car. In 2004, the Ontario Auditor General reported on myriad cases of fraud within the Drive Clean program,\\"Auditor slams Drive Clean program\\", autonet.ca such as test facilities (garages) that, for a fee, would test a clean car and report those results instead. Other test facilities would fail a well-tuned car to generate additional work. For these reasons and others, consumer reports suggest drivers try another garage if their car fails a Drive Clean test, before proceeding with expensive repairs. Equity concerns Ontario's Drive Clean program provides no financial assistance to low-income drivers. This contrasts with otherwise similar mandatory emissions testing programs such as those in California, Texas and Arizona. Critics of Drive Clean, including the province's own consulting firm, the Eastern Research Group, have strongly recommended that financial assistance should be provided. The repair cost limit is about to triple since the program's inception (from $200 to $450, and a proposed $600 RCL) while emissions standards have simultaneously become 23% more stringent leading to a greater percentage of vehicles that fail emissions tests. The social welfare effect is similar to that of a regressive tax, one imposed on drivers who cannot afford newer cars.\\"Vehicle Emissions Testing: AirCare, Drive Clean, and the Potential of Inspection and Maintenance Programs in Canada\\" , Fraser InstituteInequity in Ontario's Drive Clean Program In 2006, some unofficial current estimates put the total cost of the program to Ontario motorists close to 2 billion dollars. The most recent verifiable figure, $1.1 billion (in 2004), consists of some $435 million in Drive Clean test fees, and about $690 million for repairs to vehicles that failed. Costs for preliminary repairs to vehicles in order to qualify for Drive Clean tests have never been included in these figures, such as repair or replacement of corroded exhaust system components. Drive Clean test facilities are free to refuse to test any vehicle until such preliminary repairs are made. The Ontario government also has a program to purchase and scrap old polluting cars called Car Heaven. This program is sponsored by General Motors and Exxon-Mobil among others. It is structured in a way which will cost taxpayers little, and acts as a small incentive for people to scrap older cars. This has the effect of boosting prices for remaining used cars by reducing supply, making it somewhat more expensive for low-income persons to drive in Ontario. Currently, the average car donation to Car Heaven is 16 years old (model year 1990-1991). The typical vehicle donated to Car Heaven would otherwise have been on the road for three more years. Impacts on air pollution Drive Clean's impact on air pollution in Ontario has been contested. Since its creation in 1999 the Ontario Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association have each released estimates of the number of illnesses caused by air pollution in Ontario. The Ontario Medical Association estimated in 2005 that total air pollution (from all sources) would cause some 5,800 deaths and 17,000 hospital admissions that year. It also estimated that the direct health care costs of air pollution in Ontario were about $507 million, and the total economic cost of air pollution to be about $7.8 billion. However, three years later the Canadian Medical Association released a report that estimated that in 2008 there would be 4,597 hospital admissions in Ontario caused by air pollution, of which around 1,178 would result in acute premature death. It also suggested that in the year 2031 there would be 2,222 deaths in Ontario caused by air pollution, compared to 7,774 hospital admissions. In addition, the number of smog advisory days in Ontario peaked in 2005 at 53 days. In 2013, there were only two smog advisory days in Ontario. In addition, there were no smog days reported in 2015, according to a report by Air Quality Ontario http://airqualityontario.com/downloads/AirQualityInOntarioReportAndAppendix2015.pdf In late 2004, Norm Sterling, who was the Environment Minister in the Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris's cabinet, stated that Drive Clean had already had its greatest impact on air pollution and had served its purpose.\\"Drive Clean founder: put on the brakes\\", Hamilton Spectator Sterling is often referred to as the founder of Drive Clean. Drive Clean can only address a small fraction of the total automobile emissions problem, because all internal combustion vehicles burn fuels which ultimately pollute the air (including most so-called \\"alternative\\" fuels). The Greenpeace co-founder, Robert Hunter, wrote in 1999 that Drive Clean \\"has turned out to be an agonizing bureaucratic nightmare that hits drivers with what is basically another tax and a huge hassle, while accomplishing  in Environmental Commissioner Eva Ligeti's assessment  'minimal benefits.'\\"\\"Voting green? Vote Liberal\\", eye.net Critics of Drive Clean, who included Hunter and many other environmentalists argue that a greater long-term impact on overall air quality would result from reinvesting the same provincial resources towards encouraging low-emitter technologies, some of which offer electric power as an alternative to 100% internal combustion propulsion. There has been a call for the Ontario government to admit to Drive Clean's minimal impact, and to begin promoting low-emissions vehicles such as hybrid cars, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, zero-emission vehicles such as the ill-fated General Motors EV1, and personal transports like the Segway PT. Unlike over 40 U.S. states, the Ontario government has banned low-speed electric vehicles citing \\"safety concerns\\". On March 23, 2006, Ontario's McGuinty government doubled their former $1,000 ceiling sales tax rebate on hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius up to a maximum of $2,000, but stopped short of making such vehicles PST-free. Politicians Norm Sterling and Howard Hampton have argued that diverting the same provincial funds used for paying for Drive Clean towards improving existing public transit networks might have yielded a far greater overall environmental benefit. Proper funding may have also acted to reduce the well- documented disproportional fare increases seen in Toronto from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in recent years. The TTC has argued in the past that with riders covering more than 80 per cent of the cost of operating the TTC, it is by far the least-funded mass transit system in North America and one of the least-funded in the world. Another lost opportunity to reduce smog was the quiet shut-down of the Hamilton Street Railway's all-electric trolleybus routes in 1992. The Ontario government has however invested toward expanding public transit in Ontario. It agreed to fund a variety of transit projects under The Big Move. The future of Drive Clean On June 7, 2010, the Ministry of Environment posted a request for proposals on MERX Canadian Public Tenders service. The modernized Drive Clean program, which was fully implemented on January 1, 2013, is intended to provide significant benefits by implementing OBD2 testing. Since January 1, 2013, the OBD2 testing has led to an average of 10% failure rate. On 1 April 2017, the $30 fee for a drive clean test was eliminated, however if failed the first time, $17.50 will be paid for subsequent tests. Vehicles manufactured before 1988 are exempt from the test. On September 28, 2018, the Ontario government under Doug Ford announced the cancellation of the Drive Clean program and instead focusing on heavy duty vehicles; the change became effective on April 1, 2019.

Described as an \\"aggressive batsman\\", Wadekar made his first-class debut in 1958, before making his foray into international cricket in 1966. He batted at number three and was considered to be one of the finest slip fielders. Wadekar also captained the Indian cricket team which won series in the West Indies and England in 1971(first victory of Indian team in test cricket outside of India was recorded in 1968 under the captaincy of Tiger Pataudi against New Zealand). The Government of India honoured him with the Arjuna Award (1967) and Padmashri (1972), India's fourth highest civilian honour. Career =Early life and introduction to cricket= Born in Bombay, Wadekar's father wished him to study Mathematics so that he could become an engineer, but Wadekar instead preferred to play cricket. He made his first-class debut for Bombay in 1958‚Äì59, before making his international debut in Test in December 1966, against the West Indies at the Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. After that he became a part of the regular team, and went on to play 37 Test matches for India between 1966 and 1974, generally batting at number three. =Captaincy and overseas wins= Wadekar was appointed the captain of Bombay, and soon was made the captain of the Indian cricket team in 1971, leading a side that included players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Farokh Engineer, and the Indian spin quartet that included Bishen Bedi, E.A.S. Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan. India won over five matches in the West Indies in the early 1970s, and then defeated England over three. He led India to a third successive series victory, beating England cricket team again, 2‚Äì1 in a five-match series in 1972‚Äì73. Wadekar continued to be the captain of the Indian team that toured England in 1974. He represented India in its first ever One Day International (ODI) game during that tour. Batting at number three, Wadekar made 67 runs, but still ended on the losing side. He scored 73 runs in his ODI career at an average of 36.50 with a strike rate of 81.11. Following India's dismal performance in the series, he retired from international cricket. After that tour Wadekar played just one more First-class match before retiring from all forms of cricket. =Post retirement= Wadekar also served as the manager of the Indian cricket team in the 1990s, alongside captain Mohammad Azharuddin. He is one of the few Indians to represent the country as Test player, captain, coach/manager and the chairman of selectors. Lala Amarnath and Chandu Borde are the only other players to achieve this distinction.He is the founder of the Indian Cricket Team for the physically challenged.  Death  On 15 August 2018, Wadekar died due to illness at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, at the age of 77. On 17 August, he was cremated with full state honours in the Shivaji Park crematorium in Mumbai. Many cricketers, as well as cricket fans in large numbers, attended his funeral. Awards and honours Wadekar was honoured with the Arjuna Award, instituted by the Government of India to recognise sporting talents. In 1972, he received the Padmashri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. Other awards include CK Nayudu Lifetime achievement award, Sportsperson of the Year, and the Castrol Lifetime Achievement award.

While the party has described itself as a \\"centre alternative,\\" it has been described externally as a right-wing populist party. It agitated against immigration from the 1980s, but toned down the issue in the 2000s, focusing more on local, social and economic issues. The party had some local representation from the 1970s, until 2006, when it lost its final local seat. History The party was founded in June 1974 by the lead of John G√∂rnebrand of Simrishamn as an alliance of multiple local parties in Scania. It was mainly modeled after the Danish Centre Democrats, including influences from Mogens Glistrup and his Progress Party. The party won several local municipal seats in elections during the 1970s and 1980s, and was even represented in the municipal government in B√•stad in a cooperation with the Moderate Party after the 1979 election. Before the 1982 election, Harry Franz√©n was elected as new party chairman, and the party started to focus considerably more on immigration issues. The party began speaking against immigrant native language education and called the refugee policy a \\"travel agency mafia\\" for refugees. During the Refugee controversy in Sj√∂bo, the party supported the side of Sven- Olle Olsson. Right after the 1988 election, the Centre Democrats split in two factions, led by Harry Franz√©n and John Nielsen. Nielsen broke away in early 1989 with the local Svedala chapter, and turned it into a local chapter of the Progress Party. By the 1991 election, he had however gone back to the Centre Democrats. In turn, many leading members of the Centre Democrats went over to New Democracy by the same election. By 1997, the party had just around 300 members. For the 2006 election the party lost its final local representation, a seat it had held in Sval√∂v.

The party is the Swedish section of the LaRouche Movement. History The movement was established as the European Labour Committees (ELC) in 1974 by two American LaRouchians, William \\"Bill\\" Jones and Michael Vale. Bill Jones had lived in Sweden since 1968, as an apparent Vietnam war deserter. The movement started to build its organization around the young Swedish student Kerstin Tegin, later Tegin-Gaddy, and her American husband to-be Clifford G. Gaddy. However, the party never became much bigger than a handful of people. During this period, Sweden was one of the few countries that openly harboured and encouraged American GIs in Vietnam to defect, and it is often insinuated that EAP was set up in Sweden by the CIA in order to label the defectors as left-wing extremists.Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, August 2, 1976, on EAP and Kerstin Tegin The EAP launched campaigns in the 1980s based on what was described by the Swedish government as \\"extreme hatred of [Swedish PM Olof] Palme\\".SOU 2002:87 Rikets s√§kerhet och den personliga integriteten , Swedish Government Official Report, p. 239 A 2002 government report stated: > It became increasingly common in the media to characterize the EAP as > \\"fascist\\" or \\"right-wing extremist\\".

It is often used as one of the regulations in city planning along with the building-to-land ratio. The terms can also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio through zoning. As a formula FAR =  Terminology  Floor Area ratio is sometimes called floor space ratio (FSR), floor space index (FSI), site ratio or plot ratio. The difference between FAR and FSI is that the first is a ratio, while the latter is an index. Index numbers are values expressed as a percentage of a single base figure. Thus an FAR of 1.5 is translated as an FSI of 150%. = Regional variation = The terms most commonly used for this measurement vary from one country or region to the next. In Australia floor space ratio (FSR) is used in New South WalesNSW Department of Planning , retrieved 19 August 2010 and plot ratio in Western Australia.Quick Start Guide to Town Planning in the City of South Perth , retrieved 19 August 2010 In India floor space index (FSI) and floor area ratio (FAR) are both used. In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong both plot ratio and site ratio are used.University of Dundee: Town and Regional planning, retrieved 19 August 2010 In Singapore the terms plot ratio and gross plot ratio (GPR) are more commonly used. In the United States and Canada, floor space ratio (FSR) and floor area ratio (FAR) are both used. Use ratios are used as a measure of the density of the site being developed. The ratio is generated by dividing the building area by the parcel area, using the same units.  History  One of the purposes of the 1916 zoning ordinance of New York City was to prevent tall buildings from obstructing too much light and air. The 1916 zoning ordinance sought to control building size by regulating height and setback requirements for towers. In 1961, a revision to the zoning ordinance introduced the concept of floor area ratio (FAR). Buildings built before 1961 often have FARs that would be unachievable today, such as the Empire State Building which has an FAR of 25 - meaning that it earns considerably greater rent than a newer building on the same land could hope for.  Purpose and use  The floor area ratio (FAR) can be used in zoning to limit urban density. While it directly limits building density, indirectly it also limits the number of people that a building can hold, without controlling a building's external shape. For example, if lot must adhere to a 0.1 FAR, then the total area of all floors in all buildings on the lot must be no more than one-tenth the area of the parcel itself. In other words, if the lot was 10,000 sq. ft, then the total floor area of all floors in all buildings must not exceed 1,000 sq. ft. An architect can plan for either a single-story building consuming the entire allowable area in one floor, or a multi-story building that rises higher above the plane of the land, but which must consequently result in a smaller footprint than would a single-story building of the same total floor area. By combining the horizontal and vertical limits into a single figure, some flexibility is permitted in building design, while achieving a hard limit on at least one measure of overall size. One advantage to fixing this parameter, as opposed to others such as height, width, or length, is that floor area correlates well with other considerations relevant to zoning regulation, such as total parking that would be required for an office building, total number of units that might be available for residential use, total load on municipal services, etc. The amounts of these things tend to be constant for a given total floor area, regardless of how that area is distributed horizontally and vertically. Thus, many jurisdictions have found it unnecessary to include hard height limitations when using floor area ratio calculations. Common exclusions to the total calculation of square footage for the purpose of floor area ratio (FAR) include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, stair towers, elevator shafts, and parking garages. = Japan = Japan has extensively adopted the floor area ratio in the zoning system since 1970. = India = In India FAR and FSI are both used. FAR regulations vary from city to city and generally it is from 1.3 to 3.25. In Mumbai 1.33 is the norm but higher FSI is allowed along the Metro rail line and slum areas like Dharavi. In Bangalore, 40 feet streets allow only an FAR of 1.75 but 100 feet streets allow 3.25 FAR.  Impact on land value  FAR has a major impact on the value of the land. Higher allowable FAR yields higher land value.  Criticism  Andres Duany et al. (2000) note: # Abdicating to floor area ratios (market forces) is the opposite of aiming a community toward something more than the sum of its parts. # FAR, a poor predictor of physical form, should not be used when the objective is to conserve and enhance neighborhood character; whereas traditional design standards (height, lot coverage and setbacks or build-to lines) enable anyone to make reasonably accurate predictions, recognize violations, and feel secure in their investment decisions. # If FAR is carelessly combined with traditional setbacks, assembled lots have a considerable advantage over individual lots, which has a negative effect on fine-grained cities and the diversity of ownership. Clarifying Duany's second criticism in reference to \\"lot coverage\\": If localities seek to regulate density through floor area ratio, the logical consequence is to encourage expansive one story building with less green space, as single story construction is less expensive than multi-story construction on a per square foot basis. On the other hand, if density is regulated by building coverage ratio (a.k.a. lot coverage or site coverage) then green space can be preserved and multi-story construction becomes financial advantageous. This outcome is demonstrated in the illustration comparing FAR to BCR.  Footnotes   References  Meriam, Dwight (2004). The Complete Guide to Zoning. McGraw- Hill. * Birch, Eugenie L.

He was a hard-hitting middle order batsman and an occasional medium pace bowler. He was the coach of Mumbai Champs in the Indian Cricket League, but returned to the mainstream when he cut ties with the unofficial league in 2009. He has been appointed as the director of National Cricket Academy (NCA) by the BCCI, replacing Dav Whatmore. He was appointed as the new chief of the BCCI Selection Committee on 27 September 2012. Early life Sandeep Patil was born on 8 August 1956 in Mumbai. His father, Madhusudan Patil, was a former first class cricketer, national level badminton player and skilled player of tennis and football. He grew up in the Shivaji Park area in Bombay, studied in Balmohan Vidyamandir and Ramnarain Ruia College and was coached by Ankush 'Anna' Vaidya. Cricket career In the early part of his career Patil was as much a medium pacer who bowled off the wrong foot, as he was a batsman. Following three successful years for the Bombay university in the Rohinton Baria Trophy, he made the Bombay Ranji team in 1975‚Äì76. After being on and off the team for three seasons, he played his first major innings against Delhi in the 1979 semifinal. Going in at No.6 after Bombay lost the first four wickets for 72, Patil hit 145 in 276 minutes with 18 fours and a six, none of his partners made more than 25. Patil played for Edmonton in the Middlesex league in 1979 and 1980, and for Somerset 'B' in the latter year. Australia and Pakistan visited India in 1979‚Äì80. Patil appeared in tour matches for West Zone against both teams, scoring 44 and 23 against Australia, and 68 and 71 against Pakistan. This earned him the selection in the last two Test matches against Pakistan. A week before making the debut, he made his career best first class score against Saurashtra at the Wankhede Stadium. Coming in to bat in the second morning he was 45* at lunch, reached his hundred in 139 balls scoring 105 in the second session, and ended up with 210 made in 205 balls with seven sixes and nineteen fours. The last of the sixes cleared the stadium (a very rare feat at the Wankhede) and landed in the hockey grounds outside. Patil made 62 in the final Test at Calcutta, appeared in the Golden Jubilee Test against England later in the season and was selected for the tour of Australia in 1980‚Äì81. In the early matches of the Australian tour, he scored 116 against South Australia, which included Rodney Hogg, and 60 and 97 against Queensland which had Jeff Thomson, Geoff Dymock and Carl Rackemann. He won the man of the match on his ODI debut for a 64 against Australia. In the first innings of the first Test at Sydney Patil had reached 65 when just before the tea break on the first day, he was hit on the throat by Hogg. Continuing without a helmet, he was hit over the right ear by a bouncer by Len Pascoe in the first over after tea. Patil collapsed in the crease and had to retire hurt. Though still unwell, he batted in the second innings at the insistence of captain Sunil Gavaskar as India struggled to avoid an innings defeat. Two weeks later, with a helmet on, Patil hit a spectacular 174 in the Adelaide Test. It came after India lost the first four wickets for 130 against the Australian total of 528. At the time the highest innings by an Indian in Australia, it took him just over five hours and included twenty two fours and a six over mid-wicket off Bruce Yardley. In the next series against New Zealand, Patil opened the bowling for India along with Kapil Dev in the Auckland Test. Patil found himself out of the team after four Tests in the home series against England in 1981‚Äì82 but was picked for the away series that followed immediately after. Here in the Manchester Test he scored his second hundred. India was in some danger of following on when he added 96 runs with Kapil Dev a little over an hour. England took the second new ball soon after and Patil hit the last two balls of an over from Ian Botham for four and three. In the next over he hit Bob Willis for six fours (4440444, the third ball being a no ball) ‚Äì \\"two cover drives, one flat batted back over the bowler's head, two square cuts of ferocious power and a mighty hook\\" - taking his score from 73 to 104 in nine balls. He was 129 not out when rain brought an early end to the match. Another hundred followed against Sri Lanka in September but he was again out the team by the middle of the season. While the Indian team toured West Indies, he scored 121* in 84 balls in the second innings of the Ranji final against Karnataka. All his runs came in single session on the final day as Bombay was targeting a declaration. Patil scored 216 runs in eight matches in the Prudential World Cup including 51* in the semifinal against England. He scored 609 runs in the 1983‚Äì84 Ranji season, and his fourth and last Test hundred against Pakistan at Faisalabad. On the last day of the Delhi Test against England in December 1984, with his score on 41, Patil was caught at long on attempting a big hit off the bowling of Phil Edmonds. This triggered a collapse and India lost the match that could well have been saved. Patil was dropped in the next test at Kolkata as a disciplinary measure, along with Kapil Dev who also fell to a similar shot off the bowling of Pat Pocock. Mohammad Azharuddin who took his place scored hundreds in his first three Test matches and Patil played no more Test cricket, although Kapil Dev would return to squad. In 1986, he was recalled for a few more one day matches. He also toured England without appearing in Tests. Patil announced his retirement from first class cricket after appearing for Bombay against the Australians in September 1986. But he came back to captain the Madhya Pradesh cricket team from 1988 to 1993 with considerable success. One of the more notable innings was a 185 against Bombay in 1990. He went on to coach the Indian national team and the 'A' team. As the coach of Kenya, he guided them to an unlikely semifinal place in the 2003 World Cup. He served as chairman of selectors of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from 27 September 2012 to September 2016. Bollywood debut Soon after the 1983 Cricket World Cup victory, Patil was offered by Vijay Singh to play the male lead opposite two Bollywood actresses Poonam Dhillon and Debashree Roy in Kabhie Ajnabi The while Syed Kirmani was offered to essay the role of a strong antagonist. Reportedly Patil got so occupied with his Bollywood debut that he refused to participate in the West Indies tour in 1983. Though the cricketer later reasoned that he had opted out of that tour because he was nursing an injury at that time. The filming began in 1983 and the film was released in 1985. The film was highly publicised on the fighting sequence between Patil and Kirmani as well as his chemistry with Debashree Roy especially in the song sequence Geet Mere Hothon Ko Dey Gaya Koi. It opened with 80% seat occupancy but ultimately became a major debacle at box office. ESPN wrote on his performance, ‚Äúhe even aces the love-struck Hindi film hero's signature move of producing notes from a guitar without moving either hand.‚Äù Sportstar commented on his performance that he acted ‚Äúdashed awkward‚Äù in the film. The Tribune wrote, ‚ÄúIn contrast to their heroics in the 1983 World Cup, Patil and Kirmani were clean bowled on the big screen.‚Äù Editing career Patil edited Marathi sports magazine Ekach Shatkar which was, once a top selling sports magazine in Maharashtra. It outsold Sportstar and was often considered as the last nail in the coffin of Sportsweek. The largest selling newspaper Mahanagar was also started in his garage. Personal life In 1983, Patil was married when he met Debashree Roy on the set of Kabhie Ajnabi The (1985) and reportedly had an affair with her. Indian media interpreted their affair as the sole reason for the failure of his first marriage. Reportedly, soon after the release of the film they discontinued their relationship and never publicly discussed anything on their separation. He later married Deepa. He has two sons, Chirag Patil and Prateek Patil. He wrote his autobiography Sandy Storm in 1984.  In popular culture  Chirag Patil will be seen portraying Patil in Kabir Khan's 83 (2020) which also stars Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev.

Originally akin to trading posts, they now resemble contemporary department stores or strip malls. Exact terminology varies by armed service; some examples include base exchange (BX), and post exchange (PX), and there are more specific terms for subtypes of exchange. Operations An AAFES-operated post exchange (now closed) located at the old international airport in Mogadishu, Somalia, in January 1994 A U.S. Army soldier shops for shoes at the base exchange (BX) at Scott Air Force Base in May 2008. Base exchanges sell consumer goods and services to authorized patrons such as active duty, reserve, national guard, retired members of the U.S. Uniformed Services and their dependents. Other authorized patrons include honorably discharged veterans certified 100% disabled and/or totally and permanently disabled (TPD) by the Veterans Administration, recipients of the Medal of Honor, military transition personnel , DoD employees when stationed outside the United States, Red Cross personnel who are U.S. citizens assigned outside the United States with the military service. Authority to use these facilities is normally determined by presentation of the U.S. Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card, either when entering the store or when paying for goods and services. Online base exchange shopping privileges were extended to all honorably discharged veterans beginning on November 11, 2017. The DEERS database is used to verify non-disabled veterans' eligibility for the online shopping benefit. Limited base exchange privileges are extended to members of the Civil Air Patrol and United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC), United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, and Civil Air Patrol cadets may all have varying degrees of privileges (such as only being allowed to shop for uniform items or only being allowed when visiting installations as part of a sponsored activity). Foreign national active duty officer and enlisted members, when visiting U.S. military installation for unofficial business. Merchandise is restricted to quantities required for personal use. At many overseas locations, exchange privileges are determined as part of the local Status of Forces Agreement. Shopping privileges are also generally extended in overseas locations to U.S. federal government civilian employees and their dependents who are assigned overseas. Shopping privileges can vary overseas according to applicable status-of-forces agreements with host nations. A typical exchange is similar to a department store, but other services such as military clothing sales/uniform shops, barber shops, hair care, beauty, laundry/dry cleaning, gas stations, fast food outlets, convenience stores (\\"Expresses\\"), beer and wine sales, liquor stores (\\"Class Six\\" or \\"Package Stores\\"), lawn and garden shops, movie theaters and even vehicle maintenance and repair services are commonly available. Most (but not all) sales by exchanges are free of state and local sales or VAT taxes as the sales take place on U.S. military reservations (exceptions include gasoline sales in the U.S. and sales by concessionaires licensed by the exchange). Unlike commissaries (military grocery stores), exchanges, for the most part, do not receive significant appropriations from the federal government and must operate on a for-profit basis. With the exception of military personnel assigned to duty with the exchange services, exchange service employees' salaries are paid from revenues generated from sales of merchandise, except for annual raises from funds appropriated by Congress. Exchanges are deemed Category C non-appropriated fund (NAF) activities, meaning they are designed to not only be self-sufficient, but generate a profit. Exchanges are normally located on military reservations and, as a result, do not pay rent or tax for the use of land. Exchanges' tax-exempt status (as instrumentalities of the U.S. Government) also reduces certain operating expenses. While exchanges must pay for the cost of transporting goods within the contiguous United States, Congress appropriates funds to subsidize the transportation costs of American merchandise to overseas exchange locations so that such items are available and affordable to personnel stationed overseas. Roughly 70% of the exchange earnings are paid to MWR programs. In the last ten years, more than $2.24 billion has been contributed by the exchange to the Army and Air Force to spend on quality of life improvements for Soldiers, Airmen and their families‚ÄîYouth Services, Armed Forces Recreation Centers, arts and crafts, aquatic centers, post functions and golf courses. Exchanges play an important role for U.S. military and federal government personnel assigned overseas as they are often the only local source for American retail merchandise, such as clothing, electronics, books and magazines, fast food, etc. Exchanges also supply gasoline at prices roughly approximating those in the U.S., normally on a rationed basis, to overseas personnel for personal use, since fuel prices in most foreign countries (where U.S. military are stationed) are normally much higher due to local taxes. Overseas exchanges also sell to authorized personnel new US Specification vehicles made by Ford and Chrysler, as well as Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

Known as an innovative reinterpreter of Buddhist doctrine and Thai folk beliefs, Buddhadasa fostered a reformation in conventional religious perceptions in his home country, Thailand, as well as abroad. Buddhadasa developed a personal view that those who have penetrated the essential nature of religions consider \\"all religions to be inwardly the same\\", while those who have the highest understanding of dhamma feel \\"there is no religion\\". Biography =Early years= He was born Nguam Phanit (; ) in 1906 in Ban Phumriang, Chaiya District, southern Thailand. His father, Sieng PhƒÅnit, was a shopkeeper of second generation Thai Chinese (Hokkien) ancestry and his mother, Klaun, was Thai.Suchira Payulpitack, Buddhadasa's Movement: An Analysis of Its Origins, Development, and Social Impact, a Doctorate dissertation, faculty of Sociology, Universit√§t Bielefeld, 1992: 72-3. =Religious life= Cremation of Buddhadasa in 1993 Buddhadasa renounced civilian life in 1926. Typical of young monks during the time, he traveled to the capital, Bangkok, for doctrinal training but found the wats there dirty, crowded, and, most troubling to him, the sangha corrupt, \\"preoccupied with prestige, position, and comfort with little interest in the highest ideals of Buddhism.\\"Payulpitack, 1992: 123. As a result, he returned to his native rural district and occupied a forest tract near to his village, founding Suan Mokkh in 1932. In later years, Buddhadasa's teachings attracted many international seekers to his hermitage. He held talks with leading scholars and clergy of various faiths. His aim in these discussions was to probe the similarities at the heart of each of the major world religions. Before his death in 1993, he established an International Dhamma Hermitage Center across the highway from his own retreat to aid in the teaching of Buddhism and other yogic practices to international students. The area of Suan Mokkh was expanded to approximately 120 acres of forest. However, Buddhadasa was skeptical of his fame; when reflecting on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, \\"sometimes I think many of these people just stop here because they have to visit the bathroom.\\" Teachings and interpretations Buddhadasa strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate Gautama Buddha's core teaching, \\"Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind.\\" He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life. His ability to explain complex philosophical and religious ideas in his native Southern Thai attracted many people to his wooded retreat. His primary teaching mainly focused on the quiet awareness of one's breathing pattern called anapanasati. However, his personal practice was very much grounded in advanced research and interpretation of early Pali texts on the one hand and on his radical private experimentation on the other. =Rejection of rebirth= Buddhadasa rejected the traditional rebirth and karma doctrine, since he thought it to be incompatible with sunyata, and not conducive to the extinction of dukkha. Buddhadasa, states John Powers ‚Äì a professor of Asian Studies and Buddhism, offered a \\"rationalist interpretation\\" and thought \\"the whole question of rebirth to be foolish\\". According to Buddhadasa, the Buddha taught 'no-self' (Skt anatman, Pali anatta), which denies any substantial, ongoing entity or soul. Powers quotes Buddhadasa view as, \\"because there is no one born, there is no one who dies and is reborn\\". Therefore, states Buddhadasa, \\"the whole question of rebirth has nothing to do with Buddhism... in the sphere of the Buddhist teachings there is no question of rebirth or reincarnation\\". Its goal is nibbana, which Buddhadasa describes as a state \\"beyond all suffering that also transcends ordinary conceptions of happiness.\\" Buddhadasa explains paticcasamupadda as the \\"birth\\" of \\"I\\" and mine through sense-contact with objects, and the resulting vedana (\\"feeling\\"), tanha (\\"thirst,\\" craving) and upadana (clinging). It is by relinquishing the notion of \\"I\\" and \\"mine\\" that selfish clinging is abandoned, and Nirvana or true emptiness will be reached. This can be done by \\"not allow[ing] the dependent arising to take place; to cut it off right at the moment of sense-contact.\\" Buddhadasa's views have been \\"strongly criticized\\"Steve Odin (2011), Reviewed Work: BuddhadƒÅsa: Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand by Peter A. Jackson, Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 61, No. 1, pp. 221-231 and rejected by many of his fellow Theravada Buddhist monks with a more orthodox view of the Buddhist Dhamma. For example, Bhikkhu Bodhi states that Buddhadasa's approach of jettisoning the rebirth doctrine \\"would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters... the conception of rebirth is an essential plank to its ethical theory, providing an incentive for avoiding all evil and doing good\\", summarizes Powers. =No religion= From the earliest period of his religious studies, Buddhadasa utilized a comparative approach and sought to be able to explain \\"Buddhist's teachings through other thought systems such as Taoism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Jainism and Natural Science.\\"Payulpitack, 1992: 97. Through such a methodology he came to adopt a religious world-view wherein he stated, \\"those who have penetrated to the essential nature of religion will regard all religions as being the same. Although they may say there is Buddhism, Judaism, Taoism, Islam, or whatever, they will also say that all religions are inwardly the same.\\" In his No Religion (1993) Buddhadasa further famously remarked: Influence Meditation hall in Buddhadhasa¬¥s Suan Mokkh (Garden of Liberation) monastery Buddhadasa's interpretations of the Buddhist tradition inspired such persons as the French- schooled Pridi Banomyong, leader of the Siamese revolution of 1932, and a group of Thai social activists and artists of the 20th century. Religious scholar Donald K. Swearer has compared Buddhadasa to the early Indian philosopher Nagarjuna,D.K. Swearer, Dhammic Socialism. Bangkok: Thai Inter- Religious Commission for Development, 1986: 14. Cited in Payulpitack, 1992: 103, n. 2. and the 5th-century south Indian scholar Buddhaghosa who has \\"overshadowed the development of Theravada Buddhist thought\\" in southeast Asia. According to Swearer, the Thai teacher Buddhadasa \\"stands in polar opposition to such normative figures as Buddhaghosa\\" in several respects. Buddhadasa's writings, for example, decidedly contrast with the scholastic and highly influential Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa. Buddhadasa has been influential in the arannavasi (forest tradition) of Thai Buddhism, and his ideas have influenced the radical sectarian movement founder Santi Asoke, according to Swearer. According to scholars such as Peter Jackson and Daniel Lynch, Buddhadasa was heavily influenced by the ideas found in Zen Buddhism. Buddhadasa considered the Zen ideas as a way to reconcile Theravada Buddhism with modern humanism, and thought them to be the reason for Japan's economic strength.

(2008) Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, London: Pearson Longman. is a type of porous leather, traditionally the skin of the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), a type of European mountain goat, but today made almost exclusively from the flesh split of a sheepskin. Uses Chamois leather jacket The leather is favored for its gentle, non-abrasive composition and absorption properties. It has a range of uses: * Gloves in the 19th to the first half of the 20th century * Leather jackets, small bags, and pouches * Polishing cloths for jewels or shoes * Filtering fuel * Automotive drying material that is safe on acrylic, lacquer, enamel, and polyurethane paints and clear-coats * General household cleaning * Orthopedics and other medical uses Imitation chamois leather is made using other leathers (such as the domestic goat, or pig), and synthetic chamois leather is usually made from polyvinyl alcohol or non-woven viscose rayon.  United Kingdom  The British Standard BS 6715: 1991Specification for chamois leather Archive.org defines chamois leather as: \\"Leather made from the flesh split of sheepskin or lambskin, or from sheepskin or lambskin from which the grain (the top split) has been removed by frizing, and tanned by processes involving oxidation of marine oils in the skin.\\" United States In the United States, the term chamois without any qualification is restricted to the flesh split of the sheep or lambskin tanned solely with oils (US Federal Standard CS99-1970). Chamois leather is often counterfeited with goat or pig skin, the practice of which is a particular profession called by the French chamoiser. History The term chamois as used to refer to specially-prepared leather originated sometime before 1709, referring to the prepared skin of any goat-like animal, specifically the European antelope‚Äîcommonly called the \\"chamois\\"‚Äîand exclusively used by the glovemaking industry of southwest France. It was discovered that when tanned in the local cod oil of nearby Biarritz, the result was a material of unprecedented absorbency. This leather was fashioned into soft white gloves designed for carriage footmen, who were responsible for the care and polishing of carriages. This industry usage later transferred to the chauffeurs of the \\"horseless carriages\\" invented in the early 1900s. The popularity of chamois leather greatly increased with the advent of mass- produced automobile windshields, which needed to be washed frequently for visibility purposes, but were inconvenient and time-consuming to dry through alternative means. Properties Genuine chamois leather has almost no abrasive properties, and can be used as a very absorbent drying material for any automobile surface. This has made it a popular product for car cleaning and drying. The elasticity of the skin's pores, which are very close, allow it to be used in micro-filtration. Its water absorbency makes it good for other uses, such as in cycling shorts (although most modern cycling shorts now use synthetic \\"chamois\\" leather). It was also used in purifying mercury, which is done by passing it through the pores of the skin. Chamois was historically used as a gasoline filter. When soaked with clean gasoline, chamois will not allow water to pass through its surface fibers. This property is used to filter fuel that has been stored in drums prone to ingress of water, or from any other doubtful source. The technique is to provide a large-mouthed funnel with a wide outlet surface that supports a woven wire base, or metal plate with a grid of holes. The lower part of the funnel is tapered to fit the receptacle or tank-filler aperture. A suitably sized chamois skin is soaked in clean fuel and placed over the grid in the funnel and brought up the sides, forming a bowl, to prevent any leakage past the skin. Fuel can then be pumped into the top of the funnel by the fuel dispenser and watched for signs of water accumulation. The process can be stopped to lift out the assembly from the tank and the trapped water removed so that the job can be continued. Chamois leather is used thus as a fuel filter by boaters, auto detailers, and aircraft refuellers, particularly of a past age when aircraft were flown into very remote areas. Uses Chamois leather is widely used for drying and buffing vehicles, such as cars and vans, after washing. Small pieces of chamois leather (often called \\"chamois cloth\\") are commonly used as blending tools by artists drawing with charcoal. Art supply distributor The leather blends the charcoal more softly and cleanly than the artist's fingers, which can leave smudges. The chamois is also used to lighten the drawing (or portions of it) by removing some charcoal in a more subtle and nuanced way than most erasers could. The charcoal can be washed from the leather using soap and water. Chamois leather is used around professional film and video camera viewfinders, as it provides comfort and absorbs sweat from camera operators who spend a long time with their eye planted on the viewfinder. Divers use towels made of chamois leather to dry themselves between jumps, as they can be quickly dried by squeezing them.

It was introduced in 2004 replacing the Morgan Plus 8. The car is identical to its predecessor except for new modern Ford V6 mechanicals. The new engine develops similar power, though less torque, and is slightly lighter than the Rover V8 which results in increased performance and better fuel economy. Air conditioning is now standard on U.S. models. Like its predecessor, the chassis consists of a standard ladder frame design and is built from galvanised steel with five tubular or box section cross members. The body is built of steel and aluminum around an ash frame. Suspension is traditional Morgan slider type up-front and solid axle / leaf spring at the rear. Unlike its predecessor, the Roadster was available as a 2-seater or a 4-seater.

Succession to power Yusuf ibn Tashfin was a Berber from the Banu Turgut, a branch of the Lamtuna, a tribe belonging to the Sanhaja group. The Sanhaja were linked by medieval Muslim genealogists with the Yemeni tribe of Himyar through semi-mythical and mythical pre-Islamic kings, for which reason some contemporary sources (e.g., Ibn al-Arabi) add the nisba al-Himyari to Yusuf's name to indicate this legendary affiliation. Modern scholarship rejects this Berber‚ÄìYemeni link as fanciful. Abu Bakr ibn Umar, a natural leader of Lamtuna extraction, a branch of the Sanhaja, one of the original disciples of ibn Yasin who served as a spiritual liaison for followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, was appointed chief commander after the death of his brother Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni. His brother oversaw the military for ibn Yasin but was killed in the Battle of Tabfarilla against the Godala tribes in 1056. Ibn Yasin, too, would die in battle against the Barghawata three years later. Abu-Bakr was an able general, taking the fertile S≈´s and its capital AghmƒÅt a year after his brother's death, and would go on to suppress numerous revolts in the Sahara, on one such occasion entrusting his pious cousin Yusuf with the stewardship of S≈´s and thus the whole of his northern provinces. He appears to have handed him this authority in the interim but even went as far as to give Yusuf his wife, Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat, purportedly the richest woman of AghmƒÅt. This sort of trust and favor on part of a seasoned veteran and savvy politician reflected the general esteem in which Yusuf was held, not to mention the power he attained as a military figure in his absence. Daunted by Yusuf's new-found power, Abu Bakr saw any attempts at recapturing his post politically unfeasible and returned to the fringes of the Sahara to settle the unrest of the southern frontier. Taifa appeal In the year 1091, the last sovereign king of al-Andalus, al-Mu'tamid, saw his Abbadid-inherited taifa of Seville, controlled since 1069, in jeopardy of being taken by the increasingly stronger king of Castile-Le√≥n, Alfonso VI. The Taifa period followed the demise of the Umayyad Caliphate. Previously, the emir had launched a series of aggressive attacks on neighboring kingdoms, so as to amass more territory for himself, but his military aspirations and capabilities paled in comparison to those of the Castilian king, who in the name of Christendom, in 1085, captured Toledo and exacted parias, or tribute, from Muslim princes in places such as Granada, al-Mu'tamid of Seville being no exception. The tribute of the emirs bolstered the economy of the Christian kingdom, and harmed the Muslim economy. These are the circumstances that led to the Almoravid conquest and the famous quote, rebuffing his son, Rashid, who advised him not to call on Yusuf ibn Tashfin, where al-Mu'tamid said  Military exploits  Grand mosque, Algiers in 1840 - The mosque was established by Yusuf ibn Tashfin in the 11th century Yusuf was an effective general and strategist who put together a formidable army comprising Sudanese contingents, Christian mercenaries and the Saharan tribes of the Gudala, Lamtuna and Masufa,Halima Ferhat, ‚ÄúY≈´suf b.

Consulted online on 30 August 2020 which enabled him to expand the empire, crossing the Atlas Mountains onto the plains of Morocco, reaching the Mediterranean and capturing Fez in 1075, Tangier in 1079, Tlemcen in 1080, and Ceuta in 1083, as well as Algiers, T√©n√®s and Oran in 1082-83. He is regarded as the co-founder of the famous Moroccan city Marrakech (in Berber Murakush, corrupted to Morocco in English). The site had been chosen and work started by Abu Bakr in 1070. The work was completed by Yusef, who then made it the capital of his empire, in place of the former capital AghmƒÅt. By the time Abu Bakr died in 1087, after a skirmish in the Sahara as result of a poison arrow, Yusef had crossed over into al- Andalus and also achieved victory at the Battle of az-Zallaqah, also known as the Battle of Sagrajas in the west. He came to al-Andalus with a force of 15,000 men, armed with javelins and daggers, most of his soldiers carrying two swords, shields, cuirass of the finest leather and animal hide, and accompanied by drummers for psychological effect. Yusef's cavalry was said to have included 6,000 shock troops from Senegal mounted on white Arabian horses. Camels were also put to use. On October 23, 1086, the Almoravid forces, accompanied by 10,000 Andalusian fighters from local Muslim provinces, decisively checked the Reconquista, significantly outnumbering and defeating the largest Christian army ever assembled up to that point. The death of Yusef's heir, however, prompted his speedy return to Africa. When Yusuf returned to al-Andalus in 1090, he saw the lax behavior of the taifa kings, both spiritually and militarily, as a breach of Islamic law and principles, and left Africa with the express purpose of usurping the power of all the Muslim principalities, under the auspices of the Abbasid caliph of Baghdad, with whom he had shared correspondence, and under the slogan \\"The spreading of righteousness, the correction of injustice and the abolition of unlawful taxes.\\" The emirs in such cities as Seville, Badajoz, Almeria and Granada had grown accustomed to the extravagant ways of the west. On top of doling out tribute to the Christians and giving Andalusian Jews unprecedented freedoms and authority, they had levied burdensome taxes on the populace to maintain this lifestyle. After a series of fatwas and careful deliberation, Yusef saw the implementation of orthodoxy as long overdue. That year he exiled the emirs 'Abdallah and his brother Tamim from Granada and M√°laga, respectively, to AghmƒÅt, and a year later al-Mutamid of Seville suffered the same fate. When all was said and done, Yusef united all of the Muslim dominions of the Iberian Peninsula, with the exception of Zaragoza, to the Kingdom of Morocco, and situated his royal court at Marrakech. He took the title of Amir al-muslimin (Prince of the Muslims), seeing himself as humbly serving the caliph of Baghdad, but to all intents and purposes he was considered the caliph of the western Islamic empire. The military might of the Almoravids was at its peak. The Sanhaja confederation, which consisted of a hierarchy of Lamtuna, Musaffa and Djudalla Berbers, represented the military's top brass. Amongst them were Andalusian Christians and heretic Africans, taking up duties as diwan al-gund, Yusef's own personal bodyguard, including 2,000 black horsemen, whose tasks also included registering soldiers and making sure they were compensated financially. The occupying forces of the Almoravids were made up largely of horsemen, totaling no less than 20,000. Into the major cities of al-Andalus, Seville (7,000), Granada (1,000), Cordoba (1,000), 5,000 bordering Castile and 4,000 in western al-Andalus, succeeding waves of horsemen, in conjunction with the garrisons that had been left there after the Battle of Sagrajas, made responding, for the Taifa emirs, difficult. Soldiers on foot used bows & arrows, sabres, pikes, javelins, each protected by a cuirass of Moroccan leather and iron-spiked shields. During the siege of the fort-town Aledo, in Murcia, previously captured by the Spaniard Garcia Gim√©nez, Almoravid and Andalusian hosts are said to have used catapults, in addition to their customary drum beat. Yusef also established naval bases in Cadiz, Almeria and neighboring ports along the Mediterranean. Ibn Maymun, the governor of Almeria, had a fleet at his disposal. Another such example is the Banu Ghaniya fleet based off the Balearic Islands that dominated the affairs of the western Mediterranean for much of the 12th century. Siege of Valencia Although the Almoravids had not gained much in the way of territory from the Christians, rather than merely offsetting the Reconquista, Yusuf did succeed in capturing Valencia. A city divided between Muslims and Christians, under the weak rule of a petty emir paying tribute to the Christians, including the famous El Cid, Valencia proved to be an obstacle for the Almoravid military, despite their untouchable reputation. Abu Bakr ibn Ibrahim ibn Tashfin and Yusef's nephew Abu 'Abdullah Muhammad both failed to defeat El Cid. Yusef then sent Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali al-Hajj, but he was not successful either. In 1097, on his fourth trip to al-Andalus, Yusef sought to personally dig down and fight the armies of Alfonso VI, making his way towards the all but abandoned, yet historically important, Toledo. Such a concerted effort was meant to draw the Christian forces, including those laying siege to Valencia, into the center of Iberia. On August 15, 1097, the Almoravids delivered yet another blow to Alfonso's forces, a battle in which El Cid's son was killed. Muhammad ibn 'A'isha, Yusef's son, whom he had appointed governor of Murcia, succeeded in delivering an effective pounding to the Cid's forces at Alcira; still not capturing the city, but satisfied with the results of his campaigns, Yusef left for his court at Marrakesh, only to return two years later in a new effort to take the provinces of eastern al-Andalus. El Cid had died in the same year, 1099, and his wife Jimena had been ruling until the coming of another Almoravid campaign at the tail end of 1100, led by Yusef's trusted lieutenant Mazdali ibn Tilankan. After a seven-month siege, Alfonso and Jimena, despairing of the prospects of staving off the Almoravids, set fire to the great mosque in anger and abandoned the city. Yusef had finally conquered Valencia achieving dominance over eastern al-Andalus. He receives mention in the oldest Spanish epic Poema del Cid, also known as El Cantar del Mio Cid. Description and character \\"A wise and shrewd man, neither too prompt in his determinations, nor too slow in carrying them into effect\\", Yusef was very much adapted to the rugged terrain of the Sahara and had no interests in the pomp of the Andalusian courts. According to medieval Arabic writers, Yusuf was of average build and stature. He is further described as having \\"had a clear brown complexion and he had a thin beard. His voice was soft, his speech elegant. His eyes were black, his nose was hooked, and he had fat on the fleshy portions of his ears. His hair was curly and his eyebrows met above his nose.\\" Legacy  His son and successor, Ali ibn Yusuf, was viewed as just as devout a Muslim as his father. C√≥rdoba, in about 1119, served as the launch pad for Andalusian insurrection. Christians on the northern frontier gained momentum shortly after his father's death, and the Almohads, beginning about 1120, were to engulf the southern frontier. This ultimately led to the disintegration of Yusef's hard-gained territories by the time of Ibrahim ibn Tashfin (1146) and Ishaq ibn Ali (1146‚Äì1147), the last of the Almoravid dynasty. While Yusef was the most honorable of Muslim rulers, he spoke Arabic poorly. Ali ibn Yusef in 1135 exercised good stewardship by attending to the University of Al-Karaouine and ordering the extension of the mosque from 18 to 21 aisles, expanding the structure to more than 3,000 square meters. Some accounts suggest that to carry out this work Ali ibn Yusef hired two Andalusian architects, who also built the central aisle of the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, Algeria, in 1136. In popular cultureIn the 1961 movie El Cid, Yusuf ibn Tashfin is portrayed, under the name \\"Ben Yussuf\\", by Herbert Lom. *Yusuf appears in Age of Empires II: The Conquerors as one of the primary antagonists in the \\"El Cid\\" campaign. However, he is described as \\"never showing his face\\", always covering it with a cloth. *Yusuf ibn Tashfin appears as protagonist in Nasim Hijazi's Urdu Novel \\"Yusuf bin Tashfeen\\". *Yusuf ibn Tashfin appears as Hero in the Drama Serial \\"Pukaar\\", presented by Pakistan's Pakistan Television Corporation in 1995. In this series, the main characters were Yousaf bin Tashfin (played by Asal Din Khan), Zainab (Yousaf's wife), Ali (Yousaf's son), Alfonso VI (played by Ayub Khosa), Mutamid bin abi Abbad (played by Hissam Qazi (Late)), and a princess of Leon (played by Laila Wasti). *Yusuf appears in El Cid: the Legend as the primary antagonist. In the film, he is a cruel, unforgiving and evil man. Much unlike his alleged reputation as an honorable man.

It was founded in 1379, and closed in 1816. It was re-established in 1994, three years after German reunification. Therefore it claims to be both the oldest and youngest university in Germany. The institution identifies itself as a reform university, due to its most famous alumnus Martin Luther, the instigator of the Reformation, who studied there from 1501 to 1505. Today, the main foci centre on multidisciplinarity, internationality, and mentoring. The university is home to the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, the Gotha Research Center for Cultural and Social Scientific Studies, and the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy. The Gotha Research Library, which has one of Germany's largest collections of early modern manuscripts, is part of the university. The University Library is also the keeper of the Bibliotheca Amploniana, a collection of nearly 1000 medieval manuscripts collected by the scholar Amplonius Rating de Berka (c.1363-1435), who was a former Rector of the university.Bibliotheca Amploniana .

Awarded to officers, and originally intended as an award for bravery and particularly long or useful service, it eventually became a more or less obligatory award for military officers after a certain number of years in service. There were originally three grades, Knight, Commander and Commander Grand Cross, but these were later multiplied by division into classes. The motto of the order is in Latin: Pro Patria (which means \\"For Fatherland\\"). History The order was created by King Frederick I in 1748, along with two other orders, the Order of the Seraphim and the Order of the Polar Star. In 1788, King Gustav III created two new grades of the order, which could only be bestowed in war time: *\\"Knight Grand Cross First Class\\" - The cross is in shape similar to the Knight's cross, but as large as the Grand Cross badge and is worn on a necklet, and the star is in the shape of an upraised silver sword. It was awarded to division commanders of at least the rank of a major general for achieving a major victory in battle. Even the monarch could only wear the insignia Knight Grand Cross by the unanimous decision of his officers (e.g., Gustavus III, Charles XIII and Charles XIV John. *\\"Knight Grand Cross\\" - The cross is in shape similar to the Knight's cross, but as large as the Grand Cross badge and is worn on a necklet, and the star is in the shape of two crossed upright silver swords. These grades proper were only given to commissioned officers, but an affiliated decoration, the Sv√§rdstecken (\\"Badge of the Sword\\"), introduced in 1850, was given to non- commissioned officers; one thus decorated would call himself a sv√§rdsman (\\"Sword man\\"). A Medal of the Sword was also introduced for enlisted men. Both the non-commissioned officers and the enlisted men had to have served for at least sixteen years to qualify respective for the Badge and Medal. In 1952 a special medal of distinction was added to the order. These could only be bestowed in wartime. They are the War Cross of the Order of the Sword in Gold, in Silver and in Bronze. They are worn on the same ribbon as the order and the medal consist of the cross saltire of the Order struck in gold, silver or bronze, with an upraised sword behind central medallion bearing the Swedish three crowns and in the spaces between the upper and lower arms of the cross. At the top of the points of the upper arms of the cross and of the sword is a small royal crown. Membership of the order has not been awarded since 1975, but technically it still exists. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden frequently wears his Commander Grand Cross necklet and badge. Formerly the reception of new Commanders Grand Cross took place without religious ceremonies in the royal apartments, but in the presence of the other Commanders Grand Cross of the Order, of the Knights of the Seraphim, and the Commanders Grand Cross of all the other orders. By the oath the Commander elect bound himself ‚Äúto defend with life and property the Evangelical-Lutheran religion, to serve faithfully the King and the country, and to combat courageously against the foes of the country.‚Äù When a foreigner was elected a Commander of the Grand Cross, the insignia were sent to him abroad, while he, in his turn, transmitted to the archives of the Order a statement of the services rendered by him. Grades The Order of the Sword in peacetime had five classes: *80px Commander Grand Cross - wears the badge on a collar (chain) or on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left chest; *80px Commander 1st Class - wears the badge on a necklet, plus the star on the left chest; *80px Commander - wears the badge on a necklet; *80px Knight 1st Class - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest; *80px Knight - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest; Knight of the Grand Cross In 1788 king Gustaf III, during the Russo-Swedish War instituted another class of the order, that could only be bestowed in wartime, and only to senior officers whose conduct had had a significant effect on the war. Not even the king of Sweden can wear the decoration until a \\"Swedish army under His command has been victorious, either through combat or conquest\\". The special class is called Knight of the Grand Cross. The breast star is in the shape of an upright sword, and is worn on the left pocket and the badge is worn around the neck.

In addition the badges of the two highest classes also have an upright similar gold and blue sword across the openings at the sides of the cross and an identical pair of crossed gold and blue swords with downwards turned blades across the opening between the lower arms of the cross at the bottom of the badge, the pairs of crossed swords are each tied together and the side swords are bound to the cross by a single gold ribbon which crosses the arms of the cross from behind. The badge hanged from a gold and enamelled royal crown. *The collar of the Order is of gold in the form of eleven gold swords in blue enamelled scabbards with gold belts connected by gold chains and alternating with eleven gold pelte shields each bearing a blue enamelled helmet . *The star of the Order is a silver Maltese Cross, the central medallion bearing the same upright sword between three gold crowns on a blue enamelled background as the badge. The star of the Grand Cross also has golden crowns over short silver triangular rays between the arms of the cross. *The ribbon of the Order is yellow with blue stripes near its borders (i. e., the Swedish national colours). Formerly the Order also had a distinctive blue and yellow habit worn on formal occasions such as at chapters of the Order. The habit included yellow trousers, a yellow knee length coat with blue shoulder tabs and a yellow girdle, each bordered in blue, blue mantle lined with blue satin and a blue shoulder sash with a gold fringe. The star of the Order was embroidered over the left breast of both the coat and the mantle. A black top hat with gold hat band and a plume of white ostrich and black egret feathers and a pair of black boots with gilded spurs completed the habit. The collar of the Order was worn over the shoulders of the coat. =Insignia of the medals=The Badge of the Sword is similar to the knight's silver badge of the Order. The front central medallion is enamelled but the arms of the cross have no white enamel nor is the back of this badge enamelled. *The Medal of the Sword is of also of silver and round with a royal crown on it upper side.

His career in Ottoman politics began by becoming deputy for Adrianople (Edirne) in 1908, then minister of the interior and minister of finance, and finally grand vizier (equivalent to prime minister) in 1917. Acting as the minister of interior, Talaat Pasha ordered on 24 April 1915 the arrest and deportation of Armenian intellectuals in Constantinople (now Istanbul), most of them being ultimately murdered, and on 30 May 1915 requested the Tehcir Law (Temporary Deportation Law); these events initiated the Armenian Genocide. He is widely considered the main perpetrator of the genocide, and thus is held responsible for the death of between 800,000 and 1,800,000 Armenians. On the night of 2‚Äì3 November 1918 and with the aid of Ahmed Izzet Pasha, Talaat Pasha and Enver Pasha (the two main perpetrators of the genocide) fled the Ottoman Empire. Talaat was assassinated in Berlin in 1921 by Soghomon Tehlirian, a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, as part of Operation Nemesis.  Early life  Early portrait Mehmed Talaat was born in 1874 in Kƒ±rcaali town of Adrianople (Edirne) Vilayet into a family of Pomak and Gypsy descent.Taner Timur, [ T√ºrkler ve Ermeniler: 1915 ve Sonrasƒ±], ƒ∞mge Kitabevi, 2001, , p. 53. Abdullah I (King of Jordan), Philip Perceval Graves, Memoirs, publisher J. Cape, 1950, p. 40. His father was a junior civil servant working for the government of the Ottoman Empire and was from a village in the mountainous southeastern corner of present-day Bulgaria. Mehmed Talaat had a powerful build and a dark complexion. His manners were gruff, which caused him to leave the civil preparatory school without a certificate after a conflict with his teacher. Without earning a degree, he joined the staff of the telegraph company as a postal clerk in Adrianople. His salary was not high, so he worked after hours as a Turkish language teacher in the Alliance Israelite School which served the Jewish community of Adrianople. At the age of 21 he had a love affair with the daughter of the Jewish headmaster for whom he worked. He was caught sending a telegram saying \\"Things are going well. I'll soon reach my goal.\\" With two of his friends from the post office, he was charged with tampering with the official telegraph and arrested in 1893. He claimed that the message in question was to his girlfriend. The Jewish girl came forward to defend him. Sentenced to two years in jail, he was pardoned but exiled to Salonica (Thessaloniki) as a postal clerk. He married Hayriye Hanƒ±m (later known as Hayriye Talaat Bafralƒ±), a young girl from Ioannina on 19 March 1910. Between 1898 and 1908 he served as a postman on the staff of the Salonica Post Office. Eventually, having served 10 years at this postal unit, he became head of the Salonica Post Office.  Young Turk Revolution  In 1908, he was dismissed from membership in the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the nucleus of the Young Turks movement. However, after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, he became deputy for Adrianople in the Ottoman Parliament, and in July 1909, he was appointed minister of interior affairs. He became minister of posts, and then secretary-general of the CUP in 1912. After the assassination of the prime minister (grand vizier), Mahmud ≈ûevket Pasha, in July 1913, Talaat Pasha again became minister of interior affairs. Talaat, with Enver Pasha and Djemal Pasha, formed a group later known as the Three Pashas. These men formed the triumvirate that ran the Ottoman government until the end of World War I in October 1918.  Armenian Genocide  Talaat Pasha at his desk According to various sources, Talaat Pasha had developed plans to eliminate the Armenians as early as 1910. Danish philologist Johannes √òstrup wrote in his memoirs that in the autumn of 1910, Talaat talked openly about his plans to \\"exterminate\\" the Armenians with him. According to √òstrup, Talaat stated: \\"If I ever come to power in this country, I will use all my might to exterminate the Armenians.\\" In November of that year, a decision to carry out such a plan was made in Salonica (Thessaloniki) where a secret conference was held by prominent members of the CUP. The conference concluded that the Ottoman Empire, which promoted equality among Muslims and non-Muslims alike, was not ideologically compatible anymore, and that the Ottoman Empire should adopt a policy of Turkification. Talaat, who attended the conference, was a leading advocate of this policy shift and stated in a speech that \\"there can be no question of equality, until we have succeeded in our task of ottomanizing the Empire.\\" Such a decision ultimately required the assimilation of non-Turkish elements within the empire and if necessary, it could be done through force. British ambassador Gerard Lowther concluded after the conference, \\"[that the] committee have given up any idea of Ottomanizing all the non-Turkish elements by sympathetic and Constitutional ways has long been manifest. To them 'Ottoman' evidently means 'Turk' and their present policy of 'Ottomanization' is one of pounding the non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar.\\" Talaat, along with Enver and Cemal, eventually represented the radical faction of the committee. In 1913, the faction ultimately seized power through a violent coup establishing the rule of the Three Pashas, which was also known as the \\"dictatorial triumvirate\\". The Three Pashas then became largely responsible for the Ottoman Empire's entry into World War I. With the start of World War I, the Three Pashas found a suitable opportunity to begin their campaign of exterminating the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire. As Interior Minister, Talaat ordered Armenians arrested during the Armenian genocide. On 24 April 1915, Talaat issued an order to close all Armenian political organizations operating within the Ottoman Empire and arrest Armenians connected to them, justifying the action by stating that the organizations were controlled from outside the empire, were inciting upheavals behind the Ottoman lines, and were cooperating with Russian forces. This order resulted in the arrest on the night of 24‚Äì25 April 1915 of 235 to 270 Armenian community leaders in Constantinople (Istanbul), including politicians, clergymen, physicians, authors, journalists, lawyers, and teachers, the majority of whom were eventually murdered. Although the mass killings of Armenian civilians had begun in the vilayet of Van several weeks earlier, these mass arrests in Constantinople are considered by many commentators to be the start of the Armenian Genocide. Original copy of Talaat's order of 24 April 1915 to arrest Armenian intellectuals and community leaders Talaat then issued the order for the Tehcir Law of 1 June 1915 to 8 February 1916 that allowed for the mass deportation of Armenians, a principal means of carrying out the Armenian Genocide. The deportees did not receive any humanitarian assistance and there is no evidence that the Ottoman government provided the extensive facilities and supplies that would have been necessary to sustain the life of hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees during their forced march to the Syrian desert or after. Meanwhile, the deportees were subject to periodic rape and massacre, often the result of direct orders by the CUP. Talaat, who was a telegraph operator from a young age, had installed a telegraph machine in his own home and sent \\"sensitive\\" telegrams during the course of the deportations. This was confirmed by Talaat's wife Hayriye, who stated that she often saw him using it to give direct orders to what she believed were provincial governors. In a session of the Ottoman parliament, Ottoman statesman Reshid Akif Pasha testified that he had uncovered documents which demonstrated the process by which official statements made use of vague terminology when ordering deportation only to be clarified by special orders of \\"massacres\\" sent directly from CUP headquarters or often from the residence of Talaat himself. He testified: Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Governor of Erzurum, similarly testified during the Mamuretulaziz (now Elazig) trial that the special forces unit Special Organization (Te≈ükil√¢t-ƒ± Mahsusa), under the command of Behaeddin Shakir, was mobilized to kill Armenians and that this organization was in constant contact with the Ministry of Interior. He explained: Other sources also point to such telegrams directing massacre being sent from Talaat Pasha. Rafael de Nogales M√©ndez, a Venuzelan officer who served the Ottoman Army, visited Diyarbakƒ±r on 26 June 1915 and spoke with the governor Mehmet Re≈üid, who was later known as the \\"butcher of Diyarbakir\\". Nogales M√©ndez recounts in his memoirs that Re≈üid mentioned to him that he received a telegram directly from Talaat ordering him to \\"burn-destroy-kill\\". Abdulahad Nuri, an official in charge of the deportations, testified during the Turkish courts-martial of 1919‚Äì20 that he had been told by Talaat that the goal of the deportations was \\"extermination\\" and that he \\"personally received the orders of extermination\\" from Talaat himself. In many instances, there had been additional instructions to \\"destroy\\" the telegrams after they had been read. Corpses of massacred Armenians, 1918 Numerous diplomats and notable figures confronted Talaat Pasha over the deportations and news of massacres. In one such conversation with German Embassy representative Mordtmann, Talaat stated his aims of annihilating the Christians of Turkey under the cover of World War I: In a memorandum sent to Berlin demanding the removal of German ambassador Paul Wolff Metternich because he interceded on behalf of the Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: \\"the work must be done now, after the war it will be too late.\\" By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador Johann von Bernstorff described his discussion with Talaat: \\"When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians'\\". A similar statement by Talaat was made to Swedish military attach√© Einar af Wirs√©n: \\"The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair- raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved.\\" Talaat is reported to have said the following to American ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (as recorded in Ambassador Morgenthau's Story), who confronted Talaat on several occasions: \\"I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdulhamid II accomplished in thirty years!\\" Morgenthau then relates an exchange he had with Talaat: In another exchange, Talaat demanded from Morgenthau the list of the holders of American insurance policies belonging to dead Armenians in an effort to appropriate the funds to the state. Morgenthau categorically refused his request describing it as \\"one of the most astonishing requests I have ever heard.\\" Notable Turkish politicians and figures also condemned the policy. Turkish feminist Halide Edip, writing in her memoirs, captured a defiant reaction from Talaat Pasha when she probed him on the deportations and extermination. He allegedly told her that he was of the conviction that as long as a nation does what is best for its own interests and succeeds, the world admires it. Abd√ºlmecid II, the last Caliph of Islam of the Ottoman Dynasty, said: \\"I refer to those awful massacres. They are the greatest stain that has ever disgraced our nation and race. They were entirely the work of Talat and Enver.\\"  Turkification  Talaat Pasha was also a leading force in the Turkification and deportation of Kurds. In 1916 he was a major force behind the policies regarding the resettlements of Kurds and wanted to be informed of whether the Kurds would really be turkified or not and how they got along with the Turkish inhabitants in the areas where they had been resettled too.  Grand vizier, 1917‚Äì1918  In 1917, Talaat became the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, a post equivalent to that of prime minister, but was unable to reverse the downward spiral of Ottoman fortunes in his new position. Over the next year, Jerusalem and Baghdad were lost. On January 11, 1918, the special decree On Armenia was signed by Lenin and Stalin which rearmed and repatriated over 100,000 Armenians from the former Tsar's Army to be sent to the Caucasus for operations against Ottoman interests. At the beginning of January 1918 with the Tsarist Army of the Caucasus departing, he had been influential in pursuing an offensive policy, convinced that despite all the pacifist rhetoric coming from Moscow 'the Russian leopard had not changed its spots'. The fall of Kars on 25 April 1918 reversed Russia's last conquest from the Berlin Treaty (1878) and Ottoman Turkey restored the 1877 borders against its Russian enemy. In October 1918 however, the British shattered both Ottoman armies they faced ‚Äì and the armistice the British forced on Turkey at Mudros (30 October 1918) obliged the Ottoman army to evacuate Transcaucasia.Sean Mcmeekin, The Berlin-Baghdad Express, p.330,337 With defeat certain, Talaat had resigned on 14 October 1918.  Exile, 1919‚Äì1921  The front page of the Ottoman newspaper ƒ∞kdam on 4 November 1918 after the Three Pashas fled the country following World War I. Talaat Pasha fled the Ottoman capital in a German submarine on 3 November 1918, from Constantinople harbour to Berlin. Just a week later the Ottoman Porte capitulated to the Allies and signed the Armistice of Mudros. Public opinion was shocked by the departure of Talaat Pasha, even though he had been known to turn a blind eye on corrupt ministers appointed because of their associations with the CUP. Talaat Pasha had a reputation for being courageous and patriotic, the type of individual who would willingly face the consequences of his actions. With the occupation of Constantinople, Izzet Pasha resigned. Tevfik Pasha took the position of grand vizier the same day that British ships entered the Golden Horn. Tevfik Pasha lasted until 4 March 1919, replaced by Ferid Pasha whose first order was the arrest of leading members of the CUP. = Turkish courts-martial of 1919‚Äì1920 = Following the occupation of Constantinople by the Allied Powers, the British exerted pressure on the Ottoman Porte and brought to trial the Ottoman leaders who had held positions of responsibility between 1914 and 1918 for having committed, among other charges, the Armenian Genocide. Those who were caught were put under arrest at the Bekiraƒüa division and were subsequently exiled to Malta. The courts- martial were designed by Sultan Mehmed VI to punish the Committee of Union and Progress for the empire's ill-conceived involvement in World War I. The Pashas who had held the highest positions in the administration and whose names were at the top of the execution lists of the Armenian assassination teams could be condemned in absentia because they had gone abroad. By January 1919, a report to Sultan Mehmed VI accused over 130 suspects, most of whom were high officials. The indictment accused the main defendants, including Talaat, of being \\"mired in an unending chain of bloodthirstiness, plunder and abuses\\". They were accused of deliberately engineering Turkey's entry into the war \\"by a recourse to a number of vile tricks and deceitful means\\". They were also accused of \\"the massacre and destruction of the Armenians\\" and of trying to \\"pile up fortunes for themselves\\" through \\"the pillage and plunder\\" of their possessions. The indictment alleged that \\"The massacre and destruction of the Armenians were the result of decisions by the Central Committee of Ittihadd\\".V. Dadrian, The History of the Armenian Genocide, pp. 323-324. The Court released its verdict on 5 July 1919: Talaat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim were condemned to death in absentia. right200pxthumbTalaat Pasha with his friends in the years of escape, Holland, 1920 The British were determined not to leave Talaat alone. The British had intelligence reports indicating that he had gone to Germany, and the British High Commissioner pressured Damad Ferit Pasha and the Sublime Porte to demand that Germany return him to the Ottoman Empire. As a result of efforts pursued personally by (Sir) Andrew Ryan, a former Dragoman and now a member of the British intelligence service, Germany responded to the Ottoman Empire stating that it was willing to be helpful if official papers could be produced showing these persons had been found guilty, and added that the presence of these persons in Germany could not as yet be ascertained.Oke, Mim Kemal (1988). The Armenian question 1914‚Äì1923. Nicosia: Oxford 1988, ataa.org = Aubrey Herbert interview, 1921 = The last official interview Talaat granted was to Aubrey Herbert, a British intelligence agent. It was nine days before his assassination. The interview was conducted during a series of short meetings in a park in a small German town. The interview gave chance to Talaat to explain the policies of the Ottoman Empire during the last 10 years. These meetings corroborated earlier intelligence to the effect that Talaat Pasha was seeking support from Muslim countries to form a serious opposition movement against the Allied Powers, and that he was soon intending to take refuge in Ankara, where the Turkish national movement was forming. Furthermore, Talaat Pasha also threatened that he was going to incite the Pan- Turanist and Pan-Islamist movements against the United Kingdom unless it signed a peace treaty favorable for Turkey. During this interview, Talaat maintained on several occasions that the CUP had always sought British friendship and advice, but that Britain was in no mood to offer any assistance whatsoever. = Assassination, 1921 = The headline of a 16 March 1921 New York Times article, announcing Talaat Pasha's assassination by Soghomon Tehlirian. Before the assassination, the British intelligence services identified Talaat in Stockholm, where he had gone for a few days. The British intelligence first planned to apprehend him in Berlin, where he was planning to return, but then changed its mind because it feared the complications this would create in Germany. Another view in British intelligence was that Talaat should be apprehended by the Royal Navy at sea while returning from Scandinavia by ship. In the end, it was decided to let him return to Berlin, find out what he was trying to accomplish with his activities abroad, and to establish direct contact with him before giving the final verdict. This was achieved with the help of Aubrey Herbert. The British intelligence service established contact with its counterpart in the Soviet Union to evaluate the situation. Talaat Pasha's plans made the Russian officials as anxious as the British. The two intelligence services collaborated and signed between them the 'death warrant' of Talaat. Information concerning his physical description and his whereabouts was forwarded to their men in Germany. It was decided that Armenian revolutionaries should carry out the verdict. Talaat was assassinated with a single bullet on 15 March 1921 as he came out of his house in Hardenbergstrasse, Charlottenburg. His assassin was an Armenian Revolutionary Federation member from Erzurum named Soghomon Tehlirian.Operationnemesis.com Soghomon Tehlirian admitted committing the shooting, but after a cursory two- day trial, he was found innocent by a German court on grounds of temporary insanity because of the traumatic experience he had gone through during the genocide.  Legacy  =Immediately following World War I= The New York Times, December 15, 1915 Talaat Pasha received widespread condemnation across the world for his leading role in the Armenian Genocide. He was found guilty of massacre of Armenians and sentenced to death in absentia by the Turkish Court on July 5, 1919.Dadrian, Vahakn, \\"The History of the Armenian Genocide\\", Page 323-324, Berghahn Books, 2003 Commenting on the widespread rape, torture and killings of the Armenians, U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau wrote in his 1919 memoir: =Post mortem= Shortly after the assassination of Talaat in March 1921, the \\"Posthumous Memoirs of Talaat\\" was published in the October volume of The New York Times Current History.Talaat Pasha, \\"Posthumous Memoirs of Talaat Pasha\\", The New York Times Current History, Vol. 15, no. 1 (October 1921): 295 In his memoir, Talaat admitted to purposefully deporting the Armenians to the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces in a prepared scheme. He however blamed Armenian civilians themselves for the deportations, implying the civilian population could have caused a revolution and it was therefore justified to exterminate them.\\"I admit that we deported Armenians from our eastern provinces, and we acted in this matter upon a previously prepared scheme. The responsibility of these acts falls upon the deported people themselves. Russians ... had armed and equipped the Armenian inhabitants of this district [Van] ... and had organized strong Armenian bandit forces. ... When we entered the Great War, these bandits began their destructive activities in the rear of the Turkish army on the Caucasus front, blowing up the bridges and killing the innocent Mohammedan inhabitants regardless of age and sex... All these Armenian bandits were helped by the native Armenians.\\" Hovannisian, Richard; The Armenian Genocide in Perspective, Page 142, Transaction Publishers, 1987 Tomb of Talaat Pasha in the cemetery of Monument of Liberty, Istanbul He was buried in the Turkish Cemetery in Berlin. In 1943, his remains were taken to Istanbul and reburied in ≈ûi≈üli. = Modern views = Talaat Pasha, Enver Pasha and Djemal Pasha are widely considered the main authors of the Armenian Genocide by historians.Alayaria, Aida; Consequences of Denial: The Armenian Genocide, Page 182, 2008, Karnac Books Ltd Historians have cited the influence of the Armenian Genocide on the Holocaust, which took place a few decades later. Records show the Nazis discussing and praising the Turkish model of extermination as early as the 1920s.the German interwar and Nazi discourses on the New Turkey, one finds a chilling propagation of what a post-genocidal country, one cleansed of its minorities, could achieve: To the Nazis, the New Turkey was something of a post-genocidal wonderland, something that Germany would have to emulate. The Nazis were discussing the Turkish model already in the early 1920s. A German- Jewish newspaper reader and critic of Anti-Semitism, Siegfried Lichtenstaedter, understood the \\"Turkish lessons\\" formulated in Nazi articles (in 1923 and 1924) to mean that the Jews of Germany and Austria should be, and had to be, killed and their property given to \\"Aryans.\\"\\"; Ihrig, Stefan; How the Armenian Genocide Shaped the Holocaust; 2016 Within modern Turkey, criticism also focuses on Talaat and the rest of the Three Pashas for causing the Ottoman Empire's entry into World War I and its subsequent partitioning by the Allies. Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk widely criticized Talaat Pasha and his colleagues for their policies during and immediately prior to the First World War. A multitude of streets in Turkey display his name, as well as a street in the city of Paphos in the Republic of Cyprus that contains a large Turkish minority.

He left Scunthorpe United on 1 June 1966 and then became manager for the New York Generals (appearing in one match)http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/G/Goodwin.Freddie.htm and Brighton & Hove Albion, before becoming manager of Second Division club Birmingham City. It was at Birmingham where he introduced the young Trevor Francis into league football. At Birmingham, he was also known for introducing yoga, psychological testing and other new training techniques. Goodwin also made 11 first-class appearances for Lancashire County Cricket Club (1955‚Äì1956) as a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Later life Goodwin later moved to the United States to coach and serve as president of the Minnesota Kicks. He later relocated to Washington state, where he coached Tacoma Stars and started a travel agency on Vashon Island. He died of cancer at Gig Harbor, Washington, on 19 February 2016 at the age of 82.

Built in the early 1970s, it remains one of two freeways (the other being the N1) linking Pretoria with Johannesburg, via the R24. As the eastern of the two freeways, it links the Pretoria city centre with OR Tambo International Airport, the N12 freeway, and Boksburg. Between the Solomon Mahlangu Drive on- ramp in Monument Park, Pretoria, and the N12 in Boksburg, the R21 / P157 is an 8 lane highway and motorway (freeway), with 4 lanes in each direction.\\"Engineering News, 26 March, 2010\\" It has off-ramps leading to Irene, Olifantsfontein, Benoni, and Kempton Park, including a partial offramp to Atlas Road. The route intersects the N1 Highway (Eastern Pretoria Bypass; Danie Joubert Freeway) near Centurion, the R24 near the airport, the N12 and N17 in Boksburg, and the N3 near Vosloorus on the East Rand, where it ends. The section from the N12 to the N3 is not a freeway. As early as the 1970s there were proposals to extend the R21 / P157 freeway further south and the freeway may be linked with the current eastern terminus of the M2 in Germiston in future. The R21 / P157 is the lowest \\"R\\" designated route number in South Africa, since numbers 1-18 have been reserved for national route numbers. However a portion of the R21 / P157 where is exists as a freeway, from Hans Strijdom Drive (now Solomon Mahlangu Drive) in Pretoria, to the N12 Freeway in the East Rand is both a National Road and a toll road, having been declared such in 2008, as part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, when it was also transferred to the South African National Roads Agency. The improvement project increased the number of lanes (previously, the freeway portion had been a dual carriageway freeway, with 2 lanes in each direction, from the Rietfontein Interchange to Pretoria), and installed lighting along the length of the freeway section. Route The R21 begins just north-east of Fountains Valley in Pretoria as Nelson Mandela Drive, at a roundabout intersection with the M18 Christina De Wit Avenue, M7, M5 and M3 Metropolitan roads of Pretoria, heading south-east. After Fountains Valley, the R21 passes by Monument Park. After Monument Park, the R21 becomes a National Road (it becomes an e-toll highway; with open road tolling), with the first off-ramp being the M10 Solomon Mahlangu Drive (formerly Hans Strijdom Drive) near the Waterkloof Airforce Base. It has Pretoria East to its east and Centurion to its west. Just after Solomon Mahlangu Drive, near the suburb of Pierre van Ryneveld Park, the R21 intersects with the N1 Highway (Danie Joubert Freeway; Pretoria Eastern Bypass), which is the freeway between Johannesburg and Polokwane. The Interchange is named the Flying Saucer Interchange. After The N1 Interchange, the R21 Freeway has 10 off-ramps and interchanges for the remaining length of its freeway section. It passes through various suburbs in various cities. The R21 intersects with the M31 (Irene Off-ramp), R562 (Olifantsfontein Off-ramp), R25 (Birchleigh/Tembisa Off-ramp), R23 (Benoni Off-ramp), M32 (Pomona Off- ramp), M43 (Atlas Off-ramp), M96 (Kempton Park Central Off-ramp), R24 (O.R. Tambo International Airport Interchange), M41 (Jet Park Off-ramp) and N12 (Rietfontein Interchange). After the M31 Irene off-ramp, the R21 leaves the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality and enters the City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. From the M31 Irene off-ramp up to just after the O.R. Tambo International Airport, the R21 is followed by the M57 Metropolitan Route of Johannesburg from north to south (which can be used as an alternative route to avoid being charged fees by the e-toll system or when there are roadworks on the highway). From the R562 off-ramp to the R25 off-ramp, the R21 bypasses the township of Tembisa. At the O.R. Tambo International Airport, south-east of Kempton Park Central, the R21 meets the R24 which connects the airport with Johannesburg Central in the west. Via the R24 (named the Albertina Sisulu Freeway), the R21 is the only freeway apart from the Ben Schoeman Freeway (designated as the N1) that links Pretoria with Johannesburg. North of Boksburg (just after the M41 Jet Park off-ramp), the R21 forms an interchange with the N12 Highway to Johannesburg in the west and Witbank (eMalahleni) in the east at the Rietfontein Interchange, which marks the end of the R21 being both a freeway and a toll road (e-toll highway). The R21 becomes Rietfontein Road when it junctions with the M44 Road at the next junction by East Rand Mall. Further south, at the suburb of Boksburg North, the R21 meets the M41 again and continues by way of a right turn at Rondebult Road. The R21 then meets the R29 (Cason Road) and continues south, bypassing Boksburg Central. After Boksburg Central, the R21 crosses the N17 Highway at Elspark and continues south through Sunward Park. After Sunward Park, the R21 heads south-south-east, meeting the R554 (North Boundary Road) and intersects the M43 Road (Barry Marais Road) for the second time at a t-junction in Dawn Park. The R21 and the M43 are co-signed south-west. As Bierman Road, the R21/M43 pass over the M35 Road (Germiston-Heidelberg Road), intersect with the R103, and end at Vosloorus at an intersection with the N3 Freeway (Johannesburg-Durban Highway). Albertina Sisulu Freeway As the R24 Freeway is known as the Albertina Sisulu Freeway in Ekurhuleni between Eastgate Shopping Centre and Johannesburg International Airport, the use of the name doesn't end there. The R21 is often also called the Albertina Sisulu Freeway, Particularly the section from the Johannesburg International Airport interchange north to the N1 Pretoria Eastern Bypass Flying Saucer interchange near Centurion and Pretoria in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality.https://allafrica.com/stories/200708300800.html It indicates that the R21 from Pretoria to the airport and the R24 from there to Bedfordview are together known as the Albertina Sisulu Freeway. The naming of the R24 Highway from Bedfordview eastwards, together with the R21 freeway from OR Tambo International Airport northwards to Pretoria as the Albertina Sisulu Freeway was already done by the time of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Also, the R21 extension from OR Tambo International Airport to the N12 Interchange north of Boksburg may be counted as being part of the Albertina Sisulu Freeway.

Purdue University Press. 2009. p. 177  Life and career  Gorgolewski was born in Solec (Schulitz), Grand Duchy of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1866 and 1871 he studied in Berlin at the Royal Building Academy. During his studies, Gorgolewski also supervised the construction of Lehrte Train Station in Berlin. After graduating, for six years he worked as an assistant in his alma mater. After that he became an advisor at the Prussian Ministry of Public Works, official royal palace architect and architecture inspector (K√∂niglicher Regierungsbaumeister) in Halle upon Saale. Piotr Marek Sta≈Ñski - Zygmunt Gorgolewski, tw√≥rca gmachu Lwowskiego Teatru Wielkiego Gorgolewski was one of the most notable supporters of historicism in architecture in the Kingdom of Prussia and then the German Empire. Bad Oeynhausen: Bathhouse IV (now II), 1883-1885 by Zygmunt Gorgolewski Among his projects were two versions of the future Reichstag building, which he proposed in 1872 and then in 1882. His projects were among merely 20 chosen by the committee out of more than 100. However, in the end his ideas for these projects were refused. At the same time, Gorgolewski was awarded with the construction of Kaiser Wilhelm's Bridge. Other, more successful, projects include the plans of refurbishment of royal palaces in Berlin and in Kiel, expansion of University Hospitals in Halle upon Saale and Bonn, the Bathhouse IV (1883-1885, now numbered II) of Bad Oeynhausen spa in Westphalia.Cf. Badehaus II im Kurpark, Bad Oeynhausen, retrieved on 10 April 2020. In addition, he contributed plans for the projected new construction of the Berlin Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, and worked on renovating Bellevue Palace, and created as main architect courthouses in Opole (Oppeln) and Olsztyn (Allenstein), as well as prisons in ≈öwidnica (Schweidnitz) and Chorz√≥w (K√∂nigsh√ºtte). In the Greater Poland region, Gorgolewski conducted the construction of many notable palaces both in and around Pozna≈Ñ. His works include: * refurbishment of a church in Wrze≈õnia * refurbishment of Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski family palace in Go≈Çuch√≥w * refurbishment of Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski family library in K√≥rnik * construction of Twardowski family palace in KobylnikiKrystyna Siemiatycka.

He was also appointed as the main architect of the refurbishment of the palace of Ferdynand Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in O≈Çyka, Volhynia. During his stay there, Gorgolewski for the first time visited Vilnius, Krak√≥w, Kiev and Lviv. The latter city enjoyed a period of fast expansion and in 1875 Gorgolewski took part in the contest for the project of the future Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria. His project was the most disputed and highly praised, but it was finally turned down, mostly due to financial reasons. In 1879, Gorgolewski married Helena n√©e Hulewicz. He was also an active member of many architectural juries across partitioned Poland. Among others, he was the member of the jury during the contest for the project of Krak√≥w Old Theatre (1889),‚ÄûPreisangaben‚Äú, in: Deutsche Bauzeitung, No. 9 (30 January 1889), vol. XXIII, p. 60. the bank in Czerniowce and Church of St. Elizabeth in Lviv. In 1893 he moved to Lviv, where he was chosen as the main architect of the Grand Theatre (1897‚Äì1900). To avoid being accused of using his well-established position in society, Gorgolewski prepared his winning project of the theatre in secret and then sent it under a false name from Leipzig. Other notable building of his authorship was the Industrial School in the same city. Gorgolewski died in Lviv and was buried in the Lychakiv Cemetery.

The concept is named for ultrasonic dog whistles used in shepherding. Dog whistles use language which appears normal to the majority, but which communicate specific things to intended audiences. They are generally used to convey messages on issues likely to provoke controversy without attracting negative attention. One example may be use of a phrase such as family values to signal to Christians that a candidate would support policies promoting Christian values, without alienating non-Christian supporters. (quoting: \\"[R]eligious appeals that signal particular faith communities may not be persuasive. Indeed, people may even develop more negative attitudes towards a politician who makes an overt religious appeal when it is clear that they are not part of the ingroup.\\" and, later, \\"Given that there is religious diversity in the United States, the unique appeal of multivocal language is that it allows politicians to speak directly to like- minded others, communicating to them common ground and shared values, while those who do not share this perspective remain oblivious.\\") Accusations of dog whistling are, by their nature, hard to prove and may be false. One example may be the use of the phrase 'international banks' to signal to racists that a candidate is antisemitic without alienating non-racist supporters. Some argue that the concept is too vague and prone to false accusations. University of Arizona linguist Robert Henderson and Gakuin University linguist Elin McCready argue that plausible deniability is a key characteristic of dog whistles. Harvard linguist Steven Pinker writes \\"Dogwhistling is an intriguing exegetical technique in which you can claim that anyone says anything because you can easily hear the alleged dogwhistles that aren't in the actual literal contents of what the person says. I think that you could replace dogwhistle with auditory hallucination and the accusation would be exactly the same.\\" Origin and meaning According to William Safire, the term \\"dog whistle\\" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of opinion polling. Safire quotes Richard Morin, director of polling for The Washington Post, as writing in 1988, > \\"subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different > results ... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear > something in the question that researchers do not\\". He speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters. In her 2006 book, Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia, academic Amanda Lohrey writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example politicians choosing broadly appealing words such as \\"family values\\", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters. Australian political theorist Robert E. Goodin argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is \\"democratically meaningless\\" and does not give the dog-whistler a policy mandate. History and usage =Australia= The term was first picked up in Australian politics in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of John Howard.Grant Barrett, The official dictionary of unofficial English, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90 Throughout his 11 years as Australian prime minister and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious Australian voters using code words such as \\"un-Australian\\", \\"mainstream\\", and \\"illegals\\". One notable example was the Howard government's message on refugee arrivals. His government's tough stance on immigration was popular with voters, but was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings, while maintaining plausible deniability by avoiding overtly racist language. Another example was the publicity of the Australian citizenship test in 2007. It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions. =Canada= During the 2015 Canadian federal election, the Conservative party led by incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper was accused of communicating \\"code\\" words in a debate to appeal to his party's base supporters. Midway through the election campaign the Conservative Party hired Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby as a political adviser when they fell to third place in the polls behind the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party. During a televised election debate Stephen Harper, while discussing the government's controversial decision to remove certain immigrants and refugee claimants from accessing Canada's health care system made reference to 'Old Stock Canadians' as being in support of the government's position. Opposition leaders, including former Quebec Liberal MP Marlene Jennings, called his words racist and divisive, as they are used to exclude Canadians of colour. =United Kingdom= Lynton Crosby, who had previously managed John Howard's four election campaigns in Australia, worked as a Conservative Party adviser during the 2005 UK general election, and the term was introduced to British political discussion at this time. In what Goodin calls \\"the classic case\\" of dog- whistling, Crosby created a campaign for the Conservatives with the slogan \\"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\\": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like \\"It's not racist to impose limits on immigration\\" and \\"how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?\\" focused on controversial issues like insanitary hospitals, land grabs by squatters and restraints on police behaviour. Labour MP Diane Abbott described the 2013 \\"Go Home\\" vans advertising campaign by the British Home Office as an example of dog-whistle politics. In April 2016, Mayor of London and Conservative MP Boris Johnson was accused of \\"dog whistle racism\\" by Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and Labour MP John McDonnell when Johnson suggested U.S. President Barack Obama held a grudge against the United Kingdom due to his \\"ancestral dislike of the British Empire\\" as a result of his \\"part-Kenyan\\" heritage, after Obama expressed his support for the UK to vote to remain in the European Union ahead of the UK's referendum on EU membership. In the 2016 London Mayoral Election, Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith was accused of running a dog-whistle campaign against Labour's Sadiq Khan, playing on Khan's Muslim faith by suggesting he would target Hindus and Sikhs with a \\"jewellery tax\\" and attempting to link him to extremists. Theresa May was accused of dog-whistle politics during the run up to the UK leaving the European Union, after claiming EU citizens were 'jumping the queue'. The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of tolerating \\"dog-whistle\\" anti-Semitism in the party since he took the lead of the party. =United States= The phrase \\"states' rights\\", literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described in 2007 by David Greenberg in Slate as \\"code words\\" for institutionalized segregation and racism. States' rights was the banner under which groups like the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties argued in 1955 against school desegregation. In 1981, former Republican Party strategist Lee Atwater, when giving an anonymous interview discussing Nixon's Southern Strategy, said: Atwater was contrasting this with Ronald Reagan's campaign, which he felt \\"was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference.\\" However, Ian Haney L√≥pez, an American law professor and author of the 2014 book Dog Whistle Politics, described Reagan as \\"blowing a dog whistle\\" when the candidate told stories about \\"Cadillac- driving 'welfare queens' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with food stamps\\" while he was campaigning for the presidency.Full Show: Ian Haney L√≥pez on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I. Moyers & Company, February 28, 2014. He argues that such rhetoric pushes middle-class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish \\"undeserving minorities\\" who, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to L√≥pez, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, union busting, cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s. Journalist Craig Unger wrote that President George W. Bush and Karl Rove used coded \\"dog-whistle\\" language in political campaigning, delivering one message to the overall electorate while at the same time delivering quite a different message to a targeted evangelical Christian political base. William Safire, in Safire's Political Dictionary, offered the example of Bush's criticism during the 2004 presidential campaign of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision denying the U.S. citizenship of any African American. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but \\"sharp-eared observers\\" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade. This view is echoed in a 2004 Los Angeles Times article by Peter Wallsten. During the 2008 Democratic primaries, writer Enid Lynette Logan criticized Hillary Clinton's campaign's reliance on code words and innuendo seemingly designed to frame Barack Obama's race as problematic, saying Obama was characterized by the Clinton campaign and its prominent supporters as anti-white due to his association with Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as able to attract only black votes, as anti-patriotic, a drug user, possibly a drug seller, and married to an angry, ungrateful black woman. In 2012, journalist Soledad O'Brien used the phrase \\"dog whistle\\" to describe Tea Party Express representative Amy Kremer's accusation that Obama \\"does not love America\\". Also in that election cycle, Obama's campaign ran an ad in Ohio that said Mitt Romney was \\"not one of us\\". Washington Post journalist Karen Tumulty wrote, \\"ironically, it echoes a slogan that has been used as a racial code over at least the past half-century.\\" During the 2014 Republican senate primary in Mississippi, a scandal emerged with politicians accused of attempting to influence the public by using such code words as \\"food stamps\\". Senator Ted Cruz called for an investigation, saying that \\"the ads they ran were racially-charged false attacks\\". During the 2016 presidential election campaign and on a number of occasions throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has been accused of using racial and anti-Semitic \\"dog whistling\\" techniques by politicians and major news outlets.

Dick: A Life 1928-1963, Long Beach, Ca.: Fragments West/The Valentine Press, p.389 Plot After experiencing a terrifying explosion, a middle-class American family finds their home in the middle of a wasteland. American soldiers burst in looking for survivors and supplies, under the family's amazed and frightened eyes. The soldiers are just as surprised, finding the home filled with items that are no longer available, and carrying away their food. The soldiers explain that their home is one of the few to survive the ongoing nuclear war, which is now largely automated with underground factories on both sides of the conflict building missiles and destroying the other country square by square. The soldiers and family soon realize the home is out of its own time continuum, apparently having been blasted into the future by the force of the bombs. They find that the date is not long in the future; the war starts shortly after the time they left. The soldiers tell the family a second wave of missiles will be arriving, intended to destroy anything that survived the first wave, and offer to take the family into a shelter. After some discussion, they refuse, considering it better to chance that the second wave will blast them back to their own time than live in this largely lifeless future. The gambit succeeds and the family finds themselves in their own time, but with their house destroyed. Neighbors rush to the home, where the father, Tim McLean, agrees that the problem was an exploding central heating system. Then he comments, \\"I should have got it fixed ... I should have had it looked at a long time ago. Before it got in such bad shape ... before it was too late\\", a metaphor for the start of the war which may now be avoidable.

He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name as Deuce. The son of professional wrestler Jimmy Snuka, Reiher began wrestling in the late 1990s, and worked for the UWA and the Xcitement Wrestling Federation. After signing a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Reiher was assigned to WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky in 2005, where he wrestled under the name Deuce Shade. He was placed in tag team competition, alongside Dice Domino. Along with their manager Cherry, the group were known as The Throw-Backs and later The Untouchable, and captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. Deuce also won the OVW Television Championship on one occasion in singles competition. The group was called up to the SmackDown! roster in January 2007, and underwent a name change to Deuce 'n Domino. Three months later, Deuce 'n Domino won the WWE Tag Team Championship. After dropping the title in August 2007, the group disbanded in June 2008. Deuce moved to the Raw brand and became known as Sim Snuka, and the following year, on June 19, 2009, he was released from his WWE contract. Professional wrestling career =Early career= After deciding to become a professional wrestler, Reiher trained with his father, Jimmy Snuka in New Jersey. He then began working under the ring name Solo in the UWA in California. During his time in UWA, he was offered a contract by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), but turned it down in favor of a more lucrative contract from UWA. After the UWA went out of business in late 2001, Reiher began working for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), a promotion run by Jimmy Hart, The Nasty Boys, and Greg Valentine. In XWF, he used the name Jimmy Snuka Jr. and was managed by his father. He appeared at the first round of XWF tapings in November 2001, defeating Buddy Lee Parker and Vapor in two separate matches. =World Wrestling Entertainment= Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005‚Äì2009) Reiher made his debut in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) on January 27, 2005 as Deuce Shade, defeating Brent Albright. On May 24, 2005, he defeated Chad Wicks in an OVW Television Championship tournament match. He later went on to beat Ken Doane in the tournament finals for the OVW Television Championship on June 7. He ended up losing it to Doane later that month. On August 24, Shade won a number one contenders battle royal to earn the right to face OVW Champion Johnny Jeter later that night, but he lost this match. In January 2006, Shade started teaming with Dice Domino, calling themselves \\"The Throw-Backs\\". It was at this time that Cherry Pie began accompanying them to the ring, as their valet. They later changed their name to \\"The Untouchables\\", and removed the Shade, Dice, and Pie parts of their respective names. On March 19, Reiher defeated Mike Mizanin to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship for his team. The team lost their titles on April 5, in a three-way match to Roadkill and K.C James; the match also involved Kenny and Mikey of the Spirit Squad. In mid-August 2006, The Untouchables quickly became embroiled in a scripted rivalry with Cody Runnels and Shawn Spears over the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. Runnels and Spears captured the title from The Untouchables on October 18. In November 2006, Runnels and Spears defeated The Untouchables in a tag team match, and won the services of their valet, Cherry. On November 29, the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship was vacated after a match between The Untouchables and Runnels and Spears ended in a draw. The following week, a rematch between the two teams was held for the vacant championship. During this match Cherry turned on Spears and Runnels, re-joining The Untouchables and helping them regain the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. Two weeks later, on December 20, Runnels and Spears defeated The Untouchables in a Street Fight to win the championship. SmackDown! (2007‚Äì2008) Deuce (left) with Domino before a match on a SmackDown! taping On the January 19, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, the team, now using the name \\"Deuce 'n Domino\\", along with Cherry, debuted with their 1950s greaser in-ring persona. They quickly defeated a team of jobbers‚Äîwrestlers who consistently lose to make their opponents look stronger‚Äîand did the same to another jobber team the next week. On the February 2 episode of SmackDown!, they defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a non-title match. They earned a chance at the championship at No Way Out, but failed to win the title. On the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Deuce and Domino got a chance at the tag titles again, but lost after Deuce got them disqualified. The next week on SmackDown!, they defeated London and Kendrick to win the tag team titles. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor, but Deuce and Domino interfered, resulting in Regal and Taylor being disqualified. This made both teams the number one contender, which led to a triple threat tag match the next week where Deuce and Domino retained the titles. On June 24, Deuce and Domino issued an open challenge at the pay-per- view event, Vengeance, which was accepted by Jimmy Snuka (Deuce's father) and Sgt. Slaughter. Deuce and Domino retained their title. On the June 29 episode of SmackDown!, Domino suffered an injury during a match with Cryme Tyme, sidelining him for a month. After Domino's return, the team began a scripted rivalry with Batista and Ric Flair. On the August 31 episode of SmackDown!, he and Domino lost their tag team title to Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Matt Hardy. They engaged in a rivalry with MVP and Hardy, and attempted to regain their championship, but were unsuccessful. Throughout late 2007 and early 2008, Deuce 'n Domino wrestled sporadically, facing teams such as Jimmy Wang Yang and Shannon Moore, Jesse and Festus, and Finlay and Hornswoggle. On the May 23 episode of SmackDown, Deuce and Domino parted ways with Cherry and replaced her with WWE Diva Maryse. After a series of losses, Deuce attacked Domino on the June 20, 2008 episode of SmackDown to end their partnership. Repackaging (2008‚Äì2009) As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand. He made his debut for the brand on the September 22 airing of Raw, losing to Santino Marella. On the December 15, 2008 episode of Raw, Deuce announced that his new ring name would be \\"Sim Snuka\\", after revealing his father is Jimmy Snuka, and faced Rey Mysterio in a losing attempt; after Mysterio fell into Cody Rhodes and Manu, who were at ringside, they attacked Mysterio, and the match ended in a disqualification. Two weeks later, he defeated Charlie Haas (who was dressed as Snuka's father) to pass step one towards earning a spot in Randy Orton's Legacy faction. A week later, Snuka teamed with Rhodes against Cryme Tyme, with Rhodes getting the pinfall. It was revealed after the match that only the man who got the pinfall would advance into the group, leaving Snuka out. He, along with Manu, brought back Ted DiBiase to help them attack The Legacy, only to be betrayed and attacked by DiBiase, Orton and Rhodes. Following this, Snuka appeared rarely. His last WWE appearance was at WrestleMania XXV, where he posed as an unnamed cameraman during the match between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, and failed to catch The Undertaker during a suicide dive spot during the bout. He was released from his WWE contract on June 19, 2009. =National Wrestling Alliance (2009)= In November, Snuka began to appear on promotional posters for shows in the NWA-Southwest and Phoenix regions, now under the name 'Simm Snuka'. On November 28, 2009 he made his debut for NWA, teaming with his father Jimmy Snuka to defeat Hellcat and Triple X at NWA New York Raging Gladiator Wrestling III.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1148&page;=4 On November 30, he made a challenge to Blue Demon Jr. for a shot at his NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match in Texas at the NWA Southwest Anniversary Show. However the match never occurred. On December 12, Snuka defeated GQ Gallo at another NWA branded event. =Independent circuit (2009‚Äì2017)= On October 24, 2009, Snuka and Lawrence Tyler defeated Devon Willis and Sonny Samson. After not wrestling for four years he returned to face Graves for the Championship Wrestling from Arizona Heavyweight Title. Snuka would win the match but not return to the promotion. The following year his only match was at a NWA/UCW event where he would be on the winning team of a six-man tag match alongside his father, it would be his last time teaming with him before his father's death. In 2017 his final match to date was competing in a Battle Royal for the APWA promotion. Personal life Prior to getting in the wrestling business, Reiher worked as a youth counselor and a TV cameraman in Utah. Reiher is a former Mr. Hawaiian Islands in bodybuilding. Reiher is a second generation wrestler; his father James Reiher wrestled using the name Jimmy Snuka. Reiher's sister Sarona works for WWE as \\"Tamina\\".

Etymology  The word hosanna (Latin ', Greek , h≈çsann√°) is from Hebrew , ' and related to Aramaic ( æ≈çsha ønƒÅ) meaning 'save, rescue, savior'.Oxford English Dictionary and Bauer lexicon In the Hebrew Bible it is used only in verses such as \\"help\\" or \\"save, I pray\\" (). In that context, the word Hosanna seems to be a \\"special kind of respect\\" given to the one who saves, saved, will save or is saving now. If so Hosanna means 'a special honor to the one who saves'. The old interpretation \\"Save, now!\\",See ArtScroll Siddur, p. 727. based on Psalm 118:25, does not fully explain the occurrence of the word in the Gospels as a shout of jubilation, and this has given rise to complex discussions.See the articles and more especially  Liturgical use in different traditions  In a liturgical context, it refers to a cry expressing an appeal for divine help.Friberg Lexicon = Judaism = In Jewish liturgy, the word is applied specifically to the Hoshana Service, a cycle of prayers from which a selection is sung each morning during Sukkot, the Feast of Booths or Tabernacles. The complete cycle is sung on the seventh day of the festival, which is called Hoshana Rabbah (◊î◊ï◊©◊¢◊†◊ê ◊®◊ë◊ê, \\"Great Hosanna\\").See ArtScroll Siddur, p. 726; so also in Syrian usage. In Judaism, it is always used in its original Hebrew form, ◊î◊ï◊©◊¢◊†◊ê Hoshana. = Christianity = \\"Hosanna\\" was the shout of praise or adoration made in recognition of the Messiahship of Jesus on his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, \\"Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the LORD!\\"; ; . It is used in the same way in Christian praise. It is applied in numerous verses of the New Testament, including \\"Hosanna; blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord\\" (); \\"hosanna in the highest\\" (); and \\"hosanna to the Son of David\\" (). The \\"Hosanna Anthem\\",The Moravian Hymn Book with Services (authorized for use in the British Province of the Moravian Church), 1960 based on the phrase Hosanna, is a traditional Moravian Church anthem written by Bishop Christian Gregor of Herrnhut sung on Palm Sunday and the first Sunday of Advent. It is antiphonal, i.e. a call-and-response song; traditionally, it is sung between the children and adult congregation, though it is not unheard of for it to be done in other ways, such as between choir and congregation, or played between trombone choirs. Many songs for church use bear the title \\"Hosanna\\", including songs written by New Zealand singer Brooke Fraser Ligertwood (released on the 2007 Hillsong United albums All of the Above and live on Saviour King and covered by the Canadian group Starfield on their album I Will Go); another song by Paul Baloche on his 2006 album A Greater Song; another by gospel artist Kirk Franklin, and another by Andrew Peterson on his 2008 album Resurrection Letters II. Sidney Mohede's \\"Hosanna (Be Lifted High)\\" was included on Israel Houghton's 2011 Grammy Award-winning album Love God, Love People. In the Philippines, particularly in Tagalog- speaking provinces, the term _Osanahan_ refers to the procession of the priest from a prayer station (termed _kub√≥l_ or _Galilea_ in some provinces) after the blessing of palms; to the parish church for the liturgy of the Mass of the Sunday of the Lord's Passion. This procession is accompanied by the faithful, with children dressed as angels singing Filipino or Latin antiphons set into lowland Filipino music, with either a rondalla or a brass band as musical accompaniment.Zialcita, F., et al. Cuaresma. Bookman. Manila. 1997 Other examples of modern usage Architect Frank Lloyd Wright famously used the word in his exclamation \\"Hosanna! A client!\\" after securing a commission, breaking a long, dry spell. In the 1969 Broadway musical 1776 the word is used repeatedly as part of the chorus of the song \\"Cool, Cool, Considerate Men.\\" \\"Hosanna\\" is the name of one of the songs featured in the 1971 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. The song covers the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, as in the above Biblical passages. Jesus is briefly harassed by the high priest Caiaphas but the people celebrate him as the Messiah. There is also a reprise of the chorus when Jesus is sent to King Herod. A. R. Rahman composed the song \\"Hosanna\\" for the 2010 Tamil movie Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. Here the word is used as an exclamation of joy when a man sees his beloved. The Christian Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) objected to this song and asked film-makers Fox Star Studios to remove it from the final cut of the Hindi remake of the film, Ekk Deewana Tha. Paul McCartney's album New, released in 2013, features a song titled Hosanna. Contextually, he uses the phrase as a cry for help in light of the world's current state of affairs.

Alongside Matt Cappotelli, he won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, and also won the OVW Heavyweight Championship in singles competition. Jeter became part of the Spirit Squad and debuted on Raw in January 2006. They won the World Tag Team Championship once. After being released from WWE, he returned to OVW. He retired, but returned to the ring in 2019.  Professional wrestling career  = Ohio Valley Wrestling (2001‚Äì2005) = After being trained by Nick Dinsmore, Jeter debuted in 2001, and began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In 2003, he signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and continued to wrestle in OVW, which was WWE's developmental territory, although he occasionally made appearances in dark matches for WWE. In one of his earliest dark matches, Jeter teamed with Nova in a loss to Chuck Palumbo and Nunzio on the February 23, 2003 episode of Velocity. His pay-per-view debut was at the 2003 Vengeance event, when Jeter appeared as the masked Conquistador #2 in the APA's Barroom Brawl match. In 2004, Jeter formed a tag team with Matt Cappotelli known as the Thrillseekers. The Thrillseekers wrestled in several dark matches before both Raw and SmackDown, defeating the teams of Johnny Nitro and Chris Cage, and MNM. On January 19, 2005, The Thrillseekers defeated MNM to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. They successfully defended the championship against MNM and The Heart Throbs, before losing it to the Blond Bombers (Tank and Chad Toland) on April 6. On July 27, The Thrillseekers defeated MNM to become the number one contenders to the Tag Team Championship, in a match with the added stipulation that whoever gained the pin would receive a match for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. The Thrillseekers got simultaneous pins, but it was Jeter who received the championship match. On August 3, Jeter defeated the OVW Heavyweight Champion, Brent Albright, to win the championship, after Ken Anderson and Daniel Puder interfered on his behalf. After the match, Jeter turned into a heel (villainous character) by attacking Cappotelli, who had suffered an injury. In the following weeks, Jeter also attacked Albright, announcer Dean Hill, and official Danny Davis. Jeter quickly formed an alliance with Ken Anderson, who helped him retain the championship on several occasions. They later added Paul Burchill to the alliance as an enforcer. After holding the OVW Heavyweight Championship for five months, Jeter lost it to Cappotelli in a two out of three falls match on November 9, 2005. Jeter challenged Cappotelli on numerous occasions Cappotelli in an attempt to regain the championship, but was unsuccessful. = The Spirit Squad (2006) = In OVW, he became a part of The Spirit Squad, a faction using the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, using the name \\"Johnny\\". On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry Lawler by distracting Lawler and performing cheers for Coachman. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The heel (villainous) McMahon brought in The Spirit Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches. They also wrestled in the tag team division and on Raw on April 3, The Spirit Squad won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey, with outside help from the other three members, defeated Kane and The Big Show. After winning the championship, all five members of The Spirit Squad were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship. In May, McMahon signed another handicap match, with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The Spirit Squad instead attacked Michaels before the match started, and Triple H came out to help The Spirit Squad. Triple H felt disrespected by The Spirit Squad however, and as a result, helped Michaels instead. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with The Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on The Spirit Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII. At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, The Spirit Squad also wrestled other teams in Raw's tag division over their World Tag Team Championship, successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay-per-view in September. The Spirit Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with Johnny, Mikey, and Mitch losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw. After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme, Kenny announced that he was going to defeat Flair, and was successful with the help of the other members. It was then announced that Flair and a legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Roddy Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship. The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of Raw, when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped \\"OVW, Louisville, Kentucky\\", a reference to the developmental territory from where The Spirit Squad had come. Following the breakup of The Spirit Squad, Johnny became the second member of the team to return to the main roster when he appeared during a 30-man battle royal on the December 18 episode of Raw, wearing new wrestling attire. = Return to developmental territories (2007‚Äì2008) = Jeter made his return to OVW on February 14, 2007, by defeating Deuce in a dark match prior to the television tapings.

From 1858 to 1864 he served as a pastor‚Äîfirst in Quincy, Massachusetts, then in Salem‚Äîand served as a chaplain of the 40th Massachusetts Volunteers in the Civil War. After the war, he returned to Massachusetts to become Professor of Sacred Literature at Andover Theological Seminary, where he taught until 1882. In 1884, he began teaching New Testament criticism at Harvard. In 1870, Thayer was a member of the American Bible Revision Committee and recording secretary of the New Testament company (working on the Revised Version). Thayer's Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon is a revised and translated edition of C.G. Wilke's Clavis Novi Testamenti - first published in 1841. After numerous revisions by both Wilke and his successor, C.L. Wilibald Grimm, Thayer took over the project. Thayer devoted nearly thirty years to the translation that first appeared in 1885, and updated edition in 1889. In February 1891 Thayer published a lecture in which he expressed disagreement with the position of Biblical inerrancy, asserting that his own acceptance of various errors of history and science in the Bible did not materially detract from his belief in the overall soundness of Christianity. Thayer was president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis for 1894 and 1895.

Two series, both written by Steven Moffat, were broadcast on BBC1 in 1997. Like Moffat's earlier sitcom Joking Apart, Chalk was produced by Andre Ptaszynski for Pola Jones. The series focuses upon deputy headteacher Eric Slatt (David Bamber), permanently stressed over the chaos he creates both by himself and some of his eccentric staff. His wife Janet (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and new English teacher Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) attempt to help him solve the problems. Because of the very good reaction of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008. Production =Inception= Steven Moffat left his job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost and changes in the executive structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series.Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha, \\"The Big Finish?\\" Press Gang: Series 2 DVD audio commentary, Network DVD As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gang's primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead.Andre Ptaszynski and Steven Moffat, Joking Apart, Series 2, Episode 1 DVD audio commentary, ReplayDVD That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: \\"I don't think you have an alternative to writing about what you know. You've no life experience to go on other than your own. Even if you're writing something you think is entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close to your own experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability.\\" After the second series of Joking Apart had been transmitted, Ptaszynski revived Moffat's original idea about a sitcom set in a school.After the Chalk Dust Settled, featurette on Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD.co.uk, prod. & dir. Craig Robins In an article for The Guardian newspaper, writer and comedian Richard Herring observed that Moffat has not used the show \\"as a soapbox from which to satirise the government‚Äôs educational policy, preferring to concentrate on being funny ... yet beneath it all is a much more broadly satirical swipe at the implicit pointlessness of the way we are educated.\\" For this article, Moffat told Herring: > Secondary School is a big waste of time. What are French teachers doing? > None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any > history? What is the point in training people to do things that none of us > can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil > Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be > quite handy. Moffat discussed similar institutional and political issues with The Independent: > Staffrooms are funny places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a > tremendous sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. > They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. > They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they > are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former > pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. > He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s > he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World. The Independent reported that Moffat \\"stresses that Chalk is a sitcom, not some banner-waving, agitprop pamphlet\\", but is still \\"passionate about education\\". Moffat criticises \\"the [Conservative] government talk about the specially talented needing more education, but that's absurd, the equivalent of hospitals for the healthy.\\" Moffat expected that teachers would find the show funny because it \\"has certain notes of accuracy\\", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that teachers would \\"also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' but I hope they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. Why take it seriously?' You couldn't claim it is the most flattering series, but, there again, people continued to stay at hotels after Fawlty Towers.\\" As with Joking Apart, Ptaszynski produced Chalk for independent production company Pola Jones. The positive reaction of the studio audience during recording of the first series in 1996 propelled executives to commission a second set of six episodes before the first batch had aired. =Recording= Filming outside of Acland Burghley School for the documentary for the DVD release of series one. This part of the school is seen in the show's opening titles. All of the location shots for Chalk were filmed at the beginning of the production block. Acland Burghley School, in the Tufnell Park area of Camden, London, provided the exterior of the fictional Galfast High. The cast recall that it was difficult to perform comedy on location without a studio audience to gauge the reception and success of the jokes. Another school near Wembley was used for large interior shots, such as the school hall featured in the episode \\"The Inspection\\". Rehearsals took place in BBC premises in Acton, west London, colloquially known by those in the industry as the \\"Acton Hilton\\". David Bamber, his colleagues note, knew the script at the beginning of rehearsals and never dropped a line.\\"Suzy Arrives\\", DVD audio commentary, Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD The cast recall that director Juliet May provided a calm working environment; rather than losing her temper when things went wrong, she instead focussed everyone's mind on how to solve the problem. After the exterior shots had been filmed, the episodes were recorded at BBC Television Centre in London. Most of the episodes were recorded in studios three or four, but occasionally the larger studio eight was used. After a week's rehearsals, the episodes were filmed on Sundays. The cast and crew would have a camera rehearsal followed by a dress run. After a supper, the cast were introduced to the studio audience. The studio audience responded very positively to the show during recordings. However, Moffat reflects that the show's style was not suited to the home audience. In a 2012 interview, he says: > Of any sitcom I‚Äôve ever witnessed being made, and I‚Äôve seen loads of them > like Men Behaving Badly and The Vicar of Dibley, Chalk had the biggest > laughs on the night. As a piece of theatre it was brilliant in the studio ‚Äì > people came back every week; the audiences were rapturous. The trouble was > when I watched the tape at home, it was far too loud and raucous [for TV]. The BBC commissioned a second series based on the studio audience reactions during recordings. As development on series two had reached a relatively late stage when the first had received negative reviews upon transmission, it was too late to cancel the production. The cast and crew, then, had to work on a show which they knew was widely disliked. Moffat reflects on the experience: \\"There's no feeling on earth like working on a show that you know is doomed and already tanking.\\" BBC executives insisted that the title be changed as they felt that \\"Chalk\\" did not stand out in the schedules. They were also concerned that the title might be somewhat anachronistic because schools were beginning to use whiteboards rather than blackboards. Many people, including the actors, attempted to think of alternatives, but instead reverted to \\"Chalk\\". Funding was running low towards the end of filming the first series. Moffat contrived an episode, \\"The Staff Meeting\\", where all of the main cast would be locked in the staff room to avoid paying for any guest actors. To reduce expenditure further, crew members were enlisted to provide the voices for the television news report at the end of the episode: producer Andre Ptaszynski played the broadcast journalist, whilst second assistant director Sarah Daman voiced the protesting student Gail Bennett. When a guest actor delivered an inadequate performance of the psychiatric doctor at the end of \\"The Inspection\\", Moffat coached assistant director Stacey Adair to perform the line. However, professional actor C.J. Allen lived near to the location and he was enlisted to deliver the line instead.\\"The Inspection\\", DVD audio commentary, Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD The expense and restrictions placed upon child actors limited the number of pupils that could be featured. The non-speaking extras had to be licensed, a process that took four weeks, providing difficulties for assistant director Stacey Adair.\\"Both Called Eric\\", DVD audio commentary, Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD The episode \\"Both Called Eric\\" features Antony Costa as one of the pupils, one of his earliest TV roles before going on to appear in Grange Hill and in the boy band Blue. Episodes The sitcom is based at the fictional comprehensive school Galfast High. It begins with the arrival of the young new English teacher Suzie Travis (Nicola Walker). She immediately encounters the chaos of the school, a chaos enhanced by the manic Deputy Head Eric Slatt (David Bamber). The Guardian retrospectively commented that the show's \\"best episodes of ... manouevred their unwitting participants towards a climax of terrible sexual humiliation or violence.\\" Moffat integrated many references to secondary characters and locations from his previous BAFTA winning show Press Gang into Chalk. For instance, the Chalk character Eric Slatt refers to his neighbouring school Norbridge High, run by Mr Sullivan: these were the names of the school and deputy headmaster in Press Gang. The scene where Slatt is being given instructions by wire is taken from the unfilmed Press Gang movie Dead Line. The pornographic video Lesbian Spank Inferno, owned by Dan McGill in the final episode, is later referenced in the Coupling episode \\"Inferno\\". In an interview with The New York Times, Moffat admitted that the video is inspired by his then-new partner, Sue Vertue, finding a similar video in their VCR. Characters Eric Slatt (David Bamber) is the deputy headmaster of Galfast High, who seems to \\"deepen the many crises that face the school (most of Slatt‚Äôs own making)\\". Jeff Evans, writing in The Penguin TV Companion, observed that \\"Slatt is certainly keen, but regrettably he is also unbalanced, tactless, clumsy, snobby, sarcastic, at times pointlessly aggressive and always prone to appalling errors of judgment (an academic version of Basil Fawlty, it was widely noted)\\". The Independent commented: \\"Chalk is in the idiom of sadistic farce: disaster begets catastrophe begets apocalypse, and they all engulf Slatt. There are inevitable echoes of other sitcom characters - a dash of Basil Fawlty's unquenchable apoplexy, a slice of Gordon Brittas's purblind monomania - but Slatt's entanglements are caused by his own cocktail of failings.\\" Nicola Walker commented that viewers sympathise with Slatt because he is in charge of a bunch of lunatics. Moffat told The Herald that Slatt was inspired by a real person: > My main character, the deputy head, is a manic git, and he's based on a guy > I never actually met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had > already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from > his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him > with the affectionate disdain of anyone who has been married for more than a > year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted > would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short > of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real > man is actually a very nice bloke. Ptaszynski had attempted to persuade his friend Angus Deayton, who wanted to move into more acting roles away from Have I Got News for You, to play Slatt. The producer reflects that Deayton would have brought a more \\"sardonic\\" element to the character. The cast regularly teased David Bamber during rehearsals, speculating upon how Deayton might have performed a particular line or sequence. Janet Slatt (Geraldine Fitzgerald) is Eric's wife and the school's secretary. She has an antagonistic relationship with Eric, with each regularly the butt of the other's jokes. For instance, Eric suggests one morning that she had not shaved, and that she should rest her hind legs. Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) is a new English teacher who arrives at the school in the first episode.\\"Suzy Arrives\\", Chalk, 20 February 1997, BBC 1, wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Juliet May The press described Suzy as \\"the voice of sanity at Galfast High and the thorn in Slatt's side.\\" Amanda Trippley (Amanda Boxer) is the neurotic music teacher. Throughout the series, she invents her pupils to prevent her department being closed, uses the school's telephone network to surf the internet about Star Trek, and demands the return of a musical instrument from a former pupil now on death row.\\"The Interviews\\", Chalk, 27 February 1997, BBC 1, wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Juliet May Dan McGill (Martin Ball) is a young teacher who instantly develops a crush on Suzy when she arrives at the school, and attempts to date her throughout the series. The character is given most prominence in \\"The Staff Meeting\\" episode, which was written in order to save money by not having any guest actors. In this episode it is revealed that Dan has agreed to teach several subjects in order to keep his job.\\"The Staff Meeting\\", Chalk, 6 March 1997, BBC 1, wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Juliet May Suzy is dismayed to find that he invented an entire language when he became a foreign languages teacher, and then invented its country (Estranzia) when made a Geography teacher. After Ball's performance in that episode, Moffat promised him that he would not underwrite him in the second series. Mr Humboldt (Andrew Livingston), a teacher who is terrified that others might discover his sexuality. Slatt, who knows Humboldt's secret uses it to manipulate him, but Suzy (who assumes he is merely gay) encourages him to \\"come out\\". When he does so however, she is shocked to discover that he is actually a sadomasochist. Mr Carkdale (John Grillo), the head of English, very rarely utters anything but expletives. Struggling to find a rationale for his character, Grillo paced up and down a rehearsal room carrying a brown briefcase, which he remembers all of his own teachers carrying around, and shouting profanities. Mr Richard Nixon (John Wells) was the headteacher in the first series. Evans observes that he \\"shows precious little leadership\\", and the running of the school seems to fall to Slatt. Wells was too ill to participate in the second series, and died a year after its transmission. Mr J.F. Kennedy (Duncan Preston) replaced Mr Nixon as the head in the second series. Like Nixon, Mr Kennedy takes a back-seat in the developments. In the final episode he reads a letter from the former head, which inadvertently serves to show how their characters are identical. Jason Cockfoster (Damien Matthews) is a young religious education teacher. He arrives at the school in the first series episode \\"Both Called Eric\\", and appears more regularly in the second series. Suzy is immediately attracted to him, making Dan McGill so jealous that he tells the pupils that he is Satan. The character was a deliberate attempt to add some sex appeal to the show. Reception Due to the positive reaction of the studio audience during recordings, a second series was commissioned before the first had started to be transmitted. However, the show was, as Mark Lawson summarised, \\"widely disliked\\". The BBC's publicity department compared Chalk to Fawlty Towers in the publicity materials. Critics, though, took exception to a new show being compared to such a renowned and respected programme. The cast point out that Fawlty Towers and Chalk are completely different shows, while Nicola Walker says that the comparison is like being asked to be \\"compared to a comedy God\\". Writing for the BBC Guide to Comedy, Mark Lewisohn observes that the critical reception was mixed, with \\"its detractors pointing out that Eric Slatt was a carbon copy of John Cleese's Basil Fawlty [and] its supporters praising its non-PC, off- the-wall approach and the breathlessly paced plots that delivered moments of high farce.\\" Lewisohn also comments that while some elements of the show resemble Please Sir!, \\"Chalk more closely resembled the ill-fated Hardwicke House with its concentration on the teachers rather than the pupils, dark themes and overall depiction of the teachers as ... nuts.\\" Tom Lappin for Scotland on Sunday derided the combination of Chris Barrie's Gordon Brittas and Cleese's Basil Fawlty. The first four episodes were transmitted at 21:30, but the final two episodes of the second series were moved to 22:20. The second series received an unstable timeslot, being replaced in its more mainstream slot by Men Behaving Badly. Commenting on the second series, the Glasgow Herald said, \\"the manic depute head of Galfast High, Eric Slatt, is looking more and more like Basil Fawlty on a bad day. So are those of us who remain glued to it in ghoulish fascination to see if it can get any worse.\\" Tabloid newspaper The Mirror published a damming review of the show's second series opener: > The head of comedy at Television Centre deserves six of the best for > bringing back Chalk (BBC1) for a second term. If the opening episode of the > new series is anything to go by, we are in for six of the worst half-hours > of comedy in the history of television ... It is no surprise that the show > has been relegated to a late slot. It is a watershed for smut. Some of the > jokes were in the worst possible taste. The standards of comedy are so > pitiful, Galfast High School should not have been given a grant from TV > licence-payers' money and it is time it closed its gates for good. David > Bamber ... deserves a better vehicle for his acting talents. He was lured > into playing Eric Slatt because the character was supposed to be the > classroom equivalent of Basil Fawlty. They are as different as Chalk and > Cleese. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refused to even mention Chalk, joking that he might get attacked in the street.Coupling: Behind the Scenes, featurette (2002, prod./dir. Sarah Barnett & Christine Wilson) Coupling Season 1 DVD (Region 1), BBC Video, The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as \\"perverse\\" and \\"vapid\\", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as \\"mentally unstable\\", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play at the time he was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend.\\"The Staff Meeting\\" DVD audio commentary, Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD The unions' derision actually inspired The Times's Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying \\"genuine humour\\" such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, \\"the teaching organisations, you see, are half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, but far more importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, we rarely find funny.\\" Kevin Lygo, the show's executive producer and head of Independent Commissions Entertainment, who commissioned the series defending the show from the union's criticisms, saying: \\"Chalk is a comedy. Just as Ben Elton's Thin Blue Line does not reflect the modern police force nor The Vicar of Dibley the Church of England today, Chalk was never intended to reflect life in British schools.\\" Moffat said that Chalk was written \\"just for larks\\" and was not intended as a serious political diatribe. However, Scotland on Sunday responded in a piece placing Chalk in the context of other television shows about schools: \\"where such dramas fall down is not in shirking some contrived social responsibility but in their playing up to so many daft myths about the teaching profession.

While his writings contain many notions that were not well received by his contemporaries and were later disproven, Le Plongeon left a lasting legacy in his photographs documenting the ancient ruins. He was one of the earliest proponents of Mayanism.  Early life and careers  Le Plongeon was born on the island of Jersey on May 4, 1826.Desmond (2011) At 19, he sailed to South America and shipwrecked off the coast of Chile. While there he settled in Valparaiso and taught mathematics, drawing, and languages at a local college. In 1849 he sailed to San Francisco during the California gold rush to work as a surveyor, and also apprenticed to become a doctor of medicine. One of his accomplishments as a surveyor included drawing a plan for the layout of the town of Marysville, California in the Central Valley in 1851. Augustus was paid for his services as a surveyor with land deeds. He profited from the sale of these plots and this income would fund the majority of his archeological expeditions. Le Plongeon traveled to England and saw a demonstration for new photographic processes at The Great Exhibition. He then stayed in England to study photography under William Fox Talbot. Augustus wanted to test these methods in tropical climates so he spent time traveling to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands as well as Mexico, Australia, China, and the Pacific Islands. He returned to San Francisco to open a daguerreotype portrait studio on Clay Street. In 1862, he traveled to Lima, Peru and opened another photography studio and an \\"electro-hydropathic\\" medical clinic based on an early form of alternative medicine.  Travels in Peru  Le Plongeon pioneered the use of photography as a tool for his studies. He began using the wet collodion glass- plate negative process he used for studio portraits to record his explorations. He traveled extensively all over Peru for eight years visiting and photographing ancient ruins, including Tiahuanaco. Augustus also joined a number of E. G. Squier's expeditions and took photographs out in the field. Le Plongeon was influenced by the work of Charles √âtienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, John Lloyd Stephens, and Frederick Catherwood. These works, in combination with his own explorations in Peru, led Le Plongeon to believe that civilization had its origins in the New World. While in Peru Augustus became interested in the causes of earthquakes. He was able to observe the 1868 Arica earthquake and he studied the resulting damage and interviewed people about what they experienced. During this time Le Plongeon began to speak out against abuses by Jesuit priests and the Catholic Church in Peru. He published two anti-Jesuit books, La religion de Jesus comparada con las ensenanzas de la Iglesia (1867), and Los Jesuitas y el Peru (1869). In 1870, he left Peru and traveled back once again to San Francisco where he gave a number of illustrated lectures at the California Academy of Sciences on Peruvian archaeology and the causes of earthquakes. His travels then continued on to New York, and by 1871 he was at the British Museum in London studying Mesoamerican manuscripts.  Alice Dixon Le Plongeon  Alice Dixon, taken by her husband, Augustus While in London he met Alice Dixon, the woman with whom he would collaborate for the rest of his life. Alice was born in London in 1851. Her father, Henry Dixon, was recognized in the late nineteenth century for his contribution to the development of panchromatic photography, and for his photos of London architecture taken for the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London. Alice learned the techniques of photography from her father and worked as an assistant in his studio. After meeting Augustus, she became interested in ancient American civilizations and studied John L. Stephen's Incidents of Travel in Yucatan. She agreed to accompany Augustus on an archaeology expedition to study Maya ruins in Mexico. The pair left for New York to finalize preparations for the trip. They married in New York before traveling to Mexico in 1873.  Travels in Yucat√°n  In 1873, the Le Plongeons traveled to Yucat√°n to study ancient Maya sites. Their goal was to explore the possibility of links between the Maya and the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Atlantis. Their first stop was in M√©rida and they stayed there while Alice recovered from yellow fever. During her recuperation, the couple made connections with local scholars and both Augustus and Alice learned to speak Yucatec Maya. After Alice had recovered, the Le Plongeons made a short excursion to Uxmal. The Le Plongeons were in Yucat√°n during the Caste War, a conflict between the Maya, called the Chan Santa Cruz, and the army of Yucat√°n. When they traveled to Chicen Itza in 1875, they were accompanied by a military escort. When they arrived at the site, local Maya men were hired to clear the vegetation and help with excavations. The Le Plongeons were some of the first people to photograph and study Chicen Itza. Their photographic work was methodical and systematic, and they took hundreds of 3-D photos. They documented entire Maya buildings, such as the \\"Governor's Palace\\" at Uxmal, in overlapping photos by placing the camera on a tall tripod or scaffold to correct for perspective and then processed the plates in the unlit rooms of Maya buildings. In addition to entire facades of buildings, they also photographed small artifacts, and architectural details such as bas-reliefs, Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions, and sculptures. They excavated buildings, drew maps and copied murals, and made molds of bas-reliefs. Chacmool statue from the Chichen Itza site At Chichen Itza they excavated a structure known as the Platform of the Eagles and Jaguars and unearthed a large statue or altar figurine. They coined the name \\"Chaacmol\\" (later \\"Chac Mool\\" or chacmool) for it. Although their derivation of the name is known now to have had no association with figures of this type, the name has remained in general use among later archaeologists. This statue would later be used as a demonstration of Toltec influences at the site, with other examples found at the Toltec capital, Tula. They also documented their excavation of the Platform of Venus with photos as well as plan and cross- section drawings. From 1873 to 1884, the Le Plongeons visited and photographed other Maya sites such as Izamal, Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, Canc√∫n, and Ake, and traveled to Belize (British Honduras). During this time they made a few trips back to New York to attempt to sell bas-relief molds to museums, give lectures, and solicit financial backing for their studies.  Theories  By the 1880s, while most Mayanists accepted that the Maya civilization postdated Ancient Egypt, Le Plongeon stood by his theories. He cited his years of fieldwork and studies of archival sources, and challenged those he considered \\"armchair\\" archaeologists to debate the issues. However, as evidence mounted against cultural diffusion, Le Plongeon became marginalized and his theories fell further outside the growing mainstream of Maya archaeology. Le Plongeon insisted that the symbols of Freemasonry could be traced to the ancient Maya and that the ancient knowledge had come to ancient Egypt from the ancient Maya by way of Atlantis. He and Alice constructed an imaginative \\"history,\\" with the Maya sites in Yucat√°n being the cradle of civilization, with civilization then traveling east first to Atlantis and later to Ancient Egypt. The Le Plongeons named kings and queens of these dynasties and said that various artworks were portraits of such ancient royalty (such as the famous Chacmool, which the couple excavated at Chich√©n Itz√°). The Le Plongeons reconstructed a detailed but fanciful story of Queen Moo and Prince Coh (also known as \\"Chac Mool\\") in which Prince Coh's death resulted in the erection of monuments in his honor (similar to the commemoration of Prince Albert by Queen Victoria).  Later career and legacy  While most of Le Plongeon's contemporaries dismissed his theories, individuals such as Ignatius L. Donnelly and Helena Blavatsky drew upon Le Plongeon's research for their own theories. Augustus spent the remainder of his life in Brooklyn, New York, writing about the connections between Maya and Egypt and defending himself against detractors. Augustus le Plongeon died in Brooklyn in 1908 at the age of eighty-three; Alice followed in 1910 at the age of fifty-nine. A collection of the works of the Le Plongeons currently resides at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. The archive contains original records covering their travels from the 1860s through the early 1900s, including diaries, unpublished scholarly manuscripts and notes, correspondence, and extensive photographic documentation of ancient architecture and sculpture, city views, and ethnographic studies.

History Signy was first occupied in 1947 when a three-man meteorological station was established in Factory Cove above the old whaling station. It was the second research base on the South Orkney Islands (after the Argentine Orcadas Base in 1903). In 1955, a new hut, T√∏nsberg House was built on the site of the whaling station. In 1963, it was turned into a laboratory for biological research. Initially operated year-round, since 1995/6 the station has been open from November to April each year (southern hemisphere summer). Facilities Today, the base has four buildings with capacity for 8 people. The main building, S√∏rlle House (named after the whaling captain Petter S√∏rlle, who himself named Signy Island), provides living accommodation and laboratories. The other buildings are for storage and provision of power and water services. There are also four small huts around the island. Research Marine and terrestrial biology is carried out at Signy, particularly looking at the effects of climate change on the southern ocean ecosystems. Three species of penguin (Ad√©lie, chinstrap and gentoo) are monitored at the base. To continue an original time series of visual sea ice observations after the station became summer-only, an automated sea ice camera now operates all year around, providing a continuous record of sea ice extent near the station for over 50 years.

He was the son of Swiss naturalist √âmil Goeldi. Goeldi was born in born in Rio de Janeiro, but lived in Bel√©m, in the state Par√°, until he was 6 years old. His father was based there as director of the Museu de Hist√≥ria Natural e Etnografia do Par√° (presently the Em√≠lio Goeldi Museum). In 1910 his family returned to Switzerland and he started his studies in Bern, and later in Zurich. After serving for a brief period in the army during the First World War, Goeldi moved to Geneva, where he was accepted at the √âcole des Arts et M√©tiers. Frustrated with the academic environment, he abandoned the school after his father‚Äôs death in 1917 and began studying with artists Serge Pahnke (1875-1950) and Henri van Muyden (1860-s.d.), and later with Hermann K√ºmmerly, with whom he learned lithography. In 1919 Goeldi returned to Rio de Janeiro and began a career of engraver and illustrator for popular magazines. He became attached to a group of vanguardist artists and intellectuals, such as Beatrix Reynal, An√≠bal Machado (1894-1964), Otto Maria Carpeaux (1900-1978), Manuel Bandeira (1886-1968), √Ålvaro Moreyra (1888-1964), Ronald de Carvalho (1893-1935), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976) and Rachel de Queiroz (1910-2003). During this period, he worked intensely as an artist and did his first individual exposition, which was, however, poorly received by the art critics. Wounded by the criticisms, Goeldi withdrew from the artistic scene and isolated himself in the city of Niter√≥i. Solitary, he supported himself more and more as a well known illustrator for book editions and magazines, working mainly with xylogravures. He also became estranged from his family in 1922, refusing their appeal to return to Europe. He took part in the Week of Modern Art in S√£o Paulo that year. His first album, ‚Äú10 Gravuras em Madeira‚Äù was edited in 1930, allowing Goeldi to save enough money to return to Europe en 1931. He exposed in Bern and Berlin, and visited again his great inspirators, Alfred Kubin and Hermann K√ºmmerli. In the following decades, after returning to Brazil, Goeldi‚Äôs artistic prestige was strengthened, and he was accepted at the 25th Venice Bienal in 1950. He became nationally and internationally known and got his first prize, in the First International Art Bienal of S√£o Paulo, in 1951. From 1952 until his death, Goeldi became a respected and influential art teacher in the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He died on February 15, 1961, alone in his small apartment in Rio. Goeldi's work has been exposed post-humously in more than a hundred expositions in Brazil, Argentina, France, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.

Hampton. Plot The film opens with a brief scene serving as its introduction. A man is being caressed by feminine hands. The next shot includes the face of the woman, Tarantella (Tandra Quinn). A brief kiss between her and the man, ends with his lifeless body falling down. A disembodied voice asks the audience \\"Have you ever been kissed by a girl like this?\\" The narrative properly begins in a desert. A narrator (Lyle Talbot) mocks the overblown ego of humanity, a race of puny bipeds which claims to own planet Earth and every living thing on it. Yet, they are outnumbered by the insects, and the Hexapods are likely to survive longer than humans. The narrator then claims that when men or women venture off \\"the well beaten path of civilization\\" and deal with the unknown, the price of their survival is the loss of their sanity. During this narration, the film introduces its protagonists Grant Phillips (Robert Knapp) and Doreen Culbertson (Paula Hill). The narrator explains that the two of them are lost in the \\"great Mexican desert\\", the \\"Muerto desert\\". They are nearly dead from dehydration and sunburn when discovered by an American surveyor and his Mexican companion. These characters are identified as Frank (John Martin) and Pepe (Chrispin Martin). The two victims of the desert recover their senses in \\"Amer-Exico Field Hospital\\", somewhere in Mexico. Grant starts narrating his story to Doc Tucker (Allan Nixon), foreman Dan Mulcahey (Richard Travis), and Pepe. The film flash-backs to events occurring a year earlier in Zarpa Mesa. Famous scientist Leland Masterson (Harmon Stevens) arrives, having accepted an invitation from a fellow scientist named Dr. Aranya (Jackie Coogan). Aranya (name derived from the Spanish ara√±a for spider) has reportedly penned \\"brilliant\\" scientific treatises, and Masterson looks forward to meeting him in person. Masterson is genuinely intrigued by Aranya's theories, but his host informs Masterson that his work is not theoretical. He has already completed successful experiments, creating both human-sized tarantula spiders and human women with the abilities and instincts of spiders. His creation Tarantella has regenerative abilities, sufficient to regrow severed limbs. He seriously expects her to have a lifespan of several centuries. His experiments have had less success in male humans, who simply turn to disfigured dwarfs. Masterson is horrified and denounces Aranya and his creations, proclaiming that they should be destroyed. In response, Aranya has him injected with a drug, turning him into a doddering simpleton. The front page of a newspaper called Southwest Journal explains that Masterson was eventually found wandering in the desert. He was declared insane and placed in an asylum. Some time later, Masterson escapes the \\"Muerto State Asylum\\". He is next seen two days later, in an unnamed American town of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Also present there are Tarantella, businessman Jan van Croft (Nico Lek), and his fianc√©e Doreen. They were heading to Mexico for their wedding day, but their private airplane had engine problems and stranded them there. Jan's servant Wu (Samuel Wu) is seen exchanging glances with Tarantella. It serves as the first sign that he is working with her. Masterson is tracked to the bar by his nurse at the asylum, George (George Barrows, the \\"monster\\" in \\"Robot Monster\\"). The entire bar and its patrons observe Tarantella perform an energetic dance. Masterson apparently recognizes her, pulls a handgun, and shoots her. He then takes Jan, Doreen, and George hostage. He heads for Jan's private airplane and he forces pilot Grant to prepare for takeoff, despite the pilot's protests that only one engine is fully functional. The airplane departs with Doreen, George, Grant, Jan, Masterson, and Wu aboard it. Meanwhile, Tarantella regenerates following her apparent death, and leaves the bar. In mid-flight, Grant discovers that someone sabotaged the gyrocompass, resulting in them flying towards the wrong direction for most of the flight. Wu's facial expression allows the audience to learn who was the saboteur. The airplane crash-lands atop Zarpa Mesa, where the creations of Aranya were expecting them. For a while being, the creations simply observe them from afar. The film follows the activities of the stranded group for quite a while. There is sexual tension between Grant and Doreen, culminating in a passionate kiss. Meanwhile, the group dwindles with the deaths of first George, secondly Wu, and lastly Jan. Wu is confirmed to have served as an agent of Aranya, but one who outlived his usefulness. The last three members of the group are then captured. Grant soon recognizes that their captor's name is identical to the Spanish term for \\"spider\\", \\"ara√±a\\". Aranya cures Masterson from drug-induced imbecility, hoping to recruit him. This backfires as Masterson uses his intellect in a suicide attack. He allows Doreen and Grant to escape, then sets up an explosion which kills himself and everyone else. The flashback ends and we return to the hospital. He fails to convince anyone but Pepe of the truth in his story. Yet the finale reveals that at least one of Aranya's spider-women has survived.

He even claimed credit for supposedly directing the film The Blue Angel (1930). Actually Mesa was his only known film credit.Weaver (2009), p. 212-231 The music of the film was composed by Hoyt Curtin. It makes use of a flamenco guitar and a piano, with their sounds combined in what seems to be a free jazz composition. It was later reused in the film Jail Bait (1954).Craig (2009), p. 69-82 The narrator Lyle Talbot also appeared in various films by Ed Wood, such as Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). One of the various spider-women of Aranya is played by Dolores Fuller, who also appeared in Wood's films. The film also features the film debut of Katherine Victor, as the spider-woman who first drove Masterson to the desert. She would become better known as a regular in Jerry Warren films.Weaver (2000), p. 385-386 While Tarantella is one of the key characters of the film, this was a silent part for actress Tandra Quinn. She also had a silent part in The Neanderthal Man (1953), playing a deaf-mute. Decades later, Quinn recalled that she never received \\"a decent speaking part\\" in a film. She reportedly chose her stage name by modifying one suggested by Tevos. He had suggested the stage name Tandra Nova. She agreed to the first name \\"Tandra\\", but found the last name unsuitable and reminiscent of Lou Nova. She instead chose the last name \\"Quinn\\" in honor of dancer Joan Quinn. Mesa was one of six 1950s films to make use of wire-controlled giant spiders. The others were Cat-Women of the Moon (1953), Tarantula (1955), World Without End (1956), Queen of Outer Space (1958), and Missile to the Moon (1958).Johnson (1996), p. 23 Mesa and Cat-Women made use of similar giant spider props. However the spider used in Mesa was limited in movement, a single jump being its greatest action feat. The one in Cat-Women was created by Wah Chang and was more advanced. Both Mesa and Missile to the Moon were partially filmed in the Red Rock Canyon State Park.Johnson (1996), p. 357 Release  The film was distributed in the United States by Howco Productions Inc. and reissued in 1956 through Ron Ormond Enterprises. Reception The movie is criticized for the low quality acting, most notably that of Coogan, and Harmon Stevens, who plays Dr. Masterson. The plot is far from straightforward.

Later blacklisted from the industry for her labor union work, she became a member of the Communist Party USA and a consumer activist. In her last years as a nursing home resident she helped to organize the staff. Early years Lemlich was born March 28, 1886, in the Ukrainian city of Gorodok, to a Jewish family. Raised in a predominantly Yiddish-speaking village, young Lemlich learned to read Russian over her parents' objections, sewing buttonholes and writing letters for illiterate neighbors to raise money for her books. After a neighbor introduced her to revolutionary literature, Lemlich became a committed socialist. She immigrated to the United States with her family in 1903, following a pogrom in Kishinev. Lemlich was able to find a job in the garment industry upon her arrival in New York. Conditions there had become even worse since the turn of the century, as the new industrial sewing machine allowed employers to demand twice as much production from their employees, who often had to supply their own machines and carry them to and from work. Lemlich, along with many of her co-workers, rebelled against the long hours, low pay, lack of opportunities for advancement, and humiliating treatment from supervisors. Lemlich became involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and was elected to the executive board of Local 25 of the ILGWU. Lemlich quickly made a name for herself among her fellow workers, leading several strikes of shirtwaist makers and challenging the mostly male leadership of the union to organize women garment workers. She combined boldness with a good deal of charm (she was known for her fine singing voice) and personal bravery (she returned to the picket line in 1909 after having several ribs broken when gangsters hired by the employers attacked the picketers). Lemlich came to the attention of the outside world at the mass meeting held at Cooper Union on November 22, 1909 to rally support for the striking shirtwaist workers at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company and Leiserson Company. For two hours the leading figures of the American labor movement and socialist leaders of the Lower East Side spoke in general terms about the need for solidarity and preparedness. Desiring a call to action, not just words, Lemlich demanded the opportunity to speak. Lifted onto the platform, she said: The crowd responded enthusiastically and, after taking a modified version of the ancient Jewish oath of fidelity to Israel  \\"If I turn traitor to the cause I now pledge, may this hand wither from the arm I now raise\\"  voted for a general strike. Approximately 20,000 out of the 32,000 workers in the shirtwaist trade walked out in the next two days; this would become known as the Uprising of the 20,000. Lemlich took a leading role in bringing workers out, speaking at rallies until she lost her voice. The strike lasted until February 10, 1910, producing union contracts at almost every shop, but not at Triangle Shirtwaist. Triangle Shirtwaist became a synonym for \\"sweatshop\\" during the following year. On March 25, 1911, nearly 150 garment workers died as a result of a fire that consumed the factory. Workers were either burned to death or died jumping to escape the flames. Lemlich searched through the armory where the dead had been taken to search for a missing cousin; a newspaper reporter described her as convulsed by hysterical laughter and tears when she did not find her. Suffrage Blacklisted from the industry and at odds with the conservative leadership of the ILGWU, Lemlich devoted herself to the campaign for women's suffrage. Like her colleagues Rose Schneiderman and Pauline Newman, Lemlich portrayed women's suffrage as necessary for the improvement of working women's lives, both inside and outside the workplace. > The manufacturer has a vote; the bosses have votes; the foremen have votes, > the inspectors have votes. The working girl has no vote. When she asks to > have a building in which she must work made clean and safe, the officials do > not have to listen. When she asks not to work such long hours, they do not > have to listen. . . . [U]ntil the men in the Legislature at Albany represent > her as well as the bosses and the foremen, she will not get justice; she > will not get fair conditions. That is why the working woman now says that > she must have the vote. Lemlich, like Newman and Schneiderman, also had strong personal and political differences with the upper and middle class women who led the suffrage movement. Mary Beard fired Lemlich, for reasons that are not entirely clear, less than a year after hiring her to campaign for suffrage in 1911. Lemlich continued her suffrage activities, founding the Wage Earner‚Äôs Suffrage League, a working class alternative to middle class suffrage organizations, along with Schneiderman, Leonora O'Reilly, and two other women garment workers. Yet while the League admitted only working class women to membership, it was dependent on non-working class women for support and, in deference to its supporters' wishes, affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association  the organization to which it saw itself as an alternative  rather than with the Socialist Party Women's Committee. The Wage Earner‚Äôs Suffrage League passed out of existence, however, after organizing a successful rally at Cooper Union at which Lemlich, Schneiderman, and others spoke. Lemlich continued her suffrage activities for the Women's Trade Union League, while Schneiderman, who quit the WTUL at that time, went to work for the ILGWU before returning to the WTUL several years later. Other activists, such as Pauline Newman, worked under the aegis of the Socialist Party, which supported suffrage even though many in the leadership considered it a distraction from the more urgent business of class struggle. Consumer advocacy Lemlich married Joe Shavelson in 1913. The couple had three children: Irving Charles Velson, Martha Shavelson Schaffer, and Rita Shavelson Margules. Moving to the solidly working-class neighborhood of East New York, then later to Brighton Beach, she did not return to work, other than on an occasional part-time basis, for the next thirty years. Instead she devoted herself to raising a family and organizing housewives. Others had organized in this area before Lemlich: Jewish housewives in New York had boycotted kosher butchers to protest high prices in the first decade of the twentieth century and the Brooklyn Tenants Union led rent strikes and fought evictions. After joining the Communist Party, which largely disdained the notion of consumer organizing, Lemlich and Kate Gitlow, mother of Benjamin Gitlow, attempted to organize a union of housewives that would address not only consumers' issues, but housing and education as well. The United Council of Working Class Housewives also raised money and organized relief for strikers in Passaic, New Jersey during the bitter 1926 strike. In 1929, after the Communist Party created a Women's Commission, Lemlich launched the United Council of Working Class Women, which eventually had nearly fifty branches in New York City, as well as affiliates in Philadelphia, Seattle, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. The organization recruited among CP members, but did not identify the Council with the CP or press non-Party members of the Council to join the party as well. The UCWCW led a widespread boycott of butcher shops to protest high meat prices in 1935, using the militant tactics of flying squadrons of picketers that shut down more than 4,000 butcher shops in New York City. The strike became nationwide and the UCWCW won support outside the Jewish and African-American communities to which it had been limited in New York. The UCWCW renamed itself the Progressive Women's Councils the following years as part of the Popular Front politics of the day. The Party withdrew support for the councils and discontinued publications aimed at women, however, in 1938. Lemlich continued to be active in the PWC, however, and was a local leader in it after it affiliated with the International Worker's Order in the 1940s. The Councils organized even broader boycotts to protest high prices in 1948 and 1951, before accusations of Communist Party dominance destroyed it in the early 1950s. The IWO was ordered dissolved by the state of New York in 1952. Lemlich continued her activities as part of the Emma Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs, which raised funds for Red Mogen David, protesting nuclear weapons, campaigned for ratification of the United Nations' Convention on Genocide, and against the War in Vietnam, and forging alliances with Sojourners for Truth, an African-American women's civil rights organization. Lemlich was also active in Unemployed Councils activities and in founding the Emma Lazarus Council, which supported tenant rights. The Emma Lazarus Council declared in 1931 that no one would be evicted in Brighton Beach for inability to pay rent, then backed that up by rallying supporters to prevent evictions and returning tenants' furniture to their apartments in those cases in which authorities attempted to effect eviction. Lemlich remained an unwavering member of the Communist Party, denouncing the trial and execution of the Rosenbergs. Her passport was revoked after a trip to the Soviet Union in 1951. She retired from garment work in 1954, then fought a long battle with the ILGWU to obtain a pension. After the death of her second husband she moved to California to be near her children and in-laws in the 1960s, she entered the Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. As a resident she persuaded the management to join in the United Farm Workers boycotts of grapes and lettuce, then prodded the workers there to organize. References Further reading Orleck, Annalise.

This rendering has etymological justification, as appears from the poetical use of the plural in such expressions as to ride, or stalk, or stand on the \\"high places\\" of the earth, the sea, the clouds, and from the corresponding usage in Assyrian; but it has been surmised that a semantic shift occurred because the places of worship were originally upon hilltops, or because the bamah was an artificial platform or mound, perhaps imitating the natural eminence which was the oldest holy place, but neither view is historically demonstrable. The development of the religious significance of the word took place probably not in Israel but among the Canaanites, from whom the Israelites, in taking possession of the holy places of the land, also adopted the name. Many towns and villages in ancient Israel had their own places of sacrifice, commonly called bamot. It has been suggested that the plural of the word referred to places of sacred prostitution and of pagan worship. Hebrew Bible Megiddo. From the Hebrew Bible and from existing remains a good idea may be formed of the appearance of such a place of worship. It was often on the hill above the town, as at Ramah (); there was a stele (matzevah), the seat of the deity, and a wooden post or pole (asherah, named after the goddess Asherah), which marked the place as sacred and was itself an object of worship; there was a stone altar, often of considerable size and hewn out of the solid rock or built of unhewn stones (; see altar), on which offerings were burnt (mizbeh, lit. \\"slaughter place\\"); a cistern for water, and perhaps low stone tables for dressing the victims; sometimes also a hall (lishkah) for the sacrificial feasts. Around these places the religion of the ancient Israelite centred; at festival seasons, or to make or fulfil a vow, he might journey to more famous sanctuaries at a distance from his home, but ordinarily offerings were made at the bamah of his own town. The building of YHWH's singular Temple at Jerusalem, which (under the Law of Moses) had an exclusive right to offer sacrifices (), did not stop the bamot sacrifices until Kings Hezekiah and Josiah proscribed them. The prophets of the 8th century BC assail the popular religion as corrupt and licentious, and as fostering the monstrous delusion that immoral men can buy the favour of God by worship; but they make no difference in this respect between the high places of Israel and the temple in Jerusalem (cf. sqq.; ; Isaiah to sqq.). Hosea stigmatizes the whole cultus as pure heathenism‚ÄîCanaanite Baal-worship adopted by apostate Israel. The fundamental law in prohibits sacrifice at every place except the temple in Jerusalem; in accordance with this law Josiah, in 621 BC, destroyed and desecrated the altars (bmoth) throughout his kingdom (where Yahweh had been worshipped since times before a permanent singular Temple at Jerusalem was erected) and forcibly removed their priests to Jerusalem, where they occupied an inferior rank in the temple ministry. In the prophets of the 7th and 6th centuries BC, the word bamot connotes \\"seat of heathenish or idolatrous worship\\"; and the historians of the period apply the term in this opprobrious sense not only to places sacred to other gods but to the old holy places of Yahweh in the cities and villages of Judah, which, in their view, had been illegitimate since the building of Solomon's temple, and therefore not really seats of the worship of Yahweh; even the most pious kings of Judah are censured in the Books of Kings for tolerating their existence. The reaction that followed the death of Josiah (608 BC) restored the old altars of Yahweh; they survived the destruction of the temple in 586 BC, and it is probable that after its restoration (520‚Äì516 BC) they only slowly disappeared, in consequence partly of the natural predominance of Jerusalem in the little territory of Judaea, partly of the gradual establishment of the supremacy of the written law over custom and tradition in the Persian period. The rule of the Law of Moses that sacrifice can be offered to Yahweh only at the Temple in Jerusalem was never fully established in fact. The Jewish military colonists in Elephantine in the 5th century BC had their altar of Yahweh beside the highway; the Jews in Egypt in the Ptolemaic period had, besides many local sanctuaries, one greater temple at Leontopolis, with a priesthood whose claim to \\"valid orders\\" was much better than that of the High Priests in Jerusalem, and the legitimacy of whose worship is admitted even by the Palestinian rabbis. Modern Judaism In Jewish synagogues, the \\"High Place\\" (bimah) is the elevated platform from which the Torah is read. It traditionally had its origin from the platform erected in the Temple in Jerusalem at which the king would read the Torah during the Hakhel ceremony every seven years at the Feast of Tabernacles (). The bimah is located in the center of Orthodox synagogues, and in the front of Reform synagogues. Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism The Holy Place (Sanctuary) in the church of the Saint Vladimir Skete Valaam monastery. To the left is the Holy Table (altar) with the Gospel Book on the High Place. To the right is the Cathedra (Bishop's Throne). In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches the High Place is the name used for the location of the cathedra (episcopal throne), set in the center of the apse of a church's sanctuary, behind the Holy Table (altar). In larger churches there may be a literal elevation, but there is often not room for this in smaller churches. The cathedra is surrounded on both sides by the synthronos, a set of other seats or benches for the use of the priests. Every Orthodox church and Eastern Catholic church has such a High Place even if it is not a cathedral. The term High Place also refers to the central portion of the Holy Table, where the antimension and Gospel Book are normally kept. The only other objects that are permitted to occupy this place on the altar are the chalice and discos (paten) for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. On the various Feasts of the Cross, a tray covered by an a√´r (liturgical veil) holding a Cross and branches of basil is placed on the High Place of the Holy Table until it is taken in procession to the center of the nave. On Good Friday, the Epitaphion is set on the Holy Table until it is taken to the \\"tomb\\" in the center of the nave for veneration by the faithful. During the Paschal Vigil, this Epitaphion is taken through the Holy Doors and placed again on the High Place of the Holy Table, where it will remain until the Ascension.

Sumner (DD-692), was the lead ship of her class of destroyers. The ship was named for Allen Melancthon Sumner, a United States Marine Corps captain, who was killed in action during World War I. Allen M. Sumner was laid down on 7 July 1943 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company; launched on 15 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Allen M. Sumner, Captain Sumner's widow; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 26 January 1944. Service history =World War II= 1944 The destroyer was fitted out at the New York Navy Yard until 3 March when she got underway for shakedown training in the waters around Bermuda. Allen M. Sumner returned to New York on 8 April and commenced post- shakedown availability. Repairs were completed on 3 May, and the warship stood out of New York bound for Norfolk, Virginia. She arrived there the following day and began two months of duty as a training platform for destroyer nucleus crews. The warship headed north on 5 July and arrived back at New York the next day. Following a five-week availability at the navy yard there, Allen M. Sumner put to sea on 12 August, bound ultimately for the Pacific. Along the way, she conducted antisubmarine warfare and antiair warfare exercises, stopped briefly at Norfolk, and transited the Panama Canal on 29 August. The destroyer stayed overnight at San Diego on 7 and 8 September before continuing on to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 14 September and began five weeks of exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. Allen M. Sumner in the Atlantic, 26 March 1944 Her stay in Hawaii lasted until 23 October when she steamed out of Pearl Harbor in company with the battleship , bound for duty in the western Pacific with the Fast Carrier Task Force. Steaming via Eniwetok, the destroyer entered Ulithi lagoon on 5 November. Allen M. Sumner remained at Ulithi until 19 November at which time she departed the atoll to join Task Group (TG) 38.4 at sea. After rendezvousing with the carriers, she accompanied them to waters near Yap Island whence the aircraft carriers launched air strikes on 22 November before reentering Ulithi that same day. The destroyer remained there for 5 days and then returned to sea, bound for newly invaded Leyte in the Philippines. She arrived in San Pedro Bay on 29 November and began patrolling Leyte Gulf. That duty‚Äîpunctuated intermittently by air alerts‚Äîlasted until the evening of 2 December when Allen M. Sumner set course for Ormoc Bay in company with the destroyers and . Reports from American aircraft earlier that day had indicated that an enemy reinforcement convoy was entering the bay that night, and the three warships were sent to destroy it. Just after 2300 that night, the destroyers suffered the first of many air attacks when a Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" ‚Äî a fast, twin-engine, reconnaissance plane ‚Äî dropped a bomb which near-missed Allen M. Sumner about from the ship's starboard bow, pierced her hull with fragments, and started a fire on board. Bomb fragments also wounded one officer and 12 men. Air attacks continued; but, just after midnight, the three destroyers made surface radar contact on a pair of Japanese destroyers later identified as and . Less than 10 minutes into the battle, Kuwa succumbed to the combined fire of the two destroyers, and the wrecked and burning mass began to sink. Take, however, evened the score just as Allen M. Sumner and Cooper joined Moale in firing on the remaining Japanese warship. One of her torpedoes slammed into Cooper amidships, broke that American destroyer's back, and sank her almost immediately. Less than half of Coopers crew managed to get off the ship. Most of those were later rescued‚Äîbut by PBY Catalinas rather than by Coopers division mates who were still being subjected to heavy shore battery fire and air raids. Any attempt at rescue by Allen M. Sumner and Moale would have made them virtually stationary targets. At about 0145 on the 3rd, the two remaining American warships began retirement from Ormoc Bay and set a course for San Pedro Bay where they arrived later that day. Allen M. Sumner spent the next nine days in San Pedro Bay undergoing upkeep and repairing the minor damage that she had suffered in the action at Ormoc Bay. Though the area was subjected to intermittent air raids throughout that period, Allen M. Sumner recorded only one, long-range‚Äîin excess of ‚Äîapproach by an enemy aircraft on 6 December. On 12 December, she departed San Pedro Bay and joined the screen of TG 78.3, bound for the landings on Mindoro Island. That task group constituted Rear Admiral Arthur D. Struble's Mindoro Attack Group. Although the group came under air attack during the transit, Allen M. Sumner escaped damage. On 15 December, she moved in with the close covering group to participate in the preinvasion shore bombardment, and the subsequent landings went forward against negligible opposition. Some enemy aircraft attempted to attack the invasion force, and Allen M. Sumner joined Moale and in splashing an enemy light bomber. On the following day, the destroyer departed Mindoro to return to Leyte where she arrived on 18 December. Between 26 and 29 December, the warship escorted a resupply echelon to Mindoro and back to San Pedro Bay. 1945 On 2 January 1945, the destroyer stood out of San Pedro Bay, bound for the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf in the screen for the cruisers and battleships of Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Bombardment and Fire Support Group (TG 77.2). Early on 6 January, Allen M. Sumner moved into Lingayen Gulf to support minesweeping operations. Around noon, her unit came under air attack by kamikazes. The first plane retreated in the face of a heavy antiaircraft barrage while the second attacker hovered just out of range as a decoy to mask a run in by a third suicider. The latter plane dove on Allen M. Sumner strafing as he came. He swooped in out of the sun on the destroyer's port bow and crashed into her near the after stack and after torpedo mount. The warship lost 14 men killed and 19 injured. Extensive damage required her to retire from the gulf and join the heavy units of TG 77.2. Nevertheless, Allen M. Sumner remained in action with that unit and supported the Lingayen operation until 14 January. On that day, she began a long and somewhat circuitous voyage back to the United States for repairs. She arrived at Manus in the Admiralties on 18 January and remained there for nine days. She got underway again on 27 January in company with the escort carrier and, after stopping at Majuro en route, arrived in Pearl Harbor on 6 February. She departed Oahu the next day and arrived at Hunters Point, California, on 13 February to begin repairs. Her renewal work was completed on 10 April and, four days later, she began duty training prospective destroyer crews along the west coast. Just over three months later, on 17 July, she was relieved of training duty and departed San Francisco to return to the western Pacific. The destroyer arrived at Oahu on the 23rd and began three weeks of training operations out of Pearl Harbor. On 12 August, Allen M. Summer stood out of Hawaii to return to the war zone. However, when she was two days out, the Japanese capitulated. Nevertheless, the warship continued her voyage west. Following a two-day stop at Eniwetok, she got underway again on 21 August and, six-days later, rendezvoused with TG 38.3 in Japanese waters. After some three weeks of postwar patrols, first with TG 38.3 and later with TG 38.1, the destroyer put into Tokyo Bay on 16 September. She remained there only six days before getting underway for the Marianas on 22 August. The ship reached Saipan three days later but soon resumed her voyage back to the United States arriving on the west coast in October and assuming duty as a training platform for prospective destroyer crews. =1946 to 1952= These operations continued until May 1946 when the destroyer departed the west coast, bound for the Central Pacific to support Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. At the conclusion of that assignment late that summer, she returned to her former west coast duty. On 23 February 1947, Allen M. Sumner began an extended cruise to the Far East which included visits to Australia, the Marianas, the Philippines, China, and Japan before her return to the west coast for an overhaul and subsequent local operations. That duty continued until early in 1949 at which time the ship was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal in mid-April and arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 20 April. Between the spring of 1949 and the spring of 1953, the destroyer conducted normal peacetime operations out of Norfolk. That routine was broken only by a tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea with the 6th Fleet between November 1950 and March 1951. Otherwise, she cruised along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies conducting training‚Äîparticularly in antisubmarine warfare. =1953 to 1966= On 24 April 1953, the destroyer stood out of Norfolk, bound for her only assignment in the war zone during the Korean War. Steaming by way of the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and Indian Ocean, Allen M. Sumner arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, early in June. After 10 days in port, she joined Task Force (TF) 77 in the Sea of Japan and began two months of duty as a plane guard and antisubmarine screening ship for the fast carriers while they sent their aircraft against targets in North Korea. While she was assigned those tasks, the armistice of 27 July ended the Korean War. Following a tour of duty with TF 95 patrolling the southern coast of Korea and a brief stop at Yokosuka, the warship headed back to the United States via the Pacific, the west coast, and the Panama Canal. She arrived back in Norfolk on 27 October. Over the next eight years, Allen M. Sumner alternated east coast and West Indies operations with seven deployments to European waters. During the first two‚Äîconducted in the fall of 1954 and the summer of 1955, respectively‚Äîshe visited northern European waters to participate in exercises with units of other NATO navies. The third European deployment‚Äîto the Mediterranean‚Äîcame in July 1956. During that four-month assignment, the Suez crisis erupted, and Allen M. Sumner supported the evacuation of American citizens from Egypt at Alexandria. On the fourth deployment of the period, she returned to northern European waters in September and October 1957. In February 1958, she embarked upon another deployment to the Mediterranean that lasted until July. After a period of normal east coast operations, the destroyer once again headed toward the \\"middle sea\\" in February 1958. That tour of duty differed from those preceding in that Allen M. Sumner was assigned to independent duty in the Persian Gulf and in the western portion of the Indian Ocean. She returned to the United States on 30 August and began a year of normal operations in the western Atlantic. In September 1960, the warship voyaged to the Mediterranean once more and again served on independent duty in the Persian Gulf and in the western Indian Ocean. She returned to the United States on 19 April 1961 and, on 17 May, began a fleet rehabilitation and modernization overhaul during which her antisubmarine warfare capabilities were improved and updated. Allen M. Sumner completed her overhaul on 2 January 1962 and resumed her schedule of east coast operations alternated with Mediterranean cruises. Between March and September 1962, she served with the 6th Fleet. Soon after her return to American waters, President John F. Kennedy declared a \\"quarantine\\" of Cuba in response to the siting of offensive Soviet missiles on that island. Allen M. Sumner was one of the first warships to take up station off Cuba in October 1962. At the successful conclusion of that operation, she resumed normal duty out of Mayport, Florida. That employment‚Äîincluding frequent duty as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School‚Äîcontinued through 1963 and into 1964. In June and July 1964, the destroyer made a brief deployment to the Mediterranean for a midshipman cruise. Upon her return to the western hemisphere, she resumed normal duty out of Mayport. In the spring of 1965, political unrest in the Dominican Republic took her to the waters around that troubled island. Upon concluding that assignment, the destroyer returned to Mayport and resumed operations out of that port. In October, she embarked upon another deployment in the Mediterranean. After a routine tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the \\"middle sea,\\" Allen M. Sumner returned to Mayport on 8 March 1966 and began 11 months of operations out of her home port which included duty as a support ship for the Gemini 10 space shot in July. =Vietnam= A QH-50 DASH drone hovering over Allen M. Sumner¬¥s flight deck, 1969. On 7 February 1967, the destroyer departed Mayport on her way to her first and only deployment to the Vietnam war zone. Steaming via the Panama Canal and Hawaii, she arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 14 March. Four days later, she got underway for the coast of Vietnam. On her first tour in the Gulf of Tonkin, Allen M. Sumner served as \\"shotgun\\" (screening ship) for while the nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser served on positive identification radar advisory zone duty in the gulf. She was relieved of that assignment on 5 April to participate in Operation Seadragon, the interdiction of communist waterborne logistics operations. That assignment lasted until 11 April, when she joined the screen of the aircraft carrier for a voyage to Sasebo, Japan. She remained at Sasebo from 15 to 22 April before heading back to the Gulf of Tonkin again in company with Hancock. Upon her return to Vietnamese waters, Allen M. Sumner moved inshore with the Australian cruiser to resume \\"Sea-dragon\\" duty and, later, to provide shore bombardment support for marines engaged in Operation Beau Charger, a combined waterborne and airborne amphibious assault conducted near the demilitarized zone late in May. At the end of May, she rejoined the fast carriers on Yankee Station and screened them until 10 June when she resumed \\"Seadragon\\" duty. Her work closer to the Vietnam coast lasted for 12 days. On 22 June, she departed Vietnamese waters and set a course for Kaohsiung, Taiwan, where she visited from 26 June to 2 July. Departing Kaohsiung on the latter day, Allen M. Sumner called at Hong Kong from 7 to 9 July. On 11 July, she returned to the coast of Vietnam and began a nine-day gunfire support mission. Leaving Vietnamese waters on 20 July, the destroyer made a six-day stop at Subic Bay in the Philippines from 22 to 28 July before returning to the gunline from 30 July to 1 August. She then began her voyage back to the United States; stopped at Yokosuka, Hawaii, and Acapulco, in Mexico; transited the Panama Canal on 7 September, and reached Mayport on 10 September. =Post- Vietnam= Allen M. Sumner in 1970. The destroyer resumed normal operations out of Mayport in October. Throughout 1968, she cruised the waters of the West Indies, frequently providing support for the encircled naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Similar duty carried her through the first four months of 1969. In May, she voyaged to England and northern European waters to participate in a NATO review celebrating the 20th anniversary of the alliance.

In 2017, Johnny Swinger started to co-host \\"The Raven Effect\\" podcast on Podcast One with fellow pro wrestler Raven; however after a couple of weeks, he was replaced by comedian and former WCW employee Buttsby Berkeley, and backyard wrestler Joseph Feeney due to poor ratings. =Return to Impact Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent)= In 2019 Swinger re-signed with TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling. He debuted on the September 27, 2019 episode of Impact Wrestling. After a brief feud with Petey Williams establishing himself as a villainous character with the gimmick of an out-of-touch 80's independent wrestler, Swinger would proceed to get beaten by Ken Shamrock. After this match with Shamrock, Swinger would briefly reunite with former tag team partner Glenn Gilbertti. From there, Swinger would force himself into a temporary tag team informally known as the Mack and Pack Connection with Willie Mack on the February 19, 2020 episode of Impact. After Mack won the X Division Championship, Chris Bey would inform Swinger of Mack's disdain for Swinger, leading to a match between the two, which was won by Mack. After losing the contest Swinger engaged in post-match beatdown. Swinger started to manage and team with Bey.

It advocated free health care and education provision, a managed public transport infrastructure free to all at the point of use and a moratorium on the use of green belt land for building. It also supported a zero tolerance policy toward crime, and was against the introduction of identity cards and recent anti-terrorist legislation on civil liberties grounds. In 2004 the party made a breakthrough in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, winning 18 seats, a gain of 13. The party later suffered a split, defections, and a loss of councillors in elections, reducing their number of councillors in Wigan Borough to five. They slowly expanded outside the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan into the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, the City of Salford, where they gained a seat in 2008, and Warrington Borough. Founding The party was founded in March 2002 by Peter Franzen, a construction industry professional originally from Liverpool and now living in Golborne. The candidates stood on a platform of zero tolerance of crime and improved facilities for young people. Community Action councillors have a free vote on any issue as the party does not impose a whip, and includes former supporters of all three main parties. Electoral history The party put up candidates in four constituencies in the 2005 general election. It won no representation in the House of Commons, but had a number of councillors in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester. In 2004 it made a large break through in Wigan Borough winning 18 seats, a gain of 13. They formed the official opposition group, the 'Democratic Alliance', with their ten councillors joining the Liberal Democrats' three in May 2007, but the grouping disbanded in July 2009. They supported the Green Party in the North-West region in the 2009 European elections. =2002 local election= In their first election, the CAP stood five candidates in Wigan Borough elections and returned two councillors, both in Makerfield constituency, Franzen unseating the deputy leader of the council. =2003 local election= The party stood 11 candidates in Wigan Borough, and took three seats from Labour, becoming the largest opposition party with five councillors. =2004 local election= The party stood 48 candidates in Wigan Borough, winning a total of 18 seats in Makerfield Constituency and becoming the official opposition on the council. After the election the Labour leader of the council Peter Smith argued that \\"They are essentially a negative party, good at coming up with issues to campaign on, but not very good at finding solutions.\\" =2005 general election= Franzen stood in Makerfield against Ian McCartney, deputy chairman of the Labour Party, and the party stood three other candidates. Franzen received 2,769 votes (7.8%). Ian Franzen stood in Leigh, receiving 2,189 votes (6.0%). Former Labour council leader Mike Hughes received 573 votes in Warrington North (1.4%). =2006 local election= The CAP lost three seats in Makerfield to Labour. =2007 local election= The party held two seats and gained one from Community Performance First, but lost two seats to Labour. They stood four candidates in St. Helens, and two in Salford. =2008 local election= The party held two seats in Makerfield, but lost Peter Franzen's seat in Golbourne and Lowton West to Labour by 76 votes, and another seat to the Conservatives, resulting in their Democratic Alliance group losing its status as the official opposition group. The Labour Party made a complaint to the police about a YouTube video posted by one of the CAP councillors, Ed Houlton, about a former Labour mayor the day before the May elections, but no charges were brought. In Salford's Irlam ward, their candidate Rick Houlton unseated Roger Jones, the Labour chairman of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority. The CAP opposed the congestion charge for Manchester that was proposed by Jones. Peel Holdings, a Manchester property company, commissioned a market research company to call people in Irlam ward about the congestion charge plan in November 2007. In January 2008, Peel met with the Liberal Democrats and Community Action Party to discuss how they could help them defeat councillors who were backing the congestion charge. A police investigation was launched over a possible breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, but the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence. Houlton was criticised for his low council meeting attendance, which he said was due to working nights. Split and defections The Community Performance First Party was registered with the Electoral Commission in 2006 by three CAP councillors ahead of the local elections, who said that they would still stand as CAP candidates. They were expelled from the party in April 2006, less than a month before the local elections, and the CAP took legal action to prevent them using the CAP logo. An Ashton in Makerfield councillor defected to the independent group in May 2007, followed by a Winstanley councillor in May 2008. A Leigh councillor defected to the Conservative Party in January 2009, which made the Conservatives the official opposition group on Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council. A further defection to the independent group occurred in May 2009. On 7 February 2014 it was announced that Mike Moulding had reregistered the political party. This was after the founder and leader of the party, Peter Franzen, had lapsed the party the previous year. Since then the founder and the new leader have been in a battle over the rights of the name.http://www.wigantoday.net/news/local/party-is-relaunched-as-leader-vows- to-return-1-6424961 The party was deregistered again in 2016.http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2232 References Political parties established in 2002 Political parties disestablished in 2016 Politics of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan Defunct political parties in England 2002 establishments in England 2016 disestablishments in England ","title":"Community Action Party"},{"id":"1853589","text":"Liability insurance (also called third-party insurance) is a part of the general insurance system of risk financing to protect the purchaser (the \\"insured\\") from the risks of liabilities imposed by lawsuits and similar claims and protects the insured if the purchaser is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy. Originally, individual companies that faced a common peril formed a group and created a self-help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss (in other words, a mutual insurance arrangement). The modern system relies on dedicated carriers, usually for-profit, to offer protection against specified perils in consideration of a premium. Liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third-party insurance claims, i.e., payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. In general, damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. When a claim is made, the insurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured. The legal costs of a defence normally do not affect policy limits unless the policy expressly states otherwise; this default rule is useful because defence costs tend to soar when cases go to trial. In many cases, the defense portion of the policy is actually more valuable than the insurance, as in complicated cases, the cost of defending the case might be more than the amount being claimed, especially in so-called \\"nuisance\\" cases where the insured must be defended even though no liability is ever brought to trial.  Market  Commercial liability is an important segment for the insurance industry. With premium income of USD 160 billion in 2013, it accounted for 10% of global non-life premiums of USD 1 550 billion, or 23% of the global commercial lines premiums. Liability insurance is far more prevalent in the advanced than emerging markets. The advanced markets accounted for 93% of global liability premiums in 2013, while their share of global non-life premiums was 79%.Liability claims trends: emerging risks and rebounding economic drivers, Swiss Re sigma, Sept 2014 \\"http://media.swissre.com/documents/sigma4_2014_en.pdf\\" The US is by far the largest market, with 51% of the global liability premiums written in 2013. This is due to the size of the US economy and high penetration of liability insurance (0.5% of GDP). In 2013, US businesses spent USD 84 billion on commercial liability covers, of which USD 50 billion was on general liability, including USD 12 billion for Errors and Omissions (E&O;) and USD 5.4 billion for Directors and Officers (D&O;). US businesses spent another USD 13 billion on the liability portion of commercial multi-peril policies, USD 9.5 billion for medical malpractice and USD 3 billion for product liability covers. The UK is the world‚Äôs second largest market for liability insurance, with USD 9.9 billion of liability premiums in 2013. The largest sub-line of business is public and product liability. This is followed by professional indemnity and employers‚Äô liability (cover for employment-related accidents and illnesses). There has been a significant shift in the sub-segments of UK liability insurance. In the last decade, the share of professional indemnity has increased from about 14% to 32%, highlighting the shift towards a more services-driven economy. Manufacturing, meanwhile, comprises a lower share of liability claims as accidents related to injuries and property damages have declined. In continental Europe, the largest liability insurance markets are Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Together they made up almost USD 22 billion of global liability premiums in 2013. Typically governed by civil law systems, these markets rely on local conditions and historical experience to determine which liability policies and covers are available. Penetration ranges from 0.16% to 0.25%, which is low compared to the common law countries such as the US, the UK and Australia. Japan and Australia are the largest markets in the Asia Pacific region, with commercial liability premiums of USD 6.0 billion and USD 4.8 billion, respectively, in 2013. At 0.12% of GDP, the penetration of liability insurance in Japan is much lower than in other advanced economies. In Australia, penetration is much higher at 0.32% of GDP. This is due to the country‚Äôs English law derived legal framework, which has increased demand for employers‚Äô liability insurance. Australia has mandatory covers for aviation, maritime oil pollution and residential construction and, in certain states, for medical practitioners, property brokers and stock brokers. Liability insurance premiums have grown at an average annual rate of 11% since 2000. China is the ninth largest commercial liability market globally, with premiums of USD 3.5 billion in 2013 and strong annual average growth of 22% since 2000. However, penetration remains low at 0.04% of GDP. Growth has been driven by increasing risk awareness and regulatory changes.  Insurer duties  Liability insurers have one, two or three major duties, depending upon the jurisdiction: # the duty to defend, # the duty to indemnify, and # the duty to settle a reasonably clear claim. = To defend = The duty to defend is prevalent in the United States and Canada, where most liability insurance policies provide that the insurer \\"has the right and duty\\" to defend the insured against all \\"suits\\" to which the policies apply. It is usually triggered when the insured is sued (or in some instances, given pre-suit notice that they are about to be sued) and subsequently \\"tenders\\" defense of the claim to its liability insurer. Usually this is done by sending a copy of the complaint along with a cover letter referencing the relevant insurance policy or policies and demanding an immediate defense. In most U.S. states and Canada, the insurer generally has four main options at this point, to: # defend the insured unconditionally; # defend the insured under a reservation of rights; # seek a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend the claim; or # decline to defend or to seek a declaratory judgment. The duty to defend is generally broader than the duty to indemnify, because most (but not all) policies that provide for such a duty also specifically promise to defend against claims that are groundless, false, or fraudulent. Therefore, the duty to defend is normally triggered by a potential for coverage. The test for a potential for coverage is whether the complaint adequately pleads at least one claim or cause of action which would be covered under the terms of the policy if the plaintiff were to prevail on that claim at trial, and also does not plead any allegations which would entirely vitiate an essential element of coverage or trigger a complete exclusion to coverage. It is irrelevant whether the plaintiff will prevail or actually prevails on the claim; rather, the test is whether the claim if proven would be covered. Vague or ambiguous allegations broad enough to encompass a range of possibilities both within and without coverage are usually construed in favor of a potential for coverage, but speculation about unpled allegations (that is, matters on which the complaint is totally silent) is insufficient to create a potential for coverage. Some jurisdictions allow extrinsic evidence to be considered, either because it is expressly described in the complaint or it is relevant to the facts expressly alleged in the complaint. If there is a duty to defend, it means the insurer must defend the insured against the entire lawsuit even if most of the claims or causes of action in the complaint are clearly not covered. An insurer can choose to defend unconditionally without reserving any rights, but by doing so, it waives (or is later estopped from asserting) the absence of coverage as a defense to the duty to defend and impliedly commits to defending the insured to a final judgment or a settlement regardless of how long it takes (unless the policy expressly provides that defense costs reduce policy limits). In the alternative, the insurer may defend under a reservation of rights: it sends a letter to the insured reserving its rights to immediately withdraw from the insured's defense if it becomes clear there is no coverage or no potential for coverage for the entire complaint, and to recover from the insured any funds expended to that point on defending against any particular claims or causes of action which were never covered or even potentially covered to begin with. If the insurer chooses to defend, it may either defend the claim with its own in-house lawyers (where allowed), or give the claim to an outside law firm on a \\"panel\\" of preferred firms which have negotiated a standard fee schedule with the insurer in exchange for a regular flow of work. The decision to defend under a reservation of rights must be undertaken with extreme caution in jurisdictions where the insured has a right to independent counsel, also known as Cumis counsel. The insurer can also seek a declaratory judgment against the insured that there is no coverage for the claim, or at least no potential for coverage. This option generally allows the insurer to insulate itself from a bad faith claim, in the sense that an insurer acts in good faith when it promptly brings coverage disputes to the attention of a court, even though it also places the insured in the awkward position of defending itself against two lawsuits: the plaintiff's original complaint and the insurer's complaint for declaratory judgment. Indeed, in some jurisdictions an insurer acting in good faith must seek declaratory relief from a court before declining to defend its insured (e.g., Illinois) or withdrawing from its defense pursuant to an earlier reservation of rights (e.g., Georgia). Finally, the insurer can decline to defend and also refrain from seeking declaratory judgment. If the insurer is absolutely certain that there is no coverage or no potential for coverage, then in most jurisdictions the insurer adequately preserves its defenses to coverage by sending a letter to the insured explaining its position and declining to provide a defense. But this option can be very risky, because if a court later determines that there was a duty to defend all along, then it will hold that the insurer necessarily breached that duty, and may also hold that the insurer is subject to tort liability for bad faith. So insurers will often defend under a reservation of rights rather than decline coverage altogether. Outside of the United States and Canada, liability insurers generally do not assume a duty to defend, in the sense of assuming a direct responsibility for hiring and paying a lawyer to defend the insured. Many write policies which promise to reimburse the insured for reasonable defense costs incurred with the insurer's consent, but this is essentially a form of indemnification (covered in the next section below), under which the insured remains primarily responsible for hiring a lawyer to defend themselves. Such insurers often expressly reserve a right to defend the insured, presumably so they can intervene to protect their own interests if the insured's counsel of choice is not providing an adequate defense against the underlying claim. = To indemnify = An indemnity case arises when an individual is obliged to pay for the loss or damage incurred by another person in an event of an accident, collision etc. The duty of indemnity generally originates from the agreement in between insurer and insured which protects the insured against any liability, damage or loss. The duty to indemnify is the insurer's duty to pay all covered sums for which the insured is held liable, up to the limits of coverage and subject to any deductibles, retained limits, self-insured retention, excess payments, or any other amounts of money which the insured is required to pay out-of-pocket as a precondition to the insurer's duty. It is generally triggered when a final judgement is entered against the insured, and it is satisfied when the insurer pays such covered amounts to the plaintiff who obtained the judgement. Most policies provide for payment of monetary damages as well as any costs, expenses, and attorney's fees which the plaintiff may also be entitled to as the prevailing party. Unlike the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify extends only to those claims or causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint which are actually covered under the policy, since a final judgement against the insured would normally be supported by a factual record in the trial court showing exactly why the plaintiff prevailed (or failed to prevail) on each claim or cause of action. Thus, an insurer could have a duty to defend based on mere allegations that show a potential for coverage, but may not have a duty to indemnify if the evidence supporting a final judgement against the insured also takes those claims or causes of action completely outside of the policy's scope of coverage. Conversely, it is also possible that an insurer may have no duty to defend based on the initial allegations of the plaintiff's original complaint, but may have a duty to indemnify based upon the policyholder's proven liability. While the duty to defend and the duty to settle are rare outside of English-speaking North America, the duty to indemnify is universally found in liability insurance policies. = To settle reasonable claims = In some jurisdictions, there is a third duty, the duty to settle a reasonably clear claim against the insured. This duty is generally triggered only if a reasonable opportunity to settle actually arises, either because the plaintiff makes a settlement offer, or the insurer is aware of information to the effect that the plaintiff would accept a settlement offer. The insurer is neither required to initiate an offer to a plaintiff likely to refuse it, nor required to accept an outrageous offer from a plaintiff who filed a frivolous lawsuit and cannot prevail against the insured under any theory. The duty to settle is of greatest import in the scenario where the insured may have some liability exposure (i.e., there is some evidence apparently linking the insured to the plaintiff's alleged injuries), the plaintiff has evidence of substantial damages which may exceed policy limits, and the plaintiff makes a settlement demand (either to the insured or directly to a defending insurer) which equals or exceeds policy limits. In that situation, the insurer's interests conflict with the insured's interests, because the insurer has an incentive to not immediately settle. That is, if the insurer refuses to settle and the case then goes to trial, there are only two possible outcomes: (1) the insured loses and the insurer must pay the ensuing judgment against the insured up to the policy limits, or (2) the insured wins, meaning both the insured and the insurer bear no liability. If the first outcome occurs, then it is essentially \\"nothing gained nothing lost\\" from the insurer's point of view, because either way it will pay out its policy limits. (For simplicity, this analysis disregards sunk costs in the form of defense costs incurred to that point, as well as additional costs sustained by the insurer in defending the insured to a verdict at trial, and opportunity costs sustained by the insured while participating in trial.) While the insurer may be indifferent in this scenario as to whether it pays out its policy limits before or after trial, the insured is most certainly not. If the first outcome above were to occur, the insured may be held liable to the plaintiff for a sum far in excess of both the pretrial settlement offer and the policy limits. Then after the insurer pays out its policy limits, the plaintiff may attempt to recover the remaining balance of the judgment by enforcing writs of attachment or execution against the insured's valuable assets. This is where the duty to settle comes in. To discourage the insurer from gambling with the insured's assets in pursuit of the remote possibility of a defense verdict (under which it can avoid having to pay the plaintiff anything at all), the insurer is subject to a duty to settle reasonably clear claims. The standard judicial test is that an insurer must settle a claim if a reasonable insurer, notwithstanding any policy limits, would have settled the claim. This does not require an insurer to accept or pay settlement offers that actually exceed policy limits, but in that instance, the insurer must discharge its duty to settle by at least making an attempt to bring about a settlement in which it would have to pay only its policy limits (either because the plaintiff agrees to lower their demand or the insured or another primary or excess insurer agrees to contribute the difference). = Effects of breach = Generally, an insurer who breaches any of the foregoing duties will be held liable for breach of contract. In most jurisdictions, the result is a judgment requiring payment of the insured's expectation damages‚Äîthe sums that the insurer should have paid under its duty to indemnify. But this will be circumscribed by the policy limits, and will generally not compensate the insured for losses incurred as a consequence of the insurer's breach, such as lost business opportunities when money intended to be invested in those opportunities was diverted (or seized) to pay judgments. In the United States (and to a lesser extent, Canada), an insurer who breaches any of these three duties in a particularly egregious fashion may also be held liable for the tort of insurance bad faith, under which the insured may be able to recover compensatory damages in excess of the policy limits, as well as punitive damages. = Occurrence v. claims-made policies = Traditionally, liability insurance was written on an occurrence basis, meaning that the insurer agreed to defend and indemnify against any loss which allegedly \\"occurred\\" as a result of an act or omission of the insured during the policy period. This was originally not a problem because it was thought that insureds' tort liability was predictably limited by doctrines like proximate cause and statutes of limitations. In other words, it was thought that no sane plaintiffs' lawyer would sue in 1978 for a tortious act that allegedly occurred in 1953, because the risk of dismissal was so obvious. In the 1970s and 1980s, a large number of major toxic tort (primarily involving asbestos and diethylstilbestrol) and environmental liabilities resulted in numerous judicial decisions and statutes that radically extended the so-called \\"long tail\\" of vulnerable policies. The result was that insurers who had long ago closed their books on policies written 20, 30, or 40 years earlier now found that their insureds were being hit with hundreds of thousands of lawsuits that potentially implicated those old policies. A body of law has developed concerning which policies must respond to these continuous injury or \\"long tail\\" claims, with many courts holding multiple policies may be implicated by the application of an exposure, continuous injury, or injury-in-fact trigger and others holding that only the policy in effect at the time the injuries or damages are discovered is implicated. The insurance industry reacted in two ways to these developments. First, premiums on new occurrence policies skyrocketed, since the industry had come to a better appreciation of the true risks associated with such policy language. Second, the industry began issuing claims-made policies, in which the policy covers only those claims that are first \\"made\\" against the insured during the policy period. A related variation is the claims-made-and-reported policy, in which the policy covers only those claims that are first made against the insured and reported by the insured to the insurer during the policy period (which often include a grace period for reporting after the end of the policy period to protect insureds who are sued at the very end of the policy term). Claims-made policies enable insurers to again sharply limit their own long-term liability on each policy and in turn, to close their books on policies and record a profit. Hence, such policies are much more affordable than occurrence policies and are very popular for that reason. Of course, claims-made policies shift the burden to insureds to immediately report new claims to insurers. They also force insureds to become more proactive about risk management and finding ways to control their own long-tail liability. Claims-made policies often include strict clauses that require insureds to report even potential claims and that combine an entire series of related acts into a single claim. This puts insureds in a position of trading off timely reporting of every \\"potential\\" claim (i.e., every slip-and-fall on their premises), even if those never ripen into actual lawsuits, and thereby protect their right to coverage, at the expense of making themselves look more risky and driving up their own insurance premiums. Or they can wait until they actually get sued, but then they run the risk that the claim will be denied because it should have been reported back when the underlying accident first occurred. Claims-made coverage also makes it harder for insureds to switch insurers, as well as to wind up and shut down their operations. It is possible to purchase \\"tail coverage\\" for such situations, but only at premiums much higher than for conventional claims-made policies, since the insurer is being asked to re-assume the kind of liabilities which claims-made policies were intended to push to insureds to begin with. Not surprisingly, insureds recognized what the insurance industry was up to in trying to use claims-made policies to push a substantial amount of risk back to insureds, and claims- made coverage was the subject of extensive litigation in several countries throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This led to important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, . and 1993Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, . and of the Supreme Court of Canada in 1993.Reid Crowther & Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe & Erie General Insurance Co., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 252. = Retained limits and SIRs = One way for businesses to cut down their liability insurance premiums is to negotiate a policy with a retained limit or self-insured retention (SIR), which is somewhat like a deductible. With such policies, the insured is essentially agreeing to self- insure and self-defend for smaller claims, and to tender and demand a defense only for liability claims that exceed a certain value. However, writing such insurance is itself risky for insurers. The California Courts of Appeal have held that primary insurers on policies with a SIR must still provide an \\"immediate, 'first dollar' defense\\" (subject, of course, to their right to later recover the SIR amount from the insured) unless the policy expressly imposes exhaustion of the SIR as a precondition to the duty to defend.Legacy Vulcan Corp. v. Superior Court, 185 Cal. App. 4th 677, 694-697 (2010).  Types  In many countries, liability insurance is a compulsory form of insurance for those at risk of being sued by third parties for negligence. The most usual classes of mandatory policy cover the drivers of motor vehicles (vehicle insurance), those who offer professional services to the public, those who manufacture products that may be harmful, constructors and those who offer employment. The reason for such laws is that the classes of insured are deliberately engaging in activities that put others at risk of injury or loss. Public policy therefore requires that such individuals should carry insurance so that, if their activities do cause loss or damage to another, money will be available to pay compensation. In addition, there are a further range of perils that people insure against and, consequently, the number and range of liability policies has increased in line with the rise of contingency fee litigation offered by lawyers (sometimes on a class action basis). Such policies fall into three main classes: = Public liability = Industry and commerce are based on a range of processes and activities that have the potential to affect third parties (members of the public, visitors, trespassers, sub-contractors, etc. who may be physically injured or whose property may be damaged or both). It varies from state to state as to whether either or both employer's liability insurance and public liability insurance have been made compulsory by law. Regardless of compulsion, however, most organizations include public liability insurance in their insurance portfolio even though the conditions, exclusions, and warranties included within the standard policies can be a burden. A company owning an industrial facility, for instance, may buy pollution insurance to cover lawsuits resulting from environmental accidents. Many small businesses do not secure general or professional liability insurance due to the high cost of premiums. However, in the event of a claim, out-of-pocket costs for a legal defence or settlement can far exceed premium costs. In some cases, the costs of a claim could be enough to shut down a small business. Businesses must consider all potential risk exposures when deciding whether liability insurance is needed, and, if so, how much coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. Those with the greatest public liability risk exposure are occupiers of premises where large numbers of third parties frequent at leisure including shopping centres, pubs, clubs, theatres, cinemas, sporting venues, markets, hotels and resorts. The risk increases dramatically when consumption of alcohol and sporting events are included. Certain industries such as security and cleaning are considered high risk by underwriters. In some cases underwriters even refuse to insure the liability of these industries or choose to apply a large deductible in order to minimise the potential compensations. Private individuals also occupy land and engage in potentially dangerous activities. For example, a rotten branch may fall from an old tree and injure a pedestrian, and many people ride bicycles and skateboards in public places. The majority of states require motorists to carry insurance and criminalise those who drive without a valid policy. Many also require insurance companies to provide a default fund to offer compensation to those physically injured in accidents where the driver did not have a valid policy. In many countries, claims are dealt with under common law principles established through a long history of case law and if litigated, are made by way of civil actions in the relevant jurisdiction. = Product = Product liability insurance is not a compulsory class of insurance in all countries, but legislation such as the UK Consumer Protection Act 1987 and the EC Directive on Product Liability (25/7/85) require those manufacturing or supplying goods to carry some form of product liability insurance, usually as part of a combined liability policy. The scale of potential liability is illustrated by cases such as those involving Mercedes- Benz for unstable vehicles and Perrier for benzene contamination, but the full list covers pharmaceuticals and medical devices, asbestos, tobacco, recreational equipment, mechanical and electrical products, chemicals and pesticides, agricultural products and equipment, food contamination, and all other major product classes. = Employers and workers compensation = Laws regarding workers compensation, which compensate an employee, vary by country, but the Workers‚Äô Accident Insurance system put into place by Otto von Bismarck in 1881 is often cited as a model for Europe and later the United States. In many legal jurisdictions workers compensation is compulsory depending upon the business, including the United Kingdom and many states of the United States with the notable exception of Texas as of 2018. Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage. Original jurisdiction over workers' compensation claims has been diverted in much of the United States to administrative proceedings outside of the federal and state courts. They operate as no-fault schemes in which the employee need not prove the employer's fault; it is sufficient for the employee to prove that the injury occurred in the course of employment. If a third party other than the employer actually caused the injury, then the workers' compensation insurer (or self- insured employer) who is ordered to pay an employee's claim is usually entitled to initiate a subrogation action in the regular court system against the third party. In turn, workers' compensation insurance is regulated and underwritten separately from liability insurance. Just as the Insurance Services Office develops standard liability insurance forms and obtains approval for them from state insurance commissioners, the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) and various state rating bureaus provide similar services in the workers' compensation context. U.S. workers' compensation insurance generally covers only bodily injury to and death of employees, but it does not always cover other persons who may suffer injury as a direct result of such bodily injury or death. U.S. employers often carry Employers' Liability coverage (which is not necessarily compulsory) to protect themselves from lawsuits from such persons who would still have the right to sue them in the courts, such as an employee's spouse who claims loss of consortium as a result of the employee's bodily injury on the job which was allegedly caused by the employer's negligence. = Management and employment practices liability = Workers' compensation also does not cover intangible torts that merely cause emotional distress, or torts arising from management negligence and liability to shareholders. General management liability coverage may include directors and officers (D&O;) liability insurance, employment practices liability (EPL) insurance, fiduciary liability insurance, and \\"special crime\\" insurance (kidnap, ransom, and extortion), either individually or as part of a cohesive package. Employment practices liability arose in the 1980s, after U.S. employees began to obtain jury verdicts against their employers due to workplace actions such as wrongful dismissal. Insurance Services Office (ISO), a vendor of standard form contract insurance policies, revised the Commercial General Liability insurance policy form to exclude coverage for torts related to the employer-employee relationship like racial or gender discrimination in the workplace, as well as liability for negligent supervision of midlevel managers who committed such torts. Thereafter, specific policy forms were created to cover this specific risk.  General liability  General Liability Insurance is the kind of coverage that provides an individual with protection against variety of claims which may include bodily injuries, physical damage to car, property damage etc arising from business operations. General Liability Insurance (GP) covers a number of businesses and the norms of insurance may vary from company to company as well as area to area. Many of the public and product liability risks are often covered together under a general liability policy. These risks may include bodily injury or property damage caused by direct or indirect actions of the insured. In the United States, general liability insurance coverage most often appears in the Commercial General Liability policies obtained by businesses, and in homeowners' insurance policies obtained by individual homeowners.  Insurable risks  Generally, liability insurance covers only the risk of being sued for negligence or strict liability torts, but not any tort or crime with a higher level of mens rea. This is usually mandated by the policy language itself or case law or statutes in the jurisdiction where the insured resides or does business. In other words, liability insurance does not protect against liability resulting from crimes or intentional torts committed by the insured. This is intended to prevent criminals, particularly organised crime, from obtaining liability insurance to cover the costs of defending themselves in criminal actions brought by the state or civil actions brought by their victims. A contrary rule would encourage the commission of crime, and allow insurance companies to indirectly profit from it, by allowing criminals to insure themselves from adverse consequences of their own actions. Crime is not uninsurable per se. In contrast to liability insurance, it is possible to obtain loss insurance to compensate one's losses as the victim of a crime.  Evidentiary rules  In the United States, most states make only the carrying of motor vehicle insurance mandatory. Where the carrying of a policy is not mandatory and a third party makes a claim for injuries suffered, evidence that a party has liability insurance is generally inadmissible in a lawsuit on public policy grounds, because the courts do not want to discourage parties from carrying such insurance. There are two exceptions to this rule: # If the owner of the insurance policy disputes ownership or control of the property, evidence of liability insurance can be introduced to show that it is likely that the owner of the policy probably does own or control the property. # If a witness has an interest in the policy that gives the witness a motive or bias with respect to specific testimony, the existence of the policy can be introduced to show this motive or bias. Federal rules of civil procedure rule 26 was amended in 1993 to require that any insurance policy that may pay or may reimburse be made available for photocopying by the opposing litigants, although the policies are not normally information given to the jury. Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure rule 46 says that an appeal can be dismissed or affirmed if counsel does not update their notice of appearance to acknowledge insurance. The Cornell University Legal Institute web site includes congressional notes.  In the technology industry  Because technology companies represent a relatively new industry that deals largely with intangible yet highly valuable data, some definitions of legal liability may still be evolving in this field. Technology firms must carefully read and fully understand their policy limits to ensure coverage of all potential risks inherent in their work. Typically, professional liability insurance protects technology firms from litigation resulting from charges of professional negligence or failure to perform professional duties. Covered incidents may include errors and omissions that result in the loss of client data, software or system failure, claims of non-performance, negligent overselling of services, contents of a forum post or email of an employee that are incorrect or cause harm to a reputation, getting rid of office equipment such as fax machines without properly clearing their internal memory, or failing to notify customers that their private data has been breached. For example, some client companies have won large settlements after technology subcontractors‚Äô actions resulted in the loss of irreplaceable data. Professional liability insurance would generally cover such settlements and legal defense, within policy limits. Additionally, client contracts often require technology subcontractors working on-site to provide proof of general liability and professional liability insurance.

Founded in 1989 by Andy Pherson in the basement of the Bridgewater Woolen Mill, the company relocated to its current brewing facility and visitor center in 1995. Originally known as Mountain Brewers, the company changed its name to Long Trail Brewing Company shortly after their relocation to Bridgewater Corners, Vermont. In 2006, Long Trail was acquired by its present owner, Fulham and Co., a Massachusetts-based private equity firm. Located on the banks of the Ottaquechee River in the heart of the Green Mountains, the Long Trail campus includes its brewing operations, visitor center, farmhouse pilot brewery and wastewater treatment facility. Long Trail Ale, a German Altbier, is the company's flagship beer. It is the largest selling craft-brew in Vermont. Beers Long Trail makes a number of different styles of beer, mostly English-style top-fermented ales, but its flagship beer is Long Trail Ale, a D√ºsseldorf-style altbier. It also participates in the tradition of brewing a \\"Sticke\\" Alt (from a dialect German word for secret) known as Long Trail Double Bag, though unlike the German originators of the style, Long Trail makes Double Bag available year-round. During the 1990s it also brewed a K√∂lsch-style ale as a spring seasonal. In the summer of 2006 Long Trail added a hefeweizen to its list of brews. Originally Long Trail's summer seasonal brew, Blackbeary Wheat became a year- round beer in the Fall of 2007. In 2013, the Farmhouse Pilot Brewery introduced the Limbo IPA, which became the first year-round brew produced by the Pilot project. =Brown Bag Series= The Brown Bag concept was developed in 1993 as a way for Long Trail to develop new recipes quickly without the added expense of graphic design and packaging. These small batch brews developed into Long Trail favorites like Double Bag, a year-round Strong Ale and Hit the Trail Ale, a limited release English Brown Ale. Although discontinued in the early 1990s, the Brown Bag Series was revived in October 2012 as a small-batch, limited release series that pays homage to the original Brown Bag concept. Thanks to a small-batch pilot brewing facility on Long Trail's campus, brewers can experiment with recipes on a small scale. The draught is available at the brewery and other establishments throughout the East. Current and past Brown Bag releases include an American IPA, Belgian Smoked Porter, Milk Stout and Maple Maibock (fermented with maple syrup). Distribution Long Trail Brewing Company distributes its product throughout New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia. 45% of its beer is consumed in Vermont. Misc. The brewery's name derives from the Long Trail, a 272-mile hiking trail that snakes through the Green Mountains of Vermont. In 2010, Long Trail Brewing Company acquired Otter Creek Brewing and with it Wolaver's Organic Brewery. The Long Trail Brewery was featured in the Discovery Channel's television show Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe in the Chick Sexer episode #1.7. In August 2014, Long Trail Brewing Company filed a trademark infringement suit against Bent Paddle Brewing Company for using a logo of a hiker with a backpack similar to their own. The suit was amicably settled in December 2014, with Bent Paddle agreeing to discontinue the use of that logo and both breweries making charitable donations to hiking-related groups in one another's states.

The film was shot in Italy in the Stabilimenti Cinematografici Pontini studios near Rome. Plot The Potter family ‚Äì Harry Sr. and Anne with teenage son Harry Jr. and young daughter Wendy ‚Äì move into a new apartment complex in San Francisco. While unpacking, Wendy is attacked by a grotesque little creature wielding a magic ring. The troll captures Wendy and takes on her appearance. After meeting the other eccentric tenants, the family notices Wendy's unusual and aggressive behavior, but they attribute her behavior to the stress of the move. The troll goes from apartment to apartment transforming the tenants into fairy tale creatures (such as goblins, nymphs and elves) and their apartments into lush forests. Concerned by his sister's behavior, Harry Jr. seeks solace in the company of a mysterious old woman named Eunice St. Clair, who reveals herself to be a witch. Long ago, she and a powerful wizard named Torok were in love. At that time, the world was divided between fairies and humans. The realms were equal and independent of each other; however, Torok and some of the fairies challenged this balance, resulting in a great war in which the humans prevailed. Torok was mutated into a troll as punishment. Torok seeks to regain his power, destroy humanity and recreate the fairy tale world he had once lived in. As Torok requires a princess, he is keeping Wendy alive. Eunice and Harry Jr. discover that all the apartments have been transformed into a part of the magical world. Eunice gives Harry Jr. a magic spear capable of killing the largest and most vicious creature in this world. Eunice is attacked by Torok and mutated into a tree stump, and Harry finds his sister trapped in a coffin of glass. Harry Jr. saves Wendy, but loses the magic spear when Torok's great batlike monster attacks. Before the monster can kill Harry Jr. and Wendy, Torok kills it himself to spare Wendy, destroying his carefully constructed fairy realm. As the magic world collapses around them, Harry Jr. and his family are given a chance to escape, leaving just as the police arrive. Eunice is restored to normal as well as she bids Harry farewell and departs. As the police investigate the house, one of them is drawn into a remaining fragment of the alternate fairy world. Torok's arm rises into view, preparing to use his ring on the cop.

Release =Box office= The estimated budget for Troll was between $700,000 and $1.1 million. Troll opened in the U.S. on January 19, 1986 on 959 screens, earning $2,595,054 that weekend. The film placed ninth on the box office charts for opening weekend. =Critical reception= The film received poor reviews by critics, including by Janet Maslin, Patricia Smith, and Alan Carter. Rex Reed had a few positive comments, but was predominantly negative.The New York Times, January 17, 1986; The Chicago Sun-Times, January 20, 1986; The New York Daily News January 17, 1986. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 30% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 3.67/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Despite the negative response, the film did become a cult classic, and an unrelated 1990 movie initially called \\"Goblins\\" was renamed \\"Troll 2\\" in an attempt to misleadingly market itself as a sequel to Troll. =DVD/Blu-ray releases= Troll was released on a double feature DVD with Troll 2 by MGM on August 26, 2003. Scream Factory released a double feature Blu-ray of Troll and Troll 2 on November 17, 2015. The first 5,000 copies included a DVD of Best Worst Movie, the documentary about the production and legacy of Troll 2. Accolades In 1986, Beck was nominated to 8th Youth in Film Association, for the exceptional performance by a Young Actress. Legacy Trolls plot has no relation to the film Troll 2 or the two Troll 3 films, which are intended to be more horror than fantasy. Its first \\"sequel\\", Troll 2, produced under the title Goblins, is considered one of the worst films of all time, and was retitled Troll 2 to cash in on the success of the original. Over time, it has developed a cult following. The films Creepers (also known as Contamination .7 or The Crawlers) and Quest for the Mighty Sword (also known as Ator IV, Ator III: The Hobgoblin, or Hobgoblins) both adopted the name Troll 3 at some point as an alternate title despite neither having a plot relation to the two previous Troll films (with the exception that the Hobgoblin in Quest does resemble the Goblins in Troll 2). In August 2011, rumors circulated of another sequel. In July 2015, new plans arose in the form of a prequel, titled Troll: The Rise of Harry Potter Jr., along with an animated series. The film, starring Patricia Arquette and Baxter Bartlett, was supposed to be released in 2017, with the animated series broadcast on 2018.

Similarity to Harry Potter Since the release of the Harry Potter books starting in 1997, some of those involved in the film have accused J. K. Rowling of \\"borrowing\\" elements from Troll. Producer Charles Band stated in an interview that \\"there are certain scenes in Troll, not to mention the name of the main character, and this of course predates the Harry Potter books by many years. In 2008, John Buechler's partner in the Troll remake, Peter Davy, said about Harry Potter: \\"In John's opinion, he created the first Harry Potter. J. K. Rowling says the idea just came to her.

History 17th- and 18th-century German, Prussian and Swedish fascine knives were more like cavalry swords, often with a brass handle and a hand guard, but later models were more like billhooks in shape and appearance. By the 20th century, it became the Pioneer's billhook in the British Army, used in World War I for making machine gun emplacements. In the Indian Army, it is known as a Knife Gabion (gabions, like fascines, are used for supporting earthworks). Some types of fascine knife are probably descended from 16th century sidearms weapons like the baselard or the Swiss sword. Others, known to British foot soldiers as a billhook, are more closely related to agricultural cutting tools. Uses Like the billhook they were used for cutting saplings (e.g. willow, hazel or chestnut) that were bundled up to make fascines or woven into hurdles, or gabions. Many revetments used a combination of all three, with fascines at the bottom of the trench, hurdles just below ground level and gabions above, filled with the earth from the trench. Although the Spanish Army called its fascine knives machetes, they bore little resemblance to the common cutting tool.

This region overlaps the British and Chilean claims in Antarctica; however, all claims are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty System, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires. Administratively, Argentine Antarctica is a department of the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands. The provincial authorities reside in Ushuaia and the Governor annually designates his or her delegate for the Antarctica region.

Jos√© Mar√≠a Sobral was the first Argentine to set foot on Antarctica in 1902, where he spent 2 seasons with the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of Doctor Otto Nordenski√∂ld. Shortly afterwards, in 1904, the Orcadas permanent base was already fully operational. Years later other bases would be created, some permanent and others seasonal. The first Argentine expedition to reach the South Pole was the 1965 Operaci√≥n 90. Argentine activities in Antarctica are coordinated by the Instituto Ant√°rtico Argentino (IAA) and Direcci√≥n Nacional del Ant√°rtico (DNA). The estimated Argentine Antarctica area is , of which is land. The ice in the glacier shell has a thickness of 2 km on average. Temperatures range from 0 ¬∞C in summer and -60 ¬∞C in winter although in certain points may drop to approximately -82 ¬∞C. Time zone UTC-3 is used as in the South American continent. Argentina has six permanent Antarctic Stations and seven Summer Stations with a total of 13. According to the last Argentine national census, in October 2010 (winter) there were 230 inhabitants (including 9 families and 16 children) at the six permanent bases: 75 at Marambio, 66 at Esperanza, 33 at Jubany, 20 at San Mart√≠n, 19 at Belgrano II and 17 at Orcadas.Censo 2010: en la Ant√°rtida viven 230 personas, 9 familias y 16 ni√±os (in Spanish)  History  = First expeditions = In 1815 Guillermo Brown, an Irish Marine Commodore in the service of the United Provinces of R√≠o de la Plata, launched a campaign to harass the Spanish fleet in the Pacific Ocean. When rounding Cape Horn aboard the Hercules and Trinidad, strong winds pushed them to parallel 65 S. Some Argentine sources say that Brown had sighted Antarctic land on the expedition, saying that is the reason why in Argentina cartography often called the northernmost part of the Antarctic Peninsula Tierra de la Trinidad.Acciones navales de la rep√∫blica Argentina, 1813‚Äì1828. p. 18.

The Argentine sealer Santo Spiritu under Captain Carlos Tidblom, was followed in September 1819 from the Falkland Islands by the American brig Hercilia (commanded by Nathaniel Palmer) catching up on Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands. T On 10 June 1829 the government of the province of Buenos Aires issued a decree creating the Political-Military Command of the Malvinas Islands (see Louis Vernet) including the islands adjacent to Cape Horn, which plays in Argentina and that included the Antarctic islands.

This Argentine receive support in exchange for incorporating an Argentine Navy to dispatch and deliver scientific data and zoological collections that pick. On their way through Buenos Aires lieutenant Jose Maria Sobral boarded the ship Antarctic on 21 December 1901. As no news of the expedition reached the Argentine government, it then fulfilled its commitment to support the expedition by renovating the corvette ARA Uruguay, which then set out on search on 8 October 1903, under the command of Lieutenant Juli√°n Irizar, finding and rescuing members of the expedition who had been wintering following the collapse of the Antarctic. The expedition built a hut on Snow Hill Island in 1902. The Argentine Navy took possession of the hut in 1954 and named it Refugio Suecia.

Thanks to Argentine collaboration with his expedition, Charcot named an insular group as Argentine Islands. One of these islands was named as Galindez Island in honor of the captain of the Corvette, Ismael Gal√≠ndez, and another was named Uruguay Island, in homage to the Argentine Corvette.Islas Argentinas The Argentine Government decided to add two meteorological observatories, in the South Georgia Island and Wandel Island, who already had on the islands Laurie and Observatorio (near Isla de los Estados). Expeditions to the Wandel Island failed in two attempts. In June 1905 the transport ARA Guardia Nacional under the command of the Lieutenant Alfredo P.

On 30 March 1927 the first radiotelegraph station in Antarctica was inaugurated in the South Orkney Islands . On 15 December 1927 the General Directorate of post and Telegraph from Argentina informed to the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union about their Antarctic claims and other islands of the South Atlantic. In 1939, Argentina created temporarily (to attend a Norwegian invitation) the National Commission of the Antarctic by Decree number 35821, but by the Decree number 61852 of 30 April 1940 became a permanent body in order to intensify research in the area. Explorations, scientific tasks, were gathering ground and marking. In October 1941, the Instituto Geogr√°fico Militar published maps showing the extent of the future Argentine claim between the 25¬∞ W and 75 ¬∞ W. In January 1942 the Argentine Government, according to the theory of polar sectors, said their Antarctic rights between the Meridian 25¬∞ and 68¬∞24' West (of Punta D√∫ngeness). Argentina held at Deception Island its formal takeover of the Antarctic land on 8 November 1942, by placing a cylinder containing a report and a flag left there by an expedition under the command of the captain Alberto J. Oddera. In January 1943 the British ship HMS Carnarvon Castle crew destroyed the evidence of the Argentine inauguration and planted the British flag and sent to Buenos Aires the Act. On 5 March of that year the Argentine vessel ARA 1¬∞ de Mayo removed the British flag.Passing Deception Island In 1946, the National Antarctic Commission set new limits for the Argentine Antarctica between the Meridian 25¬∞ and 74¬∞ West (of the far east of the South Sandwich Islands). Chile and Argentina signed on 4 March 1948 a mutual agreement protecting and defending legal rights territorial Antarctic, mutually recognizing their claims. On 7 April 1948, by Decree No. 9905 settled the administrative unit of the Argentine Antarctic Sector of the maritime Governor of the National Territory of Tierra del Fuego.

On 4 May 1955 the United Kingdom filed two lawsuits against Argentina and Chile respectively, the International Court of Justice in The Hague so this declared the invalidity of claims of sovereignty of the two countries on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic areas. On 15 July 1955, the Chilean Government rejected the jurisdiction of the Court in that case and on 1 August the Argentine Government did the same, by what the demands on 16 March 1956 they were archived. On 1 December 1959 was signed the Antarctic Treaty by Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States, entering into force on 23 June 1961. In the 1960s the State of Argentina, with its fleet, pioneered ecological tourist cruises to Antarctica. At the same time, the Argentine State-owned Aerolineas Argentinas inaugurated passenger flights between Ushuaia and Sydney making scale in Marambio Base. Between the mid-1960s and the first half of the 1970s Argentina launched rockets from its Antarctic bases. These rockets were designed and built entirely in the Argentina and possessed meteorological instrumentation and radiation sensors. Operaci√≥n 90 was the first Argentine ground expedition to the South Pole, conducted in 1965, by ten soldiers of the Argentine Army under then-Colonel Jorge Edgard Leal. The operation was named for the target 90 degree South latitude point (the geographic South Pole).\\"Operaci√≥n 90: La llegada al Polo Sur por v√≠a terrestre\\" by Jorge Edgard Leal (Click on Llegada al Polo (terrestre) on the column at the left) Esperanza Base in 2012. On 8 April 1970, the Governor of Tierra del Fuego issued the Decree N ¬∞ 149 creating 4 departments, among them the Argentine Antarctic Sector Department. In 1977 the Esperanza Base was elected to as the place of filing of Argentine families that traveled at the end of that year to overwinter at the base. The first director of the Argentine Antarctic Institute, general Hern√°n Pujato, was the forerunner of the installation of the Fort√≠n Sargento Cabral when on 13 August 1954 he proposed the Argentine Government create a farmhouse out cape Spring to populate it with family groups.

His baptism in the Catholic chapel on 7 January 1978 was the first on the continent. On 18 December 2012, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory (and Argentine Antarctica) has been named Queen Elizabeth Land in honour of Queen Elizabeth II. Argentina, which lays claim to part of the area, criticised the naming. In 2013 the Argentine Defense Ministry announced that Petrel Base will become a permanent base by 2015.

The highest peaks are located at the south of the Antarctic Peninsula, which has islands and archipelagos nearby. The land is under an ice sheet. =Climate= The climate of the region ranges from a subpolar climate in the north to a polar climate in the south. The region has an extremely cold climate with mean temperatures below with frost and snowfall occurring throughout the year. In general, there are two different climatic zones found within the region: a glacial climate in the interior and an oceanic one in the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands. The glacial climate found in the interior is dominated by continental ice sheets and glaciers while in the Antarctic Peninsula and its adjacent islands, the climate is characterized by very strong winds, particularly in winter. In particular, the Antarctic Peninsula experiences strong cold winds and blizzards. In the interior of the continent, the climate is colder and drier due to the higher latitude, altitude, and strong continental influences. Mean annual temperatures range from between in the Antarctic Peninsula to in the interior. Temperatures are always low in the region; during the polar night in winter, temperatures drop down to . In the warmest month, mean temperatures are usually below . Coastal areas have mean temperatures in the warmest month at around freezing. Precipitation mainly falls as snow. Due to the ice sheets and glaciers covering most of the region and the severity of the climate, the flora is sparse and limited only to coastal areas. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" align=\\"left\\" style=\\" margin:1em; padding:0.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:3px; font-size:100%\\" + colspan=\\"14\\" style=\\"background: orange; text-align:center;\\" Average Temperatures in selected locations in ¬∞C (¬∞F) - align=\\"center\\" !

Esperanza and Marambio are the biggest Argentine bases, holding together 70 buildings, an average of 110 people during the winter, and over a maximum of 250 during the summer. Orcadas Base, located at the South Orkney Islands off the Antarctic mainland (see map, right), was the world's first base in the Antarctic region, operating continuously since 1903. The southernmost Argentine permanent base is Belgrano II, at over 77 degrees south. Another site, Belgrano III, was closed in 1984 due to deterioration of the ice barrier. The southernmost summer base is Sobral, at from Belgrano II. The bases are supplied by the ships: Puerto Deseado, Suboficial Castillo, and Almirante Irizar, and by C-130 Hercules and DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. =Permanent= Belgrano II, ().

Argentine Antarctic claims are based on historical and geological considerations: Argentina's continued human presence since 1904, and the proximity to the South American continental part of Argentina. The exercise of sovereignty over Argentine Antarctica made effective in all aspects that are not limited by the signing of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959.La Ant√°rtica Chilena. p. 173. Escrito por Oscar Pinochet de la Barra. Publicado por Andr√©s Bello, 1976 According to historical claims, the Argentine presence in the section began during the first decade of the 20th century; though some even affirm that it took place by the end of the previous century. However, navigators from other countries claimed the discovery of Antarctica for themselves. By the end of the 20th century the aid lent by Argentina to foreign expeditions, in particular that of Nordenski√∂ld, Gerlache and Charcot, was properly appreciated. This included the assignment of Argentine place names to Antarctic geographic features, such as the Argentine Islands, Uruguay Islands, General Roca, Quintana, and others. In 1904, the permanent occupation began with the opening of Orcadas Base on Laurie Island just off the Antarctic mainland. Argentina was the only nation to have an Antarctic base for 40 years until the British built a base on the same islands. Argentina bases its claims on this sector of Antarctica on the following grounds: * The Antarctic peninsula is geologically and geographically part of the Andes. * Argentina has maintained a permanent occupation for more than a century, and controls the oldest base in Antarctica (Orcadas Station on Laurie Island). * Argentina conducts many rescue missions in Antarctica. * Argentina has constructed lighthouses and other navigational aids in Antarctica. * Argentina constructed Antarctica's first airport in 1969. * Argentines form more of Antarctica's peninsula's population than nationals of any other country. * The first Antarctican was born in Esperanza Base (Hope Base), namely Emilio Palma. * Argentina has sent more people to Antarctica than all the other countries together. (in Spanish) Argentina's claim to the Antarctic Peninsula overlaps with the Antarctic claims of Chile, 53¬∞W to 90¬∞W, and the UK claims, 20¬∞W to 80¬∞W. Currently, there are no attempts by Argentina or any other country to enforce territorial claims in Antarctica. See List of Antarctic territorial claims. None of these claims have international recognition and have been suspended by the Antarctic Treaty in 1961.  Demographics  Children, teenagers and teachers of the school of Esperanza Base.

She was named for the home of Thomas Jefferson. She was briefly named Star in May 1861. Monticello was built at Mystic, Connecticut, in 1859; chartered by the Navy in May 1861; and purchased on 12 September 1861 at New York from H. P. Cromwell & Company, for service in the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Captain Henry Eagle in command. Service history Colored print of Monticello, ca. 1860s Monticello was renamed Star on 3 May 1861, but resumed her original name on 23 May. Seeing immediate action, Monticello relieved in blockading the James River and preventing communication with the Elizabeth River on 2 May, then relieved at Cape Henry on the 8th. She engaged the batteries at Sewell's Point from 10 to 14 May, then continued blockade duty until steaming up the Rappahannock to Smith's Island on 24 June. Operating with the Army on the James River above Newport News, Virginia on 5 July, she dispersed a body of Confederate cavalry. Often engaging Confederate batteries through the remainder of 1861, she was in the squadron that captured the batteries at Hatteras Inlet on 28‚Äì29 August in the first significant Union victory, one which greatly encouraged the North. She drove off Confederates attacking Union soldiers in that area on 5 October. Departing Baltimore, Maryland on 25 March 1862 for the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina, Monticello sent a boat party to the expedition up Little River on 26 June that destroyed two schooners. She engaged the batteries at New Inlet on 12 July, and took British schooner Revere off Wilmington on 11 October 1862. After relieving on blockade at Shallow Inlet on 15 November, Monticello destroyed British schooners Ariel and Ann there the 24th. Monticello operated around Little River through 1863, taking British schooner Sun on 30 March, and steamer Old Fellow on 15 April. She joined the expedition to Murrell's Inlet on 25 April, and shelled a schooner there on 12 May with . In November, she destroyed salt works near Little River Inlet. Returning to the Wilmington blockade in January 1864, she joined in the expedition to Smithville, North Carolina (now the town of Southport) on 29 February, capturing Captain Patrick Kelly of General Louis Hebert's staff. In July, she joined in the chase after , and on 24 August attacked Confederate batteries at Masonboro Inlet. Monticello participated in the attacks on Fort Fisher on 24‚Äì25 December and on 13‚Äì14 January 1865. She took the surrender of Fort Casswell on 18‚Äì19 January, then participated in the Little River expedition of 4‚Äì6 February. After the war, Monticello decommissioned on 24 July 1865 at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and was sold at public auction at Boston, Massachusetts to W. H. Lincoln on 1 November. Redocumented for merchant service on 25 July 1866, she served American commerce until foundering off Newfoundland on 29 April 1872.

The riverbank was strengthened with fascines. A fascine is a rough bundle of brushwood or other material used for strengthening an earthen structure, or making a path across uneven or wet terrain. Typical uses are protecting the banks of streams from erosion, covering marshy ground and so on. In war they are often used to create paths for tanks and other vehicles across uneven terrain. Early military use chandeliers stacked with fascines. Fascine bundles were used in military defences for revetting (shoring up) trenches or ramparts, especially around artillery batteries, or filling in ditches from earlier military actions. They were also used as a visual obstruction, providing cover for sappers and engineers. Military fascine bridges were used on a regular basis by the Romans to cross obstacles. Subsequently, the use of fascines by military engineers continued almost wherever armies were deployed. World Wars Mark V tanks carrying crib fascines, 1918. A Churchill tank, carrying a fascine, crosses a ditch using an already deployed fascine, 1943. First World War tanks, namely the British Mark IV, started the practice of carrying fascines on the roof, to be deployed to fill trenches that would otherwise be an obstacle to the tank.First World War - The Tank: New Developments - Willmott, H.P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003, Page 222 These were constructed from the traditional bundles of brushwood used to make fascines since Roman times. Although these were cumbersome to deploy they proved an effective gap-crossing device and were used widely by the tanks of the day that weighed up to about 30 tons. In World War II the use of fascines continued as a gap-crossing device and within the British Army these were launched from the Churchill AVRE - a Royal Engineer derivative of the standard Churchill tank (40 tons). The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) pre-positioned fascines made of metal pipes across the Khalkha River (between Japanese held Manchuria and Mongolia, the USSR's protectorate,) in advance of the IJA's 1939 foray into Mongolia. The use of hollow pipes had been predicated on their ability to allow water flow; the pipes were secured such that they were awash, and the river's unimpeded flow initially hid the fascines from Soviet reconnaissance aircraft. While these fascines were designed for stealth rather than combat deployment and were not deployed via armoured vehicles, the use of hollow pipes as fascines was a significant step forward. Developments since World War II The pipe fascine was further developed in the British Army in the early 1980s to meet the challenges of assuring the mobility of movement in West Germany in the event of a NATO conflict with the Warsaw Pact. Single fascine launch near Hannover - Centurion AVRE The majority of obstacles to mobility in West Germany run north‚Äìsouth, and movement by military forces would have been east‚Äìwest. Within the area of operation of the British Army, near Hannover, there is a significant number of smaller gaps, mainly drainage ditches, streams and small rivers approximately 5‚Äì10 m wide and 1.5 ‚Äì 2.5 m deep that are sufficient to stop armoured vehicles. Given the low number of AVLBs available, a solution was needed to bridge these gaps quickly and cheaply and under fire. In earlier wars, wooden fascines had been used, but these were ineffective for use with the much heavier modern vehicles, some of which weighed up to 70 tons. The Royal Engineers Experimental Establishment at Christchurch did initial tests on the possible use of 9-inch high-density plastic pipes held together with chains. These would allow water flow, and not be damaged with the higher modern vehicle weight. Further development was done by Lt C Roebuck RE and his troop, 5 Troop, 31 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 32 Armoured Engineer Regiment at Munsterlager, North Germany in 1981/2, to enable full acceptance and provide user instructions for operational use. This development involved testing in different gaps and conditions, e.g. concrete line canals to earth banked rural field drainage channels, possibility of multiple fascine use in a single gap and launch testing both day, night and in limited visibility. During the trials the development team drivers became skilled at the launching of the fascine and were able to launch two or even three fascines into a single gap. However for regular operational use by less skilled crews it was recommended that only single fascines should be used as the use of 2nd or 3rd fascines required the launch vehicle to launch the subsequent fascine whilst on the potentially unstable first fascine. This required a perfect launch to ensure the second fascine was quickly in place to make the first fascine stable and held in position. If this did not happen there was potentially significant risk to the launch vehicle and crew especially in water filled gaps. A launch technique was developed: approach the target gap at speed, line up onto alignment/ launch markers, drive over first marker then brake sharply at second marked point and fire the explosive bolts holding the travel hawsers so that the fascine, through inertia, rolled off the directly into the middle of the gap. When in position, they travel over it to level the road surface for other vehicles to cross. This whole process would take less than a minute, essential for an assault crossing possibly under fire. Combat Engineer Tractor launch The fascine was subsequently accepted into service and used successfully in a number of operational and non-operational roles using the Centurion AVRE, a Centurion tank derivative with a bulldozer blade and 165mm demolition gun fitted. It was used in combat for the first time during the First Iraq war to breach anti tank ditches. The British Army now use the Trojan, based on the Challenger 2 tank, to carry and deploy pipe fascines.

She traps the kids in a cage down in her laboratory, plotting to use them as subjects for her zombie-making experimentation, so she can test out a drug she is working on for an unnamed foreign nation. Although the film's credits include a 1957 copyright statement for G.B.M. Productions, the film was never registered for copyright.  Plot  While taking their boat out for some water-skiing, a quartet of teens named Reg (Don Sullivan), Skip (Paul Pepper), Julie (Mitzie Albertson), and Pam (Brianne Murphy) accidentally discover an island run by a mad scientist named Doctor Myra (Katherine Victor) who, backed by foreign agents from \\"the East\\", intends to turn everyone in the United States into mindlessly obedient zombies. The teenagers are captured by the hulking, bearded zombie Ivan (Chuck Niles) and imprisoned in cages down in Myra's basement, but the boys manage to escape, planning to find a way off the island and then come back to rescue the girls. When a couple of their young friends arrive with the local sheriff to save them, he turns out to be in league with Myra and has been supplying her with victims for her experiments. A complicated fight scene serves as the climax, in which a previously zombified gorilla arrives just in time to attack Myra's henchmen and allow the teens to escape. They find Myra attempting to steal their boat and manage to capture her for the police. After they are safely back on the mainland and the proper authorities informed, it is implied that the teens will receive a reward for discovering the island and will have an audience with the President of the United States.

Originally built in 1900, demolished and built again in 1960, it then underwent a further rebuilding in 1998 (the present one). It now holds up to 1,200 worshippers. Non-Muslims are permitted to enter the Mosque daily from Sunday to Thursday from 9am to 1130am for free tours. The mosque is the hub of Dubai‚Äôs religious and cultural life. History The mosque was originally a school devoted to study of the Qur'an, known as a kuttab, which welcomed its first students in the year 1900 to learn the Qur'an by rote. This building was replaced by a new mosque on the same site in 1960, which in turn was itself rebuilt in 1998, closer in style to the original of 1900. This mosque is one of the largest in Dubai and is dominant edifice in the old city. Architecture The tallest feature of the mosque is the minaret, the tallest in Dubai, which resembles a lighthouse. The sandy- grey walls are generally unadorned, but there is a large Quranic inscription inlaid above the five columns of the entrance facade, which sit at the top of a short flight of six steps. The 45 small and nine larger domes with the tall minaret cover the roof of the Grand Mosque. The wooden windows are fitted with hand-made stained glass and blend well with the old town of Bur Dubai, and its minaret is designed in Anatolian architectural style.

He is the son of Blackjack Mulligan and the brother of Barry Windham. He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling. Professional wrestling career = Championship Wrestling from Florida (1985-1987) = Kendall Windham started wrestling in 1985 for Championship Wrestling from Florida. He was very skinny but had the same moves and looks as his older brother, Barry. In his early days, he was a good guy (face) and teamed with Barry to feud with Ron Bass, Jack Hart and Kevin Sullivan's \\"cult\\". His biggest singles feuds were with White Ninja AKA Great Muta and The Cuban Assassin. He traded the Florida Heavyweight Title a few times with each of them. = Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1987-1989) = In 1987, he ventured to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions where he teamed with The Italian Stallion and feuded with the MOD Squad, Spike & Basher. He never got above preliminary status and went to WCCW briefly at the end of 1988. In January 1989, he was back in the NWA teaming with another second generation wrestler, Dustin Rhodes, as the \\"Texas Broncos\\". In a match aired on January 28, 1989, Kendall teamed with Eddie Gilbert against his brother Barry and James J. Dillon of the Four Horsemen. Kendall turned on Gilbert and joined Barry and held up the four fingers to the camera. Before the next show, Dillon left for the WWF and the Horsemen name was dropped. The Windhams and Flair were given a new manager, Hiro Matsuda, and a new stable name, \\"Yamasaki Corporation\\". Kendall stayed with the stable (which grew to include Butch Reed and Michael Hayes) until the summer, when he left for Florida again. = Championship Wrestling from Florida (1989-1990) = On June 27, 1989, Windham won the FCW Heavyweight Championship from Dustin Rhodes. He obtained a new manager, Oliver Humperdink, and feuded with Rhodes. He soon left Humperdink for Robert Fuller's Stud Stable and by the end of 1989, was a member of Ron Slinker's \\"Strike Command\\". In 1990, he left Slinker and teamed with Fuller to win the Tag Team Titles, Upon losing them, they split and feuded. = Various promotions = Windham returned to wrestling in 1992 for Florida's ICWA promotion where he feuded with Pat Tanaka. He had put on some more weight in prison and was considered a heavyweight instead of a light heavyweight. He teamed with Dan Spivey for a tour of All Japan Pro Wrestling and spent a little time in WCW in 1994 and ECW in 1995. = World Championship Wrestling (1997-1999) = Windham returned to WCW in 1997 with his head shaved and feuded with Chris Adams and Jim Duggan. In 1999, when WCW created a hardcore division, he entered it briefly and feuded with Hardcore Hak. In June, Windham joined The West Texas Rednecks in what would be the biggest push of his career. The Rednecks were his brother Barry, Curt Hennig and Bobby Duncum Jr.. They were supposed to be heels feuding with Master P's rappers, the \\"No Limit Soldiers\\", but the southern fans of WCW cheered the Rednecks instead. The angle was quickly dropped and they moved on to a feud with \\"Harlem Heat\\" (Booker T and Stevie Ray). Kendall and Barry defeated Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Title's but lost them back to Harlem Heat three weeks later. = Late career (1999-2002) = By the end of 1999, they all had left WCW and Kendall worked for Ted DiBiase's promotion WXO, WWC (where he won the tag title with Barry) and All Japan Pro Wrestling where he closed out his career tagging with his brother Barry in the AJPW Real World Tag League 2000. Kendall Windhams last match took place on December 16, 2000 where he and his brother Barry Windham lost the WWC Tag Team Titles to the team of Thunder 'N' Lightning. Windham retired in 2002.

It is located at the feet of the Hyblaean Mountains, some from Caltagirone. History The town was built in 1693, after the destruction by an earthquake of the old town of Occhial√†, located to the north of the modern Grammichele. Occhial√†, which, on account of the similarity of name, is generally identified with Echetla, a frontier city between Syracusan and Carthaginian territory in the time of Hiero II, and which appears to have been originally a Sicel city in which Greek civilization prevailed from the 5th century onwards. Being laid out on a hexagonal street plan, it is one of several Val di Noto towns with distinctive layouts.

A smaller and more minor water spot caused by rainwater leaking through a roof. Water damage describes various possible losses caused by water intruding where it will enable attack of a material or system by destructive processes such as rotting of wood, mold growth, bacteria growth, rusting of steel, swelling of composite woods, de-laminating of materials such as plywood, and many others. The damage may be imperceptibly slow and minor such as water spots that could eventually mar a surface, or it may be instantaneous and catastrophic such as burst pipes and flooding. However fast it occurs, water damage is a major contributor to loss of property. An insurance policy may or may not cover the costs associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a common cause of residential water damage is often the failure of a sump pump, many homeowner's insurance policies do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which adds to the monthly premium of the policy. Often the verbiage of this addendum is similar to \\"Sewer and Drain Coverage\\". In the United States, those individuals who are affected by wide- scale flooding may have the ability to apply for government and FEMA grants through the Individual Assistance program. On a larger level, businesses, cities, and communities can apply to the FEMA Public Assistance program for funds to assist after a large flood. For example, the city of Fond du Lac Wisconsin received $1.2 million FEMA grant after flooding in June 2008. The program allows the city to purchase the water damaged properties, demolish the structures, and turn the former land into public green space.  Causes  Water damage can originate by different sources such as a broken dishwasher hose, a washing machine overflow, a dishwasher leakage, broken/leaking pipes, flood waters, groundwater seepage, building envelope failures (leaking roof, windows, doors, siding, etc.) and clogged toilets. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 13.7% of all water used in the home today can be attributed to plumbing leaks. http://www.epa.gov/watersense/our_water/water_use_today.html On average that is approximately 10,000 gallons of water per year wasted by leaks for each US home. A tiny, 1/8-inch crack in a pipe can release up to 250 gallons of water a day.The University of Maine Corporate Extension ‚Äì www.umext.maine.edu According to Claims Magazine in August 2000, broken water pipes ranked second to hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the amount of claims (on average $50,000 per insurance claim) costs in the US. Experts suggest that homeowners inspect and replace worn pipe fittings and hose connections to all household appliances that use water at least once a year. This includes washing machines, dishwashers, kitchen sinks, and bathroom lavatories, refrigerator icemakers, water softeners, and humidifiers. A few US companies offer whole-house leak protection systems utilizing flow-based technologies. A number of insurance companies offer policyholders reduced rates for installing a whole-house leak protection system. As far as insurance coverage is concerned, damage caused by surface water intrusion to the dwelling is considered flood damage and is normally excluded from coverage under traditional homeowners' insurance. Surface water is water that enters the dwelling from the surface of the ground because of inundation or insufficient drainage and causes loss to the dwelling. Coverage for surface water intrusion to the dwelling would usually require a separate flood insurance policy.  Categories  There are three basic categories of water damage, based on the level of contamination. Category 1 Water - Refers to a source of water that does not pose substantial threat to humans and classified as \\"clean water\\". Examples are broken water supply lines, tub or sink overflows or appliance malfunctions that involves water supply lines. Category 2 Water - Refers to a source of water that contains a significant degree of chemical, biological or physical contaminants and causes discomfort or sickness when consumed or even exposed to. Known as \\"grey water\\". This type carries microorganisms and nutrients of micro-organisms. Examples are toilet bowls with urine (no feces), sump pump failures, seepage due to hydrostatic failure and water discharge from dishwashers or washing machines. Category 3 Water - Known as \\"black water\\" and is grossly unsanitary. This water contains unsanitary agents, harmful bacteria and fungi, causing severe discomfort or sickness. Type 3 category are contaminated water sources that affect the indoor environment. This category includes water sources from sewage, seawater, rising water from rivers or streams, storm surge, ground surface water or standing water. Category 2 Water or Grey Water that is not promptly removed from the structure and or have remained stagnant may be re classified as Category 3 Water. Toilet back flows that originates from beyond the toilet trap is considered black water contamination regardless of visible content or color.  Classes  Class of water damage is determined by the probable rate of evaporation based on the type of materials affected, or wet, in the room or space that was flooded. Determining the class of water damage is an important first step, and will determine the amount and type of equipment utilized to dry-down the structure. Class 1 - Slow Rate of Evaporation. Affects only a portion of a room. Materials have a low permeance/porosity. Minimum moisture is absorbed by the materials. IICRC s500 2016 update adds that class 1 be indicated when <5% of the total square footage of a room (ceiling+walls+floor) are affected  Class 2 - Fast Rate of Evaporation. Water affects the entire room of carpet and cushion. May have wicked up the walls, but not more than 24 inches. IICRC s500 2016 update adds that class 2 be indicated when 5% to 40% of the total square footage of a room (ceiling+walls+floor) are affected  Class 3 - Fastest Rate of Evaporation. Water generally comes from overhead, affecting the entire area; walls, ceilings, insulation, carpet, cushion, etc. IICRC s500 2016 update adds that class 3 be indicated when >40% of the total square footage of a room (ceiling+walls+floor) are affected  Class 4 - Specialty Drying Situations. Involves materials with a very low permeance/porosity, such as hardwood floors, concrete, crawlspaces, gypcrete, plaster, etc. Drying generally requires very low specific humidity to accomplish drying.  Restoration  Water damage restoration can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional water damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore water damaged property. Certified professional water damage restoration specialists utilize psychrometrics to monitor the drying process. = Standards and regulation = While there are currently no government regulations in the United States dictating procedures, two certifying bodies, the Institute of Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) and the RIA, do recommend standards of care. The current IICRC standard is ANSI/IICRC S500-2015. It is the collaborative work of the IICRC, SCRT, IEI, IAQA, and NADCA. Fire and Water Restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state's Department of Consumer Affairs - usually the state contractors license board. In California, all Fire and Water Restoration companies must register with the California Contractors State License Board. Presently, the California Contractors State License Board has no specific classification for \\"water and fire damage restoration.\\" = Procedures = Water damage restoration is often prefaced by a loss assessment and evaluation of affected materials. The damaged area is inspected with water sensing equipment such as probes and other infrared tools in order to determine the source of the damage and possible extent of areas affected. Emergency mitigation services are the first order of business. Controlling the source of water, removal of non-salvageable materials, water extraction and pre-cleaning of impacted materials are all part of the mitigation process. Restoration services would then be rendered to the property in order to dry the structure, stabilize building materials, sanitize any affected or cross-contaminated areas, and deodorize all affected areas and materials. After the labor is completed, water damage equipment including air movers, air scrubbers, dehumidifiers, wood floor drying systems, and sub-floor drying equipment is left in the residence. The goal of the drying process is to stabilize the moisture content of impacted materials below 15%, the generally accepted threshold for microbial amplification. Industry standards state that drying vendors should return at regular time intervals, preferably every twenty-four hours, to monitor the equipment, temperature, humidity, and moisture content of the affected walls and contents.

It can also be an inability to continue or complete a train of thought, as in the case of writer's block. In the case of writer's block, many find it helpful to take a break and revisit their topic. Another tactic that is used when people with mental blocks are learning new information is repetition. A similar phenomenon occurs when one cannot solve a problem in mathematics which one will normally consider it as simple. Mental blocks can be caused by physical disabilities or simply a lack of focus. Mental blocks are also often used to describe a temporary inability to recall a name or other information. A sudden cessation of speech or a thought process without an immediate observable cause, sometimes can be considered a consequence of repression. Mental blocking can be a coping mechanism for mental illnesses such as hysteria, neurosis, and lack of pathology. Incidental forgetting Forgetting curve could be associated with mental blocking. The forgetting curve was first described by Ebbinghaus as the natural loss of memory retention over time. Memories can also simply disappear over time from Trace decay which is the weakening of memories over time. This kind of decay stems from both the visual and verbal working memory. Although the triggers decay, some of the information remains stored. Interference is the phenomenon that a memory can be distorted due to the existence of related memories when it comes to retrieval.  Associative blocking  Associative blocking is explained as the effects of an interference during a retrieval. Associative blocking can be caused by failure of cues that a specific target, this is because the cue is being replaced by a new cue that grows stronger. This causes the initial cue to deteriorate because each separated memory is competing for first access to the conscious when the shared cue is presented.  Unlearning  Unlearning is associated with two separate stimuli that are attached to a memory trace, the trace is then weakened because it isn't accessed often enough. When one attempted to recover said memory there is an error that happens when a different cue is presented.  Motivated forgetting  Directed forgetting is another name for Motivated Forgetting, meaning that one is forgetting consciously any recent experience that was unwanted. Cognitive control is known as the ability to access thoughts and memories, but as well as the ability to have control over unwanted thoughts surfacing from the unconscious. This kind of suppression can be linked to the think/no think (TNT) paradigm, which is practice that is designed to remind one of undesired life experiences that result in unwanted feelings, such as a first heartbreak, that one would normally try to avoid thinking about. Also, repression a Freudian theory theorizes that it is a defense mechanism that destroys undesired feelings, ideas, and memories in the unconscious. This defense mechanism is due to the attempt to resolve and eliminate psychological hurt. When unwelcome reminders occur, people often try to exclude the unwanted memory from awareness. Stopping retrieval of an unwanted memory is known as ‚Äòretrieval suppression‚Äô, a process that engages response override mechanisms formally similar to stopping a reflexive motor action.

Chopin completed the work while living in George Sand's manor in Nohant, some south of Paris, a year before it was published in 1840. The first of the composer's three mature sonatas (the others being the Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58 and the Sonata for Piano and Cello in G minor, Op. 65), the work is considered to be one of the greatest piano sonatas of the literature. The third movement of the Piano Sonata No. 2 is Chopin's famous funeral march () which was composed at least two years before the remainder of the work and has remained, by itself, one of Chopin's most popular compositions. The Piano Sonata No. 2 carries allusions and reminiscences of music by Bach and by Beethoven; Beethoven's twelfth piano sonata also has a funeral march as its third movement. A typical performance of Chopin's second sonata lasts between 21 and 25 minutes, depending on whether the repetition of the first movement's exposition is observed. While the Piano Sonata No. 2 gained instant popularity with the public, critical reception was initially more doubtful. Robert Schumann, among other critics, argued that the work was structurally inferior and that Chopin \\"could not quite handle sonata form\\", a criticism that did not withstand time. The work has been recorded by numerous pianists and is regularly programmed in concerts and piano competitions. The Marche fun√®bre exists in countless arrangements and is performed at funerals all over the world (including Chopin's own funeral), having become an archetypal evocation of death.  Historical background  The Piano Sonata No. 2 was written during a time where the sonata lost its overpowering dominance. While the sonatas of Beethoven and Mozart comprised a considerable portion of their compositional output, this is not true of the next generation of composers: Franz Liszt only wrote two sonatas among his dozens of instrumental compositions, Robert Schumann seven (eight if including the Fantasie in C, Op. 17), and Felix Mendelssohn thirteen. Besides the Piano Sonata No. 2, Chopin wrote only three other sonatas: a piano sonata in C minor (Op. posth. 4), written at the age of eighteen; the Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor (Op. 58); and the Sonata for Piano and Cello in G minor (Op. 65).Leikin (1994), p. 176 The compositional origins of the Piano Sonata No. 2, the first mature piano sonata Chopin wrote,Leikin (1994), p. 177 are centred on its third movement (Marche fun√®bre), a funeral march which many scholars indicate was written in 1837.Petty (1999), p. 284 However, Jeffrey Kallberg believes that such indications are because of an autograph manuscript of eight bars of music in D-flat major marked Lento cantabile, apparently written as a gift to an unnamed recipient. The manuscript, which is dated 28 November 1837, would later become part of the trio of the Marche fun√®bre. However, Kallberg suggests this manuscript may have been intended as the beginning of an earlier attempt of a different slow movement instead of being part of the Marche fun√®bre, writing that \\"it would have been unusual for Chopin to make a gift of a manuscript that, if it did not contain an entire piece, did not at least quote the beginning of it\\", as almost all of his other presentation manuscripts did. He also suggests that a four-hand arrangement by Julian Fontana of the Marche fun√®bre may be connected with an abandoned piano sonata for four hands that Chopin wrote in 1835, originally to be published as his op. 28 (which was instead appropriated to the 24 Preludes, Op. 28), therefore raising the possibility that the movement may actually date from 1835 instead of the generally accepted 1837.Kallberg (2001), pp. 4-8 Some time after writing the Marche fun√®bre, Chopin composed the other movements, completing the entire sonata by 1839. In a letter on 8 August 1839, addressed to Fontana, Chopin wrote: Haslinger's unauthorised dissemination of Chopin's early C minor sonata (he had gone as far as engraving the work and allowing it to circulate, against the composer's wishes) may have increased the pressure Chopin had to publish a piano sonata, which may explain why Chopin added the other movements to the Marche fun√®bre to produce a sonata. The work was finished in the summer of 1839 in Nohant (near Ch√¢teauroux), in France, and published in May 1840 in London, Leipzig, and Paris. The work was not furnished with a dedication.  Analysis  The sonata comprises four movements: = I. Grave ‚Äì Doppio movimento = 5‚Äì7 minutes Breitkopf & H√§rtel edition edited by Johannes Brahms (1878). This edition lacks a backwards repeat sign at the Doppio movimento and therefore indicates that the repetition of the exposition should start at the Grave. The first movement is in a modified sonata form in B minor and time. It opens with a four-bar introduction in the relative major, D majorLeikin (2001), p. 570 marked Grave, followed by a tempo change to Doppio movimento, a key change to the tonic key, and the introduction of an agitatedJonson (1905), p. 124 bass accompanimental figure; four bars later, the main theme enters. The main theme, marked agitato, is followed by a second theme, in D major, which is marked piano and sostenuto. In the beginning of the development, all of the themes introduced in the exposition appear. Later in the development, a seemingly new tune, which is actually an inversion of part of the second theme, is introduced. In the climax of the development, Chopin combines three elements at once: the motifs from the Grave introduction and the main theme in the bass and treble respectively, with crotchet triplets in the middle. In the recapitulation, the principal section containing the main theme does not return, possibly inspired by the older binary sonata form typical of Domenico Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas;Leikin (1994), p. 187 instead, only the lyrical second theme returns in the tonic's parallel major of B. The movement is closed with a brilliant 12-bar coda, marked stretto and ending in three B-flat major chords marked fff (fortississimo).  Repeat of the exposition  When the sonata was published in 1840 in the usual three cities of Paris, Leipzig, and London,Rosen (1995), p. 279 the London and Paris editions indicated the repeat of the exposition as starting at the very beginning of the movement (at the Grave section). However, the Leipzig edition designed the repeat as beginning at the Doppio movimento section. Although the critical edition published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel (that was edited, among others, by Franz Liszt, Carl Reinecke, and Johannes Brahms) indicate the repeat similarly to the London and Paris first editions, almost all 20th century editions are similar to the Leipzig edition in this regard. Charles Rosen argues that the repeat of the exposition in the manner perpetrated by the Leipzig edition is a serious error, saying it is \\"musically impossible\\" as it interrupts the D-flat major cadence (which ends the exposition) with the B-flat minor accompanimental figure.Rosen (1995), p. 280 However, Leikin advocates for excluding the Grave from the repeat of the exposition, citing in part that Karol Mikuli's 1880 complete edition of Chopin contained a repeat sign after the Grave in the first movement of the Piano Sonata No. 2. Mikuli was a student of Chopin from 1844‚Äì1848 and also observed lessons Chopin gave to other students ‚Äì including those where this sonata was taught ‚Äì and took extensive notes.Leikin (2001), p. 581 Most commercial recordings exclude the Grave from the repetition of the exposition, including those of Vladimir Ashkenazy, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini, Martha Argerich, and Li Yundi; however, the recordings of Mitsuko Uchida and Yulianna Avdeeva, among others, begin the repetition from the Grave. Other recordings, including those of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Evgeny Kissin, and Garrick Ohlsson, exclude the repetition altogether. = II. Scherzo = 6‚Äì7 minutes Opening of the Scherzo The second movement is a scherzo in E minor and time with no tempo indication. Anatole Leikin suggests that the absence of the tempo indication can be explained by the close similarities of this movement and the closing section of the first movement, including the prevalence of repeated octaves and chords in both movements, and the identical cadential phrases. Therefore, the absence of a tempo indication may suggest that there is no new tempo, but instead a mere change of notation (from triplets to triple metre).Leikin (1994), p. 187-188 The movement is in the conventional scherzo-trio-scherzo formLeikin (1994), p. 189 with the trio in G major. The scherzo's explosive rhythmic and dynamic power, as well as its furious insistence on repeated chords and octaves, places it in the tradition of the scherzo movements of Beethoven. However, unlike Beethoven, whose scherzos are transformed minuets, this scherzo has many defining rhythmic characteristics that make it a transformed mazurka instead. The trio, marked Pi√π lento, has a songlike quality to it with its simple, sensuous melody.Huneker (1900), p. 297 Following the return of the scherzo is a coda that is a condensed reprise of the trioLeikin (1994), p. 190 and therefore ends the work in the relative major; other works of Chopin that also end in the relative major include the Scherzo No. 2 in B minor (Op. 31) and the Fantaisie in F minor (Op. 49). = III. Marche fun√®bre: Lento = 8‚Äì9 minutes Opening of the Marche fun√®bre The third movement, titled Marche fun√®bre, is a \\"stark juxtaposition of funeral march and pastoral trio\\".Boczkowska (2012), p. 217 The movement is in B minor and time with the trio in the relative major of D. The tempo designation, Lento, was not added until after the sonata's publication in 1840. The movement opens with a melody consisting of just a repeated B for almost three measures accompanied by alternating B (without the third) and G major chords that ring like a funereal bell. This melodic device was also used as the backbone for the main theme of the preceding Scherzo movement and part of the coda of the opening movement. The melody following the repeated B, is, as Alan Walker notes, \\"a strict retrogade\\" of the first movement's main theme. The trio of the movement, which is in the tonic's relative major, consists of a serene melodyJonson (1905), p. 125 accompanied by quavers in the left hand. The Marche fun√®bre alone has remained one of Chopin's most popular compositionsHuneker (1895). p. xiii and has become an archetypal evocation of death. It has been widely arranged for other instrumentations, most notably for orchestra.See Oleksiak (2005)See Kramer (2001) The first known orchestral arrangement of the movement was made by Napol√©on Henri Reber and was played at the graveside during Chopin's own burial on 30 October 1849 at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.Fryderyk Chopin ‚Äì A Chronological Biography . Retrieved 21 May 2007Kramer (2001), p. 97 The English conductor Henry Wood made two orchestrations of the Marche fun√®bre, the first of which was played at The Proms on four occasions between 1895 and 1904.BBC Proms Archives.

Retrieved 21 October 2014 In 1933, Sir Edward Elgar transcribed the Marche fun√®bre for full orchestra; its first performance was at his own memorial concert the next year. It was also transcribed for large orchestra by the conductor Leopold Stokowski; this version was recorded for the first time by Matthias Bamert. Although the movement was originally published as Marche fun√®bre, Chopin changed its title to simply Marche in his corrections of the first Paris edition.Ekier (2013), p. 79Kallberg (2001), p. 12 In addition, whenever Chopin wrote about this movement in his letters, he referred to it as a \\"march\\" instead of a \\"funeral march\\". Kallberg believes Chopin's removal of the adjective fun√®bre was possibly motivated by his contempt for descriptive labels of his music.Kallberg (2001), p. 14 After his London publisher Wessel & Stapleton added unauthorised titles to Chopin‚Äô works, including The Infernal Banquet to his first scherzo in B minor (Op. 20), the composer, in a letter to Fontana, wrote: In 1826, a decade before he wrote this movement, Chopin had composed another Marche fun√®bre in C minor, which was published posthumously as Op. 72 No. 2. = IV. Finale: Presto = 1‚Äì2 minutes Opening of the finale The short finale, marked Presto and in time, is a perpetuum mobile in \\"relatively simple\\" binary form consisting of parallel octaves played sotto voce e legato (similarly to the Prelude in E minor, Op. 28 No. 14) and not a single rest or chord until the final bars with a sudden fortissimo B bass octave and a B minor chord ending the whole piece. In this movement, \\"a complicated chromaticism is worked out in implied three- and four-part harmony entirely by means of one doubled monophonic line\\";Rosen (1995), p. 298 very similarly, the 5 measures that begin Bach's Fugue in A minor (BWV 543) imply a four-part harmony through a single monophonic line.Rosen (1995), p. 290 Garrick Ohlsson remarked that the movement is \\"extraordinary, because he‚Äôs written the weirdest movement he's ever written in his whole life, something which truly looks to the 20th century and post- romanticism and atonality\\". Additionally, Leikin describes the finale as \\"probably the most enigmatic piece Chopin ever wrote\\",Leikin (1994), p. 191 and Anton Rubinstein is said to have remarked that the fourth movement is the \\"wind howling around the gravestones\\". Chopin, who wrote pedal indications very frequently, did not write any in the Finale except for the very last bar. Although Moritz Rosenthal (a pupil of Liszt and Mikuli) claimed that the movement should not be played with any pedal except where indicated in the last measure, Rosen believed that the \\"effect of wind over the graves\\", as Anton Rubinstein described this movement, \\"is generally achieved with a heavy wash of pedal\\". = Allusions = The Piano Sonata No. 2 draws an allusion to the Prelude from Bach's Cello Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012. A frequently repeated motif of Bach's Prelude is noticeably similar to the main theme of the first movement of Chopin's sonata; in addition, similarly to the Finale of Chopin's sonata, the Prelude is a perpetuum mobile with four groups of quaver triplets per bar.Leikin (1994), pp. 191-192 In addition, in the Finale, Chopin borrowed from Bach the craft of achieving polyphony through a monophonic line by the means of arpeggiated figures: in some respects, he even went further than Bach in this regard.Rosen (1995), p. 301 In addition, the plan of Chopin's sonata directly follows that of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major, Op. 26, which also is in four movements and features a Marcia fun√®bre slow movement: like Chopin's sonata, the slow funeral march movement follows the fast scherzo second movement. Chopin is usually regarded as the Romantic era composer least influenced by Beethoven;Petty (1999), p. 281 however, Beethoven's Op. 26 was reportedly his favourite Beethoven sonata, and he played and taught it more than any other Beethoven sonata.  Reception and legacy  Although the Piano Sonata No. 2 was quick to gain popularity among the public, it initially confused the critics, who found it lacked cohesion and unity, and remarked that he could not quite handle sonata form. Most of the critical reviews written in the century following the work's publication were negative, although critics were still very complimentary about certain aspects of the sonata.Oshry (1999), pp. 19-20 The sonata, along with Chopin's two other mature sonatas, was performed very sporadically in Poland and other countries in Europe prior to 1900; however, the Marche fun√®bre by itself was performed often, both for piano and in transcriptions. It was not until the turn of the century that the sonatas were performed more often.Chechli≈Ñska (1994), p. 230 Recent commentaries suggest that the notions that the work suffers from structural inferiority and that Chopin could not handle sonata form are slowly fading away, and it is now considered one of the greatest piano sonatas of the literature. The sonata now continues to regularly appear on concert programs and is frequently performed in classical music competitions, especially the Chopin International Piano Competition. The first major criticism, by Robert Schumann, appeared in 1841. Schumann was critical of the work. He described the sonata as \\"four of [his] maddest children under the same roof\\" and found the title \\"Sonata\\" capricious and slightly presumptuous.Petty (1999), p. 285 He also remarked that the Marche fun√®bre \\"has something repulsive\\" about it, and that \\"an adagio in its place, perhaps in D-flat, would have had a far more beautiful effect\\".Oshry (1999), p. 89 In addition, the finale caused a stir among Schumann and other musicians. Schumann said that the movement \\"seems more like a mockery than any [sort of] music\\", and when Felix Mendelssohn was asked for an opinion of it, he commented, \\"Oh, I abhor it\\". James Huneker remarked that the four movements of the sonata \\"have no common life\\", and that the sonata \\"is not more a sonata than it is a sequence of ballades and scherzi.\\" Despite these remarks, he called the last two movements ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù and wrote that the finale has ‚Äúno parallel in piano music‚Äù.Huneker (1900), pp. 295-296 Similarly, James Cuthbert Hadden wrote that \\"the four movements, regarded separately, are admirable, but taken together they have little thematic or other affinity,\\" and also concurred with Schumann's description of the sonata as \\"four of his maddest children\\" bound together.Hadden (1903), Henry Bidou considered the work \\"not very coherent\\", and remarked that \\"Schumann has pointed out the defect in its composition\\".Oshry (1999), p. 26 Despite the negative reaction to the work, the reception of the Marche fun√®bre itself was generally positive, and according to Hadden, writing in 1903, the work had been \\"popularised to death\\". Franz Liszt, a friend of Chopin's, remarked that the Marche fun√®bre is \\"of such penetrating sweetness that we can scarcely deem it of this earth\\",Liszt (1863), p. 26 and Charles Willeby wrote that it is by far \\"the most beautiful and consistent movement\\" of the work.Willeby (1892), p. 225 Despite criticising the sonata as a whole, Hadden conveyed the opinion that the Marche fun√®bre \\"is really the finest movement in the Sonata\\". The Marche fun√®bre alone continues to be one of Chopin's most enduringly popular compositions, and is performed at funerals around the world. In addition to Chopin's own funeral, it was also performed at the state funerals of John F. Kennedy,John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Retrieved 1 April 2016 Sir Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and those of Soviet and Communist leaders, including Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Josef Broz Tito. The movement was also played at the state funeral of Polish president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, and Egyptian presidents Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak. The sonata, mainly the Marche fun√®bre, played an influence in a variety of both classical and non-classical compositions written after it. The development of the first movement contains a complex network of leitmotifs that Richard Wagner would similarly bring to fruition in his work Der Ring des Nibelungen (popularly known as the Ring Cycle).Rosen (1995), pp. 467-469 The second movement of Erik Satie's Embryons dess√©ch√©s, entitled \\"of an Edriophthalma\\", uses a variation on the Marche fun√®bre's second theme. Satie labels it \\"Citation de la c√©l√®bre mazurka de SCHUBERT\\" (\\"quotation from the celebrated mazurka of Schubert\\"), but no such piece exists.Potter (2016), pp. 109-111 In addition, the Marche fun√®bre is sampled in a number of jazz compositions, including Duke Ellington's \\"Black and Tan Fantasy\\",Metzer (1997), pp. 139-140 and the Canadian electronic dance music musician deadmau5 used the theme from the Marche fun√®bre in his song \\"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\\".McCutcheon (2008), p. 168 Professional wrestler The Undertaker quotes the opening of the March in his entrance theme, as part of his macabre gimmick. This sonata also influenced Sergei Rachmaninoff in his Piano Sonata No. 2 (Op. 36), also in B minor. While explaining to his friends why he decided on a new 1931 version, Rachmaninoff said: \\"I look at my early works and see how much there is that is superfluous. Even in this sonata so many voices are moving simultaneously, and it is too long. Chopin's Sonata lasts nineteen minutes, and all has been said\\".Alfred and Katherine Swan, Rachmaninoff. Personal Reminiscences (Part I), in: The Musical Quarterly, January 1944, p. 8  Available editions and recordings  Several highly acclaimed editions are available of the Piano Sonata No. 2, most notably the editions of G. Henle Verlag, the edition edited by Ignacy Jan Paderewski, and the Chopin National Edition edited by Jan Ekier.Ekier (2013) The work has been widely performed and recorded. Two of the earliest commercial recordings of the work were made by Percy Grainger and Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1928 and 1930 respectively. Commercial recordings have also been made by such pianists as Alfred Cortot, Daniel Barenboim, Alexander Brailowsky, Samson Fran√ßois, Emil Gilels, Vladimir Horowitz, William Kapell, Wilhelm Kempff, Evgeny Kissin, George Li, Murray Perahia, Ivo Pogoreliƒá, Antonio Pompa-Baldi, Arthur Rubinstein, Mitsuko Uchida, and Chopin International Piano Competition winners Martha Argerich, Yulianna Avdeeva, Seong-Jin Cho, Maurizio Pollini, Adam Harasiewicz, Li Yundi, and Garrick Ohlsson.

It was started in 1988 by Steve Hindy and Tom Potter. History Hindy learned to brew beer during a six-year stay in various Middle Eastern nations such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Upon his return to his home in Brooklyn in 1984, he and Potter, his downstairs neighbor from Park Slope, quit their jobs and founded the brewery. The pair hired graphic designer Milton Glaser, best known as the creator of the logo for the I Love New York campaign, to create the company logo and identity. Glaser received a share in the company in return. Originally all their beer was brewed by contract by Matt Brewing Company, and the pair started their own distribution company and personally transported and marketed their beer to bars and retailers around New York City. In 1996, they acquired a former matzo factory in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and converted it into a functional brewery. Although the brewery looked to expand its brewing capacity in the City, originally most of the production, including all Brooklyn Lager and all bottled products, were brewed by contract in the upstate New York city of Utica, due to the limited ability to meet demand at the Williamsburg brewery, its lack of a bottling line, and the cost benefits of contract brewing. The company later sought to expand its facilities in Brooklyn, but had difficulty finding a suitable site within the borough. However, an economic recession allowed them to remain in Williamsburg and undertake a $6.5 million expansion of the brewery in 2009. Since 1994, Garrett Oliver has been the Brooklyn Brewery brewmaster. He had first been appointed brewmaster at the Manhattan Brewing Company of New York in 1993 where he began brewing professionally as an apprentice in 1989. In 2003 he published the book \\"The Brewmaster's Table: Discovering the Pleasures of Real Beer with Real Food\\". Garrett has also been a judge at the Great American Beer Festival for eleven years. In 2016, they announced that they were looking to relocate their specialty brewing operation in Williamsburg after their landlord, Yoel Goldman, put the building up for sale as they would not be able to renew their lease for a reasonable price given escalating real estate prices.The Real Deal: \\"Brooklyn Brewery looking for 60K sf for brewing operation - The well- known beer brand is checking out Navy Yard, Industry City for space\\" February 23, 2016 They also plan to relocate their main brewery in Utica, New York to a $70 million, 200,000-square-foot facility on Staten Island. Japanese corporation Kirin acquired a 24.5% stake in the brewery in October 2016.  Distribution  Since December 30, 2016, the Carlsberg Group has an agreement with Brooklyn Brewery to distribute its beers in Europe, the UK, and Hong Kong. Carlsberg has opened a craft brewery in Lithuania to produce Brooklyn Lager under license. Brooklyn Brewery has acquired London Fields Brewery in a joint venture with Carlsberg. Marketing The brewery has taken a less conventional approach to marketing and advertising, relying more on word-of- mouth, brand visibility at bars as well as donations to, and sponsorship of, nonprofits. Organizations sponsored by the brewery include Eat Drink Local Week, Desertfest, the Culinary Institute of America's Hyde Park campus, New York Harbor Restoration, the Brooklyn Museum and The New York Poetry Festival. Beer School In 2005 Hindy and Potter published Beer School: Bottling Success At The Brooklyn Brewery through John Wiley & Sons. The book is both a guide to entrepreneurship and beer brewing as well as a memoir of the authors' time together while building the Brooklyn Brewery. Beer School goes over topics such as building teams as well as guerrilla marketing and publicity, with each chapter being written around a theme in the brewery's history. The book is told through the perspectives of both Hindy and Potter, and received mostly positive reviews from critics.

It is located on Bertrab Nunatak on the Conf√≠n Coast, Coats Land. it is Argentina's southernmost permanent base, the world's third furthest south permanent base, and the world's southernmost base built on solid rock, which makes it particularly suited for geological research. Belgrano II is one of 13 research stations in Antarctica operated by Argentina. History In 1955, then Brigade General Hern√°n Pujato founded the first Belgrano Base (Belgrano I), which remained for years as Argentina's southernmost settlement. After a continuous activity for 25 years, Belgrano I was closed due to the fast deterioration of the ice barrier it was sitting on; new, often hidden cracks and crevices endangered the on-duty personnel and material. In order to continue the scientific programs and keep Argentina presence in the area, and after careful studies on alternative locations done by the Argentine Army, it was decided to lay the new facilities on solid land. Amid the vast expanse of ice that covers the region, only two small masses of granite emerge: the Moltke and Bertrab nunataks, both first sighted and named by Filchner's expedition in 1912. Belgrano II was founded on 5 February 1979 over the latter, a hectare of permanently ice-free land. Also and despite being farther south and higher than Belgrano I, the climate was significantly milder. The unloading of the materials‚Äîequipment, tools and instruments, food and fuel‚Äîwas conducted from the icebreaker ARA General San Mart√≠n. The new housing facilities were a vast improvement over the previous base ones: since 1955, the men who wintered in the old Belgrano I Base were living inside tunnels dug in the ice, ice that was always moving slowly towards the sea and, as finally happened, would become a tabular iceberg drifting through the Southern Ocean. In its area of influence two Argentine-built refuges existed since long before: the Sargento Ayudante Cisterna y el Aviso ARA Comandante Zapiola shelters had been set up in January 1976. In addition to new instruments brought from the mainland, Belgrano II received all the scientific equipment transferred from Belgrano I. The LABEL laboratory (LAboratory BELgrano) was rebuilt demanding considerable effort. A new facility, the Jos√© Luis Sersic polar astronomical observatory and a satellite dish antenna for data transmission were also set up. On the morning of 10 September 2005 the main house was completely destroyed as a result of a fire caused by a heater malfunction. Personnel had to be distributed to other buildings and new food and clothes had to be brought from the mainland and airdropped as the fire had destroyed all the wintering elements. The construction of emergency facilities to solve the housing problem started in early 2006, This new building was planned in two stages with the first one (bathrooms, kitchen and bedrooms) being finished in 2006‚Äì07 and the second one (living room), in 2007‚Äì08. During the 2008‚Äì09 campaign the construction of a new main house began. It was completed during the 2009‚Äì10 campaign and was inaugurated on 25 May 2010. The new house has a covered area of about with more comfort and space for recreation: it is located on what was once the former home destroyed by fire. During the repairs of the Argentine Navy icebreaker ARA Almirante Ir√≠zar which is normally used to supply the base, the Argentine Air Force took over the task with airdrops by KC-130 Hercules aircraft in a non-stop flight from Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego. =Historic site= A cross was erected in 1955 some north-east of Belgrano I and subsequently moved to Belgrano II in 1979. This has been designated a Historic Site or Monument, following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Description Belgrano II is about from the South Pole and from Ushuaia, the nearest port city. it is Argentina's southernmost permanent base, and the third further south permanent base in the planet. It is also the world's southmost base built on solid rock, which gives it unique advantages for seismological and geological research. As a result of its latitude, the summer day and winter night are four months long and the night sky often displays the aurora australis. Belgrano II is composed of a dozen buildings stationed on the nunatak rock, spanning a total area of . Structures are mostly of composite panels covered by metal or fiberglass filled with polyurethane foam to provide adequate thermal insulation to resist low temperatures. Some of the facilities at the base are: main and personnel houses; emergency house/infirmary; airstrip; heliport; chapel; museum; radio station; meteorological station; power plant; vehicle fleet (several Tucker Sno-Cats and Yamaha VK-541 ski- doos); atmospheric research station; mechanical, carpentry and electricity workshop; general equipment and spare parts warehouses; and foodstuff deposits (also called GUM). The all-year capable airstrip is located on a glacier southwest of the base. The one-bed infirmary is , attended by a doctor and a nurse. It has x-ray and odontological facilities. Dug in the nearby ice, Belgrano II's Catholic chapel is the world's southernmost Christian church‚Äîin fact, it's the southernmost worship place of any religion. The general tasks of the base personnel are primarily of scientific research, survey and exploration, also providing support for foreign scientific efforts. Other common duties are shelter maintenance, search and rescue, medical, communications and weather forecast support to expeditions, bases, ships and aircraft, both local and foreign. =Scientific activity= The following research programs are run at LABEL: * Meteorology forecast * Atmospheric ozone research with high altitude probes and a Brewer spectrophotometer from the World Meteorological Organization, a joint program with Italy; and EVA IFAR spectrophotometer, a joint program with INTA in Spain * Astrolabel, through optical telescope, an agreement with the Astronomical Observatory of C√≥rdoba) * Solar radiation and energy resources study through the local satellite station transmitting data in real time; since February 1998 a geodetic GPS receiver and seismological recording station have been installed through a joint program with the Alfred Wegener Institute of Germany; * Seismography, operating the world's southernmost seismograph over firm rock * Analysis of Earth's magnetic field variations * Ionospheric and aurorae sounding research in cooperation with Italy * Riometry, cosmic noise analysis * Bird monitoring and nesting patterns * Geodesy, through GPS and a Doris beacon Although maintained by the Argentine Armed Forces, as all Argentine bases on Antarctica, it is operated by the civilian agency Argentine Antarctic Institute. , the base has a 19 men crew two of whom are Air Force meteorologists, three are Argentine National Antarctic Directorate civilian researchers and the rest is Argentine Army personnel in charge of operating the base. =Climate= The Belgrano II base has a coastal-influenced ice cap climate. The area is a passage of weather fronts directed towards the north: although they do not precipitate, they do produce strong winds exceeding which radically increase the chill factor. Mean monthly temperatures range from in July, the coldest month to in January, the warmest month. During summer, the average high is while the average low is . In winter, the average high and low are and respectively. Temperature extremes range between to . During the polar night, a lot of aurorae can be observed. Snowfall occurs throughout the year; on average, there are 143 days with snow. January to April are the snowiest periods of the year with each month receiving 13 to 14 days with snow.

He is also known as Werner of Urslingen. Biography Werner was born at Irslingen, in Irslingen Swabia, a member of the family of the dukes of Urslingen, and probably a descendant of the dukes of Spoleto. In 1338 he fought for the Republic of Venice against Mastino II della Scala of Verona. After the end of that conflict he entered the Compagnia di San Giorgio, financed by the Veronese and led by Lodrisio Visconti, and took part in the battle of Parabiago. In 1342 Werner joined the service of the Republic of Pisa in its war against Florence, whose troops were led by Malatesta III Malatesta. After that war he collected a troop of adventurers under the name Great Company, with which he plundered rural Tuscany, Umbria, and the Romagna. He supported Francesco Ordelaffi against the Papal States, and was bribed by his enemy, Malatestino Malatesta of Rimini, to help him in his feud with Ferrantino Malatesta. In 1343 Werner was hired by Taddeo Pepoli of Bologna for a very large sum, to fight against Obizzo III d'Este of Modena; but he switched to the Este side and went on to ravage several cities, including Correggio. His company was subsequently expelled from the Ferrara area, and Werner of Urslingen returned to Germany with some of his men. In 1347 he returned to the Italian peninsula and entered the service of Louis I the Great, king of Hungary and Poland, whom he assisted to obtain possession of Naples. Werner of Urslingen's troops defeated Louis, Prince of Taranto (Joan's husband) near Naples, and King Louis was able to enter the city; the following year, however, Werner was accused of collaboration with Joan, and arrested. After having been freed, he entered the service of the Caetani of Fondi with 3,000 men, to attack the Orsini at Supino. In 1348 he sacked and destroyed Anagni: this spurred Perugia and other communes to muster an army against him, and Werner, whose troops had also been struck by the plague, was forced to retreat. He then joined the service of the Papal States, for which he conquered several territories, and then that of Joan of Naples, whom he helped to return in Naples. In 1349, after a period of fighting in Apulia (of which he was named viceroy), he was ambushed by the Hungarian Voivoda of Transylvania, Stephen Lackfi, and defeated. Werner then mustered an army of 3,000 Hungarian, German, and Neapolitan knights and 2,000 Lombard foot soldiers to counter-attack Stephen, defeating him before Naples. In 1350 he allied with Giovanni di Vico to ravage the Papal fiefs in northern Latium. In the same period he signed an agreement with Louis of Taranto to cede him Capua, Aversa, and other strongholds in the Kingdom of Naples. Werner subsequently fought for the lords of Forl√¨ and Faenza against the papal legate, and, hired by Giacomo Pepoli of Bologna, helped him to regain his city, but not before sacking it. After Bologna was sold back to the Visconti, Werner besieged it, but was defeated by Galeazzo II Visconti's army. In 1351 his company was unable to find anyone to pay it, until he was hired by Mastino II della Scala and then by the Visconti. Later, he returned to Swabia, where he died in 1354. After his death, the leadership of the Grand Company went to Fra' Moriale. He is said to have worn a breastplate with the inscription \\"The enemy of God, of pity and of mercy.\\"Meyer, G.

It is often indented into the sidewalk or other pedestrian area. A bus bay is, in a way, the opposite of a bus bulb. With a bus bulb, the point is to save the bus the time needed to merge out of and back into moving traffic, at the cost of temporarily blocking that traffic while making a stop. With a bus bay, the goal is to not block traffic while the bus is stopped, but at the cost of the time necessary to merge back into flowing traffic. Bus bays, therefore, will generally produce longer dwell times than bus bulbs. The dwell time can be reduced by traffic legislation. E. g. in the Czech Republic, the drivers in the running traffic lane are obliged to enable to the bus to leave the bus stop, but this obligation applies only in built up area. The Czech technical standards from 1970s and 1990s (ƒåSN 73 6425) preferred to build bus bays at all classes of roads, the new version ƒåSN 73 6425-1 from 2007 prefers bus stops in the running lane within traffic calming concept.

Autograph by Hannes Hegen Hannes Hegen (real name Johannes Eduard Hegenbarth; 16 May 1925 - 8 November 2014) was a German illustrator and caricaturist and is most famous for creating the East German comic book Mosaik and its original protagonists, the Digedags. Hegen was born in B√∂hmisch Kamnitz, now ƒåesk√° Kamenice. He studied at the University of Applied Arts Vienna and at the Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig. After his studies, he worked in Berlin, illustrating several magazines. His own creation Mosaik was first published in December 1955. Hegen was solely responsible for only the first issues of the book. Later a team of artists and writers worked on the book, but only Hegen was credited on the cover. 223 issues were produced. Hegen worked on Mosaik until 1975, when he had a disagreement with the publisher and quit working, taking the rights to the Digedags characters with him. The Mosaik team continued without him and created new characters to appear in Mosaik. Hegen died in Berlin, aged 89, still working on reprint and book editions for the original Mosaik comics. In 2008 Hannes Hegen received the Max & Moritz Prize, the most important German prize for comic artists from the International Comic Salon Erlangen.

History  A young designer, Jeff Childress, created an autonomous radio base-station controller, known as the GETC (General Electric Trunking Card). The GETC was a general-purpose controller with input/output optimized for radio system applications. Childress and the team demonstrated that a smart controller could be adapted to a variety of applications, but his interest was really in fault tolerance. The competition dealt with fault tolerance by means of the \\"brute force and ignorance\\" approach, deploying double the hardware for their controllers, and interconnecting them with massive and problematic relay banks . The EDACS system architecture supported large communications footprints. By making the GETC's \\"trunk\\" among themselves, one GETC per channel, the system was designed to be inherently fault-tolerant. If one channel, or device, experienced problems, the others voted it off the network, and calls continued to be processed with the remaining resources . This provided substantial hardware reductions, and the required software efforts yielded a variety of unique features and options. This was not a new concept in systems design; however, few other teams have embodied it cleanly into such wide distribution.  Current status  The EDACS system continues to be sold and supports a sizable portion of the market today for the public safety, public transit, and industrial two-way radio communications field . EDACS was developed in competition with Motorola's Smartnet trunking system. It claimed, and continues to hold, significant market share. GE teamed with Sweden's Ericsson, and the company became Ericsson GE. Later, GE exited the business. Ericsson eventually sold the Private Radio Systems (PRS) unit to Com-Net in 2000, resulting in Com-Net Ericsson. M/A-COM Inc., a holding of Tyco Electronics, acquired the business and technologies in May 2001, including many of the original team members, some of their children, and a few grandchildren who continue to manufacture and support the product family. EDACS has the largest customer base of any technology in M/A-COM's portfolio (i.e. EDACS, OpenSky, P25 and TETRA). Over 500 large-scale EDACS radio systems have been sold - with the State of Florida being the largest. Hundreds of thousands of radios have been sold to function on these EDACS systems . In April 2009 Harris Corporation (NYSE:HRS), an international communications and information technology company, acquired the Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems business (formerly known as M/A-COM).  Software  Software for system managers and radio monitors alike has been developed outside of the vendor. ETrunker is a modification to the Trunker code to work on the EDACS control channel. Users of the software can monitor and log complete system activity. See the Trunker Site for more info.  ProVoice  ProVoice is Tyco Electronics' (formerly M/A-COM, Ericsson and GE) implementation of IMBE digital modulation for radio communications. It is not APCO-25 compliant, but does use the same IMBE vocoder developed by Digital Voice Systems, Inc. (DVSI). The technical difference between ProVoice and the APCO Project-25 standard is how error correction and modulation is provided to transmit the data.

Cahn and starring Marla English, Tom Conway, and Mike Connors. It was released by American International Pictures as a double feature with The Undead. Plot A pair of treasure hunters, which includes the beautiful but ruthless Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English), discover gold in the voodoo idol of a tribe of the African jungle. Hoping to find more such treasures, they con the innocent Ted Bronson (Mike Connors) into acting as a jungle guide and leading them to the tribe that made the idol. Meanwhile, Dr. Roland Gerard (Tom Conway), a mad scientist who has exiled himself deep in the same jungle, is using a combination of native voodoo and his own biochemical discoveries in an attempt to create a superhuman being. He hopes that this being, possessing the best of man and beast, will be the mother of a new perfect and deathless race which he will control with a mixture of hypnosis and telepathy. He is accompanied by his wife, Susan (Mary Ellen Kaye), who has long since disavowed her husband but remains trapped by her husband and the natives. Dr. Gerard's initial attempts to create a female superbeing are a failure because the transformation is only temporary and the native girl used as the subject of the experiment lacks the killer instinct he deems necessary for survival. However, when he stumbles upon the party of treasure hunters, he decides that Marilyn will be a perfect subject for his experiment. He successfully turns her into an invulnerable monster, but her inherent selfishness and greed outweigh his mental control over her and she turns on him.

The original make-up design for the Voodoo Woman was deemed unsuitable at the last minute and the title monster is actually the She Creature costume hurriedly stripped of its tail, fins and pincer-like claws. What remained was the bulky Thing- style body, which was wrapped in a burlap sarong and topped with a modified skull mask and big blond wig. Cahn worked actively to conceal this fact, using quick cuts and keeping her mostly in shadows or behind foliage. The rumbling growl of a lion was also dubbed for added effect. Reception The film is widely regarded as one of the worst films in cinema ‚Äì yet in 1966, just nine years later, it was remade by Larry Buchanan into a TV film that is considered even worse, Curse of the Swamp Creature. On a more personal level, in his The Pit and the Pen column in Fangoria magazine producer Alex Gordon revealed that the movie nearly caused a break-up with his then-fiance Ruth Alexander. Proud of the finished production he took her to see it at its Burbank premiere only to have her hand back his engagement ring when it was over, telling him that he should be making prestigious high class art films and not trash like this. Luckily, his brother Richard was able to explain to her the differences between low budget and big budget film-making, and she and Alex were eventually married, with her later actually scripting several of his features.

It is located on Potter Cove, King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands. , Carlini is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina. History Potter Cove, in the southwestern region of the King George Island (known as Isla 25 de Mayo in Argentina) in the South Shetland archipelago was chosen around 1953 to host an Argentine naval station for amphibious aircraft support. The refuge was established on 21 November 1953, being temporarily called Refugio Potter and then Caleta Potter Naval Station. In the summer campaign of 1953‚Äì54 the shelter was inhabited by only three men. It was proposed to name the base after naval aviator Jose Isidro Jubany, killed on duty on 14 September 1948; the station was thus renamed as Teniente Jubany in the course of the 1954‚Äì55 campaign. In the summer campaign of 1957‚Äì1958 two groups of scientists working for the Argentine Antarctic Institute conducted geological survey work in the area, collecting petrographic and paleontological samples to study local geological upward movements. Dr. Otto Schneider was head of the first group and Osvaldo C. Schauer, chief of the second. In 1982 the naval station facilities were transferred to the Argentine Antarctic Institute and the station was upgraded to the status of base, being inaugurated as such on 12 February. In 1990 the Alfred Wegener Institute of marine research, Germany, began talks with the Argentine National Antarctic Institute, dealing with the installation of on- site laboratories and aquariums with modern equipment for scientific research. This new facility‚Äînamed Dallmann Laboratory‚Äîwas inaugurated on 20 January 1994, has an area of and was built in mainland Argentina, disassembled, carried by ship to Potter Cove, and reassembled at the base. In 1994 the LAJUB laboratory for greenhouse effect research was installed in collaboration with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IFA), Italy. On 5 March 2012, by decree 309/2012 of the Executive, the base was renamed to Base Carlini, after the late researcher Dr. Alejandro Ricardo Carlini, of distinguished trajectory in Antarctic scientific studies. On 8 December 2013 Metallica performed a concert at the base, under a small specially-built dome and without amplification due to environmental concerns. The show was streamed worldwide. Description Since its upgrade to base status in 1982, Carlini's facilities have been continuously improved; they include: main, emergency, technical staff and personnel houses; weather station; LAJUB Laboratory; Dallmann Laboratory; infirmary; radio station; power plant (both main and auxiliary, just for emergencies); garage and workhouse; freezing chamber; warehouse for supplies; incinerator and compactor for residues; installations for fuel pump, heat generation and fuel filtering and purification; various multiple use buildings; fuel tank array; antenna; heliport; geodetic GPS receiver station and seismography station. This adds to a maximum lodging capacity for 60 people. it has an average winter population of 20 people. The base is located next to a colony of more than 16,000 penguins and 650 sea lions. The usual route to reach the base includes a flight from Ushuaia to Marambio Base, and then sailing for a few days. Carlini enables scientists from different areas to develop advanced research projects in the disciplines of the natural sciences. These tasks increase during the more active summer campaigns. For example, there have been studies on human behavior and its biochemical correlations; ecological aspects of benthic, planktonic and coastal populations; censuses within pinniped colonies (mainly elephant seals and fur seals); physical chemistry and biology of lakes, ponds and other water bodies; tracing of ecotoxicological elements in the Antarctic ecosystem; continuous monitoring of long-term sea level in geology and geophysics operations; coastal ecology and microbiology; effect of UV radiation on marine phytoplankton and bacteria; etc. =Dallmann Laboratory= At the Dallmann Laboratory‚Äîa German-Argentine cooperation project‚Äîmultidisciplinary joint research programs are carried out in the fields of biology; coastal and terrestrial ecology; terrestrial wildlife (mostly elephants and seals); pollution effects on birds and fish populations; oceanography; coastal geology; etc. The lab has three modules for bedrooms, bathroom and living- dining room, two modules for laboratories and one for the engine room and dive locker. It also has four containers for laboratory and aquarium use donated by Germany. It is equipped with several scientific instruments and vehicles provided by Germany: lyophilizer, stereo microscopes, freezers, a small hyperbaric chamber for transport, scuba diving equipment, aquariums, a rigid hull boat and a K√§ssbohrer tracked vehicle. The Argentine Antarctic Institute, the Netherlands Geosciences Foundation and the Alfred Wegener Institute signed an agreement to provide a biological purification plant ceded by the Netherlands. It consists of a scrubber tank, a treatment and sludge drying plant, as well as facilities and equipment for process control and monitoring, and a set of basic spare parts and fuel reserves. 1994 dallmann01 hg.jpg 1994 dallmann08 hg.jpg 1994 dallmann06 hg.jpg =LACAR Laboratories= The LACAR (Laboratorio Ant√°rtico Multidisciplinario Carlini) laboratories -former 'LAJUB' when the station designation was Jubany- are formed by two facilities / buildings: LACAR-Cabildo and LACAR-Catedral.

In short, computational epistemology is to induction what recursion theory is to deduction. Themes Some of the themes of computational epistemology include: *the essential likeness of induction and deduction (as illustrated by systematic analogies between their respective complexity classes) *the treatment of discovery, prediction and assessment methods as effective procedures (algorithms) as originates in algorithmic learning theory. *the characterization of inductive inference problems as consisting of: #a set of relevant possibilities (possible worlds), each of which specifies some potentially infinite sequence of inputs to the scientist's method, #a question whose potential answers partition the relevant possibilities (in the set theoretic sense), #a convergent success criterion and #a set of admissible methods *the notion of logical reliability for inductive problems Quotations Computational epistemology definition: :\\"Computational epistemology is an interdisciplinary field that concerns itself with the relationships and constraints between reality, measure, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom\\" (Rugai, 2013) On making inductive problems easier to solve: :\\"Eliminating relevant possibilities, weakening the convergence criterion, coarsening the question, or augmenting the collection of potential strategies all tend to make a problem easier to solve\\" (Kelly, 2000a) On the divergence of computational epistemology from Bayesian confirmation theory and the like: :\\"Whenever you are inclined to explain a feature of science in terms of probability and confirmation, take a moment to see how the issue would look in terms of complexity and success\\"(Kelly, 2000a) Computational epistemology in a nutshell: ::Formal learning theory is very simple in outline. An inductive problem specifies a range of epistemically possible worlds over which to succeed and determines what sort of output would be correct, where correctness may embody both content and truth (or some analogous virtue like empirical adequacy). Each possible world produces an input stream which the inductive method processes sequentially, generating its own output stream, which may terminate (ending with a mark indicating this fact) or go on forever. A notion of success specifies how the method should converge to a correct output in each possible world. A method solves the problem (in a given sense) just in case the method succeeds (in the appropriate sense) in each of the possible worlds specified by the problem. We say that such a method is reliable since it succeeds over all the epistemically possible worlds. Of two non-solutions, one is as reliable as the other just in case it succeeds in all the worlds the other one succeeds in. That's all there is to it!

He was one of the best representatives of Islamic culture during the last period of the Abbasid Caliphate. His work was the subject of extensive 19th-century Austrian scholarship. Biography The biographical details of al-Hamdani's life are scant, despite his extensive scientific work. He was held in high repute as a grammarian, wrote much poetry, compiled astronomical tables and is said to have devoted most of his life to the study of the ancient history and geography of Arabia. Before he was born his family had lived in al-Marashi (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ÿßÿ¥Ÿä). Then they moved to Sana'a (ÿµŸÜÿπÿßÿ°), where al- Hamdani was born in the year 893. His father had been a traveller and had visited Kufa, Baghdad, Basra, Oman and Egypt. At around the age of seven, al- Marashi started to talk about his desire to travel. Somewhat later he left for Mecca, where he remained and studied for more than six years, after which he departed for Sa'dah (ÿµÿπÿØÿ©). There he gathered information on Khawlaan (ÿÆŸàŸÑÿßŸÜ). Later, he went back to Sanaa and became interested in the land that was Himyar (ÿ≠ŸÖŸíŸäÿ±), but was imprisoned for two years due to his political views. After his release from prison, he went to Raydah (ÿ±ŸäÿØÿ©) to live under the protection of his own tribe. He compiled most of his books while there and stayed on until his death in 945. Writings His Geography of the Arabian Peninsula (Sifat Jazirat ul-Arab) is by far the most important work on the subject. The manuscript was used by Austrian orientalist, Aloys Sprenger in his Post- und Reiserouten des Orients (Leipzig, 1864) and further in his Alte Geographie Arabiens (Bern, 1875), and was edited by D.H. M√ºller (Leiden, 1884; cf. Sprenger's criticism in Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. 45, pp. 361‚Äì394). His work has been the subject of extensive research and publications by the Austrian Arabist, Eduard Glaser, a specialist on ancient Arabia. The other great work of al-HamdƒÅnƒ´ is his ten volume, Iklil (the Diadem), concerning the genealogies of the Himyarites and the wars waged by their kings. Volume 8, on the citadels and castles of southern Arabia, has been translated into German, edited and annotated by D.H.M√ºller as Die Burgen und Schl√∂sser Sudarabiens (Vienna, 1881). Other works said to have been written by al-Hamdani are listed in G. L. Fl√ºgel's Die grammatischen Schulen der Araber (Leipzig, 1862), pp. 220‚Äì221. =List of works= al-Jawharatayn al- ªatƒ´qatayn - A book describing metals known at that time, including their physical and chemical properties as well as treatment and processing (such as gold, silver, and steel).

He was an important figure in the struggle for religious liberty in the United States. Leland also later opposed the rise of missionary societies among Baptists.Biography Of Elder John Leland Early life Leland was born on May 14, 1754, in Grafton, Massachusetts. His parents were Congregationalists He married Sarah Devine and they had nine children, Betsy, Hannah, Polly, John, Sally, Lucy, Fanny, Nancy, & Lemuel. Public life and views Leland's letter to James Madison He was baptized in June 1774 by Elder Noah Alden. Leland joined the Baptist Church in Bellingham, Massachusetts in 1775. He left for Virginia in 1775 or 1776, and ministered there until 1791, when he returned to Massachusetts. During the 1788-89 election while still living in Virginia, Leland threw his support behind James Madison due to Madison's support for religious liberty in what became the First Amendment to the Constitution, and Madison was seated in the first Congress that same year. Leland returned to Massachusetts in 1791 the year the Bill of Rights was ratified, leaving Virginia after an anti-slavery sermon. Back in New England, Leland helped to found several Baptist congregations in Connecticut, to which President Jefferson later wrote his famous letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut in 1802 regarding religious freedom. A well- known incident in Leland's life was the Cheshire Mammoth Cheese. The people of Cheshire, Massachusetts made and sent a giant block of cheese to President Thomas Jefferson. Leland took the block from Cheshire to Washington, D. C., and presented it to Jefferson on January 1, 1802. While there, Leland was even invited to preach to the Congress and the President. Of this incident he wrote, \\"In November, 1801 I journeyed to the south, as far as Washington, in charge of a cheese, sent to President Jefferson. Notwithstanding my trust, I preached all the way there and on my return. I had large congregations; let in part by curiosity to hear the Mammoth Priest, as I was called.\\" He was invited to preach a message of religious liberty in Congress upon his arrival. For Michael I. Meyerson, Leland was the most prominent religious figure of the founding era to champion universal religious freedom. John M. Cobin says that Leland held, in seminal form, to the \\"liberty of conscience\\" position on public policy theology. Leland died on January 14, 1841 in North Adams, Massachusetts. His tombstone reads, \\"Here lies the body of John Leland, of Cheshire, who labored 67 years to promote piety and vindicate the civil and religious rights of all men.\\" He was known as a hymn writer; \\"The Day Is Past and Gone, The Evening Shades Appear\\" has been included in 391 hymnals. Several of his hymns are preserved in the Sacred Harp. Leland opposed theological seminaries. Ironically, The John Leland Center for Theological Studies in Virginia is named in his honor. The school was named for Leland for three reasons: his firm stand for religious liberty for all, his opposition to slavery, and his service as a pastor and evangelist. Excerpts from his writings\\"The notion of a Christian commonwealth should be exploded forever...Government should protect every man in thinking and speaking freely, and see that one does not abuse another. The liberty I contend for is more than toleration. The very idea of toleration is despicable; it supposes that some have a pre-eminence above the rest to grant indulgence, whereas all should be equally free, Jews, Turks, Pagans and Christians.\\" - A Chronicle of His Time in Virginia. *\\"Truth disdains the aid of law for its defense ‚Äî it will stand upon its own merits.\\" - Right of Conscience Inalienable. *\\"Every man must give account of himself to God, and therefore every man ought to be at liberty to serve God in a way that he can best reconcile to his conscience. If government can answer for individuals at the day of judgment, let men be controlled by it in religious matters; otherwise, let men be free.\\" - Right of Conscience Inalienable. *\\"Resolved, that slavery is a violent deprivation of rights of nature and inconsistent with a republican government, and therefore, recommend it to our brethren to make use of every legal measure to extirpate this horrid evil from the land; and pray Almighty God that our honorable legislature may have it in their power to proclaim the great jubilee, consistent with the principles of good policy.\\" - Resolution for the General Committee of Virginia Baptists meeting in Richmond, Virginia in 1789.

The film stars Nick Adams, Kumi Mizuno, Tadao Takashima, with Koji Furuhata as Frankenstein and Haruo Nakajima as Baragon. The film was a Japanese-American co-production; it was the first collaboration between Toho and Henry G. Saperstein. In the film, scientists investigate the origins of a mysterious child and his resistance to radiation that makes him grow to monstrous size, while a second monster ravages the countryside. Frankenstein Conquers the World was released in Japan on August 8, 1965 and was given a theatrical release in the United States on July 8, 1966 by American International Pictures. In 1966, Toho/UPA released a sequel titled The War of the Gargantuas.  Plot  During World War II in Nazi Germany, Nazi officers confiscate the heart of Frankenstein's monster from Dr. Riesendorf and pass it on to the Imperial Japanese Navy, who take it to a research facility in Hiroshima for further experimentation. As the experiments begin, Hiroshima is bombed with a nuclear weapon by the Americans. 15 years later, a feral boy runs rampant in the streets of Hiroshima, catching and devouring small animals. This comes to the attention of American scientist Dr. James Bowen and his assistants, Drs. Sueko Togami and Ken'ichiro Kawaji. A year later, they find the boy hiding in a cave on a beach, cornered by outraged villagers. Bowen and his team take care of the boy and discover that he is building a strong resistance to radiation. The former Imperial Navy officer Kawai, who brought the heart to Hiroshima's army hospital, is now working in an oil factory in Akita Prefecture, when a sudden earthquake destroys the refinery. Kawai catches a glimpse of a non-human monster within a fissure before it disappears. Meanwhile, Bowen and his team find out that the strange boy is growing in size due to an intake of protein. Afraid of his strength, the scientists lock and chain the boy in a cage and Sueko, who cares for him, feeds him some protein-filled food to sustain him. Bowen is visited by Kawai, who tells him that the boy could have grown from the heart of Frankenstein's monster, as the boy was seen in Hiroshima more than once before. At Bowen's advice, Kawaji confers with Riesendorf in Frankfurt. Riesendorf recommends cutting off a limb, speculating that a new one will grow back. Sueko and Bowen strongly object to this method. Ignoring Bowen's suggestion to think it over, Kawaji tenaciously attempts to sever one of the limbs of the boy-turned-giant, now called \\"Frankenstein\\". He is interrupted by a TV crew, who enrage Frankenstein with bright studio lights and Frankenstein breaks loose. Frankenstein visits Sueko at her apartment before disappearing. Unbeknownst to Bowen and his team, the subterranean monster Baragon ravages various villages. The Japanese authorities and media believe this to be Frankenstein's doing, and the monster narrowly escapes being hunted down by the Self Defense Forces. Before Bowen and his team dismiss Frankenstein, Kawai returns to tell them that Frankenstein may not be responsible for the disasters; it could be the monster (Baragon) he saw in Akita. He tries to convince the authorities but to no avail. Kawaji still wishes the scientists luck in finding and saving Frankenstein. Bowen, Sueko, and Kawaji attempt to find Frankenstein on their own. To Bowen and Sueko's shock, Kawaji reveals his plans to kill Frankenstein by blinding him with grenades, in order to recover his heart and his brain. Kawaji presses on to find Frankenstein but finds Baragon instead. Kawaji and Bowen try in vain to stop the monster with the grenades. Frankenstein emerges in time to save Sueko and engages Baragon. The monsters battle until Frankenstein snaps Baragon's neck. Then the earth beneath them collapses and swallows them. Kawaji states that the immortal heart will live on and they may one day see him again, but Bowen believes that Frankenstein is better off dead.  Cast   Production  Furuhata and Nakajima on-set with the special effects crew. Toho had always been interested in the Frankenstein character as, in 1961, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka commissioned a film project called Frankenstein vs. the Human Vapor. Acting as a sequel to the 1960 film The Human Vapor, the Mizuno character from that film finds the Frankenstein Monster's body, and revives him, so that he can help him use the Frankenstein formula to revive his beloved girlfriend Fujichiyo (who had died at the end of said film). As a rough draft of the story was being written by Takeshi Kimura (using the pen name Kaoru Mabuchi), it was ultimately cancelled before the draft was finished. In 1962, Toho purchased a script from an independent producer from America named John Beck called King Kong vs. Prometheus. Beck had stolen the story treatment (which was originally called King Kong Meets Frankenstein) from Willis O'Brien and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay.Steve Archer. Willis O'Brien: Special Effects Genius. Mcfarland, 1993. Toho wanted to have King Kong fight their own monster Godzilla instead of the Frankenstein giant in the original story and, after working out a deal with Beck as well as RKO, the copyright holder of King Kong at the time, produced King Kong vs. Godzilla.\\"Willis O'Brien-Creator of the Impossible\\" by Don Shay. Cinefex #7. R.B Graphics. 1982. pp. 69‚Äì70 Influenced by the concept of the giant Frankenstein monster from the King Kong vs. Prometheus story, Toho planned on making Frankenstein vs. Godzilla as a follow-up to King Kong vs. Godzilla. Written in 1963 by Kimura, the story dealt with the heart of the original Frankenstein monster becoming irradiated and growing into a Frankenstein-monster giant. Afraid the giant would start eating people, Godzilla would be freed from an icy prison by the JSDF and goaded into a fight with the monster in hopes of killing him. Even though King Kong vs. Godzilla had already been made with Godzilla escaping from an iceberg that he was trapped in at the end of Godzilla Raids Again, script writer Mabuchi thought with Godzilla disappearing into the ocean at the end of that film, that the idea of Godzilla becoming frozen in the North Sea into another icy prison could still work. The story would end with natural disasters defeating the monsters as Godzilla disappears into a raging river flow, and the Frankenstein giant disappears into magma caused by an erupting volcano. Toho was not fond of the logistics of the story, so the idea was dropped. When the Godzilla series would resume a year later in 1964, Mothra was brought in as Godzilla's next opponent for the film Mothra vs. Godzilla instead. In 1965, they would finally co-produce the story with financial backing from Henry G. Saperstein's film company Henry G. Saperstein Enterprises into this film. A new dinosaurian opponent named Baragon was created to replace Godzilla as Frankenstein's opponent, and the script was slightly altered. Most of the concepts from the original story treatment were retained in this version, such as the irradiated heart of the monster, the monster's relentless pursuit of food, and a natural disaster defeating the monster during the climax. In addition, most of the characters from the original story such as research scientist Dr. Bowen (played by Nick Adams), would be retained. In the American version, Jerry Sohl would get credit for a synopsis and executive producer Reuben Bercovitch would get credit for the story. Koji Furuhata earned the role of Frankenstein's monster through an open audition. Furuhata wore green contact lenses to emulate a Caucasian look, a flat-head prosthetic and brow resembling Jack Pierce's Frankenstein Monster design, and large shirts and loincloths. Honda had originally wanted to explore more of the science-gone- wrong theme, but was forced to change the story in the middle to reach a climactic monster battle. Nick Adams delivered all of his lines in English, while everyone else delivered their lines in Japanese. = Alternate ending = Henry G. Saperstein had requested an alternative ending for the international release in which Frankenstein battled a giant octopus. This resulted in the cast and crew being reassembled after principal photography and post-production had wrapped, as well as building a new set and creating the octopus. Despite filming the new ending, Saperstein ended up cutting it regardless because he believed the octopus \\"wasn't that good\\". When the film was in production, trade magazines listed this film's title as Frankenstein vs. the Giant Devilfish. Honda had stated that the reason why the octopus ending was initially requested was because the American co-producers were \\"astonished\\" by the octopus scene in King Kong vs. Godzilla and wanted a similar scene. Honda also confirmed that various endings were shot, stating: \\"In fact Mr. Tsuburaya had shot five or six final scenes for this film. The infamous giant octopus is only one of these endings.\\" Honda also expressed that the alternate ending was never intended to be released on the Japanese version, stating: \\"there was never any official plan to utilize the sequence; but an alternative print with that ending was accidentally aired on television surprising many Japanese fans because it was not the ending they had remembered from the original theatrical release.\\"Memories of Ishiro Honda: Twenty Years After The Passing Of Godzilla's Famed Director by Hajime Ishida. Famous Monsters of Filmland #269. Movieland Classics LLC, 2013. Pg. 21 Release =Theatrical= The film was released in Japan on August 8, 1965, two days after the 20th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. The film grossed ¬•93 million during its Japanese theatrical run. The film was released theatrically in the United States as Frankenstein Conquers the World on July 8, 1966 by American International Pictures. This version was dubbed in English by Titan Productions and restored Adams' original English dialogue. =Home media= In June 2007, Tokyo Shock released Frankenstein Conquers the World on a two-disc DVD, the first time the film was released on DVD in North America. This version includes the original Japanese theatrical version, the original American English version from American International Pictures (running at 84 minutes), and the international version with the alternate giant octopus ending (running at 93 minutes). All three versions were presented in widescreen. The international version (titled Frankenstein vs. the Giant Devilfish) features an audio commentary by Sadamasa Arikawa, the film's special effects photographer. Disc two features two Japanese trailers, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery, which was provided by Ed Godziszewski (editor of Japanese Giants and author of The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Godzilla). In November 2017, Toho released the film on Blu-ray in Japan. This release also includes an HD remaster of the international version, Frankenstein vs. the Giant Devilfish.  Sequel  The following year, Toho released a sequel titled The War of the Gargantuas, also co-produced with UPA. In the film, pieces of Frankenstein's cells mutate into two giant humanoid monsters: Sanda (the Brown Gargantua) and Gaira (the Green Gargantua). The former is a benevolent and peace-loving creature, the latter is murderous and savage. Apart from a reference to a severed hand, UPA obscured all references to Frankenstein in the American version and the names of the monsters were changed to the Brown Gargantua and the Green Gargantua. Gaira and Sanda would later appear in two of Toho's tokusatsu series, Ike! Godman and Ike! Greenman, before remaining absent for over 40 years, with Gaira making his latest appearance in a 2008 Go!

It was established in 2002 at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field. The campus offers full-time and part-time professional Masters programs in Electrical And Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Software Management, various bi-coastal (split-time between Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley) Masters programs in Information Technology, and a bi-coastal Ph.D. program in Electrical and Computer Engineering. One key differentiator between programs in the traditional Pittsburgh campus and the new Silicon Valley campus is a new focus on project-centered learning by doing approach to education.  History  After years of planning from the Pittsburgh campus, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley opened in September 2002 under the name \\"Carnegie Mellon University - West Campus\\" to an original class of 56 students. Carnegie Mellon had always had a reputation for graduating bright students in engineering and technology, so it seemed only natural to establish a physical presence in the Silicon Valley, the epicenter of entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. James H. Morris, the Dean of the School of Computer Science at the Pittsburgh campus, was instrumental in establishing the West Coast initiative and served as the new campus' first dean. Raj Reddy, a Turing Award recipient and computer science professor at the Pittsburgh campus, was the school's first director. In 2008, the university's name was changed to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley to better reflect the proximity and opportunity to Silicon Valley. In 2009, Dean Morris ended his appointment, and the College of Engineering (also known as Carnegie Institute of Technology or \\"CIT\\") at Carnegie Mellon University partnered with the Silicon Valley campus to bring more resources and a stronger connection to the main campus. In 2012, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley celebrated its 10th anniversary.  Location  Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley is located on NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field. The campus (or in particular Moffett Field), is surrounded by high-tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, HP, and Lockheed Martin. Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley currently occupies Building 23 and since January 2011, a wing in Building 19, which provides space for full-time masters students, faculty and researchers. An extension for Building 19 has been in use since Fall 2012.  Programs  = Master of Science in Software Engineering (MS- SE) = In Fall 2002, Carnegie Mellon initiated a full-time and part-time Master of Science in Software Engineering degree. This program is offered under the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, and is only offered at the Silicon Valley campus. It focuses deeply on software engineering principles, and students are required to take courses in Software Engineering and Design, Analysis, and Systems. Through ties with local companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, VMWare, IBM, Oracle, and Cisco, students often participate in internships, sponsored projects, and hackathons. = Master of Science in Software Management (MSSM) = In Fall 2008, Carnegie Mellon initiated the Software Management Masters program. The program targets senior software developers and managers that wish to pursue senior management and executive careers. The full-time MSSM program focuses on Product Management, Strategy Development, Entrepreneurship, Enterprise Innovation, and Service Management. For several years, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley operated a long-distance capability to Pittsburgh's Tepper School of Business. = Master of Science in Information Technology - Mobility and Information Security (MSIT-MOB and MSIT-IT) = In Fall 2009, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley initiated bi-coastal master's degree programs in Information Technology with specializations in Mobility and Information Security through the Information Networking Institute. In the bi-coastal programs, students are required to divide their time between the campuses in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley and also complete an approved internship. = Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering = The Masters in ECE program has equivalent course requirements between the Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley campuses. The Silicon Valley campus offers strong faculty and courses in the fields of software engineering, security, wireless sensors, mobile computing, machine learning, and wireless networking. = Master of Science in Technology Ventures (MSTV) = The bi-coastal Technology Ventures degree is an interdisciplinary program offered by the Integrated Innovation Institute. This program is aimed at entrepreneurs to gain the skills necessary to successfully launch a business or venture. Students are required to spend time at both the Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley campuses. Students gain knowledge of fundamental engineering and emerging technology at the Pittsburgh campus, and gain skills of business, entrepreneurship, venture management, and product innovation at the Silicon Valley campus. = Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering = In Fall 2008, a Ph.D. program in Electrical and Computer Engineering was initiated, offering students opportunities for advanced studies and research in the fields of mobility, security, and wireless sensors and networking.  Student population  Approximately 350 students are enrolled in Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley's academic programs. With its strong technical support for long-distance learning, about 25% of the part-time student population reside outside of the Bay Area. However, with its unique location in Silicon Valley, many local students stem from prominent companies such as Yahoo, Google, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Boeing and Microsoft, providing a vibrant environment with many diverse corporate experiences. Over 600 alumni have graduated from the Silicon Valley campus since 2002, adding to the over 6000 Carnegie Mellon alumni working in the Bay Area.  Research  The campus has a growing research effort, which began in 2008 as a natural growth of the CyLab Mobility Research Center. The research primarily focused on software mobility, networking and security. CMUSV has now grown into a vibrant research community with groundbreaking initiatives in wireless sensors, machine learning, context area computing, security, energy technology, software and systems engineering and disaster management. More recently, the research efforts have grown to include Disaster Management, Language Technologies, UAVs, Antannae Optimization, Health Technology systems. Cutting-edge research centers include the CyLab Mobility Research Center, the Carnegie Mellon Innovations Lab (CMIL), the Center for Open Source Investigation (COSI), the International Center for Advanced Communication Technologies (interACT) and the Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL). The Disaster Management Initiative (DMI) was established in 2009 with the mission to provide next-generation technical solutions to disaster prediction, management and recovery.  Silicon Valley Events  Besides the educational programs, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley has also organized software-related events in Silicon Valley, such as Carnegie Mellon's Tour de Silicon Valley, where selected Carnegie Mellon students from the Pittsburgh campus are flown to Silicon Valley for a week of networking at various software companies. Currently, the school offers TOCS - \\"Talks on Computing Systems\\", a weekly talk given by a subject expert in various topics related to software and computing. These talks are open to the public in addition to the faculty and students. The school has also organized in association with the UC Berkeley, regular software conferences in the outlook of the software industry. Its first incarnation took place on April 30, 2007 at the Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus and focused on The New Software Industry - Forces at Play, Business in Motion, while the second conference took place on April 22, 2008 at the Santa Clara Convention Center and focused on The Mobile Future - Technology Revolutionizing our Lives. The campus has hosted a Disaster Management Workshop, focusing on its growing research division in Disaster Response. The 3 day event included a CrisisCamp for practitioners to come and collaborate on improving disaster relief methodologies.  The Fence  In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 presented a gift to the university by installing their own Carnegie Mellon University fence on the Silicon Valley campus. The fence is a Carnegie Mellon tradition on the main campus where different student organizations repaint a long fence in the middle of the campus to promote a cause or spread a certain message. Members of the class of 2008 collected money to hire a contractor to build and install a 10-foot fence, that was then subsequently painted with images symbolizing the west coast (like the Golden Gate Bridge, or NASA's Hangar One). The fence was dedicated to Randy Pausch who died in 2008 (the top of the fence reads \\"Dedicated to Randy Pausch\\"). The remaining money was also donated and gift-matched to a total of $1000 to the Randy Pausch Memorial Fund.  Alumni  Many of CMUSV's alumni go on to work in nearby Silicon Valley companies including Google and Facebook. ECE PhD graduate Heng-Tze Cheng created the wide and deep learning system for recommendation system at Google. Faculty Joy Ying Zhang and research staff of Mobile Technologies (creator of Jibbigo) was acquired by Facebook.

It is Carnegie Mellon's first undergraduate branch campus, is a member of the Qatar Foundation, and began graduating students in May 2008. Carnegie Mellon Qatar currently has approximately 400 students, 60 faculty and postdoctoral researchers, and 90 staff. History Carnegie Mellon University's campus in Qatar was established in 2004. It was the fourth U.S. higher education institution to establish a campus in Qatar. The establishment of the campuses was spearheaded by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the mother of Qatar‚Äôs current Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani. Academics Carnegie Mellon Qatar is part of Education City, a campus on the outskirts of Doha that currently houses eight other university campuses from the United States and Europe. Education City‚Äôs other institutions include Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Weill Cornell Medical College, Virginia Commonwealth University, Texas A&M;, Northwestern University, HEC Paris, and University College London. The degrees issued by Carnegie Mellon are the same degrees and curriculum that students receive at the Pittsburgh campus. Undergraduate degrees are offered in Computer Science, Business Administration, Information Systems, Computational Biology, and Biological Sciences (a degree offered in conjunction with Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar).  Funding  The campus facilities and upkeep to them is entirely covered by the Qatar Foundation. Carnegie Mellon also received money each year to run the campus and pay faculty. It is estimated that Carnegie Mellon has received between $50 and $60 million per year from Qatar to run the campus. Tuition for the school was $49,610 in 2015.  Faculty  As of December 2015, the campus had 62 faculty members. In a Washington Post article, the dean of the University‚Äôs Qatar campus, Ilker Baybars, called faculty recruiting ‚Äúthe most difficult part of [his] job‚Äù, noting that it is difficult to persuade tenured professors to leave America for Doha. In order to persuade professors to teach at the Doha campus, the university has provided incentives such as salary premiums, generous housing arrangements, and research funding . The atrium of Carnegie Mellon Qatar with the university motto Buildings Carnegie Mellon Qatar is housed in a building designed by architects Legorreta + Legorreta. The university began occupancy in August 2008. All academics, student affairs, operations, and events are held in the building.  Criticisms  Some have criticized the Qatari government for placing too much emphasis on and giving too much funding to international institutions of higher education which serve only the country's elite, without also demonstrating, and stimulating, the quality of national institutions. Education City has been the subject of criticism for its hosting of extremist preachers at its mosque. This is in violation of the very prominent Jeddah Communique signed by the GCC member states and the US to commit to combat the threat of terrorism. Announcements of these types of speakers are regularly promoted by Education City‚Äôs Housing and Residence Life to Education City students. While American institutions of higher education place strong emphasis on freedom of speech and religion, these types of hate preachers openly speak out against these principles and create an intolerant atmosphere for students of Education City. For this reason, Carnegie Mellon, along with other Education City institutions, has been the subject of criticism over whether the large amount of funding they receive provides an incentive for them to remain silent about hate preachers at Education City and other issues such as Qatar‚Äôs sponsorship of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS and its abysmal human rights record. Carnegie Mellon, along with the other institutions of Education City, has also been the subject of questions over how a U.S. institution that values freedom of speech can function in a country where Islamic Sharia Law is strictly enforced and the monarchy has absolute power. Critics have repeatedly called into question the role that Sharia Law plays on university campuses in Qatar and how this affects the students at Carnegie Mellon and others. Qatar also adheres to Wahhabism, one of the most fundamental sects of Islam. With these limitations in place due to Qatari societal norms, the question is raised of whether or not Carnegie Mellon and the rest of Education City can truly provide the same caliber of academic experiences as their main U.S. campuses. Criticism has not only fallen on the universities, but also on Qatar as critics question whether their motive for hosting the universities is really to improve higher education opportunities in Qatar, or rather that it is more about exporting their beliefs.

They delivered a standards-based infrastructure that attempted to leverage open systems to the largest degree possible, while adapting specific input/output to meet the customer's exact requirements. OpenSky received the direct attention of Tyco Electronics when they acquired it along with AMP Inc.. Tyco Electronics funded the company to acquire the EDACS radio system team and product line.

The excess mucus accumulates in the back of the nose, and eventually in the throat once it drips down the back of the throat. It can be caused by rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD / GORD), or by a disorder of swallowing (such as an esophageal motility disorder). Other causes can be allergy, cold, flu, and side effects from medications. However, some researchers argue that the flow of mucus down the back of the throat from the nasal cavity is a normal physiologic process that occurs in all healthy individuals. Post-nasal drip has been challenged as a syndrome and instead is widely viewed as a symptom by various researchers as a result of the wide variation among differing societies. Furthermore, this rebuttal is reinforced because of the lack of an accepted definition, pathologic tissue changes, and available biochemical tests. Signs and symptoms PND may present itself through the constant presence of discomfort in the upper airways. This is caused by the flow of mucus from nasal membranes down the back of the throat, triggering a cough. The cough can become more pronounced in some cases as the result of heightened response to infections. GERD (GORD) is often associated with a high prevalence of upper-respiratory symptoms similar to those of PND, such as coughing, throat clearing, hoarseness and change in voice. Reflux causes throat irritation, leading to a sensation of increased mucus in the throat, which is believed to aggravate and, in some cases, cause post-nasal drip. Post-nasal drip can be a cause of laryngeal inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, leading to symptoms of vocal cord dysfunction. Diagnosis A prolonged period of examination based on information gathered from the patient regarding the chronology of the dripping sensation in the throat, evident within PND, can be unreliable and cause bias in diagnosing the syndrome itself in the absence of any accurate and objective diagnostic tests. As such, suggestive procedures that highlight rhinitis and mucopurulent secretions, such as nasoendoscopy, may instead be utilised because of the vague nature of information available to directly attribute specific symptoms to the syndrome. Treatment Treatment options depend on the nature of an individual‚Äôs post-nasal drip and its cause. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the PND is the result of a bacterial infection. Antihistamines are recommended if the PND is caused by allergies. However, first-generation antihistamines can have side effects, including drowsiness. Nasal steroid treatments, such as fluticasone propionate, may also provide relief. Decongestants such as pseudoephedrine cause a reduction in membranes through the tightening of blood vessels, which results in reduced PND. Staying hydrated and avoiding alcoholic and caffeinated products that can worsen symptoms is key. Avoiding cigarette smoke is also recommended because it can cause increased discomfort if inhaled. Drinking more fluids, especially those that can thin mucus (such as hot liquids), can be beneficial. Nasal irrigations such as saline-based nose sprays can be used to help with secretions in the throat that may cause discomfort. Physicians may also prescribe steroid-based nasal sprays, which are safe and more effective than over-the-counter decongestant sprays that may only remain helpful for a limited period of time.

Stevie Ray is best known for his seven-year tenure with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1993 to 2000, where he was one-half of the tag team Harlem Heat, with his younger brother Booker T. Huffman, better known as Booker T. They won the WCW World Tag Team Championship a record ten times. Huffman is also a one-time WCW World Television Champion. Among other events, he headlined the Fall Brawl 1993 and 1998 pay-per-views. Huffman, as part of Harlem Heat, was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2019. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989‚Äì1993)= Lash Huffman started wrestling in 1989 as Super Collider on the independent circuit in Texas. In Ivan Putski's Western Wrestling Alliance, he first started feuding with his brother, Booker (who was G.I. Bro at the time) under the ring name Jive Soul Bro. He began teaming with his brother as Stevie Ray (named after a combination of musical artists Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles) in a tag team called The Ebony Experience for the Global Wrestling Federation, which was on ESPN. They were faces and feuded with the \\"Blackbirds\\" of Iceman King Parsons and Brickhouse Brown. They won the GWF Tag Team Championship three times. Stevie Ray then went on to win the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship in 1993. =World Championship Wrestling= Harlem Heat (1993‚Äì1997) In August 1993, they went to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and changed their team name to Harlem Heat. Initially Lash was known as Kane while Booker became Kole. They were then billed from Harlem. They became heels and were on Harley Race and Col. Rob Parker's team in the War Games at Fall Brawl on September 19, 1993, with Vader and Sid Vicious against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes and The Shockmaster. They lost the match when Shockmaster forced Booker (Kole) to submit. In 1994, they got Sister Sherri as their manager and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray. They feuded with Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Buff Bagwell) and won the WCW Tag Team Titles for the first time. From there, they feuded with The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) and got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck where Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair. During this time, Stevie and Booker lost the titles to the Nasty Boys, regained them, then lost them to Slater and Buck and regained them again. They eventually gained Parker as a manager as he abandoned Slater and Buck to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat won the WCW World Tag Team Championship three times in 1995, trading the titles with The American Males (Bagwell and Scotty Riggs) in the early fall. They had brief feuds with Lex Luger and Sting, trading the titles back and forth in early 1996 and The Road Warriors before starting a long feud with Rick and Scott Steiner in 1996. In October, they lost their titles to The Outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, when Nash used Parker's cane to attack Stevie. They would then fire the Colonel, beat him up, turn face, and enter into a brief feud against Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they would win. In 1997 they feuded with Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock), The Steiners and the New World Order. In the summer of 1997, they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline. They were briefly put out of action by the nWo and returned to feud with The Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Singles appearances; New World Order (1998‚Äì1999) As 1998 started to roll around, Stevie had to take some time off from WCW from January to June. Meanwhile, Booker T would go on to win WCW World Television Championship. Through the association with his brother, he would gain his only singles title in WCW, as when Booker took time off with an injury as Television Champion from July to October, Stevie got a \\"power of attorney\\" to defend the belt for Booker. He then engaged in a short feud with Chavo Guerrero, Jr. over the right to defend the belt before dropping it to Chris Jericho afterwards. By June 1998, Stevie Ray had returned to the ring, and the powerful gang-like faction of the nWo had been split into two: Hollywood Hogan's nWo Hollywood and Kevin Nash's nWo Wolfpac. Stevie Ray would be offered a spot in nWo Hollywood, but was hesitant at first. He would join the \\"black & white\\" in August, effectively turning him heel. Although this would make Stevie Ray known for using dirty tactics and a strength-in-numbers mentality, his brother, Booker, showed little resentment and respected Stevie Ray's decision to be a part of the nWo, and they were able to peacefully co- exist. Meanwhile, Booker was steadily gaining popularity as a face, climbing the ranks of the WCW roster and winning championship titles. During his tenure with the nWo, Stevie Ray would tag team with the likes of Horace Hogan and Scott Norton as well as performing in singles competition, often with Vincent at ringside. Alongside Hollywood Hogan and Bret Hart, he also participated in the War Games of Fall Brawl 1998. The slapjack became known as Stevie Ray's trademark weapon which he would frequently use to knock an opponent unconscious, typically when the referee was distracted. By early 1999, both nWo factions had fused back together, but members of nWo Hollywood started bickering over who the leader of the sub-faction was. Hollywood Hogan began telling various members in private that he had granted them official leadership, causing confusion and friction between members. Not long after, Stevie Ray won the leadership role in a 4-man battle royal on the April 5, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, defeating Horace Hogan, Brian Adams, and Vincent. Harlem Heat reformation (1999) As tension grew between members of nWo Hollywood, Stevie Ray started helping Booker T during his matches. As Booker was getting ganged up on in July, the two reunited Harlem Heat. They began feuding with Barry and Kendall Windham as well as The Jersey Triad of Diamond Dallas Page, Chris Kanyon and Bam Bam Bigelow. They went on to win the Tag Titles three more times, making them 10 time champions. Feud with Booker T (1999‚Äì2000) By late 1999, a female bodybuilder named Midnight had joined Harlem Heat. Stevie resented her help and started disputing with Booker over her. He eventually challenged Midnight in a match that would decide whether or not she would stay with Harlem Heat. After being defeated with a surprise small package, Stevie Ray would turn on both Booker and Midnight to form Harlem Heat, Inc. with Big T, Kash and J. Biggs. They won the rights to the Harlem Heat name in a match with Big T against Booker on February 20, 2000 at SuperBrawl X. Color commentator (2000) In May, Stevie split from Big T, Kash and Biggs (who all left WCW) and helped Booker T out of a jam. He then retired from in-ring competition to become a color commentator for WCW Thunder. As a commentator, Stevie referred to all of the women as \\"yaks\\" and coined his catchphrase \\"Suckas gots to know!\\" He also provided in-depth analysis from a wrestler's point of view during matches and constantly criticized wrestlers for mistakes made in the ring. For example, he would often say that a wrestler \\"should have went [sic] for the cover!\\" or \\"needed to hook the leg!\\" and this advice earned him the nickname, \\"Straightshootin'\\" Stevie Ray. Stevie came back for one more WCW match (a title vs. career match) for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Scott Steiner on the November 27, 2000 edition of WCW Monday Nitro, which he lost. =World Wrestling All-Stars (2002)= Stevie Ray wrestled a few matches for WWA against Ernest Miller in 2002, retiring later that year. =Semi- retirement= In 2005, Stevie Ray and Booker T opened the \\"Booker T and Stevie Ray Pro Wrestling Academy\\" in Houston, Texas. In April 2013, Stevie Ray inducted Booker T into the WWE Hall of Fame. On February 21, 2015, Booker T and Stevie Ray reunited as Harlem Heat for one last match at Booker T's promotion, Reality of Wrestling's \\"The Final Heat\\" event, where they defeated the Heavenly Bodies for the ROW Tag Team Championship. On March 14, the titles were vacated. On March 30, 2016, Stevie Ray debuted a new weekly radio talk show, Straight Shooting with Stevie Ray which airs on KCOH radio 92.9 FM HD2 every Wednesday. He is also the host of the podcast Stand Up for Greatness. In 2015 Ray was added to WWE 2K16 as DLC.

Ultima Thule glassware Porcelain \\"paper bag\\" vase for Rosenthal, cca 1970 Tapio Veli Ilmari Wirkkala (2 June 1915 ‚Äì 19 May 1985) was a Finnish designer and sculptor, a major figure of post-war design. Life and work Wirkkala was born in Hanko in 1915. He attended the T√∂√∂l√∂ co-educational school in Helsinki. His father, Ilmari Wirkkala, was a cemetery architect, and mother Selma (n√©e Vanhatalo) a wood-carver. His sister Helena Korvenkontio and brother Tauno Wirkkala were also artists. Wirkkala's work ranges from designs of plastic ketchup bottles and metalware to glass, ceramics and plywood in a range of styles. His success as a glass designer began in 1946 when he designed the Kantarelli vase for Iittala, and the mass-produced Tapio collection was launched in 1954. His range was immense, including glassware, stoneware, jewelry, and furniture for mass production, as well as individual sculptures in several media. He also designed the Finnish markka banknotes introduced in 1955. In the early 1950s, Wirkkala worked as the artistic director at the Helsinki Central School of Industrial Design. Among his most famous work have been the designs for the Finlandia vodka bottle (1970-1999) and for Iittala's Ultima Thule set of kitchen glasses. Both glassware items feature a dripping icicle look, and in the case of the Iittala's glassware it is said to have taken thousands of hours to develop a glassblowing technique that would produce the effect. Wirkkala did much of his initial design work using a traditional Finnish carving knife, the puukko. Wirkkala designed his own version of the knife, the Tapio Wirkkala Puukko, which was manufactured by Hackman Cutlery and marketed by Brookstone in the US in the early-1970s. Wirkkala died in Helsinki on 19 May 1985 and was buried in the artists' area of the Hietaniemi Cemetery, next to his wife Rut Bryk.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Astronomers in 1880 . He saw active military service in South Africa and his final rank was that of a Major.  Personal life  Eddie was the son of an army Surgeon, William Cruikshank Eddie and Sarah Eddie (n√©e Kaye). He had one brother and one sister. He grew up in Grahamstown and joined the civil service of the Cape of Good Hope in 1878. By 1892 he was clerk to judge Jones of the Eastern District Court, where he and W.G. Atherstone were asked to analyse a judgement of a libel case that a jury had been unable to decide. The case revolved around W.B. Shaw who had accused dean Williams of St Michael and St George Cathedral, Grahamstown of being a liar. He served in the military for 20 years. In 1876 he commanded the Grahamstown Rifles during an invasion of Xhosas just prior to the 9th Xhosa War. In 1885 he was a lieutenant in command of the Bechuanaland Expedition led by Charles Warren. His final rank was that of a Major when he retired in 1901. On 2 September 1873, he married Hermina Fredrica Upton at St Bartholomews Anglican church in Grahamstown and they had five children. He died on 13 October 1913 in Grahamstown.  Astronomy  During his early education he spent some time under the guidance of Dr. Richards (later Bishop Richards) who inspired him in his astronomical pursuits. His initial equipment was a 9.5-inch reflecting telescope in Grahamstown but he later used a 76 mm refractor and a more powerful 240 mm reflector. David Gill He made many useful observations including observations of 21 comets, although he never discovered any himself. The transit of Venus on 6 December 1882, which he observed from Fort Selwyn, near Grahamstown was one of the highlights of his observational career. He was assisted in this observation by the mayor of Grahamstown, J.S. Willcox, a jeweler who provided a chronometer with which to time the observations. Two astronomers at the Royal Observatory in Cape Town, D. Gill and W.H. Finlay sent a series of telegraphed time signals to Eddie which allowed him to correct the chronometer. Over the 20 years of his career, some of his results were published in seven papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, including an extensive series of observations of Comet 1882b. He published several other papers in other journals, such as his observation on the lunar eclipse of 11 March 1895 in Popular Astronomy and a curious meteor trail seen at Grahamstown on 22 October 1895, also published in Popular Astronomy. His contributions to the Journal of the British Astronomical Association included notes on a brilliant meteor and the colours and spectra of 100 southern stars in 1894 and the conjunction of the moon with Venus in 1903. He observed a transit of Mercury in 1894 and in 1907 he studied the planet Mars with great detail and published drawings that were highly acclaimed by E. M. Antoniadi of the Mars section of the British Astronomical Association. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 14 May 1880. From 1881 to 1898 he regularly published his observations of comets in the local newspaper, the Grahamstown Journal, including observations of Fabry's comet (1886), Swift's Comet (1892) and Gale's Comet (1894).

Ferr√© Performing Arts Center (Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferr√© in Spanish) is a multi-use performance centre located in the barrio of Santurce in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It features three main concert and theater halls for plays, ballet, operas and concerts. It was renamed in 1994 after the late Puerto Rican philanthropist, politician and Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis A. Ferr√©. The Center opened on April 9, 1981 under the administration of Governor Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ after ten years of planning, project financing, and construction. Since then, it has become the most important performing arts venue in the Puerto Rican capital, presenting the highest level of commercial theater in Puerto Rico along with ballets and operas, and also hosting artists such as Pl√°cido Domingo and Menudo. The Center is home to the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and the annual Casals Festival. In January 2019, Lin-Manuel Miranda‚Äôs musical Hamilton began its third touring production at the venue, with Miranda reprising the titular role of Founding Father and Secretary of Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, with higher praise than his original run on Broadway. Miranda returned to the venue after nine years since he reprised the role of Usnavi exclusively in San Juan during the North American touring production of In the Heights, which he also wrote. Facilities The Center features four main concert and theater halls, two eateries and a central outdoor plaza, each with its own unique features: * Antonio Paoli Festival Hall ‚Äì Dedicated to a Puerto Rican opera singer, it is the largest hall of the Center. Seating is between 1,875 and 1,945, and features two stories with VIP balconies, world-class acoustic system, and a stage perfect for scenic musical performances including, operas, ballet, popular music shows, and symphonic concerts. * Ren√© Marqu√©s Theater Hall ‚Äì Dedicated to one of Puerto Rico‚Äôs most famous playwrights and essayists, this hall seats between 748 and 781 guests and with a stage measuring 42 by 40 feet, it is specially designed for plays and musical performances. * Carlos Marichal Performance Hall ‚Äì dedicated to a respected Puerto Rican set and costume designer, the hall features seating for 210 guests in an intimate arena-styled theater. * Sala Sinf√≥nica Pablo Casals ‚Äì symphony hall dedicated to the Spanish Catalan cellist and conductor best remembered for the recording the Bach Cello Suites he made from 1936 to 1939. The $34 million building, designed by Rodolfo Fernandez and Acentech Incorporated's Studio A, seats 1,300 and serves as the new home of the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra.http://www.acentech.com/studio_a/sala-sinfonica.html * Juan Morel Campos Plaza, dedicated to the Puerto Rican composer of danzas is located right in front of the Center‚Äôs main entrance, it is a large open plaza featuring a pair of sculptures called The Muses and the Las Tablas Restaurant, and is available for outdoor activities and presentations for 800 guests. * Sylvia Rexach Theater Caf√© ‚Äì Designed to be a fourth, but smaller, concert hall, the Caf√© opened in 1988 and offers a relaxed nightclub theme for up to 200 guests with a small stage for intimate performances. A xylographic mural by famed local artist Antonio Martorell decorates its walls and grants homage to Sylvia Rexach, the famous Puerto Rican bolero singer and composer. * Las Tablas Restaurant (formerly the Arts Pavilion) ‚Äì is a restaurant within the Juan Morel Campos Plaza and features an award-winning architectural design. The restaurant, whose theme literally embodies the phrase The Beauty of the Caribbean, is owned by international pop star Luis Fonsi and local music and concert producer Tony Mojena. Its menu, developed by Giovanna Huyke, is built around the theme the taste of music, and consists mostly of local traditional foods prepared by its in-house chef Alexis Bartolomei. Surrounding art The Center is surrounded by various art expositions, including murals, paintings, and sculptures. The two largest halls feature art expositions which distinguishes each one: * In the Antonio Paoli Festival Hall‚Äôs second floor, a mural titled La Plena by Rafael Tufi√±o is on display and represents twelve famous Puerto Rican plenas by local songwriter Manuel ‚ÄúCanario‚Äù Jim√©nez: Cortaron an Elena; Temporal; El Perro de San Jer√≥nimo; Josefina; Santa Mar√≠a; Tintorera del Mar; Fuego, Fuego, Fuego; Monch√≠n del Alma; Cuando las Mujeres; Tanta Vanidad; Lola; and El Diablo Colorao. The mural was created 30 years before the opening of the Center between 1952 and 1954. It was moved to its current place in 1987 after a three-year restoration project by Anton Konrad. * In the Ren√© Marqu√©s Hall, a stained glass exposition titled Form and Tropical Crystals by local artist Luis Hern√°ndez Cruz illuminates its lobby with 5,700 multi-colored pieces of crystal arranged to showcase themes related to the sea, the forest, the sky and the overall tropical ambiance. Near the entrance of the Center, various expositions greet guests and visitors, including a aluminum sculpture by Luis Torruella titled Melodic Reflection. However, the main art theme of the Center‚Äôs entrance are The Muses. These are two separate works of art, one being an assortment of bronze female sculptures along the Juan Morel Campos Plaza, by Annex Burgos; and the second being a large mural at the Center‚Äôs fa√ßade (pictured above), made from a mixture concrete and crystal stones and designed by Augusto Mar√≠n. Each muse represents the different arts and cultures which the Center embraces, including local and classical music, theater, literature, dance, films, architecture, sculptures, and painting.  Location  Located along the Ponce de Leon Avenue in the Santurce section of San Juan, the center is located near various retail shops and residential buildings, which produce a vibrant atmosphere around the center both day and night. It has an underground parking garage offering 483 spaces for guests, although adjacent office buildings provide additional spaces.

A suicide bridge is a bridge used frequently to die by suicide, most typically by jumping off and into the water or ground below. A fall from the height of a tall bridge into water may be fatal, although people have survived jumps from high bridges such as the Golden Gate Bridge. Medical examiners at the Golden Gate Bridge state that jumpers suffer a gruesome death as their bodies hit the water at about , with severe organ damage (multiple ruptured organs and necks, pelvises, etc.). However, significant injury or death is far from certain; numerous studies report minimally injured persons who succumbed to drowning.Stephanian, D. url = https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0387208 title = Outcomes in suicidal bridge jumping in the Lower Mainland date = December, 2019 To reach such locations, those with the intention to die by suicide must often walk long distances to reach the point where they finally decide to jump. For example, some individuals have traveled over the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge by car in order to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge. Prevention Suicide prevention advocates believe that suicide by bridge is more likely to be impulsive than other means, and that barriers can have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of suicides by bridge. One study showed that installing barriers on the Duke Ellington Bridge in Washington, D.C.which has a high incidence of suicidedid not cause an increase of suicides at the nearby Taft Bridge. A similar result was seen when barriers were erected on the popular suicide bridge: the Clifton Suspension Bridge, in the United Kingdom. Families affected and groups that help the mentally ill have lobbied governments to erect similar barriers. One such barrier is the Luminous Veil on the Prince Edward Viaduct in Toronto, Canada, once considered North America's second deadliest bridge, with over 400 jumps on record. Special telephones with connections to crisis hotlines are sometimes installed on bridges. Examples =Australia= Free telephones linked to suicide prevention hotline installed at the Story Bridge footpath in Brisbane Suicide prevention barrier at the Story Bridge in Brisbane The Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Mooney Mooney Bridge on the Central Coast (New South Wales), and the Westgate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia and the Story Bridge in Brisbane are considered suicide bridges. Sydney Harbour Bridge has a suicide prevention barrier. In February 2009, following the murder of a four-year-old girl who was thrown off the bridge by her father, the first stage of a temporary suicide barrier was erected on Westgate Bridge, constructed of concrete crash barriers topped with a welded mesh fence. The permanent barrier has now been completed throughout the span of the bridge. The barriers are costed at $20 million and have been reported to have reduced suicide rates on the Westgate by 85%. Suicide prevention barriers were installed on the Story Bridge in 2013; a three-metre- high barrier run the full length of both sides of the bridge. =Canada=There are a number of suicide bridges in the greater Vancouver area, the most frequented being the Lions Gate Bridge, which saw 324 suicidal incidents, including 78 jumps from 2006 to 2017.Stephanian, D. url = https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0387208 title = Outcomes in suicidal bridge jumping in the Lower Mainland date = December, 2019 *The High Level Bridge (Edmonton) in Edmonton, Alberta, is considered a suicide bridge. It is unknown how many deaths have occurred at the bridge, but there have been at least 25 in total, with 10 being from 2012‚Äì2013. There have also been many failed attempts at the bridge. A suicide prevention barrier has been installed along with signage and support phone lines. *The Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, Quebec, is considered a suicide bridge. In 2004, a suicide prevention barrier was installed. Until then the bridge saw an average of 10 suicides a year. *The Prince Edward Viaduct, commonly referred to as the Bloor Viaduct, in Toronto, Ontario, was considered a suicide bridge. With nearly 500 suicides by 2003, the Viaduct was ranked as the second most fatal standing structure in North America, after the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Suicides dropped to zero after a barrier was completed in 2003. *The Lethbridge Viaduct in Lethbridge, Alberta, also known as the High Level Bridge, locally known as the Deathbridge, is considered a suicide bridge. It is unknown how many deaths have occurred at the bridge in its 107 year long history. Suicide prevention signage has been installed at the entrance to the bridge, however no further prevention program is in development. *The Angus L. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has been used for suicide attempts. As of 2010, safety barriers have been installed the full length of the pedestrian walkway. *Burgoyne Bridge in St. Catharines, Ontario has had several suicides since 2018, mostly young adults or people who were turned away from the nearby hospital for psychiatric treatment. Volunteers have started to position themselves at key points on the bridge, in the hopes of stopping further suicides. =Czech Republic= About 300 people have jumped to their death from the Nusle Bridge, in Prague, Czech Republic. Barriers almost 3 metres high were erected here in 1997 with aim to prevent further jumps. In 2007, the fencing was topped off with a of polished metal to make it impossible to climb. The in Kladno has also been described as a suicide bridge and \\"second Nusle\\". Between 2013 and 2018, 23 suicides were attempted there. Because it is only from the ground, attempts are not always successful, however the bridge is easy to access and there is no suicide barrier. =South Africa=88 people have jumped to their death from the Van Stadens Bridge, near Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa. A barrier has since been installed. =South Korea= As a suicide prevention initiative, this sign on the Mapo Bridge in Seoul, South Korea displays reassuring messages to potential suicide victims. The phrase on this particular handrail pictured reads: \\"The wind is really nice.\\" *The Mapo Bridge in Seoul, South Korea has been used for suicides frequently, leading to its nicknames of \\"Suicide Bridge\\" and \\"The Bridge of Death\\". South Korean authorities have tried to counter this by nicknaming the bridge \\"The Bridge of Life\\" and posting reassuring messages on the ledges. =United Kingdom=The Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and was opened in 1864. Since then, it has gained a reputation as a suicide bridge, with over 500 deaths from jumping. It has plaques that advertise the telephone number of The Samaritans. In 1998, the bridge was fitted with suicide barriers, which halved the suicide rate in the years following. CCTV is also installed on the bridge. *A notable suicide bridge in London is the Hornsey Lane Bridge, which passes over Archway Road and connects the Highgate and Crouch End areas. The bridge provides views of notable landmarks such as St. Paul's Cathedral, The Gherkin and The Shard. It was the venue for the mental illness campaign group Mad Pride's inaugural vigil in 2000, and was the subject of Johnny Burke's 2006 film The Bridge. When, at the end of 2010, three men in three weeks committed suicide by jumping from the bridge, a campaign was set up by local residents for better anti-suicide measures to be put in place. In October 2015 Islington Council and Haringey Council approved Transport for London's plans for the construction of a safety fence.In summer 2019, Haringey Council installed additional measures to prevent suicide from the bridge in the form of 3m high fence. *At the Humber Bridge in Hull More than 200 incidents of people jumping or falling from the bridge have taken place since opening in 1981. Between 1990 and February 2001 the Humber Rescue Team was called 64 times to deal with people falling or jumping off the bridge. *Another notable suicide bridge is Itchen Bridge in Southampton, situated over the mouth of the Itchen at its convergence with the Test. The Itchen Bridge has seen over 200 suicides since opening and a Samaritans notice and intercom have been installed. * Overtoun Bridge near Dumbarton in West Dunbartonshire has been publicised due to dogs appearing to commit suicide by jumping or falling from the bridge, which was also involved in a human murder and attempted suicide. Attempts have been made to explain the death of the dogs as due to repeated accidents. =United States= Suicide hotline on the George Washington Memorial Bridge, Seattle, Washington. *The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco has the second highest number of suicides in the world (after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge) with around 1,600 bodies having been recovered as of 2012, and the assumption of many more unconfirmed deaths. In 2004, documentary filmmaker Eric Steel set off controversy by revealing that he had tricked the bridge committee into allowing him to film the Golden Gate for months and had captured 23 suicides on film for his documentary The Bridge (2006). In March 2005, San Francisco supervisor Tom Ammiano proposed funding a study on erecting a suicide barrier on the bridge. In June 2014, a suicide barrier was approved for the Golden Gate bridge. Barrier construction began in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2021. *In Seattle, Washington, more than 230 people have died by suicide from the George Washington Memorial Bridge, making it the second deadliest suicide bridge in the United States. In a span of a decade ending in January 2007, nearly 50 people jumped to their deaths, nine in 2006. At a cost of $5,000,000, a suicide barrier was completed on February 16, 2011. *The San Diego-Coronado Bridge is the third-deadliest suicide bridge in the United States, followed by the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida. *The Cold Spring Canyon Arch Bridge along State Route 154 in Santa Barbara County, California has seen 55 jumps by suicide since opening in 1964, including 7 in 2009. A proposal to install a barrier on this bridge in 2005 led to the completion of a safety barrier/fence in March, 2012. *Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena, California, has also seen barriers erected. *During the mid-20th century in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Wissahickon Memorial Bridge had a policeman stationed after it opened because of the numerous suicides taking place. *In recent years, the Eads Bridge, connecting St. Louis, Missouri and East St. Louis, Illinois, has seen several suicides, approximately 18 since its re-opening. *Cornell University has had a number of suicides by jumping from the bridges over the gorges in the campus from the 1970s to 2010. *New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville, West Virginia *Suicide Bridge Road is located just off Maryland Route 14 near the town of Secretary, Maryland. *The Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland. *Several Bridges in the New York metropolitan area such as the old Tappan Zee Bridge, George Washington bridge, and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

Plot While driving along a highway in fictional Angel County in California, a sheriff's deputy, Martin Gordon (Vic Savage) and his wife Brett (Shannon O'Neil) meet Martin's uncle, sheriff Ben (Byrd Holland), and together they investigate a reported plane crash site. At the site, the group encounters the abandoned truck of a forest ranger, the ranger's hat, and an alien spacecraft that resembles a camping trailer; a large, slow-moving, slug- like creature had earlier emerged from the craft, and departed prior to the group's arrival. Believing the absent ranger might be inside, Ben enters the craft by crawling underneath it. Shortly thereafter loud screams, along with growls like those of a lion, are heard from the craft, after which Martin radios for help. In response to Martin's request for assistance, a \\"special unit\\" of military troops, commanded by Col. James Caldwell (John Caresio) and traveling in the back of a light-duty, civilian truck arrives at the site. Two of the troops enter the craft, examine its contents, and report back to Caldwell the presence inside of a large, tethered creature. The next day, \\"the world's leading authority on space emissions,\\" Dr. Bradford (William Thourlby), arrives to direct the ongoing investigation, which includes examination of the creature and the spacecraft's analog devices. As the investigation proceeds, the departed creature stalks the countryside and, despite its markedly awkward and slow pace of ambulation, successfully approaches, attacks and eats a bikini-clad girl, a housewife hanging laundry, Grandpa Brown (Jack King) and his grandson Bobby (Pierre Kopp), picnickers at a \\"hootenanny\\" (one of whom attempts to stop the creature by swatting it with a guitar), numerous teenage couples, including a blonde girl in gold pants (Louise Lawson), at a community dance hall (at which time some attendees engage each other in fisticuffs), and couples in their cars at a lovers' lane (about which the film's narrator states that \\"anyone who experienced that catastrophe, and survived, would never go there again.\\") Following the lover's lane incident, Caldwell orders his troops to attack the creature, telling Bradford that the creature would be captured alive if possible. This attack is accomplished by the troops standing close together, walking slowly toward the creature as a unit, and firing their small caliber firearms. The attack proves ineffective, however, and failing to retreat or otherwise walk away, all but two of the troops are devoured. Caldwell then decides to throw a live grenade, with the resultant explosion destroying the creature. After briefly examining the dead creature's tissue, Bradford hurriedly returns to the spacecraft and therein somehow triggers an explosion. Although this explosion mortally injures Bradford, it does not damage the craft or its instrumentation, and it allows the tethered creature to exit. As the creature prepares to devour Bradford, it is killed in a collision with Martin's arriving police car. Bradford then explains to Martin and Brett that the creatures were \\"mobile\\" laboratories designed to consume human beings, analyze the bodies chemically to detect weaknesses, and from the spacecraft transmit the acquired information into outer space. Although Martin fails to destroy the spacecraft's transmitter equipment, the dying Bradford says that the creatures' home planet might not even exist anymore, concluding that \\"only God knows for sure.\\" Cast Vic Savage as Martin Gordon * Shannon O'Neil as Brett Gordon * William Thourlby as Dr. Bradford * John Caresio as Col.

J. Nelson. Although Robert Silliphant is the credited writer, the original story was written by his younger brother Allan Silliphant (later known as Al Silliman Jr., and who would go on to write, produce, and direct the 1969 softcore comedy film The Stewardesses). Silliphant's other brother, Stirling, was at the time a successful writer, having written extensively for television shows that included Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Perry Mason, and he co- created Naked City and Route 66. Savage used this familial association to attract potential investors for the film: in exchange for receiving any of the film's profits, for a few hundred dollars Savage reportedly offered these investors a small part in the film. When interviewed by director Pete Schuermann for The Creep Behind the Camera (aka Creep!) (2014), a docudrama film about the making of The Creeping Terror, Allan Silliphant claimed he was paid $1,500 by Savage. Following this payment, the then 21-year-old Silliphant returned three days later with the original nine-page film treatment that he had \\"made up\\" based only on an earlier, vague idea for the story. Later in the production there was conflict between writer and director, with Silliphant frustrated that Savage did not share his vision that the story was intended to be outrageous. This conflict, and Silliphant's belief that the film would harm, rather than enhance, his family's reputation, especially that of his brother Stirling, ultimately led to his departure from the production.Snoonian, Mike. \\"An interview with Pete Schuermann, director of 'The Creep Behind the Camera'.\\" filmthrills.com, September 17, 2014.

When the film's special effects creator was not paid for his work, he allegedly stole the original creature costume a day prior to shooting, forcing Savage and his remaining crew to assemble a poorly constructed replica.

There is minimal dialogue in the film, with nearly all vocalization provided in expository format by a narrator. This is because Savage either shot scenes without regard to the professional quality of the sound, the sound was improperly transferred (or not transferred at all, as a cost-saving measure) to 35mm mag stock, or the original soundtracks were lost.\\"Trivia: 'The Creeping Terror'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: May 10, 2016.Medved 2004, p. 198. Having insufficient funds to pay for basic sound transfers or extensive post-production dubbing, Savage ultimately hired Larry Burrell, a radio news reader whose other film credits include They Saved Hitler's Brain and the nudie cutie Not Tonight Henry, to narrate the entire film. Although a minor amount of poor-quality re-dubbing was performed, the narrator speaks over most of the dialogue in the film, and long intervals devoid of dialogue have no narration, similar in style to many educational films produced in the 1950s and 1960s. Savage might have checked into a motel with a silent picture-only Moviola to quickly assemble the finished film. Prior to the film's alleged release, however, Savage was repeatedly sued, and facing a possible indictment on charges of fraud, he vanished. Savage/Nelson/White was apparently never heard from again in the context of film production, and he reportedly died of liver failure in 1975, aged 41. In 2009, his wife Lois wrote a \\"tell-all\\" novel that featured her life with Savage, albeit using aliases.Wiseman 2009, p. verso.

Although well-received critically, the album was not a commercial success, only reaching number 180 in the Billboard Top 200 album chart. Videos were made for \\"I'm Bored\\" and \\"Five Foot One\\".  Critical reception  New Values has been well received by critics. Writing in NME at the time of the album's release, Paul Morley wrote that New Values \\"conclusively endorses Osterberg as thinker and Iggy as performer, and the relationship is positive and proud.\\" Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters wrote that the album's \\"delicate balancing act of tough with tender, rebellion with contentment, sincerity with humor, cocksure wailing with nuanced balladeering ... makes the album a winner\\".  Legacy  David Bowie later covered the New Values track \\"Don't Look Down\\" on his album Tonight (1984) and used it for the opening and closing titles of his short film Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Pixies frontman Frank Black cited New Values as one of his favorite albums. \\"The Endless Sea\\" was covered by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church on their 1999 covers album A Box of Birds.

The CPF is an employment-based savings scheme with the help of employers and employees contributing a mandated amount to the fund for their benefits. It is administered by the Central Provident Fund Board, a statutory board operating under the Ministry of Manpower which is responsible for investing contributions. History of CPF Robinson Road. It was sold to Ascendas Land in 2015 with the last tenant moving out on 20 February 2017. British colonial authorities in Singapore, proposed by David Marshall via the Progressive Party committee, created the Central Provident Fund in 1955 as a compulsory savings scheme to assist workers to provide for their retirement without needing to introduce a more extensive and costly old age pension. Money contributed to the Central Provident Fund earned a nominal rate of return. The Central Provident Fund was expanded in 1968 to provide for housing expenses under the Public Housing Scheme. In 1984 the Central Provident Fund was again expanded to cover medical care expenses. In 1986 an investment option was added to give members the opportunity to manage their own risk and returns. In 1987, the Minimum Retirement Sum Scheme annuity was introduced. In 1990, MediShield health insurance funded by Central Provident Fund savings, was launched to provide universal healthcare to all Singaporeans. Later programs includes interest rate top up of 1% for the first $60,000 of retirement savings, the Workfare Income Supplement which supplements retirement savings for low-income older workers, and the Pioneer Generation Package which provides additional support for the medical expenses of older workers. When the CPF was started in 1955, both employees and employers contributed 5% of an employee's pay to the scheme. The rate of contribution was progressively increased to 25% for both employers and employees in 1985. The employer contribution was cut to 10% during a recession in 1986. The employer contribution rate was reverted to match the employee rate until the 1997‚Äì1998 Asian Financial Crisis, and thereafter lowered to 10% for workers 55 years or younger. Since then, the employer contribution rate has been gradually increased.US Embassy (2003). The Providence Fund: Challenges Ahead, http://singapore.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/_QF6LGQgjmWlzUvlCufN4A/CPF_03.pdf Employers currently contribute 3 fewer percentage points of salaries over S$750 for employees up to 55 years old. Overview =Accounts and interest rates= Employees and employers are required to make monthly contributions to the following CPF accounts: * Ordinary Account (OA) ‚Äì for housing, pay for CPF insurance, investment and education. * Special Account (SA) ‚Äì for old age and investment in retirement-related financial products. * Medisave Account (MA) ‚Äì for hospitalisation and approved medical insurance. The OA and SA is combined to form the Retirement Account (RA) when one turns 55. The RA is used to meet basic needs during old age. The CPF savings earn a minimum interest of 2.5% for OA and 4% for other accounts. In addition, the first $60,000 in the combined CPF balances, with up to $20,000 from the Ordinary Account, will earn an extra 1% interest. =CPF contribution rates= As of 2018, the employer's CPF contribution is 17% for those up to age of 55 and decreases to 7.5% for those 65 and above. The employee's CPF contribution is 20% up to age 55, above 55 to 60 years of age 13%, above 60 to 65 to 7.5%, and decreases to 5% for those 65 and above. Retirement Schemes =CPF Minimum Sum= The CPF Minimum Sum (MS) Scheme requires all members to set aside a minimum sum of CPF savings in the RA for retirement needs upon reaching 55 years old. CPF savings from the OA and SA would be transferred to the RA for this purpose. Members whose savings are in excess of the MS and Medisave minimum sum would be allowed to withdraw them in cash. For members with insufficient savings in the RA, their property bought with their CPF savings will be automatically pledged to make up up to half of their MS. Members would receive a monthly stipend from their RA at the start of their draw down age until it is depleted. The MS has been continuously increased over the years to account for inflation and longer life expectancies. CPF members who turn 55 between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2015 will need to set aside a Minimum Sum of $155,000 in their Retirement Account and $40,500 in their Medisave Account. Over the years, the draw down age has been progressively delayed from 60 to 65. For the cohort who reached age 55 in 2016, only 53% of those who are active members met the Minimum Sum requirement, leaving 47% failing to do so. =CPF Life= Members with at least $40,000 in their Retirement Account at 55 or at least $60,000 at 65 years old will be asked to select a CPF LIFE annuity plan, which will give them an income for life, starting from their draw down age. Those who are not on CPF LIFE can choose to join it or continue to keep the monies in their Retirement Account. It improves upon the Minimum Sum Scheme where payouts only last about 20 years. No minimum amount of RA savings will be needed to join CPF LIFE, however the monthly payout depends on the RA savings. Thus, members with lower RA balances will receive correspondingly lower monthly payouts. Members who have a life annuity from an insurance company that provides equivalent benefits to that of CPF LIFE may be exempted from joining the scheme. Medical Schemes =Medisave= Medisave may be used to cover for self or dependents' hospitalisation expenses. It may also be used for certain outpatient treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. Since 1 January 2004, CPF members who turn 55 and are able to meet the CPF Minimum Sum are required to set aside the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS) in their MA when they make a CPF withdrawal. The MMS is set at $40,500 from 1 July 2013. OA and/or SA balances in excess of the Minimum Sum will be used to top up the MMS if it is insufficient. =Medishield Life= MediShield Life is a catastrophic medical insurance scheme to help one and their dependents to meet the high medical costs of prolonged or serious illnesses. Medisave savings may be used to cover the premiums for MediShield Life.https://www.moh.gov.sg/medishield- life/what-is-medishield-life =Medifund= Medifund helps the poor and needy to cover their medical bills. Protection Schemes =Eldershield= ElderShield is a severe disability insurance scheme that provides monthly cash payout of $300 or $400 up to a maximum period of 5 or 6 years. CPF members with a Medisave account will be automatically enrolled into the scheme once they reach 40 years old unless they opt-out. In order to make a claim under this scheme, a person must lose the ability to perform at least three out of the six daily activities: Washing, Dressing, Feeding, Toileting, Mobility, Transferring. As of 2018, depending on the payout, entry age and gender, the annual premium for Eldershield ranges from $152 to $3132. This premium is non- guaranteed and may be adjusted in the future. According to Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong, about $2.6 billion have been collected in premiums for ElderShield, out of which around $100 million have been paid out in claims and $130 million in premium rebates from its inception in 2002 to end 2015. According to Gan Kim Yong, ElderShield collects premiums while the policyholder is aged 40 to 65, and provides lifetime coverage from age 40, even after the policyholder reaches 65 and stops paying premiums. The total amount of premiums collected exceed the amount of claims paid to-date because the premiums collected are meant to provide coverage against future claims throughout policyholders' lifetime. Feb 2017.pdf =Careshield Life= On 25 May 2018, the Ministry of Health announced that it will be introducing a mandatory insurance scheme that will enhance the existing Eldershield by 2020 for those aged between 30 and 40. Similar to Eldershield, to claim under Careshield Life, one has to lose the ability to perform at least three out of six daily living activities. Careshield Life premium has a longer payment period of 38 years (variable depending on re-employment age cap) compared to 26 years for Eldershield and there is no way to opt out unlike Eldershield. The annual premium is also higher, starting at $200 for men joining at the age of 30 and $250 for women, with premium rising at 2% per annum initially. The monthly payout starts at $600 per month and last through a lifetime. =Dependents' Protection Scheme= The Dependents' Protection Scheme provides a maximum coverage of $46,000 for families to tide over the first few years in the event of an insured member's terminal illness, total permanent disability or death up to 60 years old. The annual premium increases with age, from $36 at 21 years old to $260 at 55 years old. Housing Schemes The Ordinary Account savings can be used to purchase a home under the CPF housing schemes. A Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat may be purchased under the Public Housing Scheme, or a private property under the Residential Properties Scheme. CPF savings may be used for full or partial payment of the property, and to service the monthly housing payments. Home buyers who are taking a bank loan to finance their property purchase have to pay the first 5% of the down payment in cash. If a flat is purchased under the Public Housing Scheme, mortgage insurance under the Home Protection Scheme will be necessary. Investment Scheme CPF members may invest their Ordinary Account balance under the CPF Investment Scheme ‚Äì Ordinary Account (CPFIS-OA) and their Special Account balance under the CPF Investment Scheme ‚Äì Special Account (CPFIS-SA), subject to caps. Assets that may be invested includes Insurance, unit trusts, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Fixed Deposits, Bonds and Treasury Bills, Shares, Property Fund and Gold. From 1 July 2010, only monies in excess of $20,000 in the Ordinary Account and $40,000 in the Special Account can be invested. CPF Withdrawal From 2003 to 2013, CPF members who left Singapore withdrew SGD$426 million, or 0.3 per cent of the average total members' balances each year. From 2013 to 2017, an annual average of 13,500 CPF members, or 0.4% of total CPF members, withdrew their CPF monies when they left Singapore. =Conditions for withdrawal= CPF savings can be withdrawn on the following grounds: * Malaysians who are at least 50 years old and residing in West Malaysia. * Anyone who has renounced his citizenship or PR and leaving Singapore and West Malaysia permanently. * Upon death. * Conditional partial withdrawal for those who are certified permanently unfit for work, such as physically or mentally incapacitated. Controversies =Comparison with City Harvest Church Fund= On 15 May 2014, Roy Ngerng made a post entitled \\"Where Your CPF Money Is Going: Learning From The City Harvest Trial\\" on his blog the Heart Truths. Within the post, Ngerng created a chart which mapped the relationships between the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Temasek Holdings and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC). Ngerng claimed there was an \\"uncanny resemblance\\" between this chart and another chart by news agency Channel News Asia regarding the relationship among City Harvest Church leaders, who were being charged with misappropriating funds. The CPF has been described as \\"a forced savings scheme\\" for Singaporeans with \\"monthly contributions into the fund\\" to be saved for retirement, or for expenses on \\"property, healthcare, and their children's education\\", while the GIC has been described to have \\"indirectly invested\\" funds from the CPF. Singapore's Ministry of Finance on its part has put forth its explanation as to why CPF funds are invested in Special Singapore Government Securities, to enable CPF Board to be able to pay its members all their monies when due, and the interest that it commits to pay on CPF accounts. The government securities are invested as part of a combined pool of funds managed by GIC, rather than managed in a separate dedicated fund, as a standalone fund would have to be managed conservatively to avoid the risk of failing to meet obligations to CPF members. On 18 May, Prime Minister (PM) Lee responded through his lawyer Davinder Singh, who stated that the blog post alleged that Lee \\"is guilty of criminal misappropriation of the monies paid by Singaporeans to the CPF\\" and that the allegations were \\"false and baseless\\". Ngerng said that the article was a call for greater transparency on the CPF, the GIC and Temasek Holdings. and called for PM Lee to rebut the points made in his blog post. Singapore's Ministry of Finance has publicly stated that CPF monies are safe as all CPF monies are invested in securities that are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government, which is one of the few remaining triple-A credit-rated governments in the world. Ngerng apologized \\"unreservedly\\" on 23 May, admitting that his allegation was \\"false and completely without foundation\\". On 29 May 2014, Prime Minister Lee filed a defamation lawsuit against Ngerng. In a 4 August affidavit, Ngerng argued that his blog post had been misunderstood, and that he was merely asking for more transparency and accountability for CPF monies. On 7 November 2014, the High Court of Singapore found Ngerng liable of defamation with damages to be assessed, which was the first such ruling in Singapore over a purely online article. Judge Lee Seiu Kin ruled that there was \\"no triable defence\\" and \\"no doubt that it is defamatory to suggest that the plaintiff is guilty of criminal misappropriation\\". An injunction against Ngerng was granted, barring him from publishing future similar accusations regarding PM Lee and the CPF. Ngerng expressed disappointment at the verdict, but maintained that he would \\"still continue to speak up on the CPF and other issues that concern Singaporeans\\". On 17 December 2015 the court led by Lee Seiu Kin handed down a judgement ordering Ngerng to pay S$100,000 in general damages and S$50,000 in aggravated damages. Ngerng, through his lawyer, Eugene Thuraisingam proposed to pay the S$150,000 in instalments which was granted by the Prime Minister on the condition that Ngerng paid the S$30,000 in hearing costs immediately i.e. by 16 March 2016. Ngerng is expected to repay $100 a month from 1 April 2016 onwards over five years until 1 April 2021 when instalments are increased to S$1,000 until the full sum has been paid by the year 2033. Lee also rejected Ngerng's request to reimburse part of the damages i.e. S$36,000.

It provides website authoring, collaboration, and administration tools that help users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup languages create and manage website content. A WCMS provides the foundation for collaboration, providing users the ability to manage documents and output for multiple author editing and participation. Most systems use a content repository or a database to store page content, metadata, and other information assets the system needs. A presentation layer (template engine) displays the content to website visitors based on a set of templates, which are sometimes XSLT files. Most systems use server side caching to improve performance. This works best when the WCMS is not changed often but visits happen frequently. Administration is also typically done through browser-based interfaces, but some systems require the use of a fat client. Capabilities A web content management system controls a dynamic collection of web material, including HTML documents, images, and other forms of media. A WCMS facilitates document control, auditing, editing, and timeline management. A WCMS typically has the following features: ;Automated templates: Create standard templates (usually HTML and XML) that users can apply to new and existing content, changing the appearance of all content from one central place. ;Access control: Some WCMS systems support user groups, which control how registered users interact with the site. A page on the site can be restricted to one or more groups. This means an anonymous user (someone not logged on), or a logged on user who is not a member of the group a page is restricted to, is denied access. ;Scalable expansion: Available in most modern WCMSs is the ability to expand a single implementation (one installation on one server) across multiple domains, depending on the server's settings. WCMS sites may be able to create microsites/web portals within a main site as well. ;Easily editable content: Once content is separated from the visual presentation of a site, it usually becomes much easier and quicker to edit and manipulate. Most WCMS software includes WYSIWYG editing tools allowing non-technical users to create and edit content. ;Scalable feature sets: Most WCMS software includes plug-ins or modules that can be easily installed to extend an existing site's functionality. ;Web standards upgrades: Active WCMS software usually receives regular updates that include new feature sets and keep the system up to current web standards. ;Workflow management: Workflow management is the process of creating cycles of sequential and parallel tasks that must be accomplished in the WCMS. For example, one or many content creators can submit a story, but it is not published until the copy editor cleans it up and the editor-in-chief approves it. ;Collaboration: WCMS software may act as a collaboration platform where many users retrieve and work on content. Changes can be tracked and authorized for publication or ignored reverting to old versions. Other advanced forms of collaboration allow multiple users to modify (or comment) a page at the same time in a collaboration session. ;Delegation: Some WCMS software allows for various user groups to have limited privileges over specific content on the website, spreading out the responsibility of content management. ;Document management: WCMS software may provide a means of collaboratively managing the life cycle of a document from initial creation time, through revisions, publication, archive, and document destruction. ;Content virtualization: WCMS software may provide a means of allowing each user to work within a virtual copy of the entire web site, document set, and/or code base. This enables viewing changes to multiple interdependent resources in context prior to submission. ;Content syndication: WCMS software often helps distribute content by generating RSS and Atom data feeds to other systems. They may also e-mail users when updates become available. ;Multilingual: Many WCMSs can display content in multiple languages. ;Versioning: Like document management systems, WCMS software may implement version control, by which users check pages in and out of the WCMS. Authorized editors can retrieve previous versions and work from a selected point. Versioning is useful for content that changes and requires updating, but it may be necessary to start from or reference a previous version.  Types  A WCMS can use one of three approaches: offline processing, online processing, and hybrid processing. These terms describe the deployment pattern for the WCMS in terms of when it applies presentation templates to render web pages from structured content. =Offline processing= These systems, sometimes referred to as \\"static site generators\\", pre-process all content, applying templates before publication to generate web pages. Since pre-processing systems do not require a server to apply the templates at request time, they may also exist purely as design-time tools. =Online processing= These systems apply templates on-demand. They may generate HTML when a user visits the page, or the user might receive pre-generated HTML from a web cache. Most open source WCMSs support add-ons that extended the system's capabilities. These include features like forums, blogs, wikis, web stores, photo galleries, and contact management. These are variously called modules, nodes, widgets, add-ons, or extensions. =Hybrid processing= Some systems combine the offline and online approaches. Some systems write out executable code (e.g., JSP, ASP, PHP, ColdFusion, or Perl pages) rather than just static HTML. That way, personnel don't have to deploy the WCMS itself on every web server. Other hybrids operate in either an online or offline mode. Advantages ;Low cost: Some content management systems are free, such as Drupal, eZ Publish, TYPO3, Joomla, Zesty.io, and WordPress. Others may be affordable based on size subscriptions. Although subscriptions can be expensive, overall the cost of not having to hire full-time developers can lower the total costs. Plus software can be bought based on need for many WCMSs. ;Easy customization: A universal layout is created, making pages have a similar theme and design without much code. Many WCMS tools use a drag and drop AJAX system for their design modes. It makes it easy for beginner users to create custom front-ends. ;Easy to use: WCMSs accommodate non-technical people. Simplicity in design of the admin UI lets website content managers and other users update content without much training in coding or system maintenance. ;Workflow management: WCMSs provide the facility to control how content is published, when it is published, and who publishes it. Some WCMSs allow administrators to set up rules for workflow management, guiding content managers through a series of steps required for each of their tasks. ;Good For SEO: WCMS websites also accommodate search engine optimization (SEO). Content freshness helps, as some search engines prefer websites with newer content. Social media plugins help build a community around content. RSS feeds automatically generated by blogs, or WCMS websites can increase the number of subscribers and readers to a site. URL rewriting can be implemented easily‚Äîclean URLs without parameters further help in SEO. Some plugins specifically help with website SEO. Disadvantages ;Cost of implementations: Larger scale implementations may require training, planning, and certifications. Certain WCMSs may require hardware installation. Commitment to the software is required on bigger investments. Commitment to training, developing, and upkeep are costs incurred in any enterprise system. ;Cost of maintenance: Maintaining WCMSs may require license updates, upgrades, and hardware maintenance. ;Latency issues: Larger WCMSs can experience latency if hardware infrastructure is not up to date, databases are used incorrectly, or web cache files that reload every time data updates grow too large. Load balancing issues may also impair caching files. ;Tool mixing: Because the URLs of many WCMSs are dynamically generated with internal parameters and reference information, they are often not stable enough for static pages and other web tools, particularly search engines, to rely on them. ;Security: WCMS's are often forgotten about when hardware, software, and operating systems are patched for security threats. Due to lack of patching by the user, a hacker can use unpatched WCMS software to exploit vulnerabilities to enter an otherwise secure environment. WCMS's should be part of an overall, holistic security patch management program to maintain the highest possible security standards.

He held high office at the beginning of the reign of his brother-in-law, King James II. Early life He was the eldest son of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, and his second wife, Frances Aylesbury. He was thus a brother of Anne Hyde, and maternal uncle to both Queen Mary II and Queen Anne. Both he and his brother Laurence Hyde were brought up partly at Antwerp and Breda, by their mother. Clarendon before 1660 made use of Henry as copyist, decipherer, and confidential secretary, in his correspondence with distant royalists. Under Charles II Swallowfield Park house Soon after the return of his family to England, in 1660, Hyde married Theodosia Capell, daughter of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and Elizabeth Morrison, and sister of Mary Capell, Duchess of Beaufort. She died in 1661, and in 1670, he married secondly to Flower Backhouse, daughter of William Backhouse and Anne Richards, and widow of William Bishop and Sir William Backhouse (kinsman of her father), gaining the manor and house of Swallowfield Park, Berkshire, where he rebuilt the house. Later she was First Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne of Great Britain. Queen Anne later took a dislike to her aunt, no doubt influenced by her best friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough; Sarah detested Flower, whom she called \\"the madwoman\\". Hyde had the courtesy title Lord Cornbury, from 1661. He was Member of Parliament for Wiltshire, until 1674. In 1662 he was appointed private secretary to Queen Catherine of Braganza, whose lord chamberlain he became in July 1665; in later years he may have regretted the appointment, as he and the Queen became embroiled in an almost interminable lawsuit over the arrears of her allowance. John Evelyn in 1664 helped him to plant Cornbury Park. He spoke on behalf of his father on his impeachment in 1667; and after his fall Lord Cornbury became an opponent of the court party and the Cabal Ministry, and attacked Buckingham and Arlington. On his father's death in 1674 he succeeded to the earldom of Clarendon. In 1680, the influence of his brother-in-law James, Duke of York, made him a privy councillor. Around the same time he was named keeper of Denmark House and treasurer and receiver-general of the queen's revenues. At this time, and often, he had money troubles. The friendship of the Duke of York led to his inclusion with his brother Lawrence in the group whom the Commons early in January 1681 told the king were persons inclined to popery. By now a court loyalist, he was in a position to visit in the Tower of London both Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex (brother to his first wife), in 1683, and in the next reign the Duke of Monmouth, and to plead the cause of Alice Lisle when she had been sentenced by Judge George Jeffreys. Under James II In 1685, Henry's brother-in-law, King James II, appointed him Lord Privy Seal. A few months later, the office was put into commission, and he was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. =In Ireland= Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, had been summoned to London from the command of the military forces in Ireland about the date when Clarendon set out for Dublin (December 1685). On 9 January 1686 the new Lord-Lieutenant arrived in Dublin. He found his authority overshadowed by that of the absent commander-in-chief. Shortly Clarendon was told by Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland of the king's intention to introduce Roman Catholics into the Irish judicial and administrative system, as well as into the Irish Army. Clarendon warned bishops and preachers against offending Catholic feeling, and admitted Catholics as councillors and as officers of the army; and he urged their admission into town corporations. He made half-hearted protests to the king. In June 1686 Tyrconnel returned with full powers as commander-in-chief; Clarendon clung to his office. Tyrconnell transformed the army; and in August 1686 he visited England to obtain the king's permission for legislation to replace the Act of Settlement 1662. Clarendon sent many protests to both king and queen during his rival's absence; but as his brother Lawrence (now Earl of Rochester) saw his influence dwindle, he came to the conclusion that no hope of retaining his post in Ireland remained except through the queen. About three weeks after the dismissal of Rochester (8 January 1687), he received his letter of recall from Sunderland. Tyrconnell, who took Clarendon's place had a final interview with him on 8 February. On 21 February Clarendon landed at Neston in Cheshire, carrying with him the account books of the stores. =Loss of office= Henry and his brother, the Earl of Rochester, had fallen from the king's favour and were dismissed from office. The Privy Seal was given on 16 March 1687 to a Catholic, Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour, and Clarendon withdrew for a while into private life. He had a marriage project of his eldest son, now Lord Cornbury, and money to raise for a settlement on the encumbered family estates. He engaged in speculations, ranging from the digging for coal in Windsor forest to the traffic of Scotch pedlars. A pension was conferred on him by James II about the beginning of 1688. He advised the bishops in the Tower of London concerning their bail, and was asked by Jeffreys to use his good offices with William Sancroft. The Queen, on whose council he had been placed in 1681, sought him out. On 24 September 1688, the day after her friendly reception of him, Clarendon found the king himself, in view of the Dutch preparations for invasion, anxious to 'see what the Church of England men will do.' He became more resolute, and on 22 October, at the council summoned by the king to hear his declaration concerning the birth of the Prince of Wales, declined to sit by the side of Father Edward Petre, and asked to attend as a peer only. Nine days after the landing of William of Orange Lord Cornbury deserted from the King to him (14 November), a turning point; and very difficult for Clarendon. (Mary, wife of William, was Henry's niece.) In the council of peers called by the King on his return to discuss the question of summoning a free parliament (27 November) Clarendon argued against the royal policy; and on 1 December he set out for Salisbury to make his peace with William. On 3 December he had an interview with William at Berwick, near Hindon, Wiltshire, and offered him his support. He was present at the Hungerford conference on 8 December, and followed the advance of the prince as far as Henley, where, on 13 December he obtained leave of absence. By the prince's desire he waited on him again at Windsor on 16 December, and presented to him his brother Rochester. It was at the conference held at Windsor that Clarendon was said to have suggested the confinement of King James to the Tower; while, according to Gilbert Burnet he proposed his relegation to Breda. He himself declared that, except at the Windsor meeting, he had never been present at any discussion about what should be done with King James, but that he was against the king being sent away. He was informed by William himself that the King had fled. Jacobite Clarendon took a Tory line, rejecting the Whig assumption that King James had abdicated, and the settlement of the crown upon William III and Mary II. He spoke to this effect in parliament, and he refused to take the oaths to the new government. William took it badly that Clarendon had represented him as hostile to the Church of England. Clarendon was in touch with Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston, a Jacobite plotter. On 24 June, Queen Mary II ordered her uncle arrested, and next day he was in the Tower of London. There he stayed, not specially well treated though he was allowed the company of his wife for a time, until 15 August. After his liberation, the plotting resumed. When Lord Preston on 31 December 1690 was arrested on the Thames River, the letters found upon him included one from Clarendon to King James. Preston named Clarendon among his accomplices; Clarendon, who from 4 January 1691, after being examined before the cabinet council, had been once more consigned to the Tower, remained there for several months. In July he was allowed into the country under care of his warder; and his release on bail soon followed. Later life The remainder of Clarendon's life was passed in tranquillity at his residences in the country, troubled only by his almost endless lawsuit with the Dowager Queen Catherine. Cornbury was in 1694, owing to money difficulties, denuded of many of the pictures collected by his father, and of at least a great part of its library; and in 1697, or shortly before, was sold by Clarendon to Rochester, though to spare his pride the sale was kept a secret till his death. The publication (1702‚Äì1704) of the first edition, in three volumes, of the History of the Rebellion by the first Earl, was mostly the work of Rochester; but Clarendon took an interest, and in 1704 he presented John Evelyn with the three printed volumes. Queen Anne would not receive him at Court, as a \\"diehard\\" Jacobite, but she did pay him a pension. Clarendon died on 31 October 1709. His Diary (1687-1690) and Correspondence, with the letters of his younger brother Rochester, first appeared in 1828; it was edited by Samuel Weller Singer from manuscripts of William Upcott. He had a fine collection of medals, and was author of the History and Antiquities of the Cathedral Church at Winchester, continued by Samuel Gale, London, 1715.

It was released in Japan in 1983 for the Family Computer, in North America in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and in 1986 in the PAL region. It is the only game in the Education Series of NES games in North America, owing to the game's lack of success. It was made available in various forms, including in the 2002 GameCube video game Animal Crossing and on the Virtual Console services for Wii and Wii U in 2007 and 2014 respectively. Donkey Kong Jr. Math was a critical and commercial failure. It has received criticism from several publications including IGN staff, who called it one of the worst Virtual Console games. Gameplay Gameplay of the two-player mode The game features two modes, one single-player and the allowing for one to two players. Its mechanics are similar to its predecessor, Donkey Kong Jr. The Calculate mode has Donkey Kong hold up a number, which players must attempt to reach by collecting a combination of digits and arithmetic symbols to eventually reach that number. Players must climb vines to reach these figures. The +-X% Exercise requires players to solve fixed math puzzles by climbing chains to reach the correct numbers and arithmetic symbols to do so.  Development  Donkey Kong Jr. Math was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 2 and designed by Toshihiko Nakago. It was published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Family Computer (Famicom). It reuses its engine, assets, and gameplay from Donkey Kong Jr. It was a part of the Educational Series on the NES, a series that was originally supposed to have three entries, including a Donkey Kong music game. However, it was the only one released under that line. A lack of success by the game was attributed by a Nintendo spokesman to be the reason Nintendo did not make more educational titles. It was the first spin-off title Nintendo made. The game was first released in Japan on December 12, 1983, and was released shortly after together with Donkey Kong Jr. as a licensed multicart (released in a bundle together with Sharp's C1 NES TV).NEWSCLUB Premium Goods „Éó„É¨„Éü„Ç¢„É† „Ç∞„ÉÉ„Ç∫ - „Éó„É¨„Éü„Ç¢‰ªò„ÄÅ„Å£„Å¶„Å†„Åë„ÅßËààÂë≥„ÅÇ„Çã„Åß„Åó„Çá? : Èáë„Åß„ÅØÂ£≤„Çå„ÇìËá™ÊÖ¢„ÅÆ‰∏ÄÂìÅ.

In August 1995, the Sharp multicart was re-released separately from the C1 NES TV. The game has been released on other platforms, including the video game Animal Crossing, which featured several NES games. Donkey Kong Jr. Math was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on March 27, 2007, Europe and Australia on April 20, 2007, and in North America on September 3, 2007. It was re-released again for the Wii U's Virtual Console in North America on August 28, 2014, in Europe on January 22, 2015, and in Japan on April 15, 2015. Reception Donkey Kong Jr. Math was met with negative reviews from the press. Despite this negative reception, the magazine Joystick felt Nintendo was worthy of praise for its attempt at making an educational game. It was also a commercial failure, with a Nintendo spokesperson noting its lack of success as being due to poor reception. It performed better in Japan but was forgotten in the United States. Its poor sales contributed to it becoming a rare and expensive collector's item. Jeremy Parish of Polygon called it the worst Donkey Kong video game, suggesting that it was a \\"half-finished game\\" to have a larger launch lineup on the Famicom. He was also critical of its asset reuse from Donkey Kong Jr., while Skyler Miller of Allgame found this reuse creative. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it the worst NES launch window title, criticizing it for its lack of value and sluggish movement. It had a poor reception from IGN, with Lucas M. Thomas finding its controls and execution poor, while Cam Shea regarded it as one of the worst Virtual Console games and criticized it for a lack of value. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer similarly could not justify the asking price for the Virtual Console version. Frank Provo of GameSpot felt that its math problems were either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life criticized the game for \\"shoehorning\\" education into this game and for poor controls. Donkey Kong Jr. Math has received criticism for its qualities as an educational game. Elizabeth Sweedyk, associate computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College, felt that Donkey Kong Jr. Math was too realistic an educational game to be fun. Kevin Gifford of 1UP.com felt that it lacks appeal for children, while Frank Caron for Ars Technica felt it inferior to other educational games like Brain Age and Math Blaster.

The episode's plot follows Mac, an eight- year-old boy who is pressured by his mother to abandon his imaginary friend Blooregard Q. Kazoo, on the grounds that he is too old for him. Upon seeing an ad on television for an orphanage for imaginary friends, Bloo convinces Mac to let him reside in the house so then Mac can visit him everyday. Various intrigues and troubles arise with Mac's brother Terrence and imaginary friend Duchess. It premiered on August 13, 2004, at 7:30 pm E/P on Cartoon Network as a 90-minute movie. The episode was written and directed by the show's creator Craig McCracken, with further story work by his then-fianc√©e Lauren Faust and screenwriters Craig Lewis and Amy Keating Rogers. The episode debuted to positive reviews and high ratings. Plot Eight-year-old Mac and his imaginary friend Blooregard Q. Kazoo (or \\"Bloo\\" for short) often get into fights with his 13-year-old brother Terrence. When Mac's mother tires of this behavior, she tells him that he has outgrown his age to have an imaginary friend and must get rid of him. Crushed by overhearing their argument, except for Terrence, who is rather pleased, Bloo later comes across a TV commercial for \\"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\\"\\"where good ideas are not forgotten,\\" according to the motto. The next day, Mac and Bloo stop in at the sprawling mansion and are met by Mr. Herriman, the strict business manager. After Bloo explains the situation in comically exaggerated detail, they are given a tour of the house. Frankie, the caregiver, is about to show Mac and Bloo around; however, she is soon called away by the ill-tempered, high- maintenance resident Duchess. Basketball-loving Wilt takes over the tour and introduces Mac and Bloo to the wide variety of imaginary friends that live in the house. Along the way, they meet Coco, who lays plastic eggs when she gets excited and only says \\"Coco\\" when she speaks, and the fearsome-looking but soft-hearted Eduardo. Mac and Bloo both think Foster's will be a good place for Bloo to live. However, Frankie tells them that if he stays there, he will be eligible for adoption whenever Mac is not around. Mac promises to stop by after school and departs, taking Coco's eggs with him, leaving Bloo alone with his new housemates who show him their bedroom where he will be sleeping at. Seeing Bloo about sleep on the floor, Wilt lets him take his bunk in exchange for sleeping on the floor and they all fall asleep for the night. The next day, a wealthy rich couple stops by Foster's to find a friend for their spoiled daughter. They only want the best for her, and Frankie sees a perfect chance to get Duchess out of the house for good. The married couple agrees. Just as Mr. Herriman is getting ready to do the paperwork for the adoption, though, their daughter catches sight of Bloo and starts chasing him. Wilt, Coco, and Eduardo race all over the house to keep Bloo out of reach, but the married couple's daughter finally snatches him away and shows him to her mom and father. They agree, but only Mac's last-minute arrival saves him. The millionaires leave empty-handed, while Duchess becomes even angrier at not being able to leave Foster's, which she refers to as a dump, due to Bloo's interference. Terrence, meanwhile, has been watching from behind the bushes across the street and realizes that Mac has not gotten rid of Bloo. He and Duchess join forces to do away with their common enemy. As Mac is on his way to Foster's the next day, Terrence keeps him from reaching Foster's, carries him back home, and locks him in the bedroom closet. Terrence then pays a visit of his own, dressed to make a good impression. Duchess creates a diversion by provoking one of the Extremeasauruses (dangerous monster friends created by teenagers), leaving Bloo alone with Terrence. Mac finds Coco's eggs in the closet and gets some tools from them needed to make his escape. He is too late to stop the adoption from going through, but he and the others soon realize that Terrence and Duchess are working together. That evening, Terrence takes Bloo to a junkyard and meets Duchess, who plans to feed Bloo to an Extremeasaurus she freed earlier as revenge for foiling her chance of being adopted. They are foiled by the arrival of Mac and company, who manage to save Bloo and trick the monster into turning on its masters. Once everyone is back at Foster's, Mac and Bloo are surprised by the arrival of its founder, Madame Foster herself. She announces that Bloo can live there permanently and never be put up for adoption, as long as Mac visits him every day after school, although Mr. Herriman is not happy with this as it defies the house rules, but Foster dismisses this. As for Duchess, her punishment is to be forced to stay at Foster's, the place she hates so much, while Terrence finds himself at the mercy of a herd of annoyed pegasi, whom he had taunted earlier during the junkyard fight. Production Craig McCracken created the series and the episode, serving as writer and director. McCracken conceived the series upon adopting two dogs from an animal shelter with his then-fianc√©e Lauren Faust; he wondered what their life was like before adoption and applied the concept to that of imaginary friends. Animation for the show was done on Adobe Flash after hand-drawn artwork was processed on Illustrator. Character composition was done on After Effects. Reception Anita Gates of The New York Times praised the episode and stated that the series would promise to be an \\"admirable tale of loyalty and adventure-based learning with a contagious sense of fun\\". =Awards= McCracken and Mike Moon won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation in 2005 for their work in the episode. The show also received an Annie Award nomination for Best Character Design in an Animated Television Production.

It is a sometimes derogatory, sometimes lighthearted term that is used to describe Orange County's more conservative and suburban population as compared to the more liberal and urban population of Los Angeles.http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/orange_curtain/ The phrase is a wordplay on the so-called Iron Curtain, which separated communist and capitalist Europe. According to Colleen Cotter, \\"Because [Orange County] has a reputation for political conservatism, people from Northern California especially worry about what happens 'Behind the Orange Curtain'.\\" The Orange Curtain began from the fact that between 1890 and 1950, Orange County was wholly white and \\"the region's predominately Irish settling also embraced an ideology of small government. Following the 2018 midterm elections, in which liberal Democrats were elected to all seven congressional seats in Orange County, comments arose about the so-called collapse of the Orange Curtain. A Republican Party political consultant said, \\"Orange County was different. It was, as we called it, 'the orange curtain' and it has now fallen.\\" References Geography of Southern California Orange County, California ","title":"Orange Curtain"},{"id":"1853888","text":"The King's Indian Attack (or KIA), also known as the Barcza System (after Gedeon Barcza), is a chess opening system for White. The opening is not a series of specific moves, but rather a ' that can be played from many different move orders. Though the KIA is often reached via 1.e4 followed by d3, Nd2 (or Qe2), Ngf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, it can also arise from 1.g3, 1.Nf3, or even 1.d3. Characteristics The KIA is a mirror image of the setup adopted by Black in the King's Indian Defence. Yet, because of White's extra tempo, the nature of the subsequent play is often different from that of a typical King's Indian Defence. By its nature, the KIA is a closed, strategic opening that presents its practitioner with common themes and tactics and a comfortable middlegame against various defences. White's most common plan involves a central pawn push, e4‚Äìe5, leading to a central bind, , and concrete attacking chances on a kingside-castled black king. Black's resources‚Äîmore space for example‚Äîare not to be underestimated. In fact, this asymmetry often leads to violent middlegames and neatly constructed mating nets involving sacrifices. Piece manoeuvre The KIA is characterised by a fianchetto and developing its knights to d2 and f3 respectively. White also maintains king safety by castling kingside. White also has a good control of the . Use The KIA is often used against the semi-open defences where Black responds asymmetrically to e4, such as in the French Defence, Sicilian Defence, or Caro‚ÄìKann Defence. Yet it can also be played against Black's more common defenses, usually through a move order that begins with 1.Nf3 and a later fianchetto of the white-square bishop. For this reason, transpositions to the R√©ti Opening, Catalan Opening, English opening or even the Nimzo-Larsen Attack (after b3 and Bb2) are not uncommon. The KIA is considered a solid opening choice for White, although less ambitious than many more popular openings. Though rarely used at the highest levels except to avoid certain pet lines, it is extremely popular at the club level, because it is easier to learn than other openings that require memorising specific move orders to avoid bad positions. Barcza System King's Indian Attack (A07) is 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 (see diagram). Common Black responses are 2...Nf6, 2...c6, 2...Bg4, 2...c5, and 2...g6. Then White can play 3.Bg2. King's Indian Attack (A08) is 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2. 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Bg4 3.Bg2 Nd7 is the Keres Variation. =Transposition from other lines= 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 d5 1.Nf3 c5 2.g3 d5 =Transposition to other lines= 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.d4 (D02) Famous games The following games are perhaps the most famous examples of the KIA. * Fischer‚ÄìMyagmarsuren, Sousse Interzonal 1967 1.e4 e6 2.d3 d5 3.Nd2 Nf6 4.g3 c5 5.Bg2 Nc6 6.Ngf3 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.e5 Nd7 9.Re1 b5 10.Nf1 b4 11.h4 a5 12.Bf4 a4 13.a3 bxa3 14.bxa3 Na5 15.Ne3 Ba6 16.Bh3 d4 17.Nf1 Nb6 18.Ng5 Nd5 19.Bd2 Bxg5 20.Bxg5 Qd7 21.Qh5 Rfc8 22.Nd2 Nc3 23.Bf6 Qe8 24.Ne4 g6 25.Qg5 Nxe4 26.Rxe4 c4 27.h5 cxd3 28.Rh4 Ra7 29.Bg2 dxc2 30.Qh6 Qf8 31.Qxh7+ 1‚Äì0 * R√©ti‚ÄìRubinstein, Karlsbad 1923 1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.c4 d4 5.d3 Bg7 6.b4 0-0 7.Nbd2 c5 8.Nb3 cxb4 9.Bb2 Nc6 10.Nbxd4 Nxd4 11.Bxd4 b6 12.a3 Bb7 13.Bb2 bxa3 14.Rxa3 Qc7 15.Qa1 Ne8 16.Bxg7 Nxg7 17.0-0 Ne6 18.Rb1 Bc6 19.d4 Be4 20.Rd1 a5 21.d5 Nc5 22.Nd4 Bxg2 23.Kxg2 Rfd8 24.Nc6 Rd6 25.Re3 Re8 26.Qe5 f6 27.Qb2 e5 28.Qb5 Kf7 29.Rb1 Nd7 30.f3 Rc8 31.Rd3 e4 32.fxe4 Ne5 33.Qxb6 Nxc6 34.c5 Rd7 35.dxc6 Rxd3 36.Qxc7+ Rxc7 37.exd3 Rxc6 38.Rb7+ Ke8 39.d4 Ra6 40.Rb6 Ra8 41.Rxf6 a4 42.Rf2 a3 43.Ra2 Kd7 44.d5 g5 45.Kf3 Ra4 46.Ke3 h5 47.h4 gxh4 48.gxh4 Ke7 49.Kf4 Kd7 50.Kf5 1‚Äì0Richard Reti vs Akiba Rubinstein (1923) \\"Reti to Roll\\" * Another example is Garry Kasparov‚ÄìDeep Blue, 1997 match, game 5.

The population in 2011 was 13,046,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 1499.87 km2.  History  Historical boat along the Sado River in the town of Alc√°cer do Sal Santa Maria do Castelo, in the city square of Alc√°cer = Earliest settlement = There has been human settlement in the area for more than 40,000 years; archaeological investigations have placed human presence here back to the Mesolithic Period, when the first peoples began to concentrate in the areas around Alc√°cer. This period was characterized by exploitation of the ecosystem in the Sado Estuary, when the river extended to S√£o Rom√£o, involving fishing, scavenging for shellfish, hunting and foraging in the local forests. The primitive tools, made from chert, were adapted from the techniques of the late Paleolithic era. By the late Mesolithic period, people had concentrated in the area of Comporta and Torr√£o, later establishing primitive defensive protection to support its communities. These principal settlements were abandoned by the Copper Age, but repopulated during the Iron Age, as was the case of Alc√°cer. Mediterranean trade, pioneered by the Phoenicians, introduced commercial colonies in Abul and Alc√°cer (then referred to as Bevipo or Keition), where a written alphabet and currency allowed commerce to flourish. = Roman Era = After the Third Punic War, with the fall of Carthage, Alc√°cer was annexed to the Roman Empire (around 1st-2nd century B.C.). The municipality of present Alc√°cer became known as Urbs Imperatoria Salacia in honor of the sea god Neptune's wife, nymph Salacia, for its importance in the Iberian salt trade and the number of routes that crossed the area. Salatia suffered many of the problems that developed from the Roman urbes localized between Atlantic routes and Romanized northern Europe, and was made incrementally worse by Emperor Claudius's initiatives into England and Wales. These problems changed during the 3rd Century, when the port of Salatia was devalued, in favor of Olisipo (Lisbon). With the rise of Gaul, most of Hispania became a vassal state of the larger empire. Returning to the Imperial fold with the 296AD reorganization of Roman territories by Diocletian (in order to subvert the Military Anarchy that existed at the time), Salatia's role was transformed. Circa 300? it was the seat of a Diocese of Sal√°cia (Portuguese) / Salacien(sis) (Latin) / Salarien(sis) (Latin), which was however suppressed around 350.http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/sala1.htm GCatholic In the following centuries, Salatia became a poor distant colony of the much larger centers of Set√∫bal or Lisbon. The only exception was Torr√£o, which continued to prosper. Until 711, when the region was annexed by the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus, the population of the hilltop areas of Salatia left in favor of the low lands along the river. = Al-Andalus = Qa≈ür Abƒ´ DƒÅnis or Al Qa≈ür ('), surmounting the town, was a Moorish citadel before the Reconquista The Ummayad rule on the Iberian Peninsula, in the reign of Abu-l-Khattar (743-745) over the region of Beja, which included Alc√°cer, was noted for the recruitment of troops, and for the rising power of Yemeni clans in southern Portugal. The entire region was later administered by Egyptian Arab troops, that selected Beja as their regional seat. Until 844, Alc√°cer functioned as center for the collection of taxes in the lower Sado valley: collected primarily from the Christians who chose to remain in the valley. The first Viking raids in this year forced a political reorganization, and Alc√°cer became an important outpost of Al-Andalus. After an internal victory over Muladi rebels in 888, the city was offered as reward to the Banu DƒÅnis clan, and its keep was renamed Qa≈ür Abƒ´ DƒÅnis (ŸÇÿµÿ± ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿØÿßŸÜÿ≥ ; ),Eleva√ß√£o da Vila de Alc√°cer do Sal √† categoria de Cidade Projecto de Lei n¬∫ 228/VII commonly known simply as Al Qa≈ür (). The village of Al Qa≈ür was the base for a large fleet and arsenal that was used during the Christian-Moorish Reconquista.Revista popular (16 December 1848), p.329 In 997 a Moorish fleet transported troops from Alc√°cer to Porto, to support Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir, that culminated in the destruction of the sanctuary of Santiago de Compostela.C√¢mara Municipal de Alc√°cer do Sal, (2007) It was then capital of the Al Qa≈ür Province, which by the 12th Century was a center of merchant traffic, supported by the opulent tastes of √âvora. Muhammad al-Idrisi noted that forestry, and in particular pine tree harvesting, was important during this period, as was cattle raising and major agricultural cultivation. During the Almoravid dynasty Al Qasr became the administrative regional seat of an area that extended along the Atlantic coast until Trujillo, C√°ceres. = Crusades and Reconquista = Records of the Norwegian Crusade, held from 1107 to 1110, in the aftermath of the First Crusade, and led by Norwegian king Sigurd I, include a reference to the Norwegians winning a battle in the town of Alkasse (which is possibly a reference to Al Qa≈ür) - where they killed such a large number of people that the town was said to have been left empty, and looted many treasures.Riley- Smith, 1986, p. 132 However, the Norwegians then sailed on to the Holy Land and the town - with whatever inhabitants survived - remained Muslim. During the Fifth Crusade, when Afonso II of Portugal had a truce with the Almohads, Sueiro Bishops of Lisbon and √âvora joined the Cistercian abbot of Alcoba√ßa, the commander of Palmela, the Templars, the Hospitallers, and magnates, in an attempt to persuade the crusaders to attack the Moors in Alc√°cer do Sal. The city of Alc√°cer had been lost since 1191 in the aftermath of the Third Crusade campaigns of Alvor and Silves. The keep in Alc√°cer was conquered for the first time by the Portuguese in 1160. In 1191, it returned to Arab hands under the direction of Ya¬¥qub al-Mansur, who transformed it into the military garrison of Garb al-Andalus.Villegas-Aristiz√°bal, Lucas, \\"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc√°cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\\" Al-Masaq 30:1 (2019), 57, doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573 According to De itinere frisonum the Frisian Crusaders refused to help on account of Innocent III prohibition to Bishop Souiro, and departed for the Holy Land, even after being provided food, expenses, and rousing oratories about the Almohads' annual demands for 100 Christians in tribute.Villegas-Aristiz√°bal, Lucas, \\"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc√°cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\\", 60-63, doi: https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573 Meanwhile, ships under the command of William I of Holland and Goerge of Weid arrived in Alc√°cer do Sal on 2 August 1217. They were joined by Portuguese sent to lay siege to the castle.Joseph F. O'Callaghan (2003), p.79 Muslim governors in Seville, C√≥rdoba, Ja√©n and Badajoz attempted to relieve the garrison but their reinforcements were defeated on 11 September.

O'Callaghan (2003) refers to the intervention of a \\"heavenly host of knights all clad in white\\" and visions of the \\"sign of the holy cross in the sky as a sign of [their] victory\\". Once the castle was taken, many of the northern Crusaders requested Pope Honorius III allow them to remain for a year \\"for the liberation of Hispania\\" and \\"the extirpation of the perfidious cult of the pagans\\". The victory in Alc√°cer do Sal also motivated Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, Sancho VII of Navarre, in addition to Iberian prelates and nobles, to break their truces with the Muslim leaders, in hopes that the northern Crusaders would continue their campaigns the following summer. But, the Pope granted only absolution from their vows to those who could not continue to the Holy Land, and the Crusaders left the Castle to the Portuguese and continued on to Acre.

The Order of Santiago dominated an area from Sesimbra until the Algarve, controlling the lower Sado, Alentejo Litoral and coast of Cape St. Vincent. At the end of the 13th century, the Order advanced to M√©rtola to support reconquest of the Algarve, but later retreated to Alc√°cer and remained there until 1482, when they returned to Palmela. Along with the Christians and the town's small population of Jews, the remaining Muslims in Al√°cer do Sal begin to occupy the low country along the river, and vacate the Castle. The Muslims, under the \\"King's protection\\" remained in the community. In 1495, Manuel I was acclaimed King by the residents of the village. = Slave trade = By the 16th century, the whole Sado Basin, where Alc√°cer do Sal is located, had experienced an important African immigration as a way to compensate for the demographic deficit that accompanied the Portuguese overseas expansion. Later, in the 18th century, a new wave of slaves was recruited to Alc√°cer do Sal to work the salt fields and cultivate rice, the two important economic activities in the region. A recent genetic study in 2010 found in Alcacer the highest frequencies (22%) of Sub-Saharan maternal lineages reported so far in Europe and, according to the authors, likely associated with the influx of African slaves between the 15th and 19th centuries.Cruz I, Lucas I, Rosendo MT. 2001.

He played college football at the University of Texas and was the first overall selection in the 1966 NFL draft. Early years Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Nobis played football at Thomas Jefferson High School, where he was an all-state offensive end and middle linebacker for the Mustangs. College years Nobis is one of college football's all-time greatest linebackers. In his tenure with the Texas Longhorns (1963‚Äì1965) he averaged nearly 20 tackles a game and, as the only sophomore starter, was an important participant on the Longhorns' 1963 national championship team, which defeated #2 Navy led by Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach in the Cotton Bowl. Nobis was also a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity at the university. Nobis was a two-time All-American and made the All-Southwest Conference team three times. As a junior in the 1965 Orange Bowl, he made one of the most famous tackles in the game's history. On fourth-and-inches, and clinging to a 21‚Äì17 lead, Nobis led his teammates to a game-saving halt of top-ranked Alabama‚Äôs QB Joe Namath. Nobis was an iron man, playing (and starting) on both defense and offense for his entire college career. Aside from being an All-American linebacker, he also played guard on the offensive side of the ball and was often the primary blocker on touchdown runs. Famed Texas head coach Darrell Royal called him \\"the finest two-way player I have ever seen.\\" A knee injury slowed him during the latter part of his senior season, but he still was able to perform at a high level and won a number of major individual awards including the Knute Rockne Award, best lineman, the Outland Trophy, best interior lineman, and the Maxwell Award for college football‚Äôs best player. Nobis also finished seventh in the Heisman voting to USC's Mike Garrett. He appeared on the covers of LIFE, Sports Illustrated and TIME magazines. NFL career In November 1965, Nobis became the first player drafted by the expansion Atlanta Falcons as well as the second linebacker to be chosen first overall when he was taken with the #1 pick in the 1966 NFL draft, held on November 27, 1965. The Houston Oilers also selected him in the AFL draft. This presented a dilemma and also sparked a debate that reached as far as outer space when astronaut Frank Borman, aboard Gemini 7, talked back to earth with the message, \\"tell Nobis to sign with Houston.\\" (Borman's sons were ball boys for the Oilers.) Nobis instead signed with Atlanta on December 14 and became the first member of the Atlanta Falcons, gaining the nickname \\"Mr. Falcon.\\" Tommy Nobis joined the Falcons for their inaugural season in 1966. That season, he won the league's NFL Rookie of the Year, was voted to the Pro Bowl and amassed 294 combined tackles which still stands today as the team's all-time single-season record, and is unofficially the most tackles ever credited to one player, in a season, in NFL history. In eleven professional seasons he led the Falcons in tackles nine times, went to five Pro Bowls (one in 1972 after two knee surgeries), was named All-Pro twice and was chosen for the NFL's \\"All-Decade Team\\" for the 1960s. Miami Dolphins great, running back Larry Csonka commented, \\"I'd rather play against Dick Butkus than Nobis,\\" and Falcons coach Norm Van Brocklin once pointed to Nobis' locker and proclaimed, \\"There's where our football team dresses.\\" Nobis is a member of the Atlanta Falcons' Ring of Honor and his #60 was the first number retired by the team. No other Falcons player has ever worn the number. In 2005, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's third HOVG class. Nobis enjoyed a successful NFL career that many believe is worthy of Pro Football Hall of Fame induction. Former NFL player and coach Dan Reeves, while head coach of the Falcons, remarked, \\"As a running back for eight seasons in the NFL, I certainly took my share of hits. Unfortunately I remember some of them, particularly the ones from Falcons linebacker Tommy Nobis. 'Mr. Falcon,' as he is known in this part of the country, should be considered a worthy candidate for the Hall of Fame.‚Äù Reeves based his assertion on the fact that while playing in Atlanta, prior to the days of mass media coverage, Nobis was overlooked because of the ‚ÄúFalcons lack of success during his tenure‚Äù. He states, ‚ÄúI played and coached on some great teams while I was with Dallas. Those teams consisted of Hall of Fame members like Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach and Tom Landry. I feel that Nobis' contributions on the field merit those of the Cowboys Hall of Fame players.‚Äù Atlanta Journal- Constitution columnist and Hall of Fame voter Furman Bisher wrote, \\"There isn't much more one can say about Tommy Nobis. In the glow of a winning team, where he would have been a star on the isolated camera, he would already have been residing in Canton. It's not a Falcons thing, it's a Nobis thing, and here is a man who lives up to all the ideals I would establish for admission to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\\" After the NFL Number 60 is also revered at Texas where it was offered only to the best of linebackers. All American Britt Hager wore #60 during his senior season, as did All American Brian Jones. In 2004, another Longhorn All-American linebacker, Derrick Johnson, decided to wear the jersey in his final collegiate home game to honor Nobis. The number has recently joined Earl Campbell's #20, Bobby Layne's #22, Ricky Williams' #34, Vince Young's #10 and Colt McCoy's #12 as UT's only retired numbers. Tommy Nobis was inducted into the Texas Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1976. He was named to Sports Illustrated ‚Äôs All-Century Team (1869‚Äì1969) and is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, the State of Texas Hall of Fame, the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame, and the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame. In May 2007, he was inducted as a charter member into the Thomas Jefferson High School Alumni Hall of Fame. Tommy Nobis retired from the Falcons after 40 years as a member of the organization, in the front office and on the field. Apart from football, Nobis was a co-founder and a Board of Directors member of the Tommy Nobis Center that began in 1976. The mission of the organization is to develop and provide job training, employment, and vocational support for youth and adults with disabilities and other barriers to employment. He won the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. award for his work with the Georgia Special Olympics and has been named the NFL Man of the Year. Tommy Nobis died on December 13, 2017 at home at age 74, with his wife by his side, after an extended illness. On January 28, 2019 researchers from Boston University confirmed that Nobis had the most severe form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

It is based on the television series of the same name (which ran from 1962‚Äì71) and features cameo appearances by Buddy Ebsen (the original Jed Clampett, in his final motion picture appearance, playing his other classic character, Detective Barnaby Jones), Dolly Parton, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. The film follows a poor hillbilly named Jed Clampett (Jim Varney), who becomes a billionaire when he accidentally discovers crude oil after missing his target while hunting. Plot  Jed Clampett (Jim Varney), a hillbilly of humble station from Arkansas, accidentally discovers oil on his land while shooting at a rabbit. Ozark Mountain Oil, interested in purchasing his land, offers him $1 billion for the property. Unsure of what to do, Jed consults his cousin, Pearl Bodine (Linda Carlson), during a family dinner. Pearl suggests that a change of scenery for Jed's daughter, Elly May (Erika Eleniak), would be a good thing. Pearl and Jethrine convince them to move to Beverly Hills California. Ozark Mountain Oil come by Jed's place to check to see if he has signed the contract. Having made up his mind and signed the contract, Jed and his daughter, his mother-in-law Granny (Cloris Leachman), and his nephew, Jethro (Diedrich Bader), Pearl's son, load up Jethro's old, dilapidated truck with their possessions and move to Beverly Hills, California, even though Granny is reluctant to come. Milburn Drysdale (Dabney Coleman), the CEO of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills (where Jed's money is stored), sends out his secretary/assistant, Jane Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) to meet the Clampetts at their new estate that is next door to his. Jane calls the Beverly Hills Police after the Clampetts arrive, mistaking them for burglars. Upon learning of Jane's mistake at the police station, Drysdale briefly fires her. But seeing that Jed insists that he still wants her to watch over his affairs, Drysdale rehires her. The Clampetts settle into their new surroundings. Drysdale pushes his reluctant son, Morgan Drysdale (Kevin Connolly), into befriending Elly May, to whom he eventually develops an attraction. Jane is also smitten by Jethro, who seems ignorant of her affections. Jed requests Jane's assistance in helping him search for someone who will help turn Elly May into a lady and also wants to get married. So Miss Hathaway has to play matchmaker. Woodrow Tyler (Rob Schneider), a banker at Drysdale's bank, catches wind of this and contrives a scheme with his con artist girlfriend, Laura Jackson (Lea Thompson), to steal Jed's money by having her marry Jed. She poses as a French etiquette teacher, Laurette Voleur,Voleur is French for thief, per the Collins French to English Dictionary. Copyright ¬© by HarperCollins Publishers. All rights reserved. (Retrieved 2018-09-06.) and asks for work. 'Laurette' feigns romantic interest in Jed, which eventually leads to him proposing marriage to her. Shortly before the wedding, Granny hears Laura and Woodrow talking about the scam. Granny reveals herself to the pair and threatens to expose their scam to Jed, and thus the impending wedding will be off. But before she can do so, they capture her, restrain her, and have her institutionalized at the Los Viejos Nursing Home, so that she cannot contact Jed. At the wedding, Woodrow prepares to transfer all of Clampett's money in Drysdale's bank to a Swiss account, on his laptop computer, when the couple says 'I do'. Realizing that Granny is missing, Jane goes to the office of Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) and after learning where Granny is and who Laura is, poses as a nurse and breaks her out. Granny and Jane arrive at the wedding and foil Laura and Tyler's plan when Jane grabs a shotgun and blows the laptop to bits, before they can steal Jed's money. The police arrest Laura and Woodrow. Jed decides that, since the wedding was off, they should have 'one hellacious shindig'. Cast Jim Varney as Jedidiah D.

Parton's appearance reunited her with 9 to 5 co-stars Lily Tomlin and Dabney Coleman. Box office In its first weekend, The Beverly Hillbillies grossed $9,525,375 at the box office. The film moved up to number one two weeks later. The total worldwide gross was $57,405,220, making it a moderate box office success. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22% based on reviews from 32 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Wasting a talented cast and director Penelope Spheeris' deft comedic touch on crude hijinks, this lame adaptation digs for comedic gold and only finds dirt.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating 'generally unfavorable reviews'. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of 'B+' on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film half a star out of a possible 4, arguing that it did not capture the appeal of the original television series nor did it improve the source material. Furthermore, he wrote that The Beverly Hillbillies was a major disappointment for Spheeris after her surprising triumph with Wayne's World the year before: \\"When directors make a wonderful movie, you look forward to their next one with a special anticipation, thinking maybe they've got the secret. If it turns out they don't, you feel almost betrayed. That's how I felt after The Beverly Hillbillies, one of the worst movies of this or any year.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, wrote: \\"The Beverly Hillbillies is not, as the saying goes, a critic‚Äôs picture. Still, you want to root for a movie that wallows without shame in leering, fatuous humor. I did ‚Äî for about 15 minutes ‚Äî then the sameness set in like an overdose of Beavis and Butt-Head.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a grade 'D' and wrote: 'The plot, which features Lea Thompson as a gold digger scheming to marry Jed, is like something you'd catch on the USA Network at 4 a.m. But enough of beating a dead possum. After sitting through The Beverly Hillbillies, I now realize that the best tribute anyone can make to the pop detritus of our childhood is to let it rest in peace.'

The film is a spiritual successor to Clouse's prior film Enter the Dragon, in which Kelly had a supporting role. Here, Kelly features in his first starring role as the eponymous character; is a local hero who fights the Mafia and a local drug dealer threatening his friend‚Äôs dojo. Plot The Mafia have learned of the construction of a new civic center, and have bought up all the land at the intended building site except for a karate dojo owned by Pop Byrd (Scatman Crothers), who refuses to give up his property. The Don contacts an indebted drug dealer named Pinky, who had laundered $250,000 from the Mafia that he'd subsequently loaned to Pop Byrd in-order to get the dojo built. The Don orders Pinky to either get his money back or repossess the property. Black Belt Jones (Jim Kelly), an expert martial artist and hand-for-hire, is contacted by his old friend Pop to help protect the dojo. Though Pinky intends to offer Pop to trade the building in exchange for clearing their mutual debt to the Don, he accidentally kills him during an intimidation attempt. Before he dies, Pop tells Pinky that he couldn't give them the building even if he wanted to, as it belongs not to him but his daughter Sydney. Pinky sends thugs to the dojo to try and intimidate the other employees. Though he was unable to protect his friend, Jones and the other students effortlessly fend off the thugs. Sydney (Gloria Hendry) returns home upon hearing of her father's sudden death. She's told about his debt to the Mafia, but refuses to sell the building, instead seeking vengeance on those responsible for her father's death.. Sydney approaches Pinky‚Äôs men and ends up in a brawl, managing to overcome them due to her own martial arts training. As retaliation, Pinky kidnaps one of the students, Quincy (Eric Laneuville) and demands for them to turn over the school or give him the money. Jones and Sydney, with support from the police department, rob the Mafia and proceed to give it to Pinky, framing him for the heist. They rescue Quincy, and Pinky proceeds to send his henchmen after Jones, who has to take them on all at once. Jones and his allies manage to subdue them, and they are subsequently arrested.

While glass remained his most commonly addressed medium, he worked with metal, wood, textiles, and porcelain (china). Sarpaneva has entered homes around the world through his industrial design of upscale, artistically conceived items, including cast-iron cookware and porcelain dinnerware. His work was among the key components that helped to launch Finland's reputation as a trailblazer of design.  Biography  = Early = As with his grandfather's anvil prominently displayed to introduce visitors to his 2002 retrospective exhibition at the Design Museum in Helsinki, Timo Sarpaneva narrated his family heritage as that of craftsmen. He would mention his maternal grandfather, a blacksmith, whose profession Sarpaneva claimed as his family's tradition \\"for hundreds of years,\\" and said others were textile artists noting his mother used to make tea cozies. His one-year-older brother Pentti was a graphic designer and made bronze and silver jewelry. With hyperbole, Timo Sarpaneva said he already knew in the womb that he would become a craftsman. His professional response to glass was related to his early memories of molten metal in his grandfather's workshop. A childhood sensation that he would periodically recount later as inspirational for his innovative approach to glass objects spoke of transparency and space: > At the age of eight or nine, I held a piece of ice in my hand until I'd made > a hole in it with my warm finger. Sarpaneva's organic hole in a glass body then appeared at roughly the same time as Henry Moore began to make use of concavities in his human sculptures, and some of his other work with glass is suggestive of that experience. = Employment = Sarpaneva graduated from the Institute for Industrial Arts (the forerunner of the University of Arts and Design) in Helsinki in 1948 and received a PhD h.c. later. Shortly after he began to work with glass, he won the Iittala competition in engraved glass and was hired by the company in 1951 (other sources mention the previous year) as a designer and director of exhibitions. He won his first Grand Prix at the 1954 Milan Triennale for his clear glass series, which also went to his already well-established colleague at Iittala, Tapio Wirkkala. In 1956, Sarpaneva embraced colored glass as he developed Iittala's new upscale i-linja (i-line) series of plates, bottles, and other objects. Radical for that time, his involvement extended to the design of the packaging and of Iittala's name with a prominent, white, lower- case letter i in a red circle as the new line's trademark, which the company then adopted as its universal logo through the 21st century. i-linja won him his second Grand Prix at the 1957 Milan Triennale, where he also received a Grand Prix for his design of the Finnish exhibition. In the meantime, he worked on his English at the newly opened Helsinki branch of Berlitz International in the second half of the 1950s, soon began to teach at his alma mater, including a course in linoleum block printing for students of textile design, and became full professor in 1976. Having already worked for the textiles association PMK in the 1950s (and planned an eventually canceled 1957 Triennale garment show for Marimekko in an early recognition that ready-made fashion was beginning to be appreciated as an industrial art), he continued in the 1960s with cloth designs for Tampella and acted as an artistic director for the Swedish textile company Kinnasand between 1964 and 1972, after which he started his association with the German porcelain producer Rosenthal. He commuted between Helsinki and Murano (Venice, Italy) for six years in the 1990s, making mostly sculptures with the Venini glassmakers and the renowned craftsman Pino Signoretto. All along, despite a hiatus in the 1970s when Iittala sought to cancel some of its glass production techniques, Sarpaneva maintained a creative relationship with his first employer for most of his productive life. He was survived by his four adult children and his wife of nine years, Marjatta n√©e Svennevig, whom he married at Helsinki Cathedral in 1997 after 30 years of living together and who designed his tombstone at the Hietaniemi Cemetery, now closed to further burials, the last resting place of numerous people influential in Finnish history, politics, and culture. M√§ntyniemi silverware (1992) was designed for the new, eponymous presidential residence. = Pro Finlandia = A degree of patriotism translated both to his close acquaintance with Finland's long-serving President Urho Kekkonen, from whom Sarpaneva received the Pro Finlandia Medal of the Order of the Lion of Finland in 1958 for his success at the Milan Triennale, and to the names of some of his internationally marketed production, Finlandia for a \\"bark glass\\" vase series and Suomi (\\"Finland\\") for a tableware design. He designed glass vases and silver dinnerware for the presidential residence M√§ntyniemi opened in 1993. The image of Finland as a trailblazer of design has long been based on its post-World War II success and on the reputation of Sarpaneva and a handful of its other \\"designer heroes.\\"  Work  Cast-iron pot (1959), historically modern for \\"a damned good stew.\\" The cast-iron pot (cauldron, casserole) Sarpaneva designed in 1959 (production from 1960), which made it onto a Finnish postal stamp in 1998, became emblematic of his creative approach ‚Äì modern in a way that did not lean too heavily on novelty, it rethought a traditional piece, put history and humanity back into industrial design, and made \\"a damn good reindeer stew in the process.\\" Having reintroduced it to market in 2003, the manufacturer, Iittala, considers its timeless and ingenious design to be as functional in the kitchen as it is appealing on the dining table. Work like Sarpaneva's proved that the intrinsic quality of materials reduced to their most basic, sensuous essence, shaped by the creative imagination of an artist, beat all the kitsch in the world. Sarpaneva thought the turning point in his career came for him at the age of 22 when he received the second prize in the Riihim√§ki Glass Design Contest ‚Äì second only to his college professor, Arttu Brummer, who won the top award. Sarpaneva worked intermittently with metal, wood, textiles, ceramics, and porcelain (china), while glass remained his main medium from his earliest awards for much of his life, both in industrial design and in display art objects. Trained as a graphic designer, he spent the majority of his life in industrial design while seeing himself more as an artist than a designer. But he discounted the option with a joke when confronted with rumors that Andy Warhol had suggested Sarpaneva's fabrics were masterstrokes ready to be framed as paintings. Nevertheless, Sarpaneva's international career opened up with a comparable feat in textile design when he received a Silver Medal at the 1951 Milan Triennale for his submission Kukko, an embroidered tea cozy styled as a rooster (hence its Finnish name) with the bird's serrated red comb as its handle, mistaken by some at the exhibition for a carnival hat.  Textiles  In the 1950s‚Äì1960s, Sarpaneva created fabric designs for a number of companies associated in PMK (Puuvillatehtaitten myyntikonttori, \\"Cotton Mills' Sales Office\\"). = Ambiente = His radical, painterly Ambiente series designed for a linen division of Tampella in the mid-1960s brought robotization to cloth pattern production. Close to 2,000 automated machine settings, which Sarpaneva called \\"industrial monotypes,\\" enabled extensive variation in color schemes, from intense crimson and turquoise to subtle pea green, cream, and black. Blurring, merging, and distortion resulted in fluid psychedelic patterns and added another layer to the number of options the modified two-sided rotary printing opened for its manufacturers and marketers. The production was based on an invention Sarpaneva made when visiting a manufacturer of packaging paper, where the printing press was malfunctioning so that the colors mixed and bled on the paper. Sarpaneva thought that achieving the same effect intentionally on cloth would create a varying, fluid pattern where exactly the same pattern would never be repeated. Ambiente attracted international attention, provoking Andy Warhol to jokingly suggest to Sarpaneva that he should sell the line as unique pieces of art, adding that \\"you would be a millionaire\\".Signage texts in Timo Sarpaneva exhibition, Design museum, Helsinki, 2018.  Porcelain  = Suomi = Sarpaneva's work in industrial design received its highest recognition with his porcelain (china) full-line dinner service Suomi (\\"Finland\\"), on which he worked for four years (some sources say three or two). Commissioned by the German company Rosenthal, which first considered the concept too simple, it was launched in its \\"studio-line\\" in 1976. The originally all-white modern classic with gently rounded corners was made part of the permanent collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris as an example of contemporary design and has remained in production through the 2010s. Sarpaneva said his inspiration came from the forms of rocks rounded and polished by moving water. It combined the circle with the square, a merger of the organic forms of the craft tradition and the straight lines associated with modern industry. The pieces of the chip-resistant service appealed to the hand as well as the eye. Big, comfortable handles made the cups sturdy and easy to hold, rims on the plates prevented spills, tea and coffee pots poured without dripping. Still in the 1970s, Rosenthal made Suomi the canvass for high-art surface designs limited to 500-set runs by artists renowned at the time, including Salvador Dal√≠ and Victor Vasarely. The company also adjusted Suomi for customers looking to inject self-expression. It manufactured Suomi in a parallel Porcelaine noire series and allowed customers to mix and purchase the luminous white and uncommon black-porcelain pieces in any desired contrastive combination. In a separate modification, the producer catered to those seeking more opulence with gold- and platinum-trimmed Suomi series. Such marketing was not always appreciated on aesthetic grounds with the argument that the decorated versions of various sorts related poorly to Sarpaneva's refined shapes, and that Suomi was extraordinary only in plain white. = Limited series = On the occasion of launching his Sun in the Forest cup-and-saucer set in London, Sarpaneva said his forms were sometimes inspired by sound. > When I go very deep into the forest, all of my senses are alerted. That is > when I can hear with my eyes. Direct references to sound translated to images also accompanied the promo material with his mug-and-saucer combo Song of the Troll.  Glass  Lansetti, among the Grand Prix winners of Milan triennale 1954. Kajakki, among the Grand Prix winners of Milan triennale 1954. Sarpaneva was a proliferous designer of glass art, both sculpture and functional objects. He pioneered many new methods in glass making, together with the glassblowers of Iittala glassworks. Among the new methods developed was the wet-stick method where spherical spaces within glass are created not by blowing, but by protruding a wet stick into the glass mass. The contact with the hot mass causes the water to evaporate whereupon the vapor blows a cavity into the glass. The glassmakers of Iittala developed a habit of picking up, on their way to work, fallen branches of apple trees, a type of wood particularly well-suited for the purpose. This method is central to many of Sarpaneva's glass art series, such as Kajakki and Orchid. = Lancet, Kajakki and Orchid = Sarpaneva's first international recognition in glass work came with a Grand Prix from the Milan Triennale in 1954 that included Sarpaneva's series Orkidea (\\"Orchid\\"), Kajakki (\\"Kayak\\"), and Lansetti (\\"Lancet\\") adopted for production by Iittala. He said of his favorite material: > Glass is very mysterious. It's changing all the time. That's what makes it > magical. It released me from the conventional and the three-dimensional. It > opened its deepest reaches to me and took me on a journey to a fourth > dimension. I understood the opportunities that clear, transparent glass > gives to an artist and designer. The amoeboid abstraction \\"Lancet II\\" of the latter series, an asymmetrical clear-glass vase whose shape is only partly echoed by its hollow center, was selected by the U.S. magazine House Beautiful as \\"The Most Beautiful Design Object of the Year\\" 1954. At his hands distinctions between pure and applied art gradually became less and less meaningful ‚Äì the glass vases he created in the 1950s exhibited clear sculptural qualities long before he decided to sever his connection with the vessel as a form in 1964 and to make pure sculpture in glass. = Finlandia = The Finlandia line of \\"bark glass\\" vases produced by Iittala in 1964-1970 brought about another innovation, mass-produced household objects each of which was, in a way, exclusive. The collection was distinguished by the presence of thick glass with a rough surface that brought to mind snow and ice, replacing in one blow the smooth, thin, streamlined colored glass of the 1950s. Sarpaneva recalled: > I found a heap of discarded wooden molds used for making polished glass and > decided to make a different kind of glass with them. Each piece was slightly > different in its shape and surface. Glass was poured or blown into the molds and allowed to remain long enough for the molds to burn, thereby roughening the surfaces. Each time the mold was blown into, the grain texture changed causing each object in the Finlandia series to be unique although mold-blown. The molds were gradually, and intentionally, destroyed through repeated contact with glass heated to 500 ¬∞C (932 F). The changing surface gave each piece a natural randomized \\"bark\\" effect created by the carbonized wood, which could not otherwise be convincingly created by an artist. = Sculpture = The Year Zero glass sculpture.  Pack Ice / Mirror of the Sea  Sarpaneva made his and Finland's largest glass sculpture, Ahtoj√§√§ (\\"Pack Ice,\\" renamed from J√§√§vuori, \\"Iceberg\\"), for the Finnish pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal in 1967. It was then bought by the City of Tampere and remained in storage until 1988 when it was installed in the entrance lobby of the KoskiKeskus shopping mall opened in downtown Tampere in March of that year. The 12 m (36 ft.) long and 6.4 m (21 ft.) wide triangle is suspended from the ceiling and filled with 488, up to 1 m (3.3 ft.) high, faceted and noduled glass turrets. Sarpaneva expanded his original concept by attaching Meren peili (\\"Mirror of the Sea\\") below Ahtoj√§√§, mirror panes interpreting the surface of the sea (the Baltic Sea is partly covered with ice around Finland in the winter, but ice-free in the summer), in order to reminisce on fluidity and the cycle of life, which also subsumed a Finnish take on the two manifestations of the country's denotative multitude of lakes ‚Äì white ice in the winter and a blue mirror in the summer. Nordic art specialists often compared Sarpaneva's ability to capture light along with its hues to looking through ice beneath the sea.  Smile  Glass was also the material of his rare work that addressed trans-Atlantic cultural influences. The small, black blown-glass piece Smile with a glossy finish features two large Disneyesque ears rising above a mouth and refers to Mickey Mouse. The ears signify Mickey's state of being, while the sculpture transforms Mickey into a set of abstract geometric relationships.

The Finnish police estimated the total value of the forgeries of his and some of his peers' designs reached millions of euros and expected it to grow. Occasional, partly tongue-in-cheek, criticism of some of the designs ‚Äì that the versatile teak handle with the cast-iron pot would get lost, that white Suomi showed tea stains unlike classic British brown tea pots ‚Äì did not undermine their appreciation. Historically, Christie's executives commented on growth in resale value especially with Sarpaneva's glass creations for the Italian Venini company. Older objects from the same series would be more valuable, for instance, an item from the first year of the Kajakki (Kayak) series, which ran from 1953 to 1959, might fetch 50% more than the same object from the last year of production. Bargain hunters occasionally reported high returns, including the purchase of a Sarpaneva glass plate for 25 cents in a garage sale, which turned out to have a resale value of US$1,000.

The title track was re- recorded by Joe Perry's more successful band Aerosmith on its album Done With Mirrors, albeit with a slightly different melody and Steven Tyler-penned lyrics. Background Fed up with the slow pace of the recording of Night in the Ruts and frustrated with the band's precarious financial situation, Perry left Aerosmith in the spring of 1979. He recruited Aerosmith's former producer Jack Douglas and shared vocal duties with Ralph Morman, who Perry had previously heard in a band called Daddy Warbux.

It is located approximately to the southwest of the nation's capital Mogadishu. Merca is the traditional home territory of the 12 Koofi and Bimal clan and was the center of the Bimal Revolt or Merka Revolt.http://www.landinfo.no/asset/2736/1/2736_1.pdf Marka is the traditional home territory of the Dir clan Biimaal (Lewis 2008, p. 5). History =Medieval Period= Minaret and moonrise in Merca During the Middle Ages, the area was one of several prominent administrative centers of the Ajuran Sultanate. The polity formed one of the largest kingdoms in the Horn region. Various pillar tombs exist in the region, which local tradition holds were built in the 16th century, when the Sultanate's naa'ibs governed the district. The 14th-century Arab geographer Ibn Sa'id described Merca as a capital in the Hawiye country. During the 12th century, the cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi included Merca as a coastal city left from the country of Hadiye, which Herbert S. Lewis believes is a scribal error for \\"Hawiye\\", as do Guilliani, Schleicher and Cerulli.Herbert S. Lewis, \\"The Origins of the Galla and Somali\\", in The Journal of African History. Cambridge University Press, 1966, pp 27-30 (not scholarly peer reviewed). =Early Modern= One of the most powerful sultanates to have emerged from Southern Somalia called the Geledi Sultanate around Afgoye in the late 18th (1750) century tried to attack and destroy the Bimal clan many times to try and capture the coastal city of Merca. But the Bimal of Merca managed to defeat the Geledi Sultanate 2 times. In 1843 Yusuf Mahamud, Sultan of Geledi, vows to destroy the Bimal for once and for all and mobilizes the Geledi confederacy containing over 16 clans. In 1848 the sultan of the Geledi, Yusuf Mahamud was is killed at Adaddey Suleyman, a village near Marka, in a battle between the Bimal and Geledi Sultanate. His son Ahmed Yusuf tried to seej revenge but was also killed in 1878 at Agaaran, near Marka by the Bimaal. This caused a steady decline to the Geledi Sultanate.  Bimal Revolt  The Bimal revolt, Bimal resistance, or Banadir resistance was a guerrilla war against the Italian Somaliland in southern Somalia. It was fought from the years 1896 to 1926 and largely concentrated in the Lower Shebelle, Banadir and Middle Shebelle. The war was centered around Merka and Danane. It is compared to the war of the Mad Mullah in northern Somalia. Named after the Bimal clan since they were the major element in the resistance. Notable elders and the Sultan belonging to the Bimal clan in Merca For more about Bimal or Merca revolt see: * Modern In the 1930s a group of Italian Somalis established residency in Merca. The Port of Merca was the second in Italian Somalia and was nicknamed the \\"port of bananas\\" due to its status as a key exporter of bananas from Somalia to Europe. In the city of Merca there was a huge economical development in the 1930s, due mainly to the growing commerce of the port of Merca connected by small railway to the farm area of Genale. Merca was abandoned by government forces and captured by Al-Shabaab in February 2016. It was recaptured by the Somali National Army along with African Union troops, a few days later. A small battle was fought in which a Somali soldier, several militants, and four civilians died.

He is one of Spain's most celebrated novelists, and his work has been translated into 42 languages. Life Javier Mar√≠as was born in Madrid. His father was the philosopher Juli√°n Mar√≠as, who was briefly imprisoned and then banned from teaching for opposing Franco (the father of the protagonist of Your Face Tomorrow was given a similar biography). Mar√≠as is the fourth of five sons Aida Edemariam, \\"Looking for Luisa\\", The Guardian, 7 May 2005. and spent parts of his childhood in the United States, where his father taught at various institutions, including Yale University and Wellesley College. His mother died when Javier was 26 years old. His first literary employment consisted in translating Dracula scripts for his maternal uncle, Jes√∫s Franco.Hardworking King of Redonda.New new Directions Publishing biography . He was educated at the Colegio Estudio in Madrid. =Writing= Mar√≠as began writing in earnest at an early age. \\"The Life and Death of Marcelino Iturriaga\\", one of the short stories in While the Women are Sleeping (2010), was written when he was just 14. He wrote his first novel, Los dominios del lobo (The Dominions of the Wolf), at the age of 17, after running away to Paris. His second novel, Traves√≠a del horizonte (Voyage Along the Horizon), was an adventure story about an expedition to Antarctica. After attending the Complutense University of Madrid, Mar√≠as turned his attention to translating English novels into Spanish. His translations included work by Updike, Hardy, Conrad, Nabokov, Faulkner, Kipling, James, Stevenson, Browne, and Shakespeare. In 1979 he won the Spanish national award for translation for his version of Sterne's Tristram Shandy. Between 1983 and 1985 he lectured in Spanish literature and translation at the University of Oxford. In 1986 Mar√≠as published El hombre sentimental (The Man of Feeling), and in 1988 he published Todas las almas (All Souls), which was set at Oxford University. The Spanish film director Gracia Querejeta released El √öltimo viaje de Robert Rylands, adapted from Todas las almas, in 1996. His 1992 novel Coraz√≥n tan blanco was a commercial and critical success and for its English version A Heart So White, translated by Margaret Jull Costa, Mar√≠as and Costa were joint winners of the 1997 International Dublin Literary Award. His 1994 novel, Ma√±ana en la batalla piensa en m√≠, whose protagonist is a ghostwriter, won the Venezuelan R√≥mulo Gallegos Prize. The protagonists of the novels written since 1986 are all interpreters or translators of one kind or another, based on his own experience as a translator and teacher of translation at Oxford University. Of these protagonists, Mar√≠as has written, \\"They are people who are renouncing their own voices.\\" In 2002 Mar√≠as published Tu rostro ma√±ana 1. Fiebre y lanza (Your Face Tomorrow 1: Fever and Spear), the first part of a trilogy that is his most ambitious literary project. The first volume is dominated by a translator, an elderly don based on an actual professor emeritus of Spanish studies at Oxford University, Sir Peter Russell. The second volume, Tu rostro ma√±ana 2. Baile y sue√±o (Your Face Tomorrow 2: Dance and Dream), was published in 2004. In 2007, Mar√≠as completed the final installment, Tu rostro ma√±ana 3. Veneno y sombra y adi√≥s (Your Face Tomorrow 3: Poison, Shadow and Farewell). Mar√≠as operates a small publishing house under the name of Reino de Redonda. He also writes a weekly column in El Pa√≠s. In 2005-06 an English version of his column, \\"La Zona Fantasma\\", appeared in the monthly magazine The Believer.Contributors - Javier Mar√≠as, Believer Magazine. Mar√≠as was elected to Seat R of the Real Academia Espa√±ola on 29 June 2006. He took up his seat on 27 April 2008. At his investiture he agreed with Robert Louis Stevenson that the work of novelists is \\"pretty childish,\\" but also argued that it is impossible to narrate real events, and that ‚Äúyou can only fully tell stories about what has never happened, the invented and imagined.‚ÄùJavier Marias joins Spanish Royal Academy. In 2013, Mar√≠as was awarded the prestigious Prix Formentor. =Redonda= Mar√≠as's novel, Todas las almas (All Souls), included a portrayal of the poet John Gawsworth, who was also the third King of Redonda. Although the fate of this monarchy after the death of Gawsworth is contested, the portrayal by Mar√≠as so affected the \\"reigning\\" king, Jon Wynne- Tyson, that he abdicated and left the throne to Mar√≠as in 1997. This course of events was chronicled in his \\"false novel,\\" Negra espalda del tiempo (Dark Back of Time). The book was inspired by the reception of Todas las almas by many people who, falsely according to Mar√≠as, believed they were the source of the characters in Todas las almas. Since \\"taking the throne\\" of Redonda, Mar√≠as has begun a publishing imprint named Reino de Redonda (\\"Kingdom of Redonda\\"). Mar√≠as has conferred many titles during his reign upon people he likes, including upon Pedro Almod√≥var (Duke of Tr√©mula), Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes (Duke of Cocodrilos), John Ashbery (Duke of Convexo), Pierre Bourdieu (Duke of Desarraigo), William Boyd (Duke of Brazzaville), Michel Braudeau (Duke of Miranda), A.

The university was founded in 1968 alongside the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) and the University of the Basque Country (UPV), in Barcelona and Bilbao, respectively. The campus of the university spans a rural tract of 650 acres, mostly around metropolitan Madrid. Founded in 1968, its main campus, Cantoblanco, is located near the cities of Alcobendas, San Sebasti√°n de los Reyes and Tres Cantos. UAM's Cantoblanco Campus holds most of the university's facilities. It is located 15 km north of Madrid and has an extension of over 2,200,000 m¬≤. Of these are nearly 770,000 urbanised and about a third of them garden areas. UAM offers 94 doctorate programs in all of the universities studies. It also offers 72 unrecognized master's degrees.  History  The Stabilization Plan of 1959 and the development plans of the 1960s boosted the Spanish economy after years of austerity and the self- sufficiency-based economy. The end of diplomatic and economic isolation led to an economic boom in Spain that resulted in the consolidation of a middle class similar to that of other Western European nations. The demand of higher education increased, and the Spanish university system grew increasingly congested. The Autonomous University of Madrid was established by the 5-1968 Decree approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers during the Francoist dictatorship along with the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the University of Bilbao. This decree was sponsored by the then-Minister of Science and Education, Jos√© Luis Villar Palas√≠, in order to restructure the Spanish university system. The name Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid first appeared in an executive order by the Ministry which was published on 13 August 1968. On 8 June 2018 the Autonomous University of Madrid celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a series of commemorative events, starting with a debate on university autonomy (after the scandal of the former president of the Community of Madrid, Cristina Cifuentes and her Master degree in the University Juan Carlos I). In the debate, called \\"Past, present and future (1968‚Äì2018)\\", the rector of the UAM Rafael Garesse, and the rectors of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Margarita Arboix, and the Basque Country, Nekane Balluerka participated. Campuses =Main campus= The Cantoblanco Campus, October 2010 UAM's Cantoblanco Campus holds most of the university's facilities. It is located 15 km north of Madrid and has an extension of over 2,200,000 m¬≤. Of these are nearly 770,000 urbanised and about a third of them garden areas. The campus was designed as a university town that was to be self-sufficient, but also would be away from Madrid in order to keep student activity against the Francoist dictatorship away from the capital. Initially, the campus held the faculties of philosophy and liberal arts, law, economics, business management, and science, as well as the rectorate, several other service buildings and sports facilities. The university's other facilities, the faculty of medicine and the teacher training Santa Maria school are in downtown Madrid. There are two other teacher training schools in Segovia and in Cuenca. Over the years, the faculty of psychology, the biology building of the faculty of sciences, the new faculty of law (that allowed the transfer of the teacher training school to the main campus, and that was later transformed in faculty of education and teacher training) along with its political science annex building, the polytechnic school (initially superior technical school of computing engineers), the libraries of humanities and sciences, as well as the Erasmus of Rotterdam dormitory have been built on the main campus.Faculty of Law (Facultad de Derecho), October 2010 The original faculties were housed in interconnected buildings with several patios in between them. Characteristic of each building is a large number of stairs in its corridors, initially designed to prevent students from running in case of police raids. Currently, this fact has been considered by many university officials as a setback in the integration of handicapped students. The newest facilities were built in a contemporary style, being more accessible and allowing more free movement to students. Sporting facilities include two swimming pools (an indoor one and an outdoor one), two multiple-use pavilions, and outdoor tennis, football, basketball, paddle tennis, rugby, and futsal and beach volleyball courts. Other services on campus include 16 cafeterias and other eating facilities, medical services, a pharmacy with optic care, a foreign languages pavilion, and a bookstore. The campus also houses several research facilities partnered with the Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC). Cantoblanco Campus is accessible by train belonging to Renfe Cercanias Commuter service (station Cantoblanco-Universidad), or by the Madrid Region Commuter Bus service. The campus is located in the B1 area of the Madrid Transports Consortium. =Medicine Campus= UAM faculty of medicine is located north of Madrid near La Paz teaching hospital (that acts as one of the faculty's teaching hospitals, as Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda Hospital, La Princesa Hospital, Ni√±o Jes√∫s Hospital and Fundaci√≥n Jim√©nez D√≠az do). It was inaugurated in 1969. Juan Luis Vives Residence Hall was UAM's first residential facility. It is located in the Plaza Castilla area in northern Madrid. It has 130 residents and holds several cultural activities of the university. =La Cristalera= La Cristalera residence is located in Miraflores de la Sierra, a village north of Madrid that was acquired by the university in 1989. It is used for conferences and meetings and is the main centre of UAM's summer courses. Academic organization alt= The university's train station, October 2010 The UAM is divided into eight faculties and superior schools that support and coordinate most of the university's academic and administrative activity. Each faculty is divided into departments that coordinate the teaching and research of the different subjects. Researchers can organise into research institutes in order to coordinate their activities in a specific research field. The university totals up to 59 departments and eight research institutes. In addition to these, the UAM has seven associate schools, which are not completely part of UAM's administrative structure, but issue UAM-recognised titles and are under UAM's academic regulations. Faculties and superior schools: * Faculty of Philosophy and Liberal Arts * Faculty of Law * Faculty of Economical Science and Business Management * Faculty of Sciences * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Psychology * Engineering School (until 2002 Superior School of Computer Engineers) * Faculty of Teacher Training and Education (until 2002 Santa Maria School of Teacher Training) Associate schools are: * Red Cross School of Nursing * Puerta de Hierro School of Nursing * Jimenez Diaz Foundation School of Nursing * ONCE School of physiotherapy * LaSalle Institute of Higher Education * Escuela de Gemolog√≠a Administrative organisation Rectorate building, October 2010 UAM administration is established according to the 2001's Organic Law of Universities (LOU). The Senior Academic and Administrative Officer of the Autonomous University of Madrid is the rector, who must be, by law, a chair professor serving in the university, elected every four years with a two-term limit by universal graded suffrage. The current rector is Jos√© Maria Sanz, chair of applied physics, who substituted his predecessor Angel Gabilondo in 2009, when Gabilondo became Minister of Education. To aid the rector in the management of the university, he or she appoints an indefinite number of vice-rectors leading different administrative departments of the university (such as Student affairs or Graduate academic affairs), and a secretary general coordinating the rector's team and overseeing the legal procedures of the university, as well as university protocol. The rector, in accordance with the university's social board, also designates the manager as part of his team, which oversees the university's economic and administrative activity. The grades assigned to each sector for rectoral elections in UAM according to its charter are: * Full professors: 51% of the final votes * Students: 28% of the final votes * Other professors: 9% * Non-teaching personnel: 9% * Teaching and research personnel in training: 3%. UAM's collective government bodies are the University Assembly, The Board of Governors, and The Social Board. The University Assembly is made out of 153 full professors, 84 students, 27 hired, associate, or emeritus professors, 27 members of the non-teaching personnel, 9 research or teaching trainees, the rector, the secretary general, and the manager. It is the highest representative body of the university. It elaborates the university's general guidelines, changes or passes a new university charter, elects twenty members of the Board of Governors, and elects the University Ombudsman. The Board of Governors is the ordinary governmental body of the university. It controls and passes regulations on most of the university's academic, personnel, and administrative issues. It is composed of the rector, the secretary general, the manager, 20 members elected by the assembly according to its composition, all the deans and the head of the polytechnic school, 7 heads of department, a head of research institute, 15 members designated by the rector and three members of the Social Board. The Social Board is the body responsible for the relations between university and society. Its members are designated by trade unions, the municipality of Madrid, employers unions, companies related to the university, the Madrid Assembly and the Board of Governors of the university. It also oversees the universities financial activities and passes the university budget. Its current chairman is Manuel Pizarro. Faculties are headed by a dean, whilst the responsible of the polytechnic school is called head. They are elected in the same way as the rector and have also a limit of two four-year terms. They are aided by vice-deans or deputy heads. They are overseen by a faculty or school board. Departments are led by the head of department and overseen by the department council. Studies =Undergraduate= UAM offers Spanish undergraduates fully recognized degrees. There are the Diplomatura and Ingenier√≠as T√©cnicas (technical engineering), which are three-year studies equivalent to an associate degree. Licenciaturas and Ingenier√≠as Superiores are four to five years studies equivalent to a bachelor's degree. Along with that, UAM offers second level licenciaturas, which allow people who have a diplomatura to obtain a licenciatura by taking courses. In other case, they must have at least the first two or three years of a licenciatura and combined degree, which are very popular among Spanish students. They also offer courses in languages other than Spanish. In addition to the Faculties where the degrees on the different fields of knowledge and science are studied ‚ÄîFaculty of Science, F. of Business and Economic Science, F. of Law, F. of Philosophy and the Arts, F. of Teacher Training and Education, F. of Psychology, F. of Medicine and School of Engineering‚Äî there are external centers that teach specific studies and their associated degree: \\"La Salle\\" Centre of Higher Education, The Red Cross School of Nursing, The Jimenez Diaz Foundation University School of Nursing, The ONCE University School of Physioterapy. =Graduate= UAM offers 94 PhD programs in all of the universities programs. It also offers 72 unrecognised master's degrees, and with the implementation of the Bologna Process 16 recognised master's degrees for the academic year of 2006-07.Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid - CURSO 2010-2011  Research  In addition, the alliance of the four leading Spanish public Universities, two in Madrid (Aut√≥noma University of Madrid and Universidad Carlos III) and two in Barcelona (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, Universitat Pompeu Fabra) allows close collaboration between projects and researchers.  Reputation  Throughout its history, the UAM has been one of Spain's most prominent higher education institutions, being ranked second amongst Spanish universities by the El Mundo University Supplement (known as \\"Las 50 Carreras\\") (after the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona). For the subject \\"Mathematics\\" the university was ranked within top 51-75 universities in the world (within top 12 in Europe).Academic Ranking of World Universities in Mathematics-2012 It was the Spanish university with the most researchers among the most cited according to the Thomson Reuters ranking citation in 2011. Student life Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente Avenue. Tomas Y Valiente was murdered by ETA in his office at the Faculty of Law in 1996 A panel debate at UAM in 2005 =Societies and compromise= The Autonomous University of Madrid has an active student body, having organised one of Spain's most important events against the dictatorship in 1976 called the Iberian Peoples Festival. It had an attendance of over 70,000. UAM has over a hundred student societies covering activities ranging from student unionism to theatre and music. The oldest active association in UAM is the Law Students Association (AED in Spanish), a left-leaning student union established in 1981. Furthermore, there are new prominent societies in the field of social sciences, such a Debate Society (Sociedad de Debates UAM) and a Model UN society (UAM-I-MUN), both founded and run mainly by law students. UAM does not have a formal student government body, as it has been rejected by students in several occasions, and instead students elect different student unions (usually with difference on political issues) to the different university government bodies. In recent years, UAM students have organised massively to protest against terrorism, after the assassination of Francisco Tomas y Valiente by ETA in 1995, against the Organic Law of Universities in 2001, to clean Spain's northern coast after the Prestige oil spill in 2002, against the War in Iraq in 2003, to assist to the II European Social Forum also in 2003, and in solidarity with the victims of the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. =Festivals and parties= UAM is also a festive campus, holding several festivals during spring. The most important one was the Spring festival held until 1993, but halted due to massification. Since then minor festivals have been held by student associations. These festivals usually consist of rock concerts by amateur rock bands (many of which have members that are UAM) from midday until dusk. According to university regulations, festival profits have to be destined to charities or to the organisation of cultural events. In 2005, due to massification of the festivals that led to several problems, university officials suspended further festivals until a more convenient place for their celebration would be found. Thus, no festivals were held in 2006.

It is part of the City of Portland. The island is only accessible by boat. Public access is prohibited, except for an on request tour sanctioned by the island's owners. House Island includes three buildings on the east side and Fort Scammell on the west side. The buildings are used as summer residences. The island's name derives from the site of an early European house, believed that built by Capt. Christopher Levett, an English explorer of the region. On June 21, 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported the island for sale for $4.9m. Fort Scammell Henry A. S. Dearborn, an officer of the Massachusetts Militia and a future general, built Fort Scammell on the island in 1808 as part of the national second system of fortifications. It was named after Alexander Scammell, Adjutant-General of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, who was killed in action during the Battle of Yorktown. (The middle names of the fort's builder were also chosen after Scammell, a friend of the builder's father, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn.) The fort was designed for harbor defense, with cannon batteries designed to protect the main shipping channel into Portland harbor, along with Fort Preble. The spelling of the fort's name varies among references. The fort was made of stone, brick, and earth, and initially mounted fifteen guns and a 10-inch mortar.Wade, p. 139 The Secretary of War's report on fortifications for 1811 describes Fort Scammell as \\"a circular battery of masonry with circular flanks, mounting fifteen heavy guns, is covered in the rear with a wooden blockhouse, mounting six guns...\\".Wade, p. 241 Typical weapons of the period were 24-pounder or 32-pounder smoothbore cannon. In the 1840s‚Äì1850s, as part of the national third system of fortifications, Fort Scammell was modernized by extending its walls to enclose a larger area.Fort Scammel article at FortWiki.com Thomas Lincoln Casey, an Army engineer officer known for his work on the Washington Monument, completely rebuilt the fort beginning in 1862 during the American Civil War. As rebuilt to the new Third System design Fort Scammell was unique in the US, with the design centered on two three-tier stone-and-brick bastions connected by earth walls rather than stone curtain walls. A third bastion was never completed. To allow timely completion, the remaining bastions had a tier or two each removed from the design. As completed, the west bastion had a single tier of casemates and the east bastion had two tiers.Weaver, pp. 93‚Äì96 In the 1870s additional earthworks to accommodate 10-inch and 15-inch Rodman guns were constructed, but only some of these were completed due to a national freeze on fort construction in the late 1870s. Fort Scammell was not re-armed in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, and was listed as disarmed in a 1903 report. Two emplacements for anti-aircraft guns were added in 1917, probably for the 3-inch gun M1917. Of all the forts in Casco Bay, Fort Scammell was the only fort to fire a shot and be fired upon in battle, in early August 1813. Immigration Quarantine Station The island was later the site of an immigration quarantine station from 1907 to 1937, and was considered the 'Ellis Island of the North'. The quarantine station was busiest in the early 1920s, after the adoption of the Emergency Quota Act, which restricted the number of immigrants who could enter the country. In November 1923, the ships President Polk and George Washington were diverted from New York City to Portland, and 218 immigrants from those ships were quarantined at the station. The island was considered \\"ideal\\" by immigration officials. A Grand Trunk Railway station was located at the docks in Portland, allowing easy rail access for immigrants arriving in Portland. Additionally, William Husband, Commissioner General of United States Immigration, said the whole island was secure and \\"The whole of House Island was available in that case, instead of those detained being obliged to go out under guard with only few patches of green grass upon which they might set foot, as at some other places.\\" The 1920 brick detention barracks have been demolished, but the original 1907 buildings remain, including the doctor's house, the detention barracks, and the quarantine hospital.

History Montijo was known as Aldeia Galega until July 6, 1930, in spite of the fact that it was a small town and no longer a village. It was elevated to city status on August 14, 1985. Paleolithic vestiges of human settlement suggest that the region was occupied into the pre-history. Yet, the first historical references date to the 12th century, in 1186, with the donations of religious and hereditary lands to Paio Peres, that initiated formal occupation. Initially, the settlement was a constituted of poor hovels, that were villages for fishermen and farmers, but by the 14th century, the area had developed into a sizeable centre, with its own church, dedicated to S√£o Sebasti√£o. During the reigns of Afonso IV, Pedro and Fernando, Montijo was awarded various privileges that John I later confirmed in 1385. For a long time, the place formed one ecclesiastical parish with neighboring Alcochete, whose seat was in the village of Santa Maria de Sabonha, in the parish of S√£o Francisco. On 15 September 1514, Manual I conceded a foral (charter), which was quickly renewed on 17 January 1515, with Alcochete. In 1539, the centres separated resulting in administrative autonomy. The grand postmaster, Lu√≠s Afonso, established his seat in the south in 1533, due to its geographic conditions and close proximity to Spain and southern Portugal. A year earlier, John III had registered the title to the village of Aldea Galega. Over the years, many monarch passed through Montijo, such as the future John IV of Portugal, who arrived on 5 December 1640, to enthusiastic cheers from the nobles, clerics and people of the village. In 1808 Montijo suffered the roaming attacks and pillage of French forces. Twenty one years later, a carriage post between Montijo and Badajoz/Madrid, which was of short duration and lasted until 1831. In 1843, during an official visit, Queen Maria II of Portugal necessitated the carriage, allowing a 26-hour trip from Montijo to Badajoz. But, the service was suspended in 1864. Aldeia Galega was one of the first centres to celebrate the implantation of the 5 October 1910 revolution, before Lisbon and other major centres. Climate Transport The Vasco da Gama Bridge, inaugurated in 1998, connects Montijo with the capital city of Lisbon. Numerous roads, including the IC13, provide access to the south, east and west of Portugal. Although the train service via the Ramal do Montijo rail line was discontinued, Montijo maintains a network of public transportation that connects it to other nearby major cities and villages by bus and by a river service connecting it with Lisbon.

He is most famous for his work in tag teams, especially his days as one-half of The Midnight Express. Under the management of Jim Cornette, he originally teamed with Dennis Condrey and, later on, with Stan Lane. He also worked with a number of other tag team partners, including Koko B. Ware, Steve Keirn, and \\"Lord\\" Steven Regal. In his career, Eaton wrestled for extended periods of time for various wrestling promotions: Mid-America Wrestling, Continental Wrestling Association, Mid- South Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, and Smoky Mountain Wrestling. He also made brief guest appearances for Extreme Championship Wrestling, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, and a considerable number of independent wrestling promotions over the years. Early life Growing up in Huntsville, Alabama, Eaton was a fan of professional wrestling, especially the NWA Mid-America professional wrestling promotion. This promotion was operated by Nick Gulas, who staged wrestling shows in the Alabama and Tennessee region. Eaton's first involvement in the sport came at the age of 13, while attending Chapman Middle School, when he helped set up wrestling rings in his hometown. He later trained under Tojo Yamamoto to become a professional wrestler. Professional wrestling career =NWA Mid-America (1976‚Äì1980)= In May 1976, at the age of 17, Eaton made his debut in NWA Mid-America. He entered his first match, a loss to Bearcat Wright, as a last-minute substitute for Wright's absent opponent. He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship. Gulas decided to \\"promote\\" Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event. The angle that helped elevate Eaton's name up the card in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team The Hollywood Blonds (Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and \\"Pistol\\" Pez Whatley. When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America. In 1978, Eaton teamed with Leapin' Lanny Poffo (brother of the more well-known \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage), and together they won the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship from Gypsy Joe and Leroy Rochester. It was Eaton's first title win, and he and Poffo held it for a little over a month. Eaton went on to form a team, known as The Jet Set, with George Gulas, Nick Gulas's son. Together, Eaton and Gulas held the tag team title three times. During their time as a team, the two were involved in a storyline feud with Terry Gordy and Michael Hayes before Gordy and Hayes became famous under the name The Fabulous Freebirds. Bobby Eaton in 1979 In the spring of 1979, Eaton started a feud with Chris Colt, designed to establish Eaton as more than just a good tag team competitor. The feud between the two was so heated that it saw Colt suspended for piledriving Eaton on the concrete floor, making it appear Eaton had been seriously injured. Eaton suffered no injuries, however. At that time, the piledriver was banned in most federations and treated as a move that could potentially paralyze a wrestler. This was done to give the move more \\"shock value\\". Eaton conclusively defeated Colt, earning a place as one of the top faces (good guys) in NWA Mid-America. During 1979 and 1980, Eaton worked a series of singles matches against Dennis Condrey, a man he would later team up with to gain worldwide fame. At the end of 1979, Eaton turned heel (bad guy) for the first time in his career by joining Tojo Yamamoto's group of wrestlers, whom the fans hated. Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were surprised at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by The Blond Bombers (Larry Latham and Wayne Ferris) to return to the fan-favorite side once more. After reuniting the team, Eaton and Gulas had one final run with tag team champions and worked an intense feud with Latham and Ferris. =Continental Wrestling Association (1980‚Äì1983)= When Nick Gulas' wrestling promotion closed due to dwindling ticket sales, Eaton briefly wrestled for Georgia Championship Wrestling, even capturing the National Television Championship. Before long Eaton returned closer to home, working for promoter Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), which was centered in Memphis, Tennessee. During his early days in the promotion, Eaton faced Stan Lane several times in tag team competition. Eaton's most successful partnership in the CWA, in terms of title wins, was with Sweet Brown Sugar, nicknamed \\"the New Wave\\". The two wrestlers blended their athleticism and high flying abilities to form a very successful team. The New Wave held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship three times (twice with manager Jimmy Hart in their corner). After achieving success as a tag team, it was decided that Eaton and Sugar should split up and feud with each other. This storyline resulted in Eaton \\"forcing\\" Sugar out of the promotion after he won a \\"Losers Leaves Town\\" match against Sugar. Sugar's disappearance was soon followed by the appearance of a masked man called Stagger Lee, who looked and wrestled like Sugar. The storyline of Sugar returning under the mask to fight the heels helped make the masked man instantly popular with the crowd. Eaton, along with the rest of Jimmy Hart's stable \\"the First Family\\", tried in vain to unmask Stagger Lee. Eaton turned face and re-teamed with Sugar, although they maintained the storyline that Eaton's partner was actually \\"Stagger Lee\\" and not Sugar. The team regained the tag team title before losing it to The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). Afterward, Eaton teamed up with The Moondogs (Rex and Spot) to face Jerry Lawler and the Fabulous Ones. During the match, one of the Moondogs accidentally hit Eaton with their trademark bone, costing their side the match. After the match ended, the Moondogs, as well as Jimmy Hart, turned on Eaton, beating him down until he was saved by Stagger Lee. =Mid-South Wrestling and World Class Championship Wrestling (1983‚Äì1985)= Soon after Eaton joined Mid-South Wrestling under promoter Bill Watts, he became part of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of Jim Cornette to form a new version of the tag team. The Express had previously been a group of wrestlers consisting of Condrey, Randy Rose and Norvell Austin, but with Eaton's arrival, the Midnight Express worked exclusively as a two-man team. To complement the nickname \\"Lover Boy\\" Dennis, Eaton was nicknamed \\"Beautiful\\" Bobby, a nickname he still uses when wrestling. At first, The Express was booked in an angle with the Mid-South Tag Team Champions Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey tarring and feathering Magnum T.A. in the middle of the ring. The Express first won the tag team title when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum T.A., attacking him during the title match and allowing Eaton and Condrey to win the title without much opposition. With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. They began a long series of matches against The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the United States still book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started. The Midnight Express had a short stay in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas, where they feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). =Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1985-1993)= The Midnight Express (1985‚Äì1990) In 1985 Eaton, Condrey and Cornette signed with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) and were given national exposure on JCP's televised programs on SuperStation TBS. Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the NWA World Tag team title from them in February 1986 during Superstars on the Superstation. During the course of their heated angle, Eaton and Condrey re-lost the title to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later. Eaton and Condrey also had long running feuds with The New Breed (Chris Champion and Sean Royal) as well as The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high-profile Scaffold match at Starrcade 1986, which the Midnight Express lost. In early 1987, Condrey left JCP for undisclosed reasons, and \\"Sweet\\" Stan Lane took his place as part of the Midnight Express. In May 1987, after teaming for only a few months, Eaton and Lane became champions when they won the NWA United States Tag team title for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together. A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels, as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team Title from Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard on September 10, 1988. This feud was cut short when Anderson & Blanchard signed with the WWF over money issues. The Midnight Express' run with the title lasted a little over a month-and-a- half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up, which saw the heel Road Warriors brutalize the now-popular Midnight Express. Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which consisted of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short. The Midnight Express then turned their attention to Paul E.'s new team, The Samoan S.W.A.T. Team as well as a new version of The Fabulous Freebirds. Eaton and Lane were defeated by the Freebirds in the finals of a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Titles. Following this loss, the Midnight Express teamed with their former enemies The Road Warriors and \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams to defeat the SST and the Freebirds in a WarGames match at The Great American Bash. Following this feud, Lane and Eaton began having issues with a young new team in the NWA known as \\"the Dynamic Dudes\\" (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace). The Dudes admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed to manage the young team, to the displeasure of the Midnight Express. After arguing with the Express, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying Eaton and Lane to the ring, choosing to only actively manage the Dudes. At Clash of Champions IX, the two teams met with Jim Cornette appearing in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites, and when the night was over, the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express. After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a storyline with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team title. The Express won the title from the young team in early 1990, but lost the belts to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. After a loss at the WCW pay-per-view Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up, as Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation, while Eaton chose to remain in WCW. For the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express. World Television Champion (1991) For the first time since 1979, Eaton was a singles competitor, and he faced an uphill struggle to establish himself. He wrestled his former opponents in tag team competition such as Brad Armstrong (whom he defeated at WrestleWar '91), Ricky Morton and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk (whom he defeated at Starrcade '90, but lost to at Clash of the Champions XIV), but it was not until he turned face during the early parts of 1991 that he started to move up the rankings. Per a Wrestling Observer Newsletter report, Eaton signed a two-year contract worth $170,000 a year in January 1991. At SuperBrawl I, Eaton defeated Arn Anderson to win the World Television Championship. Eaton's highest profile match as a singles wrestler came when he faced off against the World Heavyweight Champion \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair at Clash of the Champions XV in a two-out-of-three falls match. Eaton pinned Flair in the first fall, but ultimately lost to Flair two falls to one. His World Television Championship reign was short-lived, as he came face to face with newcomer \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin, who cheated his way to win the title from Eaton. The Dangerous Alliance (1991‚Äì1992) Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously formed the faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton joined the group when he assisted Rick Rude, with the storyline being that Dangerously had brought Rude to WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and held on to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers. The Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW. At one point during 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy Sting. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double-ring War Games match at WrestleWar 1992. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod. This match would be given a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. In the aftermath of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)= When Eaton found himself without a job, he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette. Cornette had started his own wrestling federation, Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) and welcomed Eaton with open arms. Eaton joined up with \\"The Heavenly Bodies\\" (Stan Lane and Tom Prichard), and the three were booked as the top heels of the federation for a while. Eaton also won the federation's version of the TV title, known as the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1993‚Äì1995)= Eaton first toured through Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling in May 1993 during their Explosion Tour, teaming with Tony Halme and in various tag team matches, facing teams such as Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh, Manabu Nakanishi and Masa Saito, Shinya Hashimoto and Michiyoshi Ohara, Riki Choshu and Takayuki Iizuka and even Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior, known as the Hellraisers, with the latter putting their IWGP Tag Team Championships on the line on June 14, in which Eaton and Halme lost. In January 1994, Eaton went back to Japan during their Fighting Spirit tour, wrestling only in tag team matches (with the exception of a singles match against Black Cat and another against Power Warrior) teaming with Rambo and Mike Enos. In November 1995 during their NJPW/WCW World in Japan tour, Eaton, now under the \\"Earl Robert Eaton\\" character, toured with New Japan for the last time, wrestling only two tag team matches in two days, teaming with Johnny B. Badd (the announcers mistakingly and constantly referred him as Bobby instead of Robert) in a losing effort against the Ookami Gundan (Masahiro Chono and Hiroyoshi Tenzan) and another losing effort alongside Lord Steven Regal against Kensuke Sasaki and Osamu Nishimura. =Return to WCW (1993-2000)= Tag teams and singles appearances (1993‚Äì1995) When Bill Watts was ousted from his position in WCW in favor of Eric Bischoff in 1993, Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young Chris Benoit in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to help establish rising teams or give established teams opposition. After Benoit left to return to Japan, in Eaton's next venture in tag teaming, under the name \\"Bad Attitude\\", he teamed up with Steve Keirn, formerly of the Fabulous Ones. Bad Attitude's single noteworthy moment together came when they were present as Arn Anderson turned on tag team partner Dustin Rhodes. Otherwise, the team did not get much exposure. During this time, Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW. His most well-known appearance was at the When Worlds Collide show on May 14, 1994, where he teamed with Sabu to beat Arn Anderson and Terry Funk. The Blue Bloods (1995‚Äì1996) After Bad Attitude quietly ended, Eaton was placed with British snob \\"Lord\\" Steven Regal. A series of vignettes followed, in which Regal educated Eaton on how to be a man of class and sophistication. The Blue Bloods initially feuded with the Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), their complete opposites in terms of \\"sophistication\\" and presentation. They also feuded with Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) over the World Tag Team Championship, but never took the belts, and engaged in a short \\"Snobs versus Rednecks\\" program with the Stud Stable (Bunkhouse Buck and Dick Slater). In all of 1996 the team members made only one pay-per-view (PPV) appearance, as individuals in the \\"Lethal Lottery\\" during May's Slamboree. Later that year, Regal won the World Television Championship. Not long after, Eaton was moved out of the group, turning on his partners, wrestling Regal for the television championship on two occasions. Final years and departure (1996‚Äì2000) The Blue Bloods storyline represented the last serious push that Eaton was given by the WCW booking team. After the run with Regal and Taylor ended, Eaton wrestled mainly on WCW's weekend show, Saturday Night, occasionally winning against wrestlers low in the rankings and losing to wrestlers above him. =Independent circuit (2000‚Äì2015)= In 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic, forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Ricky Nelson. This Midnight Express version was very short-lived, and Eaton instead began touring with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Stan Lane) as the Midnight Express. This version of the Midnight Express performed together on select independent wrestling cards in the United States until 2012 when Eaton worked his last match. Eaton made a one night only appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on August 13, 2003, as a part of a Kid Kash storyline where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s wrestling stars such as Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Morton. Eaton lost to Kid Kash in his only TNA appearance to date. On October 23, 2015, Eaton wrestled his last match of his nearly 40-year career, losing to Ricky Morton, also ending the 30-plus year feud between The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Midnight Express. Personal life =Reputation= Eaton is often regarded as one of the nicest people in the wrestling business, even though he wrestled as a heel for a majority of his career. In his 1999 book Have a Nice Day, Mick Foley praised Eaton as being one of the most underrated superstars in the business, and its nicest, commenting that \\"it was damn near impossible to pay for anything with Bobby around, though I will confess to not trying that hard\\". His generosity was not limited to picking up tabs, either: Jim Cornette and Sean Waltman have noted that Eaton would regularly travel with an extra suitcase filled with toiletries, socks, and other oft-forgotten items that he would give to anyone who needed them. This opinion was supported in The Stone Cold Truth by Steve Austin. In addition to his personality, he is also popular with other wrestlers due to his wrestling style. Wrestling Eaton is known as \\"a night off\\", because Eaton is so skilled that the action looks very convincing but does not hurt the opponent. =Family= Eaton is married to Bill Dundee's daughter, Donna. When they first started dating, they had to keep the relationship secret from her father, as her father had forbidden her from dating the wrestlers he was booking. When Dundee found out she was dating Eaton, he relented because Eaton was such a nice guy. Eaton and Donna have three children: Dustin, Dylan, and Taryn. Dylan is a professional wrestler. =Health= In September 2006 it was reported that Eaton was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. Later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement saying that he did not have a heart attack but was diagnosed with high blood pressure with a hint of diabetes. Since then, he has suffered with several health issues, especially cardiac problems which have seen him hospitalized on several occasions. In June 2013, Eaton underwent successful surgery to have a pacemaker inserted. On August 5, 2016, Eaton was reported missing by his sister Debbie. According to Tommy Dreamer, Eaton was last seen in Atlanta, where a photo, which has since been deleted, showed him eating at the airport, had no phone, and was confused. A day later, Eaton was found safe. Wrestler Matt Sigmon posted a photo on his Twitter account of himself and Bobby Eaton.

In 2005, it became the first English-language track to ever be allowed on RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta, the Republic of Ireland Irish-language radio station, after having been selected by listeners for the event. In media The song was also featured prominently in the 1997 film Grosse Pointe Blank. John Cusack had initially requested an updated version of the song, which led to the band recording a new, slower arrangement that featured saxophones, strings and other instruments. This version of the song was dubbed \\"Blister 2000.\\" However, Cusack eventually decided he wanted to include the original version of the song as well. Because the original master tapes of the band's debut album had long been disposed of, they decided to record a new version of the original 1983 arrangement. Neither of these rerecorded versions appears in the actual film, although a new music video, directed by Evan Bernard, was created for the new recording of the 1983 arrangement. It features Gordon Gano as a deranged assassin trying to kill Socks the cat in puppet form, interspersed with clips from the film. In August 2007, Gordon Gano was the subject of a lawsuit brought by bassist Brian Ritchie. The lawsuit stems partly from Gano's authorization of the use of \\"Blister\\" in a Wendy's commercial.

It can be considered a special type of chorizo. It is made of minced pork, or a mixture of minced pork and beef, is encased in either lamb tripe or plastic and has a fat content that varies between 70 and 80%. The sausage is flavoured with garlic, salt and paprika, which gives it a bright-red colour. It is usually baked, fried or grilled and often accompanies other dishes, sometimes as part of tapas. The final cured product tends to be thinner than traditional chorizo or sausage, with a diameter of approximately 25 mm. The sausages average in length, though there are cases when they reach up to long. In the Aragonese Pyrenees, there are two different types of chistorra: one made only of pork meat and another made of lungs, boned pig head and the pancreas, called berica. The local variety of chistorra available in the province of Le√≥n is called Chistorra de Le√≥n and is made with a larger percentage of beef. Preparations One of the most popular dishes involving chistorra is huevos rotos con chistorra y patatas, a dish with fried eggs and potatoes. Chistorra is usually fried whole, but served chopped into smaller sections as a tapa. Fried chistorra is often accompanied by beer or wine, especially of the Txakoli variety. Fried chistorra is also a typical bocadillo (sandwich) filler (bocadillo de chistorra). Other common dishes include croissant pre√±ado, a croissant with chistorra filler, and tortilla con chistorra, a potato or egg omelet with chistorra. Chistorra is traditionally served on the feast day of Thomas the Apostle (December 21) in San Sebasti√°n. During the festivities, chistorra is often served alongside talo and is accompanied by cider.

The station was founded in 1931 by Clarence W. Jones, Reuben Larson, and D. Stuart Clark.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/HCJB.html HCJB now focuses on Ecuador with unified programming on FM at 89.3 MHz in Pichincha, at 92.5 MHz in Manab√≠, at 96.1 MHz in Tungurahua and Cotopaxi, at 98.3 MHz in Esmeraldas and with separate programming on AM at 690 kHz.Programming schedule (in Spanish) Broadcasts in Spanish and indigenous languages on 6050 kHz (1 kW), continue on an intermittent basis with a new solid state transmitter which in 2017 replaced an older (5 kW) transmitter. These broadcasts were not listed on the HCJB English website as of February 2016.  History  Radio station HCJB started as the vision of Clarence Wesley Jones (1900‚Äì1986),Billy Graham Center Archives ‚Äì Papers of Clarence Wesley Jones ‚Äì Collection 349 a musician, graduate of Moody Bible Institute, and the son of a Salvation Army minister. Following his graduation from Moody, Jones worked under evangelist Paul Rader and was part of the founding staff of the Chicago Gospel Tabernacle where Jones assisted in leading music, working with youth and overseeing Rader's weekly radio ministry called \\"WJBT\\" (Where Jesus Blesses Thousands)Come Up To This Mountain, Neely, Lois - Tyndale Publishers, 1980 Impressed by the impact Rader's radio ministry had made, Jones felt called to establish missionary radio in Latin America. As a result, Jones traveled to Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Cuba on a seven-week trip in 1928 looking for a suitable location for his envisioned radio station, but was unable to obtain the necessary government permits. Back in Chicago nearly two years later, Jones met Christian & Missionary Alliance (CMA) missionaries from Ecuador - Reuben and Grace Larson, John and Ruth Clark and Paul and Bernice Young. These missionaries encouraged Jones to consider Ecuador as the place to start his missionary radio station. As the first step in fulfilling his vision, Jones needed to obtain a contract of approval from the Ecuadorian government for setting up the radio station. Reuben Larson and D. Stuart Clark, along with Ecuadorian lawyer Lu√≠s Calisto, worked to procure the initial contract. On August 15, 1930, the Ecuadorian Congress approved a bill which granted Jones a 25-year contract to operate a radio station in the country. As with all countries having a governing body over broadcast operations, the call letters HCJB were obtained through the government of Ecuador, beginning with the internationally allocated prefix for Ecuador's broadcast stations (HC). Station co-founders Jones and Larson advocated for, and were granted by the government, call letters that were an acronym indicative of the stations' agreed upon purpose. The result was Heralding Christ Jesus' Blessings. In Spanish (one of the original broadcast languages of the South American station) the call letters represent Hoy Cristo Jes√∫s Bendice. Jones incorporated the World Radio Missionary Fellowship, Inc. (WRMF) on March 9, 1931 as a non-profit entity and overseeing organization over HCJB. Jones was also the non-profit corporation's first president. The corporation's first officers were Adam Welty as treasurer, Ruth Churchill, secretary, and Lance Latham and his wife, Virginia, along with Howard Jones and Reuben Larson serving on the board of directors. HCJB's first broadcast on Christmas Day, 1931 had the potential of being heard by the six radio receivers capable of receiving the program and existing in the country at the time.Raidio.com NewsArchive article on HCJB The inaugural program was broadcast in English and Spanish from a studio in the Joneses' living room and powered by a 200-watt, table-top transmitter. The antenna used was a simple, single wire antenna strung between two makeshift telephone poles. The broadcast lasted 30 minutes.Preparing the Soil for Global Revival: Station HCJB's Radio Circle, 1949-59; Timothy H.B. Stomenman - March 2007 Frequencies, QSLs, and programming The grounds of radio station HCJB in Quito, Ecuador Initially, HCJB only broadcast programs in English and Spanish. In 1941, however, live programs were added in Russian, Swedish and Quichua. By 1944, the station had aired programming in 14 languages including live programs in Czech, Dutch, French and German. Programs in languages such as Arabic, Italian and Hebrew were recorded elsewhere and sent to Quito on large acetate coated aluminium transcription discs. By 1967, live programming would be added in Portuguese and Japanese. Following the first years of HCJB's broadcasts on 50.26 meters (5986 kHz), the shortwave frequencies utilized by HCJB for its broadcasts from Quito were 6050 kHz, 9745 kHz, 11775 kHz and 15155 kHz.Shortwave DX frequency guide As the station's transmitting power increased, shortwave radio enthusiasts in North America started receiving the station's broadcasts, submitting reception reports in order to provide the HCJB engineers feedback on the station's signal strength and quality.An HCJB envelope with a 1938 postmark which contained a QSL card sent to the addressee Since a popular practice in the hobby of shortwave radio listening was to request a QSL card, HCJB started creating its own QSLs in 1932.By the 1970s, the station was one of the most powerful and most readily received shortwave stations. HCJB was heard around the world and received hundreds of letters each week with reception reports from shortwave DXers. The correspondence department of HCJB would respond in kind to its listeners with QSL cards and Christian tracts.As requests for QSLs became more frequent, HCJB missionary and radio engineer Clayton Howard suggested a shortwave listeners' club be created. In 1974, the Andes DXers International, (or \\"ANDEX\\") began. Members would receive a membership certificate and membership card with the member's name and individual member number, along with Howard's signature. A monthly bulletin, (later bi-monthly) was sent to members.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/ANDEX/ANDEX.html ANDEX eventually had a membership in the thousands and continued as a service of HCJB until 1996. Since the station's first year of broadcasting, staff members produced the HCJB's own original radio programming.HCJB's original programming has ranged from programs completely in Quichua (the primary language of the people of the Andes), Andean-music programs, Christian music programming, talk and mail-reading programs featuring mail received from listeners around the world, Bible study and teaching programs, and programming featuring information about shortwave radio listening.Some of the most popular HCJB-produced programs over the years have been \\"Morning in the Mountains,\\" \\"Musica del Ecuador\\", \\"Musical Mailbag,\\" \\"Happiness Is\\" and \\"DX-Partyline.\\" \\"DX-Partyline\\" was hosted from its inception by HCJB missionary Clayton Howard and his wife, Helen. The program was heard for more than 40 years, twice a week, and included the reading of letters from shortwave listeners around the world as well as DX and reception reports sent to the station. \\"DX-Partyline\\" also included shortwave radio listening tips, information on antennas, and equipment reviews. Programs not produced by HCJB were also broadcast from the Quito station.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/Literature/Newscript-Aug-1941.pdf Typically of a religious nature, some of the non-HCJB produced programs broadcast from the station were the Pacific Garden Mission's \\"Unshackled!\\", the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's Hour of Decision, the Salvation Army's \\"Wonderful Words of Life\\" and Moody Bible Institute radio station WMBI's \\"Nightsounds\\" with Bill Pearce,Nightsounds with Bill Pearce - Easy Listening for Hard Times among many others. Much of HCJB's original programming also included music recorded, produced and performed by HCJB missionaries.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/Literature/The_Radio_Missionary_Log-1945.pdf Much of the HCJB-produced music broadcast on the station was also available on LP record albums and later on cassette tapes. In December 1995, Radio Netherlands the Media Network programme visited the transmitter site at Pifo with two members of the HCJB production team. The programme can be found in the Media Network vintage vault. https://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/mn- Milestones and achievements 1931 - The station's first broadcast using a 200-watt transmitter designed and built by HCJB Engineer Eric Williams.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/Literature/HCJB-25_Yrs_of_Progress-1956.pdf * 1936 - An RCA medium-wave transmitter is added. * 1937 - The addition of a 1,000 watt transmitter designed and built by HCJB Engineer Victoriano Salvador. * 1940 - The station adds a 10,000 watt transmitter designed and built by HCJB Engineer Clarence C.

The station used a portable FM transmitter designed and built by staff at the HCJB Engineering Center. HCJB Global Technology staff members are involved in research, development, training and technical support for AM, FM and shortwave radio stations as well as satellite distribution and satellite-based Internet services. In recent years they developed station automation systems and a fixed-tuned, solar-powered SonSet radio that can be pretuned to pick up a specific Christian radio station. HCJB Global staff have been active in pioneering equipment and software for a form of digital radio broadcasting called DRM. End of a broadcasting era HCJB's steerable \\"mixer-antenna\\" in Pifo, Ecuador After nearly 80 years of shortwave broadcasting from Ecuador, Radio Station HCJB ended the remaining regional shortwave transmissions on September 30, 2009.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/HCJB/Articles/From_Ecuador_to_the_World-2009.pdf The international transmitter site in Pifo was dismantled to make way for the city of Quito's new airport. According to HCJB Global President Wayne Pederson, the change was made because, ‚Äúthe way people consume media has changed, so we have the opportunity to change to delivery systems such as satellite, AM/FM and the Internet. The closing of shortwave in Latin America is strategic because of the planting of local radio stations across the region and around the world. These stations are staffed and programmed by local Christians who can speak to the culture in their own communities.‚ÄùHCJB Global Voice Moves Up End Date of Shortwave Broadcasts from Ecuador HCJB Global's focus is now on ‚Äúradio planting‚Äù‚Äîassisting local Christian ministries in beginning implementing their own Christian radio ministry. Worldwide, more than 350 local stations have been assisted in this type of endeavor, including nearly 60 stations in Latin America alone. Although the historic station and transmitter sites in Ecuador will no longer operate on the shortwave bands, Shortwave broadcasts continue from HCJB Global Australia's site in Kununurra,Register of Radiocommunications Licences Australia and from commercial broadcast sites and partner ministry broadcast sites around the world.

They play their home games on \\"Dominico Field\\" at Christie Pits. They are also known colloquially as the Intercounty Maple Leafs or the Intercounty Leafs to disambiguate themselves from the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. History The Maple Leafs baseball team began play in 1969, the second season after the original Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the AAA International League moved to Louisville, Kentucky. In their inaugural year, the new Leafs lost 23 games, finishing 18 games out of first place. But they have never ended a season that far back since then. They have been in first place 19 times in the subsequent years and have the best winning percentage of any active team in the League. The team was owned by husband and wife Jack and Lynne Dominico for the first 40 years of its existence, but has since been owned exclusively by Jack after Lynne's passing on November 8, 2008. The Intercounty Baseball League Championship is also named in their honour, the Jack and Lynne Dominico Trophy. Championships Since its inception the team has won the Jack and Lynne Dominico Trophy as Intercounty Baseball champions eight times, the first in 1972. During the 2002 season, the Leafs were undefeated at home, a first for the league. They also won the championship that year. They have also achieved many individual awards and All-Star nominations. *Championships (8): 1972, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2007 =Former Players= Former Major League Baseball player Pete Orr once played for the Intercounty Leafs as did former Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Rich Butler (2001‚Äì2002).

It was founded in the 1940s on the site of a former farm known as Supio's farm, offering new housing for returning GIs and their families. Overbrook Park remains a stable, safe, African-American middle-class neighborhood. Boundaries Overbrook Park is bounded by Overbrook to the east, Penn Wynne to the north, Upper Darby to the south and west, and Havertown to the west. The main artery is Haverford Avenue which goes into Penn Wynne across City Avenue where it becomes Haverford Road. Haverford Avenue and 75th Street connect it to Lansdowne Avenue on the Overbrook side, which continues south through Upper Darby where it becomes State Road. Haverford Avenue, 76th Street, and 77th Street connect it to City Avenue on the Penn Wynne side. The neighborhood spans for approximately four city blocks west to east along City Avenue, and approximately ten smaller blocks north to south on either side of 76th Street. Overbrook Park has a public school named after Robert Eneas Lamberton, a former Republican mayor of Philadelphia. It was once a K‚Äì12 school and the only one of its kind in Philadelphia. Today it is a K-8 school. Lamberton School is located at 75th Street and Woodbine Avenue. Population Overbrook Park used to have a large Jewish population. There was an Orthodox and a Conservative synagogue. Most of the Jews have moved across City Avenue (U.S. 1) into neighboring Penn Wynne in Lower Merion Township. The Jewish community of both sides of the border are considered to be one unit and are connected by an eruv, a wire attached to the telephone and electric poles which allows religious Jews to carry things on Shabbat. The Orthodox Congregation Beth Hamedrosh was founded in the late 1950s as a branch of Beth Hamedrosh HaGadol in West Philadelphia. The congregation moved to Penn Wynne in May 2007, after having purchased the site in 2000. The Building that housed Beth Hamedrosh is now Temple Kefarym, a Black Hebrew congregation which is now boarded up following a fire. The Conservative Congregation Beth T'fillah, originally called Overbrook Park Congregation founded in 1948, closed down in the Fall of 2006 and merged with Temple Adath Israel in Merion, Lower Merion Township due to a lack of sufficient membership. The building that housed Beth T'fillah is now Overbrook Park Church of Christ. In 1990, Overbrook Park had some 7,200 residents, mostly of Jewish, Italian and Irish origins. During the mid-1990s, the neighborhood started to become majority African American. By 2000, the neighborhood's population had become nearly 60% African American. Today it is approximately 81% African American Despite the demographic change, there are still several kosher establishments in Overbrook Park, among them a kosher fish and produce store, a kosher bagel store, a kosher pizzeria, and a kosher bakery. As of late 2015 a new kosher sushi restaurant opened on Haverford Ave, but has since closed. In 2017, Chabad of Penn Wynne and Congregation Beth Hamedrosh, formerly of Overbrook Park, were awarded a grant by The Kohelet Foundation to assist with promoting Overbrook Park as an affordable neighborhood for young Jewish families. Starting with Rosh Hashana in September 2020, Chabad of Penn Wynne is now located in Overbrook Park in the same shopping center that is home to New York Bagels and R&R; Produce and Fish. It was previously located at the Kaiserman JCC across City Line Avenue but had to relocate due to the coronavirus pandemic. After 13 years with no synagogue, Overbrook Park again has a synagogue. Overbrook Park is the birthplace of actor Seth Green. You can also find traditional Philadelphia Hoagies at Ferrante's Meats and More and cheese steaks at Stacy's Pizza.

It is the largest and the first port area of Portugal and the main city industrial port logistics in Portugal and the birthplace of fifteenth-century explorer Vasco da Gama. It is the seat of a municipality with 203.30 km ¬≤ of area and 18,598 inhabitants (2015 INE), divided into two parishes. The municipality is bordered to the north and east by the municipality of Santiago do Cac√©m, south and west by Odemira has coastline on the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline of the city, south of S√£o Torpes, is one part of the natural parks of Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park. History The ancient centre of Sines: the castle was initiated as protection from pirates in 1362 Vestiges of a few settlements have today been discovered in archaeological sites, such as Palmeirinha and Quit√©ria, that attest to the age of human settlements in Sines.Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1981 Arnaldo Soledade (1981) noted that these Visigoths, identified as Cinetos, may have been the original civilization that gave rise to the community, suggesting the local toponymy may have derived from this; Cinetos, to Cines and, finally, Sines.Arnaldo Soledade, 1981 Although this tribes lineage is not clearly defined, Soledade goes on to refer to the construction of a castro where the current Castle stands. The Punics are thought to have also had a presence in the area; a Punic artifact, the Tesouro do Gaio was unearthed in 1966, and is on display in the Museu de Sines (). Discovered in May 1966, the 'treasure' was unearthed by a local farmer, Francisco da Silva Campos, who was tilling his land to plant corn, and discovered a schist tomb with women's jewellery in his plot of land in Herdade do Gaio (12.5 km southeast of Sines, 7 km from the coast and 275m from Ribeira de Morgavel). Between 1966 and 1967, investigator Jos√© Miguel da Costa discovered several of these Punic graves, but all showing evidence of early tomb raiding. While the jewellery was determined to be Punic in origin, the symbolism on the artefacts were characterized as Egyptian.Some earrings show the figure of Hathor and a signet of marble, amulet, is engraved in relief with a scarab associated with Thutmose III, with the eye of Horus, the Son God. On the island of Pessegueiro, there is also evidence of Ibero-Punic artefacts discovered under the Roman port, discovered by archeologists Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981).Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1993 Roman occupation brought the destruction of many of these artefacts associated with the Iron Age. The Romans used Sines as a port and industrial centre; the bay of Sines was used as port by the civitas of Mir√≥briga and the canal on the island of Pessegueiro is linked to Arandis (Garv√£o). During Rome's occupation, Sines and the island of Pessegueiro, were poles within an industrialized fishing industry which included salting fish. The Roman centres were thought to have been at Pra√ßa T√≥mas Ribeiro, as well as the area around Monte Chaos in Feteira Cima (although little explored archaeologically). In the fields of Quit√©ria, Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares (1981) investigated the remains of a 1st-century villa, where the remnants of cobblestone streets and a hypocaust were discovered. In 1961, Jos√© Miguel da Costa, during excavations around the Castle of Sines, discovered Roman \\"fishing factories\\", and a ceramics kiln to produce amphorae for salted fish, both dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries. Sine's toponymy is also Roman in origin, but may refer to two terms (both applicable): the term sinus, which means bay; or an alternate meaning for curve, and may refer to the curvature of the Sines Cape, as seen from Monte Ch√£os. Middle Ages Battlements along the south wall of the Castle of Sines The Revelim Fort, the 17th Century fort used for the protection from pirates The old quarter of Sines, showing an example of the older architecture During the Middle Ages, the area of Sines was occupied by the Visigoths and later sacked by Moors. There are many more examples of Visigoth-era carved stones (7th century) throughout Sines.Fernando Almeida, 1970 Evidence from an archaeological excavation of the Sines castle discovered that many of the walls of the old building were constructed from the rocks used in the construction of Roman-era monuments, such as a portion of a pedestal of a statue of Mars (which was assumed to have been part of a larger square in the Roman town before the construction of the basilica).Jos√© d¬¥Encarna√ß√£o, 2009 The basilica itself likely existed on the site of the current Matriz Church, whose baptistery is of Visigothic origin. The Moors likely sacked the settlement in the 7th century; this marked a period of decline in the area, indicating a period when the ancient settlement was abandoned. Yet, although the few inhabitants lived in the zone, Moorish ships regularly patrolled the waters, until the 13th century, when Afonso III conquered the region. The area regained much of its importance at the beginning of the 8th century, when fishermen returned to the waters around Sines. Re-settlement along the coast was initiated by the Order of Santiago da Espada, who administered the lands under the reign of Afonso III. Sines obtained administrative autonomy from Santiago do Cac√©m on 24 November 1362, when Pedro I elevated Sines to the status of villa. He later preoccupied himself with the coastal defense of the region, establishing the conditions for the construction of Sine's Castle, already protected by elements of the Visigothic wall. The castle in Sines was constructed during the first half of the 15th century. Like Set√∫bal, but contrary to what happened in Santiago do Cac√©m or Palmela, the castle was constructed to defend the wealth of the local merchants, indicating a new economic and social order, with the ascension of the bourgeoisie.Carlos Tavares da Silva and Joaquina Soares, 1998, p.21-44 Monarchy During the Portuguese Interregnum and 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis, the bourgeoisie and nobles of Sines were one of the municipalities that supported the Master of the Order of Aviz, the later King John I of Portugal in his battle for the throne. In 1395, aggravated by the fact the castle was not completed, King John appropriated men to serve in the military campaigns along the frontier. But, much of the concern during this period was from attacks by pirates, and compulsory military service was seen as bulwark against the region's collapse. In 1511, Sines was attacked by a large band of pirates. The King, who was careful to indemnity the losses, established a small base of three ships in Sines and Sesimbra to combat these French privateers. By the end of the 16th century, as threats from the coast increased, so too were the fortifications along the coast. This included the establishment of a fort alongside the Chapel of Senhora das Salas (Fort of Revelim), and two forts on the island of Pessegueiro. In 1629, as the construction of the Revelim Fort proceeded, Turkish pirates attacked and sank a nau in the port of Sines. A Sesimbrense captain, though, was successful in capturing a pirate ship in the bay by 1648. At the end of the 16th century, commanded by Filippo Terzi, in the service of Philip II of Portugal, it was thought that the construction of a new port on Pessegueiro would motivate growth. Problems during construction, and frequent raids by English privateers, caused the project to be abandoned: the remnants on Pessegueiro include great blocks of rock that were quarried to make way for the project. In the last decade of the 18th century, the natural anchorage seduced Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, a merchant, to found Porto Covo, with the hope that his initiative would convince others to establish complementary businesses and a grand port. In the second half of the 19th century, pyrite from Pias and Moinho dos Paneiros (Sines) and ore from Cercal are transported from the small island. The ore arrived in carts pulled by bulls, transported over a large bridge, and by boats to larger ships on the island. Near the mouth of the ravine on Pessegueiro there still remain abandoned deposits of accumulated ore, that were never transported. During the first decade of the 19th century, the populous of Sines lived in fear during the French occupation of the country. In one incident, a company of troops from Napoleon's army pillaged the town and defaced the royal coat-of-arms over the doors to the castle. Under the Liberalist Constitution, the municipality began to govern its own affairs, as the Order of Santiago, along with other religious orders were expelled from Portugal in 1855, and most of their assets appropriated. Sines became a parish of Santiago do Cac√©m, losing autonomy, yet flourished economically as several new businesses began operating from the town. The establishment of cork and canning industries, small factories producing distillates and artisan goods (bakeries and cobblers), turned the village more attractive to emigrants. The town attracted many English and Catalan businesses, as well as Alentejan and Algarvan entrepreneurs in search of work. Entrepreneurial growth and republican idealism helped to redevelop the area, as the construction of new roads, the arrival of a rail-line, access to schools and culture became cumulative. The new elites, not only built their wealth on land rental, but also industry and commerce, and showed renewed interest in restoring the municipality. These liberal elites, such as Jo√£o Daniel de Sines, fought for the constitutional monarchy during the Liberal Wars, and were magnanimous when former-King Miguel of Portugal stopped-over in their region on his way to exile. At the end of the 19th century, a young Algarvian medic would write the first monograph on Sines, Breve Not√≠cia de Sines (). Francisco Lu√≠s Lopes' work was an acidic critique of municipal affairs and living conditions that were both sincere and damning, but also flattering and praise-worthy, noting both the villa's problems and its openness and tolerance.Francisco Lu√≠s Lopes, 1850 Republic The year 1914 marked a period of renewed interest and the restoration of the municipality. The cork industry, the fishery, some agriculture and tourism marked a period of economic activity that lasted until the end of the 1960s, when, apart from its proximity to the sea, Sines was indistinguishable from other communities in the Alentejo. Sines was the beach for many of the local residents of the Alentejo, visited by the rural families of Beja and Santiago do Cac√©m. Until the early 1970s, Sines was a sheltered fishing village with a long commercial history of relations with cities in the Mediterranean; its large marina, along a breakwater, is the only marina between Set√∫bal and the Algarve, while the deep-sea port, commercial fishery and industrial depot have driven the economy of this area. In 1970, the government of Marcello Caetano initiated the grand industrial-port complex that would, along with the 1974 Revolution, energize the local economy. Consequently, the population exploded, while industry and commerce diversified, causing their own impacts. In the late 1970s, the arrival of immigrants and refugees from the Portuguese overseas provinces brought new social dynamics, which were later supplemented by foreign workers employed in the port and petrochemical industry. Geography =Physical geography= The lower coast of the coastal plain that stretches from Sines to Set√∫bal The landscape in the eastern plain, near Porto Covo The municipalities territory is distinguished by three morphological structures: a coastal plain, the residual relief of the Sines Massif, and the eastern escarpment. * The coastal plan (which occupies the major part of the municipality) slopes gradually from the interior and occupies an area of 3-12 kilometres cut by several water courses. * Little remains of the Sines Massif, but from Monte Ch√£os to the Cape, there are elements of its morphology still present: the Sines promontory is relatively elevated from the sea, and limited by an abrupt escarpment, which slopes to the south until the Ribeira da Junqueira., where beaches and dunes predominate. But after the beach of Burrinho, it continues to be rugged until the vicinity of the island Pessegueiro, where beaches are also evident, while sheltered coves and mini-beaches, such as Porto Covinho, are inter-cut along the coastline. From the north of the city the coast is low sandy beach that extends to Tr√≥ia. From this coast, extensive dunes, particularly north of the mouth of Ribeira dos Moinhos dominate the landforms. * The eastern escarpment, which is limited by the coastal plain forms part of the Serra do Cercal Massif (which rises 100‚Äì200 meters in altitude). The coast, which is physically rugged (the Sines Cape) is separated into two differentiated areas: a sandy northern section, and a rocky southern area of cliffs. =Climate= =Human geography= Sines is limited on its southern frontier by Odemira Municipality, north and northeast by Santiago do Cac√©m Municipality, while the southern part of the municipality (south of S√£o Torpes) is part of the Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina (). A small part of the north also belongs to the Reserva Natural da Lagoa de Santo Andr√© e da Sancha (). Sines is 150 kilometers south of Lisbon. Sines Municipality was constituted, until 1485, from the parishes of Sines, Colos and the area that today corresponds to the parish of Vila Nova do Milfontes. In 1485, King D. John II, with the objective of settling the area of coastal Alentejo, created the municipality of Vila Nova de Milfontes, and included the area of Cercal. Colos also became a municipality in 1499, restricting Sines to its present area. In 1855, along with other municipalities, Sines ceased to exist and became integrated into Santiago do Cac√©m as the parish of S√£o Salvador. Although it lost its autonomy, the settlements flourished for a time; Sines regained its autonomy in 1914. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 2 civil parishes (freguesias): * Porto Covo - the tourist- centered parish, along the southern frontier of Sines, settled by Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, to motivate settlement at the end of the 18th century, has grown to include 1400 annual inhabitants; * Sines - the main parish and town within the municipality, with a population of 15000. Not self-governing. Economy The economy of Sines municipality depends on energy, oil refining, port activity, fishing, tourism and trade. The municipality has an important investment park managed by AICEP Global Parques, and a science park, the Sines Tecnopolo. Sines is the location of one of the largest maritime-industrial complexes in Portugal, whose tenants include Sines Power Plant (Electricidade de Portugal), Petrogal Sines (National Petrochemic Refinery) and Repsol (Polymer Refinery). Although rapidly industrializing, the town still preserves many of the historical landmarks and tries to cater to tourism. The nearby village of Porto Covo attracts many tourists owing to its coastline and the well-preserved historical buildings. There is a large shortwave broadcasting station at Sines. The most remarkable antenna towers are the rotatable towers looking like a big \\"V\\". . It was used by Deutsche Welle and was switched off on November 1, 2011. Railways serve the cargo traffic and petroleum industry, but there is no more passenger train service; the city's station has been converted into a restaurant. = Sines Port appointed as 'critical point' for the success of the 'Silk Road' = The Schiller Institute updated its 2014 study on the impact of the Chinese 'New Silk Road' project and considers that the Alentejo port of Sines is a fundamental link for the success of this global initiative. The port is considered by the world's leading experts in the sector as a key link in the global trade liaison project launched in 2013 by the current president of the People's Republic of China, in particular for its special and privileged geostrategic position of connecting the continents of Africa and North and South America. The latest version of the study 'The New Silk Road becomes the world's terrestrial bridge: a shared future for mankind', which updates a first version of 2014 by the Schiller Institute (Germany) considers that the port of Sines is one of the two \\"critical points\\" for the development of this project, due to its more Atlantic vocation, alongside the Spanish port of Algeciras, which is more Mediterranean. \\"Not only Spain, but also Portugal, have eagerly welcomed Xi's proposal and, over the last year, have been actively working on specific proposals and projects to make this a reality,\\" said the Schiller Institute study. However, this situation may have changed in recent weeks, with advantage to Portugal, since Spanish policymakers have not hidden a certain opposition to the growth of Chinese investment in the neighboring country, unlike Portugal, which is to strengthen political, diplomatic and economic relations with the People's Republic of China, as was seen during the past week, with Xi Jinping's official visit to Portugal. During that time, the theme of the port of Sines was certainly at the table of talks at the highest level, as it is well known that several Chinese groups are interested in securing the concession of a new container terminal in Sines, supposedly named Vasco da Gama, and whose public tender is slow to proceed. \\"The Iberian Peninsula is in fact the natural geographical interface of the economic belt of the 'Silk Road', which now stretches from the Pacific to the Atlantic through the land mass of Eurasia, with the 'Silk Sea Route' to the Iberian-American, Caribbean and United States, as well as south towards Africa,\\" says the study of the institute led by Helga and Lindon La Rouche. During the official visit of the president of China this week, Xi Jinping has repeatedly mentioned the interest of the world's second largest economy in investing in and creating business partnerships with Portuguese companies and other entities in the field of port infrastructure and the economy of the sea, among other sectors of activity. Aware of this lively interest of the People's Republic of China in our assets in port infrastructure and the continental shelf, one of the largest in the world, the Minister of the Sea, Ana Paula Vitorino led, about a year ago, an official visit to the Middle Kingdom, with one of the largest business rewards ever - 126 companies. The results of these contacts and talks could soon be known, knowing that China's interest is not limited to the new container terminal in Sines. The Alentejo port, due to its geographical location and natural conditions that allow the large vessels to dock - which continue to grow in size from year to year - has other advantages, including energy, logistics, and other branches of activity. The port of Sines is the largest national port in a busy cargo, with a share of more than 50% of the total Portuguese port sector of the continent. According to data released by the AMT - Mobility and Transport Authority - in the first nine months of this year, the port of Sines handled a total of 36.3 million tonnes of goods. Despite a 6% drop compared to the same period last year, the Alentejo port was responsible for a 51.4% share of the national port sector from January to September, excluding the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira. In the containerized cargo segment, the predominance of the port of Sines is even more evident. Despite a slight fall of 0.1% in the period under review with respect to the number of TEUs (the standard measure equivalent to 20-foot-long containers) moved, the Alentejo port handled a total of nine of 16.5 million tons in this cargo segment, 11% more than in the same period of last year. Thus, the port of Sines accounted for 58.2% of the containerized cargo handled in mainland Portugal during the first three quarters, having been in the top 100 of the world's largest container ports for several years.

He is best known as one of the stars of the reality stunt show Jackass. Career Jackass co-star Johnny Knoxville stated on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart that England has just one testicle as a result of a snowboarding accident. This is shown to be true in a scene from Jackass Number Two in which England attaches a leech to his scrotum. England was once a professional snowboarder and is featured in several of Kingpin Productions' snowboarding videos, including \\"Bulletproof\\" and \\"Back in Black\\". He was founder of the snowboarding magazine Skintight Magazine. He once worked as the field editor for Snowboarder Magazine and was the editor of Blunt magazine, the sister snowboarding magazine to skateboarding's Big Brother. England also appears in the 2008 film Shred, co-starring Tom Green. The film, about a snowboarding school run by England's character, was filmed at Big White, a ski resort in Canada.tomgreen.com - The Channel . =Role in Jackass= England gets involved in stunts and pranks much like the rest of the cast, but he is the first one to participate in something when fecal matter is involved. England proclaimed himself on the Jackass Number Two DVD commentary that he is the \\"world's first professional shitter\\", in as much as he gets paid to defecate on TV. In Jackass 2.5, England jokingly claims that he is the only proven person in the world that is capable of defecating and even vomiting on command, although he finds urinating on command to be difficult. In one stunt on Jackass, England eats a number of uncooked ingredients that he thinks would be suitable for making an omelette. He then forces himself to become sick by eating raw eggs, and proceeds to vomit into a bowl, which he then empties into a pan to fry. Finally, he, very enthusiastically, eats the omelette he has just made. One of England's skits (\\"Poo Diaper\\") almost did not make it to TV. This skit involves England reaching into a garbage can and eating out of a baby's diaper, which contains chocolate pudding. Johnny Knoxville told MTV to keep the skit, and after many debates MTV let Jackass keep \\"Poo Diaper\\". Personal life England has four children. He has a daughter named Ruby (who was born in 2001 and claimed to be present during a stunt performed in the first movie, though off-camera), a son named Roan (born 2004; appears in a deleted interview scene of Jackass 2.5) and another son named Clyde (born 2012). On 21 May 2015, England's fourth child was born, with the name being revealed on his Twitter profile as Van Alexander England. As seen in Jackass 3.5, England skateboards during his spare time.

Biography  An image of Rauf Orbay in naval uniform. H√ºseyin Rauf was born in Constantinople in 1881 to an Abkhazian family. As an officer in the Ottoman Navy, he achieved fame for his actions as the captain of the cruiser Hamidiye during the First Balkan War.Huseyin Ra'uf Orbey, W.M. Hale,The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, ed. C.E.Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.Heinrichs and G. Lecomte, (Brill, 1995), 174. He was Chief of Naval Staff during World War I and by October 1918 was Minister of Marine and led the delegation that signed the Armistice of Mudros.Huseyin Ra'uf Orbey, W.M. Hale,The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, 174. Rauf Orbay also played a role in assisting Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in a near court-martial during a feud with Djemal Pasha and Enver Pasha. On 31 October 1918, he signed the Armistice of Mudros as the Minister of Navy, which ended the Ottoman Empire's participation in World War I. When the Turkish War of Independence began, he resigned from his position and went to Ankara to collaborate with Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. He was elected as a member of the representative committee in the Congress of Erzurum on 23 July 1919. He joined the Congress of Sivas as a delegate for Sivas on 4 September 1919 and was elected deputy chairman. When the War of Independence ended he became the first Prime Minister of the new provisional Government of the Grand National Assembly on 11 August 1922. In 1924, he was one of the founders of the Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fƒ±rkasƒ± (Progressive Republican Party) at the request of Atat√ºrk as part of Atat√ºrk's attempt to begin the tradition of multiparty democracy in the young Republic, in opposition to Atat√ºrk's Republican People's Party. When this party was closed down in 1925 after Atat√ºrk found that Islamist reactionaries had infiltrated its ranks, Rauf went to exile in Europe for 10 years. Later, he was cleared of all accusations and became a member of the Turkish parliament. During World War II, Rauf Orbay was the Turkish ambassador in London,Selim Deringil, Turkish Foreign Policy during the Second World War: An 'Active' Neutrality, (Cambridge University Press, 1989), 206 n48. helping keep Turkey out of the war. He always firmly believed in the Republic of Turkey and always stated that Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk was the only person who could have organised and lead the transformation of the crumbling Ottoman Empire into modern Turkey.

Due to its particular position at the Set√∫bal Bay, near the mouth of the Sado River and its natural harbour, it‚Äôs an important fishing town. The population in 2011 was 49,500,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 195.47 km¬≤.√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s The present Mayor is Augusto P√≥lvora. General information Besides professional fishing and sport fishing (mainly of swordfish), the most significant revenues in Sesimbra come from tourism. The town is known for its beaches, fish restaurants and nightlife. The original name of Celtic origin was Cempsibriga, meaning the high place (briga) of the Celtic tribe the Cempsi. Close by, on a mountaintop, above sea level, lies strategically (the ruins of) the Moorish castle. It was taken from the Moors, during the Portuguese Reconquista in the year 1165 by king Afonso Henriques with the help of Frank Crusaders. The battlements afford a panorama over Sesimbra, its harbour and the surrounding countryside. In addition to the castle, Sessimbra has two forts dating back to the 17th century; the Fortress of Saint James of Sesimbra in the centre of town and the Fort of S√£o Teod√≥sio da Ponta do Cavalo. The former contains a museum covering Sesimbra's history as a fishing village. During the Age of Discoveries, Sesimbra became an important seaport. Even king Manuel I lived here for a while. In the 17th century the fort Fortaleza de Santiago was built along the beach, as part of Portugal's coastal defence. On 3 June 1602 an English fleet defeated a Spanish galley fleet and in addition captured a large Portuguese carrack and severely damaged the fort. It was even used in the 18th century by Portuguese kings as a seaside retreat. Panoramic view of Sesimbra, Portugal. A tourist travelling to Sesimbra can appreciate its beaches, traditional fish restaurants and the Arr√°bida National Park. Sesimbra is a popular diving location close to Lisbon and the most famous dive site is the wreck of the River Gurara, a Nigerian cargo ship, that sunk in 1989 with the loss of 45 sailors.\\"Diving in Sesimbra\\" Close to the Moorish castle is the church Nossa Senhora do Castelo. It stands on the spot where king Sancho I built a Romanesque chapel in the early 13th century, leading to the creation in 1388 of the parish of Nossa Senhora do Castelo de Sesimbra. The present church was built in 1721. When a new church was built in the village, this church passed into disuse and fell into ruins. It was restored between 1965 and 2001. The walls of the church are inlaid with azulejos. The 17th century-pulpit was made from local pink marble. The gilded triumphal arch of the 18th century-choir is decorated with Manueline motives. On the left side of the choir stands in a niche the gilded and polychromed statue of the Madonna of the Castle on a giant shell. Sesimbra serves as the landing point for the submarine communications cables, such as SAT-3/WASC and Atlantis-2. There is a local radio station in the municipality, Sesimbra FM. Parishes Administratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (freguesias): * Castelo * Quinta do Conde * Santiago International relations =Twin towns - Sister cities= Sesimbra is a founding member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, ≈†kofja Loka in Slovenia, and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

It is affiliated with the M√©tis National Council. Glen McCallum was elected as president in 2017.https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/glen-mccallum-set-to-lead- metis-nation-of-saskatchewan The organization is led by an elected executive council called the Provincial M√©tis Council (PMC). The organization has divided the province into 12 regions, and members within each region vote for their regional representative to the Provincial M√©tis Council. Within the 12 regions exist roughly 130 M√©tis locals, which are smaller organizational structures, each with an elected president. All of the above meet biannually at the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly (MNLA) with representatives from the organization's youth and women departments to discuss matters affecting the M√©tis Nation in the province. The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly serves as the governing authority of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. There is also a president of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, who holds one seat on the Board of Governors of the M√©tis National Council. Past presidents of M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan include Lorna Docken, Cl√©ment Chartier, Jim \\"Jimmy D\\" Durocher, and Robert Doucette. The governance organization was originally named M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan, but this was changed to M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan at the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly on November 18, 2000. History =Early M√©tis governments in Saskatchewan= The earliest M√©tis governments in what is now Saskatchewan began prior to the 1870 Red River Resistance, but grew rapidly after that event. Southbranch Settlement communities such as Duck Lake, St. Laurent, St. Louis, Fish Creek, and Batoche grew along the South Saskatchewan River, growing from the original La Petite Ville mission. Each community had between 40 and 60 families, representing a considerable population. The communities of the Southbranch Settlement gathered on December 10, 1872 outside of the church at St. Laurent to form the Council of St. Laurent with Gabriel Dumont as their president. This council served as the administrative, judicial, and military body for these settlements. This council would adopt a constitution and codify laws that are known as the Laws of St. Laurent, using the Laws of the Buffalo Hunt as their foundation. This council set the precedent for all future M√©tis political activities in Saskatchewan. =M√©tis provisional government= The M√©tis of the Southbranch Settlement, concerned with the arrival of settlers and the need to secure title to their lands, petitioned the Government of Canada for title to the land that they had been living on for years. They grew frustrated with the stalling and general lack of response from the government, so the Council of St. Laurent decided to ask Louis Riel to return from exile in Montana to lead the M√©tis again. Riel would establish the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan led by the Exovedate council established in Batoche on March 19, 1885 that started the North-West Resistance. The Government of Canada responded with a military force, culminating at the Battle of Batoche where the M√©tis government was defeated. =Early political movements= The North-West Resistance resulted in the displacement of many M√©tis, leading to the loss of community. Trying to make the best of new opportunities, the M√©tis looked to farming and other ways to earn a living, but the Dust Bowl and Great Depression of the 1930s left many M√©tis destitute. M√©tis community councils began to form around this time, organizing themselves along the model of labour unions and using the name \\"locals\\" for their representative structure. This led to growing political awareness and social activism among M√©tis, demanding recognition of M√©tis rights. Recognizing the need to establish a formal governance structure for their voice to be heard, M√©tis in Saskatchewan began to organize. The first M√©tis provincial political organization established after the province of Saskatchewan was established was in 1935 under Joe Ross, and was called Half-breeds of Saskatchewan. The organization was created to help with issues that M√©tis people were dealing with as a result of the Great Depression. The organization drafted their first constitution in 1937 and was renamed the Saskatchewan M√©tis Society. In 1943, the Saskatchewan M√©tis Association was formed to represent the M√©tis in the Northern part of Saskatchewan. This organization echoed, and often rivalled the efforts in the South by the Saskatchewan M√©tis Society. Despite strong growth in these organizations in the early years, internal divisions and turmoil as well as the start of the Second World War lead to the dissolution of these early M√©tis political organizations during the years of the War. The M√©tis political movement would be restarted in the 1960s. In 1964, the M√©tis Association of Saskatchewan was established to focus on issues for Northern M√©tis people, and in 1965, the M√©tis Society of Saskatchewan was established to focus on issues for Southern M√©tis people. Recognizing the benefits of working together, the M√©tis Association of Saskatchewan and the M√©tis Society of Saskatchewan amalgamated in 1967 under the banner of M√©tis Society of Saskatchewan. The organization was renamed to the Association of M√©tis and Non-Status Indians of Saskatchewan (AMNIS) in 1975 under the leadership of Jim Sinclair, the M√©tis Society of Saskatchewan in 1988, the M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan in 1993, and finally the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan in 2000. Past leaders of these organizations include Joe Larocque, Jim Brady, Malcolm Norris, Howard Adams, Jim Sinclair, Jimmy Durocher, Cl√©ment Chartier, Gerald Morin, and Robert Doucette. M√©tis government =Contemporary political structures= The M√©tis of Saskatchewan met to establish the M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan (later renamed to M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan in 2000), adopt a constitution in 1993, and declare the M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan to be a self-governing body for the M√©tis of Saskatchewan. The first sitting of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly was in 1994. =Self-Government= Recognizing their distinct identity as M√©tis, the pursuit of M√©tis rights and self-determination, and seeking to be a third order of government, the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan was established as the governance organization of the M√©tis of Saskatchewan. The M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan has been operating through legislation for non-profit organizations. Though the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan has pushed the limits of what is possible within the legislation to move forward in shaping their governance and moving forward their political aspirations, the legislation has limited what the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan is able to accomplish in terms of being self-governing and independent from the authority of the Government of Saskatchewan and Government of Canada. The M√©tis of Canada have been fighting for recognition of their Indigenous rights and their inherent right to practice them. Until , neither the Government of Saskatchewan nor Government of Canada wanted to hold responsibility of negotiating with the M√©tis. After the Daniels v Canada decision, the Government of Canada and the M√©tis Nation (represented by the M√©tis National Council and give members of its board of governors) signed the Canada‚ÄìM√©tis Nation Accord on April 13, 2017 to start to repair the relationship between The Crown and the M√©tis Nation, to address the legacy of the wrongs committed against M√©tis people and the M√©tis Nation, to move forward on recognition of M√©tis rights, and to address the needs and issues facing M√©tis people. On July 20, 2018, M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan and Canada signed the Framework Agreement for Advancing Reconciliation, which established the mechanism by which the negotiations on the shared objectives would be conducted. As negotiations have progressed between Canada and the M√©tis Nation, M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, along with M√©tis Nation of Ontario and M√©tis Nation of Alberta, signed the M√©tis Government Recognition and Self- Government Agreement with Canada on June 27, 2019. These agreements are an important step towards self-government for the citizens of M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. =The M√©tis Act= In 2002, the Government of Saskatchewan passed The M√©tis Act. The Constitution of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan establishes the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan as a self- governing entity, and distinguishes the difference between the political existence as a M√©tis government from the existence as a non-profit corporation that provides programs and services. The M√©tis Act is the first legislation in Canada to recognize the political aspirations of the M√©tis. It established a bilateral process that empowers the elected leadership of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan to negotiate as an equal partner with the Government of Saskatchewan on matters of interest to the M√©tis. This is an unprecedented de facto recognition in Canada of M√©tis aspirations of M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan as a governance institution, though it stops short of recognizing the Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan as a government. M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan governance structure Traditional M√©tis governance practices of participatory governance and community councils are the basis for the governance structures and practices of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. =Locals= Locals are the basic unit of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, and they operate at the community level. Each local has an elected leadership that may include executive, board of directors, and other structures that a local establishes for their own governance that are consistent with the Constitution of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. Locals may also incorporate with the appropriate government. Locals have the responsibility of preparing communities for self- government, and they may seek the necessary finances and resources for their programs, services, and other objectives that they have established. To be an active local, a local must have a minimum of nine members, and they must hold local leadership elections every one to three years. A M√©tis citizen can belong to only one local at a time, and they must ordinarily reside in the area of the local for a minimum of six months before they are allowed to join a local (exceptions can be made for educational or medical purposes, or where there a local does not exist in a community). Locals were originally modelled on the labour movement, and were established as collective representative bodies for their members to assert their rights. =Urban Councils= The Constitution of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan allows for the establishment of urban councils. In the major cities of Saskatchewan, there are often more than one local, dividing either on geography or on mandate. The urban locals in a given city are allowed to establish an urban council if they choose to help move towards self-government. =Regions= The M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan has divided the province of Saskatchewan into 12 regions: * Northern Region I; * Northern Region II; * Northern Region III; * Eastern Region I; * Eastern Region II; * Eastern Region IIa; * Eastern Region III; * Western Region I; * Western Region Ia; * Western Region II; * Western Region IIa; and * Western Region III. Each region is governed by a regional council that consists of the local presidents in that region and the area director who serves as the chairperson of the regional council and sits as the regionally elected representative on the Provincial M√©tis Council. The regional councils have the authority to make appointments to the institutions and affiliates at the regional and provincial level. The regional council is responsible for supporting the locals to assume self-government, including helping to provide the necessary finances and resources for programs and services in accordance with the objectives and duties of the locals and the regional council. The regional council is responsible for providing direction to their area director with respect to the aims, objectives, and aspirations for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan with respect to their respective region. =Executive= There are four executive members of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan: * President; * Vice President; * Secretary; and * Treasurer. These executive positions are elected province wide, and the terms are four years. The president serves as the chief political spokesperson for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, and is responsible for assigning portfolios, subject to the approval of the Provincial M√©tis Council and ratification by the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly . =Provincial M√©tis Council= The Provincial M√©tis Council (PMC) is responsible for ensuring the operations of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan are running smoothly. The members of the Provincial M√©tis Council also serve as the directors for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan Secretariat Inc. The Provincial M√©tis Council ordinarily consists of 18 members: * four executive members; * 12 elected regional representatives (one from each of the 12 regions); * one representative of the M√©tis Women of Saskatchewan (Les Filles de Madeleine); and * one representative of the Provincial M√©tis Youth Council. Terms for the Executive are four years. The Provincial M√©tis Council forms the cabinet of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan government, and hold portfolios assigned to them by the President of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, subject to approval by the Provincial M√©tis Council and the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly . Each member of the Provincial M√©tis Council is responsible for ensuring that the affiliates, departments, programs, and services within their portfolio have the necessary finances and resources to operate effectively. They also sit at the chairperson of the affiliate(s) which are part of their portfolio. Terms for the regional representatives are four years. =M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly= The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly (MNLA) is the governing authority of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly is comprised of the Provincial M√©tis Council (including the members of the Executive), four representatives of the M√©tis Women of Saskatchewan (Les Filles de Madeleine), four representatives of the Provincial M√©tis Youth Council, and all presidents of locals across the province (or the vice president of the local as the alternate if the president is unable to attend). Quorum for sittings of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly is 75 members. The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly is to sit at least twice a year, though this has rarely been observed (often due to the lack of sufficient resources to hold the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly ). The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly has the power to enact legislation, regulations, rules, and resolutions that are necessary to govern the affairs of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan (including approving the budget of M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan) and the conduct of citizens of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. To over see the sitting of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly selects a speaker and deputy speaker. They are responsible for overseeing the setting of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, including the procedures, rules, and debates, and maintaining the decorum of the sitting. They also have the authority to have the Dumont's Scouts expel members or attendees from the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly if they do not follow the ruling of the speaker or otherwise disrupt the decorum on the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly . The speaker and deputy speaker serve as the chairperson and co-chairperson for the Annual General Assembly. The speaker and deputy speaker serve for a two-year term, subject to reappointment. To assist in keeping the decorum of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, Dumont's Scouts are appointed by the Provincial M√©tis Council, and ratified by the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly . The Dumont's Scouts are generally M√©tis veterans. Sitting members of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly are eligible to be appointed to hold portfolios. Originally, this was limited to only members of the Provincial M√©tis Council, but this was expanded to members of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly to provide more options for appointing people to hold portfolios. =Les Filles de Madeleine= Les Filles de Madeleine is the provincial organization in Saskatchewan that is mandated to provide a voice for M√©tis Nation women. The board of directors for Les Filles de Madeleine has one director elected from each of the 12 regions of the province. The goals of Les Filles de Madeleine * Promote the development of programs and services which seek to address issues and right of M√©tis women and which improves conditions which are unique to their circumstances; and * Ensure at all times, a strong collaborative relationship between the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, the political bodies within the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan; their directors and citizens as well as Les Filles de Madeleine Secretariat Inc., chapters and members which in turn supports the needs and interests of the grassroots women in Saskatchewan both regionally and at the national level. The objectives of Les Filles de Madeleine Secretariat Inc. are: # To consult with its local chapters to identify issues, concerns and needs of M√©tis women and their family(ies); # To develop a continuum of support services and to seek funding resources for their delivery; # To deliver culturally sensitive programs and services which are tailored to meet the needs of M√©tis women and families; # To negotiate and partner with existing government and non-government organizations to access available programs and services which address the needs of M√©tis women and families; # To share information with the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan concerning the needs and conditions of members which need to be addressed by the M√©tis Nation; # To support and cooperate with the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, Provincial Government and the Federal Government in obtaining resources, developing programs and delivering services directed at the needs of M√©tis women; # To support the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan in addressing and advancing rights of M√©tis people as an Indigenous people, including the right to self- government; and # To support the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan in its effort to have such rights entrenched in the Constitution of Canada and/or in the Saskatchewan legislation. =Provincial M√©tis Youth Council= The Provincial M√©tis Youth Council provides an opportunity to ensure that the voice of youth is always heard as a part of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan government. Intricately incorporating youth within the governance structures of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan helps to ensure that issues that youth are dealing with are not overlooked; it provides opportunities for mentor and support the future leaders of the M√©tis Nation; and it brings together the different segments of the M√©tis population to work as a united front. =Senate= The Senate of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan have a mostly ceremonial role. They provide opening and closing prayers at the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, and they provide advice, guidance, and recommendations to the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly . The Senate operates as a collective unit that represents, serves, and protects the best interests of the M√©tis people and the Constitution of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. They operate through consensus, and senators are to devote time, thoughts, and study to their work. It was established to honour the central role of elder in traditional M√©tis communities. When the Senate had been originally established, they had much more authority over the activities of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. They served as the judicial arm for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan with the power to resolve disputes that occurred between regions and locals, they formed the M√©tis Elections Commission to oversee elections and by-elections of Executive and Provincial M√©tis Council, and they oversaw the operations of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan from the period when the general election was called and to when candidates were elected. The authority of the Senate was removed in 2008. =General Assembly= The General Assembly is the political forum for M√©tis citizens in Saskatchewan. The General Assembly meets annually, and provides a forum where M√©tis citizens receive information from their government, review documents and provide guidance to the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, and where they discuss, amend, and vote on ratification of amendments to the Constitution of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. =M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan Secretariat Inc.= The M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan Secretariat Inc. serves as the administrative body for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, through which the policies and programs directed by the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan are administered and carried out. This is because the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan is recognized as the government democratically elected by the M√©tis citizens of Saskatchewan to advance their Aboriginal rights, including self-government and self-determination, but the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan has to operate through non-profit structures until formally recognized and legislated as a third order of government. The Government of Saskatchewan enacted The M√©tis Act (Chapter M-14.01 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 2001) to promote and strengthen M√©tis governance of their institutions and communities through partnership between the Government of Canada, Government of Saskatchewan, and M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, and established M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan Secretariat Inc. pursuant to The M√©tis Act. =M√©tis National Council= The M√©tis National Council (MNC) is a national organization that advocates on behalf of the five governing members of the M√©tis Nation in Canada. The M√©tis National Council is a partnership between M√©tis Nation of Ontario, Manitoba M√©tis Federation, M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, M√©tis Nation of Alberta, and M√©tis Nation British Columbia. The presidents of each of the five governing members form the Board of Governors, and the M√©tis National Council General Assembly consists of 15 elected provincial voting delegates from the three founding members (Manitoba M√©tis Federation, M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, and M√©tis Nation of Alberta) and five elected provincial voting delegates from the non-founding members (M√©tis Nation of Ontario and M√©tis Nation British Columbia). The delegates for the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan are the Provincial M√©tis Council and any remaining seats can be filled from members chosen from the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly. =Affiliates= M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan has established several affiliates that support the needs of M√©tis citizens in Saskatchewan. These affiliates include: * Back to Batoche; * Clarence Campeau Development Fund; * Gabriel Dumont Institute; * M√©tis Addictions Council of Saskatchewan (MACSI); * Provincial M√©tis Housing Corporation (PMHC); and * SaskM√©tis Economic Development Corporation (SMEDCO). The M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly, on behalf of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan, exercises all voting rights, power, and duties of ownership of the affiliates, in accordance with the recommendations provided by the Provincial M√©tis Council. The member of the M√©tis Nation Legislative Assembly with the portfolio responsible for the affiliate sits as the chairperson of that affiliate. However, under non-profit legislation, the affiliates are independent to the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan. Citizenship in the M√©tis Nation In 2000, the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan formally adopted the National Definition of M√©tis: # DEFINITION (amended January 2004) 1. M√©tis means a person, who self identifies as M√©tis, is distinct from other Aboriginal peoples, is of historic M√©tis Nation Ancestry and is accepted by the M√©tis Nation. 2. \\"Historic M√©tis Nation\\" means the Aboriginal people then known as M√©tis or Half-breeds who resided in the Historic M√©tis Nation Homeland. 3. \\"Historic M√©tis Nation Homeland\\" means the area of west central North America used and occupied as the traditional territory of the M√©tis or Half-breeds as they were known. 4. \\"M√©tis Nation\\"means the Aboriginal people descended from the Historic M√©tis Nation which is now comprised of all M√©tis Nation citizens and is one of the \\"aboriginal\\" peoples of Canada within the meaning of s.35 of the Constitution Act 1982. 5. \\"Distinct from other Aboriginal peoples\\" means distinct for culture and nationhood purposes. To ensure that the citizenship review process was in accordance with this definition, the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan ratified the M√©tis Nation of Saskatchewan Citizenship Act, which outlines the establishment of the M√©tis Nation‚ÄîSaskatchewan Registry, appointment of the Registrar, the process of citizenship registration, and other matters relevant to operation of the Registry.

He was an architectural historian, novelist and biographer. His extensive diaries remain in print. Early life Lees-Milne was born on 6 August 1908 at Wickhamford Manor, Worcestershire. His biographer Michael Bloch observed that in Another Self, Lees-Milne \\"conveys the impression that he hailed from an old county family and that Wickhamford was their native seat. This was not quite the case. ... His father ... had bought Wickhamford, and moved from Lancashire to Worcestershire, only two years before Jim's birth.\\"James Lees-Milne ‚Äì The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, p. 1. He was the second of three children and elder son of prosperous cotton manufacturer and farmer George Crompton Lees-Milne (1880‚Äì1949) and his wife Helen Christina (1884‚Äì1962), a daughter of Henry Bailey, J.P., D.L., of Coates, Gloucestershire. Lees-Milne's maternal grandfather was Sir Joseph Bailey, 1st Baronet, and his uncle, Joseph Bailey, the second baronet, was later created Baron Glanusk. George Lees-Milne, formerly a lieutenant in the Cheshire Yeomanry, was chairman of the family business A. and A. Crompton & Co. Ltd, deriving his fortune mainly from a Lancashire cotton millJames Lees- Milne, The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, p. 1.Capitalism, Culture and Decline in Britain: 1750‚Äì1990, W. D. Rubinstein, Routledge, 1993, p. 127. Lees-Milne's parents were a \\"curiously contrasting couple\\"; his father, \\"shy but steady\\", was \\"conventional in outlook\\" with a \\"predilection for gambling and philandering\\", \\"obsessively punctual and constantly making plans\\", in contrast to his wife, \\"uninhibited with a streak of mental instability ... which ran in the Bailey family and which [Lees-Milne] always feared might lurk in himself\\" ‚Äì she was \\"unconventional\\", \\"whimsical and impulsive\\"; where \\"she had a sense of humour, he had none\\". An exaggerated portrait of his parents, presenting them as \\"a pair of ludicrous eccentrics\\", appears in Another Life.James Lees-Milne ‚Äì The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, p. 8. Lees-Milne's sister Audrey, who was born in 1905, later married Matthew Arthur, 3rd Baron Glenarthur. His younger brother Richard was born 1910.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol. 1, ed. Peter Townend, 1965, \\"Lees-Milne formerly of Wickhamford Manor\\" pedigree. The Lees-Milne family were a branch of the Lees family that later came to own Thurland Castle, Lancashire, having owned an estate called Clarksfield near Oldham since the reign of James I. They were \\"a rough lot\\" (Lees-Milne suggested their motto ought to have been \\"Sport and Booze\\"), and although the discovery of coal on their land increased their wealth, this \\"did not civilise them\\" ‚Äì Lees-Milne's great-grandfather, Joseph Lees, was \\"one of three barely-literate brothers ... known, after their respective obsessions, as Nimrod, Ramrod and Fishing Rod\\". They were connected by marriage to two \\"slightly grander\\" families ‚Äì the Cromptons of Crompton Hall, and the Milnes of Park House.James Lees-Milne ‚Äì The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, pp. 1‚Äì2.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol. 3, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 1972, \\"Lees formerly of Thurland Castle\\" pedigree. The name Milne was added by royal licence in 1890 by Lees-Milne's grandfather James (the first of the family to attend Eton) in order to inherit the estate of a maternal relative. A pillar of the Conservative party in Oldham, supporting Winston Churchill's candidacy, this James Lees-Milne was said to have refused a baronetcy (which would have come to his grandson, James) on the grounds that it might oblige him to make public speeches.James Lees-Milne ‚Äì The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, p. 2. The estate thus acquired included Crompton Hall, Lancashire, which alongside Wickhamford Manor was owned by George Crompton Lees-Milne.

Career From 1931 to 1935, he was private secretary to the 1st Baron Lloyd.James Lees-Milne, Ancestral Voices (London: Chatto & Windus, 1975), p. 6 n1. In 1936 Lees-Milne was appointed secretary of the Country Houses Committee of the National Trust. He held the position until 1950, apart from a period of military service from 1939 to 1941. During his tenure he was a regular contributor to the Trust's members' newsletter. He was instrumental in the first large-scale transfer of country houses from private ownership to the Trust. He resigned his full-time position in 1950, but continued his connection with the National Trust as a part-time architectural consultant and member of committees. =Writings= From 1947 Lees-Milne published several architectural works aimed primarily at the general reader. He was also a diarist ‚Äì his witty, waspish and extensive diaries appeared in twelve volumes and were well received. Larry McMurtry commented that Lees-Milne, like Pepys and Boswell, was disarmingly open about his failings ‚Äì indeed, would not have known how to go about concealing them.Larry McMurtry, Out of the Mists The New York Review of Books Nicholas Birns notes that Lees-Milne spoke \\"so candidly about himself, his life, and his love of art and architecture that his authorial relationship with the reader becomes a privileged one, not to be readily or casually communicated, not to be flaunted or brandished.\\"The Worcestershire grumbler: the writings of James Lees-Milne, diarist and man of letters Lees-Milne also wrote other works, including several biographies ‚Äì for instance of Harold Nicolson, The Bachelor Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Esher ‚Äî and an autobiographical novel. In 1993 Lees-Milne declined a CBE in the New Year's Honours list, considering it inadequate recognition compared with the knighthood he felt was his due. Personal life Lees-Milne was visiting Diana, Lady Mosley (Diana Mitford), in December 1936 when King Edward VIII abdicated. The purpose of his visit there was to examine the 17th-century house that she and her husband Sir Oswald Mosley were then renting. He recorded later how he and Diana (her husband was in London) had listened to the King's broadcast abdication speech with tears running down their faces. He was the lover of her brother Tom Mitford when they were at Eton College together, and was devastated when Tom was killed in action in Burma in 1945. Lees-Milne was friends with many of the prominent British intellectual and social figures of his day, including Nancy Mitford, Harold Nicolson, Diana Mitford (a former lover about whom he wrote a two-volume biography), Clementine Hudson (the Banbury aristocrat), Levi Schmeevi and Cyril Connolly. In 1951, he married Alvilde, Viscountess Chaplin, n√©e Bridges, a prominent gardening and landscape expert. Both Lees-Milne and Alvilde were bisexual, and Alvilde is reputed to have had lesbian affairs with Vita Sackville-West, Winnaretta Singer and others.Review of Diaries, 1971‚Äì1983 by James Lees-Milne, Sunday Express Retrieved 18 November 2007. Alvilde Lees-Milne died in 1994. Lees-Milne died in hospital at Tetbury on 28 December 1997. His ashes and those of his wife, Alvilde, were scattered in the grounds of Essex House. =Residences= After 13 years at Alderley Grange, Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire,Michael Bloch: \\"James Lees-Milne ‚Äì The Life\\". and a brief period in Bath, he and Alvilde lived after 1974 at Essex House on the Badminton estate, also in Gloucestershire, while he worked most days in William Thomas Beckford's library at Lansdown Crescent. While living in Badminton he entered into a feud with his landlord, the 10th Duke of Beaufort, whose foxhunting passion and autocratic manner appalled him. After Alvilde Lees-Milne's death, however, the Beauforts offered to allow him to live at Essex House rent free. Although touched, Lees-Milne valued his independence and possessed the income to pay rent and did not accept this offer, nor that of his friends, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, to live as a permanent guest at Chatsworth.James Lees-Milne‚Äì The Life, Michael Bloch, John Murray, 2009, p. 343. As a Trustee of the Bath Preservation Trust, he became a Founding Trustee of its Beckford's Tower Trust, established in 1977 to preserve and maintain the building and its collection for public benefit. In popular culture A series of three plays inspired by Lees-Milne's diaries ‚Äì Sometimes into the Arms of God, The Unending Battle and What England Owes ‚Äì were broadcast by the BBC in July 2013.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2003 through 2015 for the Colorado Rockies, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates, and San Diego Padres. Collegiate career Barmes attended Olney Central College and Indiana State University. While at Indiana State, Barmes was voted All-Region by the ABCA and All-Conference. Barmes teamed with Mitch Stetter to lead the Sycamores to the semi-finals of the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament. Barmes played one season at Indiana State in 2000 after transferring from Olney Central College. Barmes led the Sycamores in hitting during his lone season at ISU, posting a .375 batting average with 93 hits, 18 doubles, seven triples and 10 home runs with 63 runs scored, 37 runs batted in and 20 stolen bases. Indiana State went 31-28-1 on the diamond in 2000, reaching the semifinals of the MVC Tournament. Professional career =Colorado Rockies= Minors Drafted by the Rockies in 2000 out of Indiana State University, Barmes played three seasons of minor league baseball before reaching the majors with Colorado. He spent time in subsequent seasons (2004‚Äì2005, 2007‚Äì2008) for rehabilitation and demotions. In 2002, he was a post-season All-Star for the Carolina Mudcats of the Southern League; in 2004, he was a post-season All-Star for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League and 2007, he was a mid-season All- Star for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League. 2003‚Äì05 seasons From 2003 to 2004, Barmes posted a .292 batting average with two home runs and 12 RBIs in 32 games played. In 2005 in 81 games Clint hit .289, 10 home runs, and 46 RBIs. Colorado Rockies in 2008 2005 season On Opening Day at Coors Field, Barmes hit a game-winning, walk-off home run off Trevor Hoffman of the San Diego Padres, becoming the first Rockies rookie to hit such a home run. At the end of the month, MLB selected Barmes as the National League Rookie of the Month for April. Barmes, who hit .410 with four home runs and 14 RBIs, also became the third player in MLB history to hit .400 or better in March/April, joining the New York Mets' Willie Randolph in 1980 and Montreal Expos' Andr√©s Galarraga in 1986. In June, Barmes suffered an injury that sidelined him until September after breaking his left collarbone in a fall while carrying a package of deer meat given to him as a gift by Todd Helton up the stairs in his apartment building on June 5. (Barmes initially told the team and the press that he got hurt carrying groceries, but later admitted that this was not the truth. He claimed that he was trying to prevent Helton from being embarrassed.) Barmes, who was leading National League rookies in most offensive categories, underwent surgery on June 7. He was hitting around .400 and led the major leagues in batting average for the first six weeks of the season. After a mild slump, he was still leading NL rookies in hitting (.329), runs (40), hits (74), doubles (16), home runs (8) and RBIs (34) up until the time of his injury. His Rookie of the Year candidacy, however, was ruined by his freak injury, which he called \\"the craziest thing that's happened to me, by far.\\" However, Barmes still finished eighth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting for the season. 2006 season Barmes entered the 2006 season with high expectations. Many predicted a repeat of the beginning of the '05 season for Barmes in '06. Although Barmes set career highs in a number of offensive categories, his '06 season was widely considered a disappointment. He managed a subpar .220 batting average (the lowest of any starter in baseball) with only 7 home runs and a .264 on-base percentage. 2007 season As Spring Training prior to the 2007 season began, Barmes was informed that recently drafted prospect Troy Tulowitzki would be competing with him for the starting role in '07. After a spring performance that mirrored his unimpressive '06 season, Barmes ultimately lost the Rockies starting shortstop role to Tulowitzki. Subsequently, Barmes began the regular season with the Rockies Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. After an injury to starting second baseman Kazuo Matsui, Barmes was recalled to the Major League roster on April 15. After wearing jersey number 12 throughout his tenure in the Majors, Barmes switched to number 21 for the '07 season after veteran Steve Finley chose number 12 for the season. Not long after being recalled, Barmes was sent down to Triple-A on May 1. 2008 season With Tulowitzki firmly entrenched in the shortstop position, Barmes entered Spring Training as one of four players aiming to start at second base for the Rockies. The job was ultimately won by Jayson Nix, who subsequently started the regular season very poorly. With the benching of Nix, Barmes competed with teammates Jeff Baker and Omar Quintanilla for the starting second baseman role. Barmes would win the job. He produced very well as the second baseman, although sustained an injury that put him on the Disabled List for several weeks. Upon his return Barmes continued as the Rockies starting second baseman for the remainder of the season. Barmes walked into Spring Training prior to the 2009 season as the starting second baseman. 2009 season In 2009, Barmes started off the season with the starting job and hit nearly .300. He went into a hitting slump and dropped down to .225, and then jumped on a hot streak and went up to .296 on June 19. He hit 23 home runs on the year. 2010 season Started regularly at 2B for the Rockies but was switched to Shortstop following Troy Tulowitzki's wrist injury. When Tulowitzki returned from his injury Barmes moved back to 2B. Barmes struggled in the second half of the season and was benched in favor of Eric Young, Jr.. He spent most of the 2nd half as a defensive replacement. Barmes finished the season hitting .235, 8 HR, and 50 RBI. Houston Astros in 2011 =Houston Astros= On November 18, 2010, Barmes was traded to the Houston Astros for Felipe Paulino. He got his first hit for the Astros (a two-run double) on May 3, 2011. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Barmes signed a two-year, $10.5 million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on November 21, 2011. On August 12, 2012, Barmes hit his first career grand slam to assist the Pirates in overturning a 5‚Äì2 deficit to an 11‚Äì5 victory against the Padres. Overall the 2012 season was not a success for Barmes, he batted .229 on 445 at bats with 8 home runs, 45 RBIs, 16 doubles, and one triple. The 2013 season started off on the same route as '12 which eventually led to him being benched in favor of rookie Jordy Mercer. Over the course of the 2013 season, Barmes platooned with Mercer at shortstop. On December 12, 2013, Barmes signed a new one-year, $2 million contract to rejoin the Pirates for 2014 as Mercer's backup. =San Diego Padres= On December 5, 2014, Barmes signed a 1-year deal with the San Diego Padres.Padres officially sign Clint Barmes On July 7, 2015, Barmes returned to Pittsburgh to face the Pirates. PNC Park played his walkup music Don't Stop Believin' by Journey to pay homage to his stint with the Bucs, and he was given a standing ovation by the fans. Barmes with the Omaha Storm Chasers, triple-A affiliates of the Royals, in =Kansas City Royals= On February 18, 2016, Barmes signed a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals as a non- roster invitee to spring training. He was released on March 28, and re-signed to another minor league contract on April 1. =Retirement= On May 23, 2016, Barmes announced his immediate retirement from baseball.

As someone becomes wealthier, their demand for cheap fast food is likely to decrease, and their demand for more expensive steak may increase. Consumption may be tied to relative wealth. Particularly when supply is highly inelastic, or when the seller is a monopoly, one's ability to purchase a good may be highly related to one's relative wealth in the economy. Consider for example the cost of real estate in a city with high average wealth (for example New York or London), in comparison to a city with a low average wealth. Supply is fairly inelastic, so if a helicopter drop (or gold rush) were to suddenly create large amounts of wealth in the low wealth city, those who did not receive this new wealth would rapidly find themselves crowded out of such markets, and materially worse off in terms of their ability to consume/purchase real estate (despite having participated in a weak Pareto improvement). In such situations, one cannot dismiss the relative effect of wealth on demand and supply, and cannot assume that these are static (see also General equilibrium). However, according to David Backus the wealth effect is not observable in economic data, at least in regard to increases or decreases in home or stock equity. For example, while the stock market boom in the late 1990s (caused by the dot-com bubble) increased the wealth of Americans, it did not produce a significant change in consumption, and after the crash, consumption did not decrease. Economist Dean Baker disagrees and says that ‚Äúhousing wealth effect‚Äù is well-known and is a standard part of economic theory and modeling, and that economists expect households to consume based on their wealth. He cites approvingly research done by Carroll and Zhou that estimates that households increase their annual consumption by 6 cents for every additional dollar of home equity. In macroeconomics In macroeconomics, a rise in real wealth increases consumption, shifting the IS curve out to the right, thus pushing up interest rates and increasing aggregate demand. A decrease in real wealth does the opposite.

Medieval Ordensburgen  The Ordensburgs were originally constructed by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and later the Teutonic Knights to fortify territory in Prussia and Livonia captured from the native populations - Old Prussians, Lithuanians and native peoples of what is now Latvia and Estonia. Later, Ordensburgs were used to attack Lithuania. Since they were built and used by religious military orders, the Ordensburgs often resembled cloisters. While they were considerably larger than those in the Holy Roman Empire, they were much scarcer in the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. While a normal castle in the Reich would control about 38 km2, a castle would control 370 km2 in Prussia and 789 km2 in Livonia, Courland and Estonia. The few small castles are considered to be of vassals, while the larger ones might have served as arsenals and strongholds during the Northern Crusades and were purpose-built to colonize the respective countries and peoples by capturing (and holding) territory. Most Ordensburgs were rectangular, even quadratic in form, built from red brick and lacking a Bergfried. Many castles had no towers at all, as the bailey, a mighty quadrangle, was considered sufficient for defence. = List of medieval Ordensburgen =Adsel (Gaujiena, Latvia) - a genuine order castle, seat of a commandery *Allenstein (Olsztyn, Poland) *Alschwangen (Alsunga, Latvia) -

He is best known for his time in WWE as Mike Mondo and Mikey as a member of The Spirit Squad. He also appeared in Major League Wrestling (MLW) in a tag team with fellow Squad member Kenny Dykstra during 2019. He also worked in Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). After training at the Critical Mass Wrestling School, he debuted in June 2002 and began working for several independent promotions as Mike Mondo, Livewyre, or El Livewyre. His earliest success came in the New York Wrestling Connection promotion, where he won the NYWC Heavyweight Championship on two occasions between 2003 and 2005. In February 2005, he signed a contract with WWE, and was assigned to the OVW developmental territory. There, he formed The Spirit Squad faction with four other wrestlers. The Spirit Squad debuted on the Raw brand in January 2006, and quickly won the World Tag Team Championship in April. They held the championship for seven months, before losing it in early November. They were taken off television in late 2006. He returned to OVW in 2007, before being moved to the Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) territory in September. He competed in FCW until his WWE release in June 2008. He then returned to the independent circuit, and later returned to OVW, where he won both the OVW Television Championship and the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship in 2009. He went on to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship for the first time in mid-2010 and the second time in early 2011.  Professional wrestling career  =Early career (2002‚Äì2005) = Brendli began training at the Critical Mass Pro Wrestling wrestling school during his freshman year of college. He debuted in June 2002, and wrestled on the independent circuit, both in New York and in New Jersey. Brendli first became known as \\"Livewyre\\", occasionally competing under a mask as \\"El Livewyre\\". Most of his early success was in the New York Wrestling Connection promotion, where he had a nine-month undefeated streak. Competing as \\"Livewire\\" Mike Mondo he won the NYWC Heavyweight Championship from \\"Superstar\\" Dickie Rodz on June 7, 2003, holding it for approximately two months, until he vacated it. On March 26, 2005, he defeated Joey Matthews to win the NYWC Heavyweight Championship for the second time, and later successfully retained the championship against Mikey Whipwreck. Mondo lost the championship to Matt Striker on April 30, after holding it for just over a month. Brendli was also competing in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) during this time, making his debut in September 2003. He appeared in several dark matches prior to the television tapings against wrestlers including Tank Toland, Joey Matthews, and Carly Col√≥n. = World Wrestling Entertainment =  Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005‚Äì2006)  Brendli signed a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) developmental contract in February 2005, and was assigned to OVW full-time. First he acted as a manager, then became a full-time wrestler and a member of the Bolin Services faction led by Kenny \\"The King\\" Bolin. He competed in a tournament for the OVW Television Championship, but lost in the first round to Alexis Laree. Embarrassed by losing to a female wrestler, Mondo issued an open challenge to any woman backstage, and a result, lost to Victoria. In late summer 2005, Mondo feuded with Brent Albright after attacking Albright during a match with Da Beast and injuring his eye. Albright obtained revenge on Mondo, however, defeating him by submission at the television tapings on September 7. Throughout the end of 2005, Mondo continued to team with various members of Bolin Services, mainly Johnny Jeter and Da Beast. In December 2005, Mondo debuted a character, where he pretended to be a luchadore, and competed under a mask as \\"El Mondo\\". He won several dark matches using the El Mondo gimmick, before losing to CM Punk in a televised match.  The Spirit Squad (2005‚Äì2006)  In late 2005, Mondo joined the Spirit Squad, a faction of five wrestlers using the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, as Mikey. Brendli has described being in the Spirit Squad as \\"the most fun\\" he's had in his career. Mikey and Kenny began appearing in dark matches and at live events using the Spirit Squad gimmick, and on January 2, 2006, Mikey lost to Chavo Guerrero. On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler by distracting Lawler and performing cheers for Coachman. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The heel (villainous) McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches. They also wrestled in the tag team division, and on April 3, on Raw, Mikey and Kenny defeated Kane and The Big Show to win the World Tag Team Championship, with help from the other Spirit Squad members. After winning the championship, all five members of the Spirit Squad were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship. In May, McMahon signed another handicap match, with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The Spirit Squad instead attacked Michaels before the match had started, and Triple H came out to help them. As a result of feeling disrespected by the Squad, however, Triple H helped Michaels instead. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on the Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII. At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the Squad also wrestled other teams in Raw's tag division over their World Tag Team Championship, successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay-per-view in September. The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with Johnny, Mikey, and Mitch losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw. After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme tag team, Kenny attacked Mikey on the October 23 episode of Raw and announced that he was going to defeat Flair. With the help of the other Spirit Squad members, Kenny was successful, despite Flair being accompanied to the ring by his own reinforcements (Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and Roddy Piper). It was then announced that Flair and a legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship. The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of Raw, when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that episode, DX placed all members into a crate stamped \\"OVW, Louisville, Kentucky\\", a reference to the developmental territory from which all the Squad members had come.  Return to developmental territories (2007‚Äì2008)  Brendli, under the name Mikey Mondo, appeared at the January 17 OVW taping along with Nick Nemeth and teamed with Mike Kruel in a match against Seth Skyfire, Shawn Spears, and Cody Runnels. The pair teamed up for a while as The Frat Boys, and later The Frat Pack, but they had disbanded by late March 2007. Mondo moved into singles competition, and picked up wins over Steve Lewington, Boris Alexiev, and Colt Cabana, among others. In June 2007, he started a feud with Shawn Spears over the OVW Television Championship, but failed to capture it on several occasions. A one-night reunion with Nemeth followed, before he began dubbing himself \\"The Professional\\" Mike Mondo and began feuding with Atlas DaBone. In September 2007, Mondo was moved to the Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) developmental territory and defeated Chris Gray in his debut there. He once again reformed his tag team with Nemeth, and they wrestled against teams including Hade Vansen and Chris Gray, and the New Generation Hart Foundation of Teddy Hart and TJ Wilson. At the start of 2008, however, they split and began feuding, competing against each other both in singles and tag team matches. Having dubbed himself \\"Mighty Mikey\\", he went to wrestle Ted DiBiase, Jr., Sinn Bowdee, Heath Miller, and Jack Gabriel throughout the early part of 2008. On June 13, 2008, WWE announced that Brendli had been released from his contract. =Independent circuit (2008‚Äìpresent)= After his WWE release, Brendli returned to competing on the independent circuit, and, in an interview in December 2008, said he plans to wrestle in Mexico and Japan. He competed for several independent promotions, including Division I Pro Wrestling and Ward Family Entertainments, where he reprised his feud with Rory McAllister of the former WWE tag team, The Highlanders. Brendli made it to the semi final of the 17th annual ECWA Super 8 Tournament before losing to eventual winner Damian Dragon. Brendli participated in Chikara's 2014 King of Trios tournament under his Spirit Squad character, and teamed with Johnny and Kenny. After a win over Sinn Bodhi and the Odditorium (Qefka the Quiet and Sir Oliver Grimsly) on September 19, the Spirit Squad was eliminated from the tournament in the second round on September 20 by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus, and Mark Angelosetti). He also returned to the New York Wrestling Connection on September 20, 2008, at Draw The Line, where he teamed with Mikey Whipwreck in a losing effort to Rob Eckos and Frederick of Hollywood. On February 28, 2015 Mondo defeated Rex Lawless to win the NYWC Fusion title. He later vacated the championship in April due a schedule conflict, meaning he could not defend the championship. In 2016, he was inducted into the NYWC Hall of Fame. On November 12, 2016, wrestling as The Spirit Squad, Mondo and Doane captured the NYWC Tag Team Championship from Hounds of Hatred (Boo and Bam Sullivan) at Firestorm 3. 15 days later, Spirit Squad lost the titles back to Hounds of Hatred. The pair continued to compete as a tag team in the greater New York region throughout 2017 and 2018, and also traveled abroad to compete for Preston City Wrestling in England and Westside Xtreme Wrestling in Germany.  Return to OVW (2009‚Äì2012)  In early 2009, he returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) both to wrestle and to be an assistant trainer. On February 7, 2009, he defeated Idol Stevens and Johnny Punch in a triple threat match to become the new OVW Television Champion. On March 21, Brendli failed a drugs test at an OVW event, and was suspended by the Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Authority.https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2009/03/more-on-former- wwe-stars-failed-drug-test-517474/ He lost the OVW Television Championship to Jamin Olivencia on May 9. After postponing two hearings, he was suspended for six months and fined US$100 on June 29. On November 21, 2009, Mondo teamed with Turcan Celik to defeat Moose and Tilo for the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship. They held the championship for a week, before losing it to The Network on November 28. On May 29, 2010, at All or Nothing, Mondo won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Beef Wellington. He later lost the championship to James Thomas on June 16. On March 5, 2011, Mondo regained the OVW Heavyweight Championship by winning a three-way ladder match, also involving Cliff Compton and \\"Low Rider\\" Matt Barela. Mondo was stripped of the championship on May 4, after attacking OVW president Danny Davis. On November 2, at OVW's episode 637, Christian Mascagni prevented Mondo from winning an eight-man melee, costing him a match for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. = Ring of Honor (2010‚Äì2013) = Mondo appeared at Ring of Honor (ROH)'s Bluegrass Brawl event on July 22, where he lost to Delirious. He returned to ROH at the Ring of Honor Wrestling television tapings on December 9 and 10, defeating Grizzly Redwood the first night, before losing to Colt Cabana on December 10. Mondo in August 2013 In late 2011, Brendli returned to Ring of Honor as a full-time member, under his 'Mike Mondo' personality. After a string of losses to begin his full-time ROH career, he eventually defeated Matt Taven. He then feuded with T.J. Perkins, whom he defeated in their first match together, but lost the second. Making his ROH pay-per-view debut at Border Wars, he teamed with the Young Bucks to lose to Perkins and The All Night Express of Kenny King and Rhett Titus. Following a draw with Davey Richards in May and a win over Mike Bennett at Best in the World 2012: Hostage Crisis, he had his first title opportunity when he unsuccessfully challenged Kevin Steen for the ROH World Heavyweight Championship. Mondo won an ROH World Television Championship number one contendership six-man mayhem match, and faced Adam Cole for the championship at Death Before Dishonor X: State of Emergency in a losing effort. Following the loss, Mondo defeated Kyle O'Reilly in a qualifying match for the 2012 Survival of the Fittest tournament, but lost in the final to Jay Lethal. At Glory By Honor XI: The Unbreakable Hope, Mondo lost to Mike Bennett, suffering a leg injury in the process which sidelined him for several months. Mondo returned in March 2013, forming a tag team partnership with Grizzly Redwood and starting a feud with S.C.U.M.. At Supercard of Honor VII, Mondo, B.J. Whitmer, Caprice Coleman, Cedric Alexander, and Mark Briscoe lost to five members of S.C.U.M. He made a further return at television tapings in April 2017, when he and Kenny unsuccessfully challenged The Young Bucks for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. =Return to WWE (2016)= In late 2016, Brendli, as Mikey, and Kenny returned to WWE for a short storyline with Dolph Ziggler (formerly Nicky in the Spirit Squad). On October 4, on SmackDown, they utilised their Spirit Squad characters to taunt Ziggler about his time in the Spirit Squad, before attacking him at the behest of the Intercontinental Champion The Miz and Maryse. Five days later, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, he and Kenny attempted to distract Ziggler in his career vs. title match against The Miz, but were unsuccessful. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Mikey and Kenny faced Ziggler in a two-on-one handicap match; Ziggler won but was attacked by The Miz before being saved by Rhyno and Heath Slater. This led to a six-man tag team match the following week, which Mikey, Kenny, and The Miz won. Mikey and Kenny unsuccessfully challenged Slater and Rhyno for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship on October 25. They appeared throughout November in tag team matches, before disappearing off television. = Major League Wrestling (2019) = On July 24, 2019, it was announced that Squad members Mondo and Kenny Dykstra were now signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW). They would go on to debut at that month's Never Say Never show.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/mike-mondo- kenn-doane-spirit-squad-join-mlw  Personal life  Brendli played football in middle and high school. Brendli is good friends with his former Spirit Squad teammate Nick Nemeth (better known as Dolph Ziggler), and the two lived together in Florida until 2008. On June 1, 2008, Brendli was arrested for driving under the influence in Florida. He was released the next day after posting US$500 bail.

United States, 221 U.S. 1 (1911), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey guilty of monopolizing the petroleum industry through a series of abusive and anticompetitive actions.. The Court's remedy was to divide Standard Oil into several geographically separate and eventually competing firms. Background By the 1880s, Standard Oil was using its large market share of refining capacity to begin integrating backward into oil exploration and crude oil distribution and forward into retail distribution of its refined products to stores and, eventually, service stations throughout the United States. Standard Oil allegedly used its size and clout to undercut competitors in a number of ways that were considered \\"anti-competitive,\\" including underpricing and threats to suppliers and distributors who did business with Standard's competitors. The government sought to prosecute Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The main issue before the Court was whether it was within the power of Congress to prevent one company from acquiring numerous others through means that might have been considered legal in common law, but still posed a significant constraint on competition by mere virtue of their size and market power, as implied by the Antitrust Act. Over a period of decades, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had bought up virtually all of the oil refining companies in the United States. Initially, the growth of Standard Oil was driven by superior refining technology and consistency in the kerosene products (i.e., product standardization) that were the main use of oil in the early decades of the company's existence. The management of Standard Oil then reinvested their profits in the acquisition of most of the refining capacity in the Cleveland area, then a center of oil refining, until Standard Oil controlled the refining capacity of that key production market. By 1870, Standard Oil was producing about 10% of the United States output of refined oil.Dudley Dillard, Economic Development of the North Atlantic Community (Englewoods Cliffs, N.J.:Prentice-Hall, 1967), pp. 409-410 This quickly increased to 20% through the elimination of the competitors in the Cleveland area. Opinion of the Court As in the case against American Tobacco, which was decided the same day, the Court concluded that these facts were within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The Court recognized that \\"taken literally,\\" the term \\"restraint of trade\\" could refer to any number of normal or usual contracts that do not harm the public. The Court embarked on a lengthy exegesis of English authorities relevant to the meaning of the term \\"restraint of trade.\\" Based on this review, the Court concluded that the term \\"restraint of trade\\" had come to refer to a contract that resulted in \\"monopoly or its consequences.\\" The Court identified three such consequences: higher prices, reduced output, and reduced quality. The Court concluded that a contract offended the Sherman Act only if the contract restrained trade \\"unduly\\"that is if the contract resulted in one of the three consequences of monopoly that the Court identified. A broader meaning, the Court suggested, would ban normal and usual contracts, and would thus infringe liberty of contract. The Court endorsed the rule of reason enunciated by William Howard Taft in Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States (1899), written when the latter had been Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Court concluded, however, that the behavior of the Standard Oil Company went beyond the limitations of this rule. =Concurrence= Justice John Marshall Harlan concurred in the result, but dissented against adopting a \\"rule of reason\\". It departed from precedent that the Sherman Act banned any contract that restrained trade \\"directly.\\"See, e.g., . He said the following: Significance The Standard Oil case resulted in the breakup of Standard Oil into 34 separate companies. Many of these have since recombined, particularly into ExxonMobil. While some scholars have agreed with Justice Harlan's characterization of prior case law, others have agreed with William Howard Taft, who concluded that despite its different verbal formulation, Standard Oil's \\"rule of reason\\" was entirely consistent with prior case law.

The grape is allowed in the Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG) wines of Colli Orientali del Friuli. The grape is most commonly associated with sweet dessert wines often made in the passito style. Historically planted in poor and infertile vineyards, the grape gets its name from the very small stalk, which in friulian language is called pecol√®t or pecol√πt. The grape had a worldwide reputation in the 18th century when it was featured in royal courts from Great Britain to the Russian Empire. While experiencing cult wine popularity in the 1960s & 1970s, Picolit's extremely small yields have made it economically difficult to grow and has limited the number of plantings.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 524 Oxford University Press 2006 It was assumed to be identical with the Hungarian grape variety K√©knyel≈±.Picolit , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-12-03 But in 2006 isoenzymes and microsatellite analyses have confirmed that these two cultivars are different. History While the exact origins of the grape are not clear, Picolit was well known internationally during the 18th century as a favorite of Count Fabio Asquini. The Count oversaw production of more than 100,000 bottles that was exported to the royal courts of the Holy Roman Empire, Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Russia, Saxony and Tuscany as well as the Vatican. Asquini was a pioneer who left diligent notes on his growing and winemaking methods to coax the most out of the limited resources that the Picolit vine produces, but the difficulty in growing the vine led to a sharp decline in plantings. The Perusini family invested many resources during the 20th century to develop new clones that would be easier to cultivate but still retain the desirable characteristics of the grape. While a brief spike in popularity in the 1960s & 1970s did elevate the Picolit wine to cult wine status, the work of the Perusini family is credited with keeping the grape from extinction. The popularity of Picolit wine has led to the illegal practice of blending it with inferior quality Verduzzo to stretch the supply. Wine styles The Picolit grape balance of acidity and sugar lends itself well to dessert wine production. Both late harvest and passito styles are made. With passito wines, the Picolit grapes are normally harvested in mid- October and then dried to raisins on straw mats before pressing. The late harvest styles are picked several weeks later, just before the grapes raisin on the vine. After fermentation, the wine is aged-often in oak barrels. In addition to being served after dinner, the wine is also considered a vino da meditazione or ap√©ritif that can be served alone. Picolit wines tend to be characterized by soft floral aromas with peach and apricot flavors.  Synonyms  Picolit is also known under the synonyms Balafan, Balafant, Blaustengler, Blaustingl Weiss, Kel'ner, Peccoleto Bianco, Piccolet, Piccoletta, Piccolit, Piccoliti Bianco, Piccolito, Piccolito Bianco, Piccolito del Friuli, Piccolitt, Piccolitto, Piccolitto Friulano, Picoleto Bianco, Piculit, Pikolit, Pikolit Weiss, Piros Keknyel√º, Ranful Weiss, Szabo Istvan, Szod Bajor, Uva del Friuli, Weisser Blaustingl, Weisser Ranful, and Wisellertraube Weiss, but none of these is present in Friuli and Italy, except \\"Picolit\\" which is the only guaranteed and protected name.

It was ordered to closure in 2002 and in May 2005 by the Ministry of Culture, Information and Sports, but continued to publish under a variety of titles. In late 2012, before the anniversary of the Mangystau riots, Kazakhstani authorities raided and searched Respublika's office and again suspended its publication, pending a verdict on criminal charges.Al Jazeera English: History Russian journalist Irina Petrushova founded Respublika in 2000. The weekly focused on covering business and economic issues in Kazakhstan, and frequently published stories highly critical of Nazarbayev's regime. The paper wrote about financial scandals and rampant nepotism and cronyism. Scandals the paper exposed included the granting of oil rights to one of Nazarbayev's relatives; the disappearance of funds for an airport in the capital, Almaty; and the Kazakhstani police forcing tourists off a plane so that Nazarbayev's daughter might fly alone. Respublika's most notable story was an expos√© which revealed that Nazarbayev had stashed US$1 billion of the state's oil revenues in a Swiss bank account; the government stated that this had been an emergency fund used to rescue the national economy in 1998. In November 2001, a government representative unsuccessfully attempted to buy a controlling stake in Respublika. In January 2002, Kazakhstani printers began to refuse to print the paper, one after a human skull was placed on his doorstep. A mid-March 2002 court order to stop printing for three months, was evaded by printing under other titles, such as Not That Respublika.Wines 2012 Petrushova bought a digital copier so that Respublika could do its own printing, but then the paper's offices became the target of intimidation and threats. On International Women's Day, a funeral wreath was mailed to Petrushova. On another occasion, a decapitated dog was hung from Respublika building with a screwdriver sticking into its side and a note reading \\"there will be no next time\\"; the dog's head was left outside Petrushova's home. Three days after the dog incident, the papers' offices were firebombed and burned to the ground. In July, Petrushova was given an eighteen-month jail sentence on tax charges, but served no time after a judge ruled that the case fell under an amnesty. Petrushova eventually left the country for Russia, where she continued to publish via the Internet, living apart from her family for their safety. In recognition of her work, Petrushova was awarded a 2002 International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a US-based NGO. =Closure on charges of extremism= In November 2012 Respublika was again ordered closed, \\"along with seven sister titles and 23 news websites, plus another opposition newspaper and a satellite TV station [...] for ‚Äòpropagating extremism‚Äô, inciting unrest and urging the overthrow of the government.\\" Reporters Without Borders described this as a \\"pretext\\" and said it would be the end of pluralism in Kazakhstan.

It frequently cooperates with other libertarian socialist organisations, such as the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation (SUF), although SUF is not a part of SAC.Labyrint performing at the centenary party for the SAC in 2010alt= The SAC was founded in 1910 by disgruntled members of the Social Democratic LO trade union central after its failure to carry out a Swedish General Strike, and were joined by large sections of the youth wing of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, who also had come under the influence of the revolutionary syndicalism of the French Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail. In 1922 the newly formed union confederation also became founding member organisation of the anarcho- syndicalist International Workers Association; however, conflicts erupted between the organisations in the 1950s as SAC set up a state-supported unemployment fund, something which the IWA regarded as state collaboration and reformist. From 1956 and onwards the SAC stopped paying its membership fees to the IWA, effectively letting its affiliation lapse. Today the SAC is affiliated with the Red and Black Coordination, an international network of revolutionary syndicalist and anarcho-syndicalist unions. The traditional strongholds of the SAC were primarily in the forestry, mining, and construction industries. Today the majority of the union's members are employed in the public sector, often working in sectors like railway and public transports, healthcare, and education, but many of the members can also be found in the restaurant, information technology, and logistics industries. Decision making Insignia of SAC Decisions should, according to SAC, be made by those whom it concerns and not by representatives or leaders. That is why they apply federalism, direct democracy and direct action. Decisions about negotiations, notices, offensive actions and agreements are ultimately made by the members of the operational sections. Decisions about using the battle funds are made by the Local Co-organisation (the members thereof, of course). Central notices about offensive action, strikes, and other things exist but they can be annulled locally by local instances. Central vetoes against conflict measures do not exist. Concentration of power is avoided by not letting SAC's employees be eligible for election to positions of confidence or as congress representatives. SAC workers conference, held in √ñrebro November 25-November 26, 1917. The conference decided to plan mass action for 8-hour working day in the spring of 1918. Most workplaces are today covered by collective agreements set up by Landsorganisationen, which apply not only to members of LO, but also other employees of the workplace in question. However, only members of LO are bound by LO's part of the agreement, which means that members of SAC - and, of course, other non-LO trade unions - are free to initiate offensive actions even if the current collective wage agreement includes a no-strike clause. Structure The SAC is structured along two parallel lines , one geographic and the other industrial, a result of influences from organization of the CGT at the time of the founding of the SAC. *Geographical structure Mayday celebration 2011, organized by the Stockholm local federation of the SAC and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation Stockholm, gathering ~4,000 people.Local Co-organisations (Lokala Samorganisationer, LS). The foundation of the geographical structure and the entire movement are the Local Co-organisations organised as locally as possible, preferably one per city and/or municipality. Individual members of SAC are affiliated directly with their nearest Local Co-organisations. As one of the basic tenets of syndicalism is direct and local democracy, the structure of different Local Co-organisations may vary a lot. It is not common to refer to the Local Co-organisation by saying \\"Lokala Samorganisation\\", instead you say \\"LS\\". Districts. Several Local Co-organisations in a geographical area may establish a district, where they can cooperate with, for example, agitation and education. Districts may also function as constituencies for some functionary positions. The Local Co-organisations that make up the district decide what the district should be doing. Central Organisation. Local Co-organisations are members of the federation SAC, the name of the central authority, whose task is principally coordinating and administrative. It is from this central authority the movement has adopted its name. The highest governing body of SAC is the Congress, which is held at least every fourth year, the last being held in 2009. Representatives are sent to the congress from the Local Co-organisations, whose number of members determines how many representatives they may send. Every Local Co-organisation has in advance decided how representatives should act in the questions that are to be decided on the congress, and the representatives are bound to act as such. A central committee (centralkommitt√©, CK) composed by members elected from the districts lead the implementation of the decisions made by the congress and may make decisions on lesser issues. Between the congresses important questions and supplementary elections are made by referendums. The Local Co-organisations are independent in matters and questions concerning them only, and have their own battle funds, even though there is a central battle fund too. *Industry-wise structure Operational section. The Operational section is the foundation of the industry-wise structure. These are organised at workplaces, without regards to occupation on the working place in question, and may go on strike independently of other parts of the organisation if so decided by members of the Operational section. As the name implies, these groupings are to take over the operation of the workplace in the future libertarian socialist society envisioned by SAC. Syndicate. Operational sections belonging to the same industry (in example, health or transport) form syndicates in the city, municipality or other geographic area. Operational sections connected to different Local Co-organisations may join the same syndicate. Federation. Syndicates from all over the country join up to form industry-wise federations. Today, the main purpose of these is to coordinate the cooperation and agitation of the syndicates. The SAC building in central Stockholm, housing the Stockholm Local Federation of the SAC, the SAC secretariat, and the Arbetaren office Secretariat The secretariat of SAC is located in the SAC house on Sveav√§gen 98, Stockholm. The closest subway station is the R√•dmansgatan. The purpose of the secretariat is to co-ordinate the internal and external work of the organisation. Arbetaren and SAC's book publisher Federativs are to be found in the same house.

The names refer to Swedish general Lennart Torstenson and Norwegian governor-general Hannibal Sehested. Denmark had withdrawn from the Thirty Years' War in the Treaty of L√ºbeck (1629). After its victories in the war, Sweden felt it had to attack Denmark due to its advantageous geographical position in relation to Sweden. Sweden invaded in a short two-year war. In the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro (1645), which concluded the war, Denmark had to make huge territorial concessions and exempt Sweden from the Sound Dues, de facto acknowledging the end of the Danish dominium maris baltici. Danish efforts to reverse this result in the Second Northern, Scanian and Great Northern wars failed. Background Sweden had been highly successful in the Thirty Years' War, having defeated Imperial armies in Germany and seen substantial victories under Gustavus Adolphus and after his death, under the leadership of Count Axel Oxenstierna, Lord High Chancellor of Sweden. At the same time, Sweden was continually threatened by Denmark‚ÄìNorway, which almost completely encircled Sweden from the south (Blekinge, Scania and Halland), the west (Bohusl√§n) and the north-west (J√§mtland). The Danish Sound Dues were also a continuing source of irritation and a contributing factor to the war. In the spring of 1643 the Swedish Privy Council determined that their military strength made territorial gains at the expense of Denmark likely. The Count drew up the plan for war and directed a surprise multi-front attack on Denmark in May. Prelude Swedish Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson was ordered to march against Denmark. Proceeding from Moravia, his forces entered Danish territory in Holstein on 12 December and by the end of January 1644 the Jutland peninsula was in his possession. In February 1644, the Swedish General Gustav Horn with an army of 11,000 men occupied much of the Danish provinces of Halland and Scania, except for the fortress town of Malm√∏. War =Denmark= This attack caught Denmark unaware and poorly prepared but King Christian IV retained his presence of mind. He placed his confidence in the fleet to protect the home islands, just winning the Battle of Colberger Heide on 1 July 1644 but suffering a decisive defeat in the Battle of Fehmarn on 13 October 1644 against a Dutch‚ÄìSwedish fleet. He also counted on the forces of Norway to relieve the pressures on Danish provinces in Scania by attacking Sweden along the Norwegian‚ÄìSwedish border. =Norway= Norway, governed by Christian's son-in-law, Governor-General Hannibal Sehested, was a reluctant participant. The Norwegian populace opposed an attack on Sweden, which would only leave them open to counter-attack. Their opposition to Statholder Sehested‚Äôs direction grew bitter and the war was lampooned as the \\"Hannibal War.\\" The Danes cared little for Norwegian public sentiment when Denmark was threatened and Jacob Ulfeld initiated an attack into Sweden from Norwegian Jemtland. He was driven back and Swedish troops temporarily occupied Jemtland and advanced into the Norwegian √òsterdal before being driven back. Sehested had made preparations to advance with his own army and a similar army under Henrik Bjelke into Swedish V√§rmland but was ordered to relieve the King in the Danish attack on Gothenburg. When Sehested arrived the King joined his fleet and performed heroically, even though wounded, preventing Torstensson‚Äôs army from moving onto the Danish islands. On the Norwegian front, Sehested attacked and destroyed the new Swedish city of V√§nersborg. He also sent Norwegian troops under the command of George von Reichwein across the border from Vinger and Eidskog and troops under Henrik Bjelke into Swedish Dalsland. Aftermath The Treaty of Br√∂msebro in 1645. Brown: Denmark‚ÄìNorway; Green: Sweden; Yellow: the provinces of J√§mtland, H√§rjedalen, Idre & S√§rna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and √ñsel, which were ceded to Sweden; Red: the province of Halland, ceded for 30 years Christian's Danish forces were so exhausted that he was forced to accept the mediation of France and the United Provinces in suing for peace. The Peace of Br√∂msebro was signed on 13 August 1645, a humiliating disaster to Denmark‚ÄìNorway. The Swedes were exempted from the Sound Dues, the toll for passing through Danish territory into the Baltic Sea. Denmark‚ÄìNorway ceded to Sweden the Norwegian provinces of Jemtland, Herjedalen and Idre & Serna and the strategically valuable Danish islands of Gotland (Valdemar Atterdag of Denmark had conquered the island from Sweden in 1361) in the center of the Baltic and √òsel in the Baltic Sea. In Dalarna the landsh√∂vding (chief of the land i.e. governor) raised a host of 200 dalecarlian farmers who seized the region of S√§rna, making it de-facto Swedish territory. Sweden occupied the Danish province of Halland as well as other territories for 30 years as a guarantee of the treaty. The Danish heir to the throne, Frederick II, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1634‚Äì1645) and of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635‚Äì1645), had to resign, with the two prince-bishoprics being occupied by the Swedes. According to the Peace of Westphalia both prince-bishoprics became a fief of the Holy Roman Empire to the Swedish crown in 1648. Later events The siege of Brno in 1645, by Swedish and Transylvanian forces led by Torstenson The defeat of Denmark reversed the historic balance of power in the Baltic. Sweden gained domination of the Baltic, unrestricted access to the North Sea and was no longer encircled by Denmark‚ÄìNorway. The surprise attack assured that Denmark‚ÄìNorway now looked for an opportunity to recoup their losses, while Sweden looked for opportunities to expand further, setting the stage for continued conflict on the Baltic over the next century. With Denmark-Norway out of the war, Torstenson then pursued the Imperial army under Gallas from Jutland in Denmark south to Bohemia. At the Battle of Jankau near Prague, the Swedish army defeated the Imperial army under Gallas and could occupy Bohemian lands and threaten Prague, as well as Vienna.

It is an eliminator game in the style of the solitaire game Accordion. The game is so called because the player seems to remove anything that comes between the Queen and the King of the same suit for them to \\"marry.\\" It also goes under the name Matrimony.\\"Matrimony\\" (p.59) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. Rules The Queen of the chosen suit (traditionally the Queen of Hearts) is placed immediately on the table face-up while her corresponding King is placed face-down. The remaining fifty cards are shuffled and placed on the top of the King to form the stock. Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time to the right of the Queen. If a pair of cards with either the same rank or suit are separated by one or two cards, the in-between cards may be discarded. This may result in new opportunities to discard additional cards. Strategy revolves around decisions of whether to discard cards or not. It may be advantageous to retain as many cards of the Queen's suit as possible, as these may be easily eliminated by the King or Queen at any tie, but may be helpful in eliminating other cards. The game is won when the King and Queen are brought together  that is, when only one or two cards remain in between them, which can then be discarded. Variations Royal Marriage is possible to play in-hand, rather than on a surface such as a table. In this case, the deck is held face-down in one hand, with the King being uppermost face-down card and the Queen being held face-up above it. Cards are played from the bottom of the deck onto the Queen, and fanned out to show all cards that could possibly affect play. Alternatively, the Queen can be played on one end of a surface, and all cards dealt out at the beginning to the Queen's right, ending with the King. This allows for an additional measure of strategy: being able to view the entire sequence of cards allows the player to choose which cards to discard and in what order to ensure a win.

Having served in numerous government positions, Baykal led the CHP from 1992 to February 1995, from September 1995 to 1999 and again from 2000 to 2010. Between 2002 and 2010, he also served as the Leader of the Opposition by virtue of leading the second largest party in Parliament. First elected to Parliament in 1973, Baykal went on to serve as Minister of Finance in the CHP-MSP coalition of 1974 and as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in the third government of B√ºlent Ecevit from 1978 to 1979. With the CHP shut down during the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat, Baykal was briefly imprisoned before being elected to Parliament once again in 1987 from the new Social Democratic People's Party (SHP). Baykal was one of the leading members of the re-established CHP, which was founded again in 1992. He served as the party's leader until 1995, when the CHP and SHP merged during a convention. He was re-elected leader in September 1995, after which Baykal contested the 1995 general election and formed a coalition government with Tansu √áiller's True Path Party. He served concurrently as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1995 and 1996. Leading the CHP into a landslide defeat in the 1999 general election, Baykal resigned after the party was entirely ejected from Parliament for failing to surpass the 10% election threshold. Regardless, he was re-elected as leader in 2000 and led the party to a moderate success in the 2002 general election, becoming the Leader of the Opposition. He resigned as leader in 2010 after the release of a video of Baykal's private relationship with another CHP MP. As the oldest MP in Parliament following the June 2015 general election, Baykal briefly served as the interim Speaker of the Grand National Assembly. He was the CHP's candidate to become the permanent Parliamentary Speaker for the 25th Parliament of Turkey in the June‚ÄìJuly 2015 speaker elections, but lost to Justice and Development Party candidate ƒ∞smet Yƒ±lmaz. Following a breakdown of coalition talks after the election, Baykal was offered a ministerial position in the subsequent interim election government formed by AKP leader Ahmet Davutoƒülu, which he turned down in line with the party executive's decision.http://www.internethaber.com/deniz-baykal-bakanlik-teklifine-tarihi- yaniti-809743h.htm He became interim parliamentary Speaker for a second time on 17 November 2015 by virtue of being the oldest MP after the November 2015 general election. He was succeeded by the AKP MP ƒ∞smail Kahraman, who was elected Speaker on 22 November 2015. Early years Baykal was born to H√ºseyin Hilmi and Feride in Antalya. He was educated at the University of Ankara Faculty of Law. He later studied at the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University as a Rockefeller scholar. Following this, he has completed his Ph.D. by 1963 at the University of Ankara Faculty of Political Science. He became an Associate Professor at the same faculty, where he lectured until 1973. Political career before 1980 =Early career= Baykal first become involved in politics during the 1950s, having taken part in student movements opposing the Democratic Party government of Adnan Menderes. He was noticed by senior officials of the CHP after writing a detailed analysis of the party's defeat in the 1965 general election, which would form the basis of his academic thesis that he submitted to become a docent. In the 1973 general election, he was elected as a CHP Member of Parliament for Antalya. At the time of his election, he was the youngest MP in Parliament. =Minister of Finance, 1974= In the short-lived coalition government of B√ºlent Ecevit that had been formed with the Islamist National Salvation Party led by Necmettin Erbakan, Baykal become the Minister of Finance. His tenure would last under a year, with the unlikely partnership between the secular-orientated CHP and the Islamist-orientated MSP collapsing in November 1974. =Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, 1978-79= Baykal become the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in the third cabinet of B√ºlent Ecevit, which lasted from January 1978 to November 1979. The government had a narrow vote of confidence in Parliament due to a loose coalition with independent MPs, the Democratic Party and the Republican Reliance Party. Despite the government maintaining a small majority, the CHP lost ground in the Senate and by-elections held in October 1979, causing Ecevit to resign. At the same time as serving as Energy and Natural Resources Minister, Baykal was also elected to the CHP Party Council and served as both a Central Executive Committee member and a deputy Secretary General of the party. In the party convention held after the disappointing 1979 senate and by-elections, he was heavily critical of the party's established executive. 1980 coup d'√©tat Like many politicians of the 1970s, Baykal was arrested and detained in Ankara, receiving a ban of five years from the military on grounds of political activities. Baykal joined the Social Democracy Party SODEP in 1984. In a constitutional referendum held in 1987, the electorate voted to lift all political bans from the coup-era. As a result, Ecevit, S√ºleyman Demirel and other key politicians of the pre-1980 era returned to politics alongside Baykal. Political career after 1980 =SHP era, 1987= SODEP merged with the Social Democratic People's Party (SHP) in 1987 and Baykal was elected again as an MP from Antalya in 1987 general elections. He was elected to the second chair of the Social Democratic People's Party as the General Secretary in 1988 and served as the party's parliamentary group leader. He stood as General secretary on 10 September 1990, after which he stood against the party's leader Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º three times but failed to win on all occasions. He became the leader of the inner-party opposition to the leadership. During this period, he served as the co-president of the Turkey- European Union inter-parliamentary committee and was a member of the parliamentary foreign policy committee. =Re-establishment of the CHP, 1992= In 1992, with the abandonment of laws prohibiting the re-foundation of former political parties, he led a significant movement and re-established the historical Republican People's Party (CHP), which had been closed down by 1980 military regime. He was elected as the leader of the party. The CHP had entered the 1994 local elections with the political left split between the CHP, SHP and the Democratic Left Party (DSP) of B√ºlent Ecevit. In a party convention held in February 1995, the CHP formally merged with the SHP, while the DSP refused to consider a merger. Baykal did not stand for the leadership in this convention, with Hikmet √áetin being elected leader of the newly enlarged CHP instead. =Coalition government era= Baykal was re-elected as leader of the CHP during a convention in September 1995. He formed a coalition with the True Path Party (DYP), with DYP leader Tansu √áiller as Prime Minister. Baykal subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister and the minister of Foreign Affairs. His one condition for going into coalition was holding an early election, which happened in December 1995. The CHP came fifth with just 10.71% of the vote, and the DYP-CHP coalition lost their majority in Parliament. Despite their poor election performance, Baykal was reelected as leader during the CHP convention of 27 February 1998. In the 1999 general election, the CHP scored below the 10% election threshold needed to win seats in Parliaments, resulting in all CHP MPs being ejected from the chamber. Baykal subsequently resigned as leader and Altan √ñymen was elected in his place. However, he stood again for the leadership against √ñymen in the 2000 extraordinary convention, being elected for a third time as CHP leader. =Leader of the Opposition, 2002-10= Republic Protests against the presidential candidacy of Abdullah G√ºl in 2007 Deniz Baykal meeting President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan in 2015 Baykal led the CHP through the 2002 general election, where the party won 19.38% of the vote and came second. The newly formed Justice and Development Party (AKP), meanwhile, won a landslide majority in Parliament and put an end to years of unstable coalition governments. Baykal subsequently became the leader of the opposition, leading the only opposition party in Parliament. All other parties had fallen short of the 10% boundary, leaving the AKP with 363 and the CHP with 178 seats in the 550-seat Grand National Assembly. Baykal was instrumental in assisting the AKP change the law in order to allow the party's banned leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, to enter Parliament. Erdoƒüan had been banned from public office due to religious intolerance, with the AKP needing 367 votes in Parliament to change the law in Erdoƒüan's favour. The CHP supported the change and Erdoƒüan was elected to Parliament in a by-election in 2003, subsequently taking over from Abdullah G√ºl as Prime Minister. Baykal has always held his ground as a staunch supporter of a strong response to terrorism. Leading his party through the 2004 local elections, the CHP managed to increase their vote share but lost further ground, losing control of Antalya, Baykal's hometown, to the AKP. As a result, the Mayor of ƒ∞stanbul's ≈ûi≈üli district, Mustafa Sarƒ±g√ºl, challenged Baykal for the leadership in an extraordinary convention in January 2005. Although Baykal won the election, the convention was marred by violence between supporters of the two opposing candidates, with Sarƒ±g√ºl being expelled from the party afterwards.http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2005/01/30/siy93.html He first joined the DSP, but later formed the Turkish Change Movement in 2009. Baykal strongly protested the AKP's nomination of Abdullah G√ºl as their presidential candidate for the 2007 presidential election, owing to G√ºl's history in political Islam. The CHP held several Republic protests to rally against the parliamentary process, with CHP MPs boycotting the election process. Due to the 67% quorum needed to elect a President, the AKP was unable to elect G√ºl without the CHP being in attendance. As a result, an early general election was scheduled for July 2007. Baykal joined forces in an electoral alliance with the DSP in time for the 2007 general election, though the two parties combined only marginally improving on their 2002 result, winning 20.88% of the vote. Due to the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) surpassing the 10% threshold, the CHP's seats dropped considerably from 178 to 112. 13 of the 112 MPs were from the DSP, meaning the CHP on its own held 99 MPs in Parliament. However, many DSP MPs joined the CHP after being elected. With the help of the MHP and DSP, G√ºl was elected President despite also suffering a loss in their share of the seats (down from 363 to 341), as there was a quorum of 67% this time. The CHP's moderate vote share increase continued through the 2009 local elections, in which the party won 23.08% of the vote and won back control of Antalya. The AKP lost further ground, most likely due to the 2008 global financial crash occurring a year before the election. Despite presiding over an increase of the CHP's vote share in all elections he contested since 2002, he failed to win any of them. He resigned from the leadership of CHP on May 10, 2010. This was due to criticism of his private life after an alleged video-tape showing him in the same bedroom with his former secretary, and a member of parliament Nesrin Baytok, was leaked to the media. He originally planned to run for the leadership again in the Ordinary Convention of 2010, since many members of the Central Executive Committee insisted that he retake his position as leader. However, with many provincial branch leaders of the CHP endorsing Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu instead, Baykal refused to run for re-election and Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu was elected unopposed. =Political activities since 2010= Baykal was re-elected as an MP in the 2011 and the June 2015 general election. Since he was the oldest member of the newly elected Parliament after the 2015 election, he became the temporary parliament speaker on 23 June 2015. He was the CHP's candidate to become the permanent Parliamentary Speaker for the 25th Parliament of Turkey.

Davutoƒülu had been tasked by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan to form an interim election government after coalition negotiations proved unsuccessful and resulted in Erdoƒüan calling an early election. Since the CHP had 131 MPs during the formation of the interim government, the party was entitled to 5 ministries in the cabinet, though Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu announced that the CHP would not take part and give up their five ministries to independent politicians. Baykal subsequently declined Davutoƒülu's offer, as did the four other CHP MPs that had been offered ministerial positions. His letter of declination was three pages long and was described by himself as an 'equivalent of a historical document'.http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1120521-bakanlik-teklif- edilen-deniz-baykal-haberturke-konustu Re-elected as an MP in the November 2015 general election, Baykal was once again the oldest MP in the newly elected 26th Parliament of Turkey and subsequently became interim Speaker of the Parliament on 17 November 2015.

The rainclouds of the rainout are often formed by the particles of a nuclear explosion itself and because of this, the decontamination of rainout is more difficult than a \\"dry\\" fallout. In atmospheric science, rainout also refers to the removal of soluble species‚Äînot necessarily radioactive‚Äîfrom the atmosphere by precipitation. Factors affecting rainout A rainout could occur in the vicinity of ground zero or the contamination could be carried aloft before deposition depending on the current atmospheric conditions and how the explosion occurred. The explosion, or burst, can be air, surface, subsurface, or seawater. An air burst will produce less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground due to less particulate being contaminated. Detonations at the surface will tend to produce more fallout material. In case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions which become chemically bonded to many surfaces. For subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called \\"base surge\\". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. This surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a fluid. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist. Meteorogically, snow and rain will accelerate local fallout. Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed. Rain on an area contaminated by a surface burst changes the pattern of radioactive intensities by washing off higher elevations, buildings, equipment, and vegetation. This reduces intensities in some areas and possibly increases intensities in drainage systems; on low ground; and in flat, poorly drained areas.

It is a small agricultural community located in Pleasant Valley, a narrow valley just northwest of Fort Collins near the mouth of the Poudre Canyon between the Dakota Hogback ridge and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The ZIP Code of the Bellvue Post Office is 80512. Description The community is lush area on the south side of the Cache la Poudre River, at the mouth of Rist Canyon, concealed from the open Colorado Piedmont near Fort Collins and LaPorte by the Bellvue Dome, also known as \\"Goat Hill\\". The valley formerly stretched southward between the hogback and foothills into the area now inundated by Horsetooth Reservoir. The main agriculture in the valley is cultivation of hay and other crops, as well as cattle and horse ranches. The Colorado Division of Wildlife maintains a large trout hatchery in the valley just north of the Bellvue town site. History Paleoindian sites nearby, including a large bison kill site along the Poudre River, indicate human habitation dating back over 10,000 years. In the early 19th century, the area was inhabited by bands of Arapaho, who clashed regularly in small skirmishes with bands of the Ute tribe who inhabited the mountains. Archaeological remains of teepee rings can be found in the surrounding foothills. The first white settlers arrived in the valley soon after Antoine Janis became the first white settler in northern Colorado in 1858. The farm and pasture lands were squatted upon in the two years that followed, so that most was claimed by G.R. Sanderson, one of these first settlers, who built the first irrigation ditch in the county in June 1860. The ditch was the second one constructed in northern Colorado. Sanderson sold his claim to J.H. Yeager in 1864, and the ditch came to be known as the Yeager ditch. Another early settler, Samuel Bingham, settled on the west slope of Bingham Hill in 1860. In 1860, Abner Loomis, who was also an early prominent resident of Fort Collins, settled on a ranch in the valley. Other early settlers in the 1860s included Benjamin T. Whedbee, Perry J. Bosworth, C.W. Harrington, and Louis Blackstock. In 1873, Jacob Flowers arrived in the valley and set up a homestead on a parcel of land he purchased from Joseph Mason. Flowers had migrated westward from Ohio and Missouri after the Civil War and had settled temporarily in Greeley in 1872. The following year, Flowers followed the Poudre upstream and founded the town of \\"Bellevue\\" later that year (the name was later shortened). The old Bellvue General Store, now the meeting house for Cache la Poudre Grange, Chapter 456 and a community center. The area was considered desirable by the Union Pacific Railroad because of the many stone quarries in the area near the town of Stout (now flooded by Horsetooth Reservoir). The influx of railroad workers to work the quarries prompted Flowers to open a general store, saloon, barber shop, and post office. In 1880 he built a one-story sandstone structure to house his business. The Bellvue Post Office opened in the building on June 24, 1884. The building served as the local general store and post office up through the middle 20th century, when it became the meeting house of Cache la Poudre Grange, Chapter 456 of the Colorado State grange, a designation for which it is now commonly known. Flowers also constructed a track and bandstand south of town that was used for horse racing, community celebrations, traveling medicine shows, and dog and pony shows.

He has illustrated primarily in the field of advertising, but has also provided cover art for music albums, sports magazines (including Sports Illustrated), a children's book, and other commercial endeavors. London Wilson McLean began his career in a London silkscreen studio at fifteen years of age and to date has won most major illustrator awards in the United States. Born in Scotland, he moved to London at the age of ten where he attended St. Martins and the Central School at night while working on the staff of magazines and design studios. This exposed him to the work of American illustrators as well as painters and convinced him that eventually he would go to America. Two years of national service stopped him painting for that period to time. He then went back to the design studios in Fleet Street for a few years doing little of interest, but working on his own drawings at night. Copenhagen At twenty-three, Wilson moved to Copenhagen and the beginning of a freelance career, he also married a Norwegian woman, after a year they moved to Spain, then home to London where he quickly established himself, working with publishing houses, advertising agencies and magazines. New York City He then decided the time was right for New York. 1965 was the year he came to New York for six weeks to try his luck. The first week an agent took him on and he got his first commission from The Saturday Evening Post which he did in a borrowed studio, that was followed by three more magazine jobs which he took back to London. Returning in 1966 with wife and child, he moved to the Upper West Side thinking this would continue as before, but although this was a very creative time in New York and there was no shortage of work in general, McLean experienced several lean years before gaining a reputation. He realized he did not yet have a signature style and point of view and the competition was fierce, so after a couple of years or so experimenting with different mediums and observing more concept oriented pictures, gradually he accomplished a breakthrough in 1973 with important work for Look Magazine, Sports Illustrated and Playboy. His diligence paid off and he worked for a wide variety of clients from advertising, movie posters, record covers, Time Magazine covers, book jackets, annual reports, etc. McLean‚Äôs awards include several silver and gold medals at the Art Directors Club of New York plus the prestigious Clio for television commercials for Eastern Airlines. He won nine silver and four gold medals over the years at the Society of Illustrators in NY and in 1980 the Hamilton King Award for best in show, and gold that same year at the Los Angeles Art Directors Show. Marriage In 1974 he met and later married Rosemary Howard, an ex-model turned photographer. They shared a loft/studio in the Flatiron District of Manhattan and split their time between Southampton and NYC. The Society of Illustrators Gallery in NYC gave him a one-man show in 1978 and a few years later he went to Zurich two summers running to work on lithographs ending in a show of work there in 1984. During the years he has participated in group shows in New York and other parts of the country. He is represented at the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., as well as the National Air and Space Museum in D.C., and in the London Transport Museum‚Äôs permanent poster collection. In 1985, to commemorate European Music Year, the Royal Mail commissioned him to design and illustrate five stamps for a special edition of British composers, and he designed a set of four stamps for the US mail illustrating the Broadway musical Oklahoma! around that same time. McLean contributed to an exhibition and book for the United Nations environmental program entitled Art for Survival. A children's book called If The Earth.. were a few feet in diameter published by the Greenwich Workshop Press which features eighteen paintings is his only experience with that genre. In the year 2000, for the Millennium, the United Kingdom‚Äôs postal service commissioned a stamp, one of a number produced by such people as David Hockney and Eduardo Paolozzi. Teaching His teaching has included Syracuse University, The School of Visual Arts, guest workshops at Savannah College of Art and Design, Ringling College of Art and Design in Florida, as well as workshops throughout the United States. Hudson, New York In 2000 he and his wife moved to Hudson, New York from Long Island and Manhattan. Mclean now lives full-time in Hurley, NY In 2007, McLean had a show of work at the John Davis Gallery in Hudson, New York. And in 2009 a show of Italian landscapes at the Conrad L. Mallett Gallery in Hartford, Connecticut. The Society of Illustrators in 2010 inducted McLean into the Hall of Fame. In 2011 McLean designed and painted the Earth Day poster which the State Department in Washington, D.C. produces each year.

While Cheng Tinhung never claimed to be teaching any particular school of t'ai chi ch'uan, his uncle was a disciple of the Wu school of t'ai chi ch'uan, which may or may not have had some influence on his own approach to the art. The Wudang t'ai chi ch'uan system is now being taught in Europe by two of Cheng Tinhung's disciples, Dan Docherty and Ian Cameron, both based in the United Kingdom. The system also continues to be taught in Hong Kong, and the current head of that school is Cheng Tinhung's son Cheng Kam Yan (ÈÑ≠ÈëëÊÅ©), whose school is called the Hong Kong Tai Chi Association (È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ§™Ê•µÁ∏ΩÊúÉ) and Â§™Ê•µÂÇ≥Êâø Tai Chi Heritage (http://www.hktaichi.com/). Zhang Sanfeng, a highly mythologised figure said to be the founder of t'ai chi ch'uan, lived in the Wudang Mountains and the name \\"Wudang\\" used for this T'ai chi ch'uan system was used in order to acknowledge Zhang Sanfeng's status as the founder of t'ai chi ch'uan. There are other schools of T'ai chi ch'uan that also use this name. The Wudang t'ai chi ch'uan system is also known as ‚ÄúPractical T'ai chi ch'uan‚Äù. This name comes from that given to Cheng Tinhung's style by various Chinese martial arts journalists in Hong Kong during Cheng Tinhung's heyday, and from the school's assertion that its t'ai chi is eminently useful as a form of self-defense. The Wudang t'ai chi ch'uan system teachers publish that they have links to famous T'ai chi ch'uan masters (see lineage diagram), including Yang Banhou, Wu Quanyou, Wu Jianquan, Cheng Wingkwong (Zheng Rongguang, ÈÑ≠Ê¶ÆÂÖâ), Chen Gengyun (Èô≥ËÄïÈõ≤) and Wang Lanting (ÁéãËò≠‰∫≠). Qi Minxuan It is thought that Qi Minxuan (ÈΩäÊïèËªí) came from Wen County, Hebei Dao in Henan Province. He was a teacher of t'ai chi ch'uan and neigong\\"Neigong is a type of martial arts which focus on breathing techniques\\". After losing his family during the Japanese Occupation and Second World War, Qi Minxuan became an itinerant martial arts instructor teaching T'ai chi ch'uan to those that would give him board and lodgings. His father Qi Gechen (ÈΩäÈñ£Ëá£) was a disciple of the famed T'ai chi ch'uan master Wu Quanyou. Qi Minxuan also learnt from a Buddhist monk known as Jing Yi (Èùô‰∏Ä, Tranquil One), who learnt t'ai chi ch'uan from Wang Lanting. Qi Minxuan's Buddhist name was Zhi Meng (Êô∫Â≠ü, Sagacious Elder) and was an enthusiastic student of Chan Buddhism. The fate of Qi Minxuan is unknown. Cheng Tinhung Cheng Tinhung (Zheng Tianxiong, ÈÑ≠Â§©ÁÜä; 1930‚Äì2005). As a young boy he studied Southern Boxing (ÂçóÊã≥) from his father Cheng Minchueng (ÈÑ≠Á∂øÂΩ∞), which was a family style, learnt from his father Cheng Lin (ÈÑ≠È∫ü) who was a professional martial artist. As Cheng Tinhung grew older his uncle Cheng Wingkwong (ÈÑ≠Ê¶ÆÂÖâ) took an interest in teaching him Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Cheng Wingkwong was a formal disciple of Wu Jianquan, who eventually held the rank of Shifu (Â∏´Áà∂, or Sifu in Cantonese) in the Wu family's Hong Kong school. At that ranking he had their encouragement to take on disciples of his own and open his own school. Cheng Wingkwong knew of an itinerant martial artist known as Qi Minxuan whose father was a disciple of the founder of the Wu-style, Wu Quanyou. Cheng Wingkwong arranged for his nephew to train with Master Qi from the summer of 1946 to the winter of 1948. Qi Minxuan advised his new disciple Cheng Tinhung, that in order to gain a good reputation as a master of T'ai chi ch'uan he must be both sound in mind and body and also be able to defend himself, thus being able to represent the art in its true form. Cheng Tinhung later took the nickname of the \\"T'ai chi Bodyguard\\" for his enthusiastic defence of t'ai chi ch'uan as a martial art. By all accounts, Cheng was a hellraiser‚Äîhe liked to drink, eat, and fight as well as train and teach. His predilections may have contributed to the ill health that plagued him in his later years. Dan Docherty Dan Docherty was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1954. He graduated with an LLB in 1974 and soon after moved to Hong Kong where he served as an inspector in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force until 1984 . Soon after he arrived in Hong Kong in 1975 he started training t'ai chi ch'uan under Cheng Tinhung and within a few years was elected to represent Hong Kong in Full-contact Fighting competitions. In 1980 he won the Open Weight Division at the 5th South East Asian Chinese Pugilistic Championships in Malaysia . In 1985 he was awarded a Postgraduate Diploma in Chinese from Ealing College, London. He is now based in London and travels extensively teaching and writing about t'ai chi ch'uan. Mr. Docherty is known for his strong views on the history of t'ai chi ch'uan and is seen as a polarizing figure within the world of t'ai chi. In articles and interviews he has spoken of confrontations with other t'ai chi teachers, including an infamous meeting with one Shen Hong-xun, a master who claimed to have and to teach \\"empty force\\", or the ability to move a person without physical contact. The meeting ended up with Mr. Docherty pouring water over the head of Shen Hong-Xun, not to prove that empty force does not exist but to suggest that Master Shen was unable to summon and use it at that time. Ian Cameron Ian Cameron was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1944. He first came under the tutelage of Cheng Tinhung in 1971 whilst serving in the armed forces in Hong Kong. On his return to Edinburgh he set up his class which was to evolve into the Five Winds School Of T'ai chi ch'uan. Ian Cameron teaches in Edinburgh. He also supervises other classes in Scotland and England. Ian Cameron was born in Edinburgh (Scotland, UK) in 1944. He trained in Tai Chi Chuan with Chen Tin Hung in Hong Kong from 1971 to 1974, and has taught classes now continuously in the UK for over forty years. A student of Judo and Karate from a young age, he was also a keen boxer as a teenager. It was during his time in the Army while serving in Hong Kong he sought out a teacher in martial Tai Chi Chuan, and became a diligent student of Chen Tin Hung. On leaving the armed forces in 1976/77 he began classes in Edinburgh, effectively introducing the style to the UK. He subsequently returned to Hong Kong in 1980 for a month, with the purpose of intensively training with Cheng. Cheng Tin Hung was then Mr Cameron's guest in Scotland the following year, and again in 1985 and 86, teaching seminars throughout the UK. Ian Cameron appeared in Hong Kong newspaper articles with Cheng during the early 70s, and was described in the acknowledgements of Cheng's best known book in the UK (Wutan Tai Chi Chuan) as the ‚Äòelder brother in TCC ‚Äò of Dan Docherty, current president of the Tai Chi Union for Great Britain. Mr Cameron was a founder member of the Tai Chi Union for Great Britain, and sits as Technical Director of that body. He remains a leading practitioner and teacher of Tai Chi Chuan in the UK and continues to fervently defend the traditional approach to Cheng's system of training.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch & Strathspey constituency from 2005 until the general election in May 2015, when he was defeated by Drew Hendry of the Scottish National Party (SNP). In his first parliamentary term (2005‚Äì2010), Alexander was the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Work and Pensions (2007‚Äì2008), the Chief of Staff to party leader Nick Clegg, and Chair of the Liberal Democrat Manifesto Group (2007‚Äì2010). With the 2010 General Election producing a hung parliament, he was one of the four Liberal Democrat MPs, along with Andrew Stunell, Chris Huhne, and David Laws, who were involved in negotiating the coalition agreement for the new coalition government with the Conservative Party.

Early life and education Alexander was born in Edinburgh. As a child he lived on the island of Colonsay where his father was a firefighter, potter and deputy pier master. He attended Colonsay Primary School. The family then moved briefly to South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, and next to Invergarry on the mainland, where he attended Invergarry Primary School. He was then educated at Lochaber High School, Fort William in the Scottish Highlands. He went on to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at St Anne's College, Oxford.Dinwoodie, Robin (31 May 2010) \\"The boy from Colonsay takes on critical job at Treasury\\", The Herald; accessed 11 February 2016. Early career From 1993 to 1994, Alexander worked as a press officer with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, before spending eight years as the Director of Communications at the European Movement (1996‚Äì1999) and its successor organisation, the Britain in Europe campaign (1999‚Äì2004). From 2004 to 2005, he was the head of communications for Cairngorms National Park, considered by some critics as being his \\"biggest job outside of politics\\". Member of Parliament Alexander was elected to the newly formed constituency of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey in the 2005 UK general election. He won the seat from David Stewart, who was previously the Labour MP for Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, the basis of the new constituency. In August 2005, it was revealed that Christopher Haskins, a Labour peer who was a friend of Alexander, had donated ¬£2,500 to Alexander's campaign; subsequently Haskins was expelled from the Labour party for this action. =Front bench spokesman= At the start of the new parliament in 2005, Alexander was appointed by party leader Charles Kennedy as a junior spokesman for Work and Pensions, responsible for disability issues, where he contributed to debates on incapacity benefit reform, the Child Support Agency and the Turner Report on future pension provision in the United Kingdom. From 2005 to 2008, he was also a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. In 2007, he was appointed as Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Social Exclusion for six months, before becoming the party's spokesperson for Work and Pensions, holding the post until June 2008. He gave this post up to focus on his role as chief of staff to the new party leader, Nick Clegg, as well as his responsibility for leading the preparation of the party's election manifesto. =Chief of staff to Nick Clegg= In June 2008, Alexander gave up the Work and Pensions brief to become Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg. As part of his role Alexander became the main author of the 2010 Liberal Democrat general election manifesto and became a confidant of the leader. After the election Alexander became one to the key negotiators in the coalition discussions with the Conservatives and played a key role in the negotiating of the Coalition agreement alongside Oliver Letwin. Coalition Government Following the 2010 general election, Alexander was part of the Liberal Democrats key negotiating team alongside Chris Huhne, David Laws and Andrew Stunell that brokered the agreement to go into a governing coalition with the Conservatives.Haroon Siddique, Profiles: The Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Labour negotiators, The Guardian, 11 May 2010 He was initially appointed Secretary of State for Scotland for the coalition government, then was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury after the resignation of David Laws on 29 May 2010. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010. =Secretary of State for Scotland= Following the negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, Alexander was appointed to the cabinet as the Secretary of State for Scotland making him one of five Liberal Democrats to serve in the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition. As part of his role Alexander was given responsibility to implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission which was to give more fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament, the promise to implement the proposals had formed part of the coalition agreement. See also: Scotland Act 2012 In his first official visit to Scotland in his new capacity Alexander was accompanied by the Prime Minister David Cameron for a series of meetings with the First Minister Alex Salmond. Cameron called for a fresh start in relations between the parliaments in Westminster and Holyrood and committed to appearing every year to answer questions at the Scottish Parliament. Speaking of the coalitions support for the Calman Commission findings Cameron said \\"I believe, and Danny believes, we should be pursuing the Calman agenda. That is a much greater degree of fiscal autonomy for Scotland. I think that is right and that is what we want to put in place\\". Alexander's tenure as Scottish Secretary was short lived, and just over two weeks from his appointment on 29 May 2010 he was promoted to the role of Chief Secretary to the Treasury following the resignation of David Laws. Michael Moore, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, replaced Alexander as Secretary of State for Scotland. =Chief Secretary to the Treasury= The move to the Treasury and the effective number two position to chancellor George Osborne marked his second cabinet post in under a month. The role effectively put Alexander in charge of the government's deficit reduction plan ‚Äì a position of power which he particularly relished. Capital gains tax controversy Two days after being appointed to his new position, the Daily Telegraph newspaper published front-page allegations that Alexander had exploited a legal loophole to avoid the payment of capital gains tax on a property he had sold in 2007 alleging that he had profited from a \\"morally dubious\\" loophole to avoid paying capital gains tax. A few days earlier, the same newspaper had caused the resignation of Alexander's predecessor David Laws after finding irregularities in his expenses claims. The paper suggested that \\"the fact that Mr Alexander has become the second Lib Dem to face questions about his finances within three days has focused attention on whether the party leadership has properly audited the financial activities of its senior figures\\". Alexander had bought the property, a London flat, in 1999 and, after being elected to parliament for a Scottish constituency in 2005, designated the property as his \\"second home\\" while claiming that his first home was now in his constituency. The property was then sold in 2007 for a profit on which he paid no capital gains tax. As the property was the only one he owned, up until 2006, HM Revenue and Customs rules meant that capital gains tax was not payable as should someone find a buyer for their home within three years the property qualifies for relief from [capital gains tax] as long as the property has been the only or main home at some point. Speaking at the time Alexander said \\"I have always listed London as my second home on the basis set out in the parliamentary rules as I spent more time in Scotland than I did in London.\\" The Daily Telegraph stated \\"there is no suggestion that Mr Alexander has actually broken any tax laws\\". 2010 Spending Review Alexander speaking to Sky News in 2010 On 8 June 2010 Alexander and the Chancellor George Osborne announced details of how they would conduct the government's spending review which would set spending limits for every government department for the period from 2011‚Äì12 up until 2014‚Äì15. As part of the review due to be announced on 20 October 2010 a star chamber was established chaired by Osborne and Alexander designed to scrutinise the spending plans of each government department. Shortly after the announcement of how the review would take place, Alexander announced on 17 June 2010 that ¬£2billion worth of projects agreed by the previous Labour government would be cancelled. The projects included an ¬£80million loan to Sheffield Forgemasters and the cancellation of a ¬£25million visitors centre at Stonehenge. Labour attacked the plans as an \\"attack on jobs\\" but Alexander countered by saying that the previous government had gone on a \\"pre-election spending spree in the full knowledge that the government had long since run out of money.\\" Following the announcement on the cancellation of projects, Alexander worked closely with the Chancellor George Osborne to produce an emergency budget on 22 June 2010 which announced a series of measures designed to reduce the United Kingdom's budget deficit. Measures included a rise in the rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% starting in 2011, a rise in Capital Gains Tax from 18% to 28% and the introduction of a levy on the banks designed to raise ¬£2 billion a year. Defending the budget against allegations that it disproportionately hit the poor hardest, Alexander described it as \\"fair\\" and \\"progressive\\" saying \\"this is a Budget that protects the most vulnerable ‚Äì especially children in poverty and pensioners ‚Äì while ensuring those with the broadest shoulders take the greatest share of the burden.\\". Following the budget, and in the period until the spending review, Alexander found himself at the heart of controversial spending decisions made by the government. A series of leaked letters from cabinet ministers showed that the spending review was causing strain within government departments including within the Department of Work and Pensions when a memo from Osborne to Iain Duncan Smith suggested that deep cuts to the welfare budget had already been agreed, prompting accusations by Labour that the cuts were \\"vicious\\" and an attack on the poorest in society. In response Alexander said \\"I am not going to comment on a leaked letter but what I will say is that with welfare spending making up nearly ¬£200 billion, of course it is something we have to look at in the context of the spending review.\\" Further controversy came when the Treasury announced that the Ministry of Defence would have to include the ¬£20 billion replacement of Trident within their budget on top of potential cuts of potentially up to 10 and 20%. Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox later wrote to David Cameron in another leaked letter saying that cuts in defence spending would seriously damage troops' morale. Ken Clarke, the Secretary of State for Justice, said that he was \\"relishing\\" life back at the centre of government and said that the discussions on the spending review he had with Danny Alexander were \\"rather informal but quite intense and serious.\\" On 19 October 2010, the day before the spending review was announced in the House of Commons, Alexander was photographed reading a memo which showed that as a result of the cuts the government would be announcing up to 490,000 public service jobs could be lost. The figure contained within confidential briefing papers came from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). On 20 October 2010, the chancellor George Osborne announced the findings of the review which included the claim from the OBR. Other key points from the review included an average 19% cut in departmental budgets, the desire to eliminate the structural deficit by 2015, ¬£7bn extra in cuts to welfare spending and a move for the retirement age to be increased to 66 for both men and women by 2020. In a letter to Liberal Democrat members Alexander defended the cuts by saying \\"When we came into office, we inherited an economy that was on the brink. With the largest budget deficit in Europe and no plan for tackling it, Britain faced huge economic risks. These could only be dealt with by a clear plan to deal rapidly with the worst financial position this country has faced for generations.\\" Despite the scale of the cuts announced Alexander, in his letter, went on to claim that the burden had been spread fairly by ensuring that key public services relied on by the most vulnerable in society had been protected. He emphasised the announcement of the 'fairness premium' designed to help the poorest children and noted that key transport projects had been given the go ahead as well as the announcement of a green investment bank. Bank lobbying It was reported in the Independent in December 2011 that Danny Alexander had been involved in meetings with bankers lobbying to avoid proposals in the Vickers Report that were intended to reduce risks in the banking industry. The talks were alleged to be secret, but were obtained via a Freedom of Information request. =North Sea oil windfall tax= Alexander caused controversy after giving a speech to a group of businessmen that a ¬£10 billion windfall tax on North Sea oil revenue in the 2011 budget was his idea. The move has been estimated to cost up to 40,000 jobs. =Trident nuclear review= On 22 September 2012, Danny Alexander was appointed by Nick Clegg to review alternatives to like-for-like replacement of the Trident nuclear missile system, after Minister of State for the Armed Forces Nick Harvey left the government in David Cameron's government reshuffle. =Allegations of \\"pork- barrel politics\\" ahead of the 2015 general election= In January 2015, Nick Clegg was accused of a \\"desperate ploy\\" to save Alexander's seat from the SNP by offering the possibility of completing a city deal for Inverness just ahead of the 2015 United Kingdom general election. Highland council had been lobbying for a deal worth up to ¬£300 million to improve tourist and sports facilities. =\\"Yellow budget\\"= The day after approving the last budget of the Coalition as set out by George Osborne, Alexander took the unprecedented step of issuing an alternative fiscal plan for the next Parliament based on Liberal Democrat policy. In a sparsely attended Commons session Alexander announced plans to borrow ¬£70 billion less than Labour and cut ¬£50 billion less than the Conservatives in the next parliament. He was barracked by Labour MPs throughout, who repeatedly alluded to the Red Book containing the official budget unveiled the day before. 2015 General Election In the 2015 General Election, Alexander lost his seat to the Scottish National Party's Drew Hendry, with 31.3% of the vote compared to Hendry's 50.1%. Personal life Alexander married Rebecca Hoar in July 2005 in Chippenham. They have two children. In October 2010, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman mentioned Alexander during her speech at the Labour Party's Scottish Conference, referring to his red hair. She said, \\"Now, many of us in the Labour Party are conservationists and we all love the red squirrel. But there is one ginger rodent which we never want to see again in the Highlands ‚Äì Danny Alexander.\\" The speech generated controversial media attention and Alexander responded stating he was \\"proud\\" of his hair colour. Harman later apologised, admitting her conduct was \\"wrong\\". In November 2012 the Cairngorm Brewery rebranded their beer called \\"Cairngorm Gold\\" as \\"Ginger Rodent\\" with Alexander's agreement and cooperation. This same beer is also exported to Australia where it is called \\"Sheepshaggers Gold\\". The brewery is located in his former constituency. Alexander has been nicknamed \\"Beaker\\" due to his resemblance to The Muppet Show character. Alexander is a self described heavy metal fan.

Maximus SA and Argocom Ltd, both based in the British Virgin Islands. From here, the money went into A.V. Maximus Holding AG, their parent company. Reportedly, A.V Maximus SA's British Virgin Island's affiliate received ‚Ç¨24.8 million and US$91.4 million, while Agrocom received ‚Ç¨15.6 million. The money was the directed into Armoreal Trading GmbH and S.T.A.R.T Management consulting GmbH, among other subsidiaries. Loans between these subsidiaries were then sent to Metallwerke Bender Rhineland, some of it via ITR Information Technology GmbH. Metallwerke Bender Rhineland (MBR) then paid it back through Armoreal trading, ultimately going to A.V. Maximus SA. Money was returned to A.V. Maximus SA as a return on investments, which enabled the money to be legally wired to A&P; Power Ltd via A.V. Maximus Holding AG. A&A; Poweris owned by A&P; Power Holdings Ltd, which is housed in Nevis. Aliyev moved to Malta with his second wife Elnara Shorazova; the two allegedly began to dissolve and reorganize their money laundering network. MBR was sold to a Dubai-based company in March 2010. Armoreal Trading was liquidated in December 2010 while an Austrian company known as Veitlissen transferred 2.4 million Euro to A&P; Power Ltd. In March 2011, A.V. Maximus Holding was sold to A&P; Power Ltd and renamed Zurich Asset management. In 2005, the investigation into this arrangement began when Wiesbaden were reportedly alerted about Armoreal Trading's suspicious loan activity. Nothing came of the complaint and the issue lay dormant until spring 2007, when three Austrian banks, Schoellerbank AG, Privitnvest Bank AG and M&A; Privatbank AG, reported transactions involving Aliyev's company to the Austrian Interior Minister. The timing of these reports coincided with the divorce of Aliyev with his first wife, the daughter of the President of Kazakhstan, and his falling out of favour with the ruling family. All of his enterprises‚Äô bank accounts were then blocked. The money originated in the late 1990s, when Aliyev was head of the tax office in Kazakhstan. According to reports, Aliyev amassed a large fortune through defrauding a variety of companies and services while enjoying protection as son-in-law of the President, one of which was the Kazakhstani state soccer team. All of the financial interests were placed inside START Management consulting GmbH, a Viennese-based firm. Between March 2006 and January 2007, ‚Ç¨1 million in sponsorship money disappeared from START accounts. Despite this, the contract between the two companies was renewed in early 2007 and 403,000 euros were transferred to START's account. =Treason= The Kazakhstan government found Aliyev guilty of treason for attempting a coup against the Kazakh president. =Torture= Aliyev allegedly tortured the two bodyguards of Akezhan Kazhegeldin to get them to confess to a coup d'√©tat. The two men, lbrayev and Afanasenko, claimed that in April 2000, Aliyev tortured them for a total of 48 hours wanting them to confess that Kazhegeldin had been plotting a coup in Kazakhstan against Nazarbayev. According to the lawyer of the two accusers, Lothar de Maiziere, they addressed law enforcement of Malta demanding a criminal case but the authorities allegedly never followed through. =Murder= Aliyev was accused of killing the Kazakh opposition leader, Altynbek Sarsenbayev in February 2006 according to Kazakh prosecutors. In December 2013, prosecutors reportedly released findings that Aliyev ordered the assassination. January 2014, the office filed a notion to start a new case against Aliyev and the former head of National Security of Kazakhstan, Alnus Masayev, related to the involvement in the opposition leader's murder as well as his bodyguard and his lawyer. Aliyev reportedly kidnapped two managers of Nurbank in 2007; their bodies were found in 2011. In 2008, the Kazakh court convicted him in absentia of commissioning the double murders. In addition, Aliyev reportedly also tortured and killed a 23-year-old TV presenter Anastasiya Novikova. According to reports, Novikova's family lost contact with her in 2004, but waited for three years before reporting her missing, on 26 July 2007. Letters obtained between and her family identified Aliyev as the father of her daughter. Novikova reportedly married Danijar Esten of the Kazakh Embassy in Vienna to cover for Aliyev's dalliance. The daughter was taken away from Novikova shortly after her birth. Aliyev denied the allegations against him and said they are politically motivated.\\"Updated: Kazakh Exile Rakhat Aliyev Denies Allegations of Torture by Former Bodyguards\\" Times of Malta, Valletta, 30 October 2013 =Kidnapping= See also The Nurbank Murder Case In addition to the Nurbank managers' kidnapping, Aliyev reportedly was accused of kidnapping Artem Mikoyan Yarikov, a Russian TV executive working in Kazakhstan the mid 1990s. Artem Mikoyan Yarikov allegedly saw Aliyev in a restaurant in Italy where Aliyev acted like nothing happened while Mikoyan Yarikov appeared disturbed by this sight. Charges Aliyev fled to Austria when he was being investigated for the murder of the two Nurbank managers. Before he was arrested, he was quickly appointed the new Kazakh ambassador to Austria on 9 February 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country. While in Austria, Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazakh President, Nursultan Nazarbayev. A full domestic Kazakh investigation began in May 2007 into Aliyev's activities. As a result, his diplomatic passport was cancelled, as was his diplomatic immunity. Kazakhstan filed its first extradition request with Austria at this time. The domestic Kazak investigation concluded in January 2008 with Kazak courts sentencing Aliyev to 40 years of imprisonment in absentia. His crimes were kidnapping, treason and plotting a coup d'√©tat against his father-in-law Nursultan Nazarbayev. According to reports, \\"Kazakhstan requested his extradition from Austria twice, but was denied on both accounts, since Austria was unsure that Aliyev would get a fair trial in his home country.\\" He married to Austrian citizen Elnara Shorazova and enjoyed free movement throughout Europe although being investigated on fraud charges in the Austria, Germany and Malta. European Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told reporters that the investigation on fraud charges was difficult because of the different criminal legislation within the European Union countries. According to reports, in November 2013 Aliyev tried to open a bank account in Cyprus with an invalid account which alerted authorities. The following January, two members of the European Parliament made public calls to the European Commissioner to get Eurojust and Europol to assist with the ongoing criminal investigations. In 2013, Aliyev's Austrian passport was canceled by the decision of Austrian Minister of Interior. He allegedly wanted to obtain citizenship in Cyprus because it was becoming \\"too hot\\" in Malta because of all the investigations. Arrest Aliyev was arrested in June 2014 after he allegedly turned himself into authorities to cooperate with the murder investigation of the two bankers. His lawyer confirmed the arrest and said it took place at 11pm on 5 June 2014 on his way to the airport. =Prison= On 4 July 2014, Aliyev had been moved to a secure prison cell because of repeated attacks and threats by other inmates. He allegedly is forced to share a cell because of fear he might commit suicide. According to his lawyer, Manfred Ainedter, Aliyev complained that the other prisoners were asking for thousands of euros to leave him alone. =Protest= An international movement called JusticeForNovikova.com began with the intention to bring Aliyev to justice for killing Anastasiya Novikova. The group's participants range from ‚Äúindependent human rights activists, advocates of victims of domestic violence, women‚Äôs rights activists, and criminal justice activists.\\" According to their website, the project is ‚Äúan informal international social networking project‚Äù with \\"no formal organizational affiliation.‚Äù The movement began on 19 June 2014, the 10-year anniversary of Novikova's death. On that day protest were held at Lowndes Square. Aliyev denounced the Justice for Novikova protesters as agents of the Kazakh secret services.\\"The KGB's Successor Is Using Forged Documents to Deceive the West\\" Forbes, 3 September 2014. Victimization Aliyev denied all charges against him. According to reports, he claimed that he was prosecuted by the Kazakh government and think people after him are \\"in bed with Kazakhstan.\\" According to an interview, he said that \\"criminal accusations that the regime has tried to hang on him are all fiction.\\" He also said in the same interview that all the charges were \\"made up primarily by the leadership of the National Security Committee, the prosecutor general, the interior minister, and the whole power bloc of ministries. He said that all his trials and sentencing were politically motivated and told newspapers that he would be willing to appear in Austrian courts, but feared that he would be kidnapped. He also reportedly called the lawyer, Gabriel Lansky, who had been helping the bankers' widows and their campaigns to bring justice, as \\"fronts of the Kazakh regime.\\" Aliyev was reported to have circulated forgeries of documents to defame those he sees as critics, including former British prime minister Tony Blair, former U.S. president Bill Clinton, former Austrian chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer and current President Heinz Fischer, former Polish president Alexander Kwa≈õniewski, former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi, and former German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der\\"The KGB's Successor Is Using Forged Documents to Deceive the West\\" Forbes, 3 September 2014 =Skype calls= However, according to Die Presse newspaper, Austrian authorities found Skype calls that undermine his claims. The obtained calls allegedly discussed the disappearance of the two Nurbank bank managers and the location of the bodies. In addition, his alibi during their disappearance was reportedly also discussed. The Skype calls also purportedly recorded Aliyev directing the fabrication of a specific forged document to discredit former British prime minister Blair and former Austrian chancellor Gusenbauer. Aliyev vs Nazarbayev On 9 February 2007, President Nursultan Nazarbayev appointed Aliyev as Ambassador of Kazakhstan in Austria and Permanent Representative to the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) and other international organizations in Vienna. The move occurred days after Aliyev became embroiled in a controversy over the disappearance of two former executives of the Kazakh bank Nurbank. 6 February 2007 the Financial police said they were investigating two former managers (both resigned from their position on 22 January 2007) of Nurbank on suspicion of fraud. After the permission of President Nazarbayev to Kazakh law enforcement bodies to investigate this criminal case ‚Äúwithout regard for rank‚Äù, Aliyev was accused of abduction and extortion at the end of May 2007. On 22 May, Nursultan Nazarbayev signed constitutional amendments that effectively allow him to become president-for-life, a move denounced by the opposition. Aliyev joined the chorus of critics, saying the amendments threaten to torpedo Kazakhstan's OSCE chairmanship bid. Aliyev accused Nazarbayev of \\"de facto usurping\\" power. Following Aliyev's denial and claims that he had fallen victim to political repression, Nazarbayev on 26 May issued decree No. 333 stripping his son-in-law of all official positions. Two days later, the Interior Ministry issued a new statement saying an international arrest warrant had been issued and investigators had been dispatched to Vienna, site of the OSCE's headquarters, to nab him. The new statement said charges involving criminal association, economic crimes, and kidnapping had been brought against Aliyev. 26 May 2007, Rakhat Aliyev was relieved of his position as Ambassador to Austria and stripped of his diplomatic immunity. Rakhat Aliyev was also accused of kidnapping a Russian TV executive working in Kazakhstan, Artyom Mikoyan, in the mid-1990s. and locked Mikoyan up in a basement where he kept him and said to Mikoyan that if he will give him all of the money that he made from his position (estimated 20 million), he will release and to tell no one about the incident. Artem Mikoyan fortunately managed to escape from Aliyev to Moscow and never to come back to Kazakhstan again. On 30 May, the Kazakh government formally asked Austria to arrest Aliyev for kidnapping and extradite him to Kazakhstan. Arrest warrants were being issued for others in the inner circle of this once-powerful man. On 30 May 2007 his diplomatic immunity was removed. In a statement, Aliyev described the charges as absurd and said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt. On 7 August 2007 a Vienna court rejected a request from Kazakhstan to extradite Aliyev and ruled against extraditing the son-in-law of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was wanted on charges of kidnapping. The court said the Rakhat Aliyev would not be given a fair trial in his home country and his human rights could not be guaranteed if he were sent back home. A criminal case against Aliyev and his accomplices ended in mid January 2008: abduction of three top managers of Nurbank in January 2007, the whereabouts of two of them is still unknown, and formation of an organized criminal group found guilty in raiding and document forgery. Almaty district court of Almaty sentenced Aliyev in absentia to 20 years in a high security prison with confiscation of property in this abduction case. The court also sentenced other people to lengthy prison terms. At the end of March 2008 Akmola Garrison Military Court found Rakhat Aliyev as a key person involved in preparations for a coup d'√©tat and sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment. Aliyev's sidekick Musayev, the ex- KNB chief, was also sentenced to 20 years of prison term. Aliyev and Musayev were found guilty under the following articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Article 168, Section 1 \\"Seizure of power through violence,\\" Article 235, Section 4 \\"Formation and heading of an organized criminal group,\\" Article 172, Section 4 \\"Illegal acquisition, disclosure of state secrets,\\" Article 176, Section 3 \\"Embezzlement of some other's property,\\" Article 251, Section 3 \\"Illegal trafficking of arms, ammunition and explosives,\\" Article 255, Section 4 \\"Stealing of ammunition and explosives\\" as well as Article 380, Section 2 \\"Abuse of powers.\\" On 17 June 2011, the Vienna Provincial Court for Criminal Matters rejected a second request for extradition by Kazakhstan because it was not free from doubt that Mr Aliyev would not be persecuted on political grounds in Kazakhstan.\\"Wiener Gericht lehnt Auslieferung Alijews ab\\" Die Presse, 17 June 2011 (online edition) Kazakhstan requested extradition to enforce the previously rendered convictions by the Almaty district court and the Akmola Military Court (see above). In 2013, Aliyev published a book Godfather-in-law, in which he accused Nazarbayev of being responsible for the murders of the opposition leaders. Divorce and Remarriage On 13 June 2007, Aliyev was divorced from his wife, Dariga. He claimed that the divorce was carried out without his knowledge or consent.\\"Nazarbayev's Son-in-Law Is Divorced\\" Moscow Times, 13 June 2007 \\"Today I received the information where it says I am divorced,\\" Aliyev said Monday. \\"They stuck a fax with the information through the fence at my home at a quarter past midnight. ...

His efforts in unifying the petty kingdoms of Norway resulted in the first known Norwegian central government. The country, however, soon fragmented and was collected into one entity in the first half of the 11th century, and Norway has retained a monarchy since that time. Traditionally, it has been viewed as being ruled by the Fairhair dynasty, though modern scholars question whether the eleventh century kings and their successors were truly descendants of Harald. Fairhair dynasty, traditional and modern views According to the traditional view, Norway was the hereditary kingdom of the 'Fairhair' dynasty, agnatic (patrilineal) descendants of the first unifier-king, Harald Fairhair. The successors to the throne after year 872 were all placed by among Harald's male descendants in historical accounts from centuries later. In the 13th century, the kingdom was officially declared hereditary by law, in contrast with the other Scandinavian monarchies which were elective kingdoms in the Middle Ages. Harald Fairhair was the first king of all Norway, bringing the lands of what had previously been several distinct petty-kingdoms under his control. The foundation of this unified Norwegian kingdom is traditionally dated to 872, when he defeated the last petty kings who resisted him at the Battle of Hafrsfjord, though the consolidation of his power took many years. Fairhair's kingdom spanned the coastal areas north to Tr√∏ndelag, but upon his death the kingship was fragmented back into the petty kingdoms, most being held by Harald's sons, descendants or allies, though there were also districts in the hands of other dynasties, such as Ladejarls. Nonetheless, the concept of control by a central power had come into existence. It remains disputed the degree to which Norway should be viewed as an hereditary kingdom under Fairhair's sons and successors, Eric I of Norway and Haakon I of Norway. Some historians emphasize their inability to exercise actual monarchical control over the country and assert that St. Olav (Olaf II), who reigned from 1015, was the first king since Fairhair to control the entire country. Olav is traditionally held to be the driving force behind Norway's final conversion to Christianity. He was later also revered as Rex Perpetuum Norvegi√¶ (Latin: eternal king of Norway).History of Norway from the Norwegian government web site Retrieved 21 November 2006 Only under half-brothers Olav II and Harald III would succession begin to be determined by rules of inheritance, rather than the crown simply being taken by force. Mainland Norway during the reign of Saint Olav c. 1020 AD. The Finnmarken (\\"Marches of the Sami\\"), most of which paid tribute to the kings of Norway, are shown in pink. The Fairhair dynasty may, however, be an artificial construct. The murder of king Harald Greycloak in 970 brought an end to the rule of the immediate family of his grandfather, Harald Fairhair, and Norway was ruled instead by the Danish king and his proxies for 25 years. Olav I of Norway, who had been raised overseas in obscure circumstances, forcibly conquered the kingdom. His death resulted in another 15-year period of Danish rule before the successful Viking raider, Olav Haraldson in turn conquered the kingdom and was succeeded by his son and then by his half- brother, Harald Hardr√•de, himself a famous Viking. The later heroic sagas would give each of these three warrior kings distant descents from Harald Fairhair. However, it has been proposed (most vociferously by Claus Krag) that the genealogical lines connecting Harald Fairhair via otherwise obscure individuals to Olav I, Olav II and Harald Hardr√•de are a political fiction, founded on a later attempt to legitimize their rule and that of Hardr√•de's descendants, as well as to provide a claim to the region of Viken (the area around the present-day Oslo), a claim challenged by the Danes. Adherents of this proposal consider Harald Hardr√•de to be the first king of the lineage that would later rule the realm, and that his claim at the time rested solely on being maternal half-brother of Olav II, and not a distant descent from Fairhair. Descent from the same mother was not in Germanic understanding a proper dynastic tie, and thus Harald Hardr√•de's legitimacy necessitated the fabrication of unbroken male line descents for him and his two predecessors from Fairhair. These fabricated descents are what would appear in the pseudo- historical sagas of Heimskringla. The H√•rdr√•de and the Sverre dynasties Under Harald H√•rdr√•de Norway was firmly established as an independent kingdom and all later kings would claim to be descendants of him. With a few notable exceptions all successful claims are well supported and not disputed by modern historians. This succession of kings is sometimes called the ‚ÄúH√•rdr√•de √¶tten‚Äù to distinguish them from the certain issue of Harald Fairhair. If H√•rdr√•de is accepted as a descendant of Fairhair this dynasty would be just a branch of a larger Fairhair dynasty. The kings themselves are not known to have referred to their dynasty with any official name. Until the 13th century there were no clearly defined succession laws. Instead the succession was based on customs with origins in old Germanic traditions: The situation followed loosely agnatic seniority and agnatic succession with some elements of elective monarchy. All patrilineal male descendants of Harald H√•rdr√•de were entitled to share the kingship. This included sons born outside marriage and many kings had semi-official concubines. To formally become king the candidate had to be hailed at the thing ‚Äì though he would naturally make sure to have the assembly's support before launching his candidacy. The sources do not record any instance of a candidate being turned down by a thing after demanding to be hailed. As kingship gradually took shape as an institution a few things, particularly √òreting in Tr√∏ndelag, received a special status as the places the new king was hailed. The result of these customs was that brothers and half- brothers would inherit the throne to rule jointly, but such arrangements rarely lasted. As a result, succession was generally a matter of conflict, intrigue, and at times minor civil war. From the 1130s, strifes escalated to a more or less continuous civil war until 1240. Norwegian kingdom stretching over the Atlantic Ocean. However, during the reign of the H√•rdr√•de branch of the dynasty, it was generally agreed that only patrilineal male descendants of King Harald III, were entitled to the kingship. Many of the claims by later royal pretenders to belong to the Fairhair dynasty are obvious falsehoods (most notably that of Sverre Sigurdsson). 1163, Magnus V of Norway, the son of a daughter of a previous ruler, ascended to the throne. He was supported by the church, but despite initial success, and the first example of a codified law of succession (allowing his own cognatic heirship), he was overthrown by putative male-line members of the old royal dynasty. In the 13th century, the kingdom was officially declared hereditary by king Haakon Haakonsson, through a succession system that was based on primogeniture. It was also under Haakon Haakonsson, himself the illegitimate son of king Haakon Sverresson, that legitimacy of birth became a factor in the line of succession. Haakon's eldest son, Sigurd, was accordingly bypassed by Haakon's legitimate sons, Haakon and Magnus. In the tradition of the Germanic monarchy the king had to be elected by a representative assembly of noblemen. Men eligible for election had to be of royal blood; the eldest son of the previous king was not automatically chosen. During the civil war era the unclear succession laws and the practice of power-sharing between several kings simultaneously gave personal conflicts the potential to become full-blown wars. Over the centuries kings consolidated their power and eventually a strict succession law made Norway a principally hereditary kingdom. As a result of the unions with Denmark and Sweden, the heredity principles were several times flouted in the succession to the throne, until they were explicitly abolished in 1450. Unions with Denmark and Sweden After the extinction of the male lines of the perceived Fairhair dynasty in 1319, the throne of Norway passed through matrilineal descent to Magnus VII, who in the same year became elected as king of Sweden too. In 1343 Magnus had to abdicate as King of Norway in favour of his younger son, Haakon VI of Norway. The oldest son, Eric, was explicitly removed from the future line of succession of Norway. Traditionally Norwegian historians have interpreted this clear break with previous successions as stemming from dissatisfaction among the Norwegian nobility with Norway's junior position in the union. However it may also be the result of Magnus' dynastic policies. He had two sons and two kingdoms and might have wished they should inherit one each, rather than start battling over the inheritance. Magnus was at the same time attempting to secure Eric's future election as King of Sweden. The Black Death of 1349‚Äì1351 was a contributing factor to the decline of the Norwegian monarchy as the noble families and population in general were gravely affected. But the most devastating factor for the nobility and the monarchy in Norway was the steep decline in income from their holdings. Many farms were deserted and rents and taxes suffered. This left the Norwegian monarchy weakened in terms of manpower, noble support, defence ability and economic power. After the death of Haakon VI of Norway in 1380, his son Olav IV of Norway succeeded to both the thrones of Norway and Denmark and also claimed the Kingdom of Sweden (holding its westernmost provinces already). Only after his death at the age of 17 his mother Margaret managed to oust their rival, king Albert, from Sweden, and thus united the three Scandinavian kingdoms in personal union under one crown, in the Kalmar Union. Olav's death extinguished yet one Norwegian male royal line; he was also the last Norwegian king to be born on Norwegian soil for the next 567 years. After the death of Olav IV of Norway in 1387, the closest in line to the succession was the Swedish king Albert of Mecklenburg. However, his succession was politically unacceptable to the Norwegians and Danes. Next in line were the descendants of the Sudreim lineage, legitimate descendants of Haakon V of Norway's illegitimate, but recognized daughter Agnes Haakonardottir, Dame of Borgarsyssel. However, the candidate from this lineage renounced his claim to the throne in favour of Eric of Pomerania, Queen Margaret's favoured candidate. The succession right of this lineage resurfaced in 1448 after the death of King Christopher, but the potential candidate, Sigurd Jonsson, again renounced his candidature ‚Äì see Sudreim claim. Eric's succession was one in a line of successions which did not precisely follow the laws of inheritance, but excluded one or a few undesirable heirs, leading to Norway formally becoming an elective kingdom in 1450. Starting with Margaret I of Denmark, the throne of Norway was held by a series of non-Norwegian kings (usually perceived as Danish) who variously held the throne to more than one Scandinavian countries, or of all of them. In 1440, the Norwegian privy council reluctantly deposed king Eric III (1383‚Äì1459), after Denmark and Sweden had done the same. The nearest heir to throne was Eric's cousin, Bugislav, but the succession-laws were overlooked because of the necessity to choose the same king as Denmark and Sweden. Christopher of Bavaria was therefore chosen as Norwegian king. In 1448 when Christopher died without close heirs, the union between Sweden and Denmark dissolved, as the two countries chose different kings. Sweden chose Charles Knutsson Bonde, while Denmark chose Christian of Oldenburg (Christian I of Denmark). Norway was thus left with a dilemma. Once again, hereditary rights seem to have had little influence over the decisions made (according to feudal inheritance, the Duke of Mecklenburg would have been closest in rights, and Duke Adolf of Schleswig-Holstein as head of next branch, who however had supported his nephew Christian's election). Sigurd Jonsson, of the Sudreim- line, a descendant of Haakon V of Norway, seems to have been mentioned as a candidate, but turned the offer down. The Norwegian nobility then split between supporters of king Charles of Sweden and King Christian of Denmark. Charles succeeded in being crowned king of Norway in Trondheim in 1449, but in 1450 agreed to renounce the Norwegian throne to King Christian of Denmark in a separate peace deal with Denmark. The Norwegians were not a party to this decision, but were left with Christian as their only candidate. He was crowned in Trondheim the same year. Thus, the House of Oldenburg was first introduced to the Norwegian monarchy. In a union treaty, drawn up by the privy councils of Norway and Denmark in Bergen in 1450, it was specified that Norway was to be an elected kingdom, and have the same king as Denmark in perpetuity. On the death of the king, the Norwegian and Danish privy councils would meet and elect the new king among the previous king's legitimate sons. If no such son existed, the choice was free, but the councils should not part until they had agreed on a common king.Diplomatarium Norvegicum (volumes I-XXI) Denmark‚ÄìNorway King Frederick III On 6 June 1523, Sweden left the union for good, leaving Norway in an unequal union with a Danish king already embarked on centralising the government of the Union. In the following centuries the Norwegian monarchy was characterised by a king mostly residing abroad. This weakened the monarchical governing structures of Norway; the Riksr√•d, for example, was gradually undermined as the Norwegian nobles were not able to enjoy the King's confidence to the same extent as their Danish counterparts. The King was also less able to govern according to Norwegian needs as the distance meant he and his advisors had less knowledge of the conditions in Norway. The history of power during the Danish era Retrieved 21 November 2006 Norway was one of few countries where the archdiocese was coterminous with the national territory. The church was therefore an important factor in trying to maintain the separate Norwegian monarchy. In the 16th century the power struggle between the Norwegian nobles and the king culminated at the same time as the Protestant Reformation. This prompted an unfortunate set of events in which the struggle against the Danish dominance in Norway was coupled with the struggle against the reformation. When both failed the effects were harsh. The Norwegian Catholic bishops were replaced with Lutheran bishops. The Norwegian Riksr√•d was de facto abolished in 1536/1537 and more and more foreign men were appointed to important positions in Norway. In 1661, Frederick III introduced absolute monarchy in Denmark and Norway and introduced a new law, the Lex Regis in both countries to that effect. In this law the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were proclaimed to be hereditary. Emerging independence The Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814. During the Napoleonic Wars the King aligned Denmark‚ÄìNorway with France. When Napoleon lost the war Denmark was forced to cede Norway to the king of Sweden under the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. It was initially proposed that the Norwegian dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroes would remain with Norway, but that point was dropped during the negotiations so they became Danish.History of Norway on historyworld.com Retrieved 21 November 2006 On hearing news of the treaty, Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark and Norway, the resident viceroy in Norway, participated in founding a Norwegian independence movement. The independence movement was successful, partly due to clandestine support from the Danish Crown, but also because of the strong desire for independence in Norway. On 10 April, a national assembly met at Eidsvoll to decide on a constitution. Norway eventually declared independence on 17 May 1814, electing Christian Frederik as King. A short war with Sweden later that year ended with the Convention of Moss. This led to the ousting of Christian Frederick, and the Norwegian Storting electing Charles XIII of Sweden as King of Norway, creating the union between Sweden and Norway. In turn the king recognised the Norwegian constitution which was only changed to facilitate the union. The end result was that the Norwegian monarchy became a constitutional monarchy. In this new union the King was much more a King of Norway than under the previous Danish system. Norway was not to be treated as a Swedish conquest but rather as an equal party in a union of two independent states. Both the principle and substance of the Norwegian Constitution were accepted, and Norway retained its own parliament and separate institutions, except for the common king and foreign service. The only area of policy not in the hands of the Norwegians was foreign policy. Norway had been brought along into the new developments of the world as they arrived in Denmark. However, with the break the Norwegians were able to forge a more progressive political development than was the case in Denmark. Denmark introduced a constitutional monarchy 35 years after Norway. Parliamentarism was introduced in 1884 in Norway, 17 years before Denmark and 33 years before Sweden.The introduction of parliamentarism is not as clear cut in Denmark and Sweden as in Norway. In Denmark the year 1901 is usually given, but the years 1905 and 1920 are also important in this respect. In Sweden parliamentarism was re-introduced in 1917. The union with Denmark also had its adverse effects on the monarchy, among other things it resulted in the crown of Norway experiencing a loss of territory which today amounts to 2,322 755 km¬≤.This number is found by adding up the areas of J√§mtland, H√§rjedalen, Bohusl√§n, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Shetland and Orkney. The entire area of Greenland was not effectively controlled by anyone at the time, however it is today under the Crown of Denmark and therefore would have been under the Crown of Norway. However, Norway's territorial size has been more than restored due to Norwegian expansionism in the early 20th century, which led to the annexation of Queen Maud Land (1939) in Antarctica, an area comprising roughly . Very few royal undertakings had been located to Norway and the country is thus lacking the monumental palaces of the period as can be seen in Copenhagen and other parts of Denmark. The Norwegian Storting would propose laws based in Norway and the King would even on occasion enact laws unfavourable to Sweden. As the Norwegian movement towards full independence gained momentum the King approved the building of forts and naval vessels intended to defend Norway against a Swedish invasion. The union was nevertheless marked by the Norwegians' constant and growing discontent with being in a union of any kind. The Storting would propose laws to reduce the king's power or to assert Norwegian independence. This would most often be vetoed by the king, but as he only had the right to veto the same law twice it would eventually be passed. Already in 1814 the Norwegians instituted a separate flag, this would remain an issue until the union badge was discarded from the Norwegian flag in 1898. In 1837, local self-government in certain areas of policy was introduced in rural areas as well as towns. Parliamentarism was introduced in 1884. Quite often, crown princes of the dynasty served some time in the position of Viceroy of Norway at Oslo, as sort of training for their future reign. Charles II, as he was officially known in Norway, was succeeded in both kingdoms by his adopted son Charles III John of Norway, the first Bernadotte. He had no known genealogical roots in Norway, but he had his son and heir, the future Oscar I of Norway marry Josephine of Leuchtenberg, a descendant of the earlier kings Christian II and Frederick II, and thus descending from all their ancestors too. Her sons, Charles IV and Oscar II, were thus issue of the so-called Fairhair dynasty. It also has to be said that the Royal House tried harder to be a Norwegian Royal House as well. The Royal Palace in Oslo was built during this period. There were separate coronations in Trondheim as stipulated in the Constitution. The royal princes even had a hunting lodge built in Norway in order to spend more private time there. King Oscar II himself is said to have been fluent in Norwegian. The second independent Norway =Change of dynasty= The third Bernadotte king was Charles IV of Norway. He did not have any male descendants to inherit his thrones of Sweden and Norway, these thrones were \\"lost\\" to Charles XV's younger brother, Oscar II, instead of his only daughter Lovisa of Sweden, crown princess of Denmark. It has been said that Carl XV promised Lovisa on his deathbed that eventually a son of Lovisa would be entitled to be the heir of the Norwegian throne. Lovisa's son, Prince Carl of Denmark (namesake of his maternal grandfather the King of Norway and Sweden) was the second son of the future King Frederick VIII of Denmark, a younger brother of Denmark's future King Christian X (young Carl personally became a king before his father and his brother), a paternal grandson of king Christian IX of Denmark (during whose reign he was prince of Denmark) and a maternal grandson of King Charles IV of Norway (who was also King of Sweden). He was born in 1872, a few weeks before King Charles died. The future Haakon VII of Norway belonged to the House of Oldenburg, which 1448‚Äì1814 was the Royal House of union of Denmark and Norway, to its branch Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. His family had permanent links with Norway already beginning from late Middle Ages, and also several of his father's ancestors had been kings of independent Norway (such as Haakon V of Norway, Christian I of Norway, Frederick I, Christian III, Frederick II, Christian IV, as well as Frederick III of Norway). Christian Frederick, who was King of Norway briefly in 1814, the first king of the Norwegian 1814 constitution and struggle for independence, was his great-granduncle. In 1905, Carl, taking the name Haakon, ascended the throne of independent Norway to succeed his deposed great-uncle Oscar II. =Full independence= King Haakon VII early during his reign. In 1905 a series of disputes between parliament and the King culminated with the matter of separate Norwegian consuls to foreign countries. Norway had grown into one of the world's leading shipping nations while Sweden retained control of both the diplomatic and consulate corps. The Swedes had little insight in the matters Norwegian ships and businessmen needed assistance with abroad and consulates were not even established in several important shipping cities. The demand for separate Norwegian consuls was seen as very important by the Norwegian parliament and society. The Storting proposed a law establishing a separate Norwegian consulate corps. King Oscar II refused to ratify the law and subsequently the Norwegian cabinet resigned. The king was not able to form any other government that had the support of parliament and as such it was deemed on 7 June that he had failed to function as King of Norway.Royal House web page on the dissolution of the union Retrieved 21 November 2006 The Norwegian people gave their consent in a plebiscite held on 13 August which resulted in an overwhelming 368,208 votes (99.95%) in favor of dissolution of the Union, against 184 (0.05%) opposed, with 85 percent of Norwegian men voting. No women voted, as universal suffrage was not granted until 1913, however Norwegian feminists collected more than 200,000 signatures in favor of dissolution. On 12 November and 13 November, in the second constitutional plebiscite in three months, Norwegian voters decided by a nearly 79 percent majority (259,563 to 69,264) to keep the monarchy instead of establishing a republic. During the summer a Norwegian delegation had already approached the 33-year-old Prince Carl of Denmark, the second son of the Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark. The Norwegian parliament had considered other candidates but ultimately chose Prince Carl, partly because he already had a son to continue the line of succession, but more significantly because Carl was married to Maud of Wales, the daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. By bringing in a king with British royal ties, it was hoped that Norway could court Britain's support. Prince Carl impressed the delegation in many ways, not the least because of his sensitivity to the liberal and democratic movements that had led to Norway's independence. Though the Norwegian constitution stipulated that the Storting could choose a new king if the throne were vacant, Carl was aware that many Norwegians  including leading politicians and high-ranking military officers  favored a republican form of government. Attempts to persuade the prince to accept the throne on the basis of election at Parliament failed; Carl insisted that he would accept the crown only if the Norwegian people expressed their will for monarchy by referendum and if the parliament then elected him king. Following the November plebiscite affirming Norwegians' desire for a monarchy, the parliament by an overwhelming majority offered Carl a clear mandate to the Norwegian throne on 18 November. The prince accepted the same evening, choosing the name Haakon, a traditional name used by Norwegian kings. The last king with that name had been Haakon VI, who died in the year 1380. The new king therefore became Haakon VII, King of Norway. His two-year-old son Alexander, the heir apparent, was renamed Olav and became Crown Prince Olav. The new royal family arrived in the capital Kristiania (later Oslo) on 25 November. Haakon VII was sworn in as king of Norway on 27 November. =A new monarchy= The early years of the new Norwegian monarchy were marked by a shortage of funds. The Norwegian state was poor and funds were needed elsewhere than in the upkeep of a large court. In that sense it was a stroke of good fortune that Prince Carl had set as a condition for accepting the throne that he would not be forced to keep a large court. However the royal travels and the upkeep of the royal residences, after the initial refurbishment in 1905, were to some extent neglected. One example of the negative financial situation is that Prince Carl had been promised a Royal Yacht when he accepted the throne, but this was not fulfilled until 1947.RNoN web page on the HNoMY Norge (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 One important incident in the early years of the new monarchy was in 1928 when the King appointed the first Labour government. The Norwegian Labour Party was at that time quite radical and even had the abolition of monarchy as part of their programme. It was the custom for the King to rely on the advice of previous Prime Minister in deciding whom to give the assignment as new Prime Minister. In this case the previous conservative Prime Minister was opposed to giving power to the radicals and advised the appointment of someone else. But the King adhered to the established practice of parliamentarism and decided to appoint Christopher Hornsrud the first Labour Prime Minister. The Labour party later dropped the abolition of monarchy from their programme. During the German occupation of World War II the King was an important symbol of national unity and resistance. His steadfast opposition to the German demands of surrender was important for the fighting spirit of the Norwegian population. The constitutional powers granted to the King in the Norwegian monarchical system made his position very important and enabled the government in exile to continue its work with the utmost legitimacy. After the war the Norwegian royal house succeeded in maintaining a balance between regality and approachability. King Olav V was deemed the people's king and the spontaneous show of mourning from the population upon his death in 1991 demonstrated the high standing he had among the Norwegian people. Even republicans were among the masses lighting candles in front of the Palace.VG article on Socialist Left party leader's critique of the palace refurbishment where the republican admits to revering King Olav (Norwegian) Retrieved 21 November 2006 In later years the marriages of the then Crown Prince Harald in 1968 and of Crown Prince Haakon in 2001 sparked considerable controversy, but the lasting effect on the popularity of the monarchy has been minimal. Although decreased from its level of above 90 percent after the war, support for the monarchy seems to remain stable around and mostly above the 70 percent mark.Aftenposten article on the Popularity of the Monarchy Retrieved 21 November 2006 Heir of Norway Use of the title \\"Heir of Norway\\" (Arving til Norge) established in the 17th century. Firstly, several junior agnatic members of the House of Oldenburg (the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp among the first ones), themselves usually titular Dukes in Schleswig-Holstein, assumed the title to constant use, as one of their main titles. There are plenty of examples from official dispatches and notices of the 17th, 18th and 19th century of several princely persons titled \\"Duke of Holstein, Heir of Norway\\". This is why it has been used as part of their titles by the emperors of Russia until 1917 since their agnatic line traces back to Peter III of Russia, first Russian ruler of the House of Oldenburg. From the 15th century, at least up to 1660, the heir apparent of the King of Denmark and Norway was generally titled \\"Prince of Norway\\", in recognition to his hereditary right to succeed to the Norwegian throne upon the death of the king, as opposed to the need to pass an election in order to succeed to the Danish throne. Other members of House of Oldenburg, including any younger siblings of the Prince of Norway, were not called princes or princesses of Norway, but the title \\"Heir of Norway\\" was sooner or later accorded to them. Next, the heads of the line descending from Haakon V of Norway's illegitimate, but succession-entitlement-recognized daughter Agnes Haakonardottir, started also to use the same title \\"Heir of Norway\\". They got support from monarchs of the Swedish Empire to their pretension, being interested in challenging the Danish grip to Norway. Their forefathers (or predecessors in claim line) had in the 14th and 15th centuries launched their ambitions towards Norwegian throne even as revolts - see Sudreim claim.

Born Arthur Asahel Shurtleff, he changed his last name in 1930 in order, he said, to conform to the \\"ancient spelling of the family name\\". After over 30 years of success as a practicing landscape architect and town planner, in 1928 he was called upon by John D. Rockefeller Jr., and the Boston architectural firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn to serve as Chief Landscape Architect for the restoration and recreation of the gardens, landscape, and town planning of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, a position he held until his retirement in 1941. It was the largest and most important commission of his career. Shurcliff was born in Boston, Massachusetts, studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1889‚Äì1894), and upon the advice of Charles Eliot and Frederick Law Olmsted, enrolled at Harvard University for studies in art history, surveying, horticulture and design. After his graduation in 1896, he joined Olmsted's Brookline landscape architecture firm. In 1899, he aided Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. in founding America's first four- year landscape architecture school at Harvard University. He set up his own Boston practice in 1904. The following year, 1905, he married Margaret Homer Nichols, with whom he had six children. An early member of the American Society of Landscape Architects he later served two terms as its president(1928‚Äì1932). In addition to the gardens, landscapes, and town planning of Colonial Williamsburg, his better known public works include the laying out of Old Sturbridge Village, the Charles River Esplanade, the redesign of Frederick Law Olmsted's Back Bay Fens and the zoological park at Franklin Park, all three in Boston. He served as a consultant to the Boston Parks Department, the Metropolitan District Commission and the Metropolitan Planning Board. More Boston works include the Paul Revere Mall (also called The Prado) in the North End, and the John Harvard Mall in Charlestown, both located along the Freedom Trail. Among numerous private commissions are included Carter's Grove and Wilton House Museum in Virginia, Greatwood Gardens at Goddard College, Plainfield, Vermont; the Wells brothers' estates at Sturbridge, Massachusetts (creators and funders of Old Sturbridge Village); the Brookview-Irvington Park, Lafayette Place, and Wildwood Park communities in Fort Wayne, Indiana; and the Richard Crane estate at Ipswich, Massachusetts.

Seitz is best known for leading The Fabulous Freebirds under the ring name Michael \\"P.S.\\" (\\"Purely Sexy\\") Hayes and for his role as an announcer under the name Dok Hendrix in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He is currently signed to WWE as one of the senior producers. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1977‚Äì1982)= Hayes started wrestling in 1977 in the Tennessee regional promotions. In 1978, he wrestled his first tour overseas in Germany for Catch Wrestling Association. In 1979, wrestling for Mid South Wrestling at the suggestion of Bill Watts he formed a tag team with Terry \\"Bam Bam\\" Gordy winning the Mid South Tag Team Championship 3 times and became the wrestling faction called The Fabulous Freebirds. Hayes became Michael \\"P.S.\\" Hayes, and they strutted their way to many tag team titles along with Buddy \\"Jack\\" Roberts. Hayes also started moonwalking in the ring like Michael Jackson used to do in concert. The Freebirds spent 1980 through 1982 in the NWA's Georgia Championship Wrestling area, where they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship a few times, split and feuded, then mended fences. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1982‚Äì1986)= In 1982, they left for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), where they had one of their most famous feuds. Hayes was chosen by the fans to be the special guest referee during the Ric Flair-Kerry Von Erich NWA World Heavyweight Championship steel cage match at Christmas Star Wars. Hayes at one point knocked Flair out so Von Erich could get the pin and the title. Von Erich refused to pin him after the dirty deed which ultimately led to Gordy slamming the cage door on Von Erich's head. As this later cost him the title, it triggered the legendary feud between The Fabulous Freebirds and The Von Erichs and ended a good respectful friendship between both groups. The Freebird-Von Erich feud ended for good in 1993 during a memorial card in tribute to Kerry Von Erich. Hayes was always the leader of the group with his exceptional mic skills and he recorded the team's new theme song, Badstreet USA, in 1983. The video to the song features all three of The Fabulous Freebirds as well as Jimmy Garvin, who was often considered the fourth Freebird. They had used the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \\"Free Bird\\" and Willie Nelson's version of \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" up to that point and would on occasion in the future. In 1984, The Freebirds had a brief stint in the WWF but left when management wanted to split them up. The Freebirds then spent a few months in the AWA in 1985, feuding with The Road Warriors over the AWA World Tag Team Championship, winning the belts temporarily at the inaugural SuperClash event before the AWA overturned the decision. The Freebirds interfered in the match where the Warriors lost the belts to Jimmy Garvin and Steve Regal, and subsequently returned to Texas. In 1986, Hayes appeared in the opening credits of Highlander alongside The Fabulous Freebirds, working his Purely Sexy gimmick on the turnbuckle while writhing free of his ring robe. =Universal Wrestling Federation/Jim Crockett Promotions (1986‚Äì1988)= The Freebirds also spent several months in the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1986 and early 1987 with Sunshine as their manager. There they feuded with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) and with \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. In 1986, Hayes' partner in the Freebirds, Terry Gordy, became the first holder of the UWF heavyweight title. After losing the title by default to One Man Gang, the Freebirds engaged in a major heel vs heel feud with Skandor Akbar's Devastation Inc. group. The feud continued even after Akbar double-crossed Gang and helped Big Bubba Rogers win the title from him, and saw the Freebirds form an alliance with their former enemy Williams against Devastation Inc. After the breakup of the Freebirds, Hayes became a full- fledged babyface and remained in the UWF, which was later sold to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) on April 9, 1987. At the JCP/UWF co-promoted pay-per-view event Starrcade '87, Hayes teamed with Jimmy Garvin (also now a babyface after reconciling with kayfabe brother Ron Garvin) and Sting to face the team of Eddie Gilbert, Rick Steiner and Larry Zbyszko whom they wrestled to a time- limit draw. He later challenged NWA World Champion Ric Flair and frequently teamed with Jimmy Garvin. =Return to WCCW (1988)= Hayes returned to World Class Championship Wrestling to find that his former Freebird partners Gordy and Roberts, in alliance with Iceman Parsons and The Angel of Death, had resumed their feud with the Von Erichs. After Gordy and Roberts helped Parsons win the World Class heavyweight title from Kerry Von Erich by bashing Kerry with socks loaded with weights while the arena lights were mysteriously turned off, a disgusted Hayes allied himself with the Von Erichs against his former Freebird 'brothers'. At the 1988 Parade of Champions, Gordy defeated Hayes in a hair vs hair \\"triple dome of terror\\" (three vertically stacked cages) match. After the match, however, Gordy refused to cut Hayes' hair and instead turned babyface on Roberts and cut his hair. Subsequently, Hayes and Gordy reunited as babyfaces and feuded with Roberts and his Samoan Swat Team as well as old Freebird enemies Devastation Inc, of whom Parsons was now a member. While all this was going on, Hayes continued with his music career, often playing concerts with his Badstreet Band at the Dallas Sportatorium, World Class's main arena. Inevitably, the music career overlapped with World Class' storylines when, at one such concert, Roberts appeared onstage and hit Hayes over the head with a guitar. Hayes also formed a new tag team with \\"Do It To It\\" Steve Cox and together they twice briefly beat the Samoan Swat Team for the World Class tag team titles, on September 12‚Äì16, 1988 and October 15‚Äì17, 1988. =World Championship Wrestling (1989‚Äì1994)= In 1989, Hayes went to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) (formerly JCP) where he wrestled as a face. He turned on U.S. Champ Lex Luger during a match with Hiro Matsuda's \\"Yamazaki Corporation\\" and joined them. The stable included Ric Flair, Barry and Kendall Windham, and Butch Reed. Hayes feuded with Luger and won the U.S. Title from him after Terry Gordy surprised everybody and interfered in the match. Luger later regained the title from Hayes and The Freebirds entered the tournament to crown new NWA World tag team champions. At Clash of the Champions VII, on June 14, 1989, Jimmy Garvin showed up as the newest Freebird and he and Hayes won the tournament and titles (thus reuniting their old tag team from JCP circa 1987). The new champions immediately feuded with The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). Gordy left in late 1989 and Hayes and Garvin feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson). In 1991, The Freebirds feuded with \\"The Young Pistols\\" (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers). They soon added another Freebird, the masked Badstreet. He helped them win the U.S. Tag Team Titles and they all won the Six-Man Titles. They also had two managers briefly, Big Daddy Dink and Diamond Dallas Page. Once Badstreet departed from the group in late 1991, The Freebirds were left with no real direction. The Freebirds turned face, and Garvin's wife Precious became their on-screen manager. Although they won the U.S. Tag Titles again, The Freebirds disbanded by late 1992. Hayes then turned heel again and started managing Arn Anderson and Bobby Eaton, who were still members of the Dangerous Alliance. He became a member of sorts and even helped Paul E. Dangerously in his feud with Madusa. In 1993, Hayes became a fan favorite again and feuded with Paul Orndorff over the TV Title and then briefly teamed (and later feuded) with Johnny B. Badd and also did some commentating before quitting WCW in January 1994, after being offered a $75,000 a year contract (Hayes would make one final appearance in WCW at SuperBrawl IV in February). =Return to Dallas (1994‚Äì1995)= He went back to Dallas to the Global Wrestling Federation and reunited with Garvin and Gordy as The Freebirds, whom he managed them to win their Tag Team Championship, before the company folded that September. After the GWF folded, Hayes remained in Dallas for the National Wrestling Alliance's stay in Dallas, which lasted until April 1995. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1995-present)= Dok Hendrix (1995‚Äì1999) Michael Hayes received a tryout match with the WWF on February 21, 1995 at a WWF Superstars taping in Augusta, Georgia. Wrestling in a dark match, Hayes competed as a face and defeated Ken Raper.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm However he retired from active competition due to a serious back injury he suffered while in WCW and after the NWA's Dallas promotion ended, and debuted on April 14 instead as Dok Hendrix, WWF Action Zone co-host with Todd Pettengill. As Dok Hendrix, he interviewed wrestlers before their matches and initially acted more like a heel, though that was later dropped. His most famous interviews include \\"The birth of Austin 3:16,\\" \\"The Super Soaker DX\\" commercials, and hosting most of WWF's products. Hayes also worked as a color commentator in 1995 with Vince McMahon on WWF Superstars and on the In Your House 1 and the 1995 King of the Ring pay-per-view events. Managing The Hardy Boyz (1999) Hayes returned to active competition in 1999 for Power Pro Wrestling, where he won the promotion's title. He soon came back to WWF TV as the manager for The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy). The Hardy Boyz lost the Tag Team Titles to The Acolytes at Fully Loaded when Hayes was pinned in a handicap match; he was fired by them in August. Backstage roles (1999‚Äìpresent) He then became a backstage road agent (producer) and color commentator for the WWF. Initially appearing for one night on the September 23, 1999 broadcast of SmackDown!, Hayes became a color commentator on Sunday Night Heat alongside Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly from 2000 to 2001, although he was mostly used on the international broadcasts of that show. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, he competed in the gimmick Battle Royal, but was eliminated by the One Man Gang. During the December 5, 2005 episode of RAW, he became involved in verbal sparring with Edge in which Hayes attacked Edge's lack of main event experience and the details of his love life (with regard to Matt Hardy and Lita). Hayes was later attacked by Edge. In October 2006, Hayes became the head creative writer for the SmackDown brand after Alex Greenfield's departure from the company. He can be seen on the second season of WWE Classics on Demand series Legends of Wrestling. Hayes made occasional appearances on WWE programmes: on the December 7, 2007 episode of SmackDown, Hayes was a guest of MVP's VIP Lounge. Hayes promoted the new Triumph and Tragedy of WCCW DVD and reinforced its anti-drug message. However, Hayes ended up being attacked by MVP before being saved by Rey Mysterio, Jr. On June 28, 2010 episode of Raw, Hayes was one of several Legends who accompanied Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, who was out to promote his new DVD. Hayes and the other legends were later attacked by the NXT season 1 graduates, collectively known as The Nexus. On the May 12, 2011 episode of WWE Superstars, Hayes accompanied Tyson Kidd to the ring but turned on him a week later after Kidd lost his match to Yoshi Tatsu. Hayes hit Kidd, stating he had better things to do than hang around losers. In October 2013, Hayes took a leave of absence from WWE for personal reasons, but he returned to work on December 2, 2013. On August 1, 2014 Hayes appeared in a short segment on the online series JBL and Cole Show in which he stared at a \\"Free Birds, call to enquire\\" flier. In February 2015, Hayes partook in a WWE.com interview alongside Arn Anderson with Michael Cole to discuss Triple H and Sting's match at WrestleMania 31. On April 2, 2016, Hayes was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame with the Fabulous Freebirds. Hayes accepted the award alongside Jimmy Garvin. Music career In 1987, on the back of the popularity of the \\"Badstreet USA\\" theme, Hayes recorded and released an album, Off The Streets. He also performed live concerts to promote the album with his backing band, the Badstreet Band. The July 1988 issue of Pro Wrestling Illustrated (written circa March 1988) contained a (possibly kayfabed) column by writer Dave Rosenbaum in which he visited the box office for a Badstreet Band show and surveyed what sort of people would actually go to Hayes' concerts. In 1992, Hayes performed a duet with music producer Darwin Conort called \\"Freebird Forever\\" on the WCW album, Slam Jam 1.WCW Slam Jam - 05. Fabulous Freebirds - Freebird Forever, YouTube In 2011, Hayes paid tribute to his Freebird brother Terry Gordy, who died of a heart attack caused by a blood clot in 2001, with a song entitled \\"Freebird Road\\" produced w/Darwin Conort, based on Johnny VanZant's \\"Brickyard Road\\" (with permission) His music video was an emotional and stirring trip down memory lane as a Freebird and shows shots of him at Gordy's grave.Freebird Road, Michael PS Hayes YouTube Channel Championships and accomplishmentsCauliflower Alley Club Lou Thesz Award (2014) *Georgia Championship Wrestling NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy NWA National Tag Team Championship (4 times) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy (3) and Otis Sistrunk (1) NWA United National Championship (1 time) *Mid-South Wrestling Association Mid-South Tag Team Championship (2 time) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy *NWA Mid-America NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy *Power Pro Wrestling PPW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame Class of 2015 as a member of The Fabulous Freebirds *Pro Wrestling Illustrated PWI Tag Team of the Year award in 1981 ‚Äì with Terry Gordy PWI ranked him #56 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 1992 PWI ranked him #71 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the \\"PWI Years\\" in 2003 PWI ranked him #3 of the top 100 tag teams of the \\"PWI Years\\" with Terry Gordy in 2003 *World Championship Wrestling NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (1 time) NWA (Mid-Atlantic)/WCW World Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Jimmy Garvin WCW United States Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Jimmy Garvin WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Jimmy Garvin and Badstreet *World Class Championship Wrestling / World Class Wrestling Association NWA American Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy NWA (Texas)/WCWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (7 times) ‚Äì with Terry Gordy & Buddy Roberts (6 times) and Kerry Von Erich & Kevin Von Erich (1) WCWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Steve Cox * WWE  WWE Hall of Fame (Class of 2016) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter Most Charismatic (1981) Best Three-Man Team (1984) with Terry Gordy & Buddy Roberts Best Heel (1983,1986) Feud of the Year (1983, 1984) with Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy vs. the Von Erichs Match of the Year (1984) with Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy vs. the Von Erichs (Kerry, Kevin, and Mike) in an Anything Goes match on July 4 Best Color Commentator (1986) Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 2005) ‚Äì as part of The Fabulous Freebirds Discography =Single=Badstreet USA Grand Theft Records 1984 =Album=Off The Streets ‚Äì Grand Theft Records 1987 Track list: #

Until January 1, 2002, it served all Egged intercity bus routes originating and terminating in Haifa, as well as most local routes. The Bat Galim station was in use for about thirty years. The bus platforms at the Bat Galim central bus station were outdoors. The building also housed outdoor stores and restaurants. On the lower level, one side of the building was used for departures, and the other for arrivals. On the upper level, buses arrived on the side of the building used for departures below. There is a tower above the station. A pedestrian tunnel connects the Bat Galim railway station, the Bat Galim bus station and the eastbound bus stops on the opposite side of HaHagana Road. Replacement On January 1, 2002, the new HaMifratz central bus station opened. At that time, all buses coming from the North and the Galilee began to terminate at the new station, and new more frequent lines operated between the two stations. In late 2003, the Hof HaCarmel central bus station opened, replacing the Bat Galim central bus station as the main bus station in Haifa. All bus lines coming from the South now terminate there, and the Bat Galim station has become just a stop between the two other stations. Free transfers are available inside Haifa for passengers using Egged's intercity bus lines. All three stations connect to local lines within the city of Haifa as well. Continued use after replacement The Bat Galim bus station is now only used to store Egged buses, and the tower is used by Egged as office space. Intra- city buses now stop on the road, rather than inside the station, on the route between the Hof HaCarmel central bus station and the HaMifratz central bus station. Several buses have their terminus at new platforms outside the station. All of the original platforms are now closed, as are most stores and restaurants.

The railroad was hit hard when the local Rubbermaid plant in Centerville (APNC's premier customer) closed its doors on September 15, 2006. At least 75% of the cargo hauled by the shortline was from Rubbermaid. The railroad was partly operated by the county.

It was first published in Japan on January 26, 1990, then released later in North America on February 2, 1990, and finally in Europe on September 28, 1990. Plot \\"The year is 2159. The Earth Federal Government was established, linking the people with a common government against other species. As part of this new addition and to defend the human race's peace and safety, the Earth Federal Army was also created.\\" \\"The army went on the offensive, and attacked a star known as 'Turin.' However, the Earth Federal Army was no match for the overwhelming combat power of Turin, and Earth's fate seemed sealed. As Earth's last chance, a top-secret mobile unit developed a very advanced space fighter in Earth's last fortification. Flying with the mothership, 'Mother Atena', it arrived at Turin's solar system as the last chance for a violent and final attack on the Turin forces. This advanced spacecraft, and Earth's last hope for survival, is code-named 'Solar Striker'.\\" Gameplay The Solar Striker shooting the first boss. The player controls the advanced space fighter, code- named Solar Striker. There are six levels of play against enemies known as the forces of Reticulon. These enemies appear from the top of the screen. The player can amass power-ups by shooting special ships. One power-up doubles the player's firepower, three power-ups triples the player's firepower, and five power-ups causes shots to explode on impact with enemies, greatly aiding combat against tough enemies and bosses that take many hits to destroy. There are a variety of enemies as well as sub-bosses in later levels. When the player completes all six levels for the first time and after the credits roll, the player will be able to play Hard Mode by pressing Select instead of Start from the title screen. Development Solar Striker was designed by Gunpei Yokoi and Keisuke Terasaki, and developed by Nintendo in co-operation with the external company Minakuchi Engineering. It was first published in Japan on January 26, 1990, then released later in North America in February, and finally in Europe on September 28. As such, it is one of the few scrolling shooters developed by Nintendo. Reception Solar Striker has been met with generally favorable reviews. It earned an overall score of 75% at GameRankings. Mean Machines described Solar Striker as \\"adequate\\", but noted there was a lack of material to keep players interested, giving the game a score of 69%. Allgame rated it 2.5/5, describing it as a \\"decent shooter but nothing great\\", and citing its difficulty as a deterrent to enjoying it. Games Are Fun gave it a 7 out of 10. German magazine Power Play praised the title for its variety in terms of enemies and levels, though noted the underlying simplicity of the game as well, giving it a score of 70%. Author Jeff Rovin in the book How to Win at Game Boy Games described the title as \\"one of the oldest kinds of Nintendo games\\", comparing it to SNK's Alpha Mission but added there were too few instances of innovation or surprises, and the powerups were \\"unsatisfying\\". Legacy The background music for Level 1 and Level 2 was used in the beginning of the Captain N: The Game Master episode, \\"The Trouble With Tetris\\", in a slightly altered form. A space craft seen in the same part of the episode resembles the Solar Striker on the Japanese box art of the game. The Level 1 background music was also used in later season 2 episodes of Captain N: The Game Master.

The film presents a satirical view of the McCarthy communist-hunt era and certain other aspects of United States politics and society. The film, which was produced in Europe after Chaplin's exile from the U.S. in 1952, did not open in the United States until 1972. For this reason, the movie was presented on the island of Ischia, in Italy. Plot \\"One of the minor annoyances in modern life is a revolution.\\" Deposed by revolution in his home country of Estrovia, King Igor Shahdov (Charlie Chaplin) comes to New York City almost broke, his securities having been stolen by his own Prime Minister. He tries to contact the Atomic Energy Commission with his ideas for using atomic power to create a utopia. At a dinner party, some of which is televised live (unbeknown to him), Shahdov reveals he has had some experience in the theatre. He's approached to do TV commercials but does not like the idea. Later, he does make a few commercials in order to get some money. Invited to speak at a progressive school, Shahdov meets Rupert Macabee (Michael Chaplin), a ten-year-old historian and editor of the school paper who doesn't want to disclose his political affinity due to fear of McCarthyism. Macabee proceeds to give Shahdov a stern Marxist lecture. Although Rupert himself says he distrusts all forms of government, his parents are Communists who are jailed for not giving up names at a Joseph McCarthy-type hearing. Because young Rupert had spent time with him, Shahdov is suspected of being a Communist himself, and has to face one of the hearings. He is cleared of all charges, but not before a scene in which Shahdov accidentally directs a strong stream of water from a fire hose at the members of the \\"House Committee on Un- American Activities\\" (HUAC), who scatter in panic. He decides to join his estranged queen in Paris for a reconciliation. In the meantime, the authorities force the child to reveal the names of his parents' friends in exchange for his parents' freedom. Grieving and guilt-ridden, Rupert is presented to King Shahdov as a \\"patriot\\". Shahdov reassures him that the anti- Communist scare is a lot of nonsense which will be over soon and invites him to come to Europe with his parents for a visit. In addition to its condemnation of HUAC's methods, the film takes witty potshots at American commercialism, popular music, celebrity culture, and film. A dinner party scene includes a number of satirical portrayals of actors and public figures of the period, including Sophie Tucker. Cast Charlie Chaplin as King Shahdov * Maxine Audley as Queen Irene * Jerry Desmonde as Prime Minister Voudel * Oliver Johnston as Ambassador Jaume * Dawn Addams as Ann Kay - TV Specialist * Sid James as Johnson - TV Advertiser (billed as Sidney James) * Joan Ingram as Mona Cromwell - Hostess * Michael Chaplin as Rupert Macabee * John McLaren as Macabee Senior * Phil Brown as Headmaster * Harry Green as Lawyer * Robert Arden as Liftboy * Alan Gifford as School Superintendent * Robert Cawdron as U.S. Marshal * George Woodbridge as Member of Atomic Commission Reception The film did well in Europe, but its lack of U.S. distribution severely hampered its commercial impact. The film divides opinion over its merits. Variety called it a \\"tepid disappointment\\" and a \\"half- hearted comedy with sour political undertones\\" with some \\"spasmodically funny scenes\\". The film has a \\"fresh\\" rating of 80% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2003, believes A King in New York to be an important film within Chaplin's body of work. He concludes his lengthy examination of the film with the statement, \\"Although A King in New York targets the social and political climate of the 1950s, its satiric commentary is timeless. Despite its flaws, the film remains a fascinating study of life in America through the eyes of its most famous exile\\".Vance, Jeffrey. Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema (2003): Harry N. Abrams, p. 329. The film was eventually released in the United States in March 1972, opening at the Little Art theatre in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It was then shown at UCLA in November 1973 and then opened at the Playboy theatre in New York on December 19, 1973.

Introduction Historical photo of DƒÅr-ul-Funun Founded by Amir Kabir, then the royal vizier to Nasereddin Shah, the Shah of Persia, DƒÅr al-Funun originally was conceived as a polytechnic to train upper-class Persian youth in medicine, engineering, military science, and geology. It was similar in scope and purpose to American land grant colleges like Purdue and Texas A&M.; Like them, it developed and expanded its mission over the next hundred years, eventually becoming the University of Tehran.For an illustrated report on Dar ol-Fonoun see: Hamid-Reza Hosseini, Dar ol-Fonoun in want of love (\\"Dar ol- Fonoun dar hasrat-e eshgh\\"), in Persian, Jadid Online, September 22, 2008, . The pertinent photographs (15 in total) can be viewed here: . DƒÅr ul-Funun Courtyard The institute was planned by the Iranian educated MirzƒÅ RezƒÅ Mohandes (fa), and built by the architect Mohammad-Taqi KhƒÅn MemƒÅr-BƒÅshi (fa) under the supervision of the Qajar prince BahrƒÅm MirzƒÅ. Facilities such as an assembly hall, a theater, library, cafeteria, and a publishing house were built for the institute. In 1930, the building was destroyed by MirzƒÅ YahyƒÅ Khan QarƒÅgozlu (also known as EtemƒÅd od-Dowleh), then Minister of Education, and rebuilt based on a Russian engineering design. Many parts of the institute were later on absorbed and merged into the newly establishing Tehran University. The Faculty of Medicine for example, was particularly the successor to the DƒÅr ul-Funun Department of Medicine, established in 1851, which had become the School of Medicine (Madreseh-ye Tebb) in 1919.Encyclop√¶dia Iranica: http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/faculties-v The elite school was training 287 students by 1889, and had graduated 1100 students by 1891. During this time, the faculty consisted of 16 European, and 26 Iranian professors. Participants in the Ferdowsi Millennial Congress, at the entrance to the DƒÅr al-Funun auditorium, Tehran Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration was held in DƒÅr al-Funun in 1934.

Born in LaFayette, Alabama, she relocated to New Orleans in 1939, where she lived and worked until her death in 1980.Pictured in my Mind Sister Morgan achieved critical acclaim during her lifetime for her folk art paintings. Her work has been included in many groundbreaking exhibitions of visionary and folk art from the 1970s onwards.  Early life  Sister Morgan was born Gertrude Williams in Lafayette, Alabama, to mother Frances \\"Fannie\\" Williams and father Edward Williams. She was the seventh child of a poor rural family. For reasons unknown, Sister Morgan left school before completing the third grade. Around 1917 her family moved to Columbus, Georgia, where she worked as a servant and nursemaid in a private home. Marriage Gertrude Williams married Will Morgan on February 12, 1928. She lived with her husband at 1324 North Avenue in Columbus, GA. While there is no evidence of a divorce, it is known that Sister Morgan left Columbus alone in 1938, traveling first to Alabama and then to New Orleans, where she would settle. Call to religion =Early involvement in the church= Sister Morgan's first documented involvement with religion came in her late teens, when she joined the Rose Hill Memorial Baptist Church, a local congregation in Columbus, Georgia. After she began painting in 1956, Sister Morgan documented this time in her life in the paintings THE ROSE HILL MEMORiAL BAPTiST CHURCH, Columbus Ga. (n.d.) and Rose Hill Memorial Baptist Church (n.d.). These paintings narrate the shifts in the Rose Hill church leadership, after the death of Reverend Miller in 1930. =Revelations from God= The first of many revelations that Gertrude was to experience came in 1934. The story of this revelation is inscribed on one of her paintings, 1324 NO AVE COLUMBUS GA. (n.d.). On it she has written, \\"Sitting in my Kitchen one night I heard a great strong Voice speak to me said I'll make thee as a signet for I have chosen thee I got this calling on the 30th day of Dec in 1934 I had to answere to my calling and one day give up and Pack up and go ‚Ä¶ a chosed vessel of God's its wonderful to Be. God called me a chased me and turned me into the hands of his son and JESUS said take up your cross and follow me.\\" In 1938 a second revelation followed, in the form of a voice that said, \\"Go-o-o- o-o, Preacher, tell it to the World\\". It was in this year that she left Columbus, first for Opelika, Alabama, then to Mobile and possibly Montgomery. She worked as a nursemaid and nanny in Opelika and Mobile, and possibly began work as a healer and street prophet during this time. =Orphanage in New Orleans= When she arrived in New Orleans in 1939, Sister Gertrude met Mother Margaret Parker and Sister Cora Williams. The two women were involved in the Holiness and Sanctified movement, an African American faith in which the activities of music, song and dance were central. The three women soon established a mission and orphanage at Mother Parker's house at 533 Flake Avenue in Lower Gentilly, then on the outskirts of New Orleans. The orphanage was funded by money raised from preaching and performing in the streets. The three women adopted black robes, and gave shelter to as many as twenty orphans and runaways at a time. (In Sister Gertrude's paintings, the three women are pictured in their black robes, adorned with white collars, cuffs and waist ties). As Gentilly was a fairly rural area at this time, they raised livestock and grew vegetables on the land surrounding the large house. They held neighborhood feasts at the Orphanage, where the 'Prophetesses' (as Sister Morgan would later name them in her paintings) would play the piano, drums, cymbals and beat tambourines. In addition to street preaching, the three women visited Orleans Parish Prison, providing spiritual guidance for inmates, as well as traveling to other towns in Louisiana and Texas for church camps and meetings. Sister Morgan worked at the orphanage until 1957. = Everlasting Gospel Mission = Doorway of Sister Gertrude's former home/mission in the Lower 9th Ward, 2007. After leaving Gentilly, Sister Morgan roomed in various houses, mostly in the Lower Ninth Ward, an historically African American neighborhood in Orleans Parish. Eventually she settled at 5444 North Dorgenois street in the Lower Ninth, in a single shotgun house with the owner of the property, Jennie Johnson. The lawn of the property was allegedly covered in four leafed clovers, a detail that can be glimpsed in black and white photographs of the property. She named it the \\"Everlasting Gospel Mission\\", and turned the first room of the house into a prayer room where she would give sermons. Her paintings adorned the white walls of the prayer room, which also contained a small desk, a tapping stick, musical instruments and her painted paper megaphones that she would use to preach. Morgan's former house and mission remained a neighborhood landmark after her death. Like the rest of the neighborhood, it was severely damaged in the Federal levee failure flood disaster during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The damaged house was gutted in hopes it could be repaired and renovated, but was subsequently demolished. = Bride of Christ = In 1957 Sister Morgan received another revelation from God. Dreaming, she heard a voice that told her she was the Bride of Christ. She then discarded her black missionary attire in favor of an all-white ensemble made up of a nurses' uniform, peaked nurses' cap and matching white shoes.  Artwork  In 1956, Sister Gertrude Morgan received another revelation from God urging her to paint. She understood the act of painting as a tool to be used in her service to the Lord, just as she used music in her street preaching. Sister Morgan used her early paintings as visual aids in her sermons and teachings, often with children. Her paintings depict religious subject matter almost exclusively, illustrating scenes from scripture. The Book of Revelation was of special significance, and provided subject matter that she would return to over and over again in her work. =Style= Similar to other self-taught artists, Sister Morgan used simple forms to depict the human figure. Her works are characterized by their lack of the use of formal techniques such as perspective and definition of light and shadow, giving them a flat, two dimensional quality. She painted and drew using acrylics, tempera, ballpoint pen, watercolors, crayon, colored and lead pencils and felt tip markers. Using inexpensive materials she had at hand, Sister Morgan painted on paper, toilet rolls, plastic pitchers, paper megaphones, scrap wood, lampshades, paper fans and styrofoam trays. The fact that she was self-taught, coupled with her choice of materials as well as her style and subject matter have led her to be characterized as a naive, folk, visionary, vernacular and outsider artist. =Subject matter= Originally conceiving her artworks as appendages to her gospel teachings, Sister Morgan's paintings are often inscribed with passages from scripture and lyrics to popular gospel songs. Similarly, her paintings that document her childhood, early adulthood and first years in New Orleans are inscribed with the narratives of specific events, that often reference her evangelical activities. Morgan particularly favored the Book of Revelations. William A. Fagaly writes, \\"The apocalyptic text of the Book of Revelation offers a plethora of visionary images: the Apocalypse and its four horsemen, the Antichrist, the Whore of Babylon, the Beast (with the mark 666), the heavenly book of seven seals, Armageddon, the return of the Jews to the Holy Land, the millennial kingdom of Christ on Earth, and the New Jerusalem.\\" It is for her paintings of New Jerusalem that Sister Morgan is most well known. The holy city of New Jerusalem \\"coming down from God out of heaven\\" was consistently depicted as a multi storey apartment building in her compositions. In some of her New Jerusalem paintings, a choir of interracial angels adorn the sky. The choir of angels frequent many of her paintings, sometimes as one of many elements in a composition, and other times as the sole subject. Another recurring image in her work is a self-portrait as the Bride of Christ, riding with Jesus in an airplane. There is speculation that this references the hymn \\"Oh, Jesus Is My Air-o-plane\\", recorded in 1930. Another hymn, \\"Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me\\", first published in 1871 by Edward Hopper, establishes a related Jesus-as-pilot motif. Her later work is characterized by the dominance of the inscriptions. Her imagery becomes sparse and in some compositions non-existent. Sister Morgan signed her paintings with many names, among them Black Angel, Lamb Bride, Nurse to Doctor Jesus, Everlasting Gospel Revelation Preacher, Bride of Christ and Little Ethiopia Girl. =Career= Around 1960, art dealer Larry Borenstein met Sister Morgan while she was preaching in the French Quarter. He invited her to perform and exhibit work in his art gallery after coming upon her shouting on a street corner with a paper megaphone. Borenstein cultivated an audience for her work by introducing her paintings to collectors, artists, museums and galleries. Lee Friedlander and Andy Warhol were both fans of her work. Warhol was an occasional correspondents, while Friedlander used Sister Morgan as a subject in his photographs. In 1970 poet and performer Rod McKuen, a fan and collector of Morgan's work used thirteen of her illustrations to accompany a book of Bible quotations, God's Greatest Hits. It sold more than 300 000 copies. One of the tempera and paint illustrations from God's Greatest Hits is held by the Smithsonian's Evans-Tibbs Collection. = Major exhibitions = In 1970, Sister Morgan's work was shown at the Arts and Science Centre in Baton Rouge, LA.Price, Ann. \\"Character Portrayal Outstanding in Show\\", Morning Advocate, October 7, 1970, 16-A. In 1973 her work was included in the exhibition Louisiana Folk Paintings at the Museum of American Folk Art (now the American Folk Art Museum) in New York. The three-person exhibit displayed over 75 of Sister Morgan's paintings, alongside fellow visionary artists Clementine Hunter and Bruce Brice. It was also in 1973 that the NOMA exhibited Sister Morgan's work for the first time, in a show titled Naive Art in Louisiana. In 1982 the exhibition Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980 featured twenty artists (including Sister Morgan) and close to 400 paintings and sculptures. It opened at the Corcoran Museum of Art and went on to tour the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Saint Louis Art Museum, The Baltimore Museum of Art, the Des Moines Art Center and the Cleveland Museum of Art. In 2004, the first major retrospective of Morgan's work The Tools of Her Ministry: the Art of Sister Gertrude Morgan opened at the Folk Art Museum in New York City. The exhibition was curated by William A. Fagaly, former Director of the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA). This exhibition then traveled to NOMA and later to The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago. The exhibition was accompanied by the publication of a catalogue containing essays by William A. Fagaly, Jason A. Berry and Helen M. Shannon. =End of painting= Sister Morgan's art brought her fame and notoriety, something she reportedly both enjoyed and felt conflicted about. In 1973 she announced that the Lord had ordered her to cease painting in order to concentrate on her preaching and poetry. 'Painting now? Oh no,' she reportedly said in 1974. I'm way too worried. Worrying about what time it is and praying on people's cases.'\\"  Music  Music was another tool of Sister Morgan's ministry. In the early 1970s, Let's Make A Record was recorded in order to capture Morgan singing and playing her tambourine. In 2004 the original album was re-released on the Preservation Hall Recordings label. In 2005, the Ropeadope label released King Britt presents Sister Gertrude Morgan, which took the a cappella/tambourine recordings of Let's Make A Record and added contemporary beat programming and instrumentation. The album received rave reviews and created a new, young audience for Sister Gertrude Morgan. The album artwork featured her paintings.  Works or publications  Morgan, Gertrude. Let's Make a Record.

After the Intifada, Farahat was arrested following the death of senior Hamas militant Imad Aqel. After spending three years in Israeli detention, he returned to Gaza. At the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, in 2000, Farahat officially joined the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades and soon became an active member in the organization, planning and carrying out numerous operations including mortar attacks on Jewish settlements in the Gaza strip. In 2001, Farahat, after several months of work, produced the first prototype for the Qassam rocket and presented it to Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades leaders Salah Shahade and Adnan al-Ghoul. Together with al-Ghoul, Farahat then worked on developing a better version of the Qassam, the \\"Qassam 2\\". Hamas militants used the Qassam 2 extensively after 2002 to attack nearby Israeli settlements and towns. Up to the beginning of 2005, the Qassam rockets were responsible for the death of 6 Israelis, all but one in the Israeli town of Sderot near the Gaza Strip, from which several hundreds of rockets were fired over a period of three years. Farahat also worked as a bombmaker, supplying Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades militants with explosive devices and homemade rocket launchers like the Al-Bana and the Batar. He also worked, under the direction of Salama Hamad, on the conception of a drone that could fly over Israeli towns and cities and bomb them. On 16 February 2003, Farahat was working along with other militants around newly acquired parts of the drone when one of them, booby-trapped, exploded. The device killed Farahat and 5 other militants. The youngest brother of Nidal Farahat, Mohammed, died on 7 March 2002, when he attacked a military academy in the Israeli settlement of Azmona, killing 5 young settlers. Farwad Farahat, another of his brothers, was killed in an IDF airstrike on his car south of Gaza City on his way to launch rockets at Israel in 2005. His three other brothers are alive, with one in prison since 1992 and the two others, Wessam Farahat and Momen Farahat still living in the Gaza Strip where they assume high-ranking functions in the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The latter sustained serious injuries to a hand while fighting against Israeli soldiers during an incursion in Gaza City in 2003. Finally, Nidal's mother, Maryam Farahat, nicknamed Um Nidal, was elected in the Palestinian parliament dominated by Hamas following the 26 January 2006 Palestinian legislative election. 1971 births 2003 deaths Hamas members Palestinian militants People from Gaza City Assassinated Hamas members Muslim inventors ","title":"Nidal Fat'hi Rabah Farahat"},{"id":"1854423","text":"The main melody of Saint-Sa√´ns's fourth piano concerto. Piano Concerto No. 4 in C minor, Op. 44 by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, is the composer's most structurally innovative piano concerto. In one sense it is structured like a four-movement symphony, but these are grouped in pairs. That is, the piece is divided into two parts, each of which combines two main movements (I. A moderate-tempo Theme and Variations in C Minor; II. A slower, related Theme and Variations in Ab Major; III. Scherzo in C Minor; IV. Finale in C Major). However, in each part there is a bridge-like transitional section, between the two main \\"movements\\" ‚Äì for example, a fugal Andante in part II functions as an interlude between the two main triple-meter sections. #Allegro moderato ‚Äì Andante #Allegro vivace ‚Äì Andante ‚Äì Allegro The first movement begins with a gently mischievous chromatic subject, heard in dialogue between the strings and piano soloist, and continues in a creative thematic development similar to Saint-Sa√´ns' third symphony. The composer demonstrates brilliant skill in employing the piano and orchestra almost equally. In the Andante, he introduces a hymn-like theme with the woodwinds (also strikingly similar to the tune of the third symphony's final section), and uses this as a platform on which he builds a series of variations before bringing the movement to a quiet close. The Allegro vivace begins as a playful and cunning scherzo (although still in C minor), deriving its main theme from the original chromatic subject in the beginning of the first movement. There is a bold switch to 6/8 time, and the piano leads the orchestra into a new brief but energetic theme. Eventually the orchestra moves into a lush Andante, recapitulating the chorale-style melody. Rather suddenly, the piano climbs up to a flurry of double octave trills and a climactic trumpet fanfare, leading to the jubilant finale based once more on the hymn theme played at triple time. The concerto concludes with the piano, in cadenza-like cascades, guiding the orchestra to a fortissimo close. The piano concerto was premi√®red on October 31, 1875, at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet of Paris, with the composer as the soloist. The concerto is dedicated to Anton Door, a professor of piano at the Vienna Conservatory. It continues to be one of Saint-Sa√´ns' most popular piano concertos, second only to the Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor.

Cotton described his early works in a 2008 interview, saying \\"My initial impulse to make these paintings really came out of an awareness of the commercial consumer landscape that we live in. Every day we're bombarded with hundreds, if not thousands of messages designed specifically to incite desire within us.\\"Baldwin Gallery (2008). Will Cotton. In 1996, Cotton began to develop an iconography in which the landscape itself became an object of desire. The paintings often feature scenery made up entirely of pastries, candy and melting ice cream. He creates elaborate maquettes of these settings from real baked goods made in his Manhattan studio as a visual source for the final works. Since about 2002, nude or nearly nude pinup-style models have occasionally populated these candy-land scenes. As in the past, the works project a tactile indulgence in fanciful glut.Lindquist, Greg, Will Cotton, artcritical.com, 2008-1-22. Accessed 2012-6-20. The female characters are icons of indulgence and languor, reflecting the feel of the landscape itself. \\"These paintings are all about a very specific place,\\" says Cotton, \\"It's a utopia where all desire is fulfilled all the time, meaning ultimately that there can be no desire, as there is no desire without lack.\\" Influences Chalet, 2003, Oil on linen, 70 x 80\\" Interested in cultural iconography, Cotton's art makes use of the common language of consumer culture shared across geographical boundaries. He considers the visual threads in his work, drawn from imagery ranging from the Candy Land board game and gingerbread houses to pinup art and cotton candy, to be part of the popular culture lexicon. Cotton‚Äôs work also builds upon and updates the idea of land of milk and honey in European literature and art. Cotton states ‚ÄúThe dream of paradise, of a land of plenty, is a thread that runs through all of human history, not just in the affluent times but in fact very often in the lean as well.‚Äù He has also been inspired by painters Frederic Edwin Church, Fran√ßois Boucher and Fragonard, the photographer Carleton Watkins, as well as pin-up painters such as Gil Elvgren. Of his landscape painting influences, Cotton says, > I was initially drawn to the Hudson River School when I learned that many of > the paintings were made specifically to incite a feeling of awe and a desire > to experience the new frontier.

In either case, drawdown is the change in hydraulic head or water level relative to the initial spatial and temporal conditions of the system. Drawdown is often represented in cross-sectional diagrams of aquifers. A record of hydraulic head, or rate of flow (discharge), versus time is more generally called a hydrograph (in both groundwater and surface water). The main contributor to groundwater drawdown since the 1960s is over-exploitation of groundwater resources. Drawdown occurs in response to: # pumping from the bore # interference from a neighbouring pumping bore # in response to local, intensive groundwater pumping # regional seasonal decline due to discharge in excess of recharge  Terminology  Aquifer is an underground layer of permeable rock or sand, that hold or transmit groundwater below the water table that yield a significant supply of water to a well. * Aquifer test (or a pumping test) is a field experiment in which a well is pumped at a controlled rate and the aquifer's response (drawdown) is measured in one or more observation wells. * Cone of depression is a conically-shaped depression that is produced in a water table as a result of pumping water from a well at a given rate. * Groundwater is water located beneath the earth's surface in pores and fractures of soil and rocks. * Hydraulic head (or piezometric head) is a specific measurement of the potential of water above a vertical datum. It is the height of the free surface of water above a given point beneath the surface. * Pumping level is the level of water in the well during pumping. * Specific capacity is the well yield per unit of drawdown. * Static level is the level of water in the well when no water is being removed from the well by pumping. * Water table is the upper level of the zone of saturation, an underground surface in which the soil or rock is permanently saturated with water. * Well yield is the volume of water per unit time that is produced by the well from pumping. Methods for measuring drawdown Transducers are used to measure water levels in groundwater wells, rivers, streams, tanks, open channels and lift stations. *Acoustic well sounders or echometers are a simple, cost effective, and minimally intrusive tool used to measure subsurface pressures and levels. *Electric sounders are a practical land cost- effective method used to measure well water levels. This method uses a weight attached to a stranded insulated wire and an ammeter to indicate a closed circuit. Current supplied from a small battery flows through the circuit when the tip of the wire is in contact with the surface of the water. *Air line method is a convenient and nonintrusive method used to measure water levels that is often used for the repeated testing of wells over 300 feet deep. This method obtains water table depth using a pressure gauge and water displacement. *Wetted tape method is a commonly-used method for measuring water levels up to roughly 90 feet deep. This method uses a lead weight attached to a steel measuring tape.  Ecological impacts of groundwater drawdown  Groundwater drawdown due to excessive water extraction can have adverse ecological impacts. Groundwater environments often have high biodiversity, however, drawdown alters the amount and types of nutrients released to surrounding organisms. In addition, nearby wetlands, fisheries, terrestrial and aquatic habitats may be altered with a reduction in the water available to these ecosystems, sometimes altering species ecophysiology.Antunes C, Chozas S, West J, et al. Groundwater drawdown drives ecophysiological adjustments of woody vegetation in a semi‚Äêarid coastal ecosystem. GlobChange Biol. 2018;24:4894‚Äì4908. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14403 Extracting groundwater at a rate that is faster than it can be naturally replenished is often referred to as overdrafting. Overdrafting may decrease the amount of groundwater that naturally feeds surrounding water bodies, including wetlands, lakes, rivers and streams.‚ÄúEnvironmental Impacts of Water Withdrawals and Discharges in Six Great Lakes Communities: A Role for Green Infrastructure‚Äù, J. W. Ridgway, R. Higuchi, L. Hoffman, and R. Pettit, Environmental Consulting & Technology Inc. Report, 45 pp, May 2016 Additionally, when a cone of depression is formed around a pumping well due to groundwater extraction, nearby groundwater sources may flow toward the well to replenish the cone, taking water from local streams and lakes. This may result in poor water quality in these local water bodies as baseflow water contribution is reduced, which could result in perennial streams becoming more intermittent, and intermittent streams becoming more ephemeral. Finally, drawdown from groundwater extraction may lead to an increased sensitivity of the ecosystem to climate change and may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise and land subsidence.

Only get updated when higher DD is seen. if (DD[i] > MDD) then MDD = DD[i] end if end for Trading definitions There are two main definitions of a drawdown: =1. How low it goes (the magnitude)= :Putting it plainly, a drawdown is the ‚Äúpain‚Äù period experienced by an investor between a peak (new highs) and subsequent valley (a low point before moving higher). :Next, the Maximum Drawdown, or more commonly referred to as Max DD. This is pretty much self explanatory, as the Max DD is the worst (the maximum) peak to valley loss since the investment‚Äôs inception. In finance, the use of the maximum drawdown as an indicator of risk is particularly popular in the world of commodity trading advisors through the widespread use of three performance measures: the Calmar ratio, the Sterling ratio and the Burke ratio. These measures can be considered as a modification of the Sharpe ratio in the sense that the numerator is always the excess of mean returns over the risk-free rate while the standard deviation of returns in the denominator is replaced by some function of the drawdown. =2. How long it lasts (the duration)= :The drawdown duration is the length of any peak to peak period, or the time between new equity highs. :The max drawdown duration is the worst (the maximum/longest) amount of time an investment has seen between peaks (equity highs). Many assume Max DD Duration is the length of time between new highs during which the Max DD (magnitude) occurred. But that isn‚Äôt always the case. The Max DD duration is the longest time between peaks, period. So it could be the time when the program also had its biggest peak to valley loss (and usually is, because the program needs a long time to recover from the largest loss), but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. When X is Brownian motion with drift, the expected behavior of the MDD as a function of time is known. If X is represented as:X(t)=\\\\mu t+ \\\\sigma W(t)Where W(t) is a standard Wiener process, then there are three possible outcomes based on the behavior of the drift \\\\mu: * \\\\mu > 0 implies that the MDD grows logarithmically with time * \\\\mu = 0 implies that the MDD grows as the square root of time * \\\\mu < 0 implies that the MDD grows linearly with time Banking or other finance definitions =Credit offered= Where an amount of credit is offered, a drawdown against the line of credit results in a debt (which may have associated interest terms if the debt is not cleared according to an agreement.) =Funds offered= Where funds are made available, such as for a specific purpose, drawdowns occur if the funds ‚Äì or a portion of the funds ‚Äì are released when conditions are met.  Optimization of drawdown  A passing glance at the mathematical definition of drawdown suggests significant difficulty in using an optimization framework to minimize the quantity, subject to other constraints; this is due to the non-convex nature of the problem. However, there is a way to turn the drawdown minimization problem into a linear program. The authors start by proposing an auxiliary function \\\\Delta_{\\\\alpha}(x), where x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{p} is a vector of portfolio returns, that is defined by:\\\\Delta_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\min_\\\\zeta \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\zeta + {1\\\\over{(1-\\\\alpha)T}}\\\\int_0^T [D(x,t) - \\\\zeta]_{+} \\\\, dt \\\\right\\\\\\\\}They call this the conditional drawdown-at-risk (CDaR); this is a nod to conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which may also be optimized using linear programming. There are two limiting cases to be aware of: * \\\\lim_{\\\\alpha\\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\Delta_\\\\alpha(x) is the average drawdown * \\\\lim_{\\\\alpha\\\\rightarrow 1} \\\\Delta_\\\\alpha(x) is the maximum drawdown See alsoLinear programming *Risk measure *Risk return ratio  References  Further readingBurghardt, G., Duncan, R. and L.

The fruit is highly aromatic, small, symmetrical and dark brown, with a rounded apex and a broad peduncular cavity. In Europe, it is mostly grown in Catalonia, Spain, but it is also grown in Aragon and Andalusia, as well as California, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Azerbaijan. It has recently become one of the dominant olive cultivars in the world, largely under highly intensive, \\"super high-density\\" plantation.

Its relatively small cup, allows it to be cultivated under more intense, high-density conditions than other plantation olives The variety is very productive and enters early into production (from the first half of November). The fruit does not ripen simultaneously, and has an average resistance to detachment. Unlike most varieties, Arbequina has a high germination percentage, making it a common seedling tree for use as a rootstock. 78% of olive oil acres in California are planted on Arbequina rootstock. Gastronomy Although sold as a table olive as well, Arbequina olives have one of the highest concentrations of oil, and are therefore mostly used for olive oil production. Harvesting is easy since the trees are typically low to the ground and allow for easy hand picking. Oils made from Arbequina are generally buttery, fruity, and very mild in flavor, being low in polyphenols. The combination of low polyphenol levels and high levels of polyunsaturated fat as compared with other olive cultivars means that it has relatively low stability and short shelf-life. Cross breeding Hybridization using the Arbequina and Picual (Rallo et al 2008) resulted in the newer Chiquitota variety.

She previously worked as a journalist for television broadcaster TV Azteca. Career =As a journalist= T√©llez was born in Hermosillo but spent her childhood in Ensenada, Baja California. From 1984 to 1994, she worked at Canal 6 in Hermosillo, where she received the State Journalism Award in 1992. In 1994, she was hired to host the morning edition of TV Azteca's main news program, Hechos, and to be an investigative journalist. In 1999, she became a full-time investigative journalist. On June 22, 2000, her car was shot by a group of unknown men, but she was unharmed. She attributed this attack to a recent airing of an investigation related to the Arellano F√©lix family of drug dealers; the case was closed with no suspects found. In 2005, she began a new investigative program for Azteca Trece, Mitos y Hechos (Myths and Facts), broadcast twice a month. The program came to an end when TV Azteca, evidently ceding to government pressure, did not air the third part of a report on the sale of Grupo Financiero Banamex to Citigroup and the controversy surrounding the winding down of the Fobaproa bank contingency fund. In 2007, T√©llez received the Premio Antena award from the National Chamber of the Radio and Television Industry (CIRT) for her broadcasting career. In 2010, she debuted the program Diagn√≥stico reservado (Diagnosis Reserved) on Proyecto 40. T√©llez later left TV Azteca to write columns and make video content for the digital news site SDP Noticias. =Election as senator= In November 2017, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador contacted T√©llez and offered to run her as a Senate candidate from his National Regeneration Movement (Morena) party from the state of Sonora. Two months later, T√©llez announced in an interview with Ciro G√≥mez Leyva on Radio F√≥rmula that she would take up the offer, though she would not become a Morena party member. She would run alongside Alfonso Durazo Monta√±o, a longtime politician and public official in the state, as the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition candidates for Senate from Sonora. The ticket obtained 200,000 more votes than the PRI ticket, putting it in first place and securing seats for T√©llez and Durazo in the Senate. In August 2018, T√©llez announced she would file an injunction against several constitutional reforms approved in the Sonora state government that reduce the power of the state legislature. Opposition to these reforms, which T√©llez described as a \\"dictatorial smackdown by Governor Claudia Pavlovich Arellano\\", has been particularly vociferous within Morena, as the party won 20 of the 21 district seats in the Sonoran state legislature in the 2018 midterm elections. On December 16, 2019, the Comisi√≥n de Justicia (Justice Commission) of Morena demanded the expulsion of Lilly T√©llez from her position as a member of the party's Senate caucus, primarily due to her opposition to the legalization of abortion. On 3 June 2020, T√©llez joined the National Action Party. Personal life T√©llez was married in 2003 to businessman Guillermo Calder√≥n Villalobos in Mexico City.

A boilermaker is a tradesperson who fabricates steel, iron, or copper into boilers and other large containers intended to hold hot gas or liquid, as well as maintains and repairs boilers and boiler systems.Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition, Boilermakers, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and- extraction/boilermakers.htm (visited January 23, 2014) Although the name originated from craftsmen who made boilers, boilermakers in fact assemble, maintain, and repair other large vessels and closed vats. The boilermaker trade evolved from industrial blacksmithing; in the early nineteenth century, a boilermaker was called a boilersmith. The involvement of boilermakers in the shipbuilding and engineering industries came about because of the changeover from wood to iron as a construction material. It was often easier, and less expensive, to hire a boilermaker who was already in the shipyardfabricating iron boilers for wooden steamshipsto build a ship. This overlap of skills could extend to anything large and made of ironor later, steel. In the UK, this effective monopoly over an important skill of the industrial revolution led to boilermakers being labeled 'the labour aristocracy\\" by historians. Application Boilermaking, welding, and fitting tubes can be a full-time requirement at power plants. Stress fractures, leaks, and corrosion demand continual repair or replacement resulting from operation at very high steam pressures. Other boilermakers might work seasonally or on an individual project such as re-fitting a boiler in a seagoing vessel or remodeling a steam plant. Boiler repair can be a high-value, high-cost service since even the smallest steam boilers for dry cleaners and tailors can cost upwards of $20,000 to replace. =Domestic boilers in the United States of America= In the United States, many boilermakers are employed in repairing, repiping, and re-tubing commercial steam and hot water boilers used for heating and domestic hot water in commercial buildings and multi-family dwellings. Sometimes these boilers are referred to as pressure vessels. Generally, a pressure vessel is a storage tank or vessel that has been designed to operate at pressures above . The two main responsibilities of boilermakers are the use of oxy-acetylene gas torch sets to cut or gouge steel plate and tubes, followed by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), or gas metal arc welding (GMAW) to attach and mend the cut sections of tubes and steel plates.Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition, Boilermakers, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/boilermakers.htm (visited January 23, 2014) Training and certification in the United States Boilermakers usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes about four years of paid on-the-job training combined with classroom instruction. Unions and many employers offer these apprenticeships. To become an apprentice, one must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or GED. Attending a trade or technical school combined with employer-provided training can accelerate the learning curve.Employment and Training Administration, US Department of Labor, O*NET Online, Boilermakers, on the Internet at http://online.onetcenter.org/link/details/47-2011.00 (visited January 23, 2014) =R Stamp Welding= Boiler repair in the United States is governed by the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) under a classification called R Stamp Welding. In order to perform R Stamp welds and repairs, boilermakers are tested and certified in the quality of their weld joints through a rigorous testing procedure. R stamps are issued to companies that have existing ASME code stamps issued for construction and whose quality control system covers repairs or follow the guidelines set up by ASME to obtain an R stamp. Welders identify their welds by stamping their identifying welder number adjacent to their completed weld with a set of steel stencils. =Power Piping= Welding, fitting, and installing the tubes and accessories that attach to the boiler can also be performed by boilermakers, and is governed by the same organizations as R Stamp Welding. This certification is called Power Piping and is governed by ASME Code section B31.1. Trade unions =United States and Canada= The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers is a labor union for boilermakers in Canada and the United States. =UK= In the UK, boilermakers traditionally joined the Boilermakers Society which merged with the General and Municipal Workers' Union (GMWU), then an unskilled union, to form the modern GMB which still maintains a \\"craft section\\" largely for boilermakers.

It was developed by Bell Labs. It is used to provide the voice mail system the information it needs to process the call. Each time a call is sent to the voice mail system, a message is sent using SMDI over a serial interface that identifies the line, the type of call, and the calling/called party numbers. The SMDI protocol also specifies a method for turning the message-waiting indicator (MWI) on and off on individual telephones. Some of the more recent voicemail systems transmit the SMDI protocol over a network TCP session rather than a serial interface.

Calls are distributed to the call answering points with normal call processing or using multiline hunt group (MLHG) features. One or more MLHGs may be associated with the same set of SMDI data links. An identification scheme is assigned in the SPCS to identify each MLHG uniquely and each line in the MLHG, for which call information (e.g., calling number) is provided over the SMDI data link.

Daughter of the Waves) is a neighborhood of Haifa, Israel, located at the foot of Mt. Carmel on the Mediterranean coast. Bat Galim is known for its promenade and sandy beaches. The neighborhood spans from Rambam hospital in the North to the Haifa Cable Cars in the South, and from the Mediterranean Sea's shore line in the West to Bat Galim's train station on the East. History Bat Galim was the first point of Jewish settlement in modern Haifa. The neighborhood was established in the 1920s as a garden suburb of private homes designed by the Bauhaus architect Richard Kauffmann. During the British Mandate, Bat Galim was Haifa's entertainment center. The \\"Casino,\\" a landmark building on the Bat Galim promenade, housed a cafe patronized by British officers, although it was never used for gambling. It was also the center of water sports in the country, and a swimming pool was built there.Rule Britannia: The British Influence and the Maccabiah Games File:Bat Galim 1932.jpgBat Galim 1932 1:20,000 File:Haifa 1945.jpgBat Galim 1945 1:250,000 Landmarks Rappaport Faculty of Medicine Rambam Medical Center, the Technion's Faculty of Medicine and the Rappaport Family Institute for Research in the Medical Sciences are situated in the north of Bat Galim, near the shore. Bat Galim and nearby neighborhoods are served by the Haifa Bat Galim railway station. Bat Galim is the lower station of the Haifa Cable Car, which runs up and down the Carmel from Stella Maris. Demographics Bat Galim is a mixed neighborhood consisting of families from many different nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds including Jewish families who lived there prior to WWII, hence there's a large elderly presence, many immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Christian and Muslim minorities. In the last several years, Bat Galim has seen an inception of medical students, both native and international, who come to study and intern at the Rambam hospital. The neighborhood also has an eclectic community with many self proclaimed artists and artisans who started an annual tradition where they open their homes to the public for a few days in September to showcase and sell their crafts which include hand-made pottery, glass art, jewelry, photographs and paintings of the neighborhood. This annual event attracts people from all over the country and also features live music, entertainment for the kids, lectures, architectural tours of the city and a speech by the Mayor of Haifa. Beach and surfing Bat Galim is a popular location for surfers, including wave, wind and kite surfing, year round, with many international competitions taking place there. Among the surfers, there are many swimmers, with three supervised beaches along the shore including the popular \\"Lagoona\\" beach specifically for swimmers and the \\"Backdoor\\" beach for wave surfers.

It is located approximately south of the city centre of Vancouver, British Columbia, and approximately north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border at Blaine, Washington. Construction, costing approximately $16.6 million in 1959 ($140 million in 2017), began on the tunnel in March 1957, and it was opened to traffic on May 23, 1959 as the Deas Island Tunnel. Queen Elizabeth II attended the official opening ceremony of the tunnel on July 15, 1959. It carries a four-lane divided highway under the south arm of the Fraser River estuary, joining the City of Richmond to the north with the City of Delta to the south. It is the only road tunnel below sea level in Canada, making its roadway the lowest road surface in Canada. The Massey Tunnel was the first to use immersed tube technology in North America. The tunnel forms part of Highway 99. It is named for Nehamiah \\"George\\" Massey, a former Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He represented Delta between 1956 and 1960, and was a long-time advocate of a permanent crossing to replace the Ladner Ferry that crossed the south arm of the Fraser River. The tunnel was renamed the George Massey Tunnel in 1967, three years after Massey died. It is still sometimes referred to by its previous name, the Deas Island Tunnel. Dangerous goods are not allowed to pass through the tunnel. Earlier proposals Winter ice floes and spring flooding, which made ferry navigation hazardous, prompted the demand for a bridge. In 1927, the BC legislature authorized the Fraser River Bridge Company to build a toll bridge linking Ladner to Lulu Island. In 1931, despite opposition that wanted the crossing located at New Westminster, the province fixed the site of the proposed crossing at or near Deas Island. The Municipality of Richmond, engaging the Ladner Bridge Company, submitted to government plans for the $2,600,000 toll bridge. That year, the federal government authorized construction of connecting highways, financing was in place, and preliminary construction work commenced. Ongoing opposition from the New Westminster municipality, and a change in the provincial government in 1933, changed the proposed location in 1934 to become the Pattullo Bridge at New Westminster. Configuration The tunnel is a single tube that is subdivided with a concrete wall, each side containing two traffic lanes. The typical traffic flow has two northbound lanes in the east tube and two southbound lanes in the west tube. In 1981 a counterflow system was introduced to meet increasing traffic demand in the tunnel. At peak rush traffic periods, a reversible lane system is used, with a series of swing gates deployed that direct traffic in one direction to a single lane, while increasing the other direction to three lanes. Morning rush has three lanes northbound (inbound to Vancouver) and evening rush has three southbound lanes (outbound from Vancouver). Construction and maintenance The tunnel is long and made up of six precast concrete sections (length: ; height: ; width: ). The sections were floated into position by barge and then sunk into a shallow trench that had been dug into the loose sand and silt of the river bed. The trench and tunnel sections were then covered over with a protective layer of rock‚Äî stones filled out on each side, plus a bed of stones on top. A structure located at each end of the tunnel houses the main ventilation and pumping equipment. Concrete retaining walls make up the approaches, which extend out about from the ventilation buildings. At its lowest point the roadway is about below sea level, making it the lowest section of roadway in Canada. The Fraser River flows into the Strait of Georgia about downstream from the tunnel. Due to the tunnel being designed and constructed in the 1950s, very little consideration was given to seismic factors. The river bed is a thick layer of sediment on top of bedrock. This sedimentary layer may liquefy during a major earthquake, leaving the tunnel with nothing to rest on, and thus vulnerable to total collapse. In recent years, as the awareness of the effect of serious seismic activity developed, an engineering assessment and subsequent retrofit project was initiated to increase the survivability of the tunnel in the event of a significant earthquake. This retrofit project started in the fall of 2004 and had been completed by the spring of 2006. In the interest of providing active protection for commuters from the danger earthquakes pose to the tunnel, an earthquake early warning system called Shakealarm was installed and commissioned in 2009. This was the first application of a commercialized earthquake early warning system (EEWS) to protect critical infrastructure in North America. Capable of detecting earthquakes with seconds to minutes of warning time the installation on George Massey Tunnel is designed to close the gates at either end of the tunnel so that no one can enter if a dangerous quake is inbound, and those already inside can exit as normal before shaking begins. The tunnel was constructed for the British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridge Authority, and is now administered by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation. It has not had a toll on it since the 1960s, when tolls were removed from all of the bridges and tunnels in the Lower Mainland. The initial toll was 25 cents; in 1964, George Massey became the last person to pay the toll, which was then 1 dollar. Non-motorized tunnel use The tunnel is illegal for cyclists or pedestrians to traverse. A limited fare-free shuttle service is available year-round, during certain hours, and can carry tandems. Cyclists must wait at prescribed pickup points, but the van will make more than one trip if there are more than seven bicycles. Translink also provides year-round regular bus service through the tunnel with standard two-bike carrying racks. However, the lack of sufficient rack space translates to long waits for cyclists during peak hours. Cycling advocates have long advocated for improvement to this facility, as it is a major choke point limiting Vancouver-to-Tsawwassen Ferry bicycle traffic. Height limit The tunnel has a posted height limit of in both directions. The replacement bridge, which was to be constructed starting in 2017, would have likely eliminated the current height restrictions for over-height vehicles in the tunnel.  Replacement  On February 16, 2006, it was reported that the provincial government had plans to expand the tunnel's capacity, from four lanes to six, dubbed the \\"H99\\" project. On September 28, 2012, Premier Christy Clark announced plans to replace the aging tunnel within 10 years, addressing the congestion and safety issues currently plaguing the structure. On November 21, 2012, it was announced that the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is leading a multi-stage planning initiative, including seeking public input on replacement options for the tunnel to determine a number of options for its replacement. On September 20, 2013, Premier Clark announced that construction on a new bridge to replace the tunnel will begin in 2017. On December 16, 2015, British Columbia Transportation Minister Todd Stone announced detailed plans to spend $3.5 billion on a bridge and interchange improvements to replace the tunnel. In July 2016 the BC Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) started an environmental assessment of the project and on February 9, 2017 the replacement received environment approval from the B.C. Ministry of Environment. Preliminary work went out for tender in January 2017 to start the process of improving ground conditions for the future widening of the project area. The Metro Vancouver mayors spoke out against the replacement plan in June 2016, marking \\"the first time the mayors, who make up the Metro Vancouver Board, have spoken out collectively against the $3.5-billion crossing.\\" The mayors sent a letter to the B.C. government and the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, to get the federal government to do an environmental review of the project. In February 2017, the federal government denied the request of the mayors for a federal review. The official groundbreaking for the project took place on April 5, 2017 and was met with protesters. With the election of a new provincial government in 2017, the NDP Premier John Horgan scrapped the project in favour of a solution with more research and consultation with the Metro Vancouver mayors. On October 2, 2019 the Metro Vancouver mayors recommended a new 8-lane tunnel as the replacement of the Massey Tunnel.

Agronomic characteristics  The term empeltre is related to the Catalan word empelt or the Aragonese impelte, which means \\"graft\\". This is due to the fact that this type of olive tree has a very low rooting capacity, which forces the graft to be derived as a form of reproduction. The olive trees of the Empeltre variety have a large wingspan as well as bright dark green leaves and early maturing black olives. They have a long form, asymmetrical and slightly pumped by the back. They have an average volume of 2.7 grams with a pulp / bone ratio of 5:3 and a yield of 18.3%.

It is for boilermakers and related occupations, and is affiliated with both the AFL-CIO and CLC. The Boilermakers union has a four-year apprenticeship training program before becoming a Journeyman. Boilermakers primarily work in nuclear and fossil power plants. However they also work in shipyards, refineries and chemical plants. The work involves welding, rigging and fabricating. All work done is governed by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration).  History  = Formation = The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers was founded on September 1, 1893. On that day, at a meeting in Chicago, Illinois, representatives from the International Brotherhood of Boiler Makers and Iron Ship Builders, which had been organized on October 1, 1880, and the National Brotherhood of Boiler Makers, which had been formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in May 1888, resolved to consolidate their organizations. It was further agreed that the new organization, to be known as the Brotherhood of Boiler Makers and Iron Ship Builders of America, would make its headquarters in Kansas City, Kansas. = Affiliation with AFL = Two and a half years later, on the ninth of June 1896, the Brotherhood affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. = Helpers Division = In subsequent years, the Brotherhood continued to grow, and in 1902, the Helpers division was formed. Because helpers were barred from sitting in the lodge room with mechanics, this new division had its own local unions and was entirely separate from the Boiler Makers. This would change a decade later when the Helpers Division would be consolidated with the Mechanics Division. = Name change = In March 1906, at a special Convention in Kansas City, the name of the Union was changed to the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and Helpers of America in order to incorporate the newest division. Also at this time, the term \\"Boiler Makers\\" was condensed into one word, \\"Boilermakers.\\" = Affiliation with AFL- CIO = The Boilermakers affiliated with the Building Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor in February 1931. At the turn of the century, total membership stood at about 8,500, but by 1944, due in part to dramatic increases in the shipbuilding, railroad, and fabrication shop industries during World War II, the Boilermakers numbered over 350,000. = First merger = In 1954, the Boilermakers merged their organization with the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop Forgers and Helpers. The International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths had been organized in 1889 and added Helpers to both their membership and their name in 1901. = Second merger and name change = A 1919 merger with the Brotherhood of Drop Forgers created the union that, on June 29, 1953, merged with the Boilermakers to create the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. A year later, a new International seal was adopted to include all crafts. = Health and Welfare Fund = On October 1, 1954, the Boilermaker National Health and Welfare Fund was established, on November 9, 1959, the Boilermakers National Joint Apprenticeship Fund began, and the Boilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust became effective October 1, 1960. = Construction Division = Delegates to the 1977 convention voted to establish a Construction Division at International Headquarters for the purpose of servicing those members with employment in, or related to, the construction industry. = Third merger = On March 15, 1984, the delegates to the Special Merger Convention of the United Cement, Lime, Gypsum and Allied Workers International Union voted to merge with the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. The merger of the CLGAW, formed in 1936, and its 10,000 members who dominate the building products and supplies industry, and the Boilermakers forged an organization with a greater ability to provide services to its members. = Fourth merger = On October 1, 1994, a merger was consummated with the Stove, Furnace and Allied Appliance Workers International Union‚Äîa skilled trade union that was organized in 1891. The Stove Workers, with 5,800 members, became a division of the International Brotherhood known as the Stove, Furnace, Energy and Allied Appliance Workers Division. The word energy was inserted to give special recognition to coal miners within that division. The division had its members employed primarily in the manufacturing of stoves and various types of appliances. = Fifth merger = During the same period, merger talks were also being carried out with an independent union known as the Western Energy Workers. This one-local union, formed in 1978 with members employed in the coal strip-mining, signed a merger agreement with the Boilermakers effective December 1, 1994. = Sixth merger = In October 1996, a merger agreement was made with the Metal Polishers, Buffers, Platers and Allied Workers International Union. This union was also an old line, skilled trade union that was organized in 1892. This merger brought 4,000 new members to the Brotherhood. These members are employed primarily in plating and polishing shops within the United States and Canada. = International president = On July 24, 2003, International President Charles W. Jones resigned his office, and the International Executive Council elected Newton B. Jones to complete his unexpired term. Newton B. Jones is a 44-year member of the Boilermakers union. After being elected to fill the unexpired term of International President Charles W. Jones, who retired after 20 years in office and 60 years of service to the Brotherhood, Newton Jones was unanimously reelected to the Boilermakers‚Äô top leadership position in 2006 and 2011, during the union's 31st and 32nd Consolidated Conventions. In 2016, at the 33rd Consolidated Convention, he was reelected International President by an overwhelming margin. Newton presently serves as a Vice President on the AFL-CIO Executive Council and as Chairman of the Materials Sector of IndustriALL, an international labor federation comprising 50 million workers in 140 countries. Since 2003, he has also served as Chairman of Brotherhood Bank & Trust. In 2008 he was unanimously chosen by the Brotherhood Bank and Trust Board of Directors to also serve as its Chief Executive Officer.

He co-founded and ran McClure's Magazine from 1893 to 1911, which ran numerous expos√©es of wrongdoing in business and politics, such as those written by Ida Tarbell, Ray Stannard Baker, and Lincoln Steffens. The magazine ran fiction and nonfiction by the leading writers of the day, including Sarah Orne Jewett, Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, Joel Chandler Harris, Jack London, Stephen Crane, William Allen White and Willa Cather. Biography He was born to an Ulster Scots family in County Antrim in what is now Northern Ireland, and emigrated with his widowed mother to Indiana when he was nine years old. He grew up in near poverty on a farm and graduated from Valparaiso High School in 1875. He worked his way through Knox College, where he co-founded its student newspaper, and later moved to New York City. In 1884, he established the McClure Syndicate, the first U.S. newspaper syndicate,Charles Fanning, The Exiles of Erin: Nineteenth-Century Irish- American Fiction (2nd ed. Chester Springs: Dufour Editions, 1997), 13. and published in Sunday newspapers, containing serials of books, recipes and reviews. Cover of January 1901 issue of McClure's Magazine He founded McClure's Magazine in 1893 and ran it successfully until 1911 when poor health and financial reorganization forced him out (and many of his writers had defected to form their own magazine). McClure's Magazine published influential pieces by respected journalists and authors including Jack London, Ida Tarbell, Upton Sinclair, Burton J. Hendrick, Rudyard Kipling, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, Willa Cather, and Lincoln Steffens. Through his magazine, he introduced Dr. Maria Montessori's new teaching methods to North America in 1911.Peter Lyon, Success story: The life and times of SS McClure(1967). McClure was a business partner of Frank Nelson Doubleday in Doubleday & McClure, ancestor to today's Doubleday imprint. After McClure left Doubleday, he established the publisher McClure, Phillips and Company with John Sanborn Phillips. Phillips left to purchase The American Magazine in 1906 and McClure sold his book publishing operations to Doubleday, Page in 1908.\\"A Great Combined Holiday List\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, December 18, 1908, page 9. This panel advertisement by Doubleday, Page displays among the book listings: \\"McClure's Books including the works of more than 200 well-known authors Now published by Doubleday, Page & Company\\". A different advertisement in The New York Times next day, p. BR789, features the Children's Crimson Classics series edited by Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora Archibald Smith, without change in series name or prices of previous volumes. Promotional items in October 1907 newspapers present \\"The McClure Company\\" as successor to \\"McClure, Phillips & Co.\\" After he was ousted in 1911, McClure's Magazine serialized his autobiography, ghost-written by one of the magazine's editors, Willa Cather. McClure created a whole new form of writing for his journalists that we still use today. Instead of demanding that his writers give him articles for his paper immediately, he would give them all the time they needed to do extensive research on their topics. Rudyard Kipling was one writer who rejected McClure's offer of a long term contract, quoting as justification Ecclesiasticus (Chapt. 33, verse 21): \\"As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any\\". Kipling was also present when McClure began to contemplate the launch of a new literary magazine. He recalled in his autobiography: He died in New York City in 1949, at the age of 92. He is buried next to his wife Harriet at Hope Cemetery in Galesburg, Illinois. Legacy According to his biographer Peter Lyon, McClure was, \\"one of the greatest instinctive editors ever to function in the US, and one of the most wretched businessmen.\\" Lyon suggests that he had a manic-depressive personality, combining enthusiasm, tenacity, and a remarkable talent for predicting public responses. He favored Western writers, and especially muckraking articles that made his magazine famous. On the other hand, he was unstable with a hair-trigger impatience that alienated many staffers. Always in the red, he sold first his book publishing house, then his nationwide newspaper syndicate, and finally his own magazine.Peter Lyon, \\"McClure, Samuel Sidney\\" in John A.

She is better known for her work in the World Wrestling Federation under her ring name The Kat. During her tenure in the World Wrestling Federation, she held the Women's Championship once, although she was not a trained wrestler. During the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 1999, she flashed her breasts in what was an early instance of intentional nudity in the WWF. After the event, she was shown nude several more times on other pay-per-views. She is also an ex-wife of wrestler and color-commentator Jerry Lawler, who quit the WWF after Carter was released in early 2001 but returned after their divorce in July 2001. She currently works on the independent circuit under her real name. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Federation (1999‚Äì2001)= Stacy Carter first appeared on World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s flagship program, Raw is War, in August 1999. She debuted as Miss Kitty, an assistant to Debra, appointed to her by Jeff Jarrett, whom Debra managed.Jerry Lawler, It's Good to Be the King ... Sometimes, p. 337. The partnership ended when Jarrett left the company after losing the Intercontinental Championship to Chyna at No Mercy. Because Jarrett was departing the company after the match, Carter began managing Chyna, and then started dressing in 'Chyna-like' clothing and wearing a black wig. At Armageddon in December 1999, Miss Kitty won her only WWF Women's Championship in a Four Corners Evening Gown Pool match by defeating then- champion Ivory, Jacqueline, and Barbara \\"BB\\" Bush by stripping them of their gowns. The special guest referees were The Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young. After the match, Miss Kitty stripped out of her dress in celebration and quickly flashed the crowd her breasts. This was the first instance of intentional nudity in the WWF.Lawler, p. 339. The following evening, she announced before successfully defending her title in a Chocolate Pudding Match that she was changing her name to The Kat. The Kat then appeared at the Royal Rumble in the 'Miss Royal Rumble Swimsuit Contest', where she appeared in a bikini made out of bubble wrap.Lawler, p. 350. The contest, however, was won by Mae Young. She lost the Championship on the January 31 edition of Raw to Hervina in a Lumberjill Snowbunny match, a match that took place in a snow filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers whose purpose was to keep The Kat and Hervina from leaving the pool. The Kat then began an on-screen rivalry with Terri Runnels, although neither were fully trained wrestlers. At WrestleMania 2000, Runnels (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the special guest referee, but he was distracted during the match when Young kissed him, which allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring. When Venis saw her out of the ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping off her pants to expose her thong. The feud continued, and the duo had an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. Carter was victorious, but after the match, Runnels pulled The Kat's top off, exposing her breasts, which Carter allowed instead of acting disgusted or embarrassed. The two women continued to feud throughout the summer, often in mixed tag matches. In June 2000, Carter attempted to regain the Women's Championship by entering a battle royal to become the #1 contender, but she was eliminated by her rival Terri. The feud resurfaced in a 'Thong Stink Face' match at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by performing a stinkface on Runnels. In early 2001, The Kat began a new storyline with a stable called the Right to Censor, a group of wrestlers purportedly wanting to rein in the vulgarity of the \\"Attitude Era,\\" during which she demanded equal time for the \\"right for nudity\\". At No Way Out, Jerry Lawler, who was representing The Kat, lost a match to Steven Richards, the head of the stable, after The Kat mistakenly hit Lawler with the Women's Championship belt. As a result of Lawler losing the match, she was forced to join the stable. On February 27, 2001, however, Carter was released from the WWF in the middle of the storyline. As a result, her husband Jerry Lawler also quit the company.Lawler, p. 403. According to Lawler, Carter was released from the WWF because Vince McMahon decided to end the angle with the Right to Censor.Lawler, p. 405. Other insiders cite Carter's negative backstage attitude as the reason for her dismissal.R. D. Reynolds and Blade Braxton. The WrestleCrap Book of Lists! (140) =Independent circuit (2001, 2010)= Carter at an Independent event in 2010. After Carter and Lawler left the World Wrestling Federation, they worked various independent wrestling events. They also signed with Tri-Star Productions and worked at Memphis Championship Wrestling. Carter made her debut for Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA) on June 5, 2010 at the TWA Homecoming event in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, where she teamed up with Demolition (Ax and Smash) in a winning effort defeating Sheeta and The Nigerian Nightmares (Maifu and Saifu) in a 6-person mixed-tag team match. Carter made her debut for Stranglehold Wrestling (SHW) on August 26, 2010 at the Stranglehold Devils Playground Tour in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, where she competed in an Arm-Wrestling match against Pissed off Pete in a no-contest. Later that event, Carter accompied Sinn Bohdi to the ring where he competed against George Terzis. Personal life Stacy Carter's family was originally from West Memphis, Arkansas.Lawler, p. 264. After her parents divorced, Carter's mother moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Stacy Carter, however, as well as her younger brother and sister, continued to live with their father, who worked as a policeman, in Arkansas. Carter moved to Memphis to live with her mother, Cathy, after graduating from high school. Stacy Carter met Jerry Lawler, her future husband, at a charity softball game at Treadwell High School in Memphis on July 23, 1989, two months before her nineteenth birthday.Lawler, p. 333. She was attending the game with her mother, who was dating one of the players on the team for which Lawler also played. Lawler, however, was married at the time, and he claims that when he initially met Carter, he considered an affair. After Lawler separated from his wife, Carter moved in with him. When Carter first met Lawler, she was working as a bank teller. Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio, and she also opened and ran her own hair salon. Lawler and Carter married in September 2000. While they were together, former professional wrestler Missy Hyatt offered Carter $10,000 to pose nude on her website, but Carter refused the offer.Lawler, p. 305. Carter decided to leave Lawler in July 2001, and they separated not long after.Lawler, p. 415. She left pro wrestling upon separating from Jerry Lawler. She worked in the field of real estate in Lee County, Florida for Century 21 for some time after the divorce.Lawler, p. 448. Carter and professional wrestler Nick Cvjetkovich announced their engagement on June 12, 2010.

Biography Blackman-Woods is from Northern Ireland and was educated at the University of Ulster, graduating with a BSc degree and later a PhD in Social Science. Following this she was employed by Newcastle City Council, before going on to pursue a career in academia. As a sociologist with expertise in housing, she served as Professor of Social Policy and an Associate Dean in the School of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Northumbria prior to her election, and had previously been Dean of Social and Labour studies at Ruskin College, Oxford and head of policy at the Local Government Information Unit. Blackman-Woods had previously been Chair of the City of Durham Constituency Labour Party and before that in Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend. She has also served as a Councillor on Oxford and Newcastle City Councils.Roberta Blackman-Woods MP, a brief biography Parliamentary career In 2004, Blackman-Woods was selected as the Labour candidate for the City of Durham constituency through an All-Women Shortlist.Profile, parliament.uk; accessed 9 May 2015. In her previous work she had been known by her maiden name, Roberta Woods, but added her husband's surname, Blackman, after selection to avoid confusion with Liberal Democrat candidate Carol Woods. Elected at the 2005 general election with a majority of 3,274, Blackman-Woods made her maiden speech to the House of Commons on 24 May 2005, making reference to the work of her predecessor Gerry Steinberg, the importance to Durham of Durham Cathedral, the University of Durham and the historic legacy of mining within the area. Blackman-Woods was a member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments from 2005‚Äì2010 and has also been a member of the Education and Skills Select committee and the Business, Innovation, Science and Skills Select Committee. In 2006 she became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Hilary Armstrong. This post lasted until Armstrong returned to the backbenches when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, but Blackman-Woods was then appointed PPS to the Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, in 2007. Following Des Brown's retirement to the backbenches she served as PPS to David Lammy MP as Minister of State for Higher Education. She was also Chair of the All Party Afghanistan Group from 2005 and the All Party Balanced and Sustainable Communities Group from 2007. Blackman-Woods was also a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter- Parliamentary Union throughout her Parliamentary career. In 2010, she was re- elected to Parliament with a majority of 3,067, and was appointed Shadow Minister for Business in June 2010, before being moved to shadow the Civil Society Minister by new Labour Leader Ed Miliband in October 2010. In the October 2011 shadow cabinet re-shuffle, Blackman-Woods was moved to become Shadow Minister in Communities and Local Government covering planning policy and procurement. In 2015, she was re-elected with a majority of 11,439, and was confirmed as the shadow housing minister.http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/policy/politics/central- government/labour-appoints-new-shadow-housing-minister/7009861.article She resigned from the front bench in June 2016, before supporting Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election. She subsequently rejoined the front bench on Corbyn's re-election. She was re-elected in 2017 with a majority of 12,362, and in July 2017 she was appointed as a Shadow International Development Minister. On 16 July 2019 she announced that she would not be standing at the next general election for family reasons. She gave her valedictory speech in the House of Commons on 5 November 2019.

It is approximately 15 miles (24 km) long, located on the river downstream from the town of De Beque, in eastern Mesa County. The canyon forms a narrow passage where the river passes along the western end of the Grand Mesa. At its lower end, the canyon opens out on the eastern end of the Grand Valley at the town of Palisade, approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of Grand Junction. Interstate 70 follows the river through the canyon. Geologically the canyon walls are stairstep cliffs of Mesaverde Group, shoreline sands deposited during the Cretaceous. The sedimentary rock layers contain several low-sulfur coal seams that thicken to as much as 50 feet (15 m) at the Cameo Mine near Mile 46 on Interstate 70. The coal is typically soft bituminous coal, since it has never been compressed by overlying rocks to the degree that would be required to form harder coal.

An officer so promoted was referred to as being brevetted (for example, \\"he was brevetted Major General\\"). The promotion would be noted in the officer's title (for example, \\"Bvt. Maj. Gen. Joshua L. Chamberlain\\" or \\"Bvt. Col. Arthur MacArthur\\"). It is not to be confused with a Brevet d'√©tat- major in Francophone European military circles, where it is an award, nor should it be confused with temporary commissions. France In France, a brevet is a very broad-meaning word which includes every document giving a capacity to a person. For instance, the various military speciality courses, such as military parachutism, are ended by the award of a brevet. The more important brevet in the French military is the one of the √âcole de guerre, the French Staff College. Between 1870 and 1940, an officier brevet√© was a graduate of the √âcole sup√©rieure de guerre. Nowadays, while many officers still attend the √©cole de guerre, they do not use the term officier brevet√©. The French military does not use brevets to give officers a higher standing. It uses instead temporary commissions.Code de la D√©fense, art. L4134-2. As an example, Charles de Gaulle was promoted \\"provisional brigadier general\\" (g√©n√©ral de brigade √† titre provisoire) in 1940 when he was commander of an armoured division. Germany In the Prussian and German army and navy, it was possible to bestow a Charakter rank on officers that was in many respects similar to a brevet rank. For example, an Oberst could receive the Charakter als Generalmajor. Very often, German officers would be promoted to the next higher Charakter rank on the day of their retirement. Spain It was not uncommon during the 19th century to distinguish between empleo (\\"employed\\") rank and graduaci√≥n (\\"grade\\") being the effective command position. In the 1884 rank regulations (which with minor modifications were in force during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War) stars marked the rank whilst the actual post was reflected in gold lace on the cuffs. As in practice both situations coincided the system was dropped in 1908 leaving only the starred system of denoting rank. Nevertheless, during the Spanish Civil War the system was revived in the Nationalist side due to the lack of trained officers because of the enlargement of the army. The breveted officers (known as habilitados or estampillados) wore their actual rank on the cuffs but their brevetted one in a rectangular black patch on the left breast of their coats or shirts. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom the brevet commission was only by courtesy. Officially, both titles were used, as: \\"Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Cornwallis\\". Originally the term designated a promotion given on such occasions as a coronation, or the termination of a great war, and had its origin during the reign of King James II (1685‚Äì1688); but it was abused so frequently and used to such an extent by the general award of brevet commissions that from 1854, during the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1856 and subsequently, its bestowal was limited strictly to cases of very distinguished service in the field and on the principle of seniority. The British Army confined brevet commissions to ranks from captain to lieutenant-colonel. The brevet conferred rank in the British Army overall, but importantly, not in the regiment. Advancement in the regiment could take place generally only by purchase until 1871 or by seniority, with the exception of the Royal Regiment of Artillery and the Royal Engineers where it has never been possible to buy commissions and promotion was based on merit, and when there was a suitable vacancy caused by the death, retirement or promotion of a more senior officer. For an officer on duty with his regiment, only regimental rank counted. If the regiment formed part of a larger formation then brevet rank could be used to determine command of temporary units formed for special purposes. In particular brigadier did not become a permanent rank until 1947, so command of brigades was determined by seniority, including by the date of promotion to any brevet rank. Thus it was possible for a regimental major to hold a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy with seniority over the commission of his own commanding officer as lieutenant-colonel and be given command of a brigade, potentially including his own regiment. Similarly, while the officer served in a staff position or as an aide-de-camp, then he could use his brevet rank. Appointment to a brevet also counted towards the requirement to have served for a sufficient time in a lower rank to be eligible for promotion (by purchase) to a more senior one. United States The Articles of War adopted by the United States Army in 1776 and slightly revised in 1806 established the use and significance of brevet ranks or awards in the U.S. Army. When first used, a brevet commission in the U.S. Army entitled the officer to be identified by a higher rank, but the award had limited effect on the right to higher command or pay. A brevet rank had no effect within the officer's current unit. When assigned duty at the brevet rank by the U.S. President, such an officer would command with the brevet rank and be paid at the higher rank.Hunt, \\"Introduction\\", p. v. This higher command and pay would last only for the duration of that assignment. The brevet promotion would not affect the officer's seniority and actual permanent rank in the army. Beginning on April 16, 1818, brevet commissions also required confirmation by the United States Senate, just as all other varieties of officer commissions did.Eicher, p. 34. =Early use= Brevets were first used in the U.S. Army during the American Revolutionary War. Often, the nation's Continental Congress could not find suitable positions for foreign officers‚Äîmostly from France‚Äîwho sought commissions. The first U.S. brevet was given to Jacques Antoine de Franchessin on July 20, 1776, allowing him to hold the rank of lieutenant colonel within the Continental Army. Franchessin and another 35 men of foreign birth would hold brevet commissions in the army by the end of the war. By 1784, an additional 50 officers would receive brevets for \\"meritorious services\\" during the conflict. In the 19th-century U.S. Army, brevet promotions were quite common because the army had many frontier forts to garrison and other missions to perform but could not always appoint appropriately ranked officers to command these forts or missions. The U.S. Congress permitted only a limited number of officers of each rank. Thus, an officer of lower rank might receive a brevet commission to a rank more appropriate for his assignment. Also, newly commissioned officers often received brevet rank until authorized positions became available.Faust, Patricia L., ed. Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War, p. 79. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, 1986. . For example, an officer might graduate from West Point and be appointed a brevet second lieutenant until a permanent second lieutenant posting opened up. In early 1861, some recent graduates of West Point temporarily were named brevet second lieutenants because not enough Regular Army officer vacancies were available to give them commissions as regular second lieutenants. In addition to officers being appointed to a brevet rank to temporarily serve in positions designated for higher-ranked officers (i.e., in lieu of promotion to permanent rank), officers might be awarded brevet rank as recognition for gallantry or meritorious service. =American Civil War= During the American Civil War, almost all senior officers received some form of brevet award, mainly during the final months of the war. But these awards were made for gallantry or meritorious service, rather than for command. In addition to the authorization in a previous law for awards of brevet ranks to Regular Army officers, an act of Congress of March 3, 1863, authorized the award of brevet rank to officers of the United States Volunteers.Boatner, III, Mark M., The Civil War Dictionary, p. 84, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, 1959. . Thus, brevet awards became increasingly common later in the war.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue, p. xvii. Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . Some officers even received more than one award. Because of the existence of both Regular Army and United States Volunteers ranks, and the possibility that an officer could hold actual and brevet ranks in both services, some general and other officers could hold as many as four different ranks simultaneously. For example, by the end of the war, Ranald S. Mackenzie was a brevet major general of volunteers, an actual, full-rank brigadier general of volunteers, a brevet brigadier general in the United States Regular Army, and an actual Regular Army captain. Brevet rank in the Union Army, whether in the Regular Army or the United States Volunteers, during and at the conclusion of the American Civil War, may be regarded as an honorary title which conferred none of the authority, precedence, nor pay of real or full rank.Boatner, III, p. 84. The vast majority of the Union Army brevet ranks were awarded posthumously or on or as of March 13, 1865, as the war was coming to a close. U.S. Army regulations concerning brevet rank provided that brevet rank could be claimed \\"in courts-martial and on detachments, when composed of different corps\\" and when the officer served with provisional formations made up of different regiments or companies, or \\"on other occasions\\". These regulations were vague enough to support the positions of some brevet generals who caused controversies by claiming supposed priorities or privileges of brevet ranks that had been awarded to them at earlier dates during the war. Some full-rank brigadier generals in the United States Volunteers (USV) in the American Civil War had been awarded brevet brigadier general rank in the USV before receiving full-rank promotions to brigadier general of United States Volunteers. Some full-rank brigadier generals in the USV were awarded the rank of brevet major general in the USV, but were not promoted to full-rank major generals in the USV. Some United States Regular Army officers who served with the USV in ranks below general officer were awarded brevet general officer rank in the USV, but were not promoted to full-rank general officers in the USV. On the other hand, at least a few USV general officers also were awarded brevet general officer rank in the Regular Army in addition to their full-rank appointments or brevet general officer awards in the United States Volunteers. Many of the Regular Army officers of lower rank who became full-rank USV generals, however, received neither actual promotions to a general officer rank nor brevet general officer awards in the Regular Army in addition to their USV ranks or awards. Some of them who stayed in the United States Regular Army after the war did achieve general officer rank in later years. In addition to the brevet awards to current (or future) full-rank United States Volunteers (USV) generals during the American Civil War, 1,367 other USV officers of lower ranks were awarded the rank of brevet brigadier general, brevet major general, or both, in the United States Volunteers, but not promoted to full-rank USV generals.Warner, Generals in Blue, p. xxiv. At least one enlisted man, Private Frederick W. Stowe, was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the Union Army during the Civil War.Faust, p .79. The Confederate States of America had legislation and regulations for the use of brevets in their armed forces, provided by Article 61 of the nation's Articles of War, and by their 1861 Army Regulations, which were based on the U.S. Army's 1857 version of their regulations. Although Article 61 was revised in 1862, it ultimately had no practical effect since the Confederate States Army did not use any brevet commissions or awards during its existence.Weinert, pp. 5‚Äì6; Faust, p. 79. The United States Marine Corps also issued brevets. After officers became eligible for the Medal of Honor, a rare Marine Corps Brevet Medal was issued to living officers who had been brevetted between 1861 and 1915. =Modern usage= The practice of brevetting disappeared from the (regular) U.S. military at the end of the 19th century; honors were bestowed instead with a series of medals. Brevetting was declared obsolete in 1922. However, the similar practice of frocking continues in four of the six branches of the U.S. armed forces. The U.S. Air Force does not allow the regular practice of frocking before a promotion date, except in rare circumstances, such as when an officer selected for promotion is assigned to a billet (typically a senior joint duty assignment), that requires them to hold/wear the higher rank to which they is expected to be promoted. Frocking typically requires special approval to be obtained from the service headquarters. The promotion of an enlisted person or non-commissioned officer to commissioned officer rank as a reward for displaying leadership and bravery is referred to as a direct appointment rather than a brevet. It temporarily grants up to the rank of first lieutenant. The holder must then attend Officer Candidate School in order to keep the commission. They must also have or acquire a four-year college degree if they wish to be promoted to the rank of captain or above. The U.S. National Guard, which depends on the governor of a state to concede its commissions in the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, may still confer brevets. Many states maintain a clause permitting the governor to confer any rank in its defense forces, including the militia and National Guards. Some states provide that the sitting governor may confer any rank, but this appointment is considered valid only for the duration of the governor's own term in office. Some states also confer brevets as part of their regular honors system. Georgia confers honorary ranks into its state police force. Kentucky is famous for its colonels, and so too is Tennessee, both of which make the appointment as an honorary member of the governor's staff. Alabama, Kentucky, Texas and Nebraska also confer flag officer ranks within a symbolic navy. Similar honors have been issued for the Georgia Naval Militia, which has existed only on paper since 1908. In all cases these honorary titles may be considered effective brevets, equal to that of the National Guard, by being conferred by a sitting governor.

United Kingdom =Royal Air Force= Royal Air Force Pilot Flying Badge In the RAF, the Flying Badge (colloquially referred to as wings or a brevet), is awarded upon the completion of a significant stage of flying training. Aircrew first undertake Elementary Flying Training, and are then streamed to either fast jet, helicopter, RPAS or multi-engine pipelines. The award of wings usually occurs upon completion of the secondary phase of training; for example, in the fast jet stream, wings are awarded upon completion of the Basic Fast Jet Course (BJFT), currently at RAF Linton-on-Ouse; for helicopter pilots, wings are awarded after they complete helicopter training at RAF Shawbury pre-OCU; for RPAS post-FTU (Formal Training Unit) and on the attainment of 'Limited Combat Ready' status, and for multi-engine aircrew, wings are awarded upon completion of their Multi-Engine Advanced Flying Training (MEAFT) training at RAF Cranwell. Aircrew, other than RPAS pilots, are then posted to their Operational Conversion Units having gained their wings, but still have a good deal of training and type familiarisation to complete before they are considered operational or front-line aircrew. Current Flying Badgespilots wear the letters \\"RAF\\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a swift's wing on each side. *weapons systems officers/operators (rear aircrew) wear the letters \\"RAF\\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a single swift's wing on one side. Legacy Rear Aircrew who qualified prior to April 2003, wear a single wing with no crown and a letter or letters (denoting speciality) in a brown laurel wreath, however, they may choose to wear the new WSO/WSOP Flying Badge. Legacy flying badges still in use in the RAF but no longer issued, include: *\\"N\\" for Navigator *\\"AE\\" for Air Electronics Officer/Operator *\\"LM\\" for Air Loadmaster *\\"E\\" for Air Engineer *\\"S\\" for Air Signaller (Airborne Linguist) For other members of a flying crew, who are not de facto Aircrew (but since 1 Apr 20 have been known as Airborne Specialists) and who come from ground trades/branches but are assigned to flying duties, they are awarded an Airborne Specialist Flying Badge upon completion of a bespoke flying training course, which is a half wing, without crown and 2 letters in the centre. This includes: *\\"FC\\" (fighter controller) flying badge ‚Äì Air Battle Managers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1. *\\"AT\\" (airborne technician) flying badge ‚Äì Ground Engineers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1 and RC-135W Rivet Joint platforms as in-flight technicians. *\\"IA\\" (Airborne imagery analyst) flying badge ‚Äì Intelligence Analysts assigned to fly on Sentinel R.1 in an Airborne Imagery Analyst role . RAF Catering Stewards assigned to fly as cabin crew on Voyager KC.1, BAe 146 and HS 125 are awarded the \\"CC\\" (cabin crew) badge. This badge is worn on the right sleeve in the same location as the parachute qualification, has two upturned wings (similar to Royal Navy ratings' aircrewman badges) and has cream stitching for the wings, lettering and laurels. Legacy Cabin Crew who qualified with the former \\"AS\\" (air steward) badge are still entitled to wear it. Parachute Jumping Instructors (PJIs) are honorary aircrew and wear an open parachute instead of a letter on a half wing. Obsolete Flying Badges An obselete bomb aimer's flying badge. There are also a number of obsolete rear aircrew flying badges that are no longer in use such as: *\\"AG\\" for Air Gunner *\\"B\\" for Air Bomber *\\"RO\\" for Radio Observer *\\"M\\" (meteorological observer) *\\"QM\\" (air quartermaster) *Observers wore a single wing attached directly to the letter \\"O\\", this was replaced by the Navigator's badge in 1942. *RPAS pilots initially had a separate flying badge, similar to traditional pilot wings excepting a light blue wreath, this was withdrawn on 1 April 2019. =Royal Navy= The Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm has its own wings design, bestowed in 1925 when it was the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force, featuring albatross wings instead of the wings of an eagle, as per the RAF design. The Fleet Air Arm wings badges also feature a crown and fouled anchor, reflecting the naval aspect of the flying undertaken. They are worn on the left sleeve of naval aviators, above the rank \\"rings\\" as opposed to on the left breast of uniforms, like the RAF and Army Air Corps. Unlike the RAF and the Army Air Corps, Naval aircrew are awarded their wings after Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), whereupon they are posted to a frontline squadron, the majority of their flying training complete. Therefore, while a Navy and RAF aircrew might take a similar amount of time to reach an operational squadron, the Naval officer has to wait until he has completed his conversion training to receive his wings. Royal Naval Observers are awarded their own aircrew flying badge, consisting of shorter wings either side of a fouled anchor surmounted by a Crown. Royal Naval Aircrewmen are awarded a flying badge similar in shape to the Observer wings, with slightly narrower wings and a similar anchor, but with no crown. Both observers and aircrewmen are also issued Wings upon completion of their OCU, like Royal Navy pilots. All Royal Navy aircrew wear their wings on the left sleeve of the Number 1 dress uniform jacket, above any rank insignia. =British Army= Army Air Corps Pilot Flying Badge The Army Air Corps pilot wings are awarded upon completion of the basic helicopter course at RAF Shawbury and a subsequent Army course at Middle Wallop Airfield. Aircrew are then dispatched to their OCU to receive type training on either the Apache attack helicopter or the Wildcat battlefield support helicopter. The Army is unique in the British military in that both Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers can become aircrew and aircraft commanders. The wings are identical for both Officers and Other Ranks, and are worn on the left chest above any medals, similar to the RAF. In all the services, award of wings does not confer any operational capability ‚Äì this is declared by a front-line squadron once the student has reached satisfactory standard to allow them to be deployed operationally. This milestone, or 'Combat Ready Status', is the threshold necessary for the award of Flying Pay, a discretionary additional salary bonus for aircrew due to the nature of their work. Australia Royal Australian Air Force loadmaster flying badge Royal Australian Air Force flying badges differ from those in the RAF mainly in having a crown on all Flying Badges (not just on pilot's wings) and in normally having blue wreaths. The pilot's flying badge has the letters \\"RAAF\\". A similar twin-wing badge, bearing the Southern Cross, was introduced for officer aircrew in 1998, replacing various single-wing flying badges previously worn by commissioned officers; however NCO aircrew continue to wear the old single-wing badges. Some RAAF pilots signed a petition in 1998/1999 in protest of non-pilot \\"officer aircrew\\" receiving a double wing. It was rumoured that some serving navigators and war veterans who had previously held the soon to be abolished 'half' wing agreed with the protest. The petition ultimately had over 10,000 signatures, but in the end the petition was unsuccessful. Australian Army flying badges New Zealand New Zealand uses similar insignia to the United Kingdom, except the pilot's wings bear the letters \\"NZ\\" instead of \\"RAF\\" and the single wing of other aircrew still have the letters of the trade they represent. Currently these are air warfare officer and air warfare specialist (both wear AW), air engineer (E), air loadmaster (LM), helicopter loadmaster (HL), flight steward (FS), air ordnanceman (AO), and parachute jump instructor (a parachute). Air electronics operator (AE) and Helicopter crewman (HC) are obsolete.

The Academy offers an associate degree in occupational studies and teaches drama and related arts in the areas of theater, film, and television. Students also have the opportunity to audition for the third-year theater company. Students can usually transfer completed credits to another college or university to finish a bachelor's degree if they choose. History The oldest acting school in the English- speaking world, the Academy in New York City was founded in 1884 by Franklin Haven Sargent, a graduate of Harvard University and professor of speech and elocution at his alma mater.https://www.aada.edu/about/history-and-heritage/ Sargent's vision was to establish a school to train actors for the stage. Its first home was the original Lyceum Theatre on what is now Park Avenue South. In 1963, the school moved to its current home, a landmark building designed by the American Renaissance architect Stanford White for the Colony Club. In 1974, the Academy opened another campus in Pasadena, California, which made it the only professional actor-training school in both major centers of American entertainment. The Los Angeles campus moved from Pasadena to Hollywood in 2001 in a new building next to the site of the former studios of Charlie Chaplin. Academics The Academy remains dedicated to training professional actors. It offers a two-year program in which students have to be invited back for the second year. Auditions are held at the end of the second year for the third- year company. As well as training for the theatre, it now offers courses in film and television, providing a structured, professionally oriented program that stresses self-discovery, self-discipline and individuality. Students who graduate in New York receive an Associate of Occupational Studies degree; students who graduate in Hollywood receive a Certificate of Completion or an Associate of Arts degree in acting. Students from New York and Los Angeles can get a Bachelor of Arts degree from selected universities. Numerous students of the Academy have gone on to careers in the entertainment industry. Alumni of The Academy have been nominated for 110 Oscars, 317 Emmy's and 94 Tony's.

GLIMMER was the first system that used the interpolated Markov model to identify coding regions. The GLIMMER software is open source and is maintained by Steven Salzberg, Art Delcher, and their colleagues at the Center for Computational Biology at Johns Hopkins University. The original GLIMMER algorithms and software were designed by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to bacterial genome annotation in collaboration with Owen White. Versions =GLIMMER 1.0= First Version of GLIMMER \\"i.e., GLIMMER 1.0\\" was released in 1998 and it was published in the paper Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov model. Markov models were used to identify microbial genes in GLIMMER 1.0. GLIMMER considers the local composition sequence dependencies which makes GLIMMER more flexible and more powerful when compared to fixed-order Markov model. There was a comparison made between interpolated Markov model used by GLIMMER and fifth order Markov model in the paper Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov models. \\"GLIMMER algorithm found 1680 genes out of 1717 annotated genes in Haemophilus influenzae where fifth order Markov model found 1574 genes. GLIMMER found 209 additional genes which were not included in 1717 annotated genes where fifth order Markov model found 104 genes.\\"' =GLIMMER 2.0= Second Version of GLIMMER i.e., GLIMMER 2.0 was released in 1999 and it was published in the paper Improved microbial identification with GLIMMER. This paper provides significant technical improvements such as using interpolated context model instead of interpolated Markov model and resolving overlapping genes which improves the accuracy of GLIMMER. Interpolated context models are used instead of interpolated Markov model which gives the flexibility to select any base. In interpolated Markov model probability distribution of a base is determined from the immediate preceding bases. If the immediate preceding base is irrelevant amino acid translation, interpolated Markov model still considers the preceding base to determine the probability of given base where as interpolated context model which was used in GLIMMER 2.0 can ignore irrelevant bases. False positive predictions were increased in GLIMMER 2.0 to reduce the number of false negative predictions. Overlapped genes are also resolved in GLIMMER 2.0. Various comparisons between GLIMMER 1.0 and GLIMMER 2.0 were made in the paper Improved microbial identification with GLIMMER which shows improvement in the later version. \\"Sensitivity of GLIMMER 1.0 ranges from 98.4 to 99.7% with an average of 99.1% where as GLIMMER 2.0 has a sensitivity range from 98.6 to 99.8% with an average of 99.3%. GLIMMER 2.0 is very effective in finding genes of high density. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei, responsible for causing African sleeping sickness is being identified by GLIMMER 2.0\\" =GLIMMER 3.0= Third version of GLIMMER, \\"GLIMMER 3.0\\" was released in 2007 and it was published in the paper Identifying bacterial genes and endosymbiont DNA with Glimmer. This paper describes several major changes made to the GLIMMER system including improved methods to identify coding regions and start codon. Scoring of ORF in GLIMMER 3.0 is done in reverse order i.e., starting from stop codon and moves back towards the start codon. Reverse scanning helps in identifying the coding portion of the gene more accurately which is contained in the context window of IMM. GLIMMER 3.0 also improves the generated training set data by comparing the long-ORF with universal amino acid distribution of widely disparate bacterial genomes.\\"GLIMMER 3.0 has an average long-ORF output of 57% for various organisms where as GLIMMER 2.0 has an average long-ORF output of 39%.\\" GLIMMER 3.0 reduces the rate of false positive predictions which were increased in GLIMMER 2.0 to reduce the number of false negative predictions. \\"GLIMMER 3.0 has a start-site prediction accuracy of 99.5% for 3'5' matches where as GLIMMER 2.0 has 99.1% for 3'5' matches. GLIMMER 3.0 uses a new algorithm for scanning coding regions, a new start site detection module, and architecture which integrates all gene predictions across an entire genome.\\" Minimum description length = Theoretical and Biological Foundation = The GLIMMER project helped introduce and popularize the use of variable length models in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics that subsequently have been applied to numerous problems such as protein classification and others. Variable length modeling was originally pioneered by information theorists and subsequently ingeniously applied and popularized in data compression (e.g. Ziv-Lempel compression). Prediction and compression are intimately linked using Minimum Description Length Principles. The basic idea is to create a dictionary of frequent words (motifs in biological sequences). The intuition is that the frequently occurring motifs are likely to be most predictive and informative. In GLIMMER the interpolated model is a mixture model of the probabilities of these relatively common motifs. Similarly to the development of HMMs in Computational Biology, the authors of GLIMMER were conceptually influenced by the previous application of another variant of interpolated Markov models to speech recognition by researchers such as Fred Jelinek (IBM) and Eric Ristad (Princeton). The learning algorithm in GLIMMER is different from these earlier approaches. Access GLIMMER can be downloaded from The Glimmer home page (requires a C++ compiler). Alternatively, an online version is hosted by NCBI . How it works # GLIMMER primarily searches for long- ORFS. An open reading frame might overlap with any other open reading frame which will be resolved using the technique described in the sub section. Using these long-ORFS and following certain amino acid distribution GLIMMER generates training set data. # Using these training data, GLIMMER trains all the six Markov models of coding DNA from zero to eight order and also train the model for noncoding DNA # GLIMMER tries to calculate the probabilities from the data. Based on the number of observations, GLIMMER determines whether to use fixed order Markov model or interpolated Markov model. ## If the number of observations are greater than 400, GLIMMER uses fixed order Markov model to obtain there probabilities. ## If the number of observations are less than 400, GLIMMER uses interpolated Markov model which is briefly explained in the next sub section. # GLIMMER obtains score for every long-ORF generated using all the six coding DNA models and also using non-coding DNA model. # If the score obtained in the previous step is greater than a certain threshold then GLIMMER predicts it to be a gene. The steps explained above describes the basic functionality of GLIMMER. There are various improvements made to GLIMMER and some of them are described in the following sub-sections. =The GLIMMER system= GLIMMER system consists of two programs. First program called build- imm, which takes an input set of sequences and outputs the interpolated Markov model as follows. The probability for each base i.e., A,C,G,T for all k-mers for 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 8 is computed. Then, for each k-mer, GLIMMER computes weight. New sequence probability is computed as follows. \\\\operatorname{P(SM)=\\\\sum_{x=1}^n{IMM_8(S_x)}} where n is the length of the sequence S_x is the oligomer at position x. IMM_8(S_x) , the 8^{th} -order interpolated Markov model score is computed as \\\\operatorname{IMM_k(S_x)= Y_k(S_{x-1})\\\\cdot P_k(S_x)+[1-{Y_k(S_{x-1})]\\\\cdot IMM_{k-1}(S_x)}} \\"where Y_k(S_{x-1}) is the weight of the k-mer at position x-1 in the sequence S and P_k(S_x) is the estimate obtained from the training data of the probability of the base located at position x in the k^{th} -order model.\\" The probability of base S_x given the i previous bases is computed as follows. \\\\operatorname{P_i(S_x) =P(s_xS_{x,j}) = \\\\frac{f(S_{x,j})}{\\\\sum_{b \\\\in {[acgt]}}\\\\operatorname{f(S_{x,i},b)}}} \\"The value of Y_i(S_{x}) associated with P_i(S_x) can be regarded as a measure of confidence in the accuracy of this value as an estimate of the true probability. GLIMMER uses two criteria to determine Y_i(S_{x}) . The first of these is simple frequency occurrence in which the number of occurrences of context string S_{x,i} in the training data exceeds a specific threshold value, then Y_i(S_{x}) is set to 1.0. The current default value for threshold is 400, which gives 95% confidence. When there are insufficient sample occurrences of a context string, build-imm employ additional criteria to determine Y value. For a given context string S_{x,i} of length i, build-imm compare the observed frequencies of the following base f(S_{x,i}, a) , f(S_{x,i}, c) , f(S_{x,i}, g) , f(S_{x,i}, t) with the previously calculated interpolated Markov model probabilities using the next shorter context, IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, a) , IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, c) , IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, g) , IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, t) . Using a X^2 test, build-imm determine how likely it is that the four observed frequencies are consistent with the IMM values from the next shorter context.\\" The second program called glimmer, then uses this IMM to identify putative gene in an entire genome. GLIMMER identifies all the open reading frame which score higher than threshold and check for overlapping genes. Resolving overlapping genes is explained in the next sub- section. Equations and explanation of the terms used above are taken from the paper 'Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov models =Resolving overlapping genes= In GLIMMER 1.0, when two genes A and B overlap, the overlap region is scored. If A is longer than B, and if A scores higher on the overlap region, and if moving B's start site will not resolve the overlap, then B is rejected. GLIMMER 2.0 provided a better solution to resolve the overlap. In GLIMMER 2.0, when two potential genes A and B overlap, the overlap region is scored. Suppose gene A scores higher, four different orientations are considered. Case 1 In the above case, moving of start sites does not remove the overlap. If A is significantly longer than B, then B is rejected or else both A and B are called genes, with a doubtful overlap. Case 2 In the above case, moving of B can resolve the overlap, A and B can be called non overlapped genes but if B is significantly shorter than A, then B is rejected. Case 3 In the above case, moving of A can resolve the overlap. A is only moved if overlap is a small fraction of A or else B is rejected. Case 4 In the above case, both A and B can be moved. We first move the start of B until the overlap region scores higher for B. Then we move the start of A until it scores higher. Then B again, and so on, until either the overlap is eliminated or no further moves can be made. The above example has been taken from the paper 'Identifying bacterial genes and endosymbiont DNA with Glimmer' =Ribosome binding sites= Ribosome binding site(RBS) signal can be used to find true start site position. GLIMMER results are passed as an input for RBSfinder program to predict ribosome binding sites. GLIMMER 3.0 integrates RBSfinder program into gene predicting function itself. ELPH software( which was determined as highly effective at identifying RBS in the paper) is used for identifying RBS and is available at this website. Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to identify shared motif in any set of sequences. This shared motif sequences and their length is given as input to ELPH. ELPH then computes the position weight matrix(PWM) which will be used by GLIMMER 3 to score any potential RBS found by RBSfinder. The above process is done when we have a substantial amount of training genes. If there are inadequate number of training genes, GLIMMER 3 can bootstrap itself to generate a set of gene predictions which can be used as input to ELPH. ELPH now computes PWM and this PWM can be again used on the same set of genes to get more accurate results for start-sites. This process can be repeated for many iterations to obtain more consistent PWM and gene prediction results. Performance Glimmer supports genome annotation efforts on a wide range of bacterial, archaeal, and viral species. In a large-scale reannotation effort at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ, which mirrors Genbank). Kosuge et al. (2006) examined the gene finding methods used for 183 genomes. They reported that of these projects, Glimmer was the gene finder for 49%, followed by GeneMark with 12%, with other algorithms used in 3% or fewer of the projects. (They also reported that 33% of genomes used \\"other\\" programs, which in many cases meant that they could not identify the method. Excluding those cases, Glimmer was used for 73% of the genomes for which the methods could be unambiguously identified.) Glimmer was used by the DDBJ to re-annotate all bacterial genomes in the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases. It is also being used by this group to annotate viruses. Glimmer is part of the bacterial annotation pipeline at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which also maintains a web server for Glimmer, as do sites in Germany, Canada,.

Nf3 Bg4 The position can also arise from the move order 1.Nf3 d6 2.d4 Bg4. History The opening is named after British IM Bob WadeSee Nigel Davies article showing Wade's own claim of his \\"own defence\\". (1921‚Äì2008), originally from New Zealand, who played it for over 30 years. A number of grandmasters have often played the opening, including Julian Hodgson, Michael Adams, Vlastimil Jansa, and Tony Miles. Jouni Yrj√∂l√§ and Jussi Tella, in their book An Explosive Chess Opening Repertoire for Black, state that the opening: > [...] was played in 1938 by Rudolf Spielmann and used in the 1960s by Stein > and Kavalek among others ... But the towering figure of the line is Julian > Hodgson, who popularized it with many dynamic performances. Among the other > practitioners, the contributions of Miles, Adams, Hickl and Jansa to the > theoretical development of the line are worth mentioning.Yrj√∂l√§ and Tella > (2001), p. 76 In recognition of Hodgson's contributions, the authors refer to the opening as the \\"Hodgson Variation\\" rather than the \\"Wade Defence\\".
