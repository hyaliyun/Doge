Towson University (then Towson State College) acquired it in 1971. The building currently serves as the home of the executive offices of the Department of Athletics. The National Register listing shows it having been built in 1849, but it also says that Rebecca Dorsey Ridgely, wife of Charles Ridgely III, lived there from 1791 to 1812. The listing calls it Greek Revival, but 1791 is well before the Greek Revival period in the United States. Towson University calls it \\"an important example of Italianate–Federal architecture\\". It is a rectangular three story stone structure faced with scored stucco. The front is three bays, with ground floor windows, six over nine, the full height of the front door. The next story is also six over nine, but not as tall, and the top floor windows are the same size as the upper sash of the floor below. The interior is elegant, including acanthus pattern cornices, Italian marble mantels, graceful chandeliers, and a carved mahogany balustrade.

It was a complement to the then-whites-only Kentucky Lake State Park (now Kenlake State Resort Park), which was nearby. It was built by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which went along with the concept of the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine.Allen p.84 The TVA gave the state of Kentucky a nineteen-year lease, and promised to give Kentucky the area when it proved it could support the park. In its time it was dubbed \\"the finest colored vacation site in the South.\\" This sentiment was echoed in a 1952 Kentucky state map. Opened in 1951, Cherokee State Park was the third blacks- only state park and the first such state park in Kentucky and the Southern United States. It was the only blacks-only state park Kentucky had. With a size of , Cherokee State Park had several amenities. These included a 200-person dining hall (1953), docks for fishing and boating, picnicking, a bathhouse for the lake's beach, and a restaurant. There was also twelve cottages (1953) for overnight lodging. It drew visitors from Western Kentucky, Southern Illinois, and Northern Kentucky. Sand often had to be brought in to keep the beach usable, as it was rocky in nature. With the desegregation movements in the 1960s, Cherokee State Park was closed, and its cottages moved to Kenlake. In 1998 the sculling team of nearby Murray State University used the property to highlight its many rewards, but did nothing to note its history. It is now part of Kenlake State Resort Park. Few of the original buildings remain, but there are plans to reopen the area. On January 9, 2009, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A revised version of the score was published in 1929 by Universal Edition. While the composer conducted a first performance of only the first two movements in 1923, the complete work was premiered in the revised version in Oldenburg in 1930, conducted by Johannes Schüler.  History  Berg composed the Three Pieces between 1913 and 1915. Studying with Arnold Schönberg, he had composed mainly lieder such as Altenberg Lieder, and thought about a larger composition, such as a suite or a symphony. He settled with orchestral pieces, and worked on them in Trahütten, Styria, in summer, where his parents-in-law had a country estate. The work was completed on 23 August 1914. Berg dedicated it \\"to my teacher and friend Arnold Schönberg with immeasurable gratitude and love\\", and sent it to Schönberg as a gift for his 40th birthday, on 13 September 1914. In a letter he expanded: \\"I have truly striven to give my best, to follow all your incentives and suggestions, whereby the unforgettable, yea revolutionising experiences of the Amsterdam rehearsals and thorough study of your orchestra pieces served me boundlessly and sharpened my self-criticism more and more.\\" The premiere of the first two pieces was held in Berlin on 5 June 1923 during an Austrian Music Week, conducted by Anton Webern. It was not until 14 April 1930 that the complete composition was played, in its revised form, by the Oldenburger Landesorchester conducted by Johannes Schüler. Structure The three pieces are: ; Präludium (Prelude) :An instrumentally colourful, impressionistic prelude. After a murmuring introduction, an evocative, wide-ranging theme is stated by bassoons and violins, and then fully developed. ; Reigen (Round Dance) :Replete with both waltz music and Ländler music, this piece demonstrates an inherent eclecticism that, as in many of Berg's works, permitted a synthesis of old and new, classical and popular, often infused with grotesquerie. ; Marsch (March) :A sizable and highly imaginative march, notable for its element of chaos and its extremes of orchestration. The score is marked for the possibility of playing the two first movements alone, as at the premiere. When the complete work was premiered, Berg compared the sequence of three movements to a symphony, Reigen taking the position of a Scherzo, and Marsch as a finale. Derrick Puffett suggested that the title may allude to Arthur Schnitzler's play Reigen, of which Berg owned a copy. Adorno wrote about the finale in his 1968 analysis of Berg works, connecting it to Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra and Mahler's Ninth Symphony: Instrumentation The work is scored for: Woodwinds :4 flutes (all doubling piccolo) :4 oboes (4th doubling cor anglais) :4 clarinets in A (3rd doubling clarinet in E) :1 bass clarinet in B :3 bassoons :1 contrabassoon Brass :6 horns in F :4 trumpets in F :4 trombones (1 alto, 2 tenor, 1 bass) :contrabass tuba Percussion : 2 sets of timpani :percussion (4 players) :celesta Strings :2 harps :violins I :violins II :violas :violoncellos :double basses References Sources * Lee, Douglas. \\"Masterworks of 20th Century Music\\", Routledge, 2002. , * Steinberg, Michael.

Burton also had a short career as an actress and later became a newspaper editor with her husband, Victor Morgan. Career Beatrice wanted to be an actress and had even signed a contract with David Belasco in 1909, but little work came her way. One of her most significant roles came in 1922 when she played Mrs. Reed in The Cradle Buster. As a second resort, she began to write at the impressive rate of as many as four books a year. Burton's romance stories were first serialized in newspapers with great success before Grosset and Dunlap published them in low-cost hard-cover editions. As her books made their way to Hollywood, Burton's name became entwined with 1920s pop culture. Her romance stories, which all take place during the year they were written, provide a glimpse into the culture of the '20s. Many famous actors, films, and figures are mentioned during the stories. Also used is the inventive '20s slang. In her time, Burton was known as a woman's author. Donald Willard writes in the Boston Globe from 1927 that Beatrice Burton is among the favorites of young female stenographers, \\"innocent of the world and starry- eyed.\\" He implies the books read by such women have little literary value. Even so, Burton's serials and novels were distributed and read widely, giving her productions \\"a ready made audience in every city and town throughout the country.\\" Burton's writing, and the films adapted from them, were distributed by the Hearst Circulation. The Hearst Media Corporation was a powerful media group that controlled several newspapers, radio stations, and Cosmopolitan Pictures. The circulation was responsible for the advertisement of movies like Sally’s Shoulders.

In this document the Assyrian and Catholic churches confessed the same doctrine concerning Christology (the divinity and humanity of Christ): > The Word of God, second Person of the Holy Trinity, became incarnate by the > power of the Holy Spirit in assuming from the holy Virgin Mary a body > animated by a rational soul, with which he was indissolubly united from the > moment of his conception. Therefore our Lord Jesus Christ is true God and > true man, perfect in his divinity and perfect in his humanity, > consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us in all things but > sin. His divinity and his humanity are united in one person, without > confusion or change, without division or separation. In him has been > preserved the difference of the natures of divinity and humanity, with all > their properties, faculties and operations. But far from constituting \\"one > and another\\", the divinity and humanity are united in the person of the same > and unique Son of God and Lord Jesus Christ, who is the object of a single > adoration. Christ therefore is not an \\"ordinary man\\" whom God adopted in > order to reside in him and inspire him, as in the righteous ones and the > prophets. But the same God the Word, begotten of his Father before all > worlds without beginning according to his divinity, was born of a mother > without a father in the last times according to his humanity. They went on to explain each other's formulations of titles for Mary the mother of Jesus, the key to the dispute at the First Council of Ephesus about Nestorianism and the title Theotokos: > The humanity to which the Blessed Virgin Mary gave birth always was that of > the Son of God himself. That is the reason why the Assyrian Church of the > East is praying [to] the Virgin Mary as \\"the Mother of Christ our God and > Saviour\\". In the light of this same faith the Catholic tradition addresses > the Virgin Mary as \\"the Mother of God\\" and also as \\"the Mother of Christ\\". They then recognised each other's formulations as being valid: > We both recognize the legitimacy and rightness of these expressions of the > same faith and we both respect the preference of each Church in her > liturgical life and piety. The declaration went on to create a mixed committee for further theological dialogue between the two (now sister) churches. In 2001 this committee drew up guidelines for mutual admission to the eucharist between the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East, overcoming the issue of the lack of words of Institution in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari.

Cotton became a national \\"name\\" with a retrospective and touring exhibition 50 years later in 1985. A book of her life and work, published by the National Library of Australia, came out in 1995. Cotton captured her childhood friend Max Dupain from the sidelines at photoshoots, e.g. \\"Fashion shot, Cronulla Sandhills, circa 1937\\" and made several portraits of him.Olive Cotton: Photographer, Helen Ennis, National Library of Australia, 1995. Dupain was Cotton's first husband. The prestigious Olive Cotton Award for Photographic Portraiture was set up in her honour and funded by Cotton's family and held at the Tweed regional gallery in New South Wales. Early life Olive Edith Cotton was born on 11 July 1911, the eldest child in an artistic, intellectual family. Her parents, Leo and Florence (née Channon) provided a musical background along with political and social awareness. Her mother was a painter and pianist while Leo was a geologist, who took photographs on Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition to the Antarctic in 1907. The Cotton family and their five children lived in the then bushland suburb of Hornsby in Sydney's north. An uncle, Frank Cotton was a professor of physiologySydney Morning Herald obituary for brother, Frank Cotton and wife Marie, by Tony Stephens, 31 July 2008 and her grandfather, also Frank Cotton, was a Member of Parliament in the first Labor Caucus. Given a Kodak No.0 Box Brownie camera at the age of 11, Cotton with the help of her father made the home laundry into a darkroom \\"with the enlarger plugged into the ironing light\\". Here Cotton processed film and printed her first black and white images. While on holidays with her family at Newport Beach in 1924, Cotton met Max Dupain and they became friends, sharing a passion for photography. The photograph \\"She-oaks\\" (1928) was taken at Bungan Beach headland in this period. Cotton attended the Methodist Ladies' College, Burwood in Sydney from 1921 to 1929, gained a scholarship and went on to complete a B.A. at the University of Sydney in 1933, majoring in English and Mathematics; she also studied music and was an accomplished pianist with a particular fondness for Chopin's Nocturnes. Photography Cotton joined The Sydney Camera Circle and the Photographic Society of New South Wales, gaining instruction and encouragement from important photographers such as Harold Cazneaux. She exhibited her first photograph, \\"Dusk\\", at the New South Wales Photographic Society's Interstate Exhibition of 1932. She exhibited quite frequently, her photography was personal in feeling with an appreciation of certain qualities of light in the surroundings. After university she pursued photography by joining Dupain at his new studio, 24 Bond Street, Sydney. Her contemporaries included Damien Parer, Geoff Powell, the model Jean Lorraine and photographer Olga Sharpe, who frequented the studio. In Australia during the 1930s clients assumed a man would be the photographer. Cotton wryly referred to herself as \\"the assistant\\". However whenever possible Cotton photographed visiting celebrities or interesting objects in the studio, even capturing Dupain working in her piece, \\"Fashion shot, Cronulla Sandhills, circa 1937\\" and made portraits of him. The publisher Sydney Ure Smith gave her many commissions, and regarded her as one of the best photographers of the 1930s and 1940s. During the 1930s Cotton developed mastery using the 'Pictorial' style of photography popular at the time and also incorporated a very modern style approach. The Commonwealth Bank's staff magazine Bank Notes featured Cotton's more non-commercial photographs as illustrations. =Signature photographs= Tea cup ballet (1935) was photographed in the studio after Cotton had bought some inexpensive china from Woolworth's to replace the old chipped studio crockery. In it she used a technique of back of the lighting to cast bold shadows towards the viewer to express a dance theme between the shapes of the tea cups, their saucers and their shadows. It was exhibited locally at the time and in the London Salon of Photography in 1935. It has become Cotton's signature image and was acknowledged on a stamp commemorating 150 years of photography in Australia in 1991. Tea cup ballet features on the cover of the book Olive Cotton: Photographer published by the National Library of Australia in 1995. Shasta Daisies (1937) and The Budapest String Quartet (c. 1937) were included in the Victorian Salon of Photography exhibition of 1937. In 1939 Cotton married her longtime friend Max Dupain. They separated in 1941 and were divorced in 1944.Design and Art Australia Online. Retrieved 24 April 2014 Cotton received numerous commissions in 1945, including photographs of winter and spring flowers for Helen Blaxland's book Flowerpieces, which also included some images by Dupain. Sydney Ure Smith was an advocate of her work, and she did many commissions for his various art publications. In mid-1947 Cotton went to live in the bush 35 km from Cowra, New South Wales, with her new husband Ross McInerney. They lived in a tent for the first three years, then moving to a small farm where their two children grew up. She taught Mathematics at Cowra High School for five years until 1964 when she opened a small photographic studio in the town, taking many portraits, wedding photographs, etc., for people in the surrounding district, where her work became well-known and much appreciated, although she was as yet unknown on the postwar city art scene until 1985. Exhibitions Among others, her work was shown in the following exhibitions: *1938 Commemorative Salon of Photography exhibition held by the Photographic Society of NSW as part of the Australian 150th anniversary celebrations. *1938 Group show with the Contemporary Camera Groupe at David Jones Gallery, Sydney. *1981 Australian Women Photographers 1890-1950 touring exhibition, curated by Jenni Mather, Christine Gillespie and Barbara Hall. *1985 Olive Cotton Photographs 1924-1984 retrospective held at the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney, touring numerous regional galleries in NSW, Victoria and Queensland throughout 1986.

The script was written by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, adapted from the 1996 novel Push by Sapphire. The film stars Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, and Mariah Carey. This film marked the acting debut of Sidibe, who portrays a young woman struggling against poverty and abuse. The film, then without a distributor, premiered to acclaim at both the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, under its original title of Push: Based on the Novel by Sapphire. At Sundance, it won the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize for best drama, as well as a Special Jury Prize for supporting actress Mo'Nique. After Precious' screening at Sundance in January 2009, Tyler Perry announced that he and Oprah Winfrey would be providing promotional assistance to the film, which was released through Lionsgate Entertainment. Precious won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. The film's title was changed from Push to Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, to avoid confusion with the 2009 action film Push. Precious was also an official selection at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival (particularly the un certain regard section). Lionsgate gave the film a limited release in North America on November 6, 2009, with an expanded release on November 20. Precious received largely positive reviews from critics; the performances of Sidibe and Mo'Nique, the story, and its message were highly praised. The film was a box office success, earning over $63 million on a $10 million budget. Precious received six nominations at the 82nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Daniels, and Best Actress for Sidibe. Mo'Nique won the award for Best Supporting Actress, while Geoffrey Fletcher won for Best Adapted Screenplay, becoming the first African-American to win a screenplay award at the Oscars. Plot In 1987, 16-year-old Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) lives in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City with her unemployed mother Mary (Mo'Nique), who has long subjected her to physical, verbal, and sexual abuse. Precious has also been raped by her now-absent father, Carl (Rodney \\"Bear\\" Jackson), resulting in two pregnancies. The family resides in a Section 8 tenement and survives on welfare. Her first child, daughter Mongo (short for Mongoloid), has Down syndrome and is being cared for by Precious' grandmother, though Mary forces the family to pretend that Mongo lives with her and Precious so she can receive extra money from the government. When Precious' second pregnancy is discovered, her high-school principal arranges for her to attend an alternative school, where she hopes Precious can change her life's direction. Precious finds a way out of her traumatic daily life by escaping into daydreams in which she is loved and appreciated. Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally learns to read and write. She meets sporadically with a new social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about the sexual assault in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness, and develops a crush on him. Upon returning home, Mary asks to hold Abdul. When Precious's back is turned, her mother purposely drops baby Abdul on the ground and attacks her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the abuse has resulted in them being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away with Abdul, while Mary tries to drop the television set on them; she eventually breaks into her school classroom for shelter. When Ms. Rain discovers them the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious and Abdul to live in, but they end up staying with Ms. Rain and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Ms. Rain takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them; Precious will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house. Mary soon returns to inform Precious of her father's death from AIDS. Precious later learns that she is HIV-positive, even though Abdul is not. Feeling dejected, she steals her case file from Ms. Weiss's office. As she shares the details of her file with her fellow students, she begins to hope for the future. Later, Precious meets with her mother, who brings Mongo, at Ms. Weiss's office. Ms. Weiss confronts Mary about her and Carl's abuse of Precious, going back to when Precious was a toddler. Mary tearfully confesses that she's always hated Precious for \\"stealing her man\\" by \\"letting him\\" abuse her, and for eventually \\"making him leave.\\" Precious tells Mary that she finally sees her for what she really is, and tells her mother that she will never see her or the children ever again, leaving with both Mongo and Abdul. Mary begs Ms. Weiss to retrieve her daughter and her grandchildren, but Ms. Weiss silently rejects her and walks away, leaving a distraught Mary alone in the room. Precious plans to complete a GED test to receive a high-school diploma equivalency. She walks out into the city with both children in tow, ready to start a new life and have a brighter future.  Cast  Gabourey Sidibe in 2014 *Gabourey Sidibe as Claireece Precious Jones. The film's casting director, Billy Hopkins, found her at an open-call audition held at New York City's Lehman College. Sidibe was chosen over 300 others who auditioned in nationwide casting calls and had no prior acting experience. *Mo'Nique as Mary Lee Johnston, Precious's abusive and unemployed mother. Mo'Nique and Daniels had previously worked together in Shadowboxer (in which her character was named Precious). In the end, she reveals she hates Precious for \\"taking her man.\\" *Paula Patton as Ms. Blu Rain, Precious's alternative- school teacher. Patton said that her character teaches Precious to \\"learn and read and write from the very beginnings, and pushes her to believe in herself, and pushes her to realize that anything is possible.\\" *Mariah Carey as Ms. Weiss, Precious's social worker who supports her during her struggles. In September 2008, Carey described her character as \\"not really a likable person, but she does bring this to the surface.\\" Carey and Daniels had previously worked together on Tennessee. Daniels said that he cast Carey because he was \\"so impressed\\" by her performance in Tennessee. According to director Daniels, Helen Mirren, who starred in his previous film Shadowboxer, was originally set to play the part of Ms. Weiss, but obtained a role in a \\"bigger project.\\" (audio commentary) *Lenny Kravitz as Nurse John McFadden, a nurse who shows kindness to Precious. This film is Kravitz' feature film acting debut. *Sherri Shepherd as Lisa *Barret Helms (as Barret Isaiah Mindell) as Tom Cruise, Precious's imaginary boyfriend. *Nealla Gordon as Mrs. Sondra Lichtenstein *Stephanie Andujar as Rita Romero, a 16-year-old former heroin addict and prostitute, who attends the same alternative school in Harlem as Precious and later befriends her. During Andujar's audition, Daniels was so impressed that he interrupted her dialogue and stated, \\"I want you in my movie.\\" *Chyna Layne as Rhonda Patrice Johnson *Amina Robinson as Jermaine Hicks *Xosha Roquemore as Jo Ann *Aunt Dot as Toosie, Mary's mother and Precious's grandmother.

Taylor as the Unknown character in the film. At the beginning of the film, she's walking to Precious wearing an orange gown and hands Precious an orange scarf. Production Daniels had said that he was attracted to the initial novel based on how \\"raw and honest\\" it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident was the first time he saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating \\"she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her — that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do.\\" In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that \\"maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too.\\" Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest. The film was co-produced by Daniels's company, Lee Daniels Entertainment, and the Sarah Siegel-Magness and Gary Magness-owned Smokewood Entertainment Group. The two production companies had previously collaborated with Daniels on Tennessee (2008). Precious had, in total, thirteen producers: Daniels, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Heller, Tyler Perry, Lisa Cortes, Gary Magness, Valerie Hoffman, Asger Hussain, Mark G. Mathis, Andrew Sforzini, Bergen Swason, Simone Sheffield and Sarah Siegel-Magness. Initially, Daniels did not expect the movie to generate much buzz, expecting the movie to go straight to video, stating \\"That it made it to the big screen says there was an angel looking after me.\\" Principal photography (filming) for the film took place on location in various parts of New York City. Despite the dark subject matter, Sidibe has stated that the mood on the set was lighthearted, that \\"Every day was a party\\" and that the cast would frequently sing and tell jokes to \\"lighten the atmosphere.\\" The production budget was $10 million. After Precious was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival in January, it was picked up for distribution by Lions Gate Entertainment and received promotional assistance from Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Tyler Perry's 34th Street Films. Precious was the first theatrical film to be affiliated with Perry's company. In February 2009, Lionsgate and The Weinstein Company filed lawsuits contesting ownership of the rights to release Precious. Both companies claim that they had purchased distribution rights to Precious: The Weinstein Company claimed that they had \\"secured\\" their rights while Lionsgate stated that they owned the rights to the film's distribution in North America. Precious sales agent Cinetic Media denied Weinstein's claims, stating that they failed to finalize the deal. Music Lionsgate, in association with Matriarch/Geffen Records released the soundtrack online as a digital download on November 3, 2009, and in stores on November 23. Daniels confirmed that Mary J. Blige's \\"I Can See in Color\\" song will be released as a single from the soundtrack. The song was written by Blige, Raphael Saadiq and LaNeah Menzies and is produced by Raphael Saadiq. The soundtrack consists of various artists (Labelle, Donna Allen, Jean Carn, Sunny Gale, and MFSB); with some artists having recorded songs that were covers and other songs that were recorded specifically for the album. The album received positive praise; mainly the song \\"I Can See In Color\\" – which was released as a single – that was recorded and co-written by Blige. The trailer features the song \\"Destiny\\" taken from Blige's 2001 album No More Drama. A song titled \\"My Good Lovin' (Back Like That Remix)\\", featuring Da Brat and Lil' Mo, was featured in the film but exempted from the soundtrack. Composer Robin Thicke, then married to the film's costar Paula Patton, wrote and produced \\"Push\\", the film's original main theme music. Later announcements confirmed that the song would be replaced by Mary J. Blige's \\"I Can See In Color\\". Leona Lewis' song, \\"Happy\\" (from her album Echo) is featured in the film's trailer. Daniels stated that the artists featured on the film's soundtrack were selected because they \\"resonate not only in Precious's world, but speak to your soul no matter who you are.\\" Two other songs, performed decades earlier by Queen Latifah and Mahalia Jackson, were also chosen for the film's soundtrack. The soundtrack features LaBelle (Nona Hendryx, Sarah Dash, and Patti LaBelle), Donna Allen, Jean Carn, Sunny Gale, and MFSB. People Magazine Daily noted that the film \\"mainly had a music supervised soundtrack, but not much of a score, so there were popular songs placed in the movie.\\" Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone, described \\"I Can See In Color\\" as being \\"a knockout song...expressing the goal of Precious to see the world in color.\\" =Track listing= =Reception= Rolling Stone praised the album, and described the song, \\"I Can See In Color\\" as being \\"...a knockout song...expressing the goal of Precious to see the world in color.\\" Allmusic a majority of the album and its artists. Allmusic described the album as featuring \\"solid offerings from both contemporary and classic\\", crediting the contributions from Latifah, Hightower, Jackson and LaBelle, and stated that the album resulted \\"in a solid and empowering collection that (in the words of [the film's director Lee] Daniels) \\"resonate not only in Precious' world, but speak to your soul no matter who you are.\\" Release =Marketing= The film's director, Lee Daniels, said that he was, at first, \\"embarrassed\\" to screen Precious at the Cannes Film Festival because he felt that it would show African-Americans in a negative light, due to its content. Precious was screened during the 2009 Sundance Film Festival from January 15, 2009, until January 25 in Park City, Utah. At Sundance, Precious was listed under its original title of Push: Based On The Novel By Sapphire; however, the title was later altered to avoid confusion with another 2009 film entitled Push. Precious appeared in the Un Certain Regard, an award section recognising unique and innovative films, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in May 2009. At Cannes, the film received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience after the film was screened. Daniels commented that, at first he was \\"embarrassed\\" to show Precious at Cannes because he did not want \\"to exploit black people\\" and wasn't sure if he \\"wanted white French people to see our world\\". After the success at Precious' screenings at Sundance, reporters took note that the film could mirror the success of other films that had been screened and praised at the festival. S. James Snyder, of Time, compared Precious's success at Sundance to that of 2008's The Wrestler and Slumdog Millionaire; both films later were nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and Slumdog itself won Best Picture at the 81st Annual Academy Awards. Winfrey used her status as both a celebrity and a media personality to give the film what was described by Ben Child of The Guardian, as a \\"high-profile promotional push.\\" At a press conference Winfrey announced her intention to lead a promotional campaign on behalf of Precious along with her other various platforms, hoping to be able to \\"bring in different audiences\\" by promoting the film on her show, in her magazine and on her satellite-radio channel. Katie Walmsley of CNN remarked, based on the film's positive reception at the Toronto Film Festival, that the film \\"at the very least, the [Toronto] award will guarantee \\"Precious\\" substantial distribution, as well as exposure for two-time director Daniels.\\" The trailer for Precious was shown during previews of the film's producer Perry's film I Can Do Bad All By Myself in September 2009. =Box office= Precious was given a limited-theatrical release on November 6, 2009, and was originally scheduled to appear on screens only in North America. During its opening weekend, the film earned $1,872,458, which placed twelfth on that weekend's box office list, despite being in only 18 theaters. The film saw a 214 percent increase in its second week of release, earning $5,874,628 at 174 theaters, which catapulted it up to third place in that weekend's box office, with a per-theater average of $33,762. On November 20, 2009, the film received a wider release, showing at 629 theaters (thus tripling the number of theaters showing the film). In its third week, Precious, as studios had previously estimated, placed sixth at the box office, with the revenues estimated $11,008,000an 87.4% increase from the previous week. After riding that three-week wave of success, Precious began to see a decrease in box office earnings. However, the film holds the record as the highest grossing picture to open in fewer than 100 theaters, and holds the record for the highest grossing average per screen for films shown in fewer than 50 theaters. Brandon Grey of Box Office Mojo described Precious as having had a \\"robust expansion\\" in its second week of release, and he confirmed that the film holds the record for having the second-highest grossing weekend for a movie playing at fewer than 200 sites, behind only Paranormal Activity. Precious grossed a total of $40,320,285 in over six weeks of release. The film opened at ninth place in the United Kingdom, with revenues totaling £259,000 in its opening weekend from a limited release of 47 cinemas, generating a £5,552 screen average. =Home media= The film was released on DVD-Video and Blu-ray Disc formats on March 9, 2010, reaching number one on the top DVD sales chart in the United States with 1.5 million DVDs sold in its first week of release. It also reached the top position on the rental charts for iTunes and Amazon.com. Reception =Critical response= Golden Globe, a SAG Award, a BAFTA and an Oscar. Precious received favorable reviews from film critics, particularly for Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's performances. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of 236 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.82/10. The site's consensus is that \\"Precious is a grim yet ultimately triumphant film about abuse and inner- city life, largely bolstered by exceptional performances from its cast.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, gave the film a rating score of 79 based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews.\\" John Anderson of Variety said \\"to simply call it harrowing or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it,\\" having felt that the film is \\"courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope.\\" Anderson cited Carey's performance as \\"pitch perfect\\" and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as \\"disarming.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been \\"an authentically deglammed compassion\\" and praised the film for capturing \\"how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead\\" and for Daniels' showing \\"unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in the closets of some impoverished inner-city lives.\\" Gleiberman described the film as being a movie \\"that makes you think, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul\\", and felt that the \\"final scene of revelation\\" between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers \\"tearful, shaken, [and] dazed with pity and terror.\\" He identified how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final \\"push\\" needed by Sidibe: \\"The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Mo'Nique and Sidibe's performances. Ebert described Mo'Nique's performance as being \\"frighteningly convincing\\" and felt that \\"the film is a tribute to Sidibe's ability to engage our empathy\\" because she \\"completely creates the Precious character.\\" He noted that Carey and Patton \\"are equal with Sidibe in screen impact.\\" Ebert praised Daniels because, rather than casting the actors for their names, \\"he was able to see beneath the surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right.\\" Betsey Sharkey, of the Los Angeles Times described the film as being a \\"rough-cut diamond... [A] rare blend of pure entertainment and dark social commentary, it is a shockingly raw, surprisingly irreverent and absolutely unforgettable story.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said that while there are \\"melodramatic moments\\" in the film, the cast gives \\"remarkable performances\\" to show audiences the film's \\"inspiring message.\\" Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone called Mo'Nique \\"dynamite,\\" a performance that \\"tears at your heart.\\" Mary Pols of Time praised the film's fantasy sequences for being able to show the audience a \\"joyous Wizard of Oz energy\\" that is able to \\"open the door into Precious's mind in a way even [the author] Sapphire couldn't.\\" Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has \\"a lack of compelling emotional material\\" but that the film's \\"few weak moments\\" are the \\"ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories.\\" Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post praised the film as being \\"a film that doesn't shy away from the depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments.\\" Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when you put the \\"glaring issues aside,\\" the film \\"still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America.\\" But while the film \\"succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece.\\" Mendelson described the film as being \\"an acting powerhouse\\" based on its many emotional themes. Critic Jack Mathews wrote: \\"Without being familiar with the source material, you really have no idea how much work went into the adaptation or how well it was done.... 'Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire'... First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher did yeoman's work turning Sapphire's graphic, idiomatic novel into a coherent and inspiring story about the journey of an abused Harlem teenager.\\" Erin Aubry Kaplan wrote on Salon.com that the question posed by the film is how to assess the \\"hopeless story of a ghetto teen... in the Age of Obama.\\" She went on to say that \\"'Precious' proves you don't always have to choose between artistic and commercial success; the film's first opening weekend was record-breaking. It's a sign how much we needed to tell this story. And, perhaps, how many stories there are left to tell.\\" A. O. Scott identified the script's precise use of force and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a \\"risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious's life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. 'These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance.\\" Conversely, reflecting the transformation from script to screen, Dana Stevens of Slate disagreed with Gleiberman's suggestion that the \\"film makes you think\\" and argued that the film's \\"eagerness\\" to \\"drag\\" the audience \\"through the lower depths of human experience\\" leaves little space for independent \\"conclusions\\". Stevens noted that, while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, \\"it wields an awfully large cudgel\\", in contrast to Scott's view of balance: \\"unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)\\". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of Push, Stevens' observed that \\"Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city.\\" Precious also received some negative responses from critics. Writing for the New York Press, Armond White compared the film to the landmark but controversial The Birth of a Nation (1915) as \\"demeaning the idea of black American life,\\" calling it \\"an orgy of prurience\\" and the \\"con job of the year.\\"Armond White, Pride and Precious . In the New York Press, November 4, 2009, page found December 30, 2010. He further characterized the source novel as a relic of 1990s identity politics and noted that the film \\"casts light- skinned actors as kind [...] and dark-skinned actors as terrors.\\" In two separate articles, writers for The New York Times cited White's article as the most powerful negative review of Precious, adding that in a recent interview he had remarked that the film's popularity is a result of the \\"fact\\" that \\"black pathology sells.\\" Courtland Milloy, of The Washington Post said Precious was \\"a film of prurient interest that has about as much redeeming social value as a porn flick.\\" David Edelstein, of New York Magazine commented that, while the film has \\"elements\\" that are \\"powerful and shocking,\\" he felt the movie was \\"programmed\\", and that the film had \\"its own study guide.\\" Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York felt that the film did not live up to its \\"long hype\\", and felt that it was \\"bewildering\\" to discover the film's praise at the Sundance Film Festival, because Uhlich characterized the film as having \\"shrug-worthiness.\\" Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian that the film catalogues a \\"horrendous, unending nightmare of abuse\\" and then abruptly turns into something resembling the 1980s musical Fame. Bradshaw commended the film's acting and energy, but said it was not quite the \\"transcendent masterpiece\\" some had made it out to be. Sukhdev Sandhu wrote in The Daily Telegraph that he found the film \\"a dispiriting mix of cliché and melodrama,\\" although he acknowledged that Precious does feature some superb acting. Noting Daniels' admiration of the work of John Waters and Pedro Almodóvar and the joking attitude he and the actors sometimes took towards their material while making the movie, Jim Emerson argued that Precious is best understood as a deliberately over-the-top piece of camp in the vein of Waters's Female Trouble. =Accolades= Precious received dozens of nominations in award categories, including six Academy Award nominations, not only for the film itself but for the cast's performances, the direction and cinematography, and the adaptation of the novel to the screenplay. Director Lee Daniels won the People's Choice Award, an award given by audience members at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Daniels won both awards for which he was nominated at the San Sebastián International Film Festival—the TVE Otra Mirada Award and the Audience Award. He was also nominated in the category of Bronze Horse at the Stockholm Film Festival, and won the Best Feature Film Award at the Hawaii International Film Festival. Precious received five awards at the 2009 Independent Spirit Awards (ISA) in the categories for Best Film, Best First Screenplay, Best Direction, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. Precious received nominations from the 67th Annual Golden Globes for the film and for the performances of Mo'Nique and Sidibe; Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress. The film was nominated in all three major categories at the 2009 Screen Actor Guild Awards: Best Cast, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress (in which Mo'Nique won). Precious was considered for the BAFTA awards in several categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Leading Actress (Sidibe), and Best Supporting Actress (Mo'Nique). On February 2, 2010, the film received Academy Award nominations at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress (Sidibe), Best Supporting Actress (Mo'Nique), Best Director (Daniels), Best Adapted Screenplay (Fletcher), and Best Film Editing (Klotz).

History According to Hallpike (1972), Konso family traditions indicate that they are a composite people, both physically and culturally, with members originally hailing from all the surrounding areas. In terms of physical appearance, the Konso tend to be small and wiry, with high cheekbones and pointed chins. Skin color ranges from reddish brown to almost black, but is dark brown on average. Some individuals more closely resemble the Oromo, possessing thin lips and greater stature; others have a distinctly more 'africoid' phenotype and are much shorter. According to Hallpike (1972), the latter somatic characteristics are more marked amongst Konso women. George Murdock (1959) attributes the pronounced 'negroid' influence on the Konso in general to early inter-mixture with the agricultural pre-Nilotes, who entered the Ethiopian highlands about 5000 years ago. Boy playing ball in front of a Konso stone house Distribution The Konso mainly reside in Ethiopia's Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region, south of Lake Chamo in the Sagan River bend. Many are concentrated in the Konso Zone. Their territory is adjacent to Omotic, Sidama and Oromo communities. Konso typically live in large towns, each governed by a council of elders. A few can also be found in parts of northern Kenya. Language The Konso speak the Konso language (also known as affa xonso) as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afro- Asiatic family. Konso is divided into four dialects: Kholme, Duuro, Fasha and Karatti. It shares a close lexical similarity with Dirasha, and is today transcribed using the Ethiopic script. Demographics According to the 2007 Ethiopian national census, the Konso numbered 250,430 individuals, of whom 10,470 or 4.18% are urban dwellers. Over 87% live in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region.Ethiopia - Census 2007 , first draft, Table 5. Genetics Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the Konso people. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Konso. =Autosomal DNA= The Konso's autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, the Konso showed significant Afro-Asiatic affinities. They also shared some ties with neighboring Nilo-Saharan and Bantu speakers in the Great Lakes region due to considerable genetic exchanges with these communities over the past 5000 or so years.; Also see Supplementary Data: \\"Nilo-Saharan and Cushitic speakers from the Sudan, Kenya, and Tanzania, as well as some of the Bantu speakers from Kenya, Tanzania, and also Rwanda (Hutu/Tutsi), constitute another cluster (purple), reflecting linguistic evidence for gene flow among these populations over the past ~5000 years (28, 29).\\" Culture A waga (grave marker) near the town of Konso Although there are today marked differences in customs between the Konso and their Oromo neighbors, Konso society has also retained some commonalities with traditional Oromo culture. The latter include the gadaa generation-grading system of social organization, similar high priests and a cult of phallicism. Konso society is largely agricultural and involves the irrigation and terracing of mountain slopes. Staple crops include sorghum and corn, with cash crops including cotton and coffee. Cattle, sheep, and goats are raised for food and milk. Polygyny is an accepted practice among the Konso. Group members also erect carvings (wagas), which are created in memory of a dead man who has killed an enemy or animal. The statues are often arranged in groups, with statues representing the man, his wives, and his adversaries present. Religion In terms of creed, the Konso practice a traditional religion centered on the worship of Waaq/Wakh. In the related Oromo culture, Waaq denotes the god of the early faith believed to have been adhered to by Cushitic groups.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Publishing Group: 2001), p.65. alt=peaceful demonestration in Peaceful demonstration in Karat town Notes References * Further reading * Elizabeth E.

Construction on the massive facilities required by GPI began on July 10, 1944, and continued for seven months, finally ending on January 30, 1945. The total cost for the development and construction of GPI was around $1.3 million.Regis, Ed. The Biology of Doom, p. 95. When World War II ended in 1945 GPI was deactivated and closed. Mission =Overview= GPI was the U.S. bio-weapons program's main testing site. Granite Peak was a sub-installation of Dugway Proving Ground and many of GPI's administrative task were overseen by the post commander at Dugway. Personnel stationed at the main Dugway grounds cooperated with tests at GPI. For example, air missions were flown by Dugway detachments, and weather forecast data was also provided by personnel at Dugway. Despite the assistance from Dugway, GPI maintained control over all technical aspects of its operations and testing. GPI was overseen by the Special Projects Division,Guillemin, Jeanne.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 8, 2009. In the episode, Peter becomes temporarily gay after participating in a medical drug test. The episode was written by Richard Appel and directed by series regular Brian Iles. Seth Rogen provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the \\"Seth Rogen gene\\" and Meredith Baxter provided a guest voice as herself. It received divided reviews from television sources and critics, in addition to receiving criticism from the Parents Television Council. \\"Family Gay\\", along with two other episodes, was nominated in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category for the 2009 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Plot While on his way to buy groceries, Peter instead buys a brain-damaged horse, which not only disturbs everyone but also causes $100,000 worth of damage when Peter enters it in a race and it goes on a rampage. Though the horse ends up dying of a fatal heart attack and Peter disposes of the body by flinging it into Mort Goldman's, the Griffins are in debt for initial damages. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of medical drug testing including one that makes him gay. Lois is initially upset that Peter is now gay, but she warms up to the change when he begins exhibiting stereotypical gay behaviors like shopping for clothes and cooking muffins, only to reconsider her stance when Peter rejects her sexual advances. Upon learning that the effects of the gay gene may be permanent, she decides to make the best of things when Peter suddenly leaves her for a gay man named Scott. Seeing Lois heartbroken and depressed, Stewie Griffin and Brian Griffin (who is hesitant due to his support of gay rights) attempt to bring Peter back to his normal self by kidnapping him and sending him to a straight camp for conversion therapy. When Scott comes over looking for Peter, Brian admits his actions. Lois states that she is willing to accept Peter the way he is now and takes him out of the straight camp, telling him to go back to Scott. However, the effects of the experimental gay gene are revealed to be temporary and the effects wear off right when Peter is in the middle of a gay orgy with Scott and nine other men. Peter returns to Lois, and they decide to never speak of the incident again. The episode ends when Mort throws the horse through the Griffin's living room window yelling, \\"Take back your fucking horse!\\" Production \\"Family Gay\\" was executive producer Richard Appel's first writing credit during his time on Family Guy. \\"Family Gay\\" was written by at the time Executive Producer and future co-creator of the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, Richard Appel. This episode being his first and to date his only writing credit on the show. John Viener worked as the executive story editor for the episode. MacFarlane found a list of plot ideas from the third season that says \\"Peter goes gay\\" and he decided to make an episode with that premise. The writers originally wanted to take \\"the high road\\" with the episode. In the first draft, Peter's homosexuality was so subtle, that he just appeared a little more refined. When the writers could not come up with any high road jokes, they \\"went with what they know\\". The writers had fun \\"gaying up the episode\\" by including Peter in a different outfit during every scene after he turned gay. The writers wanted to further the idea that sexuality is inborn, not chosen. The episode was directed by Brian Iles. He was assisted by James Purdum and Peter Shin worked as the supervising directors for the episode. Other crew members that collaborated in the animation of the episode included Deborah Cone who directed the retake of the episode and Kenji Ono who was the assistant director of the episode. Iles sketched out several clothing ideas for Peter to wear. He got ideas by flipping through catalogs. The name of all the horses at the race track are named after canceled Fox shows from May 2005 until this episode aired. It is a tribute to a similar mentioning of canceled shows when Family Guy came back on the air in May 2005 in the episode \\"North by North Quahog\\". When the episode got close to airing, MacFarlane kept thinking they should remove the cutaway gag with Matt Damon, due to MacFarlane liking Damon's criticism of Sarah Palin. \\"Family Gay\\", along with the first eight episodes of the seventh season were released on DVD by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on June 16, 2009, one month after it had completed broadcast on television. The \\"Volume 7\\" DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, animatics, and commentaries for every episode. The DVD also includes four special features those being, Take me out to place tonight; Family Guy Cribz; Comic-Con 2008 Family Guy panel and the Family Guy Art Show. All the main Family Guy cast members lent their voices to the episode, along with writers Kirker Butler, John Viener, Alec Sulkin, Mark Hentemann, and Danny Smith, who all had minor speaking roles. Peter's boyfriend Scott was voiced by recurring voice actor John G. Brennan, who voices him in the same way he voices gay The Jerky Boys character Jack Tors. Other guest stars included writer Wellesley Wild, actress Meredith Baxter-Birney, and actor Seth Rogen. Cultural references The episode begins with Peter playing the 1983 video game Dragon's Lair. Later in the episode, Peter names his horse \\"Till' Death\\", in reference to the show of the same name, highlighting shows that were all cancelled by Fox, including Arrested Development and The War at Home, amongst others. Peter also learns about a pomegranate martini from InStyle magazine. \\"Family Gay\\" references, in a cutaway, James Bond's iconic ability to persuade women to have sex with him despite their initial resistance. Peter and Brian watch the movie Wild Hogs, which Peter predicts will suck. The western spoof film Blazing Saddles is referenced when Peter and the other men are dancing and singing, \\"The French Mistake\\". \\"Family Gay\\" makes two references to musicals. While in the doctor's office, Peter's doctor makes a reference to the song \\"Seasons of Love\\" from the musical Rent and while reading Flowers in the Attic by V. C. Andrews Peter listens to the song \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" from the musical The Sound of Music, sung by Charmian Carr. Reception Show creator Seth MacFarlane submitted \\"Family Gay\\" along with \\"alt=A man with short black hair and a black shirt in front of a microphone. His arms are crossed, and he is laughing. The episode received a 4.2/6 Nielsen rating, indicating that 4.2% of American households watched the episode, and that 6% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. \\"Family Gay\\", along with \\"I Dream of Jesus\\" and \\"Road to Germany\\", were nominated in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category for the 2009 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Series creator Seth MacFarlane commented \\"We picked three of our edgier shows as a choice. Ya know, we figured if we are going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.\\" Much to the surprise of the writing staff, the series was ultimately nominated for the award, the first time in 48 years an animated series was nominated for the same category since The Flintstones in 1961, but lost to The Jack Benny Show. though The Simpsons were almost nominated in the year 1993, but that changed since Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs. The episode received divided reviews from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7.9/10, saying, \\"Overall, while it's far from being the funniest episode of the season, there were more than enough laughs and uncomfortable moments to make this episode entertaining.\\" He went on to say that the episode could have been more though, due to the fact that the show has used many clever gay jokes in the past. Likewise, Alex Rocha of TV Guide commented, \\"'Family Gay' fell way short of my expectations. Even with its traditional pop culture references and flashbacks, this week's episode could not simply keep me tuned in. I'll admit, I did manage to laugh at times, but as in previous times, Family Guy simply fell short again.\\" Steve Heisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review, calling it \\"yet another pointless exercise in Family Guy insider smugness\\", and rating it C-. In March 2009, the Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative decency campaigning group, filed an indecency complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). PTC President Tim Winter stated, \\"Fox treated viewers to everything from an 'eleven-way' gay orgy to baby Stewie possibly eating a bowl of cereal with horse semen instead of milk.\\" Dan Isett, PTC director of public policy, said that this was the first time since last fall that the PTC had asked its members to send complaints to the FCC, although the PTC regularly discusses issues it has with shows. The PTC named \\"Family Gay\\" the \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" for the week of March 13. MacFarlane responded to the PTC's decrees against the show in an interview with The Advocate, \\"For an organization that prides itself on Christian values — I mean, I’m an atheist, so what do I know? — they spend their entire day hating people.\\" References External links  * 2009 American television episodes American LGBT-related television episodes Family Guy (season 7) episodes LGBT- related animation ","title":"Family Gay"},{"id":"21113508","text":"Choate House is a historic home located at Randallstown, Baltimore County, Maryland.

It is told entirely in the first-person voice of Mariamne. A hardback edition was published by Random House in 2006, followed by a trade paperback edition published by Three Rivers Press, a Random House imprint, in December 2007. It has been translated into several languages, including Spanish, Czech, Chinese, French and Icelandic.\\"Celsus knows, moreover, certain sects...Carpocrations from Salome, and others who derive their name from Mariamne...\\"Origen, Contra Celsus 5.62) It is a tale of Mariamne's quest to understand the gnosis she experienced as a child. Longfellow said she based the book on her studies of translations of historic Jewish and Arabic texts, as well as on modern Biblical scholarship. A selected bibliography is included.  Plot summary  The story begins in the voice of the Jewess Mariamne as a child living a privileged life in her widowed father Josephus’ home in Jerusalem. Also living with them is her father’s ward, Salome, an Egyptian, the daughter of a deceased fellow merchant. Both girls are overseen by a body servant named Tata. Mariamne has just recovered from a life- threatening illness. When she revives, she is gifted (or cursed) with unexpected voiced divination. Raised like sisters and indulged by a fond father with books and lessons usually only accorded boys, Mariamne and Salome possess a thirst for knowledge, both secular and magical, that is forbidden to females. Through their devoted personal slave, they also learn worldly experience far beyond anything Josephus, a member of the elite Jewish Sanhedrin, would approve. When Mariamne reveals her gift of prophesy in front of her father and his houseguest, a merchant named Ananias, Josephus sends her out of the room, but Ananias is intrigued. Within months, Josephus, misunderstanding an exchange he sees between Salome and his houseguest, banishes Salome and the houseguest from his home and, hours later, Mariamne and her servant Tata. His daughter has to go to her uncle's strict Jewish household, where she is allowed no books. Unable to bear the loss of Salome and her books, Mariamne decides to leave. She and Tata follow Salome into banishment. Mariamne is eleven years old; Salome is twelve. For protection and ease of travel, Mariamne and Salome disguise themselves as boys. Dressed as males, they take male names: Salome is Simon; Mariamne is John. Ananias and his friends take the boys to the “Wilderness,” a hidden settlement on the northwest edge of the Dead Sea. They meet a man who will become Mariamne's mentor, the young philosopher Seth of Damascus, also a seeker of divine knowledge. They meet John the Baptist, hiding with other zealots in deserts. In the \\"Wilderness,\\" they see evidence of the struggle for Jewish freedom from Rome, and the even more complex struggle for the Temple, where Roman-backed priests practice rites of animal sacrifice that enrage zealots. They learn there are many kinds of zealots, though all await a Messiah to lead them. Salome comes to believe John the Baptist is that Messiah and a king of the Jews. Mariamne does not agree. Their differences increase after Mariamne meets John's cousin, a Galilean called Yeshua. With Seth, they travel to Alexandria, Egypt where Mariamne and Salome live in the Great Library, becoming learned in mathematics, philosophy, and poetry. Under the tutelage of Philo of Alexandria, they learn the Egyptian mysteries, specifically the ancient passion of the man-god Osiris. After seven years, Mariamne reluctantly returns to the Wilderness, but Salome is eager to return to see John the Baptist. They continue their disguise as males. Having lived as males, they remain males. Through John of the River, Mariamne (now called John the Less) meets his cousin, Yeshua of Galilee and his twin brother, Jude the Sicarii. John the Less shares with Yeshua knowledge from her studies in Egypt. Deeply confused and disturbed by the violent actions of those around him, and their expectations of a “king”, Yeshua retreats into the true wilderness of the Dead Sea region. He returns to share his revelation with his beloved friend, John the Less. Mariamne had undergone her own experience of gnosis years earlier and no longer recounts it, but Yeshua is filled with a messianic fervor to share his sense that all are divine. Mariamne (now John the Beloved Disciple) follows Yeshua as he teaches and heals, spreading his message of love and forgiveness to his followers, whose numbers continue to grow. Eventually, Yeshua’s conviction leads him to the cross. Mariamne leaves Palestine for the south of France, then called the Gallia Narbonensis. Dying in a cave, she tells her story to Seth of Damascus, who writes it all down for her. Themes Feminism is a thread that runs through the book from first to last.Moondance, Summer 2005 Historical accuracy Throughout The Secret Magdalene, Longfellow weaves historical facts and personages in her own interpretation of the Christ story. Longfellow said she based her choice of name for her lead character on the Nag Hammadi Papers, a collection of ancient Gnostic material found in 1945 in Egypt. All editions of the book include a comprehensive though selected bibliography of materials used by Longfellow. The novel has been praised by some theologians and historians but it was not reviewed in any major newspapers or journals.Earl Doherty, Review of Longfellow's The Secret Magdalene, Jesus Puzzle Seekers of Mary Magdalene have commented on its reflection of the daily life of the times, as well as the known historical personages it depicts.Magdalene.org Review: Ki Longfellow, The Secret Magdalene According to Bookreporter, “This is an imaginative novel that undoubtedly will attract a lot of attention and foster discussion about one of the most controversial and fascinating women in early Church history.”, The Bookreporter In June 2010, the book made Online Classes' list of \\"100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\\".100 All Time Best Historical Fiction Books\\", Online Classes, 1 June 2010 Parallels of author's life to the novel The central idea of the book is the realization of gnosis, a Greek word meaning divine knowledge. In Asia, such an awakening is termed enlightenment. At the age of nineteen, Longfellow had a sudden and spontaneous awakening to \\"All That Is\\". She wrote The Secret Magdalene to explore this experience through her novel.Discovery: an English Radio Two interview aired in 1990. Analysis The novel makes use of the New Testament context in order to explore a variety of philosophical, religious, and spiritual themes. It questions the meaning and significance of the Jewish tradition, Hellenistic influences, early Gnosticism, and other ancient philosophical teachings, including the mystery religions that were widespread in the ancient world. Film adaptations Writer and film director Nancy Savoca, and her husband, film producer Rich Guay, bought the film rights of the Eio edition.

In addition to providing weekly content to editors of the American labor press, the Federated press published a 12-page weekly newspaper available to subscribers and organized supporters.

Lochner, produced a monthly publication called People's Council Bulletin, which featured international news with an emphasis on the doings of the peace movement. The editor of this publication was William E. Williams, press spokesman of the People's Council.Scott Nearing,The Making of a Radical: A Political Autobiography. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1972; pg. 173. This bulletin proved the inspiration for the International Labor News Service, itself a news agency for the radical press, as octogenarian Scott Nearing recounted in his 1972 memoirs: > One day... a big, sturdy chap just past middle age came into our New York > People's Council office and showed credentials from the Western Metal > Miners. He had been reading our Bulletin and liked the material, especially > that dealing with international affairs.

Nearing,The Making of a Radical,\\" pg. 173. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a similar concept was being tested by Edward J. Costello, Managing Editor of Victor Berger's socialist daily, the Milwaukee Leader. This news service, called the Federated Press, was founded on January 3, 1920, and was intended to supply copy to labor and radical newspapers around the country. The two news agencies decided to join forces under the Federated Press banner, with Costello holding down the post of Managing Editor of the Service and Lochner acting as Business Manager. Nearing provided the service with regular installments of his writing. The service grew steadily and was ultimately mailing news releases and picture mats five days a week to some 150 labor and radical publications. William Francis Dunne was another co- founder. In August 1920, conscientious objector and university instructor Carl Haessler was released from federal penitentiary after serving a two-year sentence. He took over the job of Managing Editor from Costello, who left the employment of the service. Haessler remained at this position until the service was terminated in the 1940s. On February 4, 1922, a \\"Federated Press League\\" formed in Chicago to collect funds for the news service. Members of the league's executive board included: Robert M. Buck, Jack Carney, Arul Swabeck, Editor Feinburg, William Z. Foster (later CPUSA head), Carl Haessler, Mabel Search, Clark H. Getts, Louis P. Lochner, and Maude McCreery. In 1923 during the trial of communist leader C.E. Ruthenberg in St. Joseph, Michigan, the government prosecutor spent considerable effort while cross-examining Jay Lovestone in establishing links between the Communist Party and the Federated Press. The prosecutor attempted to prove that all funding for the Federated Press came only from \\"Communist sources.\\" Lovestone held the position that the Communist Party had tried to influence the Federated Press but had never controlled it. (In his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers directly contradicts Lovestone by calling it the \\"communist-controlled news service of my Daily Worker days.\\" ) Nearing continued to produce content for the Federated Press until 1943, when he was fired for his anti-war politics, which managing editor Haessler deemed to be \\"childish\\". The service was discontinued after the end of World War II, when the more conservative labor papers terminated their use of the service. Locations The Federated Press had its headquarters at 156 W. Washington Street in Chicago (where it shared offices with the ACLU, the Chicago Committee for Struggle Against War, the Acme News Syndicate, and the Institute for Mortuary Research). It had bureaus in New York, San Francisco, and Washington DC (where it shared offices with the Soviet official news agency TASS). The Federated Press had foreign bureaus in Berlin and Moscow.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Sudbury was originally constructed as a hospital for the United States Air Force for the D-Day landings. In 1948, the old hospital site was adapted for use as a prison. Original single storey accommodation from the hospital still houses prisoners today, with newer additional single storey buildings also used. In 2003, a new Modular Temporary Unit was constructed at the site. In December 2003, it emerged that 350 prisoners had absconded from Sudbury in five years. Management at the prison stated that this was a consequence of the prison having more inmates. In June 2005, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons praised Sudbury Prison. The report stated that Sudbury provided a safe and well-ordered environment for prisoners and staff. However the report called for certain facilities to be improved at the prison, particularly for elderly and disabled prisoners. A further inspection report in September 2007 again praised Sudbury prison, despite the fact that more than 40 prisoners had absconded from the jail since January 2007. The report however did call for better healthcare services at the prison. The prison today Sudbury is a Category D open prison for adult males. Accommodation at the prison comprises a mixture of single and double occupancy rooms. Full-time and part-time education as well as evening classes are offered to inmates at HMP Sudbury. Workshops and training courses include bricklaying, painting & decorating, industrial cleaning, farms and gardens, catering and site maintenance.

He argues with Dr Dakarai on the solutions to Darfur's problems. Pratt thinks that Sudan should sort itself out. Dr Dakarai pulls him up on this and Pratt notes that just because he's black doesn't mean he has to feel at home in Africa. They spot a mother with a sick baby and persuade her to come to the clinic but when she is there they find there is nothing they can do for her. Pratt wants to try but Carter tells him they don’t have the resources to keep the baby alive. Carter tells the woman about his own son dying in hospital (see episode Midnight) but she says she finds it hard to believe that babies die in western hospitals. Meanwhile Carter and Debbie reach the police station and speak to the officer in charge. He won’t even let them see the prisoner. Carter threatens to report them for walking in on Debbie in the shower. With this threat and a bribe they are allowed into the cells. Carter finds the Sheik and inspects him. He tells the guard that the man is dead. They are allowed to take the body and they load him into the back of the jeep. As soon as they are away from the police station Carter starts to treat the Sheik – he is not dead, but he is close to it. In the camp Carter and Debbie have saved the Sheik. He is holding his daughter for the first time. Pratt arrives and relays the news. The Sheik’s wife will live but Dr. Dakarai is missing. Debbie, Dr. Dakarai’s partner, wants to go out and search but it is too late in the day. An exhausted Pratt walks through the camp looking at the people. In the distance he sees a commotion. It is Dr. Dakarai walking back into camp. He left the jeep as soon as Pratt had gone and has been walking back ever since. Pratt hugs him. Debbie kisses him. Carter is amazed. The Sheik and his wife give their daughter a name that means ‘hope’.

Commonly described as a cross between The Sex Pistols, The Doors and The Velvet Underground,Michael Barclay, Ian A.D. Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . the band were prominent on Toronto's Queen Street West music scene. They broke up before achieving mainstream success, however, and are now remembered primarily as the inspiration behind Bruce McDonald's cult film Roadkill.Band Bio: A Neon Rome at punkhistorycanada.ca History Neal Arbic, the band's frontman, created the band in 1984 after writing a narrative poem about a rock band whose music was \\"like heroin\\" to its fans. The band's sound was reportedly inspired by accidentally playing a Psychic TV record at the wrong speed. Bassist John Borra, drummer Ken Burchell and guitarist Kevin Nizol rounded out the band's original lineup. The band began to draw attention in the Toronto club scene for its live shows, which blended Arbic's wild, charismatic frontman antics with a loose, improvisational interplay among the band. In fact, the band rarely wrote songs in advance – instead, much of its material was improvised live on stage. Burchell left the band, who continued without a drummer for a time until Ian Blurton joined to replace him. Keyboardist Bernard Maiezza joined the band at the same time as Blurton. They eventually became the house band of Elvis Mondays, a weekly underground rock night at Toronto's Beverly Hotel, and began developing a wider audience. Eventually Blurton left the band, and Burchell rejoined. The band released its debut album, New Heroin, in March 1987 on Fringe Product in Canada and New Rose Records in Europe,New Rose Records and garnered strong reviews from influential publications such as Sounds, NME and Melody Maker. Following the release of New Heroin, Nizol left the band, and was replaced by Crawford Teasdale. At this time, as well, Bruce McDonald began to develop an idea for a concert film which would document the band on tour across Northern Ontario. Collapse During the band's tour to promote New Heroin, Arbic became increasingly disillusioned with the music industry, and began to rebel against the promotional demands of leading a band seemingly on the verge of stardom. He shaved his head, he briefly adopted a diet consisting exclusively of almonds and raisins, he sometimes failed to show up for scheduled live shows, and he eventually took a vow of silence – while he would still sometimes agree to sing at live concerts and in recording sessions for their second album All the Children Are In, such occasions became fewer and farther between, and he strictly refused to speak offstage. Although the band completed recording All the Children Are In, the album was never released. McDonald's proposed film instead became Roadkill, a scripted black comedy film which fictionalized A Neon Rome as \\"Children of Paradise\\", a band which disappeared on tour after its lead singer faced a similar existential crisis. The band made a final live appearance at Toronto's Rivoli around the time of the film's release, at which Arbic whispered the lyrics instead of singing, but then broke up. Arbic embarked on a spiritual quest, regaining his mental equilibrium by following the meditation teachings of Baba Hari Dass. Borra and Maiezza went on to join Blurton's band Change of Heart, while Nizol went on to join Pure/Love Bomber and is now a member of 66 Kicks. Arbic has occasionally performed spoken word poetry at various Toronto concert venues, including the Elvis Mondays revival at the Drake Hotel,\\"Wil-MAA! Have You Seen My Sonic Youth Shirt!?\\" , zoilus.com, March 26, 2005. and has written and performed spiritual music with the band Mahendra.

History and design The DB Class V90 locomotives are similar to DB Class V 100 (Class 211 & 212) locomotives, they stemmed from a need for a heavy shunting locomotive - it was originally planned to create a heavy shunting variant of the V 100 (ballasted and with reinforced frame) to be produced, but this did not come to pass due to the design's stability problems. Maschinenbau Kiel in co-operation with BZA München designed a longer and heavier locomotive, of a completely new design. In 1964, a pilot production of 20 of these were manufactured with a engine as used in the DB Class V100.1 and a 70 km/h top speed. In 1974 the first locomotive of the main production was produced - these locomotives had the engine used in the DB Class V100.2 and a top speed of 80 km/h, the length of the locomotive was also extended to 14.32m; by 1974 408 had been built by MaK, Deutz, Henschel and Jung. The machines have both a Dead-man's vigilance device (German:Sifa) and \\"Inductive train control system\\" (German:Indusi) (see Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung) safety devices 150pxOriginally the locomotives were deep red (RAL 3004), in the mid-1970s a new ivory / ocean blue (RAL 5020 - RAL 1014) colour scheme was introduced, in the second half of the 1980s an eastern red (RAL 3031) color scheme was used and since the late'90s, the locomotives are found in the current traffic (RAL 3020) red of Deutsche Bahn AG. Since 2003, the locomotives have been upgraded with a new 1100-kW engine (type 8V 4000 R41 MTU) equipped, as well as other components being upgraded (specifically the hydraulic drive). The modernised locos save fuel despite having a higher rated engine. The serial number of the remotorised locomotives is increased by 500. (e.g. 290 030 becomes 290 530) =290 999 of the Bundeswehr= One locomotive of the class was procured by the Army for use in an Air Force supply regiment in Mechernich and given the locomotive code 290 999; on loan from the Deutsche Bundesbahn. Since January 1996 the locomotive became the property of Deutsche Bahn AG and has been given the number 290 408. After this locomotives conversion to radio control it has been numbered 294 408 MaK V 90 P / DB Class 291 Before the main production began, MaK had produced of its own accord 5 locomotives of very similar type (but with a MaK engine) for assessment for export orders; they were tested in Sweden.No orders came initially but in 1972 a derivative the MaK G 1600 BB was produced for some German private users The locomotives were called V 90 PMak \\"V 90 P\\" : P is for private (companies) not for prototype. The first two went to Dortmunder Eisenbahn.Deutsche Bundesbahn - V 90 P / 291 loks-aus-kiel.de The other 3 locomotives were leased by the Deutsche Bundesbahn for assessment - they had a requirement for heavy shunting locomotives in the ports of Hamburg, Emden and Bremen. These locomotives were classified as V 90 901 to V 90 903 (later as DB Class 291 901 onwards). In 1972 the locomotives were purchased, and in 1974 the main order of 100 further locomotives came - which were slightly lighter than the \\"P\\" locomotives. The majority were built at Kiel with ten of the hundred being built by Jung. Instead of the V12 engine found in the Class 290 (class 212), the 291 class is equipped with a MaK 8-cylinder in-line engine that produces . This type is only used for shunting (requiring high torque at low speed). The marine diesel engine is unsuitable for continuous use on the main line. The machines found use mainly in northern Germany. Radio controlled versions Two types of radio remote control have been utilised in order to make better use of these locomotives. Initially locomotives were equipped with radio equipment which allowed the Bergmeister (or Rückenmeister) (The yard hump controller) to control the locomotive. A driver still occupied the locomotive for safety reasons, and to control the locomotive. This method was used in large computer controlled marshalling yards such as Mannheim marshalling yard (German:Mannheim rbf), Seelze, Maschen, Munich, Kornwestheim Rbf and Nuremberg. Since Nuremberg Rbf has a downward gradient of the track (see Gravity Yard for an explanation), the locomotives are coupled with 6 axle flat wagon loaded with concrete weights that have been converted to brake tenders so that it is possible to stop trains of up to 2000 tons in weight. =Classes 294, 295= From 1995, large numbers of locomotives of the class were fitted a different type of radio remote produced by Krauss-Maffei (KM) derailed) 294 The remote device is carried by remote train driver (German:Lokrangierführer LRF ) in a so-called \\"Belly Box\\" (see Remote control locomotive for details) and operated in a manner similar to that of a toy car or model aircraft remote control. This type of control is used in shunting operations and was previously used with smaller shunting locomotives such as the DB Class V 60 and DB Class Köf III (DB class 331 to 335) The rebuilt locomotives of the 290 series form Class 294, rebuilt locomotives of the 291 series form Class 295 The locomotives have radio receiver in the cab, the LRF (remote train driver) must manually turn on the locomotive cab radio using a key switch on the locomotives control panel. A vehicle equipped with this type of remote control has a lamp above the cab window that lights to indicate that the locomotive is capable of receiving the radio signal. This means that the remote train driver (LRF) can now operate the locomotive at the trackside. Various functions can be activated remotely - brakes, start, Vkonstant: i.e. running speed is automatically maintained, Sand, clutch etc. =Class 296= In 2007 locomotives of Class 290 which already had radio control for use in marshalling yards had the newer Krauss-Maffei remote fitted as well, allowing trackside control. These units were given the classification Class 296 and are found in the marshalling yards at Gremberg, Mannheim, Munich and Northern Seelze. 45 locomotives are expected to be rebuilt to have both types of remoted control. Future Deutsche Bahn AG has announced that the diesel locomotives of series 291 and 295 will be replaced with Voith Gravita locomotives from 2010 onwards.

History The community was established in the 1880s, with a post office established by 1886. In May 1891, labor recruiters brought African-Americans to Franklin from Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee with offers of good paying jobs and free transportation. The white miners who were on strike took exception to the African-American strikebreakers and tensions grew for a month and a half. In early July, a riot broke out resulting in the deaths of two people and the Governor called out the National Guard to restore order. In 1885 the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad was extended from Black Diamond to the town, allowing most of the coal to be shipped to San Francisco. On August 24, 1894, the worst mine disaster in King County history occurred at the Oregon Improvement Company mine in Franklin. A fire caused thirty-seven miners to suffocate in the mine. A jury later found that the fire had been intentionally set, but the person responsible had also perished in the disaster. By the early twentieth century, demand fell and mining became more difficult, causing the mine to shut down. The post office closed in 1916. By 1919 nearly all mining had ceased at Franklin and residents vacated, though a few families including the Moore family remained behind. Ernest Moore later wrote a book about his African-American family's experiences in The Coal Miner Who Came West (1982). From the late 1940s through 1971, Palmer Coking Coal Company mined both surface and underground coal in and around the town site of Franklin. This mining ended in late March 1971 when a coal car bridge across the Green River was blasted in a ceremony attended by many local dignitaries. In 1984-1985 the Green River Community College archaeology department, led by Gerald Hedlund and Mark Vernon, conducted digs at the abandoned town site. The report, From Smoke to Mist: An archeological study of Franklin, WA. - A Turn of the Century Company Coal Town was published in 1994 which in turn relied on research by historian John Hanscom.\\"From Smoke to Mist\\" by Hedlund & Vernon, 1994; State of Washington Coal Mine Inspectors Report for 1894; Enumclaw Courier-Herald April 1, 1971; Company Coal Town: Franklin and the Oregon Improvement Company, 1880-1896 by John Hanscom, Green River Community College 1988; Washington's Green River Coal County: 1880-1930 by C.

Pg, 3.Maimonides' responsa siman (117 (Blau) / 373 (Freimann)); translated by Rabbi Yosef Qafih and reprinted in his Collected Papers, Volume 1, footnote 1 on pages 475-476 (Hebrew: שאלה, יורנו הדרתו מה לומר למי ששאל שאלה בענין שעור קומה האם הוא כדברי מי שאמר שהוא חבור אחד הקראים ושמע את זאת מהדרתכם, או שהוא סוד מסודות החכמים ז\\"ל וכמוסים בו ענינים גדולים טבעיים או אלהיים כמו שאמר רבנו האיי ז\\"ל באחד הקונדרסים בעניני חגיגה. ושכרו כפול מן השמים. תשובה, איני סבור כלל שהוא לחכמים ז\\"ל ואינו אלא חיבור אחד הדרשנים בערי אדום ולא יותר. כללו של דבר השמדת אותו הספר והכרתת זכר ענינו מצוה רבה, ושם אלהים אחרים לא תזכירו וכו' כי אשר לו קומה הוא אלהים אחרים בלי ספק.). See also ibid. p. 477-478 where a booklet found in Maimonides' Genizah with the text of Shi'ur Qomah appears with an annotation, possibly by Maimonides, cursing believers of Shi'ur Qomah (Hebrew: \\"ארור המאמינו\\") and praying that God be elevated exceedingly beyond that which the heretics say (Judeo-Arabic: \\"תע' ת'ם תע' עמא יקולון אלכאפרון\\"; Hebrew: \\"יתעלה לעילא לעילא ממה שאומרים הכופרים\\"). Rabbi Saadia Gaon also expressed doubts about the origin of the text, and stated that “since it is not found in either Mishna or Talmud, and since we have no way of establishing whether or not it represents the words of Rabbi Yishmael; perhaps someone else pretended to speak in his name.” Judah b. Barzilai, Peirush Sefer Yetzira, ed. Solomon Zalman, Hayyim Halberstam, Berlin 1885. Pg. 21 Nonetheless in the case that the text were somehow proven to be genuine, Saadia wrote that it would have to be understood in line with his “theory of 'created glory,'\\" which explains the prophetic theophanies as visions not of God Himself but of a luminous [created] substance.”Von der mittelalterlichen zur modernen Aufklärung: Studien zur jüdischen Geistesgeschichte. Alexander Altmann. Published by Mohr Siebeck, 1987. Pg. 132 Rabbi Moses Narboni also wrote a philosophic work about the text entitled Iggeret Al-Shi'ur Qomah (Heb: אגרת על שיעור קומה lit. Epistle on Shi’ur Qomah), wherein he dismisses the blatant anthropomorphisms of Shi'ur Qomah as speaking strictly metaphorically. Rabbi Narboni’s work in the Iggeret is a “meditation on God, Measure of all existing things. It is based on Abraham Ibn Ezra's commentary on Exodus, and, with the aid of biblical and rabbinical passages, studies two kinds of knowledge: God's knowledge of his creatures, called knowledge of the Face; and His creatures’ knowledge of God, called knowledge of the Back (an allusion to Exodus 33:23).” A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages.

Accessed October 28, 2018. \\"A Cherry Hill East graduate, Foley, 49, will guide the Owls in the Military Bowl against Wake Forest on Dec. 27 in Annapolis, Md.\\" Playing career Foley was a three-year starter at Bucknell University, playing one season as a guard and two as a center. During his junior year, he was named the Bison's top lineman. As a senior, he served as the team's captain. Early coaching career Foley coached the offensive line at University at Albany, SUNY from 1989 to 1990. He served as an assistant coach at the University of Pennsylvania from 1991 to 1993, and again from 1995 to 1997. At Penn, Foley coached tight ends and tackles for five years and helped the Quakers to a perfect 10–0 record and an Ivy League championship in 1993. Foley was the offensive line coach for Williams College in 1994. Foley spent the 1998 season as the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Jacksonville University, the first time the university sponsored a football. His Dolphin offense averaged 380 passing yards (190 passing, 190 rushing) and 30.1 points per game. Fordham Foley coached the Fordham Rams for seven seasons, including two seasons as head coach. As Fordham's offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, Foley helped rejuvenate a program that won the Patriot League championship in 2002 with a 10–3 record. In 2000, Foley's offense established a running game that set a team record for most rushing yards in a single (1,635 yards, an average of 149 per game). In 2001, the Fordham offense had its first 1,000-yard rusher and first-ever 1,000-yard receiver on the NCAA Division I-AA level. That yearm Rams had the second- ranked passing offense in the Patriot League and the second-best scoring offense as well. In 2002, Fordham led the Patriot League in passing and scoring offense, while finishing second in total offense, and setting a team record for most points in a season. In addition to winning the Patriot League title, the Rams advanced to the NCAA I-AA Playoffs, where they defeated the Northeastern Huskies in the first round. In 2003, six members of the Rams offense were named to the All-Patriot League Team, including four whom were named to the first team. The Rams broke the team record for most rushing yards in a season for the second time in Foley's tenure (1,657 yards), while also setting a school record for most pass completions in a season (255). As head coach, Foley had a 7–15 record over two seasons with a 4–8 conference record. Foley's short tenure as head coach was due to his poor record and not endearing himself to his players. Hofstra Foley spent three seasons at Hofstra University as the assistant head coach, offensive coordinator, and offensive line coach. In his first year as coordinator, the team's total yardage increased from 269 to 388 yards per game and from 16.8 to 26.9 points per game. Foley also brought balance to the Pride attack as Hofstra's rushing total was its highest since 2000 (145 yards/game) and its passing attack netted 243 yards per contest.

Foley coached Temple in the 2016 Military Bowl. Following the Military Bowl, Foley was retained by Geoff Collins as Temple's tight ends coach. In 2018, Foley was promoted to assistant head coach of offense.

The story revolves around the Japanese teenage boy Ranma Saotome who has trained in martial arts since early childhood. As a result of an accident during a training journey in China, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series Ranma seeks out a way to rid his curse, while his friends, enemies and many fiancées constantly hinder and interfere. Many of the characters are similarly cursed to turn into animals or other creatures when splashed and are skilled in different and unusual types of martial arts. The large cast's intricate relationships with one another, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive most of the stories. Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series. Saotome family =Ranma Saotome= Female Ranma voiced by: Megumi Hayashibara (Japanese, also young Ranma); Brigitta Dau (English, Viz Media dub; until episode 6), Venus Terzo (English, Viz Media dub; after episode 6), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia dub); Barbara Tissier (French); Jeong-Hwa Yang (Korean); Irma Carmona (Spanish) Male Ranma voiced by: Kappei Yamaguchi (Japanese); Sarah Strange (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 1-3), Richard Ian Cox (English, Viz Media dub; after season 3), Darren Pleavin (English, Animax Asia dub); Luq Hamet (French); Clemens Ostermann (German); Massimiliano Alto (Italian); Su-Jin Kang (Korean); Carlos Hugo Hidalgo (Spanish); Luis Daniel Ramirez (Spanish, OVA) Portrayed by: Kento Kaku (male Ranma), Natsuna Watanabe (female Ranma)Kappei Yamaguchi provides the voice for the male half of Ranma Saotome in the anime. , is the series' main protagonist. A 16-year-old proficient martial artist, he spent most of his youth on training trips with his father. The last of these trips led them to Jusenkyo, China, where he fell into the Spring of Drowned Girl and changed into a well-built girl with red hair (in the anime; it remains black in the manga). Since then, he changes to this girl form any time he is doused with cold water, while hot water returns him to a boy. Thanks to an agreement between his father and Soun Tendo, he is engaged to Soun's daughter Akane. Due to a series of other involuntary entanglements, he has several additional love interests, most notably the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, okonomiyaki chef and childhood friend Ukyo Kuonji and Kodachi Kuno, the younger sister of rival Tatewaki Kuno. He is very much in love with Akane, but does not want to admit it. When another man shows general interest in her, he can't help but grow jealous leading him to becoming depressed, scheming something to separate them, or growing worried. Martial arts is the 16-year-old hero's life. Whenever his pride is damaged, Ranma will go to great lengths to rectify the situation. He can come across as petty, arrogant and disrespectful, as he is prone to bragging and tossing insults. Despite these flaws, he retains a moral center throughout the series and has little to no problems helping those in need. Ranma also has an extreme fear of cats resulting from when his father trained him in the misconcepted technique. If he is isolated with a cat in a very small space, or when he can no longer cope with his fear of cats, he begins behaving like a cat himself and becomes a master of the 'Cat Fu' and only Akane can calm him down. He and Akane drift closer throughout the series, each going to great lengths to save the other when in trouble. The reason why Ranma tolerates his big number of suitors is not only because he is generally very friendly and caring towards them (going through great lengths to make sure Shampoo doesn't hate him, for example), but mainly because he considers himself a hunk. In spite of this, Ranma is the butt of most of the violence that happens in the story. Rumiko Takahashi herself has described Ranma's personality as a mixture of nice, clean-cut, frank, energetic, indecisive, stubborn, picky, stingy and sly,Ranma½ Memorial Book http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi2.html and has stated that she finds flawless characters rather boring.Animerica Vol.9, #6, June 2001; http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi10.html She addressed the origins of the character as: \\"With Ranma ½, I had thought a lot of doing a series with a male/female like protagonist, and since in the greater part of my previous stories the main character had been a woman, I planned to use a man this time. I was worried about writing a male main character because of the hundreds and hundreds of male readers, therefore I decided on the character being half man and half woman.\\"Kappa Magazine #5, November 1992; http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi8.html At the 1994 San Diego Comic- Con, in response to the question of what would happen if Ranma became impregnated, Takahashi answered, \\"I don't want to think about that, and you shouldn't either.\\"Ledoux, Trish. The Complete Anime Guide: Japanese Animation Film Directory & Resource Guide. Tiger Mountain Press, 1997. , 9780964954250. p. 65 (Search page). \\"This is actually one of the questions which came up during a question and answer session held during a recent Takahashi appearance at the 1994 San Diego Comic-Con in California.[...]What really _would_ happen if Ranma got pregnant? \\"I don't want to think about that, and you shouldn't either\\")\\" =Genma Saotome= Voiced by: Kenichi Ogata (Japanese); Robert O Smith (English; Viz Media dub), Dave Bridges (English; Animax Asia dub); Serge Bourrier (French); Thomas Rauscher (German); Michele Kalamera (Italian) Portrayed by: Arata Furuta is Ranma's father and the sensei of the . He trained with Soun under Happosai. Because they were treated like slaves, they eventually sealed him within a cave and opened their own schools. Starting from a young age, Genma took Ranma on a continuous training trip to perfect his skills. So his wife Nodoka would agree to this plan, he promised to turn Ranma into a \\"man-among-men\\" under the threat of them both committing seppuku if he failed. He originally took Ranma to Jusenkyo because he had heard about it in a Chinese brochure even though he cannot read a word of Chinese. During their training there, Genma fell into a cursed spring, which gave him a giant panda curse. Unlike Ranma, he doesn't have much trouble with his curse, especially because he can get away from his problems in his panda form. He and Ranma eventually return to Japan to fulfill an arranged marriage between Ranma and Akane to keep the school going. He hides from his wife by staying as a panda while she is around, and she simply believes Ranko, Ranma's female form, has \\"Mr. Panda\\" as a pet. Genma follows his own interpretation of the \\"Indiscriminate Grappling\\" code, which is not exactly all that virtuous itself to begin with. He frequently preaches duty and honor as a martial artist, but seems to be a poor example by which to set those standards. Though he himself claims to be a model martial artist, and makes a point of telling Ranma about the right thing to do, he is not above acting cowardly, stealing a dowry, or only looking out for his own well being. He usually tries to flee from any problems he has caused or is entangled in, foisting the matter on Ranma if he cannot. His love of food regularly overpowers his love of his son, once trading him for a bowl of ramen, and in another, he traded the infant Ranma for a meal of fish. He is very open with his panda form, and regularly uses it to avoid questions as pandas cannot speak. In panda form, he communicates by writing on wooden signs which he seems to pull out of a type of hammerspace in that form. While he's usually either too lazy or scared to show it, Genma is an accomplished martial artist. He is extremely strong and agile despite his size, and his panda form increases his abilities even further, managing to give his son a run for his money in most of their serious battles or spars. Most of his special techniques are ridiculous to behold (but, amazingly enough, not completely useless), and he uses those quite often. However, he created a couple of \\"serious\\" schools: the Umisenken that allows him to hide his aura and execute ambush attacks from behind; and the Yamasenken that allows him to make opponents lose focus, create powerful vacuum-slice barrages, or strike deadly, piercing blows. These techniques having been found to be much more dangerous than he thought, he decided to seal them; he is revealed to have created the techniques to be able to survive in dire conditions by way of thieving. He usually resorts to grapple Ranma in the way he grapples a tire when he is a panda to sway him. Genma is also able to invoke a battle aura of epic proportions similar to Happosai's, but he can only use it for very brief periods (possibly just half a minute) before collapsing from overexertion, making it rather useless. =Nodoka Saotome= Voiced by: Masako Ikeda (Japanese); Lisa Bunting (English, Viz Media dub) is Ranma's mother and Genma's wife. She has not seen them in over a decade though, when they left on their training trip. Stating that a doting mother would hinder Ranma's training, Genma made a contract with her to raise Ranma as a \\"man amongst men\\". If he failed, he and Ranma were to commit seppuku, a ritual suicide common among the samurai. She always has a katana with her for that purpose. Because Ranma's curse made him a woman half the time, they spent most of Nodoka's appearances hiding from her as Akane's cousin \\"Ranko\\" and her pet, Mr. Panda. Nodoka's heart was constantly broken by knowing that she wanted nothing more than to see her son again. She, in turn, is largely uninterested in Genma. Near the end of the manga series, Nodoka finally discovered Ranma and Genma's dual identities and curses. She was more accepting than they had ever expected, mostly because she eventually began to suspect that Ranma and Ranko were, in fact, the same person. Once she learned the truth, she decided not to force them to commit seppuku so long as Ranma stayed interested in girls and continued to fight like a \\"man among men.\\" She later moved in with them, allowing the three of them to be a \\"normal\\" family again. Tendo family =Akane Tendo= Voiced by: Noriko Hidaka (Japanese); Myriam Sirois (English; Viz Media dub), Claudia Thomas (English; Animax Asia dub); Magali Barney (French); Stella Musy (Italian); Min-Jeong Yeo (Korean); Tatiane Kelpmair (Portuguese); Patricia Acevedo (Spanish, OVA), Rossy Aguirre (American Spanish), Victoria Ramos (European Spanish) Portrayed by: Yui Aragaki is the female protagonist of the series and Soun's youngest daughter at age 16. She first encountered Ranma's male form as a naked stranger emerging from a hot bath in the bathroom, as she had up to that point only known him in girl form. Her family chose her to be engaged to him and carry on the Tendo family dojo. Due to numerous arguments and misunderstandings, their engagement was not off to a good start and both later mellow out. In spite of Ranma's apparent derision, Akane is actually often revered due to her beauty and strength. Akane regularly feels inferior to Kasumi in beauty and feminine pursuits, to Ranma and his other fiancées in cooking, martial arts ability or gymnastics, and to other students in swimming. She is trying hard to excel in everything, but is either clumsy or completely inept at all (especially cooking — the taste of her cooking can incapacitate most people for a significant amount of time) except for schoolwork and certain sports activities, like volleyball. She is also a capable martial artist, particularly excelling in the use of a wide variety of archaic weaponry, and is quite popular with the boys at school, though she would prefer a little less attention from them, especially Tatewaki Kuno. When someone, frequently Ranma, belittles her lack of success, or calls her uncute, ugly, over-muscled, unfeminine and tomboyish, she often feels upset and also gets very jealous when one of Ranma's other fiancées show physical affection towards him, although she will often state that she is not affected. She loves Ranma deep down, despite frequently refusing to show it. However, in the end of the manga, they both learn the affection they have for each other, and decide to accept it openly. Akane's personality usually swings from violent, hot- tempered, aloof, bad-mannered scorn towards her suitor to friendliness regarding other loved ones or just strangers in general. In spite of her apparent disadvantages, out of the three fiancées, Akane is considered to have the best claim as a suitor for Ranma; this puts her as the main target for the rest of the fiancées. =Soun Tendo= Voiced by: Ryusuke Obayashi (Japanese); David Kaye (English, Viz Media dub), Russell Wait (English, Animax Asia dub); Giovanni Petrucci (Italian); Bardo Miranda (Spanish) Portrayed by: Katsuhisa Namase the head of the Tendo family, one of two that practices Anything Goes Martial Arts. He has a large house that is occasionally in need of repairs due to the fights that take place there. While he owns the Musabetsu Kakutō Ryū Tendo Dojo and is its current master, it has not been explicitly shown to have students, making the source of his income uncertain. Community representatives frequently approach him when they have problems with unusual phenomena, so this may provide some of it, and he has rented out the dojo for social meetings. He is shown to be quite careful with the expenses and gets upset when his daughter Nabiki spends his savings on expensive gifts, or when Ranma throws dinner on the floor. In spite of this, he is a very mindful and accommodating host at his dojo towards all sorts of visitors. He studied under the founder of the style, Happosai, with Genma, who is a close friend. Their training was nothing short of abuse and slave labor, so they eventually managed to get away from him. He and Genma set up an arranged marriage between his daughter, Akane, and Ranma in order to unite the Tendo and Saotome Schools and continue its legacy. Despite protests from both parties, they believe the two will eventually grow to love each other. Soun is eager for his daughter to say she loves Ranma or vice versa. He'll start announcing wedding plans if Ranma and Akane seem romantically involved. Soun is very emotional, often brought to tears just by thinking of a sad thought (though this tendency to cry is an anime-only trait). He is also a widower, left to single-handedly take care of his three daughters. He is very respectful to his deceased wife, whose grave he visits regularly, and he constantly mourns her. He's extremely protective of his three girls, especially Kasumi, and becomes sad if their affection is in doubt. Perhaps for this reason, he tends to become very angry whenever he suspects that Ranma is 'cheating' on Akane or otherwise is treating her badly, being intensely paranoid in this regard. He generally assumes that most incidents are Ranma's fault, and he often manifests himself as a ghostly, floating oni head to scare or intimidate Ranma in such a situation. In combat, Soun frequently fights clad fully in traditional samurai armor and he is skilled in both hand-to-hand combat and the use of a wide variety of archaic weaponry. In the anime, he spends most of his time playing shogi with his old training partner Genma. =Nabiki Tendo= Voiced by: Minami Takayama (Japanese); Angela Costain (English; Viz Media dub), Saffron Henderson (English, singing; Viz Media dub), Elaine Wotten Costain (English, Viz Media dub; fill-in), Candice Moore (English; Animax Asia dub); Emanuela D'Amico (Italian); Ana María Grey (Spanish) Portrayed by: Maki Nishiyama is Soun's middle daughter, age 17, and a sharp contrast to her older sister. She is a completely amoral businesswoman who loves money above all else and is willing to sacrifice anyone to gain more. She regularly turns very ruthless and manipulative for the cause of profit or entertainment. She is willing to stoop to considerable lows, and is completely at peace with being this way, being comparatively sane and balanced. She is recurrently used as a spoof of excessive materialism, with her extreme greed highlighted for comedic effect. Nabiki tends to sell useful or nonworking items others have need of, and ships images of Ranma's girl form to admirers. Although a hedonist who generally takes a laid-back amused approach to the regular chaos, she has keen observation skills and a mean sense of humor. She is a flexible strategist, an expert actress who is capable of lying or faking sentiments without the slightest guilt, and is generally unflappable. She, however, does harbor a vague sympathy with Kuno (her classmate) as she affectionately calls him \\"Kuno Baby\\". She has been stated to not possess any maidenly feelings, but she isn't above using her attractive appearance as a lure. In the \\"Bean-Gun Plant\\" story, Nabiki invested some of her earnings in stocks, but she is unwilling to spend her own money. She would rather steal Akane's wardrobe, get spoiled by an admirer, or empty Soun's savings to buy expensive items. She was briefly engaged to Ranma after Akane got frustrated with him, and rented him out as slave labour, but she also brought the two back together after Ranma seemed to demand too much effort. Some of her more extreme acts include ruining her family to win a bet, blackmailing anybody with a crush on her for everything she can get, destroying Nodoka's house for entertainment, her sister's wedding for the chance of gifts, engineering the injury of a rival swindler while feigning affection, framing Ranma himself for attempted rape, despite him saving her life, or even casually selling female Ranma to a criminal casino. The only characters within the Dojo that don't seem to run any debts with her are Akane and Kasumi, though she sees her own efforts towards uniting Ranma and Akane as a tab that Ranma eventually has to pay. Nabiki is shown in the anime to practice tennis, as evident by her carrying of a sports bag with a racket attached in a scene with Cologne, Ranma and Happosai where she interrupts their fight over a magic mirror by stepping on said mirror. =Kasumi Tendo= Voiced by: Kikuko Inoue (Japanese); Willow Johnson (English, Viz Media dub), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia dub); Christine Stichler (German) Portrayed by: Kyoko Hasegawa is the eldest daughter of the Tendo family at age 19, and the most traditional in the Japanese sense, standing out as genial and pleasant compared to everyone else. She has graduated from high school and spends most of her day looking after the Tendo household, acting as the family's substitute \\"matriarch\\" by cooking, cleaning, and helping her family since her mother's untimely death. She has no interest in younger men, and Dr. Tofu Ono, the family physician, is deeply in love with her, though she has no idea about it. She just considers him to be a good friend and finds his antics amusing. Seemingly unaffected by the lunacy that is surrounding her, Kasumi is one of the few characters who never gets hurt at any point in the series, notwithstanding her temporary possession by a mischievous oni. She's also occasionally shown as wiser and more perceptive than readily apparent, and can see through Nabiki's schemes. Beyond taking care of the household, she's been shown to go out to meet friends and has borrowed a pressure point book from Dr. Tofu. She is also one of the only female characters who Happosai has never groped, though he has flirted with her. She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue in the Japanese anime and by Willow Johnson in English. In the Live Action Special, she is played by Kyōko Hasegawa. Chinese Amazons The Chinese Amazons are known in Japanese as the Joketsuzoku (Rǔjiézú, 女傑族): the name more accurately translates as . =Shampoo= Voiced by: Rei Sakuma (Japanese); Cathy Weseluck (English, Viz Media dub), Candice Moore (English, Animax Asia dub); Ilaria Stagni (Italian); Mi-Sook Jeong (Korean) is the champion of the Nyucheizu village. She came to Japan to kill the female Ranma, after he defeated her in an annual martial arts contest since he and Genma had hungrily devoured the prize, a well- stocked banquet table, while coming upon and watching the contest. Shampoo gave Ranma the \\"Kiss of Death\\", a promise to track 'her' down and eventually kill 'her'. Later, after male Ranma accidentally defeated her, she gave him the \\"Kiss of Marriage\\", since the laws of her village force her to kill any female defeaters and marry male ones. Once she learned of his curse, she returned home, heartbroken. As punishment for her failure to kill female Ranma or marry male Ranma, her great-grandmother Cologne brought her to Jusenkyo for retraining. During this training, she fell into the \\"Spring of Drowned Cat\\", making her cursed to turn into a cat, the one thing Ranma fears most, and she blames him for this status. Despite this, Shampoo is no longer fixated on wanting to kill Ranma, and now just wants to marry him. Having returned to Nerima, Tokyo, Japan, she waits tables at the Cat Cafe (Nekō Hanten), her great-grandmother's restaurant. She also sometimes delivers ramen by bicycle, occasionally running down people — particularly Ranma — on the streets and rooftops. She is actively pursued by Mousse, a childhood friend for whom she generally shows nothing but disdain. Shampoo speaks with a simplified mode of speech, most notably rapidly switching between ignoring and using personal pronouns, because of having a limited amount of time to learn the Japanese language. She is described as \\"innocent and aggressive\\", being very affectionate and cheerful, while simultaneously being devious and forceful. Her personal motto is \\"obstacle is for killing\\", and she is more than willing to assassinate any \\"obstacle\\" in the path of a goal or just for the sake of convenience. For instance she has attempted to brainwash Ranma into loving her. She will also relentlessly bully people, or to put others, including her \\"groom\\", through sadistic and sometimes painful games for her own amusement. She has very little modesty, and attempts to use nudity to seduce Ranma in public places. She is sometimes compared to Lum Invader from Takahashi's earlier Urusei Yatsura due to the similarities in their character designs and openly clingy personalities. She has shown that she is not past hurting Ranma's other fiancees. She is considerably more insistent than any of them, though her plans to woo Ranma are generally more violent and devious than his other suitors with the possible exception of Kodachi. She is not above hurting Ranma either, and is shown to be mostly uninterested in winning his affections by playing fair, though she isn't completely heartless. She is highly skilled in unarmed combat, possessing considerable speed and agility. Shampoo is strong enough to casually walk through reinforced stone walls on a regular basis; in the anime she says she does this because the door takes too long. She can also efficiently use certain supernatural acupressure techniques for instant unconsciousness, temporary mind-control, or even selective memory- removal. (In the manga, she appears to aggressively wash her adversaries hair for these effects, hence her name.) Her weakness is her lack of durability, as she is recurrently defeated by single forceful attacks. She uses a pair of \\"chúi\\" as her primary weapons. Shampoo is constantly ogled by Mousse, her childhood friend and pretender, since Mousse is as clingy to Shampoo as Shampoo is to Ranma. She is generally unfazed and violent towards his affections because she has made Ranma her main priority; Shampoo is shown to have given Mousse various opportunities to woo her, though his clumsiness always gets the better of him. Mousse is generally shown to bear some maliciousness towards everyone except Shampoo (ironically this is because of Shampoo), though he is actually very polite, friendly and respectful. Her bald, bespectacled, and mustachioed, \\"stereotypically Chinese\\" father has only appeared occasionally as a background character in the manga or anime, when watching her supposed training/punishment against Cologne at Jusenkyo, or working as a cook in the restaurant. However, he did appear as the final opponent of a 1990 video game, wherein he challenged Ranma due to the perceived bad treatment of his daughter. =Cologne= Voiced by: Miyoko Aso (Japanese); Elan Ross Gibson (English, Viz Media dub; first voice), Kathleen Barr (English, Viz Media dub; second voice), Claudia Thomas (English, Animax Asia dub); Magda Giner (Spanish) is the great-grandmother of Shampoo. She accompanies Shampoo on her return to Japan to see what this “future son-in- law” was made of, but she ended up staying so that she could aid Shampoo in winning Ranma's heart. She also opens the Cat Café in Nerima, where Shampoo and Mousse both work. She is a contemporary of Happosai, and well over three hundred years old, according to the anime. She calls Ranma \\"bride-groom\\" and \\"son-in-law\\" due to her attempts to have him marry Shampoo, just to watch him become enraged. Unlike the rest of the cast, Cologne seems to prefer to sit in the background and watch the madness unfold. If she has a motive, whether it is to help Shampoo in her efforts or to aid Ranma in his battles, only then will she step into the fray. She gets around by pogoing on a gnarled wooden staff that she sometimes uses as a weapon. Cologne is usually the voice of experience and knowledge to most of the cast, a contrast to the devious master Happosai (who exclusively serves as a constant foe). She is a grand master of the Chinese Amazon martial arts, and occasionally teaches Ranma and his rivals new techniques, such as the Kachū Tenshin Amaguriken, Hiryū Shōten Ha and Bakusai Tenketsu. She is the only martial artist in the series whose skill rivals that of Happosai, enabling her to, for example, casually defeat either Ranma or Taro's chimaera form. In addition to Cologne's immense skill, she is able to manipulate water and ice, create whirlwinds by using an opponent's aura against them, shatter inanimate objects with a simple touch, fire chi- blasts, and touch pressure points to make a person feel like they are burning with even the slightest amount of heat. She is also knowledgeable in several other disciplines such as arcane lore, cooking, Chinese mythology, and magic artifacts. =Mousse= Voiced by: Toshihiko Seki (Japanese); Brad Swaile (English, Viz Media dub); Francesco Bulckaen (Italian); Jose Antonio Macias (Spanish) is a male Chinese fighter from the warrioress tribe, whose love for his childhood friend Shampoo has been unrequited. He has been in love with her for most of his life, but she finds him annoying at best, rebuking his advances ever since they were children. He comes to Nerima in search of this \\"new fiancé\\" that Shampoo has, and he stays to attempt to woo his sweetheart. He is extremely jealous of Ranma, who is the target of Shampoo's affection, and he believes he needs to defeat or kill Ranma in order to have her care for him. She states that she will reject him even in such a case, and often attacks him because of his obsessiveness. Despite his becoming a far more dangerous fighter than Shampoo, she almost never affords him any measure of respect, though when she does, Mousse's clumsiness gets the better of him. He works in the Cat Cafè (Nekō Hanten) with Shampoo and Cologne. Shampoo is well aware of Mousse's love for her, so she never actually sends him away or uses this to take advantage of him in her efforts to woo Ranma; this, however, doesn't prevent Mousse from engaging in combat with Ranma for her sake. Mousse has extremely bad eyesight, which requires him to wear thick glasses, but he usually has them concealed within his robes or propped up on his forehead, leading him to sometimes mistake people and inanimate objects for other people. Due to his bad eyesight, he walked into a cursed spring, which turns him into a duck. Although Mousse's view is blurry without his glasses and below average even with them, he has apparently learned to compensate for it in combat, as this has not hindered him from maintaining high accuracy entirely without assistance. Mousse is an amazingly skilled, swift, strong, and dangerous martial artist, who fights by using hidden weapons. His arsenal includes chains, blades, darts, iron balls, hidden knives, bombs, tear gas, and even yo-yos and various silly household appliances, manifesting quantities far beyond what he is realistically able to carry in his long sleeves and robe. He calls this ability \\"dark magic\\" simply because he is hiding objects in a dark place. He can also hide weapons in the feathers of his duck form and is able use them proficiently while flying. He is also extremely skilled in the unarmed Joketsuzoku style used by other Amazons. He is technically almost, but not quite in the same league as Ranma and Ryoga, apparently at least as strong as the former, and likely deadlier than either, though he has never managed to come out the victor in any confrontations with them, despite fighting unarmed combatants. =Pink and Link= Pink and Link are a pair of identical twin herbalist Amazons from the neighbouring herbalist village to that of Shampoo, who once played a cruel prank on her, with the help of Mandragora seeds. Pink is shown to use poisons to attack people, which Link cures in turn; this causes people to mix them up. In their arc, Shampoo warns Ranma that she presented him to the local news at her village as husband and wife; this apparently would cause former rivals of Shampoo to attempt attacks against Ranma. Ranma is attacked while on the street by Pink, but cured by Link; not knowing that they are twins, Ranma lashes at Link, which causes her to run away from him. Later, they attack Shampoo's restaurant claiming that Shampoo attacked them under the very same circumstances, earning their enmity. Shampoo promptly kicks them out and reveals that she usually violently bullied the girls every time she came back to China, as payback and revenge to the initial prank, while claiming fully innocent victimization. Later, they attack Ranma at the Tendo Dojo and end up kidnapping Shampoo. Ranma informs Cologne of the situation and she offers the mouthed sword Zhandudao and the shield Poduduan to fend the twins' attacks. The twins grow an enormous flower at the front of the restaurant and tie Shampoo from its pestles. Ranma climbs the flower and attacks the twins with a reluctant Poduduan, which turns out to be a single-use weapon. Link melts Zhandudao with her medicinal herbs. Shampoo wakes up and starts manipulating the twins to continue their plan as a ruse to lure Ranma. The twins manage to paralyze Ranma and Shampoo and fly away together on top of the detached petals of the flower. They land at Ranma and Akane's school, where a thick garden grows at the entrance. They imprison Ranma and Shampoo inside a poisonous vine cage. Akane receives from Cologne a powerful fan named Fuo-Shenshan, the fire scepter Fuo-Yanshan, and a paper doll that can take on harm in the place of anyone, but can be used just once. She barges into the garden and confronts the twins, freeing Shampoo and Ranma. As Shampoo was still trying to lure Ranma, she turns against them and chases them with the twins. Ranma, Akane and Shampoo are trapped by some vine seeds planted by Link and knocked over. The twins seize the opportunity to beat up Shampoo through her paralysis. Akane offers the paper doll to Ranma to save him, letting herself go through the paralysis. Shampoo begins beating up the twins while still sleeping. Ranma finds them and they try to escape the garden, which is spewing poisonous gases; Ranma tries to use the fan and the scepter, but they backfire. Poisoned, the twins are able to concoct an antidote that they give to Ranma, severely burning his lips. With the four girls unconscious, Ranma feeds the scepter with the scalding medicine which makes it spew fire and he is able to gain enough impulse to escape the garden while carrying the four girls. Ranma is able to land safely with the unconscious girls, but as a result of the fall he breaks his legs. While recovering from his injuries, Ranma is visited by Shampoo, who informs him that the village newspaper is running a story by the twins that portrays him as a wimp. Nevertheless, Ranma angrily refuses to ever again getting involved with the twins. Kuno family =Tatewaki Kuno= Voiced by: Hirotaka Suzuoki (Japanese), Koji Tsujitani (Japanese, fill in for episodes 65, 66, 68 & OVA 13); Ted Cole (English, Viz Media dub), Russell Wait (English, Animax Asia dub); Manuel Straube (German); Christian Iansante (Italian); Hwan-Jin Kim (Korean); Gabriel Gama (Spanish), Luis Daniel Ramirez (Spanish) Played by: Kento Nagayama is an upperclassman at Furinkan High School and the older brother of Kodachi Kuno. Hailing from a very wealthy family, he wields both his fortune and his bokken with equal ease. He has a large ego, creating the nickname \\"The Blue Thunder of Furinkan High\\", a moniker used by no one else, for himself. His ego is further apparent in that he is unable to conceive of Akane or female-form Ranma NOT being in love with him, and frequently assumes their actions are geared toward winning his affections. When speaking, he uses a regal tone (or Shakespearesque in the English version). At the show's start, he has been madly in love with Akane for some time. After being defeated by Ranma in his female form, he also falls for the \\"Pigtailed Girl\\" as he calls \\"her\\". After briefly wrestling with his competing desires, Tatewaki decides he wants to be with them both and, in keeping with his ego, assumes that they are so in love with him that they will accept this. Tatewaki never realizes that the Pigtailed Girl is really his mortal enemy in a female body, despite witnessing Ranma's transformation several times—he merely believes that Ranma has switched places with her in some manner. He once hears her called by Ranma's name, and attempts to write it down for future reference. Despite this, he never makes a connection and continues to refer to \\"her\\" as his \\"goddess in pigtails\\", or \\"the pigtailed girl\\" for the entire series. Akane's sister Nabiki often sells him photographs of \\"the pigtailed girl\\" in various states of undress. He also has a strong rivalry with Kodachi, who similarly has a crush on male Ranma (and much like her brother refuses to believe that Ranma and the pigtailed girl are the same person), often leading to confrontations between the siblings. Unlike Kodachi, Kuno doesn't actually behave in any malicious way, and although he's a buffoon and extremely forward with the girls he likes, he is shown to be traditionally courteous. As captain of the kendo team, Tatewaki was the school's most powerful warrior before Ranma's arrival. Despite constant defeats at Ranma's hands, he is always confident in his abilities, believing himself to be incapable of losing. Though he is initially no match for Ranma, after losing his memory for a time, he shows the potential to become far stronger. With his sword, he is very powerful, able to create \\"air pressure strikes\\" easily capable of destroying a stone pillar, and he later becomes able to spin rapidly, which creates a constant barrage of the strikes and makes his defense nearly impenetrable. The cheerleader Mariko Konjo has a rather large crush on him, and calls Kuno her \\"first love\\". =Kodachi Kuno= Voiced by: Saeko Shimazu (Japanese); Teryl Rothery (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 1-4), Erin Fitzgerald (English, Viz Media dub; season 5), Sylvia Zaradic (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 6-7), Candice Moore (English; Animax Asia dub); Julia Haacke (German); Rocio Prado (Spanish) is the captain of the gymnastics team of the St. Hebereke School for Girls, who is referred to as \\"The Black Rose\\" (in Japanese, Kurobara no Kodachi), apparently due to her signature theatrical style of exiting a scene by leaving behind a swirling trail of black roses accompanied by high-octave laughter. She is an expert in Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics, making her skilled in acrobatics and the use of balls, clubs, hoops, ribbons, and ropes as weapons. She is very agile, and she is not averse to using unorthodox methods in combat such as rigged weapons, explosives and various poisons. She attacks other people prior to competitions in order to win by default, which she calls \\"fighting in all fairness before the match.\\" She becomes enamored with Ranma after he saved her from a fall, and attempts to make him hers at any cost. She also hates Ranma's female form, believing \\"her\\" to be a rival for Ranma, while her brother Tatewaki hates the male form, which is a frequent source of conflict between them. She is a good cook who prepares elaborate meals, and she often uses culinary expertise to her advantage by placing poisons, toxins, serums, and other strange substances in her victims' food to attain something she wants from them. Kodachi is considered the most malicious of Ranma's fiancees and although she is shown in less occasions than Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo, her personality and methods make her the most dangerous of the four. She is shown to have a skewed version of what would make Ranma happy; she is considered to be pursuing Ranma mostly out of personal vanity, as she does not show to be particularly interested in his happiness or well being. =Principal Kuno= Voiced by: Tatsuyuki Jinnai (Japanese); Scott McNeil (English; Viz Media dub); Carlos Del Campo (Spanish) is the Kuno siblings' long lost father and the principal at Akane and Ranma's school. He is obsessed with Hawaiian culture, generally wears a lei and an aloha shirt, and speaks with a Hawaiian accent. His disappearance and subsequent return is explained in the manga as being part of a study trip to learn the teaching methods used in America. On his return from Hawaii, his first action is to attempt to force standard haircuts on all students (buzz cuts for boys, bowl cuts for girls), which begins a rivalry between the Principal and Ranma Saotome. Principal Kuno is the only person to ever appear in Ranma 1/2 wearing a baseball uniform. He is gleefully devoted to making the lives of all the students at his school as miserable as possible and seems to enjoy their derision, though he likes to pick on Ranma in particular. =Sasuke Sarugakure= Voiced by: Shigeru Chiba (Japanese); Robert O Smith (English; Viz Media dub); Patrick Borg (French); Herman Lopez (Spanish) is the Kuno family's house ninja. Sasuke is a loyal servant and often tries to help Tatewaki defeat Ranma and steal Akane away from him. Despite his loyalty, Sasuke sometimes receives harsh treatment by Tatewaki. He has to live in poor conditions with minimal food and very little shelter or comforts. Sasuke is exclusive to the anime, and takes over many of Hikaru Gosunkugi's parts before that character is introduced later in the anime. Other Japanese characters =Ryoga Hibiki= Voiced by: Koichi Yamadera (Japanese); Michael Donovan (English; Viz Media dub), Dave Bridges (English; Animax Asia dub); Patrick Borg (French); Daniel Schlauch (German); Riccardo Rossi (Italian); Wendel Bezerra (Portuguese) is Ranma's long-time primary rival, and the only one the latter has stated to truly consider as such. He has no sense of direction and is always lost on long strenuous journeys - traits he inherited from his parents. This caused him to be four days late for a duel he and Ranma had planned to fight, and Ranma left on the third day. After spending months looking for male Ranma to have the belated duel, Ryoga finally ends up at Jusenkyo in China, but is pushed into a cursed spring by female Ranma (while chasing Genma and not looking where she was going). Ever since then Ryoga turns into a black piglet when doused with cold water, which makes his constant wanderings much more dangerous from hungry hunters and predators, and he initially carries a large grudge at Ranma for that once he learned the truth. Ryoga is the first major challenge to Ranma in Nerima. Their first fight showcases their strengths, and it is a close match. Akane accidentally discovers Ryoga in cursed form, and not knowing the pig's true identity, adopts him as her pet and names him . She is the first person to show him real kindness, and Ryoga falls head-over-heels in love with her, and consistently acts as a fierce protector from both real and imagined threats, whether in normal or cursed form. She even takes him to bed with her, and generally beats him severely with her sleep-movements. Ryoga accepts training from Cologne because he feels that he can use it to best Ranma, and win Akane's interest. Cologne is equally using Ryoga, hoping to remove Akane from the picture, which would in turn free Ranma to wed Shampoo. His training under Cologne makes Ryoga's body tremendously durable. He toughens even to the point that great impacts, such as being buried in a rockslide, or being repeatedly struck with large boulders, cause no visible damage. Engaging Ranma for a second time, he forces Ranma to also rely on training from Cologne, used in an inventive manner, to counter his newly toughened constitution. When not upset Ryoga is usually shy, humble, helpful, and polite, especially around women. He tends to stock up on an assortments of gifts and local food specialties from the highly diverse locations where he ends up during his travels. Ryoga is also shown to have a chivalrous streak, and consistently protects any maidens in distress, or victims of bullies, monsters, or bandits that he comes across, and is sometimes emotional enough to be brought to tears from compassion, including for Ranma. However, he also recurrently tends to be led more by impulse and emotions than common sense, is prone to anger and misunderstandings, and although he is generally more considerate and naive than Ranma, and needs considerably stronger reasons to turn petty and spiteful, when sufficiently pressed he has displayed a few more ruthless moments than his rival seems capable of. Ryoga is largely clumsy with his own strength when he is not engaging in combat, often going through walls and destroying property whenever he feels embarrassed. Ranma often takes advantage of Ryoga's good nature: Ryoga is utterly incapable of seeing through a lady in disguise (mostly Ranma), though this is not a unique trait in him, as Shampoo and Ukyo have also used (blatantly obvious) disguises on other people with success. Ryoga's grudge towards Ranma for causing his second curse eventually disappears, and is replaced with a professional rivalry. This morphs into something of a mutual respect in the later story arcs, and Ryoga comes to save Ranma's and/or Akane's lives more times than the reverse. However, he remains annoyed with Ranma for recurrently arguing with Akane or manipulating him, and their mutual battle prowess competition will likely persist forever. In the late part of the manga series Ryoga's affection for Akane starts to shift towards the sumo- pig breeder Akari, who becomes his girlfriend. Ryoga is one of the first characters to use Ki-projection as a means to combat Ranma. His ki attack is named the \\"Shi Shi Hokodan\\", or \\"Lion's Roar Shot\\", which in the anime is inconsistently displayed as either a green or red globe, alternately a beam, of energy. He taps into his reservoirs through the weight of feelings of depression, loneliness, frustration, pain, anger, hopelessness, and likely determination, to blasts an opponent with a vertical ray of pent up personal energy. Although Ranma does learn the same technique, his personality is much more suited to using emotions of confidence and arrogance, naming his own technique \\"Moko Takabisha\\". Ryoga further refines the technique, but the \\"Shin Shi Shi Hokodan\\" or complete form of the attack requires extreme levels of despair and projects Ki in a towering pillar, which then crashes down, pulverizing his opponent. Ryoga uses the final version of this technique while being strangled by Lime. His sorrow at the prospect of dying without being loved by Akane causes him to produce a powerful chi-attack that defeats Lime in a single strike, and causes the Musk dragon-prince Herb to wake up (due to the energy output) and feel awed by the display. By the end of the manga series Ryoga spends his time wandering through the wilderness, attempting to find, and go on innocent dates with, his pig-breeding girlfriend, while striving to get over his old crush on Akane, and as usual, likely training and amassing new techniques to exceed Ranma — if he can ever find his friend and nemesis. =Ukyo Kuonji= Voiced by: Hiromi Tsuru (Japanese); Kelly Sheridan (English; Viz Media dub), Candice Moore (English; Animax Asia dub); Anna Carlsson (German); Francesca Fiorentini (Italian); Gaby Willer (Spanish) an okonomiyaki chef and a childhood friend of Ranma. Ten years prior to the manga's beginning, she met Ranma during a training voyage to the country with Genma. Her father proposed an arranged marriage to Ranma, who was unaware that she was a girl, with his okonomiyaki cart acting as the dowry, to which Genma agreed. But when an oblivious Ranma said he liked okonomiyaki more than Ukyo, Genma stole the cart, breaking the engagement and leaving her behind. Shamed and ridiculed by her peers for not being feminine enough to keep her fiancé, she gave up her femininity and decided she wouldn't like boys. She dressed and lived as one, even attending an all-boys school at one point. During this time, she devoted herself to okonomiyaki-style martial arts to prepare to exact revenge on the Saotomes. She later resurfaces at Ranma's school, and after a heated battle, he discovers her true gender. He calls her \\"cute\\", and she learns that he does not seem to get along with his \\"uncute\\" fiancée Akane. As a result, she reconciles with Ranma and attempts to reestablish their engagement. She calls him \\"Ran-chan\\" (occasionally dubbed as \\"Ranma-honey\\" in the English version), while he calls her \\"Ucchan\\". Ranma still treats her only as an old friend, but unlike those of his other suitors, her plots to win him over have been mostly non-violent and considerably more effective. Despite this, she can turn underhanded and occasionally ambushes those she believes to be her romantic rivals. In addition, she has been willing to give up her house and restaurant, or rescind her craft for Ranma's sake, if it would mean that they could be together. Ukyo and Shampoo are shown as more bitter rivals than any of the two towards Akane, and are constantly at each other's throats. Though she is not above hurting Ranma either, she usually does it justifiably but not measuring her own strength. Unlike the other suitors, Ukyo is at better odds regarding Akane, as they are rivals but cautious friends; she has even lived at the Tendo Dojo for a while and is considered worthy of help from both Ranma and Akane at her okonomiyaki restaurant. Apart from Akane, Ukyo is the only alternative suitor to Ranma that goes to his same school and is also his classmate. Ukyo's style of fighting is a legacy style from her father based on their food preparation, and reminiscent of ninja patterns. She uses food-based techniques to stun, restrain or confuse opponents, as well as a chi-infused \\"batter dragon\\", which fuses her techniques into one. She also uses a large spatula as a two handed weapon and has a bandolier of smaller spatulas she uses as projectiles. She is strong, swift, skilled, agile, and has a versatile range of attacks. =Happosai= Voiced by: Ichiro Nagai (Japanese); Paul Dobson (English; Viz Media dub), Victor Lee (English; Animax Asia dub); Serge Bourrier (French); Hwan-Jin Kim (Korean); Osman Ragheb (Spanish) is the founder and grandmaster of . He often alternates between his role as a villainous grandmaster to one as a lighthearted pervert. As a hedonistic short, old man, he openly makes perverse activities his proud hobbies (much to the shame of his own disciples), committing indecencies willfully such as groping women, peeping at women bathing or undressing, and stealing lingerie (he is often found carrying a big sack of lingerie leaping from house to house). He goes into withdrawals if he is unable to participate in such activities, which causes him to almost die at one point. He attempts to model himself as a former ladykiller, but in reality, he was turned down by every woman in the Amazon village, including Cologne, during his youth. He is also sadistic and vengeful, with instances that include using his two students, Genma and Soun, as slaves and attempting to cripple Ranma for life by taking away his strength. Nevertheless, considering that both Soun and Genma have shown themselves to be powerful Martial Artists, have displayed abilities similar to Happosai, coupled with that their master returned to the Tendo Dojo to train either of them as an official heir to his school, this implies that Happosai did afford Soun and Genma at least some advanced training (though evidently nowhere near enough to outweigh all the injustices he dealt them). Despite his small stature and age, Happosai is arguably, by far, the most powerful known martial artist in the entire series. Even without employing special techniques, he is able to effortlessly defeat Ranma, Ryoga, Genma and Soun combined within seconds, or overpower Taro's monster form with a single finger. His defining and most often employed weapons are cannonball- like fuse bombs, ranging from regular to small house-sized, which he can seemingly instantly conjure out of nowhere when needed. He possesses knowledge in ancient martial arts techniques, near-forgotten pressure points on a human body, recipes for alchemical concoctions with various effects, and knowledge of many Chinese and Japanese magical artifacts. Other techniques include turning his body substance similar to air for invisibility, chi-blasts, momentum negation or redirection, and crippling fear generation. He has an enormously powerful large skyscraper-sized battle-aura (looking like a giant version of himself), which allows him to increase the scale of his fighting to great kaiju proportions for prolonged periods of time, and pushes him far out of the league of virtually any other character. Ranma and his fellow fighters have wisely optioned to simply stay out of sight and run for their lives on the rare occasion when the grandmaster has been in this mode. His main weaknesses are that he is seldom remotely serious and he is susceptible to sucker-attacks while he is distracted by lingerie and women. Happosai is shown to be a frequent foe to most of the cast, though he mostly plots against them if he feels that they have been disrespectful toward him (especially if they don't indulge him in his twisted needs). Even when he is shown to be not behaving maliciously, his actions and intervention always result in grave consequences. One example of this is Hinako Ninomiya (Ranma's teacher), whose life was saved by Happosai by teaching her a technique that allows her to absorb battle auras. She briefly became a foe to Ranma and his classmates as she was considered extremely dangerous before the two of them came to terms. =Hinako Ninomiya= Voiced by: Yumi Toma (Japanese); Janyse Jaud (English; Viz Media dub) is a teacher hired by Principal Kuno for the purpose of disciplining Furinkan High's many delinquent students, particularly Ranma. She has a reputation for being a very successful reformer, though her childlike body causes surprise. She was very sickly as a child. While she was in the hospital, Happosai rearranged her metabolism to allow her to absorb the auras of others to increase her health, though his reason for doing so was to allow him to escape enraged nurses, whose panties he had stolen, by having her absorb their auras. Her body ages much more slowly than other people due to the altered metabolism, so she still has the body of a child despite being an adult. After absorbing a person's aura, her body becomes that of an adult, and she can then fire the energy back at her opponent, though she also returns to her actual form. The ability can be countered by pressing five specific pressure points, and it can be removed by doing so every day for a month, though the action makes the attacker look like a molester, as it forces them to grab her left breast, so Ranma gives up on the idea. While in her child form, she generally acts immature, and in her adult form, she acts as an elegant, somewhat vain adult woman, though either form always enjoys sweets, attractions, and video games, eats like a slob, and does not take care of her apartment. Hinako is obsessed with enforcing discipline at Furinkan High, and she will do so at any moment if she feels someone is being a delinquent. Her primary target in this endeavor has been Ranma, whom she wishes to take care of so that everyone else will fall in line. Even so, her dedication to teaching also means she wants him to succeed in her classes, and has made an effort to help him with his studies. She is in love with Soun Tendo, and, despite his rejection, is always in pursuit to marry him. Hinako's only anime appearances have been in one episode of the 1990s OVA series and in the 2008 Nightmare! Incense of Spring Sleep OVA. =Hikaru Gosunkugi= Voiced by: Issei Futamata (Japanese); Michael Benyaer (English; Viz Media dub), Dave Bridges (English; Animax Asia dub); Marco Vivio (Italian); Carlos Íñigo (Spanish) Portrayed by: Yuta Kanai is an unpopular student in Akane and Ranma's class. He is desperately in love with Akane, and tries to get rid of Ranma by using extraordinary items, or his non-existent voodoo abilities. Due to the large strength gap between them, Ranma is largely oblivious of Gosunkugi's enmity towards him. Hikaru has a much larger part in the manga than in the anime, where he does not appear until the sixth season. The character of Sasuke Sarugakure, the Kuno family ninja, was invented to take most of the parts that Hikaru originally performed. =Tofu Ono= Voiced by: Yuji Mitsuya (Japanese); Ian James Corlett (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 1-5), Kirby Morrow (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 6-7); Patrick Borg (French); Hubertus Von Lerchenfeld (German); Jorge Ornelas (Spanish) Portrayed by: Shosuke Tanihara Dr. is a chiropractor who runs a moxibustion and acupuncture clinic in Nerima. His office is located near the Tendo dojo. He has known their family for a long time. In addition to his medical skills, he is very knowledgeable about martial arts techniques. He uses his knowledge of pressure points and other medicine to help Ranma and the others. He is hopelessly in love with Kasumi. Whenever he sees her, his glasses fog up and he becomes nervous, losing the ability to focus on what he is doing, which can prove dangerous for any patient he may be treating at the moment. Kasumi is completely oblivious to the effect she has on him, dismissing any of his unusual actions, presumably because she has never seen him act differently. In a similar manner, Dr. Tofu was unaware of the crush Akane had on him at the series' beginning; he was the reason she grew her hair long. She gave up on him after her hair was cut short in a freak accident. For a time, he employed both Genma and Shampoo as assistants. He all but disappeared from the cast after the moxibustion manga arc. =Konatsu= is a male ninja raised as a female kunoichi, and in this respect is described as a genius that is born only once every one hundred years. He was raised by his cruel stepmother and stepsisters, who treated him like a slave after the death of his father. Like Ukyo's other suitor Tsubasa Kurenai, his face and body appear feminine when fully clothed. He generally wears female battle attire and casual clothing, speaks and acts like humble and subservient Japanese woman, and is generally quite shy. He has feelings for Ukyo Kuonji, though they go unanswered. He is happy to dress in male clothing to help attract customers to her restaurant, though the outfits are generally overly decorated. He uses trickery and traps in battle, and often utilizes shuriken, smoke bombs, in his hands lethal (cheap) paper swords, a whirlwind of paper bills, and the \\"Duplicating Body Technique\\", which allows him to create up to four doubles, though he has not used it in battle. When Konatsu is fighting full force he is more than Ranma can handle while holding back in the no-damage manner used to incapacitate most female fighters, but he does not appear to be as formidable as Ranma, Ryoga, Ryu, or Mousse when they are trying hard. Konatsu does not appear in the anime version. =Akari Unryu= comes from a long line of trainers who raise and train pigs for sumo-type fighting. Akari loves pigs, and their potential strength as warriors. Her favorite, Katsunishiki, is one of the best in the country and her grandfather states that only someone who can defeat it in battle is worthy to marry Akari. Ryoga defeats it, which causes Akari to fall in love with him, and she falls for him even more after finding out that his curse transforms him into a small pig. Due to a misunderstanding, she once attempts to learn to hate pigs to appease him, but she is unable to do so. She understands his poor sense of direction and provides him with a map to his destination before their dates. She does not appear in the anime version. =Tsubasa Kurenai= Voiced by: Eiko Yamada (Japanese); Saffron Henderson (English; Viz Media dub); Gabriel Chavez (Spanish) is a minor antagonist who serves as master of disguise, often dressing up as various inanimate objects or plants. He also constantly dresses up like a girl and has a girlish (but obnoxious) personality to match, which causes confusion to anyone he meets. He has been in love with Ukyo Kuonji since they went to school together, and is thus jealous of Ranma, who he believes to have stolen Ukyo. He later attempts to date Ranma's female form, but Ranma, thinking Tsubasa to be female, attempts to set him up with his male form because he feels sorry for Tsubasa. Ranma eventually learns that Tsubasa is a male, which leads to violence. Tsubasa is not a trained martial artist, but he has proven to possess strength ample enough to roughhouse Ranma, and he can still cause trouble with his ridiculous tactics and unpredictability. He most commonly disguises himself as a mailbox, but also often poses as Ucchan's Okonomiyaki sign (in order to watch Ukyo), a tree, a trash can, a barrel, and various other objects. =The Golden Pair= Azusa Shiratori voiced by: Naoko Matsui (Japanese); Cathy Weseluck (English; Viz Media dub) Mikado Sanzenin voiced by: Kazuhiko Inoue (Japanese); Ian James Corlett (English; Viz Media dub); Francesco Bucklaen (Italian); Gerardo Reyero (Spanish) and are a pair of martial-arts-ice-skaters known as The Golden Pair. Azusa is bratty and compulsively kleptomaniac. Often, when she finds cute things, she gives them equally cute names and takes them home, even if they clearly do not belong to her. She meets any person attempting to stop her from doing so with violence. Mikado, her partner and classic playboy, in particular is often the target of her assaults with blunt objects. Azusa comes into conflict with Akane by apprehending the latter's pet piglet P-chan, and renaming it to \\"Charlotte\\". When Akane wants it back, Azusa challenges her to a match to determine the rightful owner. Mikado earns a corresponding challenge from Ranma by trying to steal a kiss from Akane's lips, and later earns his full fury, by kissing Ranma's female form. Despite Ranma's lack of skating skill, Mikado is narrowly bested in personal combat during a fight on skates. The official showdown, called the Charlotte Cup, turns into a long, hard, three-way battle between The Golden Pair and their frequently distracted and shifting opponents Ranma, Akane and Ryoga. In the manga, they only appear once, but they have a cameo appearance in the first movie. And Azusa has an additional appearance in an episode of the TV series. There she takes Tatewaki and Sasuke as two of her cute playthings. =Ryu Kumon= Voiced by: Misturu Miyamoto (Japanese) is a wandering martial artist and master of the Yamasenken. When he was 6 years old, he and his father were a very poor family that owned the shoddy Kumon Dojo. One day Ryu's father had an encounter with Genma Saotome. After Genma found out about the Kumons' financial problems, he gave Ryu's father a scroll containing the techniques of the deadly secret art of Yamasenken, a.k.a. Fist of One Thousand Mountains. This led Ryu's father to believe he could use the Yamasenken to restore his dojo, but when he practiced its attacks indoors he ended up destroying the building, causing it to fall on top of him which led to his death. With his last moments of life, he gave Ryu the scroll and told him to find the scroll containing the companion Umisenken. Since then Ryu has traveled alone without any family or friends part of which has led to his harsh and unscrupulous nature. Ten years later, he comes across Genma's wife Nodoka, when saving her from a rampaging bear, she tells him that he is her long lost son, Ranma, since the scroll he is carrying has Ranma's name written on it. While somewhat surprised by his coincidental good fortune in encountering the wife of Genma, Ryu immediately takes the opportunity to play along, in order to find the Umisenken scroll, and takes up residence within her house. Ranma discovers that Ryu is misleading his mother, and after being beaten and threatened to be exposed if he interfered, decides to learn the stealthy Umisenken technique from his father, which is developed as a direct counter to the brutal and powerful Yamasenken. Once Ranma mastered the Umisenken, he finally managed to defeat Ryu after a harsh and difficult battle. =Shinnosuke= Voiced by: Takeshi Kusao (Japanese); Jason Gray-Stanford (English; Viz Media dub); Marco Baroni (Italian) and his grandfather both live in the forest of Ryugenzawa, where they protect the local villagers from the giant animals that they once kept as pets. Years ago when Akane was vacationing with her family in Ryugenzawa, she got lost in the forest and was attacked by a giant platypus. However she was saved by Shinnosuke. Some time later, when Shinnosuke was near death after being scratched by the platypus's venomous claws, his grandfather took some of the Water of Life and fed it to Shinnosuke. Shinnosuke survived, but developed a dependency on the Water of Life. Years later, in the present, Akane once again hears about the forest of Ryugenzawa in a television advertisement asking for help in combating the increasing numbers of monsters and remembers Shinnosuke saving her. In an attempt to pay back Shinnosuke, Akane travels to Ryugenzawa to find him. In the process, Akane is attacked by a giant creature, and is saved, just like when she was young, by Shinnosuke, who still bears the marks on his back. Although he is now very forgetful, Shinnosuke invites Akane to stay with him and his grandfather. Akane later cures Shinnosuke of his dependency on the water of life by applying a special moss to his back. Shinnosuke is voiced by Takeshi Kusao in the Japanese anime and Jason Gray-Stanford in English. He later develops a crush on Akane. =Mariko Konjo= Voiced by: Yuko Kobayashi (Japanese); Jocelyn Loewen (English; Viz Media dub) is a minor antagonist who serves as the captain of the Seisyun High School cheerleading team. They assault opposing teams by throwing their cheerleading materials. She instantly develops feelings for Kuno after he lands on her, and she believes that female Ranma is trying to steal him away. She often speaks in rhymes or spells out words in normal conversation. Mariko enthusiastically uses \\"Martial Arts Cheerleading\\", an unscrupulous tactic meant to injure other teams, and make her team invincible. Like several other characters virtually everything Mariko does is a gag or parody, in her case with Valley Girl speak and cheerleading motifs. She creates various extravagant displays with the theme of \\"love\\" in the name, such as Love Confession Pom-Pom Fireworks, Love Boomerang, and Innocent Girl Love Letter Blast, but also has surprisingly efficient oddball special attacks and fighting-skills. She uses her cheerleading tools to attack opponents, such as using batons as bludgeons, or throwing them with incredible stealth and accuracy, to knock out an opposing team without notice, whether directly or through ricochets. She also has a version that can extend to many times its original length. Other attacks include multiple shredding \\"razor-pom-poms\\", and strong (miniskirt-wearing) flying kicks. She proved to be a stronger opponent than either Shampoo or Ukyo, and actually managed to momentarily defeat Ranma with an unexpected staff strike to the jugular. Other Chinese characters =Pantyhose Taro= Voiced by: Shinnosuke Furumoto (Japanese); Matt Hill (English; Viz Media dub) is a young martial artist, depicted as an antagonist, who is born in Jusenkyo. Happosai helps his mother with the birth, and accidentally bathes him in the most accursed spring in the area, and because of the customs of the village, Happosai also names him. His cursed form is a chimera resembling either a stereotypical demon or minotaur, with small crane wings which allow him to fly great distances despite his enormous size, and an eel sticking out of his lower back which works as a second set of eyes for Taro during combat. He later integrates an octopus curse to gain a set of tentacles, as well as an ink-blast, which he uses to constrict or confuse his enemies. While others hate their cursed forms, he takes pride in the form's strength and durability in battle, which both considerably exceed that of Ranma himself. However, Taro intensely despises and feels ashamed of his name, wishing to take the name \\"Awesome Taro\\", or something similarly impressive-sounding, but the only way to change it by local custom is to have Happosai agree, although he refuses unless it is something other lingerie- related. Taro is highly ruthless and power-hungry. He's generally dishonorable and often cheats and betrays during confrontations, but will help beautiful women who are in trouble. He's not used to being helped, and generally gives disdainful remarks as thanks for offered aid. Taro is especially intolerant of Ranma, whom he hates because Ranma calls him \\"Pantyhose-guy\\", and tends to respond with \\"cowardly okama\\", \\"crossdressing/transgender freak\\", or similar derogatory epitets. Perhaps to remind himself of the shame his moniker brings, he wears a pair of pantyhose around his waist like a belt. He has also stated a goal to \\"take over the world\\", but seems very clueless in this endeavor. In human form Taro had a certain disadvantage to Ranma during their first confrontation, but his similar tendency to provoke and fight dirty enabled him to gain an edge during their second fight. However, he has not displayed any repertoire of special techniques, has recently been more interested in finding ways to enhance his cursed form than training to increase his skill, and does not appear to be as cunning as a chimera. =Jusenkyo Guide= Voiced by: Koichi Yamadera (Japanese); Ian James Corlett (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 1-5), Michael Donovan (English, Viz Media dub; seasons 6-7); Kai Taschner (German); Martin Soto (Spanish), Javier Roldan (Spanish) The Jusenkyo Guide is a tourist guide at the training ground of cursed springs at Jusenkyo. He usually warns anyone that comes there that they should not train there or they will fall under a grave curse but never actually interferes with their decisions. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the hundreds of pools throughout the area, knowing their names, when they became cursed, and the \\"tragic story\\" behind each of them. He is also in charge of the guest registry that Pantyhose Taro later uses to track down all the victims of the Jusenkyo curses. He is often helpful to anyone who visits and tries to offer whatever help he can. Unfortunately, he is not very efficacious, and usually informs the unfortunate cursed victim too late about the curse that has fallen on them. Despite his efforts, nearly every character who comes to the springs ends up cursed. The Guide is also an expert on the local area, being knowledgeable about the Chinese Amazons and their customs. The Guide has a young daughter named Plum. He also mentioned having a wife, but she is never seen. =Plum= Plum is the daughter of the Jusenkyo Guide, who appears in the final arc of the manga. When Saffron's people capture her father and start strangling the flow of the Jusenkyo springs, she travels to Japan to warn Ranma, Ryoga, Genma, Shampoo, Mousse and Cologne, and later guides them in the trip to Jusenkyo. Even though Plum is only a little girl, she is fairly intelligent, reasonable and brave, providing Ranma and his friends with useful information about the springs and following them even in dangerous situations. =Rouge= Rouge is a girl from Shanghai, China, who holds a grudge against Pantyhose Taro for stealing the \\"source of her power.\\" She is presented as generally \\"overfeminine\\", being vain, shy, melodramatic, sensitive to the point of easily fainting when mentally exhausted, and fond of superstitions, such as astrology and blood groups. However, she is also violently vengeful when upset, and mostly disregards any damage she causes as a \\"bad omen\\". She is able to transform into an Asura, which grants her six arms, three faces with independent minds, and great strength. In this state her personality is rather turned \\"overmasculine\\", loving to eat, fight, blow things up, and apparently possessing few other interests. The \\"Asura\\" form can create lightning storms, or small flaming rocks from her hands, sheathe her body in protective fire, and manifest a turbulent revolving inferno (literal \\"fire storm\\"), as well as emit a blinding flash of light. She is susceptible to physical attacks, and her mind is split in three parts that recurrently have different ideas of what to do, but her tendency to hover far away and attack from a distance makes her a difficult opponent. She later learns that her \\"power sources\\" are actually magnetic disks used to prevent stiffening in one's back, which is a problem for her cursed form. Rouge does not appear in the anime. =Herb= is a member of the Musk Dynasty, an ancient community of Chinese martial arts devoted to transforming animals into humans using a cursed spring and breeding with them in order to produce heirs with bolstered genetic fighting potential. Herb is part of the royal line, which is descended from dragons, granting him chi-mastery. He is raised without female contact, as is every other male, and before being married, he attempts to use a spring to familiarize himself with women by transforming a monkey. Distracted by breasts, he accidentally falls into the spring and becomes trapped in a female form. He and his two servants, Mint and Lime, attempt to find an artifact to reverse the effect. Herb is ruthless and irate, showing little respect for the worth of anyone beyond himself. Due to his experience with the monkey that cursed him, Herb possesses an irrational hatred towards female breasts, and he is easily distracted and enraged by the sight of them. Herb is an immensely skilled martial artist, who has consistently outmatched Ranma in direct combat. He believes himself to be a complete master of manipulating chi, though he is easily surprised by unknown attacks. He has the ability to fly, use supersonic strikes, multiple flexible chi blasts, a sword made from chi, and flying blades of chi, as well as the Amazon Hiryu Shoten Ha technique, which uses the power of an opponent to fuel a tornado. He is voiced by Katsuaki Arima. Herb's two main, fearsome and ruthless, but naive and inexperienced, bodyguards are named Lime (Rimu) and Mint (Minte). Lime is of the tiger-clan, a massive master warrior dressed in animal skins, and the physically strongest and most durable character in the series, dwarfing even Ryoga in these areas, with an upper maximum of over 100,000 tonnes. Mint looks like a short young man, but is part wolf, wears the skin of one over his head, is a master swordsman, and the swiftest character in the series, more than a match for Mousse even when the latter goes all out, and utilises a limited number of throwing knives, but is easily distracted. However, although physically superior to Herb they have not displayed any special techniques. =Saffron = Saffron is a humanoid phoenix, ruling over a tribe of bird- human hybrids transformed from the waters of the cursed springs. He is the main foe of the final arc of the manga. He attempts to use the waters to become an adult and provide heat and light for his people, but the process strangles the flow of the springs, which means that others cursed by the springs have no means to cure themselves. He is selfish and territorial, and only cares for his own people. He tends to be cold and condescending even towards those who treat him with kindness and loyalty. Saffron has mastery over fire, allowing him to use a number of attacks related to it, up to a gigantic fireball capable of vaporising several mountaintops in its path, making it the most powerful attack in the series. Saffron is able to fly, and is skilled with the Kinjakan, an ancient weapon of his people. He can rapidly heal missing limbs, and he is reborn as an infant after violent deaths, but can be beaten unconscious by severe blunt impacts, and his physical defenses are very low due to being pampered since birth. This character is the second on the manga that bears the Saffron name; on a previous arc of the manga, there is a Chinese girl named Saffron who is saved by Pantyhose Taro on a very brief encounter. Saffron's main servants, beyond his chamberlain, are Kiima, Koruma, and Masala (like himself given pun names sounding identical to spices or spicy dishes, similar to the Musk being named after herbs, and other rural Chinese from female beauty accessories). Kiima is part seabird, the loyal, crafty, proud, haughty, and petty captain of his guard, as well as an expert swordswoman, spy, and seductress. She is capable of flight; using an extremely lethal, mystically enforced metal-slicing, multiple \\"razor-feather\\" discharge; communicating with birds or commanding large throngs to perform complex tasks across continents, such as information-gathering, retrievals, or abductions; using surikomi/imprinting eggs to ambush, brainwash, and enslave opponents to turn on their own; or various Jusenkyo water to transform into female human disguises (her latest being a copy of Akane Tendo). Her weaknesses are that she has limited unarmed combat skills, turns human from cold water, and cannot fly in times of rain. Shampoo intensely hates her due to the humiliation of enslavement, and is shown subduing Kiima in combat while Ranma fights Saffron. Koruma and Masala are Kiima's loyal, dedicated, and easily impressed part crow young bodyguards and handymen. They are stronger and apparently much more dangerous hand-to-hand fighters than herself, are similarly capable of flight as long as they avoid cold water, and can use weaker versions of her feather attack, but are easily confused and dependent on her guidance. Kiima enjoys keeping them around for flattery. =Maomolin= is a 3000 year old ghost cat who always searches for a wife. Reception Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Bamboo Dong compliments Takahashi's character designs as being \\"easily recognizable\\", but laments that \\"everyone looks largely the same\\", with polar facial expressions and eyebrows, which \\"seem to always be in a state of unnatural anguish\\", while \\"the different age groups are lumped under the same stature and facial types.\\" Also writing for ANN, Carlo Santos disagrees, praising the series' \\"iconic character designs\\" for their \\"great facial expressions\\" and \\"distinctive features\\", which \\"always make it easy to tell who's who\\".

Specifically, high conservation value forests are those that possess one or more of the following attributes: # forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant: concentrations of biodiversity values (e.g. endemism, endangered species, refugia); and/or large landscape-level forests, contained within, or containing the management unit, where viable populations of most if not all naturally occurring species exist in natural patterns of distribution and abundance # forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems # forest areas that provide basic services of nature in critical situations (e.g. watershed protection, erosion control) # forest areas fundamental to meeting basic needs of local communities (e.g. subsistence, health) and/or critical to local communities' traditional cultural identity (areas of cultural, ecological, economic or religious significance identified in cooperation with such local communities).FSC-STD-01-001 (April 2004) History The arose relatively recently in connection with the development of standards for the certification of forest management. The term was developed by the Forest Stewardship Council, A.C. (FSC), which is an international accreditation association1 incorporated in 1995. The FSC first started considering the term high conservation values in 1996 T.J. Synnott. 2005. Some notes on the early years of FSC. Saltillo, Mexico, 19 November. 54 pp. and formally included the term high conservation value forests in the FSC Principles and Criteria of Forest Stewardship in January 1999. A number of terms have been used somewhat interchangeably with the term HCVF. To a certain extent this arises from translation between languages and to a certain extent it arises from varying approaches at interpretation. The Spanish version uses the terms bosques con alto valor de conservación (forests with high value of conservation) and bosques con alto valor para la conservación (forests with high value for conservation). As noted, the term HCVF arose following consideration of the term high conservation values; this usage led to the concept of forests having high conservation values and forests with high conservation values. Indeed, the term high conservation value is sometimes given its own acronym HCV; however, the FSC refers to an HCV as \\"attributes\\". Examples Examples of the large landscape globally important forests include the Canada boreal forest and the remaining Amazon rainforest. Examples of forest types which embrace rare or endangered species include the Dry deciduous forests of Madagascar the two Monterey Cypress of central coastal CaliforniaC.Michael Hogan and Michael P. Frankis. 2009. Monterey Cypress: Cupressus macrocarpa, GlobalTwitcher.com ed. N. Stromberg and the Maritime Coast Range Ponderosa Pine forests of coastal California. HCVF Toolkits Following the inclusion of the term in the FSC P&C; in 1999, the FSC formed an Advisory Panel for the Implementation of high conservation value forests and the precautionary principle. This panel produced a number of consultation documents on how to identify HCVF, including indicators and verifiers. However, this consultation process was not finalized and FSC has yet to issue any specific guidance regarding HCVF1. In lieu of formal guidance from FSC, there has been a proliferation of discussion on HCVF, led mainly by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In particular, the need for more precise and practical guidance led to a 2001 initiative by the UK-based consulting company, Proforest Ltd. This initiative led to the production of a three-part High Conservation Value Toolkit (the ‘Global Toolkit’).S. Jennings, R. Nussbaum, N. Judd and T. Evans. 2003. The High Conservation Value Forest Tool Kit. ProForest, Oxford, UK. The Global Toolkit offered a revised definition of HCVF as follows: A High Conservation Value Forest is the area of forest required to maintain or enhance a High Conservation Value. This definition provides a new approach to the zonation of HCVF as well as introduces the concept of ‘High Conservation Value’. The inclusion of the term ‘area of forest’ provide clarity that there may be instances where an HCVF zone might be restricted to part of a forest, while the FSC definition implied that the presence of one or more HCV attribute would render the whole forest as to be a ‘high conservation value forest’. Indeed, despite the provision for partial zonation, the Global Toolkit makes it clear that for the purposes of certification, any forest management unit containing even one small HCV is classified as a High Conservation Value Forest, which brings into play extra requirements for consultation, maintenance or enhancement, and annual monitoring. However, the additional burden is determined by the nature of the HCV and will affect only those parts of the forest, and those aspects of management, that are required for the maintenance or enhancement of the HCV (this procedure is explained in more detail in the section on Adaptive Management, below). There are six recognized forms of High conservation values forests: :HCV1. Forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant concentrations of biodiversity values (e.g. endemism, endangered species, refugia). :HCV2. Forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant large landscape level forests, contained within, or containing the management unit, where viable populations of most if not all naturally occurring species exist in natural patterns of distribution and abundance. :HCV3. Forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems. :HCV4. Forest areas that provide basic services of nature in critical situations (e.g. watershed protection, erosion control). :HCV5. Forest areas fundamental to meeting basic needs of local communities (e.g. subsistence, health). :HCV6. Forest areas critical to local communities’ traditional cultural identity (areas of cultural, ecological, economic or religious significance identified in cooperation with such local communities). The Global Toolkit has not been explicitly endorsed by the FSC but the revised ordering system appears to have gained widespread appeal and there is a recommendation for its use in FSC reports found in a footnote to an FSC reporting standard. The Global Toolkit was intentionally designed for a wide range of users beyond the FSC scheme. Indeed, in December 2005, the popularity of the HCV approach led to the formation of the HCV Resource Network which includes a broad platform of NGOs as well as the World Bank and the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).http://www.hcvnetwork.org High conservation value areas The concept of a High conservation value forest has now been generalized and used by other certification schemes like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the Better Cotton Initiative, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) and Bonsucro, among others. Consumer goods companies (mainly members of the Consumer Goods Forum) have also made independent commitments to protecting High Conservation Values in their supply chains. The analogous six High Conservation Values are: * HCV 1: Concentrations of biological diversity including endemic species, and rare, threatened or endangered species, that are significant at global, regional or national levels. * HCV 2: Intact forest landscapes and large landscape-level ecosystems and ecosystem mosaics that are significant at global, regional or national levels, and that contain viable populations of the great majority of the naturally occurring species in natural patterns of distribution and abundance. * HCV 3: Rare, threatened, or endangered ecosystems, habitats or refugia. * HCV 4: Basic ecosystem services in critical situations, including protection of water catchments and control of erosion of vulnerable soils and slopes. * HCV 5: Sites and resources fundamental for satisfying the basic necessities of local communities or indigenous peoples (for livelihoods, health, nutrition, water, etc...), identified through engagement with these communities or indigenous peoples. * HCV 6: Sites, resources, habitats and landscapes of global or national cultural, archaeological or historical significance, and/or of critical cultural, ecological, economic or religious/sacred importance for the traditional cultures of local communities or indigenous peoples, identified through engagement with these local communities or indigenous peoples.

It is used for hand metalworking. It may be sold in sheets or in narrow rolls, typically 25 or 50 mm wide, often described as \\"emery tape\\". The cloth backing makes emery cloth stronger in tension than sandpaper, but still allows a sheet to be conveniently torn to size. Emery paper, more commonly seen, has a paper backing and is usually a finer grit. Emery was considered a suitable abrasive for fitting work and the final adjustment of steel parts for a perfect fit. It had the advantage that, unlike harder abrasives, it was not considered to embed abrasive traces in the polished components afterwards. Emery was also used for cleaning, as a means of removing rust from polished steel components. Both emery cloth and paper are still sold in hardware and do it yourself stores, but have been largely supplanted by the increased use of machine grinding to precision size, which has minimized or eliminated the need for hand-fitting; the widespread availability of powered hand tools employing sanding and grinding accessories such as flapwheels; and a shift to other forms of abrasive, such as aluminum oxide, aluminium zirconia and silicon carbide.

Life  Solhi al-Wadi was born in Baghdad on 12 February 1934 to an Iraqi father and a Jordanian mother, who moved to live in Damascus, Syria, when he was a child. He went to Victoria College, a British boarding school in Alexandria, Egypt, where he studied violin and composition at the local conservatory. In 1953 he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music in London to pursue higher studies in music. In 1960, after graduating, Solhi al-Wadi returned to Damascus and began work on establishing serious music as part of the fine arts scene in Syria. In 1962 he founded the Arab Institute of Music and was appointed its director. He established relations with several foreign countries, especially the former Soviet Union, to be able to bring qualified teachers in all disciplines and instruments, to teach Syrian youngsters, who were interested in learning music. In 2004 the Arab Institute of Music was renamed the Solhi al-Wadi Institute of Music. In 1990, after years of negotiating with the Syrian Ministry of Culture and other necessary instances, he succeeded in fulfilling his dream of opening The High Institute of Music and Theater, which provides musicians, theater students and dancers in Syria with higher education, without needing to go abroad to study, and he was appointed its dean. He was also appointed professor of theory, history of music and music appreciation in this institute. At the same time, through al- Wadi's efforts, the Damascus Opera House – Dar Al-Assad for Culture & Arts – was opened. He was proud of acquiring a German organ especially built for it. In 1991 another dream of Solhi al-Wadi's came true: the founding of the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra, which gave its first concert under his baton in the same year. Soon invitations started pouring in from all over the world, and over the next few years al-Wadi took the orchestra to perform in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, Germany and the USA. And also al-Wadi himself was invited to conduct orchestras in several countries of the world. In 1995 Solhi al-Wadi conducted the first-ever performance of an opera in Syria, Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, which was performed at the ancient Roman amphitheaters of Bosra and Palmyra for huge crowds of enthusiastic listeners. Solhi al-Wadi's immense overall activity, especially his administrative, teaching and performing duties, allowed him limited time for composing, but he cherished those moments when he could satisfy the great urge he had to express himself. He believed that he should contribute to the world of music by whatever means he was capable of. His works are performed enthusiastically by musicians in Syria and other countries. In addition to that he received throughout his artistic life commissions to compose music for Arabic films, something he accepted and fulfilled with pleasure, but even though incidental music brought him fame all over the Arab world, his compositions for chamber ensembles figure among his finest creative achievements. Solhi al-Wadi died on 30 September 2007 at home in Damascus. He never recovered from a brain hemorrhage which struck him down while conducting the Syrian National Orchestra in a concert on 27 April 2002.  Legacy  He single-handedly supervised the nurturing of a whole generation of talented young musicians. His combined role as an educator, director, conductor, and first-class mass- media communicator did not prevent him from continuously composing original music and re-orchestrating major traditional and folklore music suitable for presentation by a large orchestra or other ensembles.

High school Foley attended Woburn High School in Woburn, Massachusetts. During his sophomore year, Foley batted .400 and pitched a no-hitter for the school's baseball team and was a top basketball guard in the Northeastern Conference. He became the football team's starting quarterback during his junior season. He completed 66 of 96 passes and threw for 10 touchdowns. As a senior, Foley led Woburn's football team to an undefeated season, was named to the Boston Globe All-Scholastic team, and was chosen as a Scholastic Magazine All-Star by the Associated Press. He was also named to the Globe's All-Hoop Second team and as a \\"bench\\" player on the Globe's All-Scholastic baseball team. Boston College Foley was recruited to Boston College by Bob Cousy. He averaged 30 points per game for the Boston College freshman team, but gave the sport up after one season because he believed that he would be better at football and baseball. During the 1964 season, Foley began pressing Larry Marzetti for the starting quarterback job. He replaced Marzetti as starter for the team's October 10 game against Tennessee. Head coach Jim Miller played both Foley and Marzetti against undefeated Villanova. BC won the game 8 to 7 after Foley led a late touchdown drive and ran in a two-point conversion. Foley finished the year completing 72 of 144 passes for 947 yards with four touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also had 56 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. Foley began the 1965 season as BC's starting quarterback, however after throwing three interceptions in a 17-0 loss to Penn State he was benched in favor of junior John Blair. Miller played both Blair and Foley in a 27 to 6 loss to Miami and returned Foley to the starring role the following week for the team's Senior day game against William & Mary. In that game, Foley broke Jack Concannon's record for passing yards and total yards in a game with 300 passing yards and 317 yards of total offense. He finished the season completing 57 of 120 passes for 979 yards with five touchdowns and eight interceptions. He also had 266 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. He finished his BC career with 129 completions in 263 attempts (49.1%), 1916 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. Personal life In 1971, Foley moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where he worked as a regional manager for Confederation Life. He and his wife Sue had four sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, Ed Jr. played offensive line at Bucknell University and has since worked as a college football coach. Their second oldest, Cliff was a starting quarterback at Cherry Hill High School East and played baseball at Villanova. Cliff was succeeded as East's quarterback by his brother Glenn, who led the school to its first championship and followed in his father's footsteps by playing quarterback at Boston College. Their youngest son, Kevin, followed Glenn at East and signed with the Maryland Terrapins after high school. After two seasons backing up Scott Milanovich, he transferred to Boston University in order to receive more playing time. In 1998, Foley donated a kidney to his wife, who had lost both of hers to polycystic kidney disease.

(CCSS or Cass) is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) community-based organization headquartered in Detroit, MI serving Southeastern Michigan, Wayne County, under the direction of a volunteer Board of Directors. Cass Community Social Services has occasionally engaged In acts of political activism, usually In protest of city and state budget cuts. History of Cass Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church In the 1880s the Cass farm, lying between Cass Avenue and Third Avenue and extending northward to the Boulevard, was the very choicest residential section in Detroit, barring the stately homes along Woodward Avenue. A group of Methodists living on the Cass farm, belonging mostly to Central and Simpson Methodist churches, were moved to start a church of their own. On May 1, 1881, David Preston purchased two lots on the corner of Cass and Selden for $7,240, and the Cass Avenue Methodist Episcopal congregation was organized at the Conference of 1883. The church edifice (originally the area now occupied by the offices, kitchen and gym) was erected shortly after the conference. The congregation used the Mason and Rice architectural firm, the same company that designed the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in 1887, the First Presbyterian Church in 1889, Trinity Episcopal Church in 1892 and the Scripps Mansion in 1891. The church sanctuary was added 10 years later in 1891. This time Malcomson and Higghinbotham, an experienced Detroit firm that also designed Central High School - now Wayne State University's Old Main, was the architectural firm. Bishop Newman laid the church cornerstone in September 1891. The cost of the structure was approximately $50,000. In the early years, the Cass membership and constituency were composed almost wholly of well-to-do people. You need only take in the Tiffany windows or the Johnson tracker pipe organ in the sanctuary as evidence of this (the organ is the largest nineteenth century pipe organ in the state of Michigan). Cass boasted many of the city's oldest families and it was one of the most aristocratic churches in Detroit. Moreover, the membership swelled to over 700 members in the first 25 years. During the decade 1918-1929, the church membership shrank from 767 to 275. The growth of the city altered the nature of the Cass farm area and, thus, of the Cass Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church. Most of the members of the church moved from the immediate neighborhood northward to the city's limits and beyond. From a district of choice homes, it became an area with rooming houses and boarding houses with businesses constantly encroaching. The leadership of the church struggled at that time with the option of selling the land and property to build another church closer to where its membership then resided. Under the leadership of Bishop Thomas Nicholson, the congregation decided in 1928 to remain in the area and to intentionally minister to and with the changed constituency. The name was actually changed to Cass Community Methodist Episcopal Church at that time to reflect its new sense of mission. It was in the thirties, during the Great Depression, that the church started its first food lines, offering bread and soup to those who were hungry. Cass depleted its endowment fund to make provisions for the unemployed. Rev. William Perkins organized volunteers to go out into rural areas and bring back truckloads of food for distribution. He also deserves the credit for establishing a wide array of programs for the area youth and seniors. While Perkins was appointed to Cass in the 1940s, the Golden Glove boxing tournaments were held in the gym. At the same time, the church was struggling financially and the physical structure was so bad that in 1941 it was condemned for a short period and the congregation was temporarily re-located to the Jefferson School (now the Edison School at Selden and the Lodge freeway). History of Cass Community Social Services Cass Community Social Services originally began when during the Great Depression when the church opened up a soup kitchen. In the 1950s, Reverend Lewis Redmond expanded the church's social services, creating an evening program, a free bible class (\\"Praise Class\\") and a senior's program (\\"Project Scout\\"). Rev. Lewis Redmond (who pastored Cass from 1953 until 1979) had the vision of reaching out to people with developmental disabilities. He recognized that many individuals were living in groups homes in the area and that they were desperate for life-skills and recreational activities after years of institutionalization. The church began an evening program that met many of their social needs, as well as a Sunday morning Bible study (the \\"Praise Class\\") that addressed some of their spiritual needs. Members of the Praise Class continue to serve as ushers and acolytes for the church today. A second significant program was implemented during the Redmond years: Project Scout, a casework program for homebound seniors. The corridor (the area bounded by freeways and Woodward Avenue) was and continues to be home to a high percentage of senior citizens. Many of the seniors are separated from their families and live in small apartments or single rooms. Their age and economic status leaves them victim to charlatans who charge them excessively for services. Beyond this, they are particularly vulnerable to poor health, bad weather, crime and loneliness. Project Scout helps the elderly to remain independent while providing them with supports and resources. Another senior program begun under Rev. Redmond's leadership was the Senior Center. In fact, his son, Robert Rene Redmond was director of the Senior Center when, on May 6, 1976, he was shot to death by a 17-year-old in an apartment building on Third. The Memorial Room at the church is in Robert's memory, as is the Robert Redmond Park at Selden and Third. Robert was in his early twenties at the time of this death. Significant accomplishments for Redmond beyond the church include leading the campaign to save Burton Elementary School for students from variety of colors, classes, and countries. The elementary school is now widely recognized for its standards and its students. The second feat that we should attribute to Rev. Redmond and the congregation during his pastorate was the establishment of the 4 C's (the Concerned Citizens of the Cass Corridor). This group organized local residents to address issues of housing, education and crime. It was during Rev. Edwin Rowe's tenure (1979–1994) at Cass that the church began addressing the needs of the homeless. The Homeless Drop-In Center and the Interfaith Rotating Shelter were both started in 1988. The Drop-In Center was established as a demonstration project. It was a client-driven program, providing the homeless with a safe place to avoid the elements and to look for jobs, housing, take a shower, do laundry, use the restroom and telephone. It has been important for those in the shelters (because they are not permitted to stay in the shelters during the day) and for those unable to get into shelters. The Interfaith Rotating Shelter was a response to the second group of homeless. The limited number of shelter beds in Detroit were insufficient to handle the growing number of homeless people and, so, 40 some churches were recruited to provide a week's accommodation for up to 80 individuals. In 1988 the group also started a homeless shelter and \\"drop in center\\" for the homeless as well. In 1991 a tent city was created in a nearby vacant lot to oppose the governor's cuts in social services. Rev. Rowe and Cass Church received notoriety throughout Michigan when they protested Governor John Engler's proposed budget reductions for General Assistance. They used the lawn of the Marie, the vacant apartment building next to the church building, to put up a \\"tent city\\". Hundreds or people gathered at the site - homeless, members of the Union for the Homeless, members of Welfare Rights, Cass church members and supporters from the larger denomination and other churches. They kept a vigil, day and night, for a month as a prophetic reminder that the slated cuts would dramatically increase the number of homeless people in the state. Rowe's involvement in the protests was one of the reasons the Detroit News named him a 1991 Michiganian of the Year. Cass' most recent history, under the leadership of Rev. Faith Fowler, has involved several acquisitions of property and program expansion. The Activity Center (3745 Cass) was purchased in 1995 (originally this building was a factory and later, it was a \\"Blood Bank\\"). In June 1996, Cass Community was given the East Side Ministries property (1510 Hurlbut, Detroit 48214), where it has built on the foundations of Richard Kwiatkowski, who spent 26 years ministering to persons with mental illness on Detroit's east side. In 2000, Cass closed on the Scott building (11850 Woodrow Wilson), which houses the agency's administrative offices and several of our programs for homeless people—the Homeless Drop-in Center, a Transitional Housing Program, Safe Haven, the Detroit-Wayne County Rotating Shelter and Detroit's Warming Center for Women and Children, as well as a large commercial kitchen. The social services of Cass started as part of Cass Community United Methodist Church during the Great Depression. In 2002, they became independent when the Scott building opened and a separate nonprofit/Board of Directors was formed. The mission statement directs the activities of the organization: \\"Cass is dedicated to making a profound difference in the diverse populations it serves by providing for basic needs, including affordable housing, promoting self reliance and encouraging community inclusion and improvement.\\" Cass has added health services, Mom's Place I and II, Oasis Detroit, Target Homes, and the Warehouse, since opening Scott. The most recent program expansions have been - opening The Cass House (a residential program for homeless men with HIV/AIDS) and a Factory (doubling the organization's vocational training and employment opportunities while engaging the nonprofit in helping to clean the City and recycling). Cass has 100 employees, utilizes 5,000 volunteers annually and has an operating budget of 6 million dollars. Cass Community became accredited in 1998 and again in 2001, 2004 and 2007 by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (now known simply as CARF). The 2007 accreditation was without a single recommendation (only three percent of the accredited organizations receive this distinction). Funding Cass Community Social Services uses 6 million dollars a year for its programs, of that, 5% comes from the Ford Motor Company, much of the rest comes from donations. On January 20, 2010 USA Today reported on Cass' Green Gym, the nation's first green gym for homeless men, women and children. The gym was constructed through equipment and monetary donations. In May 2017, the organization held a fundraiser called the Cass Community Social Services Tiny Homes Progressive Tour.

Situmorang was born in Harianboho, North Sumatra, and educated in Jakarta. He worked as a journalist and literary critic in Medan, Yogyakarta and Jakarta for a variety of newspapers and periodicals. Sitor was considered by Dutch scholar and critic of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw to be Indonesia's preeminent poet from Angkatan '45 (The Generation of '45) after the decease of Chairil Anwar. \\"His views were deeply influenced by French existentialism of the early fifties, and his poetic forms, as pointed by Subagio, display remarkable similarities with French symbolism (Subagio Sastrowardojo 1976).\\" Despite the European influence he is still deeply rooted in his Batak culture. Early life He was born in 1923 in North Tapanuli, North Sumatra and moved to Jakarta to study at AMS. After graduating from AMS, he went to the US to further study cinematography at the University of California (1956–57). When he grew up, Indonesia was under Dutch rule and a European-style education was provided only for a small minority of the population. Therefore, during high school he studied mostly European literature and Dutch, which he found disturbing and provoked his sense of nationalism. When he was 15, he was inspired to translate \\"Saijah and Adinda\\" (a poem), a part of Max Havelaar by Multatuli, from Dutch to Batak which was his mother tongue even though his Dutch was limited for this kind of literature. This was the starting point of his interest in literature. He began reading more and more Indonesian and western literature, and became inspired to work towards becoming a writer. Career He started his career as a journalist in North Sumatra at Suara Nasional (1945–1946) and Waspada (1947). He was assigned to Yogyakarta (1947–1948) and later worked for Berita Indonesia and Warta Dunia (1957). His first poem \\"Kaliurang\\" was written in 1948 in the style of Pujangga Baru and published at Siasat, ten years after he translated Saijah dan Adinda by Multatuli. In the same year, he wrote a review of Gema Tanah Air, an anthology compiled by H.B. Jassin. During 1950 – 1953, he stayed in Amsterdam and Paris to observe European cultures, funded by a scholarship from a Netherlands foundation. His brief stay in Paris influenced some of his works, such as Pertempuran dan Salju di Paris (1956, collection of short stories) and Paris la Nuit (2002, collection of poems). He published Surat Kertas Hijau (Green Paper Letters) in 1954, a collection of poems, in which he expressed his emotional and intellectual crisis of love and national identity. This publication established him as a prominent and respected poet. Situmorang in the 1990s Since 1950, he was actively involved in cultural polemic, particularly on the shape and direction of Indonesia culture. He was one of African American author Richard Wright's contacts and interlocutors during Wright's trip to Indonesia for the Asian-African Conference in 1955. He became a prominent member of the Institute of National Culture (Lembaga Kebudayaan Nasional /LKN), which was closely tied to Sukarno, the President of Indonesia at the time. In 1967, following the fall of Sukarno in 1965, he was imprisoned and was not released until 1976, without any trial. He was once taught Indonesian at Leiden University, Netherlands during 1982–1990. On 21 December 2014, he died at the age of 91 at his home in Apeldoorn, Netherlands. Selected works He won awards for his works: Pertempuran dan Salju di Paris (Struggle and Snow in Paris), (1956, collection of short stories) from Jakarta Arts Council and Peta Perjalanan (Travel Guide ), (1976, collection of poems) from Badan Musawarat Kebudayaan Nasional Some of his works have been translated to other languages such as : Paris La Nuit (Paris at Night, 2001), a collection of poetry, into French, English and Russian, and Rindu Kelana into English.

Legendary for her salon parties, she enjoyed being the conduit for many unlikely meetings and collaborations. In 1938, when a significant number of European artists were fleeing Europe, she started the Hannah Smith Agency in New York City. The Agency represented a select group of artists and thinkers, embodying Smith’s knack for collecting artists and ideas. Background Born in Philadelphia to an influential Quaker family, Smith’s background was one of high ideals, inquiring intellect and incipient feminism. This led to a rigorous education, on both sides of the Atlantic. Early on, family connections brought her into close contact with influential figures such as critic Bernard Berenson, philosopher Bertrand Russell, and Martha Carey Thomas (a relative whose unhappy love affair was fictionalized by Gertrude Stein in Fernhurst). It also set the tone for Smith’s later life: provoking, reconciling and enjoying a play of contradictory ideas. The 1920s In the 1920s Smith struck out on her own, making a crusading passion her defining characteristic. With connections to Gertrude Stein through Carey Thomas, Smith soon became enamored of the circle of American avant-gardists in Paris at this time. Stein and Alice B. Toklas, while holding Carey Thomas in highest regard, appear to have held reservations about the motives of the younger Smith. When a prized recipe book went missing, suspicion fell on Smith. But Smith’s exuberant immersion in Paris social life and her family fortune made life less uncomfortable for many artists, composers, and intellectuals. Through previous Philadelphia connections to pianist Constantine von Sternberg and the patron Mary Louise Curtis Bok, Smith saw that composer George Antheil was supported to write his most famous work, the “Ballet Mécanique” in 1924. Under the influence of Antheil and Francis Picabia, among others, Smith became passionately interested in the possibilities of electronic and mechanical arts. In 1927 she acquired an early electronic instrument, an etherphone, from Leon (Lev) Theremin. She was also attending various Movement Demonstrations at Gurdjieff’s Paris institute at this time. Experimentation with sound and drama using the prototype aetherphone ended abruptly with a nasty electric shock. After consultations with Gurdjieff and others, she concluded she would return her focus to promoting the works of others. Her peripatetic partner in these activities was an American art student, Alexina “Teeny” Sattler (later Matisse, and later Duchamp). Unfortunately, this exuberant friendship was strained when “Teeny” married Pierre Matisse in 1929, rather against Smith’s advice. Lou Andreas- Salomé was, perhaps more than anyone else, a role model. On a short stay in Paris she introduced Smith to the works of both Freud and Nietzsche. Andreas- Salomé left a number of unsent letters to Freud at Smith’s home. Smith kept them, but never opened them. The 1930s In the early 1930s, Smith attempted a return to the USA, summering in Los Angeles. While Smith enjoyed the brio of new ideas and buzz around Hollywood, she was not ready to leave Paris. The high point of this period was probably the tennis foursome Smith called together, with George Gershwin, Arnold Schoenberg and Groucho Marx. (Marx believing until the last minute that the Schoenberg in question was his uncle, the entertainer Al Schoenberg). Returning to Paris, Smith’s position as a patron saw her play a useful role in the mounting of the Museum of Modern Art's 1936 exhibition, Fantastic, Dada, and Surrealism. The use of the word ”Fantastic” in the show’s title has been attributed to Smith. Smith traveled to New York for the show’s opening. The exhibition’s rapturous reception amongst New York’s literati and the deteriorating political situation in Europe inclined Smith to return to America. She set up house in New York on West 51st Street, where she would live until her death. In the spacious modernist apartment, she was the consummate host of soirées and culinary experiments that are said to have included among many others Max Ernst, Kurt Seligmann, Bob Motherwell, Little Richard, André Breton, Oscar Levant, Nikola Tesla, Dai Vernon, Linus Pauling, Louis Kahn, Maya Deren, John Cage, Joseph Cornell, Kurt Gödel, Nadia Boulanger Dylan Thomas, and Al Schoenberg. In 1938, Smith famously wired Samuel Beckett in Paris while he was recuperating from a severe stabbing by the gangster pimp, Prudent. The telegram read, “STOP”. The Hannah Smith Agency Smith established her agency in New York in 1938. Keenly aware of the difficulties facing European artists arriving in New York, her intention was to make a professional practice of promoting new talents and ideas to a wider public. Taking inspiration from the photographer Dorothy Norman, her intention was that avant-garde ideas would become part of the mainstream and effect social change. In the late 1940s Smith sought to produce “The Witches' Cradle,” a film that Maya Deren and Marcel Duchamp envisaged in his Fourteenth Street studio but never completed, Deren giving up formal art practice upon her initiation into Vodou. Smith supported the groundbreaking fieldwork of Ilona and Peter Opie in the 1950s, researching children’s games, toys and playgrounds. Through a connection with the Opies, at this time the Hannah Smith Agency sought publishing for Mim Hickman's complete and comprehensive archive of songs, dances and scrimshaw from Blackwaterfoot Bay in the Arran Isles. In 1960, the Smith Agency sent 16mm cameras, film stock and editing equipment to the Yuat-Langam people in the Sepik River area of Papua New Guinea, the intention being that the Yuat-Langam people would collectively make movies and the Smith agency would arrange distribution. Later Life. With her health in decline, and with her admiration for John Cage and his work, Smith was an avid supporter of the Mycological Society of America and spent restful times in the forests of upstate New York with Cage and other mushroom-loving friends.

He was a high ranking influential member of the Mexican Mafia before becoming a federal witness in 2003. His life is chronicled in Chris Blatchford's true crime book The Black Hand: The Story of Rene \\"Boxer\\" Enriquez, and his life in the Mexican Mafia. Early years Enriquez grew up in a middle-class home in Cerritos, California but hung out in Artesia, California. He showed early promise in school, but dropped out of Cerritos High School in the 9th grade. His dad made him help out in the family business, but Rene preferred stealing with his friend, Johnny Mancillas. Enriquez channeled his ambitions into the local street gang of Artesia, Artesia 13.NPR.org: Rene Enriquez radio story Young Rene idolized his older brother, Marc, who was in a gang from nearby Artesia. Marc gave him the nickname \\"Boxer\\" and asked him to break into neighbors' homes. At 12, Rene was jumped into Marc's gang. Criminal career In his teens, Enriquez was arrested after committing a string of armed robberies and was sentenced for a long period in prison. In 2015, Enriquez testified that he was dragged into a gang at the age of 12 or 13, when members of a Los Angeles street gang beat him behind a gas station as an initiation. He went to juvenile hall after he and two other partygoers raped an intoxicated woman. At the age of nineteen, Enriquez first encountered the Mexican Mafia, or La eMe. While Enriquez was imprisoned at the Deuel Vocational Institution, he acted as a Hitman for the Mexican Mafia and stabbed a gang member from Los Angeles, who survived the stabbing. Enriquez later stabbed to death a Vagos Motorcycle Club member nicknamed \\"Chainsaw.\\" In 1985, Enriquez became a full-fledged Carnal (Mexican vernacular Spanish for brother) or made guy in the Mexican Mafia. He projected the Mexican Mafia into a status of unprecedented organizational structure with a base army of approximately 60,000 heavily armed gang members who controlled the prison system and a large part of California crime. He stated, \\"I believe I'm a cut above the rest. As a mafioso, you have to be an elitist. You have an elitist, arrogant mentality. That's how you carry yourself in the Mexican mafia. That's how you project yourself.\\" In 1989, Enriquez was released on parole and began exporting street tax from drug dealers and other criminals in a territory which he had been assigned. He committed two murders. He ordered the assassination of Cynthia Gavaldon, an alleged drug dealer whom he believed was holding back street tax from him. He also killed a fellow Carnal, David Gallegos, who had fallen out of favor with the gang by running from a gunfight. Enriquez gave a fatal overdose of heroin to Gallegos and shot him five times in the head to make sure he was dead. His criminal history also includes jailhouse stabbing attacks on other inmates, drug trafficking, extortion, and a sexual assault.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln- rene-enriquez-parole-decision-20150220-story.html\\"Sex Offender Archive Record: Rene Olmos Enriquez\\".

Admission Date: 03/25/1993. Current Location: Ironwood State Prison. Information current as of: 07/22/2018 Since he was a prison gang member, Enriquez was locked in a windowless isolation cell in the Security Housing Unit, or SHU. There inmates spend 23 hours a day alone without seeing the outside world, except during their yard time in which they are transferred to a small cage outside filled with workout equipment. Years later, Enriquez described the SHU:https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94333325 \\"What impacts me immediately as soon as I walk in, is the smell. I just stepped outside from the bus and you smell the pines, the redwoods, the forest ... these earthy, loamy smells. But as soon as you step into the SHU, it hits you like a wave. It's the smell of despair, depression, desperation. This is a place where people come to die.\\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94333325 In the mid-1990s, the Mexican Mafia put out calls to stop drive-by shootings among L.A. Latino gangs. But Enriquez says the aim was not peace.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94333325 \\"Our true motivation for stopping the drive-bys was to infiltrate the street gangs and place representatives in each gang, representatives which then, in turn, tax illicit activities in the areas,\\" he said. Enriquez said the Mexican Mafia wanted to channel the random shootings into a form of violence it could control, for profit.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94333325 \\"And we already had it planned out that California would be carved up ... into slices, with each member receiving an organizational turf,\\" he said.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94333325 Defection from Mexican Mafia In 2003, Enriquez left the Mexican Mafia.http://www.policemag.com/videos/channel/gangs/2009/12/mexican-mafia- prison-debriefing.aspx Since then, he has provided intelligence and other information to help law enforcement, acting as an expert witness in dozens of criminal trials and speaking at a number of conferences and training sessions. In 2014, officials with at least 11 federal and state law enforcement agencies wrote letters to the State Parole Board attesting to his contributions.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rene-enriquez- parole-decision-20150220-story.html According to Enriquez's parole officer, \\"There is a possibility Rene may get out of prison once his work with the feds are done, however there is also possibility that he may not.\\" In February 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown blocked Enriquez's release, citing security reasons. \\"Because he is a high-profile drop out targeted by the Mexican Mafia, Mr. Enriquez's parole poses a serious security risk to him, his family, his parole agents, and the community in which he is placed,\\" Brown wrote. Enriquez told the board that if released, he would enter the Federal Government's Witness Protection Program because he is on the Mexican Mafia's hit list for his cooperation with law enforcement. He would not appear as a registered sex offender because of witness protection, he said, but said that he would be under stringent monitoring by the U.S. Marshals Service.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/california-governor-blocks- parole-for-ex-mexican-mafia-chief/ar-BBhOuRp?ocid=iehp \\"I cannot undo the past.

In April 2019, Enriquez was again denied parole by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Although he again expressed remorse for his criminal past and a desire to change, the family of Cynthia Gavaldon also testified before the parole board, disputing Enriquez's allegations that she was a drug dealer and questioning the sincerity of Enriquez's break with organized crime.

Background  As the First Sino-Japanese War approached its end, the Japanese took steps to ensure that Qing-ruled Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores (Penghu) would be ceded to Japan under the eventual peace treaty. Although hostilities in northern China were halted during the peace negotiations that eventually resulted in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (April 1895), Taiwan and the Pescadores were specifically excluded from the scope of the armistice, allowing the Japanese to mount a military operation against them without imperiling the peace negotiations. The key to the capture of Taiwan was the Pescadores, which lay midway between mainland China and Taiwan. Their occupation by the Japanese would prevent further Chinese reinforcements from being sent across the Taiwan Strait. On 15 March 1895, a Japanese expeditionary force of 5,500 men set sail for the Pescadores Islands. The expeditionary force landed on Pa-chau Island (八罩嶼; modern-day Wangan), to the south of the main Pescadores archipelago, on the morning of 23 March.  Campaign  Although the Pescadores were garrisoned by 15 Chinese regular battalions (5,000 men) and defended by the recently completed Hsi-tai coastal defense battery (built in the late 1880s in response to the capture of Pescadores by the French during the Sino-French War), the Japanese met very little resistance during the landing operation as the defenders were demoralized. It took the Japanese only three days to secure the islands. After a naval bombardment of the Chinese forts, Japanese troops went ashore on Fisher Island (漁翁島; modern-day Siyu) and Penghu Island on 24 March, fought several brief actions with defending Chinese troops, and captured the Hsi-tai battery (known to the Japanese, from the Japanese pronunciation of its Chinese characters, as the Kon-peh-tai fort; likely 拱北砲臺) and Makung. In the next two days they occupied the other main islands of the Pescadores group. The following detailed account of the 1895 Pescadores campaign, drawing on official Japanese sources, was included by James W. Davidson in his book The Island of Formosa, Past and Present, published in 1903. Davidson was a war correspondent with the Japanese army during the invasion of Taiwan, and enjoyed privileged access to senior Japanese officers.  Casualties  Japanese battle casualties were minimal. However, an outbreak of cholera shortly after the capture of the islands claimed the lives of more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers within a few days.

Swaleside forms part of the Sheppey prisons cluster, which also includes HMP Elmley and HMP Standford Hill. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Swaleside opened in 1988 with four residential wings (A-D), each holding 126 prisoners. E wing, a purpose-built drug treatment unit opened in 1998, with a holding capacity of 120 prisoners. In 1999 F wing opened, also designed to hold 120 prisoners. A further two wings were added, G wing in 2009 and H wing in 2010, each with a 179 holding capacity. The prison also has a 25-bed segregation unit and a 17-bed inpatient health care unit. In August 2002, an investigation was launched into a major disturbance at Swaleside Prison. The aggression of an inmate locked in his cell was the catalyst, with some prisoners in the same wing refusing to return to their cells and demanding money and a helicopter. In April 2006, a prison officer from Swaleside was jailed for two years, after he tried to smuggle cannabis into the prison. The officer (who is the son of a prison governor) had been discovered as he reported for his shift during a routine search. Two months later, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons praised Swaleside Prison for its \\"greatly improved living conditions and atmosphere.\\" The report also stated that relations between staff and prisoners were good and security was well-managed. However the prison was told to increase employment places and training programmes for prisoners, as well as improve anti-bullying and race relations strategies. A further inspection report in September 2008, again praised Swaleside for being a safe prison with good staff-prisoner relations. The report also highlighted improvements in the prisons anti-bullying, suicide and self-harm prevention arrangements. However the report again criticised the amount of time prisoners spent in their cells, with a lack of work and training places available at the jail. The report also called for further improvements in race relations at Swaleside. In October 2014, The Prison Officers Association said a major incident had happened at the jail and a prison officer had been stabbed during a riot, Mike Rolfe told the BBC a prison officer had been injured and he said a disturbance began at the jail during the afternoon and was still ongoing. The officer was taken to hospital to treat facial injuries but had since been discharged.https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/04/hmp-swaleside-kent- prison-officer-injured-inmates In March 2015, a prisoner was murdered by two fellow inmates. A Kent Police spokesman said: \\"The Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate has launched a murder investigation after a man was pronounced dead in HMP Swaleside at around 7pm on Wednesday 25 March. Two men, aged 32 and 44, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody.\\" The prison today Horticultural unit at HMP Swaleside Swaleside is a Category B prison for adult males, more than half of them serving life sentences. It is a main centre prison for prisoners in the first stage of a life sentence. The prison has a high minority ethnic population of between 30–40%, and a similar number of foreign national prisoners. Education at the prison is provided by Canterbury College, with courses ranging from basic education to Open University level. Employment activities for inmates include industrial cleaning, engineering, commercially run industries workshops, horticultural and agricultural activities. A high proportion of prisoners surveyed said they had felt unsafe at Swalesdale. Many also said getting alcohol and drugs was easy there.Swaleside prison: Sixty inmates take control of wing and light fires The Independent A 2016 HM Inspectorate of Prisons report stated the prison was dangerous with far too much violence. Mike Rolfe of the Prison Officers Association said: Rolfe added a good relation was needed where prison officers could encourage prisoners to work or study and help prisoners turn their lives round. Rolfe has also described Swaleside as \\"a particularly difficult place to work\\" because of an \\"acute staff shortfall\\" and high levels of violence.Swaleside Prison: Inmates take over part of jail BBC Former Swaleside governor, John Podmore, said prisons were \\"undoubtedly dangerous\\" and added: There was a riot at Swaleside in December 2016 when prisoners took over a wing for a time.Swaleside Prison: Wing reclaimed after inmates take control BBC Reportedly at least nine prisoners from Birmingham Prison were transferred to Swalesdale.

He was also involved in one of the longest bare-knuckle boxing prize fights when he defeated \\"Australian Kelly\\" after a near-three and a half hour bout at Island Pond in 1860.Asbury, Herbert.

London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 102) Biography Dan Kerrigan was one of five siblings born to Irish immigrant parents in New York City's Sixth Ward in 1843. His father, Daniel P. Kerrigan, was a lawyer and his mother \\"a woman of superior education\\". Dan Kerrigan received a public school education and later attended a local Catholic seminary under Rev. Father Halpin. He was a choir boy at St. Patrick's Church and was strongly encouraged to pursue religious training, and for a time considered entering the priesthood, but eventually became dissatisfied and left the school to work for underworld figures Ben Wood and Zachariah Simmons, both controlling the policy racket and illegal gambling in the city.\\"Dan Kerrigan's Death. A Characteristic Sportingman who was Known Throughout the Union\\". _New York Sun, January 27, 1880. Kerrigan quickly rose through the ranks of their organization, becoming a first class bookmaker and accountant, and was given complete control of managing the organization's accounts. He acquired a large personal fortune while employed by Wood and Simmons and began living a lavish lifestyle. Kerrigan started gambling, becoming known as a high roller, and left the service of Wood and Simmons in 1860 to become a professional gambler. A formidable pugilist, he fought \\"Australian Kelly\\" in a $1,000 prize fight that same year. The bout was officially held two miles from the Island Pond Hotel in Island Pond on August 22, 1860. The fight lasted 25 rounds, lasting nearly three and a half hours, and was eventually won by Kerrigan after a foul blow by Kelly.\\"The Prize Ring.; Fight between Dan Kerrigan and Australian Kelly - Kerrigan Victorious\\". New York Times. August 22, 1860. He became deeply involved in illegal gambling, having mixed success with running faro banks throughout the city, and traveled the United States for almost 20 years becoming one of the most widely recognized sportsmen in the country. He was also a regular at nearly every horse race held at Jerome Park, Saratoga and Monmouth Park. Kerrigan developed extensive political connections as a longtime political organizer and \\"fixer\\" for Tammany Hall and was at one time the chairman of the Tammany Hall General Committee. In 1878, Kerrigan opened a saloon in the Twenty-Ninth District known as the Strand. This establishment became very popular in the area however, the following year, he was arrested by Captain Alexander \\"Clubber\\" Williams and charged with keeping a \\"disorderly house\\". His political connections secured his release and, in October 1879, he became one of the owners of the Star and Garter with William C. Rogers. During his four months at the establishment, he loaned $6,000 to those in need. In early-January 1880, Kerrigan contracted a severe cold which quickly turned into pneumonia. Although he was advised to seek medical treatment, Kerrigan ignored this advice and his condition grew more serious. On January 22, he left his home to ride with a friend and returned seriously ill. Two physicians were called, Dr. Loomis and Sass, but were doubtful that he would recover. His three brothers and sister were called, as well as his partner William Rogers, and remained with him until the time of his death four days later. He dictated his last wishes during this time and, although he had not written a will, Kerrigan expressed that he wished his fortune to be divided among his family with Rogers as the executor. He also said he did not wish an elaborate funeral but to be quietly buried next to his parents in Calvary Cemetery. Kerrigan died at the Star and Garter on the evening of January 27, 1880. His funeral was held the following day at the Church of the Holy Innocents.

In the late 1930s he was a member of the Xavier University jazz band in New Orleans. In 1939 Anderson returned to Oklahoma City and joined the Leslie Sheffield band that included Charlie Christian, another Zelia Breaux pupil. In 1940 he went to Kansas City and became trumpeter for the Jay McShann band, which included Charlie Parker on alto saxophone, Ben Webster on tenor saxophone, bassist Gene Ramey, drummer Gus Johnson and blues shouter Walter Brown.[ Scott Yanow at allmusic] Ross Russell described Anderson's style as a trumpeter, during his tenure with McShann, as having \\"smooth tone and legato phrasing\\" influenced by previous work with Charlie Christian, in Oklahoma City. Russell considered Anderson \\"the most advanced musician in the band after [Charlie] Parker,\\" and described him as an innovator: \\"the first to play in the new, linear, semi-legato, light-toned style later made popular by Fats Navarro and Dizzy Gillespie.\\" Later Anderson was co-leader, with Charlie Parker, of a small band that worked for several weeks at Tootie's Mayfair in Kansas City.

Since then, there have been several isolated issues on special topics, sporadically up to mid-2000, edited by others but most with some degree of input from Howe (e.g. three almost completed issues, and using other materials in his files). Reviews, articles and interviews in this \\"high- quality\\" fanzine were authoritative and are cited in serious studies of Doctor Who and some have been republished in books of interviews.See the site http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/earthshock/detail.shtml which quotes the Zerinza review of \\"Earthshock\\". The fanzine was for a decade the journal for the ADWFC (membership and subscription being combined) and it played a key role in creating and expanding Doctor Who fandom in Australia, reaching about 1,000 subscribers by the mid-1980s. It was partly founded to rally fans against the Australian Broadcasting Commission's decision to cease purchasing the Doctor Who series (made in mid-1976), launching a \\"Save Doctor Who Campaign\\" with the first issue, it contained relating news items thereafter. Zerinza, and Howe (as founder and President of the ADWFC), were often credited by fans with the subsequent decision by the ABC to resume and increase screening the series (from 1978). Introduction Zerinza was the first continuous Doctor Who fanzine published in Australia, appearing fairly regularly for 8 years with subsequent issues at irregular intervals. It gained an international readership, and for many years was the only continuous Doctor Who fanzine in the country, other clubs or fans only briefly issuing newsletters or other items. Prior to Zerinza there had only been a few Australian fanzines with occasional Doctor Who material in them, such as two by students at Sydney University: the main one being Jon Noble's South of Harad, East of Rhun (mainly a Tolkien 'zine, hence the name),First published in 1975, S.o.H., E.o.R., issue 2 in Oct. 1975 was given an alternate title Macra, after a Doctor Who alien, and issue 6 in late Feb 1976 was a \\"Special Dalek Issue.\\" and a major analytical article on the series by Terry Dowling, a future Science Fiction and Fantasy author, as a one-off splash in a 1975 issue of Enigma, the fanzine of the Sydney University Science Fiction Association (S.U.S.F.A.).Enigma Vol. 6, No. 1, March 1975, had a Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) cover with aliens, and article \\"Space Opera Plus: The Achievement of Doctor Who\\", pp. 3-11. See Dowling's web page As examples, these were to feed directly into the origins of Zerinza, and their editors encouraged and helped in its gestation. There was no other fanzine dedicated to the series in the country, nor related to a fanclub. Although a few fans did receive the English fanzine of Keith Miller.See \\"Fandom in the Seventies\\" by Stephen James Walker, in his Talkback: Volume Two: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Doctor Who Interview Book: The Seventies, pp. 216-19. Beginnings Around mid-1976, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) had decided to cease purchase of the BBC TV series Doctor Who, a decision which was communicated to the S.U.S.F.A. in reply to its lobbying for extra repeats of the series. The S.U.S.F.A. President Antony Howe immediately launched a campaign to \\"Save Doctor Who\\" in August. This consisted of a demonstration of fans outside the ABC offices in Sydney with the Association's Dalek which had been built for a Dalek race in Melbourne.For photos of this Dalek see the site http://home.netspeed.com.au/reguli/daleksdownunder.htm Howe and Dallas Jones issued press releases, and Howe had posters and leaflets printed about the ABC decision. He also formed contacts with other clubs and individuals in several cities in Australia, as well as the main British fans who had recently formed the Doctor Who Appreciation Society. To keep the campaign to save the show going, Howe also decided to launch a fanzine to report on news and create a basis for a nationwide pressure group. He selected as its name \\"Zerinza\\", a word meaning \\"Good Success\\" according to a purported Dictionary of Dalek words in the 1965 Dalek Annual. The first issue of Zerinza was published by Howe, in September, with the assistance of the S.U.S.F.A. fanzine editor who did the printing at cost which made it all possible. Over three hundred copies were printed and the premier issue contained a report on the demonstration, news about the ABC's scheduling policies for the series, reviews, and plans for the club. Zerinza was launched at a S.U.S.F.A. campus screening of the film \\"Doctor Who and the Daleks\\" on September 21, 1976, hoping to reach as many fans as possible (all who attended being given a copy), and it was also mailed out to scores of potential subscribers with the aid of editors of other fan publications in Sydney (Jon Noble's South of Harad, East of Rhun), and Melbourne (Leigh Edmond's Fanewsletter). The first issue of Zerinza was distributed free, but thereafter by subscription, and with sales through science fiction bookshops, mainly \\"Galaxy\\" in Sydney, and \\"Space Age\\" in Melbourne, but also some others around the country over the years. Subscribers were deemed to be members of the new \\"Australasian Doctor Who Fan Club.\\" After Howe's resignation as President and editor (1984), in the 1990s this club was renamed several times, and is now known as the Doctor Who Club of Australia (or DWCA). Early years The early issues were printed on quarto pages, and were fairly short, the first, being free was just 6 pages, but other single issues ranged from about 12 to 20 pages, and consisted in the main of articles, story outlines, some fan fiction, book reviews, and latterly reviews of the latest season of Doctor Who. Marking a major advance in quality, and the largest early issue, was the double issue, #5/6 (late 1977) with colour cover artwork, and extra pages of text and an interview with actor, Barrie Ingham, who had been in a play in Sydney. Others of the early issues were notable for the fan art of Andrew Szabo who had worked for Hanna Barbera animation studios in Sydney, he did the cover art for many issues, internal illustrations, and his cartoon version of the TV series \\"Pyramids of Mars\\" was spread over two issues, #7, and #12. The first nine issues were printed for Howe by a friend at the University, Van Ikin (now Doctor Van Ikin of the English Department of the University of Western AustraliaStaff page) who printed the S.U.S.F.A.'s journal \\"Enigma\\" on a small offset press which kept the costs to a minimum. The free issue did not net many subscribers, as many seemed wary that it was too short, so it had a slow start, and a six-month gap between issues #2 and #3 due to university commitments in early 1977. Steady appearance from #3 (July 1977), for a year (to #7 in May 1978) helped the subscriber base grow slowly. The decision of the ABC to screen the series as a flagship programme in 1978, should have launched the 'zine to wider readership, but Howe who had left university and was unemployed, had no money to overcome the perilous production situation, and delays this time were made far worse by the old S.U.S.F.A. machine which was increasingly unreliable, hindering any growth. There was a prolonged delay between issue #7 (out in May 1978) and #8/9 (due in June, but delayed until March the following year). The delays greatly annoyed some subscribers and it might all have ended there, but by 1979 Howe was employed and was able to use the many parts that had been printed by Ikin, and could afford to fill the gaps using a commercial printer. He issued the 'zine with a colour cover of Ice Warriors (drawn by Howe) and a huge fold-out Dalek photo poster included by way of apology for the delay. Even with this chequered period of two and a half years, the first \\"Editorial\\" in a 1979 Zerinza stated it now had \\"over 150\\" subscribers.Zerinza #8/9, March 1979, p. 2. It probably also had sales of another 100 or so in shops and at fan events. Fairly respectable in fanzine terms, but not the \\"Good Success\\" claimed by the so-called Dalek word \\"Zerinza.\\" Following the decision of ABC TV to continue such an emphasis on screening the series during 1979, the club's membership increase continued. This was accelerated by Tom Baker's visit to Australia for an ABC TV promotional tour in February 1979. The ABC also began to give out the club's address. All of which was a stimulus to the magazine, apparently doubling sales by the end of the year. The ABC allowed the club a lengthy interview with Baker, which was the centrepiece of a Special Issue (#10/11) devoted to the Fourth Doctor's visit Down Under, with fan reports from around the country, and many photos supplied by ABC publicity, which removed any copyright difficulties. It was largely edited by Howe's mother, Rosemary, and marked the first full switch to commercial printing and double-quarto format with centrefolds of photographs. The completion of Andrew Szabo's Pyramids of Mars comic, Zerinza #12, saw a return to using the old machine as Howe became the S.U.S.F.A.'s printer on Ikin's departure to work inter-state. Howe took over the now repaired machine and used the opportunity to reprint most of the early issues in late 1979 and into 1980, which explains some dating discrepancies as reprints had the correct publication dates, since some original dates had earlier been in error due to hold ups after their date had been printed. For the first club public event, a \\"Party\\" on Nov. 24 1979, Howe had Zerinza #13 commercially printed again to utilise the wider selection of photographs now available through the ABC's Publicity Department. Unemployment, saw the 50 page triple issue #14/15/16 and #17 printed at home by Howe, but the membership of the club was now great enough thereafter for economies of scale to have enabled all issues (from #20 to #35) to be commercially printed. While still used for news and ephemeral notices, the occasional lengthy delays continued. Issue #18/19 (a Jon Pertwee Special Issue) was due in August 1980 but could not be printed in sequence due to delays, so the subscribers were sent #20 instead. Such hiccups had rendered Zerinza far less useful as a vehicle for news than originally planned as gossip or BBC announcements naturally often dated very quickly. This led to a club newsletter (see below). The Pertwee issue was, in the event, never issued by Howe, as it was long delayed; after being abandoned in the later 1980s it finally appeared in the 1990s. More Professional Style The 1980s saw a shift in the fanzine's style away from the more folksy nature of its early fanzine origins adopting a more serious approach. In mid-1980, Howe himself printed issue #14/15/16, billed as a \\"special issue\\", it was a popular novelisation of The Daleks' Master Plan, by his mother, Rosemary (since reprinted several times and sold around the world).See National Library catalogue ; and This story had never been screened in Australia due to censorship problems, and there appeared no likelihood of a book at the time, so it had been worked on for several years as a means to enable Australian fans to enjoy the story they had missed. The club also began to publish a newsletter which took over the news and pen pals sections (see below). In effect, shorn of the ephemeral parts of the contents, and increasingly with professional printing, the fanzine rapidly changed in appearance, there being a big drop in the amount of artwork (Szabo was now rarely a contributor), and an increasingly high quality photographic content, fan fiction was also dropped. A growing range of graduate writers saw the contents became more serious and analytical, such as an article on companions, Regeneration (Tom Baker to Peter Davison), and lengthy season reviews in several issues. These issues often had a home printed \\"Supplement\\" of letters, detailed fan club surveys, or other items (usually 4, sometimes 6 foolscap pages). Becoming almost professional in standards with enhanced print quality, some of the debates in its pages were taken seriously around the fan world, and Zerinza continued appearing moderately regularly for the next few years. By mid-1984 the fanzine circulation reached its high point with a print run of 1,800 (#32), but it was notable for Howe's highly critical comments about Twin Dilemma, the introductory story of the new Doctor, Colin Baker, and Producer John Nathan-Turner, asserting (prophetically) that the BBC would axe the series if this marked the style of the future, and he announced he was to wind up the fanzine in disgust. This roused a storm of protest, as by then hundreds of copies of the fanzine was being sold by fans overseas in the United Kingdom and the United States. Within a year the BBC did indeed \\"postpone\\" the series, a move widely seen as the axe. On the wrappers of \\"Data Extract\\" and in other fan publications, Howe continued to attack the production team for the bad ratings and increased violence, slamming the show as \\"Doctor Whooligan\\".His attack on the producer and the direction of the show as \\"Doctor Whooligan\\" in his review of the 25th Season, which appeared in \\"A Voyage Through 25 Years of Doctor Who,\\" a UK fan published overview of the series, dated December 1988, quoted in the BBC site and Then completing a master's degree, Howe did not have time to publish another issue for two years - an out-sized triple issue (33/34/35) in 1986, the last issue for subscribers. This featured the highest quality printing in the fanzine's history (a removable poster cover of the first Doctor, with 8 page centre spread). The main article by Howe was a detailed examination of William Hartnell as the Doctor, and he argued that his Doctor had been misrepresented as a harsh \\"alien\\" by some fans, and that he had not in fact kidnapped the first companions, Ian and Barbara, but had acted to protect his grandchild Susan. Thereafter Howe ceased to publish it. The fanzine did not totally die off after that, however. The new President of the club, Dallas Jones, published a few issues (see below), completed one issue delayed for ten years, #18/19: a Jon Pertwee Special Issue originally due in 1980. Also, some of the interviews that were done for Zerinza in the 1970s and '80s (of Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, and Terence Dudley), have since been reprinted in the three books of interviews \\"Talkback: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Doctor Who Interview Book,\\" all edited by Stephen James Walker, published over 2005-07 by Telos Publishing Ltd., in England. Those with Manning and Dudley had not been published before. Zerinza also included reprints of interviews that had appeared in other English fan publications such as the Doctor Who Appreciation Society journal Tardis, all used with permission. Zerinza was lodged with copyright libraries National Library of Australia, and the State Library of New South Wales and Fisher Library of Sydney University, and in 1977 Zerinza was granted the International Serial Number by the National Library. These libraries should have a complete run of issues at least to number 35 as they were regularly sent issues, but some issues had gone missing from the NSW State Library by the 1990s. Spin-Offs There were at least two one-off Zerinza newsletters, but these were just occasional, either listed using the fanzine numbering (e.g. Zerinza #13 A, mailed out to advise fans of a visit of the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker, in early 1979), or as separate sheets, variously named. With the \\"Dalek Masterplan\\" issue of Zerinza in mid-1980 was another such single sheet newsletter. A few months later, a regular writer for Zerinza, Dallas Jones, suggested he publish a six-weekly newsletter to fill the void left by the irregular schedules of Zerinza which had lengthy gaps between some issues and was again facing a new production hold-up. The regular club newsletter first appeared in November 1980, being printed by Howe on the S.U.S.F.A. printing machine for the next few years. It was later renamed \\"Data Extract\\" and continues to appear regularly, recently reaching its 200th issue.See memorial pieces in \\"Data Extract\\" number 80, \\"Tenth Anniversary\\" special, Tony Howe, \\"The Origins of Data Extract,\\" and Dallas Jones \\"From the Madhouse\\", both p. 7, and Tony Cooke, \\"DATA EXTRACT: A Review,\\" the special also has reproductions of the first page of issue one (on p. 5), and parts of other issues; and see \\"Data Extract\\" 100, May 1993 for further memories. National Library catalogue details For several years there were also \\"Doctor Who Calendars\\", the first printed by Howe. Later ones were professionally printed and Howe researched and added comprehensive lists of key Doctor Who related dates for each month. Later Special Issues Much unpublished material still existed in Howe's files, and in 1990 when going overseas he gave a pile of articles and half completed issues to Dallas Jones, the then President of the Australian Doctor Who Club. He completed one, the vastly delayed issue (due in 1980) #18/19: a Jon Pertwee Special Issue; and changing the format to A3 instead of the traditional quarto, Jones published two subsequent special issues of Zerinza, one was a novelisation of Power of the Daleks, the other a novelisation of Pirate Planet ; a few years later another three issues of Zerinza were edited and published by Damian Shanahan, one on censorship of the programme in Australia; another was a review issue of the Colin Baker era; and finally a \\"City of Death\\" novelisation; Shanahan also redesigned and reissued the \\"Dalek Masterplan\\" issue. In 2006 Howe started to set up a website for Zerinza, but work and other commitments prevented his getting far with this.

It was commissioned to honor anatomist and surgeon David Hayes Agnew, on his retirement from teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. Background The Gross Clinic (1875). Comparing The Agnew Clinic with Eakins's earlier darker treatment of the same subject illustrates the evolving understanding of surgical hygiene during the intervening 14 years. The Agnew Clinic depicts Dr. Agnew performing a partial mastectomy in a medical amphitheater. He stands in the left foreground, holding a scalpel. Also present are Dr. J. William White, applying a bandage to the patient; Dr. Joseph Leidy (nephew of paleontologist Joseph Leidy), taking the patient's pulse; and Dr. Ellwood R. Kirby, administering anesthetic. In the background, the operating room nurse, Mary Clymer, and University of Pennsylvania medical school students observe. Eakins placed himself in the painting – he is the rightmost of the pair behind the nurse – although the actual painting of him is attributed to his wife, Susan Macdowell Eakins. The painting, also, records the significant transition, in just 14 years, from the earlier status quo – the participants' black frock coats represented in The Gross Clinic (1875) – to the \\"white coats\\" of 1889.Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress\\", Fashion Theory, (2015), pp.1–23. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 The painting is Eakins's largest work.Stefan C. Schatzki. \\"The Agnew Clinic.\\" The American Journal of Roentgenology. Volume 160, Issue 5, 1993. It was commissioned for $750 (equivalent to $ today) in 1889 by three undergraduate classes at the University of Pennsylvania, to honor Dr. Agnew on the occasion of his retirement. The painting was completed quickly, in three months, rather than the year that Eakins took for The Gross Clinic. Eakins carved a Latin inscription into the painting's frame. Translated, it says: \\"D. Hayes Agnew M.D. Most experienced surgeon, clearest writer and teacher, most venerated and beloved man.\\"Kirkpatrick, 396.Agnew Clinic with frame from Flickr. Style The work is a prime example of Eakins's scientific realism. The rendering is almost photographically precise – so much so that art historians have been able to identify everyone depicted in the painting, with the exception of the patient.Medical Class of 1889 and Thomas Eakins' painting of \\"The Agnew Clinic\\". University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center. It largely repeats the subject of Eakins's earlier The Gross Clinic (1875), seen at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The painting echoes the subject and treatment of Rembrandt's famous Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) (in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands), and other earlier depictions of public surgery such as the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica (1543), the Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, and the fourth scene in William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751).  Mary V. Clymer  Students of the medical class of 1889 who commissioned The Agnew Clinic are portrayed as the audience for the surgery—as historian Amanda Mahoney points out, all individuals depicted in the work can be identified by name, except for the patient—and this audience of male medical students creates a composition that highlights power dynamics between the masculine and the feminine in the academic medical hierarchy. Central to the medical care of the patient yet separate in her femininity stands the woman in white—the nurse, Mary Clymer, who serves as the surgeon Agnew's \\"structural counterpart\\" in the composition of the painting, the only other figure on the same level as the surgeon. Credited by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) as the first trained operating room nurse in Philadelphia, Mary V. Clymer was born in Mercer County, New Jersey, in 1861 to a prominent Civil War veteran. At the age of 28, Clymer enrolled in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Training School for Nurses. Graduating in 1889 at the top of her class, Clymer was among the first graduates of HUP's nurse training school, which was established in 1886. Clymer was the recipient of the Nightingale Award for her exceptional patient care and scholarship. Fittingly, Clymer missed her graduation ceremony from the Training School because she was providing emergency care to victims of the 1889 Williamsport flood Some art historians read Clymer's presence in the painting as sympathetic to the female patient: Clymer looks down at the objectified female figure and feels connection with another body separate from the male-dominated hospital hierarchy. Others argue that Clymer's presence challenges this dynamic: Clymer's presence demonstrates the increasing technical advancements within nursing and medicine, her placement in the scene is a nod to the contributions to sanitation and organization that nurses brought to the operating room. Clymer may not look down at the female figure in sympathy but with the cool attention of a trained operating room nurse, one who closely monitors her patient's status and anticipates the needs of the surgical team. Founded in 1878 and opened in 1886, the HUP Training School for Nursing engaged nursing students in rigorous hands-on and lecture-based learning. During the first month of nursing training, \\"probationers\\" began their nursing education providing dietary and cleaning services at the hospital. As they progressed through their nursing education, trainee nurses learned nursing skills on the floor of the hospital and participated in lectures given by physicians at the university hospital. At HUP, Clymer received training through clinical experience providing patient care and lectures presented by the hospital's physicians.  The Clymer Diaries  During her training between 1887 and 1889, Mary Clymer kept diaries that included clinical and lecture notes that have been preserved through the Barbara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing archives. Clymer's diaries reveal daily nursing tasks, practical knowledge learned, and the occasional student's gripe—\\"Learned nothing new, and everything seemed to go wrong. M.V.C.\\" Clymer's notes reveal Eakins’ artistic license in the depiction of the mastectomy in The Agnew Clinic—Clymer wrote that, when preparing a patient for operation, one must cover the healthy breast and reveal the affected breast; this is confirmed in Agnew's own writings. Eakins’ choice to leave the patient nude may have been for shock value, to clarify the nature of the depicted procedure, or to simply fulfill the artist's desire to portray a nude female figure. Not only do the diaries of Mary V. Clymer reveal information regarding operating room etiquette that has been used to help understand The Agnew Clinic, they also detail common practices and materia medica of 19th century medicine employed at HUP during her time there. These medicines and practices include but are not limited to: * General Medicine Beef tea  Cod liver oil  Cold baths for fever  Esmarch bandage  Turpentine as a hemostatic, in the treatment of burns, to relieve shortness of breath and in a poultice for swollen bowels.  Lead acetate, Laudanum, Monsell's solution, and aromatic sulphuric acid as hemostatics.  Milk products: Peptonized milk, Hot milk, Skim milk, and Buttermilk \\"only if fresh.\\"  Opium suppositories  Soda water to assist in digestion  Stimulating enema made with turpentine and yolk of egg Quinine noted to cause rash, blindness or deafness in some patients * Care of the Skin  Casting soap aka glycerin soap used to wash skin and carbonate of sodium and borax to clean skin when rubbing is contraindicated.  Bran or gelatin powder to protect the skin  Oxide of zinc for burns, scalds, and blisters  Zinc powder applied to patients back  Camphorated oil to prevent bedsores and Croton oil rubbed into the skin is noted as being \\"stimulating.\\"  Permanganate of potash for burns  Wound dressing made with \\"lead water and laudanum\\" for dressing of knee amputation * Disinfectants  \\"Alcohol, Borax, Salt, Lime (Chloride, Carbolic acid & Corrosive Stimulate are both).\\"  Bichloride of Mercury which \\"will produce irritation\\" and Iodoform which \\"smells badly & is not as active as the others but when wet is very good.\\"  Carbolic acid as a disinfectant useful only \\"when it comes in contact with what you want to destroy.\\"  Chloride of lime as the \\"best disinfectant.\\"  Prussic acid \\"the most violent poison\\" and Creosote * Respiratory Support  Steam inhalation via atomizer or direct inhalation of steaming water for respiratory support  To alleviate a cough: Flax seed and Irish moss with lemon juice for taste, hot water steam inhalation, Turlington's balsam, Gum Arabic water, Mustard plasteis applied to the chest  For shortness of breath: Hot brandy or ammonia and hot water; Hoffman's anodyne for adults not children; Turpentine, hortshorn or chloroform liniment * Obstetrics and Gynecology  Ipecac for hysteria  Grease newborn baby with cosmoline or sweet oil  Burnt or baked cotton kept in a tin box and \\"once dipped in bichlor\\" before use as disposable absorbent fiber to clean skin of blood during labor/delivery and postpartum * \\"A few [tablets from druggists] we ought always have\\":  1/4 gr. Morphia  1/100 of Atropia  1/8 of pilocarpine Ergotine  1% Nitroglycerine  Controversy  The Agnew Clinic is one of Eakins's most hotly debated works.Kirkpatrick, 390. His decision to portray a partially nude woman observed by a roomful of men (even though they were doctors, and in an undeniably medical setting) was controversial. It was rejected for exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1891, and at New York's Society of American Artists in 1892. Its exhibition at Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition was criticized. Related works Eakins made preparatory sketches for The Agnew Clinic – a drawing of Dr. David Hayes Agnew, an oil study of Agnew, and a compositional sketch for the entire work. Individual studies of all 33 figures were probably made, but none are known to survive.

One of three children (an older brother Charlie, and younger a Sister Cristina), he is first generation Italian-American, as his father (Carmine Giuseppe DeGuglielmo / legally changed his name to Charles Joseph DeGuglielmo) emigrated to the US in 1954 with his family as a teenager, from a village outside of Avellino, Italy. His mother (June Dorothy Galassi) was born in Boston, and of Italian and French Canadian heritage. Playing career DeGuglielmo played both offensive and defensive tackle at Lexington High School (Massachusetts) under legendary Massachusetts high school football coach, Bill Tighe. During that time, Lexington High School won two Middlesex League Championships and played for the Division I Super Bowl title against nationally ranked Brockton High School (MA). Moving on to play collegiately at Boston University, he red-shirted his first year (1986) at BU. Despite being a non-scholarship \\"walk-on,\\" he ultimately became a four-year letterman at Boston University from 1987 to 1990. DeGuglielmo trained under world-renowned strength and conditioning guru, Mike Boyle, who was at the time the Terriers' head strength and conditioning coach. Playing for three different head coaches in five years, and three different offensive line coaches in his first three seasons, he persevered and was voted captain of the 1990 Terriers. The second of his head coaches was Chris Palmer, future head coach of the Cleveland Browns. Palmer and DeGuglielmo would reunite in 2007 at the NY Giants. His final offensive line coach was Tony Sparano, who went on to become the head football coach of the Miami Dolphins. Sparano would later hire Deguglielmo as his offensive line coach in Miami. Playing both guard and center, DeGuglielmo was a first-team All-New England selection as well as a two-time Academic All- Yankee Conference selection. Coaching career = NFL coaching = DeGuglielmo left UCF within a month, joining the New York Giants staff under head coach Tom Coughlin whom he had served as a graduate assistant at Boston College 13 years earlier. In his tenure, the Giants made the playoffs four consecutive years, won Super Bowl XLII, and set a franchise record for rushing yards (2,518) and yards per carry (5.0) in 2008. Afterwards, he held the same job for the Miami Dolphins; in 2011 the Dolphins rushed for 1,987 yards in what was also Reggie Bush's first 1,000-yard season. DeGuglielmo was named the New York Jets' offensive line coach on January 24, 2012. He was fired on February 5, 2013, and spent the 2013 football season as a football analyst for Clear Channel Radio's Sports Talk First Edition, on 560 AM WVOC in Columbia, SC. On January 22, 2014, the New England Patriots announced they had hired DeGuglielmo as the new offensive line coach to replace Dante Scarnecchia, who retired after 30 years with the team; DeGuglielmo had a preliminary agreement to serve as offensive line coach at University of Maryland six days prior to the Patriots' announcement. DeGuglilemo won a second Super Bowl ring in the Patriots' Super Bowl XLIX win over the Seattle Seahawks. The offensive line fared worse in 2015, and was ravaged with injuries, including a season-ending injury to left tackle Nate Solder. He was fired by the Patriots on January 25, 2016, one day after the Patriots' offensive line \\"collapse[d]\\" in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos. On July 29, 2019, just four days into training camp, the Miami Dolphins dismissed offensive line coach Pat Flaherty and named DeGuglielmo to the position. DeGuglielmo had previously been hired as a team analyst.

The company was founded by Donald Pippin, whose musical career has spanned over six decades. Born in Zebulon, North Carolina and educated at Harvard University, Pippin began his career as an accompanist at George Balanchine's School of American Ballet in New York City.Donald Pippin, As the Lights Go Up: Tales From OperaDonald Pippin, A Pocketful of Wry, Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley oral history collection (1998) In 1952, Pippin moved to San Francisco, and has been an integral part of that city's artistic life since then. Audiences have followed him from his start at the hungry i and Opus One in North Beach, through nearly two decades of presenting a weekly chamber music series (1960-1978) at the Old Spaghetti Factory, to his present-day fame as the creator of one of San Francisco's most popular operatic institutions. Pippin's first translation came in 1968, in the course of preparing Mozart's one-act opera Bastien und Bastienne for performance as part of his chamber music series. The opera, and his singing translation of it, were immediate successes with San Francisco audiences. From that point on, Pippin has dedicated himself to the task of producing literate English versions of both well-loved classics and lesser- known gems of operatic literature. His repertoire has grown to include over 70 translations, many of which have been used by the Washington Opera at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the San Francisco Opera Center, the San Diego Opera, the Juilliard School of Music, and the Aspen Music Festival, among many others. In 2005, Dianna Shuster, formerly of American Musical Theater of San Jose, joined Pocket Opera as the Executive Director. Nicolas Aliaga Garcia joined the company as Production Manager in 2009.

Schindler had earlier translated Looking Backward into German (1890). His sequel was printed by the Arena Publishing Company, a prominent radical house of the 1890s; Schindler and publisher B. O. Flower served together on the board of directors of the American Psychical Society. Flower was responsible for one curious aspect of the book's first edition: he believed that the black-on-white contrast of standard printing caused eyestrain, and decided that the pages of Young West would have colored margins, in blue, green, and yellow.Mann, p. 471. Schindler's sequel follows upon the plot of Bellamy's original: protagonist Julian West marries heroine Edith Lette, and they soon have a son. Yet West senior dies only two years after his awakening in the year 2000; \\"Schindler's fictional response was in many ways more sophisticated than the responses of most twentieth-century critics who ignore or downplay West's anguish at the conclusion of Looking Backward.\\"Kenneth M. Roemer, Utopian Audiences: How Readers Locate Nowhere, Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 2003; p. 33. Schindler's book follows the development of the son, \\"young West,\\" from early youth to eventual triumph, when, after a rigorous campaign, he wins election to the presidency of the United States. Schindler's book diverges from Bellamy's original, in that where Bellamy placed strong emphasis on religion, Schindler's attitude is agnostic. (Schindler had already moved away from traditional Judaism; after a brief flirtation with spiritualism around 1892, he became a firm skeptic.)Mann, pp. 472-3. Bellamy thought that socialism would arise first in America, while Schindler expected Europe to be first; he foresaw the weakening of European nationalism and wholesale intermarriage among Europeans.Mann, p. 474. Schindler's book helps to illustrate the wide reach of the utopian literature of its era. While many books in the genre were authored by White Anglo-Saxon Protestant males, other works were created by Jewish, Irish (Ignatius Donnelly's Caesar's Column and The Golden Bottle), and African-American (Sutton E.

He is considered a leading figure during the revitalization period of Armenian culture. Biography Paghtasar Dpir was born in Istanbul in 1683 to parents who had recently migrated from Cesarea. He was educated in local schools and continued his studies with Bishop Astvadzatur Jughayetsi, Legate of the Armenian Catholicos of Etchmiadzin. In 1741, Paghtasar Dpir is appointed headmaster of the secular school of the Armenian Patriarchate in Kumkapu. Many of his students become leading personalities, such as Simeon Yerevantsi, Catholicos of Etchmiadzin, and the poet Petros Ghapantsi. Linguistic contributions Paghtasar Dpir occupies an important position among cultural figures of the late Middle Ages, who believed that classical Armenian (գրաբար) must be revitalized and applied as a literary language. They wanted to tie the new literature with the old through the active application of classical Armenian, aspiring to tap into the rich cultural heritage of the Middle Ages. They try to make classical Armenian more accessible to the masses through their work without submitting to the vernacular (աշխարհաբար). In his vernacular writings, Paghtasar Dpir uses the dialect of Istanbul, which, like other Armenian dialects of the time, often loaned words from foreign and specially from the Turkish language. Lyric poetry Paghtasar Dpir has made an appreciable contribution to the development of modern Armenian poetry. The themes and temperament of his works is, in general, traditional, yet he frequently infuses ideas of freedom and liberalism. He writes not only about love, as troubadours of his time, but also about social, religious and moral issues. The refinement of his language does not constrain his expressions, but allows him to be honest and passionate. Researchers of Paghtasar Dpir’s works point to the uniqueness of the poem entitled “To Mamona” compared to songs written during that period. Here Paghtasar Dpir exposes the demon’s destructive influence of wealth and greed on man. He writes about Mamona from a popular moralistic point of view to repudiate its influence. Another of Paghtasar Dpir’s famous songs is “Ee Nenjmanet Arkayakan Zartir” (From Your Royal Slumber Awaken, 1707), in which he infuses musical themes from modern troubadour and ancient liturgical music. Although it appears to be a love song, it could also be interpreted allegorically as a call to the Armenian nation to awaken from its stupor and to resist foreign rule. Paghtasar Dpir’s musical creativity is clearly influenced by traditional troubadour, religious, as well as contemporary eastern and minstrel music. For his secular and especially for his love songs, he benefits extensively from Armenian national traditional and eastern melodies. Among his most valuable and important contributions to Armenian lyrical heritage is a series called “Taghikner Siro Yev Karotanats” (Little Songs of Love and Yearning).Azg His songbook entitled “Tagharan Pokrik Paghtasar Dpri” (Little Songbook of Paghtasar Dpir, 1723) was reprinted seven times with additions and revisions. Paghtasar Dpir has also written Turkish language poems using Armenian letters. Educational work Paghtasar Dpir has an imposing educational and historical output. In 1741 he is appointed head of the secular school of the Armenian Patriarchate in Kumkapu by Patriarch Hagop Nalian. The school is known to have blossomed during his tenure. For many years, Paghtasar Dpir serves as an educator of Armenian language, grammar, music and other topics. Between 1736 and 1760 he compiles and publishes a series of textbooks for the instruction of classical and vernacular Armenian language, which remain in use for nearly a century. Paghtasar Dpir’s most important educational works are “Parzabanutiun Kerakanutian Karcharot Yev Diurimats” (A Simplified Grammar, Concise and Easy to Understand, 1736) in two volumes, a grammar of classical Armenian written in that language; “Girk Kerakanutian” (A Grammar Book, 1760), a grammar of classical Armenian written in vernacular Armenian; “Hamarot Meknabanutiun Tramabanutian (Concise Commentary On Logic, 1822); Zhamanakagrutiun (Chronology, 1951); and Hamarotutiun Patmutian Movses Khorenatsvo (Summary of Movses Khorenatsi’s History, not published). Contributions to printing In the eighteenth century, printing in Istanbul plays an appreciable role in spreading Armenian culture. In the years spanning from 1720 to 1760, Paghtasar Dpir contributes to literary and printing activities. He assembles a series of scientific, comparative armenological works and prepares editorials for historical, philosophical and theological books. He works with publishers such as Astvadzatur Dpir and his successors. Many Armenian classical historical literary works are published under his supervision, many of them for the first time. Among those are Zenob Glak’s “Girk Patmutian Yergrin Tarono” (History Book of the World of Taron, 1719) and “Girk Vor Kochi Harants Vark” (Book That is Called the Life or our Fathers, 1720), Arakel Siunetsou’s “Adamagirk” (The Book of Adam,1721), Simeon Jughayetsi’s “Girk Deramabanutian” (Book of logic, 1728), Grigor Narekatsi’s “Matian Voghbergutian” (Book of Sorrow, 1726), Grigor Tatevatsi’s “Girk Hartsmants” (Book of Questions, 1729) and Davit Anhaght’s “Girk Sahmanats” (Book of Definitions, 1731).

Its common names also include narrowhead garter snake and narrowhead watersnake. Geographic range It is found in Arizona and New Mexico, and in the Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua and Durango. Habitat and behavior It is found near river banks or streams. It is one of the most aquatic of all garter snakes. Description The snake is blue-grey to olive- grey, or greenish to brown, and it has brown, orange, or black spots on the back. The total length of adults is (about 81–112 cm). It has eight or 9 upper labial scaless, one of which enters the eye, two or three preocular scales, two to four postoculars, and one anterior temporal scale. The keeled dorsal scales are arranged in 21 rows at midbody. Ventrals number 152–177; the anal plate is entire; the subcaudals number 65–87, and are divided.Smith, Hobart M., and Edmund D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. .(Thamnophis, p. 144; Thamnophis rufipunctatus, pp. 152-153.) Diet These snakes are piscivorous, meaning they primarily eat fish. Their diet includes dace, chubs, and both native and introduced trout. They might occasionally prey on salamanders. Threatened species The snake has declined in parts of its range, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified it as of \\"Least concern\\" because of its wide range, presumably large population, and because the rate of decline is not high. However, its status in Mexico is poorly known; were it in a decline there, it might qualify for a category of higher risk. The decline is attributed to introduced species (bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus, fishes, crayfish), habitat loss and alteration, and sometimes, needless killing and excessive collecting. Subspecies Sometimes three subspecies are recognized, including the nominate subspecies: * T. r. nigronuchalis Thompson, 1957 * T. r. rufipunctatus (Cope, 1875) * T. r. unilabialis W.

However, T. r. nigronuchalis is now commonly held as a full species, i.e., Thamnophis nigronuchalis, whereas the status of T. r. unilabialis is more ambiguous; most recent molecular evidence suggests it is a full species as well (Thamnophis unilabialis).

In 1877, the racist Workingman's Party was formed in California, led by Denis Kearney; by 1879 it was powerful enough to help re-write the state constitution of California, inserting provisions intended to curb the powers of capital and to abolish Chinese contract labor. In 1878, the Greenback Party, under the influence of leaders of organized labor, changed its name to the Greenback Labor Party, and continued to operate in some states, electing a congressman as late as 1886; but by 1888 had dissipated. In 1886, a United Labor Party was organized in Chicago under the leadership of that city's Central Labor Union; It drew over 20,000 votes for its county ticket in the fall of 1886, and in the following spring elections garnered 28,000 votes for its candidate for Mayor; but by 1888 it had merged with the Democratic Party in that city.\\"Party Lines in the West; Decrease of Republican Votes in Wisconsin.

The movement was strongly supported by the local socialists, and obtained considerable results in the city of Milwaukee, electing two members of the State Assembly (including Michael P. Walsh, their president) and a member of Congress, Henry Smith. In other states there were groupings known variously as United Labor Party, Union Labor Party, Industrial Labor Party, Labor Reform Party, or simply Labor Party.Hillquit, Morris.

Activity These parties were made up in varying proportions of members of the American Federation of Labor and Knights of Labor, radical socialists, Greenbackers, and even anarchists, and challenged the Republicans and Democrats) primarily in local elections and state elections, but not at the presidential level. The most important of these local races of that period may have been that in New York City in 1886, when the United Labor Party of that city nominated Henry George for mayor of New York, and cast for him 68,000 votes. The Single Taxers and socialists united in this vote, the Socialists supporting the George candidacy as a popular movement against corporate capitalism. But by 1887 the United Labor Party of New York State nominated Henry George for Secretary of State, repudiating socialism. Socialist Labor members, combining with other radical labor organizations, formed a Progressive Labor Party, nominating John Swinton to run against Henry George. The Progressive Labor party vote of about 5000 was virtually confined to New York City. In 1888 two \\"labor parties\\" appeared in the field of presidential politics, namely: (1) the Union Labor Party, which was formed by a coalition of the Greenback Labor Party, largely rural in its constituency, with the urban trade union movement, which had been demanding labor and industrial reforms: it nominated Alson Streeter for president; and (2) the United Labor Party, a much smaller party, which under leadership of a Father Edward McGlynn, of New York, demanded the recognition single tax and the sharing of the rent of land. These parties both disappeared after the campaign of 1888. Legacy For varying reasons, none of these organizations maintained their existence as separate parties. The constituents and activists became involved either in one of the major parties (as in the Chicago example) or in such movements as the Populists (which in urban areas drew heavily on former Labor Party advocates), or the Socialist Party of America, and their various splinter groups. There is no direct continuity between any of these organizations and the Union Labor Party of early 20th- century San Francisco, California; nor with the Duluth, Minnesota Union Labor Party which elected William Leighton Carss to Congress and various candidates to city offices in that region in the early 20th century, before merging into the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.Hudelson, Richard & Ross, Carl.

The western- central part of Honduras was inhabited by the Lenca while other indigenous peoples settled in the northeast and coastal regions. These peoples had their conflicts but maintained commercial relationships with each other and with other populations as distant as Panama and Mexico.\\"Background note: Honduras\\" U.S. Department of State (December 2008). Accessed January 20, 2009 . On July 30, 1502, Christopher Columbus first saw Honduran soil and claimed the territory in the name of his sovereigns, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. He named the area \\"Honduras\\" (meaning \\"depths\\") for the deep water off the coast. In 1523 the first expeditionary forces arrived under the command of Gil Gonzales de Avila, who hoped to rule the new territory. In 1524, Cristobal de Olid arrived with the same intent on behalf of Hernán Cortés. Olid founded the colony Triunfo de la Cruz and tried to establish his own independent government. When Cortes learned of this, he sent a new expedition, headed by Francisco de las Casas. Olid managed to capture his rivals, but was betrayed by his men and assassinated. Cortes himself then traveled to Honduras and established his government in the city of Trujillo before returning to Mexico in 1526. Honduras formed part of the colonial era Captaincy General of Guatemala. The cities of Comayagua and Tegucigalpa developed as early mining centers. By October 1537, the Lenca leader Lempira had unified more than two hundred indigenous groups to resist penetration by the Spanish conquerors. After a long battle, Governor Montejo gained control of the Valley of Comayagua, established the city of Comayagua in another location, and defeated the indigenous forces in Tenampua, Guaxeregui, and Ojuera. Honduras gained independence from Spain in 1821. The country was briefly annexed to the First Mexican Empire. In 1823, Honduras joined the newly formed United Provinces of Central America federation, which collapsed in 1838. Pre-Columbian era =Mayan civilization= Ruins of the Maya city of thumb Pre-Columbian Honduras was populated by a complex mixture of indigenous peoples representing a wide variety of cultural backgrounds and linguistic groups—the most advanced and notable of which were related to the Maya of the Yucatán and Guatemala. Maya civilization had reached western Honduras in the 5th century A.D., probably spreading from lowland Mayan centers in Guatemala's Petén region. The Maya spread rapidly through the Río Motagua Valley, centering their control on the major ceremonial center of Copán, near the present-day town of Santa Rosa de Copán. For three and a half centuries, the Maya developed the city, making it one of the principal centers of their culture. At one point, Copán was probably the leading center for both astronomical studies—in which the Maya were quite advanced—and art. One of the longest Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions ever discovered was found at Copán. The Maya also established extensive trade networks spanning as far as central Mexico.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The Mayan heritage\\"). Then, at the height of the Maya civilization, Copán was apparently abandoned. The last hieroglyph date in Copán is 800 A.D. Much of the population evidently remained in the area after that, but the educated class—the priests and rulers who built the temples, inscribed the glyphs, and developed the astronomy and mathematics—suddenly vanished. Copán fell into ruin, and the descendants of the Maya who remained had no memory of the meanings of the inscriptions or of the reasons for the sudden fall. =Other indigenous groups= Following the period of Maya dominance, the area that would eventually comprise Honduras was occupied by a multiplicity of indigenous peoples. Indigenous groups related to the Toltec of central Mexico migrated from the northwest into parts of what became western and southern Honduras. Most notable were the Toltec-speaking Chorotega, who established themselves near the present-day city of Choluteca. Later enclaves of Nahua-speaking peoples, such as the Pipil, whose language was related to that of the Aztec, established themselves at various locations from the Caribbean coast to the Golfo de Fonseca on the Pacific coast.Haggerty & Millet (\\"Other indigenous groups\\"). While groups related to indigenous peoples of Mexico moved into western and southern Honduras, other peoples with languages related to those of the Chibcha of Colombia were establishing themselves in areas that became northeastern Honduras. Most prominent among these were the Ulva and Paya speakers. Along the Caribbean coast, a variety of groups settled. Most important were the Sumu, who were also located in Nicaragua, and the Jicaque, whose language family has been a source of debate among scholars. Finally, in parts of what is now west-central Honduras were the Lenca, who also were believed to have migrated north from Colombia but whose language shows little relation to any other indigenous group. Although divided into numerous distinct and frequently hostile groups, the indigenous inhabitants of preconquest Honduras (before the early 16th century) carried on considerable trade with other parts of their immediate region as well as with areas as far away as Panama and Mexico. Although it appears that no major cities were in existence at the time of the conquest, the total population was nevertheless fairly high. Estimates range up to 2 million, although the actual figure was probably nearer to 500,000. Spanish conquest and settlement =Initial explorations= upright European contacts with the indigenous population of Honduras began with the final voyage of Christopher Columbus. In 1502 Columbus sailed past the Islas de la Bahía (Bay Islands) and shortly thereafter reached the mainland of Central America. While at one of the islands, Columbus discovered and seized a large canoe loaded with a wide variety of trade goods. Evidence seems to indicate that the canoe's occupants were Mayan traders and that their encounter with Columbus marked his first direct contact with the civilizations of Mexican and northern Central America. Despite the fact that the canoe had been observed coming from the west, Columbus turned east and then south, sailing away from the civilizations and doing little exploring on the Honduran coast. His only direct legacy was the assigning of a few place names on the Caribbean coast, notably Guanaja for one of the Islas de la Bahía, Cabo Gracias a Dios for the eastern extremity of Honduras, and Honduras (depths in Spanish) for the overall region. The latter name suggests the deep waters off the northern coast.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The initial explorations\\"). Little exploration took place for the next two decades. Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez Pinzón probably touched on part of the Honduran coast in 1508 but devoted most of their efforts to exploring farther north. Some expeditions from the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola may have reached the mainland and certainly began to decimate the population of the Islas de la Bahía in the second decade of the century, but otherwise the Honduran Caribbean coast was a neglected area. Interest in the mainland was dramatically revived as a result of the expedition of Hernán Cortés to Mexico. While Cortés was completing his conquest of the Aztec, expeditions from Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean began to move into Central America. In 1523 part of an expedition headed by Gil González Dávila discovered the Golfo de Fonseca on the Pacific coast, naming it in honor of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca. The following year, four separate Spanish land expeditions began the conquest of Honduras. =Era of the conquistadors= upright The nearly simultaneous invasions of Honduras in 1524 by rival Spanish expeditions began an era of conflict among rival Spanish claimants as well as with the indigenous population. The major initial expeditions were led by Gil González Dávila, who hoped to carve out a territory for his own rule, and by Cristóbal de Olid, who was dispatched from Cuba by Cortés. Once in Honduras, however, Olid succumbed to personal ambition and attempted to establish his own independent authority. Word of this reached Cortés in Mexico, and to restore his own authority, he ordered yet another expedition, this one under the command of Francisco de Las Casas. Then, doubting the trustworthiness of any subordinate, Cortés set out for Honduras himself. The situation was further complicated by the entry into Honduras of expeditions from Guatemala under Pedro de Alvarado and from Nicaragua under Hernando de Soto.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The era of the conquistadors\\"). In the initial struggle for power, Olid seemed to gain the upper hand, capturing both González Dávila and Las Casas. His captives, however, having managed to subvert the loyalty of some of Olid's men, took Olid prisoner, and then promptly beheaded him. Although later condemned for this action by a Mexican court, none of the conspirators ever suffered any real punishment. The arrival of Cortés in Honduras in 1525 temporarily restored some order to the Spanish conquest. He established his own authority over the rival claimants, obtained the submission of numerous indigenous chiefs, and tried to promote the creation of Spanish towns. His own headquarters was located at Trujillo on the Caribbean coast. In April 1526, Cortés returned to Mexico, and the remaining Spaniards resumed their strife. Some order was again restored in October of that year when the first royal governor, Diego López de Salcedo, arrived. López de Salcedo's policies, however, drove many indigenous people, once pacified by Cortés, into open revolt. His attempt to extend his jurisdiction into Nicaragua resulted in his imprisonment by the authorities there. After agreeing to a Nicaraguan-imposed definition of the boundary between the two provinces, López de Salcedo was released but did not return to Honduras until 1529. The early 1530s were not prosperous for Honduras. Renewed fighting among the Spaniards, revolts, and decimation of the settled indigenous population through disease, mistreatment, and exportation of large numbers to the Caribbean islands as slaves left the colony on the edge of collapse by 1534. The Spanish crown renamed the depressed province as Honduras-Higueras, subdividing it into two districts. Higueras encompassed the western part while the rest remained known as Honduras. The decline in population of the province continued, and only the direct intervention of Pedro de Alvarado from Guatemala in 1536 kept Higueras from being abandoned. Alvarado was attracted by the prospect of gold in the region, and, with the help of native Guatemalans who accompanied him, he soon developed a profitable gold-mining industry centered in the newly established town of Gracias. The discovery of gold and silver deposits attracted new settlers and increased the demand for indigenous labor. The enforced labor, however, led to renewed resistance by the native people that culminated in a major uprising in 1537. The leader of the uprising was a capable young Lenca chieftain known as Lempira (after whom the Honduran national monetary unit would eventually be named). Lempira established his base on a fortified hill known as the Peñol de Cerquín and until 1538 successfully defeated all efforts to subdue him. Inspired by his examples, other native inhabitants began revolting, and the entire district of Higueras seemed imperiled. Lempira was ultimately murdered while negotiating with the Spaniards. After his death, resistance rapidly disintegrated, although some fighting continued through 1539. The defeat of Lempira's revolt accelerated the decimation of the indigenous population. In 1539 an estimated 15,000 Native Americans remained under Spanish control; two years later, there were only 8,000. Most of these were divided into encomiendas, a system that left the native people in their villages but placed them under the control of individual Spanish settlers. Under terms of the encomienda system, the Spaniards were supposed to provide the indigenous people with religious instruction and collect tribute from them for the crown. In return, the Spaniards were entitled to a supposedly limited use of indigenous labor. As the native population declined, the settlers exploited those remaining even more ruthlessly. This exploitation led to a clash between the Spanish settlers and authorities on one side and on the other side the Roman Catholic Church led by Father Cristóbal de Pedraza, who, in 1542 became the first bishop of Honduras. Bishop Pedraza, like others after him, had little success in his efforts to protect the native people. Failure in the North While the Spanish had great success in the conquest and colonization of the Pacific parts of the country, they had much less success in the north. The northeastern region, known to the Spanish by a Nahuatl name Taguzgalpa, resisted repeated attempts at conquest successfully. Orders or grants for conquest were issued in 1545, 1562, 1567 and 1594, with no appreciable Spanish progress being reported. When these efforts failed, the Spanish attempted to \\"reduce\\" Taguzgalpa and neighboring Tologalpa (located in Nicaragua) through missionary efforts that began in 1604 and continued intermittently throughout the remainder of the Spanish period. In their efforts the missionaries sought to convert the inhabitants to Christianity and to persuade them to settle in missionary supervised new villages. While some reported conversions in the thousands, the total number resettled never amount to more than a few hundred. On the eastern side of the north coast, the Spanish had more luck. The earliest settlers established coastal ports at Puerto de Caballos (today's Puerto Cortés), Trujillo and Gracias a Dios, as well as interior posts at San Pedro Sula and Naco. The latter experienced some growth during a brief gold rush in the 16th century, but in subsequent periods declined. There is some evidence that the Spanish presence was fairly strictly limited to just these towns and that a fairly thickly settled countryside was completely outside their control. However, in much of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish on the Pacific side shipped good across the uncontrolled space to the ports for trans-shipment to Spain. The failure of the Spanish to control the north coast left the region open to outsiders who were prepared to work with the local people against Spanish interests, and thus northern Europeans began trading and eventually settling in the northern areas during the various wars between England, the Netherlands and Spain of the period 1580 to 1625. Colonial Honduras =Spread of colonization and growth of mining= The defeat of Lempira's revolt, the establishment of the bishopric (first at Trujillo, then at Comayagua after Pedraza's death), and the decline in fighting among rival Spanish factions all contributed to expanded settlement and increased economic activity in the 1540s. A variety of agricultural activities was developed, including cattle ranching and, for a time, the harvesting of large quantities of sarsaparilla root. But the key economic activity of 16th-century Honduras was mining gold and silver.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The spread of colonization and the growth of mining\\"). The initial mining centers were located near the Guatemalan border, around Gracias. In 1538 these mines produced significant quantities of gold. In the early 1540s, the center for mining shifted eastward to the Río Guayape Valley, and silver joined gold as a major product. This change contributed to the rapid decline of Gracias and the rise of Comayagua as the center of colonial Honduras. The demand for labor also led to further revolts and accelerated the decimation of the native population. As a result, African slavery was introduced into Honduras, and by 1545 the province may have had as many as 2,000 slaves. Other gold deposits were found near San Pedro Sula and the port of Trujillo. By the late 1540s, Honduras seemed headed for relative prosperity and influence, a development marked by the establishment in 1544 of the regional audiencia of Guatemala with its capital at Gracias, Honduras. The audiencia was a Spanish governmental unit encompassing both judicial and legislative functions whose president held the additional titles of governor and captain general (hence the alternative name of Captaincy General of Guatemala). The location of the capital was bitterly resented by the more populous centers in Guatemala and El Salvador, and in 1549 the capital of the audiencia was moved to Antigua, Guatemala. Mining production began to decline in the 1560s, and Honduras rapidly declined in importance. The subordination of Honduras to the Captaincy General of Guatemala had been reaffirmed with the move of the capital to Antigua, and the status of Honduras as a province within the Captaincy General of Guatemala would be maintained until independence. Beginning in 1569, new silver strikes in the interior briefly revived the economy and led to the founding of the town of Tegucigalpa, which soon began to rival Comayagua as the most important town in the province. But the silver boom peaked in 1584, and economic depression returned shortly thereafter. Mining efforts in Honduras were hampered by a lack of capital and labor, difficult terrain, the limited size of many gold and silver deposits, and bureaucratic regulations and incompetence. Mercury, vital to the production of silver, was constantly in short supply; once an entire year's supply was lost through the negligence of officials. By the 17th century, Honduras had become a poor and neglected backwater of the Spanish colonial empire, having a scattered population of mestizos, native people, blacks, and a handful of Spanish rulers and landowners. =Colonial society, economy, and government= Although mining provided much of the limited revenue Honduras generated for the Spanish crown, a majority of the inhabitants were engaged in agriculture. Attempts to promote agricultural exports had limited success, however, and most production remained on a subsistence level. If anything, the province became more rural during the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result of economic declines or foreign attacks, several town governments simply ceased to function during this period.Haggerty & Millet (\\"Colonial society, economy, and government\\"). The cattle industry was probably the most important agricultural activity. Much of the cattle industry was on a small scale, but by 1714 six ranchers in the areas of the present-day departments of Yoro and Olancho owned over 1,000 head of cattle each. Some of the cattle were driven to Guatemala for sale. Such sales, however, occasionally produced meat shortages in Honduras and led to conflicts between Guatemalan and Honduran provincial officials. Much of the Honduran interior remained uncolonized and outside of effective Spanish control during the colonial era. The Jicaque, fleeing into the hills, managed to retain considerable cultural autonomy. Other indigenous groups, however, were increasingly brought under Spanish influence and began to lose their separate identities. This assimilation was facilitated by occasional expeditions of government and church officials into new areas. One such expedition into Yoro in 1689 found forty villages of native people living outside of effective Spanish control. Philip V and subsequent Bourbon rulers of Spain brought change to Hondurasthumbupright By the end of the 17th century, governing Honduras had become a frustrating, thankless task. Only Comayagua, with 144 families, and Tegucigalpa, with 135, had over 100 Spanish settlers. The province boasted little in the way of education or culture. The lack of good ports, especially on the Pacific coast, limited contacts with the outside world. Whenever possible, the Spanish colonists forced native people to move to the Tegucigalpa area, where they were available for labor in the mines. However, illegal resettlement and corruption in the mining industry—where every available ruse was used to avoid paying taxes—created a constant series of problems for colonial authorities. Smuggling, especially on the Caribbean coast, was also a serious problem. Early in the 18th century, the Bourbon Dynasty, linked to the rulers of France, replaced the Habsburgs on the throne of Spain and brought change to Honduras. The new dynasty began a series of reforms throughout the empire designed to make administration more efficient and profitable and to facilitate the defense of the colonies. Among these reforms was a reduction in the tax on precious minerals and in the cost of mercury, which was a royal monopoly. In Honduras these reforms contributed to a revival of the mining industry in the 1730s. Efforts to promote the Honduran tobacco industry as a royal monopoly proved less effective and encountered stiff local opposition. The same was true of plans to improve tax collection. Ultimately, the Bourbons abolished most of the corrupt local governmental units, replacing them in 1787 with a system of intendencias (the name of the new local unit and also its administrator, a royal official who supervised tax collections and commercial matters, controlled prices and credit, and exercised some judicial functions). =Anglo-Spanish rivalry= A major problem for Spanish rulers of Honduras was the activity of the English along the northern Caribbean coast. These activities began in the late 16th century and continued into the 19th century. In the early years, Dutch as well as English corsairs (pirates) attacked the Caribbean coast, but as time passed the threat came almost exclusively from the English. In 1643 one English expedition destroyed the town of Trujillo, the major port for Honduras, leaving it virtually abandoned for over a century.Haggerty & Millet (\\"Anglo- Spanish rivalry\\"). Destructive as they were, raiding expeditions were lesser problems than other threats. Beginning in the 17th century, English efforts to plant colonies along the Caribbean coast and in the Islas de la Bahía threatened to cut Honduras off from the Caribbean and raised the possibility of the loss of much of its territory. The English effort on the Honduran coast was heavily dependent on the support of groups known as the Zambo and the Miskito, racially mixed peoples of Native American and African ancestry who were usually more than willing to attack Spanish settlements. British settlers were interested largely in trading, lumbering, and producing pitch. During the numerous 18th-century wars between Britain and Spain, however, the British crown found any activity that challenged Spanish hegemony on the Caribbean coast of Central America to be desirable. Fort at thumb Major British settlements were established at Cabo Gracias a Dios and to the west at the mouth of the Río Sico, as well as on the Islas de la Bahía. By 1759 a Spanish agent estimated the population in the Río Sico area as 3,706. Under the Bourbons, the revitalized Spanish government made several efforts to regain control over the Caribbean coast. In 1752 a major fort was constructed at San Fernando de Omoa near the Guatemalan border. In 1780 the Spanish returned in force to Trujillo, which they began developing as a base for expeditions against British settlements to the east. During the 1780s, the Spanish regained control over the Islas de la Bahía and drove the majority of the British and their allies out of the area around Black River. A British expedition briefly recaptured Black River, but the terms of the Anglo-Spanish Convention of 1786 gave definitive recognition to Spanish sovereignty over the Caribbean coast. To independence =Collapse of Spanish rule= In the early 19th century, Spanish power went into rapid decline. Although Spain was allied with France during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1808 Napoleon Bonaparte forced the Spanish king to abdicate and put a Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. In response, Spanish people erupted in revolt in Madrid and throughout Spain, setting off a chain of uprisings in Latin America. In Honduras, resentment against rule by the exiled Spanish king increased rapidly, especially because increased taxes for Spain's struggle against the French threatened the cattle industry. In 1812 disturbances that broke out in Tegucigalpa were more linked to long-standing rivalry with Comayagua, however, than to opposition to Spanish rule. The disturbances were quickly controlled, and, to appease local discontent, the municipal government of Tegucigalpa was reestablished.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The collapse of Spanish rule\\"). The rivalry between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua helped precipitate the final collapse of Spanish authority in Honduras. A new Spanish administration attempted to transfer Comayagua's tobacco factory to Tegucigalpa. This move led to defiance by Comayagua, which refused to acknowledge the authority of the government in Guatemala. The weakened Spanish government was unable to end Comayagua's defiance, and for a time civil strife threatened to break out. Conflict was averted by the decision made by all the Central American provinces on September 15, 1821, to declare their independence from Spain. This action failed to resolve the dispute between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua, however; the former now urged the creation of a unified Central American state, while the latter favored union with the First Mexican Empire under the rule of General Agustín de Iturbide. Ultimately, Comayagua's position prevailed, and in early 1822 the Central American provinces declared their allegiance to Mexico. This union lasted just over a year and produced few if any benefits for either party. In March 1823, Iturbide was overthrown in Mexico, and the empire was replaced by a republic. The Central American Congress, in which Comayagua but not Tegucigalpa was represented, was quickly convened. With little debate, the United Provinces of Central America declared their independence from Mexico. Mexico's only effort to reverse this decision consisted in maintaining control over Chiapas, the northernmost of the six previous provinces of Central America. thumb From its 1823 inception, the new federation (the United Provinces of Central America) faced a series of ultimately unresolvable problems. Instead of engendering a spirit of unity, Spanish rule had fostered divisions and local suspicions. In the case of Honduras, this divisiveness was epitomized by the rivalry between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua. There was even some sentiment for admitting these two cities as separate provinces within the federation, but that proposal was ultimately rejected. In addition, much of the region was suspicious of Guatemalan ambitions to dominate Central America and wished to retain all possible local authority rather than surrender any to a central government.Haggerty & Millet (\\"The United Provinces of Central America\\"). At least equally serious was the division of the politically active population into conservative and liberal factions. The conservatives favored a more centralized government; a proclerical policy, including a church monopoly over education; and a more aristocratic form of government based on traditional Spanish values. The liberals wanted greater local autonomy and a restricted role for the church, as well as political and economic development as in the United States and parts of Western Europe. The conservatives favored keeping native people in their traditional, subservient position, while the liberals aimed at eventually eliminating indigenous society by incorporating it into the national, Hispanic culture. At the time of Central American independence (1823), Honduras was among the least-developed and least-populated provinces. In 1824 its population was estimated at just over 137,000. Despite its meager population, Honduras produced two of the most prominent leaders of the federation, the liberal Francisco Morazán (nicknamed the \\"George Washington of Central America\\") and the conservative José Cecilio del Valle. In 1823 del Valle was narrowly defeated by liberal Manuel José Arce for election as the federation's first president. Morazán overthrew Arce in 1829 and was elected president of the federation in 1830, defeating del Valle. The beginning of Morazán's administration in 1830 saw some efforts to reform and promote education. Success was limited, however, because of lack of funds and internal fighting. In the elections of 1834, del Valle defeated Morazán, but del Valle died before taking office, and the legislature offered Morazán the presidency. With clerical support, a conservative uprising began in Guatemala in 1837, and within a year the federation had begun to dissolve. On May 30, 1838, the Central American Congress removed Morazán from office, declared that the individual states could establish their own governments, and on July 7 recognized these as \\"sovereign, free, and independent political bodies.\\" For Honduras, the period of federation had been disastrous. Local rivalries and ideological disputes had produced political chaos and disrupted the economy. The British had taken advantage of the chaotic condition to reestablish their control over the Islas de la Bahía. As a result, Honduras wasted little time in formally seceding from the federation once it was free to do so. Independence was declared on November 15, 1838.

Unrequited love or one-sided love is love that is not openly reciprocated or understood as such by the beloved. The beloved may not be aware of the admirer's deep and strong romantic affection, or may consciously reject it. The Merriam Webster Online Dictionary defines unrequited as \\"not reciprocated or returned in kind\\". Psychiatrist Eric Berne states in his book Sex in Human Loving that \\"Some say that one-sided love is better than none, but like half a loaf of bread, it is likely to grow hard and moldy sooner.\\" Others, however, like the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, considered that \\"indispensable...to the lover is his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference.\\"This is how R. B. Pippin describes Nietzsche's views in The Persistence of Subjectivity (2005) p. 326. It can also be contrasted with redamancy or the act of reciprocal love. Analysis =Route to unrequited love= According to Dr. Roy Baumeister, what makes a man or woman desirable, of course, is a complex and highly personal mix of many qualities and traits. But falling for someone who is much more desirable than oneself, whether because of physical beauty or attributes like charm, intelligence, wit or status, Baumeister calls this kind of mismatch \\"prone to find their love unrequited\\" and that such relationships are falling upward. According to some psychologists, opposites do attract, but it is not possible to attract those whose moral values are different. 'Platonic friendships provide a fertile soil for unrequited love'.Spitzberg, p. 311 Thus the object of unrequited love is often a friend or acquaintance, someone regularly encountered in the workplace, during the course of work, school or other activities involving large groups of people. This creates an awkward situation in which the admirer has difficulty in expressing their true feelings, a fear that revelation of feelings might invite rejection, cause embarrassment or might end all access to the beloved, as a romantic relationship may be inconsistent with the existing association. =Unrequited love victims= The inability of the unrequited lover to express or declare their love often leads to negative feelings such as depression, low self- esteem, anxiety and rapid mood swings between depression and euphoria. =Rejectors= 'There are two bad sides to unrequited love, but only one is made familiar by our culture'\\"To love or be loved in vain: The trials and tribulations of unrequited love.

(1998)Spitzberg, p. 308 – that of the lover, not the rejector. In fact, research suggests that the object of unrequited affection experiences a variety of negative emotions on a par with those of the suitor, including anxiety, frustration, and guilt. As Freud long since pointed out, 'when a woman sues for love, to reject and refuse is a distressing part for a man to play'.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 9 In popular culture Unrequited love has been a frequent subject in popular culture. Movies, books and songs often portray the would-be lover's persistence as paying off when the rejector comes to his or her senses. The presence of this script makes it easy to understand why an unrequited lover persists in the face of rejection.B. H. Spitzberg/W. R. Cupach, The Dark Side of Close Relationships (1998) p. 251 In the traditional Welsh folk song Cariad Cywir, the protagonist persists in unrequited love happily despite being continuously ignored. However, there have been other depictions in which the unrequited lover commits suicide, as in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's novella The Sorrows of Young Werther or in the traditional British Isles folk ballad I Once Loved a Lass. In Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind the main character Scarlett O'Hara feels unrequited love towards Ashley Wilkes. In Billy Bragg's song The Saturday Boy, the young protagonist looks up the word \\"unrequited\\" in the dictionary whilst in the state of unrequited love. One of the better examples of unrequited love is Frank Ocean's \\"Bad Religion\\". \\"Johnny Angel\\", a number one hit song by singer and actress Shelley Fabares, has a relatively notable example of unrequited love. According to the lyrics of this song, a girl falls in love with a boy who doesn't even know that she exists. She even declines countless dates with other boys, just to fully concentrate on the boy she loves. And she has dreams about what the world would be like if the boy loves her. In its sequel, \\"Johnny Loves Me\\", also by Fabares, the girl later wins the boy's heart, convincing him to believe that the girl does exist. The comics strip Peanuts features multiple different characters engaged in unrequited love relationships. Commenting on the abundance of unrequited love in the series, author Charles Schulz said that he did not know why there is so much unrequited love, but it is something everyone can relate to. Unrequited Love is a pop album by actress singer songwriter Hillary Hawkins with songs such as \\"Missing You\\".https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Missing- You-is-2-Nickelodeon-Stars-1-Music-Video-20190903 Advantages Dante looks longingly at Beatrice Portinari (in yellow) as she passes by him with Lady Vanna (in red) in Dante and Beatrice, by Henry Holiday Unrequited love has long been depicted as noble, an unselfish and stoic willingness to accept suffering. Literary and artistic depictions of unrequited love may depend on assumptions of social distance that have less relevance in western, democratic societies with relatively high social mobility and less rigid codes of sexual fidelity. Nonetheless, the literary record suggests a degree of euphoria in the feelings associated with unrequited love, which has the advantage as well of carrying none of the responsibilities of mutual relationships: certainly, \\"rejection, apparent or real, may be the catalyst for inspired literary creation... 'the poetry of frustration'.\\"Mary Ward, The Literature of Love (2009) p. 45-6 Eric Berne considered that \\"the man who is loved by a woman is lucky indeed, but the one to be envied is he who loves, however little he gets in return.

Past relations As a result of the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, which ended the Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was transferred to Japan and was promptly made a Japanese colony. Foreign consulates resumed their activities on Formosa, 2 including Russian activities in 1896. The first Russian consul was the German native Paul Shabert. Both the Republic of China and the Soviet Union were the founding members of the United Nations and the Security Council in 1945. After the end of the Korean War in 1954, the US signed a security treaty with the government of the Republic of China, which included a clause providing for American participation in military action in case of confrontation with mainland China. The Soviet Union minister of foreign affairs in a statement called the treaty a “rude violation of international agreements, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the PRC.” All contact between the USSR and the Republic of China defined by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 1945 was broken off. The announcement of the breakup was made on October 3, 1949 after the Soviet Union became the first country to recognize the PRC in October. Although there have been some weak tendencies towards change in the status quo since the late 1950s, up to this day, the Russian Federation has had no official relations with Taiwan. It is worth mentioning that the USSR had always adhered to the policy of “one China” but insisted on a political solution to deal with the crisis, unlike some Beijing leaders who were considering military action in 1954 and 1958. Possibly, it was one of the reasons for the cooling of Sino Soviet relations at the end of the 1950s. When in September 1954 bombardment of the Taiwan-adjacent islands provoked the first of the three Matszu-Amoi crises, the Soviet Union in Nikita Khrushchev’s statement officially announced its support of the PRC. At the same time, Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov expressed concern that the regional conflict would turn into a major war, while accusing the United States of provoking the conflict. Not long before the crisis in 1954, Taiwan’s coast guard captured Soviet oil tanker “Tuapse,” which was on course from Odessa to Vladivostok. Forty-nine crew members were arrested, four of whom later managed to escape and returned home. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union called for the Ten Nations Summit in New Delhi to discuss the issue on 27 September 1958 as one of the precursors of the later Sino-Soviet split. Unofficial contact between the USSR and Taiwan started at the end of the 1960s, after the tendency toward a US-PRC rapprochement had become obvious. It is well known that the visits by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger resulted in the signing of the so-called Shanghai communiqué in 1972 when it was declared that the US “acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China.” Meanwhile, Taiwan hoped that a Soviet- Taiwanese rapprochement would prevent the rising number of Sino-American contacts. It is possible that the USSR in its turn considered that restoration of relations with the ROC would help to slow down the aggravation in Soviet- PRC relations. Taiwan was eager to compromise since after the weakening of its relations with the US, it had little to lose. The Soviet Union, however, was very careful in its policy towards the ROC, trading with it via Hong Kong, Japan, West Germany, and its East European allies. Present day relations The ROC representative office in Russia, the Representative Office in Moscow for the Taipei-Moscow Economic and Cultural Coordination Commission, was opened on 12 July 1993 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ROC. The Russian representative office in Taiwan, Representative Office in Taipei for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural Cooperation, was opened on 15 December 1996 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. By 2002, the borders of Outer Mongolia were eliminated from the ROC boundary definition in which the Tuva Republic was incorporated in. In 2005, the total amount of the trade between the two countries (in US dollars) was 2,188,944,473. As can be seen from the data, Russia keeps a positive balance in its trade relations with Taiwan thanks to crude oil, cast iron and steel, nonferrous metals, petrochemical products, ferro-alloys, coking coal, timber, and chemical fertilizers. Russia imports mostly electronics and electronic parts, computers and computer parts, and home appliances. The negative trade balance ($1.68 billion in 2005) issue is taken seriously in Taiwan. However, the prevalence of natural resources in Russian exports and industrial products in Taiwan are considered in Taiwan to be logical at the present stage of relations. To improve the situation, it is recommended to increase the export of Taiwanese products to Russia. The relatively low level of Taiwanese exports to Russia can be explained by several factors. Firstly, the price of Taiwanese products is still quite high for most Russian consumers, the rest prefer high- end European, American, or Japanese products. Secondly, there are difficulties and complexities involved in bank transfers, which are mostly conducted through third countries. Thirdly, there is insufficient guarantee from the government for foreign investors. As a result, foreign business, including the Taiwanese, prefers to invest in more stable and predictable regions. It is also worth mentioning that Russia imports many products from the PRC, some of which are in fact made at Taiwanese-owned operations. However, this trade is officially considered in the statistics as part of the Russian-PRC trade.

Its major features include infinite NFS- exportable snapshots, master-multislave operation, configurable history retention, fsckless-mount, and checksums to deal with data corruption. HAMMER also supports data block deduplication, meaning that identical data blocks will be stored only once on a file system. A successor, HAMMER2, was announced in 2011 and became the default in Dragonfly 5.2 (April 2018).  Features  HAMMER file system provides configurable fine-grained and coarse-grained filesystem histories with online snapshots availability. Up to 65536 master (read-write) and slave (read-only) pseudo file systems (PFSs), with independent individual retention parameters and inode numbering, may be created for each file system; PFS may be mirrored to multiple slaves both locally or over network connection with near real-time performance. No file system checking is required on remount. HAMMER supports volumes up to 1 EiB of storage capacity. File system supports CRC checksumming of data and metadata, online layout correction and data deduplication, and dynamic inodes allocation with effectively unlimited number of inodes.  Limitations  Currently, regular maintenance is required to keep the file system clean and regain space after file deletions. By default, a cron job performs the necessary actions on DragonFly BSD daily. HAMMER does not support multi-master configurations.  Performance  HAMMER is optimised to reduce the number of physical IO operations to cover the most likely path, ensuring sequential access for optimal performance. The following performance-related improvements were introduced in : * Increased disk read speed in certain scenarios by implementing pulse-width modulated time-domain multiplexer on B-tree cursor operation * Removed a deadlock stalling issue * Improved read performance during heavy, concurrent file write operations  Development  HAMMER was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD to provide a feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the then increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER was declared production-ready with DragonFly 2.2 in 2009; in 2012, design-level work shifted onto HAMMER2, which was declared stable with DragonFly 5.2 in 2018. , HAMMER is now often referred to as HAMMER1 to avoid confusion with HAMMER2, although an official renaming hasn't happened. Both filesystems are independent of each other due to different on-disk formats, and continue to receive separate updates and improvements independently.

The technology makes it easy to create deeply collaborative and hyperlinked multi-user virtual workspaces, virtual exhibit spaces, and game-based learning and training environments that run on all major software operating systems. By using a peer-to-peer-based message passing protocol to reduce reliance on server infrastructures for support of basic in world interactions across many participants, Open Cobalt makes it possible for people to hyperlink their virtual worlds via 3D portals to form a large distributed network of interconnected collaboration spaces. It also makes it possible for schools and other organizations to freely set up their own networks of public and private 3D virtual workspaces that feature integrated web browsing, voice chat, text chat, and access to remote desktop applications and services. Open Cobalt uses the Squeak software environment, which is an open-source Smalltalk system freely available for Windows, Mac and Unix. As is true of almost any Smalltalk application, Open Cobalt has identical functioning on any supported platform. As a Smalltalk system, it can usually be updated while the system is running without needing a restart. Expected uses Open Cobalt is designed to enable the deployment of secure virtual world spaces that support education, research, and the activities of virtual organizations. By leveraging OpenGL- based 3D graphics, Open Cobalt supports highly scalable collaborative data visualization, virtual learning and problem solving environments, 3D wikis, online gaming environments termed Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), and privately and securely maintained multi-user virtual environments. The Open Cobalt application leverages peer-based messaging to eliminate the need for virtual world servers/commercial services and makes it very simple for end-users to create and securely share deeply collaborative virtual worlds that run on all major software operating systems. Users moving through and interacting within Open Cobalt worlds simultaneously participate and collaborate in a dynamic, concurrent environment where they can work, explore, and learn at a level of integration and extensibility not easily achieved through commercial virtual world technologies. With no licensing fees, users and developers can also freely build and share highly capable multi-user virtual workspaces, game-based learning and training environments, or even just create places to meet and interact with friends. History kmz mesh content imported from Google's 3D Warehouse. Users are able to provision content to Open Cobalt spaces that can be developed and managed using third- party tools and resources. Open Cobalt is derived from the Croquet software development kit (SDK) that was publicly released under the MIT License by Hewlett-Packard and the Croquet Consortium in early 2007.Press Release for the Croquet SDK 1.0 In early 2008, and with the support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,Announcement of the 2007 Mellon Advanced Technology Collaboration (MATC) Award to Duke University Julian Lombardi and Mark P. McCahill, at Duke University, launched the community-based software development effort to build Open Cobalt as an open-source virtual world browser application and construction toolkit. In May 2008, Lombardi was awarded a National Science Foundation grantNSF Award Abstract #0823393: An Open and Scalable Croquet- Based Collaboration Infrastructure for Support of 3-D Simulation-Based Research and Education to further strengthen the community-based software development effort and bring the Open Cobalt virtual world browser to its alpha release. Together with John Dougan as technical project lead and a growing international community of software developers and volunteers, the Open Cobalt project contributors released Open Cobalt Alpha in April 2010. OpenCobalt 1.0 alpha 22 was released in June 2015. Recent activity involving the project can be found in the Open Cobalt Google Group. Goals The goals of the Open Cobalt effort are to stimulate the use of distributed virtual environments, advance visual simulations, and deepen collaboration in education, research, and personal entertainment - and in so doing to: # stimulate the development and dissemination of shared cyberenvironments for the staging, observation and evaluation of collaborative decision-making, problem finding, and problem solving among members of distributed virtual organizations and educational communities, and # create the conditions for the emergence of a free, open, and scalable 3D-enabled global information space. Features Open Cobalt is both an end-user application and full featured software development environment for creating a rich network of end-user created interlinked virtual worlds. It is more extensible than the proprietary technologies behind collaborative worlds such as Second Life, and before that ViOS. This is because: *It is free (there are no fees for its use or distribution) *The entire system is open-source (it is licensed under the MIT free software license) *It does not need the use of servers to create and share virtual worlds (since it is based on a peer-to-peer synchronization architecture/messaging protocol) *It is platform and device independent (because it is a virtual machine-based technology that runs on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux) *It provides a complete professional programmer's language (Smalltalk/Squeak, IDE, and class library in every distributed, running participant's copy (with the programming environment itself being simultaneously shareable and extensible) *It is based on Squeak's late-binding architecture and metaprogramming facilities (that allow for efficient handling of media) *Users/developers within virtual worlds may freely access, modify and view the source code of the entire system (they can access running code from in-world) *Users/developers can import 3D content directly into their worlds (Google 3D Warehouse content (.kmz) and content in other formats can be drag-and-dropped directly into Open Cobalt worlds) *Users/developers can import a variety of media content directly into their worlds (Open Cobalt worlds support audio and mpeg media content) *Its software code can be updated/changed while the system is live (making it possible to program worlds from within worlds while they are running) *It is not hosted on a single organization's server (and hence not governed by any such organization) =3D hyperlinking= Open Cobalt 3D hyperlinks connecting five different virtual spaces. Three-dimensional hyperlinks appear as navigable portals and enable Open Cobalt worlds to be organized by end-users into an interlinked network of virtual spaces across local and wide area networks. Unlike most other virtual world platforms (with the exception of OpenSimulator's Hypergrid architecture), Open Cobalt uses a method of hyperlinking, known as \\"space- linking\\", which resembles a window frame or portal and, when revolved, shows a 360-degree real-time view of one region to a user in another region; such portals can also be walked through by users. Space-linking is an alternative to teleportation, a more common means of traversing between regions or spaces, and is also a primary means of travelling between whole grids. Like MediaWiki's redlinks, such portals are also used to link to uncreated spaces or regions (colored in black) in order to indicate the need to create newer spaces.Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces =Remote collaboration= Two users' avatars accessing a single VNC session within a secure and collaborative Open Cobalt space. Integration of VNC with Open Cobalt makes it possible for users to collaboratively access the desktops and applications running on remote machines anywhere on the network. *Enterprise directory access; Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) *Works over local area networks (LAN) and within Intranets *Integrated text chat; Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) *In-world voice chat; Voice over IP (VoIP) *In-world video chat *In-world web browsing; via Virtual Network Computing (VNC) *In-world annotations (text and audio) *Collaborative document sharing/editing =Filetype support= *Mesh and texture import (.kmz, .obj, .ase, .vrml) *Media import (.mpg) *Scripting (Smalltalk/Squeak) *Custom avatars/animation (via Collada/Ogre 3D workflows) *OpenGL-based graphics engine *OpenAL Technical functions Open Cobalt is an application built using the Open Croquet software developer's toolkit. Its relationship to Open Croquet provides it with a number of powerful capabilities. =Programming environment= Open Cobalt's software development environment enables programmers to enjoy the capabilities of a true late bound, message sending language. Because it is built on Squeak/Croquet, Open Cobalt is a purely object-oriented programming system that allows for significant flexibility in its design and implementation. Within Open Cobalt, programmers may edit the source code of the 3D world from within the world, and immediately see the result while the world is still running. The running program does not have to be ended, and there is no compile-link-run-debug development loop. Any part of the program may be edited, down to the virtual machine (VM) and OpenGL calls. Open Cobalt's reliance on Squeak's generalized storage allocator and garbage collector makes it highly efficient in real-time and allows reshaping of objects to be done safely. As with Squeak, Open Cobalt supports many non- English languages and fonts such as German, Spanish, French, and Japanese. =Synchronization architecture= Open Cobalt's programming environment. A complete professional programmer's language (Smalltalk/Squeak), IDE, and class library is present in every distributed, running participant's copy. Underlying Open Cobalt is an object-oriented semantics based on active objects that have the capability of temporal reflection. Each object is aware of, and in direct control, of its behavior in time. Open Cobalt also directly supports replication of computation, allowing computation to be moved close to the point of interaction on demand, while maintaining a consistent view of behaviors that can scale to include thousands of nodes. It does this by using a combination of object semantics along with a modified version of David P. Reed's TeaTime peer-based messaging protocol as a distributed message transactional system enabling replicated computation (synchronization) across multiple peers. This makes replicated computation as easily as replicating data - and makes synchronization of all events across multiple peers a fundamental property of the system. Owing to these properties, software developers can use Open Cobalt as a way of creating deeply collaborative applications without the effort needed to understand how replicated applications work. This reduces the programming overhead needed for widespread deployment of deeply capable collaborative virtual spaces. It also makes it possible to deploy and coordinate the activities of virtual worlds on multiple machines without the need to maintain central server resources (other than those needed for specialized data and institutional middleware services). Open Cobalt's implementation of TeaTime includes: # A coordinated universal time- base embedded in the communication protocol, # Replicated, versioned objects that unify replicated computation and distribution of results, # Replication strategies that separate the mechanisms of replication from the behavioral semantics of objects, # Deadline-based scheduling extended with failure and nesting, # Coordinated, distributed two-phase commit that is used to control the progress of computations at multiple sites, to provide resilience, deterministic results, and adaptation to available resources, # Use of distributed sets.

The manga was adapted into an anime series from Studio Deen in 1997. It was licensed for release in North America by Bandai and released in 2000 as a two-disc set with only subtitles. The series is currently unlicensed and out-of-print. Plot It is about a boy named Techno who lived in a bomb shelter most of his life. He and his grandfather are amazingly smart. But one day Techno sees a girl named Hitomi on his yard. He instantly falls in love. He names her Daisy, even though she keeps telling him that's not her name. After 3 months of practice on a robot he decides to get a relationship started with her. But all he can do is stare. Then he decides to get full ownership of her, but she still doesn't really belong to Techno. Along their way on this crazy relationship, Techno's genius almost kills Hitomi multiple times. That includes making her 50 feet tall, making a replacement teacher that shoots laser beams, creating a giant slug, kidnapping her, and much more. More crazy things include a teacher that wears weird costumes, a harmless boy rebel that is wanted dead by Techno, his mom, and brother, Techno's over protective grandfather, Hitomi's friends, an android that wants Techno dead and to protect Hitomi, the 2 missiles that Techno befriended, and the rest of the class.

The eight hospitals are: Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai Brooklyn, Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Queens, Mount Sinai Morningside (formerly Mount Sinai St. Luke's), Mount Sinai West (formerly Mount Sinai Roosevelt), New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, and Mount Sinai South Nassau. The Health System includes more than 6,600 primary and specialty care physicians and 13 ambulatory surgical centers. It has ambulatory practices throughout the five boroughs of New York City, Westchester County, and Long Island, along with more than 30 affiliated community health centers.Mount Sinai Facts & Figures In the 2017-2018 fiscal year, the Health System employed more than 39,000 people and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai had 33 multidisciplinary research, educational, and clinical institutes. In addition, the Health System reported 3,360 beds among its seven hospitals as well as 136,528 inpatient admissions, 500,901 Emergency Department visits, and more than 14,700 babies delivered. History The Mount Sinai Health System began as a single hospital, founded in 1852 and opened in 1855 as The Jews' Hospital. In 1864, the hospital became formally nonsectarian and in 1866 changed its name to The Mount Sinai Hospital. The hospital is one of the oldest and largest teaching hospitals in the U.S. The hospital campus is located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, beside Central Park. =Educational expansion= In 1881, the Mount Sinai Hospital established a training school for doctors and nurses. Prior to its establishment the hospital had been served by untrained male and female attendants. The school closed in September 1971 amid financial difficulties and a failed plan to affiliate with the City College of New York. The charter was taken up by The Mount Sinai Hospital School of Continuing Education in Nursing, founded in the fall of 1975. In 1963 The Mount Sinai Hospital chartered The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the first medical school to grow out of a non-university in more than 50 years. The school opened to students in 1968 and in 2012 changed its name to Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.Icahn School of Medicine Facts & Figured The school and the hospital together formed the Mount Sinai Health Center. In 2013, Phillips School of Nursing at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, founded in 1902, became the nursing school of the Mount Sinai Health System.https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/beth-israel/pson/about/dean- message =Mount Sinai Queens= thumb In 1993, Astoria General Hospital located on 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, became an affiliate of The Mount Sinai Hospital. A year later the hospital's name changed to Western Queens Community Hospital. In 1999, the hospital was purchased by Mount Sinai and had its name changed again, this time to Mount Sinai Queens, becoming the first community hospital to bear the Mount Sinai name. =Continuum Health Partners= thumb On January 9, 1997, St. Luke’s-Roosevelt entered into a partnership with Beth Israel Medical Center forming the Greater Metropolitan Health Systems, Inc. In April 1998, Greater Metropolitan Health Systems, Inc. was renamed Continuum Health Partners. The entity served as a parent corporation while the two hospital centers continued as separate business entities with their own constituent hospital campuses. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, located on Second Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan joined Continuum in 2000. With a total combined annual operating budget of $2.1 billion, Continuum hospitals delivered inpatient care through nearly 3,100 certified beds located in seven major facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn, while providing outpatient care in private practice settings and ambulatory centers. Continuum treated patients in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Westchester County. Contract dispute with Aetna In April 2010, Aetna notified policyholders that it was in a contract dispute with Continuum Health Partners and that the contract would lapse as of June 5, 2010. The June 5 date passed and the contract lapsed. Continuum Health Partners provided subscribers with a form to request that Aetna retain their physicians for one year or until the policy period ended.\\"Attention: Aetna patients\\" On July 28, 2010, Continuum Health Partners announced a new agreement with Aetna. Within this agreement, it was noted that the effective date would be retroactive to the April 5, 2010, termination date.http://www.wehealny.org/AetnaAgreement.pdf Continuum and Mount Sinai merger In September 2013, Continuum announced a merger with the Mount Sinai Medical Center.

Cruzipain can help parasites escape the response from the adaptive immune system by interfering with the functions of immunoglobulins from the immunoglobin G subclasses. These immunoglobulins are bound to receptors and cruzipain interacts with these immunoglobulins by cleaving their hinges. During smooth muscle cell invasion, cruzipain may mobilize vasoconstricting endothelin receptors, which may interfere with the vasoconstrictor's ability to cause the blood vessels to become narrower.

Persister cells in their dormancy do not divide. The tolerance shown in persister cells differs from antimicrobial resistance in that the tolerance is not inherited and is reversible. When treatment has stopped the state of dormancy can be reversed and the cells can reactivate and multiply. Most persister cells are bacterial, and there are also fungal persister cells, yeast persister cells, and cancer persister cells that show tolerance for cancer drugs. History Recognition of bacterial persister cells dates back to 1944 when Joseph Bigger, an Irish physician working in England, was experimenting with the recently discovered penicillin. Bigger used penicillin to lyse a suspension of bacteria and then inoculate a culture medium with the penicillin-treated liquid. Colonies of bacteria were able to grow after antibiotic exposure. The important observation that Bigger made was that this new population could again be almost eliminated by the use of penicillin except for a small residual population. Hence the residual organisms were not antibiotic resistant mutants but rather a subpopulation of what he called ‘persisters’. The formation of bacterial persisters is now known to be a common phenomenon that can occur by the formation of persister cells prior to the antibiotic treatment or in response to a variety of antibiotics. Relevance to chronic infections Antimicrobial tolerance is achieved by a small subpopulation of microbial cells termed persisters. Persisters are not mutants, but rather are dormant cells that can survive the antimicrobials that effectively eliminate their much greater number. Persister cells have entered a non-growing, or extremely slow-growing physiological state which makes them tolerant (insensitive or refractory) to the action of antimicrobials. When such persisting pathogenic microbes cannot be eliminated by the immune system, they become a reservoir from which recurrence of infection will develop. Such non-growing bacteria have been observed to persist during infections from Salmonella. Persister cells are the main cause of relapsing and chronic infections. The bacteria species Listeria monocytogenes the main causal agent of listeriosis, has been shown to demonstrate persistence during infection in hepatocyte and trophoblast cells. The usual active lifestyle can change and the bacteria can remain in intracellular vacuoles entering into a slow non- growing state of persistence thus promoting their survival from antibiotics. Fungal persister cells are a common cause of recurring infections due to Candida albicans a common biofilm infection of implants. Medical importance Antibiotic tolerance poses medically important challenges. It is largely responsible for the inability to eradicate bacterial infections with antibiotic treatment. Persister cells are highly enriched in biofilms, and this makes biofilm-related diseases difficult to treat. Examples are chronic infections of implanted medical devices such as catheters and artificial joints, urinary tract infections, middle ear infections and fatal lung disease . Resistance vs tolerance Unlike multiple drug resistance, and antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial tolerance is transient, and not inherited. Antibiotic tolerant persister cells are not antibiotic resistant mutants. Resistance is caused by newly acquired genetic traits (by mutation or horizontal gene transfer) that are heritable and confer the ability to grow at elevated concentrations of antibiotics. In contrast, tolerant bacteria have the same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as susceptible bacteria, and differ in the duration of the treatment that they can survive. Antibiotic tolerance can be caused by a reversible physiological state in a small subpopulation of genetically identical cells, similar to a differentiated cell type. It enables this small subpopulation of bacteria to survive their complete elimination by antibiotic use. Persisting cells resume growth when the antibiotic is removed, and their progeny is sensitive to antibiotics. Molecular mechanisms The molecular mechanisms that underlie persister cell formation, and antimicrobial tolerance are largely unknown. Persister cells are thought to arise spontaneously in a growing microbial population by a stochastic genetic switch, although inducible mechanisms of persister cell formation have been described. For instance, toxin-antitoxin systems, and a number of different stress responses such as the SOS response, the envelope stress response, and the starvation response have also been associated with persister cell formation in biofilms. Owing to their transient nature and relatively low abundance, it is hard to isolate persister cells in sufficient numbers for experimental characterization, and only a few relevant genes have been identified to date. The best-understood persistence factor is the E. coli high persistence gene, commonly abbreviated as hipA. Although tolerance is widely considered a passive state, there is evidence indicating it can be an energy-dependent process. Persister cells in E. coli can transport intracellular accumulations antibiotic using an energy requiring efflux pump called TolC. A persister subpopulation has also been demonstrated in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast persisters are triggered in a small subset of unperturbed exponentially growing cells by spontaneously occurring DNA damage, which leads to the activation of a general stress response and protection against a range of harsh drug and stress environments. As a result of the DNA damage, yeast persisters are also enriched for random genetic mutations that occurred prior to the stress, and are unrelated to the stress survival. In response to antifungals, fungal persister cells activate stress- response pathways, and two stress-protective molecules – glycogen, and trehalose accumulate in large amounts. Potential treatment A study has shown that adding certain metabolites to aminoglycosides could enable bacterial persisters to be eliminated. This study was carried out on a number of bacterial species including E. coli and S. aureus. Phage therapy, where applicable, entirely circumvents antibiotic tolerance.

The USS standard is no longer supported. It, together with the SAE fastener standard, was incorporated into the Unified Thread Standard. However, the term, USS, continues to be used occasionally today to describe inch based threaded fasteners with a coarse thread pitch and inch based washers that are a little bit larger than the corresponding SAE washer. The Unified Thread Standard uses the term UNC (Unified Coarse) to describe a fastener that previously would have been designated USS and the Unified Thread Standard uses the term UNF (Unified Fine) to describe a fastener that would have previously been designated SAE. Thread form The thread form is defined by flats at the tip and root of the thread form. This flat length is defined as the pitch divided by eight. The thread depth, which is from flat to flat is 0.6495 times the pitch. For screws and larger, the pitch is defined as: :P = 0.24 \\\\sqrt {D + 0.625} - 0.175 where P is the pitch and D is the diameter of the rough stock. History and use William Sellers originally developed the USS thread, and set forth many of its details in his paper, \\"A System of Screw Threads and Nuts\\", presented in April 1864 to the Franklin Institute. In 1898, the standard for metric threaded fasteners was established. The metric standard used the same thread geometry as the USS standard but differed in that the dimensions and pitch were based on metric units. In 1906, the A.L.A.M developed what would be the SAE thread standard for threaded fasteners based on the USS standard but with a finer thread pitch. A Unified Thread Standard UNC thread is mechanically interchangeable with a USS thread of the same diameter. However, there are tolerance and other differences between a thread compliant with the USS thread and a Unified Thread Standard UNC thread. The Unified Thread Standard for quarter inch and larger threaded fasteners was adopted on November 18, 1948, and was subsequently adopted for smaller thread series.

Frank Baum, the writer of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The special first aired December 17, 1985 on CBS in the United States, and December 24, 1986 on TV Asahi in Japan under the title Santa's Secret and Great Adventure (サンタの秘密と大冒険, lit. Santa no Himitsu to Dai Bōken). This was Rankin/Bass' final \\"Animagic\\" stop motion production filmed in Japan; later productions would be traditionally animated. Plot Long ago in the Forest of Burzee, a council meeting is held where the Great Ak tells the story of Santa Claus to the leaders of the Immortals, hoping to persuade them to grant Claus immortality. About 60 years earlier, the Great Ak finds an abandoned baby in the snowy woods on the border of the Forest. He gives it to the lioness Shiegra to raise. However, after hearing about the discovery of the infant, Necile, a Wood Nymph, steals him from Shiegra and goes to the Great Ak, begging him to let her raise the child. After initial concern that a human was brought into the Forest which is against the law, the Great Ak allows Necile to raise the child while Shiegra stays to protect them. Necile names the child \\"Claus\\". When Claus has grown to be a young man, the Great Ak takes him to see the mortal world and its cruelty and suffering. Claus learns that he must live there and make it better. He leaves the Forest and lives in a workshop in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho with Shiegra and Tingler, a Sound Imp. As he gets older, he works to bring happiness to children in a nearby village. He eventually makes toys (the first being a wooden black cat modeled after the kitten Blinky that Necile sent to them, which he gives to the orphan boy Weekum). He is occasionally assisted by a group of Ryls, Knooks, and Wood Nymphs from the Forest. Meanwhile, evil creatures called the Awgwas (who influence children to do bad things and who are led by King Awgwa) are not happy with Claus's efforts to bring happiness to children, so they attempt to stop Claus from making and delivering toys. At first, they send a warning to Claus, telling him to stop or they would come for him. After Claus ignores the warning, the Awgwas kidnap him, but he calls for aid from the Knooks, who help him escape. As he and his friends make attempts to deliver toys to the village, the Awgwas repeatedly ambush them and steal the toys. Claus tries to go alone by night, but he is again ambushed. The Great Ak has had enough of this and summons King Awgwa and his followers to come and face him. King Awgwa defies the Great Ak's demand that he stop interfering with Claus's efforts and declares war on the Immortals. Later, the Great Ak and some other Immortals face off against the Awgwas and some monstrous friends that they brought. The monsters attack the Immortals, but the Immortals defeat them. The Immortals then charge toward the Awgwas, who flee in fear. Afterwards, the Great Ak informs Claus that he can resume his toy delivering without fear of interference, because the Awgwas \\"have perished\\". Claus and his friends prepare a sleigh to deliver toys to the village, but it is too heavy for them to pull. Peter Knook comes up with the idea of hitching reindeer from the Forest to the sleigh in order to pull it. Claus travels across the valley in his sleigh along with Tingler and Shiegra. The sleigh makes multiple large leaps which Tingler says is like flying. Claus claims that he now knows why the valley is named the way it is, as he laughs in a \\"ho ho ho\\" manner. When he makes his first stop, he finds that the door of the house is locked since it is night, so he enters through the chimney. Once inside, he finds that the children's stockings were hung by the fireplace to dry, so he decides to put small toys in them while placing larger toys elsewhere. After Claus leaves and the family wakes up, they refer to him as \\"Saint Claus\\" or \\"Santa Claus\\". Once Claus returns, Peter Knook informs him that he can only use the reindeer once a year on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve is only ten days away, so he will not have time to make enough toys. In order for Claus to have enough gifts, Peter Knook finds and retrieves the toys stolen by the Awgwas. Claus sets out on his first of many Christmas Eve sleigh rides. As Claus nears the end of his life, he suggests that his friends remember him by decorating a tree every year. After hearing about Claus's life and good deeds, the council unanimously votes to give him the Mantle of Immortality. Having become known as \\"Santa Claus\\", he delivers gifts to children every Christmas Eve.

Production The Rankin/Bass production truncates much of the story (it ran in a one-hour time slot) and simplifies some of the motivations, but its major alterations from the book are setting up the hearing over the Mantle of Immortality as a frame story explaining just why Claus deserves the mantle, although there is an edit that makes it difficult to realize that the scene in which Ak calls the council when first finding the infant in the woods does not occur in the same time period as the main story. In addition, Shiegra accompanies Claus to the Laughing Valley, in which, unlike the book, it is always Winter. A similar compromise toward popular culture is Claus's now eight reindeer, albeit unnamed. Peter Knook, a rather crusty but amiable fellow, replaces most of the other Knooks, save the Protector (King) and two strangers, and declares \\"only on Christmas Eve\\" for the reindeer without any argument or explanation. One important new character, Tingler, a Sound Imp also accompanies Claus and gives him someone to talk to. When the show premiered, the book was not as easily available, and many Oz fans who only knew of the book were surprised to discover that Tingler was not one of Baum's creations, so true was the character to the author's spirit. Earle Hyman portrayed King Awgwa, and Leslie Miller played Necile. Most of the other voices were performed by Peter Newman and Lynne Lipton. Larry Kenney was the Commander of the Wind Demons, who initially served as a devil's advocate to Ak at the fateful hearing, but soon became the Immortal most approving of giving the Mantle to Claus, and casts the first vote in what proves to be a unanimous decision to that effect. Most of the Immortals' titles were changed to alleviate them all being kings and queens. Screenwriter Julian P. Gardner created a musical production number, \\"Big Surprise\\" as the children at Weekum's orphanage plead Santa Claus for more toy cats. Other songs include the chorus \\"Babe in the Woods\\" and the powerful chant, \\"Ora e Sempre (Today and Forever)\\" representing the immortals. Bernard Hoffer composed the music, as well as setting a quatrain by Baum inspired by Claus's famous laugh. The presentation of the Christmas tree is different; Claus, realizing his death is imminent, decorates a tree with ornaments and suggests it should be his memorial. This is the only Rankin/Bass Christmas special without a celebrity narrator. The special aired on Freeform and since 2018 on AMC currently airs the special. though the Freeform broadcast was heavily edited from its original CBS broadcast, along with most of the other Rankin/Bass animated Christmas specials. The Rankin/Bass production is distributed by Warner Bros. Television. Nielsen ratings Its first airing on December 17, 1985, earned a 12.5 rating and a 19 percent audience share, ranking third in its timeslot, and placed in the bottom ten for the week (56th out of 65 shows).http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive- BC/BC-1985/BC-1985-12-30.pdf Home media releases The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus was released on VHS tape on September 26, 2000 by Warner Home Video.

Challenges in developing a vaccine include adeptness of CMV in evading the immune system and limited animal models. As of 2018 no such vaccine exists, although a number of vaccine candidates are under investigation. They include recombinant protein, live attenuated, DNA and other vaccines. As a member of the TORCH complex, cytomegalovirus can cause congenital infection, which can lead to neurological problems, vision and hearing loss. Infection/re- activation of CMV in immuno-compromised persons, including organ transplantation recipients, causes significant mortality and morbidity. Additionally, CMV has strong associations with plaques found in atherosclerosis progression. Because of all these, there has been considerable effort made towards the development of a vaccine, with particular emphasis on protection of pregnant women. Since vaccination of the immunocompromised persons introduces additional challenges, members of this population are less likely to be candidates for such a vaccine. Additionally, there are additional health risks for individuals who are already not infected with CMV. For instance, CMV infection is strongly associated with development of Alzheimer's Disease. Development of such a vaccine has been emphasized as a priority by the National Vaccine Program Office in the United States. Recombinant gB subunit vaccine A phase 2 study of a recombinant gB subunit CMV-vaccine published in 2009 indicated an efficacy of 50% in seronegative women of childbearing age—thus the protection provided was limited and a number of subjects contracted CMV infection despite the vaccination. In one case congenital CMV was encountered. Another phase 2 study of the same vaccine was done in patients awaiting kidney transplantation. The vaccine significantly boosted the antibody levels and reduced the duration of post-transplantation viremia. Further research In 2013, Astellas Pharma has started on individuals who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant a Phase III trial with its CMV deoxyribonucleic acid DNA cytomegalovirus vaccine ASP0113. In 2015, Astellas Pharma has commenced on healthy volunteers a Phase I trial with its cytomegalovirus vaccine ASP0113. In 2016, VBI Vaccines commenced a Phase I preventative cytomegalovirus vaccine study (VBI-1501). Other cytomegalovirus vaccines candidates are the CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine and the CMVpp65-A*0201 peptide vaccine. Both vaccine candidates are sponsored by the City of Hope National Medical Center. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 2 trial stage. In March 2019, Helocyte and City of Hope National Medical Center announced positive phase two results for Triplex. They are working on finding funding for Phase III research and then FDA approval.

Their music is noteworthy for their live shows, four-part harmonies, lyrical content, and diverse sound. History Velure was co-founded by Rich Turbo and longtime friend and musical partner Ben Holst, originally of Six Shades Blue in Athens, Georgia, in 1999. The group began its early career as a band called The Avenues. After transferring to UGA at the beginning of his junior year, Holst met keyboardist Sean McCullough, who had been trained in piano at a young age. The two formed The Avenues, a \\"jam band,\\". The Avenues headlined popular venues such as the Georgia Theatre and the 40 Watt Club. Holst began moonlighting with Athens band Six Shades Blue. While maintaining his relationship with McCullough, it was during this time that he became friends with Darren Stanley, drummer of Squat, and bassist Franher Joseph, both of the classic blues band Delta Moon. The Avenues, now consisting of Holst, McCullough, Stanley and Joseph, was introduced to Rich Turbo, son of pianist Rick C. Turbo of the 70's group Calliko Four, at a local poetry reading. Concerned with the previous direction of the sound and the limitations for a more performance-based show, Turbo approached Holst with the idea of sharpening the sound of the band, lending more towards a rock and pop genre, making it something more progressive and plausible so as to garner a larger and broader audience; Holst agreed. As Turbo started writing new material, the rest of the group worked to create a new sound and direction for the band. Jeff Schaefer, who was invited to play cello on the recording of the power ballad \\"Our Story,\\" assisted with this reinvention. The group completed the songs necessary to create a demo album, and asked Schaefer to join them full-time, as rock cellist and rhythm guitarist. Velure finished their four- song LP recording at Elixir Recordings and got started on a full-length debut album. They toured at various venues in Athens, as well as at Georgia Theatre, the 40 Watt Club, and AMF.

It lies at the top of the Sirhowy Valley, near to Brecon Beacons National Park. It is three miles northwest of Tredegar.  Etymology  The village name may derive from the terms 'tref' and 'mil' signifying the 'farm of the lesser celandine', a plant which might be expected to grow in the stream which flows through the place, the Nant Trefil.Owen, H.W. & Morgan, R. 2007 'Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales' Gomer Press, Ceredigion  Geography  The village is sited in the bottom of a broad valley which cuts through the moorlands between the Heads of the Valleys Road and the Dyffryn Crawnon valley to the north. At above sea level, the Ordnance Survey recognise Trefil as the highest village in Wales. Trefil is served by a single cul-de-sac road which leaves the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road 1.5 miles to the south.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL13 'Brecon Beacons National Park: eastern area' The boundary of the Brecon Beacons National Park lies one mile to the north of the village. It is described by some as Wales' highest village. Trefil is perhaps best known for its limestone quarries – a major one immediately north of the village is operational whilst Cwar yr Ystrad, Cwar yr Hendre and Cwar Blaen- dyffryn to the west and northwest are no longer operational. The Trefil Tramroad and the Sirhowy Tramroad formerly linked the quarries with the heavily industrialised areas to the south, providing limestone for the furnaces. The former Brinore Tramroad connected the quarries at Trefil with the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal at Talybont in the Usk Valley to the north. Open moorland rises to east and west of the village, the slopes to the west being known as Trefil Ddu and those to the east as Trefil Las. The moorland of Mynydd Llangynidr to the east undulates considerably and contains a number of caves beneath its surface. Most famous amongst these is Chartist's Cave one mile to the northeast of the village.  Nature  Trefil Quarries and Trefil Ddu are noted birdwatching sites; this area is the last remaining site in Gwent where ring ouzel occurs regularly, and other species present include raven, wheatear, stonechat, whinchat, snipe and red grouse.Venables, W. A. et al (2008) The Birds of Gwent , page 21 Arts and entertainment The BBC TV series Merlin filmed many episodes at Trefil quarry and the feature film Wrath of the Titans was filmed there in June 2011.  Sports  The village is the site of Trefile Rugby Welfare Club who play in WRU Division 3C East. Of particular note is the derby between Trefil and Tredegar which is traditionally a strongly contested affair.  Transport  The nearby town of Nantybwch is a 44 minute walk () from the village and is the location of bus services: * 97 (Ebbw Vale-Peacehaven) * 20 (Tredegar to Rhymney) Rhymney railway station is 60 minutes from the village by bus from Nantybwch. Nantybwch is the historic site of the now closed Nantybwch railway station.  Politics  The village is represented under the ward of Sirhowy and its councillors are Brian Thomas (Ind, Sirhowy), Malcolm Cross (Lab, Sirhowy), and Tommy Smith (Lab, Sirhowy). The area is represented in the Senedd by Alun Davies (Labour) and the Member of Parliament is Nick Smith (Labour).

The virus establishes latent infection and causes infectious mononucleosis. It is a dual-tropic virus, causing infection of both B cells and epithelial cells. One challenge is that the Epstein–Barr virus expresses very different proteins during its lytic and its latent phases. Several clinical trials for a vaccine were conducted in 2006–2008. The viral proteins Gp350/220 are a primary target, but this would only block infection of B cells, not epithelial cells. A vaccine called MVA-EL has been also proposed as a target for EBV-positive cancers, but this would only be effective in combating EBV-related cancers, not the EBV infection itself. VLP (virus-like particles)-based EBV vaccines are also the subject of intensive research. In April 2018, the first human antibody that blocks Epstein-Barr Virus was discovered, called AMMO1. It blocks glycoproteins gH and gL. This discovery defines new sites of vulnerability on Epstein-Barr Virus, and neutralizes the dual-tropic infection (stopping both infection of B cells and epithelial cells). It is the most promising discovery to date, as it is the first that may be able to block both B cell infection and epithelial infection.

She is best known for her advocacy of individualist feminism and for her role in the development of the modern American libertarian movement. Early life Taylor was born in Manhattan to prominent parents. Her father was composer, radio personality, and musical journalist Deems Taylor. Her mother was actress, playwright, and poet Mary Kennedy. She grew up in New York, in suburban Connecticut, and, after her parents separated when she was six years old, around the world. Her father's biographer, James Pegolotti, writes that \\"[b]y 1942, owing to a peregrinating mother, Joan had attended eight schools, in such far-flung spots as Peking, Paris, and Ellsworth, Maine, as well as New York.\\"James A. Pegolotti, Deems Taylor: A Biography (Boston: Northeastern University Press,2003), p. 280. After graduating from St. Timothy's School, Taylor returned to New York to study playwrighting at Barnard College. There she met Donald A. Cook, a psychology undergraduate at nearby Columbia University. After their marriage in 1948, Taylor went to work as an actress on stage, radio, and television (with the usual assortment of accompanying dead- end day jobs). Much of her spare time she devoted to auditing graduate courses in psychology at Columbia, where Cook was now pursuing a Ph.D., and to dabbling in the ideas of G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky.Pegolotti, Deems Taylor: A Biography, p. 309. In the early 1950s, the Cooks hosted a series of legendary parties at their ground-floor apartment on 112th Street, near the Barnard and Columbia campuses. Joyce Johnson, in her memoir Minor Characters, recalls the place as \\"like an apartment at the bottom of a well – midnight even on a sunny day. The door was never locked. You never knew whom you’d find there. Psychologists, Dixieland jazz musicians, poets, runaway girls, a madman named Carl Solomon whom an old Columbia classmate of [Donald’s], Allen Ginsberg, had met in a psychiatric ward.\\"Joyce Johnson, Minor Characters (Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1983), p. 59. In Johnson's account, Donald Cook, graduate student and psychology instructor, is thinly disguised as \\"Alex Greer,\\" graduate student and philosophy instructor. Nor were Solomon and Allen Ginsberg the only Beat Generation luminaries to attend these gatherings. There were also William S. Burroughs, Lucien Carr, Gregory Corso, and Jack Kerouac. Career In the mid-1950s, Taylor abandoned acting and went into publishing, taking a job at Alfred A. Knopf and Company. It was in 1957, James Pegolotti reports, when, \\"[a]s a publicity assistant at Knopf, Joan read an advance copy of [Ayn] Rand's Atlas Shrugged and found the book fascinating. She wrote a letter of appreciation to the author, who responded by inviting her to lunch. The two women established a friendship, partly because of Joan's deep interest in... 'Objectivism.' For Taylor, Rand blended literary aptitude and economic philosophy into an attractive package.\\"Pegolotti, Deems Taylor: A Biography, pp. 317–18. Taylor began writing about politics from her new Objectivist perspective and soon founded and edited an independent monthly political magazine, Persuasion (1964–1968), the first political magazine ever personally endorsed and recommended by Ayn Rand. In the December 1965 issue of The Objectivist Newsletter, Rand wrote that Persuasion \\"does a remarkable educational job in tying current political events to wider principles, evaluating specific events in a rational frame-of-reference, and maintaining a high degree of consistency. It is of particular interest and value to all those who are eager to fight on the level of practical politics, but flounder hopelessly for lack of proper material.\\"Ayn Rand, \\"A Recommendation.\\" The Objectivist Newsletter, Vol. 4 No. 12, December 1965, p. 8. Taylor's first book, When to See a Psychologist, written with clinical psychologist Lee M. Shulman, appeared in 1968. In the early 1970s, she worked as a co-therapist with various clinicians at both the Stockbridge, Massachusetts Free Clinic and the Austen Riggs Center. She began studying law in a Manhattan attorney's office and worked her way up to paralegal status. She also began working on behalf of feminist causes, which had gradually attracted her interest since the early 1960s when she read The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. During the Vietnam War, Joan was part of a group of Objectivists that put together a conference in Washington, DC, in an effort to end the military draft. \\"It was very successful,\\" she recalled. \\"We got a couple of hundred people at the conference. [One of the conference speakers,] Martin Anderson, decided that he would like to work on the presidential campaign and he went to see Nixon and he said, 'I'm down here speaking on the economics of the draft and I thought maybe I could persuade you to make [elimination of the draft] one of your issues.' Nixon, who had been raised a Quaker, said yes, he'd be interested. And he hired Marty to be one of his aides. He went from being an aide in the campaign, to being an aide in the White House, to being the person who was the liaison with the commission that was supposed to decide what should be done with the Army. He got them all to decide unanimously for abolishing the draft.\\"https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/4028-joan-kennedy- taylor-remembered In the mid-1970s, she joined the Libertarian Party and embarked on several years of political activism under its auspices. She helped to write the national party platform in the late 1970s, advised the party's Ed Clark for President campaign of 1980 on feminist issues, and indefatigably promoted the ERA and abortion rights to a party membership that was not particularly receptive to feminist concerns. In 1977, at the invitation of its editor, Roy A. Childs, Jr., Taylor joined the staff of the monthly magazine Libertarian Review, where she began writing regularly on feminist and other topics. Two years later, she became a regular biweekly commentator on the nationally syndicated daily radio program, Byline, which was underwritten by the libertarian Cato Institute. Soon she was writing for Reason magazine and Inquiry Magazine, as well as the Libertarian Review. In the 1980s, she even spent a brief time as an editor of The Freeman, then as now the oldest libertarian magazine on the market. As director of the book publishing program of the Manhattan Institute, 1981–1985, Taylor \\"discovered\\" a then virtually unknown political scientist named Charles Murray and commissioned him to write the book that became Losing Ground (1984), editing his manuscript as it was written, arranging for its publication by Basic Books, and masterminding the publicity campaign that made it not only a bestseller, but, according to at least one source, one of the seventeen most influential works of sociology ever published.Dan Clawson, ed., Required Reading: Sociology's Most Influential Books (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1998). The last two decades of Taylor's life were devoted almost entirely to her feminist concerns. From 1989 to 2003 she served as national coordinator of the Association of Libertarian Feminists (and as editor of its newsletter), and throughout the 1990s she also served as vice president and as a member of the board of directors of Feminists for Free Expression, a group of which she had been a founding member. She taught courses at the New School (then still the New School for Social Research) – one on \\"Different Voices: Feminism at the Crossroads\\" and another on \\"Women and the Law.\\" As a writer on feminist topics, she contributed to magazines and books, she lectured all over the country, and she published two books of her own, Reclaiming the Mainstream: Individualist Feminism Rediscovered (Prometheus, 1992) and What to Do When You Don't Want to Call the Cops: A Non-Adversarial Approach to Sexual Harassment (New York University Press, 1999). Early in 2002, Taylor was diagnosed with bladder cancer. Late in 2005 she died from the effects of the cancer and related kidney failure.

Football career Mackie was born in Motherwell and, after playing in Scotland with Motherwell F.C. and junior club Blantyre Celtic, moved to the south coast of England to join Portsmouth in May 1920. =Portsmouth= Portsmouth became one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division for the 1920–21 season and Mackie was one of new manager, John McCartney's first signings. McCartney had boldly predicted that promotion to the Second Division would be secured in three years. Mackie soon became a regular in Portsmouth's team, taking over the inside-right position from Frank Stringfellow. In the 1922–23 season, Mackie was a virtual ever-present missing only three games and his ten league goals made him Portsmouth's top-scorer for the season, as the club finished seventh in the table. For the next season, Mackie was part of a settled forward line containing Willie Haines up front with Mackie and Angus Meikle on the right and David Watson and William Beedie on the left. Portsmouth finished the season as champions of the Football League Third Division South with a four- point advantage over Plymouth Argyle. In Portsmouth's first season in the Second Division, Haines shared the goal-scoring with Willie Haines with both players scoring 17 goals as Pompey finished in a creditable fourth place in the table. Mackie continued to score regularly in the next two seasons with 19 goals in 1925–26 when Portsmouth finished in mid-table, and 12 in 1926–27 as Pompey gained promotion to the First Division as runners-up, squeezing out Manchester City on goal average, by a margin of just 0.006. Mackie's goal tally included a pair scored in a 9–1 victory over Notts County on 9 April 1927 – this remains Portsmouth's record margin of victory. For Portsmouth's first season in the top flight, Haines was out of favour with new manager Jack Tinn who was building a team for the future, with Welsh international Fred Cook taking over the position of inside-right. In March 1928, Mackie moved up the Solent to join local rivals Southampton for a fee of £1000. In his eight seasons at Fratton Park, Mackie scored 82 goals from 263 appearances in all competitions. =Southampton= At Southampton, Mackie was seen as the replacement for Bill Rawlings who had just moved to join Manchester United. Mackie made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in a 2–1 defeat at South Shields on 17 March 1928, with his home debut coming a week later, when he scored a hat- trick in a 6–1 victory over Barnsley. By the end of the season, he had scored six goals from seven appearances, before he was injured bringing his season to a premature end. For the 1928–29 season, Mackie was re-united with his former strike partner, Willie Haines and the pair scored 26 goals between as the Saints finished fourth in the Second Division table. Mackie continued to create chances for Haines and his fellow forward, Dick Rowley, but injury kept him out of the team for long periods in the first half of next season and it was not until March 1930 that he had a sustained run of games. Mackie had been sent off in the opening match of the season, a 3–1 defeat away to Barnsley and he was the first Saints player to be dismissed since Jimmy Moore in December 1920. A similar pattern followed in 1930–31, only appearing in the opening game (a 5–0 defeat at Preston), until, after several players had been tried at inside-right, including Laurie Cumming and Bill Fraser, he was recalled to the side in January 1931. On 14 March 1931, he scored his 100th league goal against Bristol City at The Dell. At the end of the season he retired after making 84 appearances for the Saints, scoring 24 goals. Later life After his retirement from football, he became the licensee of the Regents Park Hotel in Shirley, remaining a publican for 24 years. He later settled in Bognor Regis, where he died in 1959, a few days after his 65th birthday.

The central tenet of Our World 2.0 is that humanity can use its collective knowledge, technology, and design to facilitate creativity, innovation, and collaboration among people in order to respond to these challenges. In 2013, the Our World 2.0 online magazine was completely redesigned and the range of topics covered was expanded to encompass all areas of the United Nation's work. At that time, the 2.0 tag was dropped from the magazine. The story behind the development of the Our World 2.0 magazine was covered in a book chapter published in 2013 by Brendan F.D. Barrett, Mark Notoras and Carol Smith. All were involved as editors for the magazine. One innovative component of the Our World 2.0 magazine was the introduction of video briefs - short 5-6 minute videos designed to introduce complex scientific issues (mainly in the field) to policy-makers and the general public. They tend to be short, character-driven stories about people and organisations that are tackling complex social development and environmental issues in new, innovative ways.

This model was defined starting from combinatorial maps in order to represent non-orientable and open subdivisions, which is not possible with combinatorial maps. The main advantage of generalized map is the homogeneity of one-to-one mappings in any dimensions, which simplifies definitions and algorithms comparing to combinatorial maps. For this reason, generalized maps are sometimes used instead of combinatorial maps, even to represent orientable closed partitions. Like combinatorial maps, generalized maps are used as efficient data structure in image representation and processing, in geometrical modeling, they are related to simplicial set and to combinatorial topology, and this is a boundary representation model (B-rep or BREP), i.e. it represents object by its boundaries.

Maryland hired Tatum to replace Clark Shaughnessy after the 1946 season. Tatum had created both success and controversy during his one season as head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football team. During his nine-year tenure, Tatum became one of the most successful head football coaches in Maryland history, and the Terrapins compiled two national championships, three conference championships, and five bowl game appearances. His teams compiled a 73–15–4 record without a single losing season, and as of the end of 2016, he has the highest winning percentage of any Maryland football coach who coached at least seven games. In 1954, the University of Maryland appointed a new president, Dr. Wilson Elkins, who chose to de-emphasize football. Following the 1955 season, Tatum took a pay cut to coach at his alma mater, North Carolina, and he died four years later. During Tatum's tenure, several Maryland players were awarded prestigious individual honors. Two Maryland quarterbacks were runners-up for the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded to college football's most outstanding player. In 1952, Jack Scarbath was a first runner-up to Oklahoma running back Billy Vessels.1952 – 18th Award , Heisman.com, retrieved December 10, 2008.

Seven Maryland players received first-team All-American honors: Bernie Faloney, Stan Jones, Dick Modzelewski, Bob Pellegrini, Mike Sandusky, Jack Scarbath, and Bob Ward (twice honored). Seven Maryland players received second-team All-American honors: Tom Cosgrove, Chet Hanulak, Ray Krouse, Dick Modzelewski, Ed Modzelewski, Ed Vereb, and Bill Walker (twice honored).

Tatum before Maryland Jim Tatum was born in McColl, South Carolina on July 22, 1913. He played football as a left tackle like four of his older brothers. Tatum attended the University of North Carolina where he played for Carl Snavely's Tar Heels and earned All-American honors during his senior year in . The following season, he became Snavely's assistant coach and followed him to Cornell in 1936. Tatum returned to North Carolina in 1940 as an assistant coach under Bear Wolf. In 1942, Tatum was promoted into the head coaching job himself and compiled a 5–2–2 record. The next year, during the Second World War, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served as an assistant coach for the Iowa Pre-Flight School football team under Don Faurot, the inventor of the split-T. Future Oklahoma coach Bud Wilkinson worked as an assistant coach alongside Tatum. In 1946, with the recommendation of Oklahoma athletic director Jap Haskell, Tatum was hired as the Sooners' head coach and brought Wilkinson as an assistant. Tatum replaced Dewey Luster, who resigned due to ill health.Harold Keith, Sooner Sports (PDF), Sooner Magazine, p. 6, January 1946, retrieved December 17, 2008. Luster had struggled in the position as the Second World War put a continuous and heavy drain on athletes at the University of Oklahoma.Harold Keith, Sooner Sports (PDF), Sooner Magazine, p. 15, July 1942, retrieved December 17, 2008. The final game before Luster's resignation was a 0–47 loss at the hands of Oklahoma A&M;, which rounded out Oklahoma's 1945 season with a 5–5 record. In Tatum's one season at Oklahoma, he led the Sooners to an 8–3 finish and a share of the Big Six Conference championship.All-Time Results (PDF), Program History, 2008 Oklahoma Football Guide, p. 194, University of Oklahoma Sooners Athletics, 2008, retrieved December 17, 2008. Tatum and his staff also recruited nine players who became All-Americans: Plato Andros, Buddy Burris, Jack Mitchell, Jim Owens, John Rapacz, Darrell Royal, George Thomas, Wade Walker, and Stan West. In addition to his team's success on the gridiron, Tatum caused controversy. Buddy Burris, the first three-time All-American at Oklahoma, said, \\"Jim Tatum was a con-man, a dictator, a tyrant, and one hell of a football coach.\\" Tatum greatly surpassed his allocated budget and linked players with sponsors who sometimes paid or bought clothes for their sponsored players. After a 34–13 Gator Bowl victory over N.C. State, University of Oklahoma president George Cross discovered that Tatum had paid the fifty Sooners players $120 each ($, adjusted for inflation). Cross had explicitly warned Tatum not to do so, as it was a violation of conference rules. With further investigation, it was discovered that $60,000 ($ in inflation-adjusted terms) was unaccounted for in the athletic department budget, which resulted in the relief of athletic director Jap Haskell. Meanwhile, Tatum resigned to take the head coaching job at Maryland with a $12,000 salary, one-third more than he made at Oklahoma, ($, adjusted for inflation). Oklahoma filled the open coaching job with Tatum's former assistant, Bud Wilkinson.Gary King, The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum , Sooner Magazine, University of Oklahoma Foundation, Inc., Spring 2008, retrieved December 17, 2008. The 1947 season Lu Gambino, who had limited playing time under Shaughnessy, proved a star during the 1947 season. In Tatum's initial season at Maryland, his results were similar to those at Oklahoma. After compiling a 3–6 record the year prior, the Terrapins improved to 7–2–2 under Tatum. Whereas his predecessor Clark Shaughnessy had pioneered the T-formation, Tatum installed the split-T offense that his former colleague Don Farout had invented. The team's two losses came at the hands of two ranked period powerhouses, Duke and North Carolina.Year-by-Year Results (PDF), 2008 Maryland Football Media Guide, University of Maryland, 2008.

Maryland responded with an 80-yard drive for another score by Gambino. Georgia turned the ball over with a fumble on its own 40-yard line and Maryland capitalized with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Gambino.

At Georgia, Maryland lost its season-opener, 7–27. Tatum said, \\"We weren't ready for Georgia in a game as early as September 23 ... We weren't in shape and the [] heat killed us.\\" The loss, however, did not affect Maryland's poll ranking as the situation surrounding the game was generally understood.Terrapin, University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 276. In Week 2, the Terrapins played the inaugural game at the newly completed Byrd Stadium. It was the first game against the Naval Academy in 16 years. The series had been canceled in 1934 after Maryland accused Navy of an illegal game-winning play. In 1950, Maryland agreed to fill a vacancy in the Navy schedule left open by a Georgetown cancellation.Rick Snider, Ill will lingers at Navy, Maryland; Rivalry to restart in Crab Bowl, The Washington Times, p. 1, August 29, 2005.

After upsetting second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland climbed to an AP Poll ranking of eighth in the nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five- yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid.Terrapin, University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1951, p. 284. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll for the remainder of the year.Maryland 1950 AP Football Rankings , AP Poll Archive, retrieved January 15, 2009. Bob Ward was named a first-team All-American. Ward and Elmer Wingate were named All-Southern Conference. The 1951 season Quarterback Jack Scarbath helped engineer Maryland's undefeated 1951 season. Over the course of the season, Maryland outscored its opponents 381–74, accumulated three shutout wins, and held seven opponents to 7 points or less. It was Maryland's first 10-win season and remains the team's only perfect undefeated season in the modern era.This usage of \\"modern era\\" is used to differentiate from Maryland's only other perfect season in 1893. Maryland entered the season at number-16 on the AP and Coaches' polls, and remained ranked for the duration. A 40-point trouncing of conference foe George Washington in the season-opener propelled the Terrapins to a number-nine ranking in both polls. Other wins included games against Southeastern Conference powerhouses: a romp over Georgia and a shutout against LSU. Before the Georgia game, Tatum showed his team that Georgia had charged only $5 for tickets, instead of the usual $7.50 ($ instead of $, adjusted for inflation). Tatum said, \\"They don't think very much of you, do they?\\" The Terrapins finished the regular season with a 9–0 record and the Southern Conference championship. They achieved a final ranking as the number- three team in the nation.At the time, both the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll published their final rankings, and declared the national champions, before the postseason bowl games. They secured a berth in the Sugar Bowl to face the number-one team in the nation, undefeated Tennessee led by head coach \\"General\\" Robert Neyland.Maryland 1951 AP Football Rankings , AP Poll Archive, retrieved January 15, 2009. =1952 Sugar Bowl= The Washington Post called the 1952 Sugar Bowl the second \\"game of the century\\", with the first having been between the undefeated Army and Notre Dame teams in 1946. Maryland was viewed as an underdog against Tennessee, which included five All-Americans on its roster.Vic Gold, The Greatest Game, Washingtonian magazine, January 1, 2002. The Volunteers were led by Heisman runner-up quarterback Hank Lauricella,1951 - 17th Award , Heisman.com, retrieved January 15, 2009. and Neyland's offensive linemen were described as not large but \\"squatty\\" and \\"bruiser[s], not flashy, but slightly murderous.\\" Neyland considered the split-T offense used by Tatum gimmicky and relied on the more traditional single-wing formation. For the game, Tatum himself abandoned the split-T in favor of a smashmouth strategy, which he hoped would catch Tennessee off- guard. Neyland's strategy focused heavily on punting the ball to pin the opponent in their own territory with a goal of creating turnovers, and Tatum likewise adopted it. The game started with both teams exchanging several punts in the first quarter. Maryland gained good field position after Lauricella kicked a short punt. Running backs Ed Modzelewski and Ed Fullerton then led an 11-play, 56-yard rushing drive for a touchdown. On the kickoff, Bob Ward hit Lauricella and forced a fumble that Maryland recovered on Tennessee's 13-yard line. After four plays, Jack Scarbath pitched to Fullerton who then threw a six-yard forward pass to Bob Shemonski in the end zone and expanded the Maryland lead to 14–0. Scarbath then engineered a 48-yard drive and ran it in himself for the Terrapins' third touchdown within seven minutes.Text from Page 178, Terrapin, University of Maryland Yearbook, 1952, p. 178. Late in the second quarter, Tennessee back Bert Rechichar caught a four-yard pass for a touchdown, but the extra point was no good. At the end of the first half, Maryland had stunned Tennessee by gaining a 21–6 lead.All-Time Postseason Results (PDF), 2001 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide, p. 155, 2001, retrieved January 25, 2009. In the fourth quarter, Fullerton intercepted a pass and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown. In the final minutes, Tennessee's goal-line quarterback Herky Payne ran it in from the one-yard line. Maryland won the game with a final result of 28–13. =Effects= Maryland players celebrate their victory over No. 1 Tennessee. With the final polls already closed before the bowl season, Tennessee retained possession of the national championship. In following years, however, several selectors have named Maryland as the retroactive 1951 national champions: Jeff Sagarin, the College Football Researchers Association, DeVold System, Dunkel System, and National Championship Foundation.2007 NCAA Division I Football Records Book (PDF), National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2007, retrieved January 15, 2009. =Awards= Jim Tatum was named the Southern Conference Coach of the Year.

The 1952 season Maryland routed No. 20 Navy, 38-7, in 1952. Maryland was sanctioned for violating a Southern Conference rule, passed halfway through the 1951 season, that banned postseason play. The punishment, for participating in the Sugar Bowl, disallowed the Terrapins from playing any conference games during the 1952 season.David Ungrady, Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, p. 77–78, Sports Publishing LLC, 2003, . This compelled Maryland to schedule all but three games on the road. The AP preseason poll ranked Maryland second in the nation. The Terrapins recorded a 37-point shutout of 19th-ranked Georgia and defeated 20th-ranked Navy, 38–7. Maryland finished the season with a No. 13 final ranking. Their loss at Mississippi ended a 22-game winning streak for the Terrapins. Tatum blamed the Terrapins' late season slide to injuries suffered by star quarterback Scarbath and weariness from the grueling road schedule. =Effects= After the season, disaffection within the Southern Conference prompted seven former members, including Maryland, to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was due in part to the ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.K. Adam Powell and Woody Durham, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, p. xvi, Scarecrow Press, , 2004. Tatum considered resigning in order to enter business. University president Byrd, a staunch patron of football at the school, was preparing to campaign for governor, and Tatum feared his successor would significantly reduce the number of athletic scholarships available. He and Byrd, however, had also disagreed over the decision to participate in bowl games in violation of conference rules. Tatum was opposed to it, as it greatly increased the difficulty of scheduling and had caused the reduction in number of home games.Coach Jim Tatum Through With Maryland Terrapins, Rome News-Tribune, December 4, 1952. =Awards= In 1952, Maryland quarterback Jack Scarbath was runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded to college football's most outstanding player. Scarbath received 367 points, coming behind to Oklahoma running back Billy Vessels, who received 525 points. Scarbath also was named the Southern Conference Player of the Year. Dick Modzelewski was awarded the Outland Trophy and the Knute Rockne Award. Scarbath and Dick Modzelewski were also both named consensus first-team All-Americans. Tom Cosgrove was named a second-team All-American. Stan Jones and Scarbath were named All-Southern Conference.

The 1953 season During this season, Maryland outscored its opponents 298–38, accumulated six shutout wins, and allowed only one team, Georgia, to score more than 7 points. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967 and none has ever allowed fewer points in the regular season (31). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game).\\"ACC Year by Year\\" (PDF), 2007 ACC Football Media Guide, Atlantic Coast Conference, 2007, accessed January 14, 2008. At the end of the regular season, the three wire services, the Associated Press, International News Service, and United Press, each named Maryland as the national championship team.Maryland All National Championships , College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved March 15, 2009. Maryland entered the season ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll.Maryland 1953 AP Football Rankings , AP Poll Archive, retrieved 27 January 2009. In the season opener against Missouri, Chet Hanulak scored in the first two minutes of play on a 61-yard run. Maryland intercepted four passes while sacrificing three fumbles in the 20–7 win. Against Washington and Lee, Hanulak made an interception and then on Maryland's possession rushed for a 12-yard touchdown. Ron Waller dropped a Generals' punt at mid-field, but recovered and returned it for a touchdown. After halftime, Tatum fielded third- and fourth-string players before the final results of 52–0. At Clemson, quarterback Bernie Faloney returned the opening kick off 88 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Clemson quarterback Don King was sacked by several Maryland defenders and suffered a game-ending knee injury. With 45 seconds left in the half, Dick Nolan scored on a 90-yard punt return. In the second half, Faloney connected with Nolan for a 65-yard touchdown pass. Clemson finished the game with two pass completions and suffered its first shutout at home in 11 years, 20–0. Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced its first true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins took a quick 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six offensive plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski was taken out of the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season. At North Carolina, the undefeated Terrapins met the undefeated Tar Heels. Two 15-yard penalties against North Carolina set up a quarterback sneak by Faloney for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Bill Walker caught a pitch at the Maryland 35 and ran it 49 yards to the North Carolina 16-yard line. From there, Charlie Boxold scored another touchdown for the Terrapins. In the third quarter, Hanulak took a pitch and took it 34 yards into the end zone. The 26–0 win was the Maryland's first in Chapel Hill, North Carolina since 1924. Tatum later called it \\"the greatest win of any team I ever coached, including the [1952] Sugar Bowl [over national champion Tennessee].\\" At Miami, Hanulak scored first on a two-yard rush. Morgan recovered a Miami fumble and on the ensuing possession Faloney scored on an eight-yard rush. By halftime, Maryland led 27–0. Tatum disallowed any passes or trick plays in the second half, and the final result was 30–0. Maryland next traveled to South Carolina to face a team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a long drive with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted it away and the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed them back to the 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.K. Adam Powell and Woody Durham, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, p. 3, Scarecrow Press, , 2004. After defeating George Washington 27–6, the Terrapins went on to shut out two ranked teams: 11th-ranked Mississippi and 11th-ranked Alabama. Maryland secured a share of the ACC championship alongside Duke and a berth in the Orange Bowl as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation. Maryland finished the regular season 10–0 and were crowned the national champions. =1954 Orange Bowl= In Miami, first-ranked Maryland faced the team Tatum had coached prior to his arrival at College Park: fourth-ranked Oklahoma under former assistant Bud Wilkinson. The Sooners handed Maryland their only defeat, 0–7, but—as had happened in 1951 to the Terrapins' detriment—the final rankings were released before the bowls, and for the third time in four years, AP's national champion was defeated in their postseason game. However, unlike Tennessee, who retained their top-rank despite losing to Maryland in 1951, the Terrapins (10–1–0) did indeed finish with the best record, better than the Orange Bowl victor, Oklahoma (9–1–1).Year-by-Year Football Recap, Information Please Database, retrieved January 16, 2009.AP National Champions, University of Southern California Official Athletic Site, retrieved January 16, 2009. Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the same time, the Terps scored a record combined total of 298 points, a number not exceeded until 1967. =Awards= Like the year prior, in 1953, a Maryland quarterback, Bernie Faloney, was in contention for the Heisman Trophy. Faloney finished fourth in the running and received 258 points, behind Notre Dame's John Lattner (1,850), Minnesota's Paul Giel (1,794), and UCLA's Paul Cameron (444). Stan Jones was selected as a consensus first-team All-American. Bernie Faloney was also named a first-team All-American. Chet Hanulak was named a second-team All-American. Four Terrapins were named to the All-ACC first-team: John Bowersox, Bernie Faloney, Chester Hanulak, and Stan Jones. Three were named to the All-ACC second-team: Ralph Felton, Bob Morgan, and Bill Walker. The 1954 season On Thanksgiving Day, Tatum coached Maryland to a pummeling, 74–13, of his former boss Don Faurot's Missouri, and the Terrapins set an ACC record- high for scoring that stood for 27 years.K. Adam Powell and Woody Durham, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, p. 167, Scarecrow Press, , 2004. Maryland finished the season with a 7–2–1 record and was named the eighth-ranked team by AP. Bill Walker was selected by AP as a second-team All-American. Three Maryland players were named to the All-ACC first team: Dick Bielski, Bill Walker, and Ronnie Waller. Two were named to the All-ACC second team: John Irvine and Bob Pellegrini. The 1955 season In Tatum's final season in College Park, Maryland spent four weeks as the first-ranked team in the AP Poll and ten weeks ranked in the top three.Maryland 1955 AP Football Rankings , AP Poll Archive, retrieved January 16, 2009. No opponent managed more than 13 points during the regular season. Maryland again had the first-ranked rushing defense in the nation, allowing 83.9 yards per game. Frank Tamburello became the starting quarterback, and entered the season with significant game experience from the prior year as a reserve behind Charlie Boxold. Fullback Tom Selep missed the season due to a knee injury. The opener against Missouri was a much closer contest than the previous year's record-setting game. Ed Vereb rushed for a 14-yard touchdown and Tamburello passed for another, but only failed extra-point attempts by Missouri in the second half preserved victory, 13–12. In week two, Maryland met first-ranked UCLA for the second half of a home-and-home series in a game dubbed \\"The Best of the East vs. the Best of the West.\\"Traditions , University of Maryland, retrieved January 16, 2009. It was a rain-soaked defensive contest at Byrd Stadium, where Maryland held UCLA's rushing attack to −21 yards. UCLA quarterback Ronnie Knox completed 10 of 15 passes for 100 yards but also threw two interceptions. Late in the first quarter, Knox's passing brought the Bruins to the Maryland three-yard line. On the next play, UCLA advanced to the one-foot line before Bob Pellegrini tackled second-string fullback Doug Peters to force a fumble. Maryland made the only score when, in the third quarter, quarterback Frank Tamburello executed an option run and pitched to halfback Ed Vereb, who ran it 15 yards into the end zone.The Tough Terrapins Stop The Knoxes, Sports Illustrated, October 3, 1955.The Sanders Era Ends (UCLA 1955–1957) (PDF), The LA82 Foundation, retrieved January 17, 2009. With the victory, the Terrapins became the first-ranked team. The following week, Maryland beat 20th-ranked Baylor, 20–6, with Tamburello passing for two touchdowns.K. Adam Powell and Woody Durham, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, p. 13, Scarecrow Press, , 2004. Maryland then defeated Wake Forest, 28–7, and held them to nine rushing yards. Against North Carolina, they allowed 18 yards on the ground. Vereb scored three touchdowns and made an interception, but the Tar Heels scored under unusual circumstances when center Jim Jones stripped Tamburello and returned it 35 yards. The final result was 25–7. Syracuse scored the most points of any regular season opponent with touchdowns by Jim Brown and Don Althouse, but Maryland's offense scored a season high and won, 34–13. The Terrapins shutout a mediocre South Carolina, 27–0, and Louisiana State, 13–0, against whom they made four interceptions including one in the end zone by Phil Perlo. Clemson took the lead early with a Don King touchdown pass to Dalton Rivers and Joel Wells breaking away for another score soon after. Maryland's reserve quarterback, Lynn Beightol, threw to Ed Vereb for two touchdowns, and in the second half, Clemson was allowed only 22 yards. Maryland won, 25–12. Maryland posted a fourth shutout against , 19–0. Vereb scored two touchdowns, which tied Lu Gambino's single-season school record of 16. The Terrapins, with a perfect ACC record, were named conference co-champions alongside Duke for the second consecutive year. Maryland possessed a perfect regular season record and ranked third in the nation behind Michigan State (8–1). The Terps secured an Orange Bowl rematch against first-ranked Oklahoma and a chance to avenge their defeat in 1953. However, the Sooners beat them again, 20–6, and they finished the postseason with a 10–1 record. =Awards= Bob Pellegrini was named a consensus first-team All-American, the National Lineman of the Year, and the ACC Player of the Year.K.

Three were named to the All-ACC second-team: Russell Dennis, Frank Tamburello, and Bill Walker. Tatum's departure H. C. \\"Curley\\" Byrd served as Maryland president during most of Tatum's tenure. In 1954, Curley Byrd resigned as university president in order to enter state politics, and was replaced by Dr. Wilson Elkins, a Rhodes scholar and former Texas quarterback. Elkins worked to improve academic standards at the school, which had been criticized for overemphasizing football. One year during Tatum's tenure, the school awarded 93 football scholarships averaging $944 each ($ adjusted for inflation). The Diamondback student newspaper said that, while Tatum was at Maryland, it \\"was an era in which an inadequate stadium became ultra-adequate, and an inadequate library became more inadequate.\\" During his tenure at Maryland, Tatum became one of the most successful head football coaches in school history. In nine seasons, he led the Terrapins to two national championships, three conference championships, and five bowl game appearances. His teams compiled a 73–15–4 record without a single losing season. To date, he remains the winningest Maryland football coach of the modern era with a winning percentage of 0.819.Records (PDF), 2007 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide, University of Maryland, p. 55, retrieved January 14, 2009. After the 1955 season, Tatum took an 18% pay cut, from $18,500 to $15,000 (from $ to $ in inflation-adjusted terms), to return to North Carolina as head coach. There, The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper was displeased to see Tatum arrive and called him a \\"parasitic monster of open professionalism.\\"The Coach, Time, August 3, 1959. After a few years, however, he was accepted by the student body, the faculty, and alumni.Roy Terrell, Kickoff in Dixie, Sports Illustrated, September 29, 1958.

After continuing his career in England, Collins moved to the United States and continued working there as an artist and, for more than 20 years, as a professor of art at Seventh-day Adventist universities. Collins work primarily focused on evocative Biblical stories told in outdoor sculptures, which has been described as \\"24-hour, 365-days-a-year silent sermons.\\" Early life Collins was born in the village of Beddington, in northeast Surrey, England. He naturally took to art as a child as a way to spend his time and a means of communication: when it was difficult to explains something he'd seen in words, he was more successful communicating in images. At the age of 16, after attending public schools, Collins entered Wimbledon School of Art. While there he earned first prize in an England-wide competition. Having won a scholarship for the Royal College of Art, he studied sculpture. Collins developed a lifelong connection to the Adventist Church after having attended a meeting by Australian evangelist Thomas J. Bradley in Corydon, England. At a Seventh-day Adventist Church in Holloway, London, Collins met his future wife Jeanne Fuegi, and they were married in 1954. Career When Collins first began carving in stone he used limestone from Malta, which was in great supply during and after World War II as it had been used by supply ships as ballast when returning to England without cargo. His sculptures were exhibited at the Royal Society for the Arts and the Royal Academy,Appendix section about Alan Collins. City of London, Planning. p. 1.

In 1964 Collins was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and received the Society's Sir Otto Beit Medal for his stone carving of St. Martha of Bethany at Guildford Cathedral. In 1968 he moved to the United States and began career of over 20 years, teaching at Seventh-day Adventists universities, including Atlantic Union College (1968–1971) in Massachusetts, Andrews University (1971–1978) in Michigan and La Sierra University (1978–1989) in California. As a result of his years of work teaching at Adventist universities, he developed a \\"signature style\\" that is attributed to Adventist college works. After retiring from teaching, Collins worked in Phoenix, Oregon on his own works made in many mediums: bronze, wood, clay, wood, concrete and stone. He created many works for the Adventist Church, and also conducted lectures and showed his work at Adventist colleges. He moved back to England in 2013, and lived in Bridport, Dorset until his death. Works Aside from Collins' work at Guildford Cathedral, he executed other works in England before moving to the United States. Most notably, he designed and carved the John F. Kennedy Memorial at Runnymede. In the United States he created sculptures largely for religious organisations, commissions from hospitals and private individuals. He never used models for his sculptures, they were all created using his own imagination. He was noted for being very knowledgeable of human anatomy and he always taught human anatomy to his sculpture students. This information came from his second wife Aliki Collins. =Guildford Cathedral= Collins' most extensive work was created for the exterior of Guildford Cathedral, including: * The Hand of God, visible at the approach to the cathedral.

It connects many towns in the Coastal Plain region. Route description History NC 43 was established around 1928 as a new primary routing between US 17-1/NC 40, in Rocky Mount, and NC 58, in Liberia. In 1931, NC 43 was extended southeast on new primary routing, through Pinetops, to Greenville; then replaced NC 301 to US 17/NC 30, in Vanceboro. Around 1936, NC 43 was rerouted onto new roadway at Essex, avoiding Hollister. In 1958, NC 43 was rerouted in the downtown Greenville area, leaving behind: Charles Avenue, 10th Street, Albemarle Street and 5th Street. In 1987, NC 43 was extended south of Vanceboro along US 17 Business and US 17 to Weyerhaeuser Road. Traveling along Weyerhaeuser Road, it connects and overlap with NC 55 going into New Bern; then with US 70 Business and southward to US 70 and US 17\\\\. The resulting new routing made a western rural bypass of New Bern. In 1998, NC 43 was rerouted onto new connector in downtown Rocky Mount. In 2001, NC 43 was rerouted onto northern bypass route around Rocky Mount, leaving behind NC 43 Bus. In 2009, NC 43 was rerouted onto new road between NC 55 and US 17/US 70, eliminating its routing through New Bern. Major intersections Special routes =Rocky Mount business loop= North Carolina Highway 43 Business (NC 43 Bus) was established in 2001, when NC 43 was rerouted to bypass north of downtown Rocky Mount.

No effective vaccine for the disease exists yet. Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in rural agricultural and peri-urban areas of developing countries, and approximately 10% suffer severe health complications from the infection. While chemotherepeutic drugs, such as praziquantel, oxamniquine and metrifonate both no longer on the market, are currently considered safe and effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis, reinfection occurs frequently following drug treatment, thus a vaccine is sought to provide long-term treatment. Additionally, experimental vaccination efforts have been successful in animal models of schistosomiasis. Paramyosin has been proposed as a vaccine candidate. At present Sm-p80 (calpain) is the sole schistosome vaccine candidate that has been tested for its prophylactic and antifecundity efficacy in different vaccine formulations and approaches (e.g., DNA alone, recombinant protein and prime boost) in two very different experimental animal models (mouse and baboon) of infection and disease. Sm-p80-based vaccine formulation(s) have four effects: Reduction in adult worm numbers; Reduction in egg production (complete elimination of egg induced pathology both in baboons and mice); Protection against acute schistosomiasis; Therapeutic effect on adult worms. This vaccine is now ready for human clinical trials. Another target is Sm14. Research support Schistosomiasis has been considered a \\"neglected disease\\" that disproportionately affects poorer localities and has received little attention from pharmaceutical companies.

It was located on Mississippi's Horn Island and opened in 1943. When the war ended, the facility was closed. Ocean Springs (center right) History Horn Island Chemical Warfare Service Quarantine Station was acquired in March 1943 by the U.S. Army for use as a biological weapons testing site.Harris, Sheldon H. Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare 1932-45 and the American Cover-Up, (Google Books), Routledge, 1994, pp. 155-56, (). The site was located on Horn Island, about south of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and opened on October 29, 1943. The siteWhitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 73-74, (). on Horn Island was managed and built by the Chemical Warfare Service's (CWS) Special Projects Division (SPD).Lindler, Luther E. et al. Biological Weapons Defense: Infectious Diseases and Counterbioterrorism, (Google Books), Humana Press, 2005, p. 156, (). By May 1944 the U.S. bio- weapons program employed 1,500 people between its Horn Island facility and the facilities at Camp Detrick. The work at Horn Island, like all of the work done at SPD facilities during World War II was highly classified and precautions were taken to ensure the work remained secret; during the Army's occupation of Horn Island the public was barred from the island. Soon after construction at the facility was complete it was found that the area was unsuitable for large- scale testing of biological agents. At the time, shipping traffic on the Mississippi River, near the island, was rising. It was determined that bio- weapons trials in close proximity to human population was undesirable and testing on the island was limited. Shortly before the end of World War II, on August 11, 1945, an order from the CWS declared that the Special Projects Division was to cease its activities.Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism, (Google Books), Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 64-72, (). The facility at Horn Island was closed in 1946. Mission and facilities Horn Island was acquired for the sole purpose of becoming a biological weapons test site for the U.S. military. The site was established as one of several designed to assist the newly formed U.S. biological weapons program at Camp Detrick. Horn Island Testing Station was initially established to focus its studies on insects as biological weapons. When conceived and constructed the testing station at Horn Island was meant to be the primary bio-weapons field testing site for the United States.Regis, Ed. The Biology of Doom: The History of America's Secret Germ Warfare Project, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2000, pp. 63-77, (). The U.S. Army built facilities on the island for these purposes which included several buildings, roads, and a narrow gauge railroad. The Army also constructed an incinerator with a tall brick chimney on the island. After the Army abandoned the site, a hurricane destroyed most of the structures,Falls, Sr., Robert P. Exploring Gulf Islands National Seashore, (Google Books), Globe Pequot, 2001, p. 122, (). including the incinerator and chimney.McGinnis, Helen. Hiking Mississippi: A Guide to Trails and Natural Areas, (Google Books), University Press of Mississippi , 1995, pp. 101-02, (). The foundations of some of the military buildings are still visible on the island, which is now part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Additionally, the remnants of the incinerator chimney were still visible into at least the 1980s. Research and testing Because of its proximity to human populations only two lethal agents, both toxins, were ever tested on the island, botulin and ricin. The U.S. Navy used the site during the war to study mosquitoes and flies that were native to the Pacific Islands. In addition, an anthrax simulant, Bacillus globigii was used in aerosol dispersion tests at the station. Testing at Horn Island with the toxin botulin showed that the agent was not a viable aerosol biological weapon.Pike, John E. (webmaster). \\"Botulinum Toxins\\", Globalsecurity.org, accessed January 15, 2009. Tests were undertaken using four pound bombs filled with botulin.

No effective vaccine for the disease in humans has yet been developed. Hookworms, parasitic nematodes transmitted in soil, infect approximately 700 million humans, particularly in tropical regions of the world where endemic hookworms include Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Hookworms feed on blood and those infected with hookworms may suffer from chronic anaemia and malnutrition. View on Wikipedia Helminth infection can be effectively treated with benzimidazole drugs (such as mebendazole or albendazole), and efforts led by the World Health Organization have focused on one to three yearly de- worming doses in schools because hookworm infections with the heaviest intensities are most common in school-age children. However, these drugs only eliminate existing adult parasites and re-infection can occur soon after treatment, school-based de-worming efforts do not treat adults or pre-school children, and concerns exist about drug resistance developing in hookworms against the commonly used treatments, thus a vaccine against hookworm disease is sought to provide more permanent resistance to infection. Hookworm infection is considered a neglected disease as it disproportionately affects poorer localities and has received little attention from pharmaceutical companies. Mechanism of action Hookworm infections in humans can last for several years, and re-infection can occur very shortly after treatment, suggesting that hookworms effectively evadeand may interrupt or modulate the host immune system. Successful hookworm vaccines have been developed for several animal species. On the basis of prior work, human vaccine development has targeted antigens from both the larval and adult stages of the hookworm life cycle; a combined vaccine for humans that would provide more complete protection. Current targets of larval proteins attenuate larval migration through host tissue; targets of adult proteins have been demonstrated to block enzymes vital to hookworm feeding. The function of Na-ASP-2 is not currently known (though it may function as a chemotaxin mimic), but it is a cysteine- rich secretory protein that is released during parasite entry into the host. It may have some function in the transition from the larval environment stage of the hookworm life-cycle to an adult parasitic existence and tissue migration. The class of proteins that includes Na-ASP-2, ASPs, are promising vaccine candidates based on previous vaccine studies in sheep, guinea pigs, cattle, and mice, which have demonstrated inhibition of hookworm larval migration. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies determined that high titers of circulating antibodies against ASPs are associated with lower hookworm burdens in residents of Hainan Province, China, and Minas Gerais, Brazil. Ac-APR-1 is an aspartic protease, specifically a hemoglobinase, that participates in the hookworm's digestion of hemoglobin from its blood meal and is present in the adult stage of the hookworm life cycle. Animals immunized against Ac-APR-1 exhibited a reduction in worm burden, a reduction in hemoglobin loss, and a dramatic reduction in worm fecundity. Research Examples of antigenic targets of hookworm vaccines currently in clinical trials include Na-ASP-2 from N. americanus, Ac-APR-1 from Ancylostoma caninum, Ac'-APR-1 and Na- GST-1/Alhydroge. In a clinical trial a vaccine containing recombinant Na-ASP-2 with Alhydrogel as an adjuvant was found to increase Th2 helper cells and IgE. Both the Th2 helper cells and IgE antibody are important players in recognition and immunoregulation against parasites. The vaccine containing recombinant Na-ASP-2 resulted in significantly decreased risk of a hookworm infection. In 2014 Na-GST-1/Alhydroge completed a successful phase 1 clinical trial in Brazil. = Funding = life cycle Research funding to develop hookworm vaccines has come from the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative, a program of the Sabin Vaccine Institute and collaborations with George Washington University, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the Chinese Institute of Parasitic Diseases, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative Overview, Sabin Vaccine InstituteWorld Health Organization, Initiative for Vaccine Research, Hookworm disease Funding for hookworm vaccine research efforts also includes funds from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Researchers Cite Vaccines' Potential to Break Poverty Cycle; Genomics and Innovative Partnerships are Key to Parasitic and Bacterial Vaccine Development, Infection Control TodaySabin Vaccine Institute Receives $13.8M Gates Foundation Grant to Pursue Bivalent Hookworm Vaccination Strategy, redOrbit.com totaling in excess of $53 million, and additional support from the Rockefeller Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.In Brazil, Field Trials To Treat World's Poor, Washington Post, October 11, 2006 The government of Brazil, where hookworm is still endemic in some poorer areas, has promised to manufacture a vaccine if one can be proven effective.

Genet. His controversial appointment as city street commissioner over Daniel D. Conover resulted in the Police Riot of 1857.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 98-99) Biography Charles Devlin was born in Ireland and migrated to the United States at age 27. Shortly after his arrival in New York City, he worked as a journeyman baker in Frankfort Street and later started a successful bakery in the same area. During the 1840s, he contained contracts on the Hudson River Railroad and spent two years building several sections of railway track. It was after this enterprise that he became employed by the city as a contractor for the City Works department. He received several major contracts for Central Park, however the majority of his work concerned grading, paving, and general street improvements.\\"Death Of Charles Devlin.; Career Of The Contractor And The Bondsman Of William M. Tweed\\". _New York Times._ 2 Feb 1881 Devlin had a brief sting into local politics running against Robert McGinnis for a seat on the Board of Aldermen. His appointment by Mayor Fernando Wood as city street commissioner over Daniel D. Conover, who had been originally appointed by Governor John King, caused considerable controversy. Claims were made that Devlin had purchased the position from Wood for $50,000, and when Conover was thrown out of New York City Hall, attempts to serve two warrants for Wood's arrest resulted in the Police Riot of 1857. Devlin amassed a large personal fortune through this business and, at his height, was believed to be the largest contractor engaged in city works. He also became a noted bondsman, providing bail for such figures as Boss Tweed and Henry W. Genet, the latter bringing him to national attention during his criminal trial in 1872-73\\\\. He lost most of his wealth endorsing notes for many of his friends and declared bankruptcy in 1879. Devlin died from pneumonia at his East Fifty-Seventh Street home on the afternoon of February 1, 1881, and was buried in the family vault at Calvary Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three daughters and two sons; his daughter Isabella was the wife of lawyer Henry A. Brann, and Fanny was married to industrialist and real estate mogul William F. Croft.

It had been years since > I’d seen him, so it was really nice to hear what was going on in his life. > After we chatted for a bit, and they bought some candy (I slang candy like a > motherfucker), the fiancée handed me her card and told me that I should give > them a shout next time I was in San Diego. After they left, I looked at her > card. It said she was a travel writer. I thought to myself, 'Travel writer? > I wanna be a travel writer,' and it was then that I decided to be one.\\"p. 11 > Broke-Ass Stuart's Guide to Living Cheaply in New York City Falls Media 2008 Upon graduation from UCSC, he moved to San Francisco, compiled his knowledge on living a frugal lifestyle in the city and wrote the first edition of Broke- Ass Stuart’s Guide to Living Cheaply in San Francisco. The end product was a 33-page black and white zine printed on regular computer paper which he first made copies of at Kinko’s and later published at Pip Printing. The first fifty copies of the book quickly sold out, as did the next 100. The first edition sold around 1,000 copies and garnered him the \\"Best Local Zine\\" award in the SF Bay Guardian's Best of the Bay issue. \\"Broke-Ass Stuart’s Guide to Living Cheaply in San Francisco v.2,\\" still in the zine format, came out on July 2005 and sold 300 copies in the first week.

He traveled through Ireland for two months and composed narratives and tips geared towards the young and thrifty travelers of Europe. In November 2007, the third version of Broke-Ass Stuart’s Guide to Living Cheaply in San Francisco was released, this time with Falls Media publishing company. With the assistance of the publishing company, Schuffman was able to promote his book to a wider audience with increased internet presence, more television and radio appearances, and another book release party which was attended by over 700 people. December 7, 2008, marked the release of Broke-ass Stuart’s Guide to Living Cheaply in New York City. The release party for the book (also published by Falls Media) was held at the Delancey Bar and Night Club in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

He studied Law at Chuo University, and was President of Canon in the USA until 1989. Mitarai used a unique blend of eastern and western managerial styles to mold Canon into a highly successful company. Through a large overhaul he was able to bring the company back to profitability with a style that was coined \\"the Mitarai way.\\" Career In 1961, Fujio Mitarai joined Canon, training as an accountant. Mitarai was sent to the US to help Canon develop in the camera market. Upon arrival he discovered a financial disaster. He discovered that only $6,000 had been made on sales of $3 million. The auditors that advised Mitarai told him Canon should close its US operations and put the money in the bank as it would make more money off the interest. However, he chose to ignore their advice and take on the challenge of turning the company around. Mitarai noticed that Canon's US division was drastically inefficient especially when it came to their corporate structure. When Mitarai took an in-depth look at the company's corporate structure, he noticed that the different divisions within the company became so independent that they only thought about what would benefit their division, not the entire company. The lack of communication between divisions was astounding and it got to the point where divisions would be building separate factories in China at the same time. This kind of inefficiencies cost Canon dearly and in certain instances it would cost the company twice as much to do something. This was due to the fact that different branches would plan separately instead of together which would have allowed them to combine their costs. However, Mitarai didn't just overhaul the company's corporate structure. He was also responsible for launching several new Canon products, notably the Canon AE-1 35mm SLR camera that allowed amateur photographers to take high quality photos. These cameras helped Canon get to the top of the camera market and helped the company build the reputation that it possesses today. In 1984 Mitarai struck a deal with Hewlett-Packard (HP) to produce photocopiers using HP software and Canon laser printing. In 1989 Mitarai returned to Japan and found that several of the company's divisions were in the red, however he was unable to do anything about it until 1995 when he was made CEO. He began to shut down unprofitable divisions within the company and turned the focus of the company from sales to profits, and rewarded Canon's best performing staff. In Mitarai's quest to generate profits he also began to provide performance incentives to his managers. And in turn, the company's devoted managers contributed even more to the company's bottom line.

To define it this way, the concept of a set of illegal state as well a set of legal states needs to be introduced. In addition, since the behavior of a given DEVS model needs to define how the state transition change both when time is passed by and when an event occurs, it has been described by a much general formalism, called general system [ZPK00]. In this article, we use a sub-class of General System formalism, called timed event system instead. Depending on how the total state and the external state transition function of a DEVS model are defined, there are two ways to define the behavior of a DEVS model using Timed Event System.

In other words, the set of partial states is indeed S=\\\\\\\\{(d,\\\\sigma)d \\\\in S', \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}^\\\\infty \\\\\\\\} where S' is a state set. When a DEVS model receives an input event x \\\\in X, View1 resets the elapsed time t_e by zero, if the DEVS model needs to ignore x in terms of the lifespan control, modellers have to update the remaining time \\\\, \\\\sigma = \\\\sigma - t_e in the external state transition function \\\\delta_{ext} that is the responsibility of the modellers. Since the number of possible values of \\\\sigma is the same as the number of possible input events coming to the DEVS model, that is unlimited. As a result, the number of states s=(d, \\\\sigma) \\\\in S is also unlimited that is the reason why View2 has been proposed. If we don't care the finite-vertex reachability graph of a DEVS model, View1 has an advantage of simplicity for treating the elapsed time t_e=0 every time any input event arrives into the DEVS model. But disadvantage might be modelers of DEVS should know how to manage \\\\sigma as above, which is not explicitly explained in \\\\delta_{ext} itself but in \\\\Delta. = Features of View2 = View2 has been introduced by Hwang and Zeigler[HZ06][HZ07] in which given a total state q=(s, t_s, t_e) \\\\in Q , the remaining time, \\\\sigma is computed as \\\\, \\\\sigma = t_s - t_e. When a DEVS model receives an input event x \\\\in X, View2 resets the elapsed time t_e by zero only if \\\\delta_{ext}(q,x)=(s',1). If the DEVS model needs to ignore x in terms of the lifespan control, modellers can use \\\\delta_{ext}(q,x)=(s',0) . Unlike View1, since the remaining time \\\\sigma is not component of S in nature, if the number of states, i.e. Sis finite, we can draw a finite-vertex (as well as edge) state-transition diagram [HZ06][HZ07]. As a result, we can abstract behavior of such a DEVS-class network, for example SP-DEVS and FD- DEVS, as a finite-vertex graph, called reachability graph [HZ06][HZ07].

Early life Soriano was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Enrolling at the prestigious University of Buenos Aires Law School, he entered one of the university's numerous theatre groups and, leaving law school to devote himself to the theatre, he produced his first work, El chaleco encantado (\\"The Enchanted Sweater\\") in 1950, among four other works he completed and staged while in school. Soriano debuted professionally in a production of A Midsummernight's Dream at the renowned Colón Theatre, in 1953. Debuting in television in 1954, Soriano soon starred in leading roles in Argentine premieres of Paddy Chayefsky's The Tenth Man Marcel Achard's Voulez-vous jouer avec moi? (\\"Would You Like to Play with Me?\\"), Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! and Carlos Gorostiza's adaptation of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's Rashomon. These performances earned Soriano the \\"Martin Fierro\\" and \\"Cóndor del Plata\\" Prizes in 1964, two of the most coveted in Argentine entertainment. Having accepted occasional supporting roles in Argentine cinema, he was cast as the lead in Juan José Jusid's production of Roberto Cossa's tragedy, Tute Cabrero (1968) and in Raúl de la Torre's character study, Juan Lamaglia y Sra. (\\"Mr. and Mrs. Juan Lamaglia,\\" 1970). Career Opposite Julia von Grolman in Mr. and Mrs. Juan Lamaglia (1970). Soriano and friends, 1980. Soriano appeared in a number historical dramas during the turbulent 1970s. Given the title role in David Viñas' play, Lisandro (1971), he received plaudits for his portrayal of Senator Lisandro de la Torre, a fiery muck-raker remembered for his opposition to the excessive influence landowners exercised over government in the 1930s. Following a return to democracy in 1973, Soriano was cast as Schultz, the German, in Osvaldo Bayer's La Patagonia rebelde (\\"Rebellion in Patagonia,\\" 1974). The portrayal of the brutal repression of a 1922 sheep ranch workers' strike was made with the assistance of the progressive new Governor of Santa Cruz Province, Jorge Cepernic, and resulted in serious problems for both Cepernic and many of those involved in the film - including Soriano, who left for Spain in 1977. Anxious to improve their tarnished international image, the new military regime enlisted the relatively moderate General Roberto Viola to persuade exiled artists to return, which some, including Soriano, did. He was cast in the title role by Director Héctor Olivera's film version of Roberto Cossa's grotesque play, La nona (\\"Granma\\", 1979). The slow pace of liberalization in the dictatorship's policy towards the arts pushed artists led by playwrights Osvaldo Dragún and Carlos Gorostiza to create an Argentine Open Theatre movement in 1980, to which Soriano was one of the first and best- known adherents. Their July 28, 1981, maiden festival was a success marred by the fire bombing of their Picadero Theatre a week later (an unsolved mystery to this day). A return to democracy in 1983 allowed Argentine artists to create works critical of the climate of abuses prevalent during the preceding dictatorship and Soriano was cast as the lead in Mercedes Frutos' 1984 film version of Adolfo Bioy Casares' Otra esperanza (\\"Another Hope\\"), a horror narrative set in a factory with secrets - a timely metaphor for much of the repression that had targeted industrial workers. Soriano reprised his role of Senator Lisandro de la Torre in Juan José Jusid's Asesinato en el senado de la nación (\\"An Assassination in the Senate,\\" 1984), a historical drama on the 1935 attempted murder of the reformist senator. Soriano worked in the theatre less in subsequent years, continuing to accept leading roles in film and on Argentine television. He also starred in Spanish television and was featured for months in Farmacia de guardia (\\"Night Pharmacy\\"), among the highest-rated Spanish comedies of the 1990s. His grandfatherly appeal was in demand for Argentine period pieces such as Raúl de la Torre's Funes, un gran amor (\\"Funes, a Great Love,\\" 1993) and Héctor Olivera's Una sombra ya pronto serás (\\"A Shadow, You Shall Soon Be,\\" 1994). A similarly bucolic backdrop set the stage for his role as a dying idealist in Diego Arsuaga's El último tren (\\"The Last Train,\\" 2002), an Uruguayan film indicting unpatriotic business deals. Soraino has also recently turned to his Jewish roots in theatre works such as Jeff Baron's Visiting Mr. Green, where he teaches an unsympathetic parole officer a lesson in kinship and in cinema such as in the Chilean film, El brindis (\\"The Toast,\\" 2007), where a Jewish-Chilean patriarch struggles to bring his disparate family closer.

Life Hough graduated M.A. at Magdalen College in 1676.Concise Dictionary of National Biography When Henry Clerke died in 1687, there was a wide field of candidates as President of Magdalen College, but King James was determined not to have an anti-Catholic chosen. The college's Visitor was Peter Mews, and he proposed Baptist Levinz. John Younger and Thomas Smith of the college were reluctant to stand in the teeth of royal opposition. James recommended Anthony Farmer, a reputed Catholic, making the proposal one day after he announced universal religious toleration. Farmer's candidacy met with much opposition. James suggested Samuel Parker, Anglican Bishop of Oxford, as a compromise candidate. Hough was elected President in 1687, but was then officially replaced by Parker, after the prerogative Court of Ecclesiastical Commission was brought into the matter. Hough refused to submit, and three Commissioners arrived with cavalry: Thomas Cartwright, Sir Robert Wright and Sir Thomas Jenner. Parker then was put into place over protests, but died, early in 1688, and his successor was Bonaventure Giffard, Catholic vicar-apostolic, 26 Fellows of Magdalen having by then been deprived of their fellowships over the business.

Plot summary Fifteen-year-old Jess, a dedicated swimmer, dotes on her grandfather, a fiercely independent and cantankerous artist. When he falls ill, he insists on returning to the isolated valley where he lived as a child to finish his last painting, a haunting landscape called 'River Boy'. Jess is desperately trying to cope with the knowledge that her grandfather is dying, but she does her best to help him finish the painting that is so important to him. While exploring the valley, Jess feels a strange presence and sees a mysterious boy in the river, now there, now gone. When she eventually meets the boy, he gives her some surprising advice that leads to the painting being finished against everyone's expectations. In return, he challenges her to join him in swimming down the river from the source to the sea, over forty miles. Jess refuses, saying she must stay with her grandfather, and watches him dive from the waterfall into the river. Soon after, hearing about her grandfather as a boy, she has a sudden revelation, and she swims after the boy to the mouth of the river, where he is waiting for her before finally disappearing. Jess then learns that her grandfather has died peacefully, leaving her his painting of the 'River Boy', which she now realizes is both a landscape and a portrait of the boy she met – a self- portrait.

It may have included the aillurehue of the Cauquenes north of the Itata, who occasionally fought with them against the Spanish in the sixteenth century and earlier against the Inca in the Battle of the Maule. Among the Moluche south of the Bio Bio River there were by the seventeenth century, three Butalmapu, that conformed with the main territorial identities of the Moluche: Lafkenmapu, the coastal region, Lelfünmapu the plains of the Intermediate Depression and Inapiremapu the foothills of the Andes. One other Piremapu in the Andes mountain range, was inhabited by the Pehuenches.Ricardo E. Latcham, La organización social … pg. 599-602. Each butalmapu was made up of several smaller confederations; aillarehues, that were made up of a number of familial clans of the same region, known as lofs. In case of an external danger or the beginning of a military campaign, the loncos (caciques) of all the lofs chose a supreme military leader of the Butalmapu, called the Toqui and Gran Toqui by the Spaniards. This leader had the right to make military decisions and usually only left his position when the campaign finished or he died. Butalmapus were not described as such in Spanish chronicles until the Cautiverio feliz y razón individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile, of Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñán, where an account of these confederations first occurred. They were called by Núñez “utanmapu”.Ricardo E. Latcham, La organización social …, pg. 139.

London, HMSO, p.13. Geography =Geology= Brockley Hill is the eastern arm of a long hill centred on Stanmore. The top of the hill is capped with \\"Stanmore Gravel\\", which is the remnant of a layer of gravel laid down by a river system pre- dating the Thames. Under the gravel are layers of sand, silt and clay about 15 metres thick known as the Claygate Beds.

British Geological Survey. This arrangement is typical of hills bounding the Thames Valley. =Roads= The A5 Trunk road runs across the summit of Brockley Hill using the same alignment of the highway (also known as Watling Street) built by the Romans in the 1st century AD. The southerly approach climbs to a height of in a distance of from the junction of Spur Road, Edgware. The area might be the location of Sulloniacis, a way point for the Cursus publicus (Roman Imperial mail service). A smaller Roman road is supposed to have branched off from the top of Brockley Hill in the direction of Watford, King's Langley, Berkhampstead, and Tring, however, there is no evidence of this route according to studies of the parish boundaries.Sir J. Evans, Archaeological Survey of Hertfordshire, 1892. On the northerly descent, the highway drops to Elstree Hill Roundabout over . Although both sections of Roman road approaching Brockley Hill are straight, a direct course across the summit was abandoned in favour of a double-bend alignment. This was employed to alleviate ascent of the hill because of the steepness in the terrain. The M1 motorway and the A41 Watford Way trunk road both pass through the valley between Brockley Hill and Elstree Hill to the North. =Administrative area= Brockley Hill was in Stanmore, Gore Hundred, in the County of Middlesex until the abolition of Middlesex in 1965. Since then the road named Brockley Hill, including the properties on both sides of it, and all the fields and properties to the west, are in Stanmore, in the London Borough of Harrow; the fields to the east of the road are in Edgware, London Borough of Barnet. =Nearby places= *Stanmore *Edgware *Bushey Heath *Elstree *Borehamwood *Mill Hill History Brockley Hill is situated on the ancient Watling Street, which was improved during the early part of the Roman occupation. The section running roughly North from Marble Arch runs in a straight line as far as the summit of Brockley Hill, following which there is a double curve to meet the alignment of the next section. The Roman engineers' practice was to use a high point as a sighting-pointMargary, Ivan D, Roman Roads in Britain. London, 1955 (revised edition, 1967). and clearly Brockley Hill was used in this way. The sandy clay found at the top of the hill was used for the manufacture of pottery during the Roman period, and it was one of the most important potteries in southern Britain in the later first century.Hendon and District Archaeological Society, Edited by Pamela Taylor, A Place In Time. Hendon, 1989. The area was known as Sulloniacis in the Roman period.Branigan, Keith, 'The Catuvellauni' (Alan Sutton Publishing, 1985) p. 147 The antiquarian Daniel Lysons noted the long history of Roman finds in the area in his 1795 book The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex and quoted a country proverb: \\"No heart can think, nor tongue can tell, what lies between Brockley-hill and Pennywell\\", which he interprets in terms of finding Roman treasure. Pennywell is in Elstree, some 1,500 metres north of Brockley Hill. What now lies between Brockley Hill and Pennywell includes eight lanes of fast moving traffic, as both the M1 motorway and the A41 Watford Bypass pass through this area. The Eastern end of the Dark Ages linear earthwork known as Grim's Ditch or Grimsdyke is close to Brockley Hill. Bricks were made on the hill in the 18th century. The first hospital on the site of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital was founded in 1882; the RNOH bought the site and premises in 1920. In the 1930s, an extension of the London Underground's Northern line was planned to run from Edgware to Bushey Heath. Brockley Hill station would have been situated at the southern foot of Brockley Hill; however, the work was abandoned at the outbreak of World War II. The lower courses of a brick viaduct - that would have carried the line through the station - are still visible in 'Arches Field'. With the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, the line was deemed unnecessary because the planned housing developments around Brockley Hill were banned within the newly defined Metropolitan Greenbelt.

It is based on the children's television series H.R. Pufnstuf. Plot After Jimmy (Jack Wild) gets kicked out of the school band for tripping and breaking a drum kit, he then ventures on a journey with his newly magical talking flute Freddy. Orchestrated by Witchiepoo (Billie Hayes), he ends up on an evil boat which takes him to Living Island, an island where everything is alive. Once there, he befriends many of the island's inhabitants led by Mayor H.R. Pufnstuf (voiced by Al Melvin), but the evil Witchiepoo is determined to steal Freddy the Flute away from him in order to impress the visiting Witches' Council and the Boss Witch (Martha Raye) enough to win the Witch of the Year Award. The witch steals the flute by disguising herself as a pretty dance instructor. Jimmy and his new friends get the flute back by having Gopher dig a tunnel to Witchiepoo's castle and faking a fire. Witchiepoo retaliates by bombing and destroying Pufnstuf's town. During the bombing she is blown away by a cowboy head which destroys her flying vehicle. Jimmy feels bad for endangering the Living Island inhabitants and decides to leave with his flute without telling them, to keep them from further danger. Witchiepoo returns to Pufnstuf's town and shrinks all the inhabitants to put them in her castle dungeon as prisoners. Jimmy finds this out and decides to try to save them. Witchiepoo invites the Witches' Council for a convention and prepares Pufnstuf to be the main meal. Jimmy disguises himself as a witch to enter with the other witches. Jimmy gets found out while trying to save Pufnstuf and is put in the dungeon with the others. Mole digs into the dungeon to save them, all except Pufnstuf who will soon be cooked. Once back at the town they plan a rescue. A book tells them the only thing that scares witches is a good fairy angel. They all dress up as white good fairy angels, raid the castle, scare off the Witches Council, and save Pufnstuf. Once they are gone Witchiepoo is the only witch to find out they were faking, she flies to try to catch up and tell the other witches to come back. En route, her minion sees the good guys at the town; she orders him to use her doomsday bomb on them but also says to take the wheel. Her minion accidentally drops the bomb inside the vehicle while literally taking the wheel, blowing themselves up in a large explosion.

At least one submarine is always armed and on active service, carrying up to 16 Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Each missile has a range of 7000 miles (11,000 km), and can carry 12 independently controlled warheads each capable of destroying a large city. The letters of last resort are four identically worded handwritten letters from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the commanding officers of the four British ballistic missile submarines. They contain orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the British government and has killed or otherwise incapacitated both the prime minister and the \\"second person\\" (normally a high-ranking member of the Cabinet, such as the Deputy Prime Minister or the First Secretary of State) whom the prime minister has designated to make a decision on how to act in the event of the prime minister's death. In the event that the orders are carried out, the action taken could be the last official act of the Government of the United Kingdom. The letters are destroyed unopened after a prime minister leaves office, so their content remains known only to the prime minister who issued them. Process The letters are written as soon as a new prime minister takes office, after they have been told by the Chief of the Defence Staff \\"precisely what damage a Trident missile could cause\\". These are then delivered to the submarines, with the previous prime minister's letters being destroyed without being opened. In the event of the deaths of both the prime minister and the designated alternative decision-maker as a result of a nuclear strike, the commander(s) of the nuclear submarine(s) (at any time at least one is on patrol) would use a series of checks to ascertain whether the letters of last resort will have to be opened. According to Peter Hennessy's book The Secret State: Whitehall and the Cold War, 1945 to 1970, the process by which a commander would determine if the British government continues to function includes, amongst other checks, establishing whether BBC Radio 4 continues broadcasting. In 1983, the procedure for Polaris submarines was to open the envelopes if there was an evident nuclear attack, or if all UK naval broadcasts had ceased for four hours. Options While the contents of these letters are secret, according to the December 2008 BBC Radio 4 documentary The Human Button, there were four known options given to the prime minister to include in the letters. The prime minister might instruct the submarine commander to: * retaliate with nuclear weapons; * not retaliate; * use their own judgement; or * place the submarine under an allied country's command, if possible. The documentary mentions Australia and the United States. The Guardian reported in 2016 that the options are said to include: \\"Put yourself under the command of the US, if it is still there\\", \\"Go to Australia\\", \\"Retaliate\\", or \\"Use your own judgement\\". The actual option chosen remains known only to the writer of the letter, as they are destroyed unopened when a prime minister leaves office.

It operates as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. As of June 1, 2015, WWP served 71,866 registered alumni and 11,494 registered members. The organization has partnered with several other charities, including the American Red Cross, Resounding Joy, a music therapy group in California, and Operation Homefront. WWP has also provided a year-long Track program, which helps veterans transition to college and the workplace. History Wounded Warrior Project was founded in 2003 in Roanoke, Virginia, by John Melia., archived by WebCite here Melia had been severely wounded in a helicopter crash while serving in Somalia in 1992. Melia assembled backpacks distributed to injured veterans at the former Bethesda Naval Hospital (now the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center) and Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Wounded Warrior Project initially operated as a division of the United Spinal Association of New York, which adopted WWP as a program in November 2003. The WWP continued to support injured service members by providing them with free WWP Backpacks filled with comfort items In September 2005, The United Spinal Association granted $2.7 million to WWP to \\"develop into a stand-alone charity with its own identity and programs,\\" with the intent to expand its services from providing immediate comfort items to providing longer-term support for returning wounded veterans via compensation, education, health care, insurance, housing, employment, etc. The WWP Backpacks program remains a central activity of WWP, evidenced by the more than 65,000 backpacks the organization had distributed as of early 2018, in support of transitioning U.S. military veterans. CEO Steven Nardizzi and COO Al Giordano were fired from Wounded Warrior Project after it was revealed in 2016 that they spent massive amounts of the nonprofit's money on lavish company retreats and personal enrichment for themselves.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/02/08/wounded- warrior-project-cleared-of-spending-lavishly-report-finds/ Several former employees alleged that they were fired because they raised concerns over the mismanagement. Incorporation Wounded Warrior Project registered for incorporation on February 23, 2005. WWP was granted accreditation as of September 10, 2008, by the Veterans Affairs Secretary as a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) \\"recognized by the Secretary for the purpose of preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\" The Veterans Administration's online List of Representatives for Accredited Organizations includes contact information for WWP's accredited service officers. as well as a search tool to access information about other VSOs. In July 2006, WWP's headquarters were moved to Jacksonville, Florida. WWP Founder John Melia cited a strong local veteran community, access to Jacksonville International Airport, and support from the local business community, specifically the PGA Tour, as the reason for the move. The WWP headquarters will be undergoing a major $1.3 million renovation according to the Jacksonville Business Journal.  Veterans and Military Support Programs  = Family Support Programs = Wounded Warrior Project helps families of veterans reconnect through events that support family bonding and transitional skills. By providing the space and time for veterans to spend time with their loved ones, the transition from service member to civilian gets that much easier. Through their veteran family support programs, Wounded Warrior Project also helps guide families through the sometimes confusing process of receiving VA benefits. = Warriors To Work = Warriors to work is a veteran employment program that connects veterans with employers and resources for jobs. Through career counseling, veterans can find work that best fits their skill sets and allows them to smoothly transition into civilian life. = Mental Wellness = With a rate of 11-20% service members living with PTSD, veteran mental health programs are an important staple in a veterans journey to mental wellness. Wounded Warrior Project provides interactive programs, rehabilitation retreats, and free mental health counseling. Mental health problems such as PTSD and TBI are properly addressed through WWP’s outpatient care and therapy sessions.  Controversy  On May 27, 2014, WWP filed a lawsuit against Dean Graham, a disabled veteran with PTSD, and his Help Indiana Vets, Inc. organization. After a court ruling, Graham retracted the allegations he leveled against Wounded Warrior Project and folded his direct-aid non-profit. In 2016 and 2017, however, subsequent investigations by a Jacksonville, FL television station and the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee found that WWP \\"'inaccurately' reported the money it spent on veterans’ programs by using 'inflated' numbers and 'misleading' advertisements.\\" WWP filed a lawsuit in October 2014 seeking damages and court costs against a Blandon, Pennsylvania, non-profit, Keystone Wounded Warriors, claiming confusing similarities between Keystone's and WWP's logos; Hampton Roads, VA Channel 3 TV covered the Keystone story on April 30, 2015, and Nonprofit Quarterly covered the story with a title asking, is WWP \\"a 'Neighborhood Bully' among Veterans Groups?\\" Tim Mak also covered the suit for the Daily Beast. After a reporter for the Tacoma, Washington News Tribune informed disabled veteran Airman Alex Graham, a blogger at the conspiracy website Veterans Today, of a pending lawsuit against him by the WWP, he removed his articles critical of their policies, later retracting his criticisms and issuing a public apology.  Title 38  In March 2014, WWP testified before Congress that they strongly supported the bill \\"To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide veterans with counseling and treatment for sexual trauma that occurred during inactive duty training (H.R. 2527; 113th Congress)\\". The bill would extend a VA program of counseling and care and services for veterans for military sexual trauma that occurred during active duty or active duty for training to veterans who experienced such trauma during inactive duty training. The bill would alter current law, which allows access to such counseling only to active duty members of the military, so that members of the Reserves and National Guard would be eligible. The WWP did a study of its alumni and found that, \\"almost half of the respondents indicated accessing care through VA for MST-related conditions was 'very difficult'. And of those who did not seek VA care, 41% did not know they were eligible for such care.\\" The WWP also testified that in addition to expanding access to MST care, the VA needed to improve care itself, because veterans report \\"inadequate screening, providers who were either insensitive or lacked needed expertise and facilities ill-equipped to appropriately care for MST survivors.\\"  Donations and spending  In 2012, WWP spent US $114,817,090 on programs in support of wounded veterans, their families, and caregivers. In 2013, a new employee mistakenly declined to accept a donation from Liberty Baptist Church in Fort Pierce, Florida, and issued this inadvertent statement to the church leaders in an email, \\"We must decline the opportunity to be the beneficiary of your event due to our fundraising event criteria, which doesn't allow community events to be religious in nature.\\" Shortly after the church received this letter, a WWP spokesperson apologized and said that it was a miscommunication. In June 2015, the Daily Beast reported that the WWP sells its donor information to third parties. It also alleged that WWP distributed what it deemed an insubstantial percentage of donations to actual wounded warriors, and that it overpaid its executive staff. In January 2016, The New York Times reported that only 60 percent of the revenue of the Wounded Warrior Project is spent on programs to help veterans; the remaining 40 percent was overhead. It also reported claims of work environment of coercion, and multiple terminations. That same month, CBS News disclosed that the WWP had grown to spend millions of dollars annually on team-building events. In March 2016, Wounded Warrior Project's board of directors dismissed the charity's top two executives, Steven Nardizzi and Al Giordano, after hiring the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett to perform an independent review of spending issues related to the company's funds. Board chairman Anthony Odierno was announced as temporarily taking control of the charity. In October 2016, Charity Navigator dropped Wounded Warrior Project from its \\"watch list\\", and later boosted the nonprofit's score to a four-star rating (out of four stars). In February 2017, the Better Business Bureau released a report clearing Wounded Warrior Project of the \\"lavish spending\\" allegations, and \\"found the organization’s spending to be consistent with its programs and mission.\\"  Charity ratings  According to a 2013 article in Nonprofit Quarterly, \\"Depending on the rater, the Wounded Warriors Project seems to have scored low (Charity Watch), high (BBB Wise Giving Alliance) or somewhere in the middle (Charity Navigator)\\". However, for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2016, Charity Watch assigned WWP a C+ rating (up from a D originally) and Charity Navigator published its rating for WWP on 1 February 2017 as \\"four out of four stars\\" (up from three). As of August 2018, that rating had dropped back down to 3 stars. According to Charity Navigator, WWP allocates 75.1 percent of its revenue to program expenses and 24.7 percent to fundraising and administrative expenses. In January 2017 The Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance renewed its accreditation of WWP, for the next two years, as meeting the 20 standards for charity accountability.

Life Giulio Antonio Acquaviva was born at Atri, the son of Giosia Acquaviva, 6th Duke of Atri and Count of San Flaviano, and his wife Antonella Migliorati. He was a member of a patrician family of the Kingdom of Naples with large estates in Abruzzo, and held the titles of Duke of Atri, Count of San Flaviano and Giulianova, Lord of Forcella, Roseto, Padula, and was the first Duke of Teramo. By his marriage with Caterina del Balzo Orsini, his family obtained the title of counts of Conversano, which they retained until the early nineteenth century. After the battle of San Flaviano (or Battle of Tordino) between Francesco Sforza and Niccolò Piccinino on 25 July 1460, San Flaviano was sacked by Matteo di Capua's soldiers the following year and reduced to rubble. Instead of restoring the city, in 1471 Giulio Antonio Acquaviva preferred to build a new one higher up near the ancient city: Giulianova. It was an interesting example of renaissance ideal city, applying the theory of the most important architects of the time, as Leon Battista Alberti and Francesco Di Giorgio Martini. In 1478 he commanded the fleet that supported the Neapolitan army of King Ferrante of Aragon, which had joined the coalition formed by Pope Sixtus IV against the Republic of Florence. For having guided and advised the Duke of Calabria, son of the King, he was awarded the Order of the Ermine. Moreover, with the privilege of the King of Naples on April 30, 1479, he received the honour of being able to add the name of Aragon to his surname and to add to the family coat of arms the insignia of the royal house. In 1479 he obtained from the Neapolitan king the surname \\"Acquaviva of Aragon\\". In 1480 he went to Apulia to fight the Turks, who had taken Otranto and threatened Brindisi. During the campaign for the reconquest of Otranto in 1481, he lost his life in an ambush at Serrano. His body was beheaded and his head was taken by the Turks and sent to Constantinople to the Sultan as a war trophy and never returned for any ransom. The body is buried, together with his wife, in the church of Santa Maria dell'Isola in Conversano, in a funeral monument by the Apulian sculptor Nuzzo Barba.Mario Bevilacqua, Giulianova - La costruzione di una città ideale del Rinascimento, Electa Napoli, Napoli, 2002, p. 136. Giulio Antonio died at Minervino di Lecce, and was succeeded in Conversano by his son Andrea Matteo. Another son was Belisario Acquaviva. His latter day descendants include: Giulio Antonio Acquaviva (c 1808- 1836), Naples Italy, Príncipe Giuseppe Colonna Acquaviva (c 1835-1905), Naples Campania, Italy; Maria Acquaviva (c 1855- 1905) Naples, and Anna Maria Acquaviva di Lorenzo (c 1883- 1956), Naples Campania, Italy. Family Giulio Antonio Acquaviva married Caterina Orsini del Balzo in 1456, the natural daughter of the Prince of Taranto Giovanni Antonio Del Balzo Orsini, Countess of Conversano and Lady of Bitetto, Casamassima, Castellana, Gioia del Colle, Noci and Turi. They had four children: * Giovanni Antonio (1457-1479), Marquis of Bitonto, died during his stay in Pisa; * Andrea Matteo (1458-1529), married for the first time Isabella Todeschini Piccolomini d'Aragona, daughter of Antonio, 1st Duke of Amalfi and Count of Celano, and remained a widower in his second marriage in 1509 Caterina Della Ratta. Duke of Atri (from 1481) and Count of Conversano and Giulia, he was one of the richest and most powerful feudal lords of the Kingdom of Naples. From 1509 the Acquaviva family succeeded the Della Ratta family as counts (later princes) of Caserta, who had maintained this title since 1310. * Donato, bishop of Conversano from 1499 to 1528;Donato was the brother of the Marquis de Bitonto and of Bishop Sulpicio Acquaviva. Donato d'Aragona was appointed Bishop of Conversano at the age of 24, and thus was only Administrator of the diocese for three years, until he reached the age of 27, when he could be consecrated in accordance with Canon Law. He held the rank of Protonotary Apostolic. Eubel, II, p. 135, with note 3. * Belisario (1464-1528), 1st Duke of Nardò (from 12 March 1497) and 14th Count of Conversano. He was a leader in the service of the King of the Kingdom of Naples and of the Emperor Charles V. He married Sveva Sanseverino of the princes of Bisignano; his daughter Andreana was duchess of Galatina and married Ferrante Castriota Scanderbeg (descendant of the leader Giorgio Castriota Scanderbeg). Giulio Antonio Acquaviva then remarried with Maria Spinelli. His illegitimate son, Sulpicio, became Bishop of Conversano from 1483 until his death in 1494; References 1420s births 1481 deaths People from the Province of Teramo Condottieri Giulio Antonio Acquaviva ","title":"Giulio Antonio Acquaviva"},{"id":"21117163","text":"Milkor (Pty) Ltd is a privately owned South African company established in 1980.

These lines usually occur around holes or obstructions and cause locally weak areas in the molded part.KNIT LINES, Texas Plastic Technologies Knit lines are considered molding defects, and occur when the mold or/and material temperatures are set too low: thus the materials will be cold when they meet, so that they do not bond perfectly. This can cause a weak area in the part which can cause breakage when the part is under stress. Weld lines therefore occur during machine start-up, when equilibrium conditions have not been met. Mouldings made in this setting-up period must be rejected. There are many Computer Aided Engineering tools that are available that can predict where these areas could occur, but a skilled designer will be able to predict where such defects can be found by examining the tool or product. Weld lines are not found in other manufacturing methods such as Rotational moulding, but can exist in extrusion, especially where there are internal metal supports for a die. The defects are then known as spider lines.  Causes  Weld lines can be caused by several different problems: * Low temperature of injection moulding machine barrel * Inadequate back pressure * Injection pressure or injection speed is too low * Low mold temperature * Small injection gates and/or runners * Improper location of injection gate * Too many gates * Excessive gate land length * Improper flow rate of injected materials * Inconsistent process cycle * poor product design  References  Injection molding ","title":"Weld line"},{"id":"21117183","text":"Jasin may refer to: *Jasin District in Malacca, Malaysia *Jasin, Malacca, a town in Jasin District *Jasin (federal constituency) in Malacca, Malaysia *Jasin, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, a village in north-central Poland *Jasin, Greater Poland Voivodeship a village in west-central Poland See also * Yasin (disambiguation) ","title":"Jasin"},{"id":"21117205","text":"Tabor () is a small village in the Municipality of Sežana in the Littoral region of Slovenia.Sežana municipal site The local church is dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria and belongs to the Parish of Štjak.Roman Catholic Diocese of Koper List of Churches May 2008 References External links *Tabor on Geopedia Populated places in the Municipality of Sežana ","title":"Tabor, Sežana"},{"id":"21117206","text":"Al Daih () is a village on the north of Bahrain.

Bergeret worked at the Hôpital Civil d’Arbois. He was a friend of Louis Pasteur (1822–1895). Bergeret is famous for his early use of insects in a criminal investigation making him one of the first forensic entomologists.Mark Benecke: A brief survey of the history of forensic entomology, Acta Biologica Benrodis 14 (2008): 15-38. Bergeret performed an autopsy on the mummified body of an infant discovered in a Paris house in 1855. He recognized and drew conclusions from the pattern of succession of different insect species onto the corpse, and also saw the significance of the duration of the life cycles of the different cadaver insects. His analysis of the insect evidence led to the conclusion that the child had died seven years earlier. The police suspects were the young couple occupying the house seven years before, in 1848, and they were subsequently arrested and convicted of murder of the child. In 1866 he published The Preventive Obstacle or Conjugal Onanism in which he expressed his disapproval of sexual activity for anything but procreation, linking it to cases of physical dysfunction and disease he had treated as a doctor, as well as to moral degeneration. In another work, he discusses the dangers of alcoholism to family and society.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Islam and Hinduism had coexisted in India for over a thousand years. Barring the occasional outbursts of violence, the two religious communities had lived together peacefully and shared strong social bonds except marriage. English education, however, drove a wedge between the communities. India of the early 1930s consisted of a great mass of poor and illiterate people who were exploited by the rich and powerful, irrespective of caste or religion. The author has sympathy for these poor and toiling masses are clearly reflected in his writings. It is against this backdrop that Premchand wrote Karmabhumi. Being greatly influenced by Gandhiji's satyagraha movement, Premchand weaves this novel around the social goals championed by it. Human life is portrayed as a field of action in which the character and destinies of individuals are formed and revealed through their actions. Some of these actions, which might seem melodramatic in ordinary realistic fiction, gain resonance in Karmabhumi, placed as they are in this symbolic and philosophical framework. Each character (or group) is depicted as coming to a point of moral awakening where he, she, or they must act on their convictions. The climax takes place in an assembly of the poor and dispossessed, where they voice their demand for land. The youngest of the speakers is put to death by a policeman's bullet, and this incident eventually leads to victory of the cause of land for the poor. Synopsis Amarkant is an intelligent and idealistic, though weak, young man who has grown up hating his father's business and adherence to the formalities of Hindu religion. He is married to Sukhada who is beautiful and intelligent but dominates him through her logical and down- to-earth approach to life. Denied love at home and stifled by his wife, Amarkant is attracted to their watchman's granddaughter, the modest and courteous Sakina. When his father refuses to accept Sakina, Amarkant leaves home to wander from village to village. Finally settling in a village of Untouchables, he teaches children and help villagers in their fight for relief against land tax. Initially unable to comprehend her husband's sympathy for the poor, Sukhada is ultimately drawn into the movement when she sees the police firing on a non-violent demonstration for acceptance of the Untouchables inside temples. She instantaneously gains recognition and acceptance as a leader of city's poor and downtrodden. Impelled by the desire to gain similar recognition, Amarkant deviates from the path of non-violence in favour of direct confrontation that leads to many casualties among the farmers. He finally realizes that the Gandhian path was the better one and returns to its fold.

This position exists in schools in the United Kingdom, but not in most public schools in the United States. They oversee the business management of schools – all the administrative and logistical aspects of running a school so that these are done in the most effective and efficient way possible. Through this, they free up the school’s headteacher to focus on leading teaching and learning. Although generally not in possession of Qualified Teacher Status, SBMs with appropriate training and experience are increasingly serving on the school’s leadership team, bringing additional leadership skills and a commercial outlook to the school’s strategic decision making. Almost all secondary schools and about a third of primary schools have school business managers serving on their leadership team. The SBM role has evolved from that of the school bursar, but whereas bursars typically focus on purely financial administrative matters, SBMs have a broader remit. SBM duties vary from school-to-school and include:  Financial management, including setting budgets, negotiating contracts with suppliers  Financial reporting, fundraising and making best use of resources  Management of support staff, such as teaching assistants, catering staff and cleaners premises management  Human resources, including overseeing staff training strategic planning, including meeting long-term education challenges and developments, such as the Every Child Matters Agenda  Health and safety  Relationship management with other schools and external partners In secondary schools – or where groups of schools are working together in a cluster or federation – SBMs will often have a broader, more strategic role, with some functions delegated to administrative support staff. In primary schools, an SBM may have an even more hands-on role, spending time on detailed administrative and financial tasks. The SBM position is still evolving, with higher-level, more strategic roles, such as Advanced School Business Managers and School Business Directors, emerging. The potential of these is being tested through a series of demonstration projects. The profession required a set of standards like that of other professional professions. The National Association of School Business Management (NASBM) have launched a set of professional standards available via the following link: www.nasbm.co.uk/professionalstandards - this project will soon link to future new qualifications. School business managers can study for a number of professional qualifications through the National College for School Leadership* and its School Business Manager Development Programme. These qualifications are the Certificate of School Business Management (CSBM), the Diploma of School Business Management (DSBM), and the Advanced Diploma of School Business management launched in March 2008. The senior course, the School Business Director's Course (SBD), was launched in 2010 and lasts around 18 months. They are delivered through a series of cohorts during the year, using a mixture of face-to-face residential elements, self-directed study and e-learning. The qualifications are internationally accredited by the Institute of Administrative Management. * Now called the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL). Note that the National College for Teaching and Leadership (formerly the National College for School Leadership) based in Nottingham, England, ceased its direct involvement with school business management training in 2014/15. However, SBM programmes continue to be offered by various other providers, including those originally commissioned by the NCTL.

Shire Brook is a small stream in the south eastern part of the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. It rises in the suburb of Gleadless Townend and flows in a general easterly direction for to its confluence with the River Rother between Beighton and Woodhouse Mill. In the past the brook has been both the border of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and between the sees of Canterbury and York.History of Beighton , beighton4life, accessed 17 January 2008 The course of the stream has been influenced by human intervention in the 20th century with the brook being diverted underground and flowing through culverts on three occasions as it traverses locations which were formerly landfill sites and extensive railway sidings. Course Shire Brook rises as an underground spring at a height of above sea level beneath the Red Lion public house in the Gleadless Townend residential area at . The Brook runs in a culvert from beneath the public house before emerging into the open on land between Seagrave Crescent and Lister Crescent. It initially flows NE going beneath housing to emerge on the Jaunty Park recreation and sports grounds as an insignificant and rubbish strewn stream running at the rear of the Birley Vale Industrial Estate. It is then joined by an unnamed stream which originates from a spring in Hollinsend Park. After it passes under the A6135 (Birley Moor Road) and swings easterly, disappearing underground, as it flows for almost through a culvert beneath the former Normanton Spring landfill site which has now been landscaped and planted with trees. The brook emerges and continues its journey east going through Wickfield Heath and under the A57 road (Mosborough Parkway) before flowing through the Shire Brook Valley Local Nature Reserve on the northern side of the A57. At this point the brook receives its only sizeable tributary, an unnamed stream which rises at Birley Spa at a height of above sea level, flowing NE down a gorge for a kilometre to the Shire Brook valley. The Shire Brook then disappears underground again as it runs beneath the former Beighton Road landfill site just to the north of Beighton before entering an area of wetland rich in bird life known as Beighton Marsh. The final of Shire Brook’s journey before it joins the Rother is again through an underground culvert beneath the site of the former Woodhouse Junction railway sidings which is now disused brownfield land which was being considered by Network Rail as a location for a new National Engineering Centre before plans were rejected in April 2008.BBC South Yorkshire.

History =Ancient boundary= Shire Brook has been an important boundary line for over a thousand years. In Anglo-Saxon times the Brook formed the boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. For 900 years the Brook marked the division between Yorkshire and Derbyshire, this gave the Brook its name, it was also known informally as County Brook and Der Brook, Der being short for Derbyshire. Another alternative name for the brook was Ochre Dike, this was due to the run off from mines in the valley which made the water a yellow brown colour.Gleadless: From Village To Suburb, Pauline Shearstone, Gives alternative name of Ochre Dike. In 1967 the City of Sheffield expanded its borders south to take in the suburbs of Hackenthorpe and Mosborough and the Brook no longer marked the frontier between the two counties. The Brook also marks the boundary between the Ecclesiastical provinces of York and Canterbury.Walks in the Shire Brook Valley. Gives details of ancient boundary. =Former industry= Up to the early 18th century the Shire Brook valley was mostly an agricultural area. However sustained industrial development came into the valley at the start of the 18th century and actually started in Tudor times when Christopher Chapman was producing cutlery at Carr Forge in the mid-16th century. Like many of Sheffield’s water courses, the Shire Brook’s water power was harnessed for turning water wheels for industry before the coming of steam and electricity. During the 19th century there were five wheels operating in the valley producing power to sharpen scythes and sickles. Several of the small mill ponds that once fed the water wheels still exist along the course of the river. The Upper and Lower Sickle wheels were in the Normanton Spring area, about from the Brook’s source. Further downstream were Carr Forge and Rainbow Forge while the Cliff Wheel was located just under from the Brooks confluence with the River Rother. Notable owners and users of these wheels were the Staniforth family that ran the Thomas Staniforth & Co sickleworks in Hackenthorpe. The dam at Rainbow Forge no longer holds water and its embankments and stonework are difficult to find amongst the undergrowth. Carr Forge Dam is the best preserved area of water in the valley although its wheel and cottages have now vanished. The site of the Lower Sickle Wheel (also known as Nether Wheel) was excavated in 1988 revealing the foundations of the mill buildings and the pits which held the grinding wheels.Information Board at Nether Wheel gives details of water wheels in valley Small scale coal mining took place in the valley from the early 18th century, however it was not until the opening of the Birley Collieries that large amounts of coal were extracted. Birley West Colliery was located just to the south of Normanton Spring, production lasted from 1855 until 1908. Birley East, situated between Hackenthorpe and Woodhouse opened in 1888 and operated until 1948. Shire Brook was culverted under both locations which became landfill sites when the pits closed. Both landfill sites have been capped off and landscaped in recent years.History in the Shire Brook Valley, Leaflet published by Sheffield City Council, Parks, Woodlands and Countryside Department.

The reserve is based around the former site of the Coisley Hill Sewage Works which closed in the early 1990s. The managers office has been converted into a visitors centre. The reserve includes Beighton Marsh, an area of reed-grass swamp, situated at its eastern end, which supports birds such as reed bunting, grasshopper warbler and barn owl, as well as mammals such as harvest mouse and water vole.

Seventeen people were killed as a result.Wagener, 1997 Late in the afternoon on the day of the failure, a thunderstorm occurred and about 50 mm of rain fell within 30 minutes. When the dam failed, 600 000 m³ of liquid flowed 4 km. The nearest houses were located 300 m downslope of the dam; when the wave of water and tailings reached them, it was 2.5 m high. Seventeen people were killed and there was widespread devastation and environmental damage. Eighty houses were destroyed.Niekerk, 2005 Background When gold-bearing rock is processed and the gold is extracted, the remaining material is moved to tailings dams as waste, as was the case at the Merriespruit No. 4 facility. =Method of construction= As is typical with gold tailings in South Africa, the Merriespruit tailing dam was constructed using the \\"upstream semi-dry paddock\\" method, where a \\"daywall\\" perimeter is constructed and allowed to settle and dry out (typically carried out during the day and supervised) before slurry is placed in the \\"nightpan\\" (typically carried out at night without supervision). A penstock is ideally located centrally in the dam and drains water (including stormwater). =History of the dam= Number 4A in the Harmony Gold Mine tailings complex failed. The dam was designed in the early seventies by the mine's metallurgical manager and a representative from the tailings dam contractor. The town of Merriespruit, a 250-house suburb of the Goldfields town of Virginia, was already established when the No. 4 dam was started in 1978. The northern wall of the dam was only 320 m from the nearest houses in Merriespruit. In the early years the slurry had a low relative density that led to difficult construction conditions with seepage and sloughing on the northern wall. A drained tailings buttress was constructed against the face of the northern wall. A single ringmain around the dam was not used, contrary to current practice. A return water dam that could accept water from the dam itself was not provided. In March 1993 an inspection noticed seepage on the north wall and it was agreed to stop deposition into compartment 4A. According to the contractor the freeboard at this time was an acceptable 1.0+ m. The division of compartments 4A and 4B was breached some time before the disaster, resulting in drainage from 4B to 4A. The extra drainage led to a freeboard of 300 mm. Despite the termination of daywall construction, deposition of excess plant water containing tailings continued, with the water decanted by the penstock and the remaining tailings using up the remaining freeboard. Piezometers were installed and the water table established; the contractor calculated the stability factor of safety to be 1.34 The No 4 dam was in an unacceptable condition prior to failure. Contrary to legislative requirements, at the time of failure the dam did not have the capacity to maintain a 0.5-m freeboard during a one-in-100-year 24-hour storm. Satellite imagery showed that water was ponded against the northern wall in February 1994. Eyewitness accounts An eyewitness reported a strong stream of water entering the town downstream of the dam at 7:00 pm on the evening of the disaster, which was not the first time such a phenomenon had occurred. One person reported seeing water flowing over the top of the dam wall. When the mining company and contractor arrived at the site that evening, one of the contractor's employees found water lapping the top penstock ring; he then removed rings from the two penstock outlets. Another employee saw blocks of tailings toppling from the tailings buttress. Before they could warn the inhabitants of the town they heard a loud bang and a wave of tailings and water flooded the town. Inquiry Stava Valley disaster, in Tesero (Italy); the text translates as: \\"The survivors of the Stava Valley comemorate with bitterness and emotion the victims of the collapse of the Harmony tailing dam, which on 22nd February 1994 crushed the quarter of Merriespruit in the city of Virginia in South Africa, and they renew the admonishment that never again the works of the man become cause of death and destruction\\" Separate investigations were carried out by the owner, operator, and the State. A joint inquest/inquiry was run, with a judge appointed by the Minister of Justice. The State conducted investigations including looking at eyewitness accounts, weather and hydrological data, laboratory and in situ tailings testing, satellite imagery, and overtopping studies using a scale model. The mine and the contractor managing the tailings were found responsible for the disaster. The inquiry led to the introduction of a new Code of Practice for Mine Residue Deposits.Strydom, 1999 The judge described the dam as a time bomb waiting to explode. The owner, operator and six of their employees were found guilty of negligence and heavy fines were imposed. It was discovered that economic pressure had led to a reduction in personnel related to the tailings dam, the metallurgical manager's direct management of the dam was reduced due to time constraints, and personnel had been promoted to positions for which they did not have adequate experience. The South African government appointed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate, which confirmed the conclusions reached; as a result the 1995 Draft Code of Practice for the Design, Operation, and Closure of Tailings Dams was introduced. Consequences Public awareness of the threat of tailings dams led to community pressure preventing an application for expansion for a tailings dam within 1 km of houses in Fleurhof in 1992. The operator, who is also responsible for the majority of tailings dams in South Africa, appointed qualified staff and implemented a hazard-management strategy for every tailings dam.

History The former Carn Thomas Secondary School site, St Mary's The secondary school and four primary schools were formerly five separate schools. While the smaller schools were praised by inspectors, the two larger schools on St Mary's were judged as inadequate. In response, the government forced a fresh start as a federated school, which opened in April 2002 and subsequently the other off islands bases were also federated. An inspection in June and July 2003 again found the standard of education at the St Mary's sites to be inadequate, and the school was placed in special measures until 2005. Under a succession of heads, the school had become a successful and cohesive federation, judged \\"outstanding\\" by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) in 2007., Office for Standards in Education. In 2008, the school was given funding of £13 million to build a new 3–16 school complex on a site adjacent to the existing Carn Gwaval primary school. This development took place 2010–11 and opened in time for the 2011–12 school year, which resulted in the secondary school moving permanently away from the Carn Thomas site, as well as the primary pupils at Carn Gwaval also moving into the new neighbouring school complex. The former primary school building was modernised and extended, becoming the island's main indoor sports and fitness centre. Sites Tresco and Bryher School, Tresco St Agnes School Secondary education (up to GCSE) is provided only on the most populous island of St Mary's. There, it was based at the Carn Thomas site, on the eastern edge of Hugh Town, on the road to Porth Mellon, but in 2011 relocated to a new school complex at Carn Gwaval, adjacent to an existing primary base there, between Hugh Town and Old Town. Secondary pupils from the other islands are given free board at Mundesley Hostel during the school week, returning home at the weekends and holidays. The four primary education bases are at Carn Gwaval, near Old Town — for St Mary's pupils; on Tresco, near Old Grimsby — for pupils from that island and the neighbouring island of Bryher; on St Martin's; and on St Agnes. The Carn Gwaval base has been combined since 2011 with the sole secondary education base. the main campus had 117 secondary and 111 primary pupils, and the Tresco, St Agnes, and St Martin's bases had 24, 7, and 6 students, respectively.\\"Education.\\" Council of the Isles of Scilly. 24 July 2003.

He spent several years in China's Fujian and Guangxi province after being captured by the Chinese authorities in an anti-smuggling operation. The report he wrote after escaping China is one of the earliest known accounts by a westerner of life in the Ming China; indeed, it is the first detailed observation of that civilisation by a lay (non-clerical) European visitor since that of Marco Polo. Biography Pereira and other Portuguese mercenaries helped defend the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom against the invading army of King Tabinshwehti of Pegu in the Burmese–Siamese War (1548–49), introducing Early Modern warfare to the region. Pereira engaged in smuggling along the Ming Empire's South China Sea coast, for which enterprise one notorious centre was the Taishan islet of Wuyu in Xiamen Bay. He was aboard one of the two Portuguese junks seized in March 1549 near the Dongshan Peninsula during the Pirate Extermination Campaign of the Jiajing Emperor, which was actively carried out by Fujian's grand coordinator Zhu Wan. Luckily not among the crew members executed extrajudicially, Pereira and others were incarcerated at Fuzhou. During and subsequent to his trial, the detainees were taken out \\"many times ... and were brought to the palaces of noblemen to be seen of them and their wives,\\" which allowed Pereira to see something of Fuzhou. Fortunately for Pereira and other surviving Portuguese (and their companions, coming from various parts of the Portuguese colonial empire in Asia), Zhu Wan's enemy at the imperial court learned of the irregularities involved in the execution of the prisoners and the handling of captured merchandise; censors arrived from Beijing, a number of officials were removed from their positions and punished; Zhu Wan himself committed suicide. The Portuguese prisoners waiting for the end of their lives in Fuzhou's prison were dispatched to live out their sentences of separate internal exile, in various locations around Guilin, Guizhou. With the help of the Portuguese merchants in Canton, many of the exiles managed to make their way by bribe and stealth back to the sea coast and to Portuguese ships and off-shore bases. Pereira was one of these escapees. It is known that in mid-February 1553 he was already in the Shangchuan Island, assisting at the exhumation of the incorrupt remains of Francis Xavier. Pereira's story Several of the Portuguese survivors of the 1549 incident and the subsequent imprisonment and exile wrote accounts of their experiences. The first of them was published as early as 1555. However, Galeote Pereira's is considered the most complete, and is the best known. It is not known when Pereira first wrote his account. While C. R. Boxer surmised that Pereira may have penned his recollections soon after his escape to safety, the earliest known manuscript of his notes dates to 1561. It is a copy made by Indian pupils of the Jesuit Saint Paul's College in Goa, and sent to one of the Jesuits' central offices in Europe. While the original Portuguese text, entitled \\"Algũas cousas sabidas da China ...\\" (\\"Some things known about China ...\\") was not published at the time, its (slightly abridged) Italian translation appeared in Venice in 1565 in a book containing a number of other reports sent by Jesuits from India. An English translation of that Italian text, made by a former English Jesuit Richard Willis was printed in 1577, in the History of Travayle in the West and East Indies, under the title \\"Certain reports of the province China, learned through the Portugals there imprisoned, and chiefly by the relation of Galeote Pereira, a gentleman of good credit, that lay prisoner in that country many years. Done out of Italian by R.W.\\". Willis' translation was reprinted a number of times. A complete English translation of the original (i.e., the earliest known to us) Portuguese manuscript was made by Boxer and published in 1953 in Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu, vol. XXII, pp. 63–92.The translation is reproduced on pp. 3-43 in The original Portuguese text has since been published in Portugal,See bibliographic information in http://tesisenred.net/bitstream/handle/10803/4951/fmpnro4de4.pdf?sequence=4 and in vol. 153 of Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu in Rome.\\"Some thing about China, known in all truth by the Portuguese who had been prisoners there, taken from a treatise written by Galiote Pereira, a gentleman who had been a prisoner there for some years and in truth saw all this happen, and which [thus] has much authority\\", document 81 in Published accounts of other Portuguese prisoners captured together with Pereira include the letter of Afonso Ramiro, sent from Wuzhou to the Portuguese base at Langbaijiao in 1555.\\"Afonso Ramiro, prisoner, to the Portuguese on Langbaijiao\\". Document 48 in =Content of the report= The restored Quanshan Gate of Quanzhou. Pereira and his fellow prisoners may have been carried through (an earlier incarnation of) this gate on their way to Fuzhou. The organization of Pereira's account is somewhat chaotic: it is neither a strictly chronological account describing a chain of events (a \\"travelogue\\" or \\"memoir\\"), nor a treatise describing various aspects of China in some logical order (as later book-size works by Gaspar da Cruz, Bernardino de Escalante or Juan González de Mendoza would be). Instead, both aspects are present to some extent. Pereira's manuscript starts in the style of a geographical overview. Like most later geographical works on China, he starts with listing China's provinces (\\"shires\\", in Willis' translation), stating that there are 13 of them, giving names of 11 of them and a brief information about some, and concluding that for \\"Confu\\", Yunnan and Sichuan, \\"how many towns [those] three shires have, we are ignorant as yet, as also of the proper names of the twelfth and thirteenth shires, and the towns therein\\".. Boxer notes that he is unable to identify Galeote's \\"Confu\\". This shows that Pereira (or his early Jesuit editors) were not in possession of the information that the Lisbon historian João de Barros had when writing the Third of his Décadas da Ásia (published 1563, but written much earlier), which correctly lists all fifteen provinces of the Ming China. He then proceeds with a brief description of Chinese cities whose \\"streets are wonderful to behold\\" and which are decorated with numerous \\"arches of triumph\\",; Pereira gives the example of \\"Chincheo\\", which Boxer thinks refers here to Quanzhou, although in other works of the period it also referred to the nearby Zhangzhou and of the densely populated and intensively farmed countryside. He is impressed with well-paved roads and the bridges of Fujian's coastal road, built using huge stones. Pereira is surprised that the word \\"China\\", which the Portuguese had learned in Southern and Southeastern Asia, is not known in China itself, and is curious how Chinese people call their country and themselves. He gets the answer that \\"the whole country is called Tamen\\" (i.e., Da Ming), and its people, Tamenjins (i.e., Da Ming ren, 大明人, \\"people of the Great Ming\\"). Interspersed with geographical details and references to his personal experience is a fair amount of information about the country's administration, the titles and roles of various government officials., and elsewhere throughout the entire report. =Description of the Ming law-enforcement system= Due to the peculiar circumstances of Pereira's stay in China, it is not surprising that a significant portion of Galeote Pereira's account deals with the \\"inner side\\" of the Ming courts and prisons. He described harsh conditions inside the prisons of the time, as well as the practice of corporal punishment: > Their whips be bamboos, cleft in the middle, in such sort that they seem > rather plain than sharp. He that is to be whipped lieth groveling on the > ground. Upon his thighs the hangman layeth on blows mightily with these > bamboos, that the standers-by tremble at their cruelty. Ten stripes draws a > great deal of blood, twenty or thirty spoil the flesh altogether, fifty or > threescore will require a long time to be healed, and if they come to the > number of one hundred, then they are incurable—and they are given to > whosoever hath nothing wherewith to bribe these executioners who administer > them.Jonathan Spence, The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds, > New York: 1999, W. W. Norton & Company, , p. 21. Despite the severity of its punishments, Pereira extols the impartiality of the Ming judicial system. The malign accusations of two local worthies, apparently their erstwhile partners, were not enough to see the Portuguese smugglers scapegoated : > For wheresoever in any town of Christendom should be accused unknown men as > we were, I know not what end the very Innocents' cause would have; but we in > a heathen country, having for our enemies two of the chiefest men in a whole > town, wanting an interpreter, ignorant of that country's language, did in > the end see our great adversaries cast into prison for our sake, and > deprived of their offices and honour for not doing justice—yea, not to > escape death, for as rumour goeth, they shall be beheaded. Now see if [the > Ming] do justice or no.Spence (1999), p. 23. =Religion= Even in proportion to its (shorter) length, Pereira's work dwells less on religious issues than do the later books of professional Christian missionaries (such as Gaspar da Cruz, Martín de Rada or Matteo Ricci); nonetheless, he still gives a brief account of the religious practices of both Han and Hui people. He notes that people refer to the supreme divine power as \\"Heaven\\", explaining that \\"as we are wont to say 'God knoweth it', so say they at every word Tien xautee,; note that the use of the letter x in Pinyin is nothing new! that is to say 'The heavens do know it'\\". He did realize at least that there are several types of temples, and the divinity worshiped in some of them is referred to as Omithofom (Āmítuó Fó) Pereira deems the Fujian Muslims to be almost entirely assimilated into the Chinese mainstream. According to him, they \\"knew so little of their sect, that they could say nothing else but that 'Mahomet was a Moor, my father was a Moor, and I am a Moor', with some other words of their Alcoran, wherewithal and in abstinence from swine's flesh, they live until the devil take them all\\". (\\"Moors\\" () was at the time a common way for the Portuguese to refer to any Muslims). He says that there were over 200 Muslims in a Guangxi city he visited (not quite clear whether he is talking of Wuzhou or Guilin), all attending the Friday prayers in their mosques. He thinks, however, \\"that will no longer endure\\", because while the older generation is still observant and remembers of its old homeland in Çamarquão (Samarkand), \\"their posterity is so confused, that they have nothing of a Moor in them but abstinence from swine's flesh, and yet many of them do eat thereof privately\\". =Language= Several references to (Chinese) interpreters, or problems arising in their absence, indicate that few if any Portuguese prisoners spoke much Chinese, at least in the beginning. There is no explicit information on how much Chinese Pereira learned even by the end of his enforced stay in the country. =Other notable elements of Pereira's account= Like Gaspar da Cruz a few years later, Pereira is dismayed at the prevalence and common acceptance of homosexual liaisons: > The greatest fault we do find in them is sodomy, a vice very common in the > meanest sort, and nothing strange among the best. Marco Polo, too, had found the practice quite as prevalent and accepted under the Mongol-ruled Yuan. But too like Polo, Pereira has some surprising lacunae: he makes not one reference to the widespread, customary practice of foot binding (six hundred years old in his time, three in Polo's). Nor does he mention the use of the herb Camellia sinensis (tea), nor the unique character of the Empire's writing system nor to its marvelous facilities for the printing thereof. =Influence of Pereira's account= According to Boxer's estimate, about one-third of Galeote Pereira's account was later incorporated in Gaspar da Cruz's A Treatise of China, the first China-specific book published in Europe (1569). Via that book, or Bernardino de Escalante's work largely derivative of da Cruz, much of the information conveyed by Pereira got into Juan González de Mendoza's History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof (1585), which was to become Europe's most authoritative book on China for the following three decades. Fernão Mendes Pinto's Peregrinação (\\"Pilgrimage\\", 1614) depends heavily on Pereira at several points. Legacy The 2005 English-language Thai film The King Maker shows a character similar to Galeote Pereira. Although the character is named Fernando De Gama he is known as a Portuguese soldier of fortune helping to defend the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom where the film is based.

Built in 1887, it became a cinema in 1910 before being demolished in 1923. History The theatre was built in 1887, near Fountain's Court, on the site of a former public house, the Old Coal Hole, and was designed by Walter Emden for the publican, Charles Wilmot and a Dr Web. The theatre was built to accommodate 800, seated in pit and stalls, balcony and a dress circle. Fountain's Court was named for 'Fountain's Tavern', where the Fountain Club met - formed by Robert Walpole's political opponents. In 1826, Edmund Kean, the actor, founded a late supper club here, known as the 'Wolf Club' for carousing. It ran until the 1850s, introducing entertainments similar to Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms, in nearby Covent Garden.The clubs are marked by historic plaques on the modern Coal Hole public house. Edward Terry, as owner-manager, opened the theatre on 17 October 1887, with the farce The Churchwarden, followed by The Woman Hater. Terry had been the leading comedian of the Royal Strand Theatre and then starred in John Hollingshead's company at the Gaiety before entering theatre management. He achieved considerable success with his own production of Arthur Wing Pinero's Sweet Lavender, which opened at Terry's Theatre on 21 March 1888 and ran for 683 performances, producing a £20,000 profit.

They were originally housed at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and are now in the cathedral treasury of Notre-Dame de Paris. History =Medieval and early modern= Saint Louis (King Louis IX) built Sainte-Chapelle in the 13th century to house the Holy Crown, a fragment of the True Cross and other relics he had acquired from Baldwin II of Constantinople. This made the chapel itself an immense reliquary, housing the crown, the True Cross fragment, relics of the Virgin Mary, the Holy Lance, the Holy Sponge and the Mandylion, a supposed image of Christ. Jannic Durand, \\"Les reliques de Constantinople\\", in Dossier d'archéologie, Faton, vol. 264 « La Sainte Chapelle », juin 2001, p. 60-65 (ISSN 1141-7137) In the early modern era the kings of France drained their treasury, sold rubies and melted down gold to supply their vast military spending needs, making all the chapel's ecclesiastical treasures into a monetary reserve that could be used if needed, as they had also been in the medieval era. This meant that under Henry IV of France (reigned 1589–1610) what was left of the treasure was reduced to the state it would retain until the French Revolution. =Revolution to present= The Revolution meant a ban on conserving relics and all other sacred symbols linked to the kings, though this allowed for pieces judged to be of high artistic quality to be saved. These relics were handed over to the archbishop of Paris in 1804 and are still held in the cathedral treasury of Notre Dame, cared for by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and the cathedral chapter. The first Friday of every month at 3 PM, guarded by the Knights, the Holy Relics are exposed for veneration and adoration by the faithful before the cathedral's high altar.Notre-Dame de Paris: Veneration of the Crown of Thorns Every Good Friday, this adoration lasts all day, punctuated by the liturgical offices. An exhibition entitled Le trésor de la Sainte-Chapelle was installed at the Louvre in 2001. After the April 2019 fire at Notre-Dame, the relics were moved for safekeeping first to the Paris city hall overnight, and then to the Louvre.  Notes and references   Bibliography  *Durand, Jannic.

The individual layers consist of high-modulus, high- strength fibers in a polymeric, metallic, or ceramic matrix material. Typical fibers used include cellulose, graphite, glass, boron, and silicon carbide, and some matrix materials are epoxies, polyimides, aluminium, titanium, and alumina. Layers of different materials may be used, resulting in a hybrid laminate. The individual layers generally are orthotropic (that is, with principal properties in orthogonal directions) or transversely isotropic (with isotropic properties in the transverse plane) with the laminate then exhibiting anisotropic (with variable direction of principal properties), orthotropic, or quasi-isotropic properties. Quasi-isotropic laminates exhibit isotropic (that is, independent of direction) inplane response but are not restricted to isotropic out-of-plane (bending) response. Depending upon the stacking sequence of the individual layers, the laminate may exhibit coupling between inplane and out-of-plane response. An example of bending-stretching coupling is the presence of curvature developing as a result of in-plane loading. Classical laminate analysis Composite laminates may be regarded as a type of plate or thin-shell structure, and as such their stiffness properties may be found by integration of in-plane stress in the direction normal to the laminates surface. The broad majority of ply or lamina materials obey Hooke's law and hence all of their stresses and strains may be related by a system of linear equations. Laminates are assumed to deform by developing three strains of the mid-plane/surface and three changes in curvature \\\\varepsilon ^0 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\varepsilon^0_x & \\\\varepsilon^0_y & \\\\tau^0_{xy} \\\\end{bmatrix}^T and \\\\kappa = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\kappa_x & \\\\kappa_y & \\\\kappa_{xy} \\\\end{bmatrix} ^T where x and y define the co-ordinate system at the laminate level. Individual plies have local co-ordinate axes which are aligned with the materials characteristic directions; such as the principal directions of its elasticity tensor. Uni-directional ply's for example always have their first axis aligned with the direction of the reinforcement. A laminate is a stack of individual plies having a set of ply orientations \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\theta_1, & \\\\theta_2, & \\\\dots & \\\\theta_N \\\\end{bmatrix} which have a strong influence on both the stiffness and strength of the laminate as a whole. Rotating an anisotropic material results in a variation of its elasticity tensor. If in its local co-ordinates a ply is assumed to behave according to the stress-strain law [\\\\sigma] = \\\\mathbf{Q}[\\\\varepsilon] then under a rotation transformation (see transformation matrix) it has the modified elasticity terms Q^*_{11} = Q_{11}\\\\cos^4\\\\theta + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\cos^2\\\\theta + Q_{22}\\\\sin^4 \\\\theta Q^*_{22} = Q_{11}\\\\sin^4\\\\theta + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})\\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\cos^2\\\\theta + Q_{22}\\\\cos^4 \\\\theta Q^*_{12} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 4 Q_{66})\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta + Q_{12}(\\\\sin^4 \\\\theta + \\\\cos^4 \\\\theta) Q^*_{66} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 2 Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta + Q_{66}(\\\\sin^4 \\\\theta + \\\\cos^4 \\\\theta) Q^*_{16} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\\\\cos^3\\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\theta - (Q_{22}-Q_{12}-2Q_{66})\\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin^3 \\\\theta Q^*_{26} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2 Q_{66})\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\sin^3 \\\\theta - (Q_{22}-Q_{12}-2Q_{66})\\\\cos^3 \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\theta Hence [\\\\sigma]^* = \\\\mathbf{Q}^*[\\\\varepsilon]^* An important assumption in the theory of classical laminate analysis is that the strains resulting from curvature vary linearly in the thickness direction, and that the total in-plane strains are a sum of those derived from membrane loads and bending loads. Hence \\\\varepsilon = \\\\varepsilon^0 + \\\\kappa \\\\cdot z Furthermore, a three-dimensional stress field is replaced by six stress resultants; three membrane forces (forces per unit length) and bending moments per unit length. It is assumed that if these three quantities are known at any location (x,y) then the stresses may be computed from them. Once part of a laminate the transformed elasticity is treated as a piecewise function of the thickness direction, hence the integration operation may be treated as the sum of a finite series, givingGürdal et al.

The college was created in 2016 through the merger of the All Saints Catholic Boys' College and the All Saints Catholic Girls College and provides religious and general education for students in Year 7 to Year 10. The boys' school was originally called Patrician Brothers College, Liverpool. One of the feeder schools in the All Saints Catholic Primary School, located adjacent to the College. Some students progress to the All Saints Catholic Senior College, located in the adjacent suburb of . The majority of the population of the college come from non- English-speaking backgrounds. The college caters for students in the parishes of Liverpool, Moorebank, Holsworthy and Lurnea. The school was founded by Brother Ignatius Barrett in 1954. History The college was founded in 1954 by Brother Ignatius Barrett as Patrician Brothers College, Liverpool. The school originally taught out of a partition-type shelter until the first buildings were constructed in 1955. The college continued to expand well into the 1970s. Upgrades to the administration and staff areas also took place in the 1990s. The name was officially changed to All Saints Catholic College in 1997. The logo, school colours and uniforms were changed as a result. In 2010, a new science block, funded by the Federal Government's Building Education Revolution Programme, was completed. Prior to its 2016 merger, the college comprised two single-sex colleges, running from years 7 through 10. School structure and The Newman Program Classes are structured into 5 periods, which last for one hour. These are broken every two hours by recess and lunch, which last 30 minutes. On Thursdays, classes are structured as 3 periods broken by recess and lunch, which is then followed by sports. The college ends 30 minutes earlier on Thursdays, compared to the rest of the week. Half of the subjects at the college are single-sex (core subjects). Core subjects include Mathematics, H.S.I.E, Science and English for years 7–8. Along with P.D.H.P.E also being added as a single-sex class in years 9-10 for students. Apart from single-sex classes, several elective and compulsive classes are taught co- educational with both genders learning together. However, All Saints Catholic College also supports the Newman Gifted Education program for years 7-10. Students hoping to be in the Newman program undertake a selective exam in year 6. Students can also join the Newman program later on from years 8–10 with outstanding grades. The Newman class is co-educational, meaning students in the Newman classes do not have any single-sex classes through high-school, different from other students. Students in the Newman program are also included in a variety of special projects throughout the year such as The Newman Symposium. All teachers must complete a gifted education course before teaching the Newman class. Students in the Newman class are taught differently from other classes in order to fully reach the capabilities of gifted students. A spot in the Newman class is highly sought after for students and students should maintain high grades to secure their spot in the class. Newman Selective schools provide high-quality professional learning for staff and an authentically rigorous program for gifted learners within a nurturing Catholic environment, thus enhancing the whole-person. They offer a wide range of opportunities that cater to a variety of gifted learners and supports students’ social and emotional wellbeing. The playground and all other areas of the school are shared by both female and male students with a Charity side, focusing on more passive activities during break times and a Patrician side, focusing on more active activities. The Charity side is known for being more popular to the Year Seven students, with many younger students spending their time on the Charity side. The Patrician side is well known for being the \\"sporty\\" area with many different options for students to exercise and play sports during break times. The Patrician Side is more popular to Year 8 students, with year 9 and Year 10 students preferring to spend break times at the various courtyards and seating areas. College pastoral houses Delany House Daniel Delany was born in Ireland, at a time when England was oppressing the Catholic Church. Education had been banned for Catholics for 200 years. At the age of 14, Daniel's family sent him to France for an education. He came back to a priest and later became a bishop. Daniel was a man of prayer and action. He ran public processions of faith and worship when it was still illegal under British Law. Poverty and hunger had turned the country into a land of misery and lawlessness. Bishop Delany could see the only way to liberate the people was through education. He got permission to start schools so he established the Patrician Brothers a teaching order. He also established the Sisters of St. Brigid and supported both congregations until he died. Patrick House It is believed that Saint Patrick was born in Britain of Roman parents. At the age of sixteen, he was captured and taken to Ireland as a slave. He spent six years as a herdsman getting to know the language and way of life of his captors. During the many quiet times alone he came to a deep knowledge of God. He escaped from Ireland, became a priest, then was consecrated a bishop. In 432 he returned to Ireland, where, filled with the Holy Spirit, he converted many Irish kings and their people. St. Patrick had a deeply spiritual and personal relationship with God, which allowed him to see Christ in all people as expressed in 'The Breastplate'. The Patrician Brothers derive their name from this saint as they were established as 'The Brothers of St. Patrick'. Marian House Mary was a first-century BC Galilean Jewish woman of Nazareth, and the mother of Jesus, according to the New Testament and the Quran. The gospels of Matthew and Luke in the New Testament and the Quran describe Mary as a virgin; according to Christian theology she conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit while still a virgin. The miraculous conception took place when she was already betrothed to Joseph. She accompanied Joseph to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. Mary has been venerated since early Christianity and is considered by millions to be the most meritorious saint of the religion. She is said to have miraculously appeared to believers many times over the centuries. The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches believe that Mary, as the mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God. There is significant diversity in the Marian beliefs and devotional practices of major Christian traditions. Aikenhead House Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead (19 January 1787 – 22 July 1858) was born in Daunt's Square off Grand Parade, Cork, Ireland. She was the founder of the Catholic religious institute, the Religious Sisters of Charity, the Sisters of Charity of Australia, and of St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin. She was active in works of charity but she had failed to find a religious institute devoted to charitable work. She shared this idea with Archbishop Murray, Bishop Coadjutor of Dublin who was a friend of O'Brien. Murray returned later and said that he would bring a French order to Ireland if Aikenhead would lead it.[6] To prepare for this task she became a novice from 1812 to 1815 in the Convent of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin at Micklegate Bar, York.[5] She there assumed the name she kept till death, Sister Mary Augustine. \` On 1 September 1815, the first members of the new institute took their vows, Sister Mary Augustine being appointed Superior-General. Added to the traditional three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, was a fourth vow: to devote their lives to the service of the poor. The following sixteen years were filled with the arduous work of organizing the community and extending its sphere of labour to every phase of charity, chiefly hospital and rescue work. She died in Dublin, aged 71, having left her institute in a flourishing condition, in charge of ten institutions, besides innumerable missions and branches of charitable work. She is interred in the cemetery attached to St. Mary Magdalen's, Donnybrook. Therry House John Therry was born in Cork and was privately educated at St Patrick's College in Carlow. In 1815 he was ordained as a priest. He did parish work in Dublin and later on was the secretary to the Bishop of Cork. He had heard that Catholic convicts in Australia were without a priest to minister to them, and let it be known that he would be willing to go there as a missionary. On 5 December 1819, he sailed on the Janus with another priest, the Rev. P. Conolly, as a companion. They arrived at Sydney on 3 May 1820. Unlike Father O'Flynn, who had previously arrived without government sanction and had been deported, the two priests were accredited chaplains with a salary from the government of £1000 a year each. The two men were of different temperaments and found it difficult to agree, and in 1821 Conolly went to Tasmania and remained there until his death in 1839. Therry set about his work with great enthusiasm. His chief anxiety was the need of a church, and in view of the increase in the population of Sydney in future years, it was decided that it should be on a large scale. Almost by chance the site on which St Mary's Cathedral now stands was granted by the government, subscriptions were given by generous people, including many non- Catholics, and by 1823 it had been agreed that if a fresh subscription were opened the government would give a sum \\"equal to the sum total of all such additional donations\\". Governor Macquarie had laid the foundation-stone on 29 October 1821. Governor Thomas Brisbane, who succeeded Macquarie, was tolerant and helpful, but when Governor Darling arrived in December 1825 a period of anxiety for Therry and his church set in. Sports The college takes part in the Metropolitan Catholic Schools competition (MCS) for male students, with the college taking place in Sydney Catholic Colleges Sports Association for girls representative Sport (SCC). Several colleges take part in this competition including Patrician Brothers, Fairfield and Blacktown and Holy Cross Ryde. All Saints students also participate in recreational sports such as ice skating, indoor rock climbing, ten-pin bowling, laser tag, golf, squash, tennis, table tennis, indoor soccer, indoor cricket, and indoor basketball, which are both in-school and out-of-school sports Recent developments Recently the college undertook a refurbishment program to improve the school's facilities. This refurbishment was completed in 2014, which included general learning areas, TAS facilities, gym, library, synthetic surfaced turfed area, performing arts centre, and maths activity centre. New redevelopments, including a new administration block, staff study, and cafeteria are also planned.

The purpose of the organization is largely social and honorific. The current honor society meets once a year at a black-tie dinner to induct new members. History Kappa Beta Phi lore, as told to initiates of the 1950s, was that it was the second oldest campus or Greek-letter fraternity following Phi Beta Kappa, founded earlier in 1776. It was established as an alternative to Phi Beta Kappa to allow young men to meet and share ideas in an atmosphere of pub conviviality rather than more formal and elitist salon discussions; its reversed Greek letters were purportedly chosen to reinforce the contrast. A chapter at Minnesota is pictured, with a chapter list, in the 1894 Minnesota Gopher yearbook, adjacent to the Phi Beta Kappa page. The Gopher of 1894 This reference includes an etching of the pin, slightly different from the graphic shown here, and explains it was founded at Trinity College of England. A membership card of the University of Michigan Chapter of Kappa Beta Phi for the 1952-53 college year supports the club's founding date by featuring the phrase \\"Founded 1776.\\" An image of the Kappa Beta Phi key of that era is printed as background on the membership card and shows in the lower left corner a hand pointing at a stein in the upper right corner, three stars in the upper left corner, and a blank lower right corner. Membership was by invitation and open only to men belonging to one of five Greek-letter social fraternities, including Psi Upsilon. The Michigan chapter's purpose was entirely social and revolved around several parties and picnics per year at which alcoholic drinks were always available. An all-day initiation was held once a year in a secluded farm field and involved excessive drinking. By the 1930s dozens of chapters were in existence, primarily on college campuses. The society was known for being made up of men with a sense of humor. Many colleges and traditional fraternities fought to abolish Kappa Beta Phi, as it was often characterized as a fraternity solely for drinking and partying while making a mockery of academics and more reputable organizations such as Phi Beta Kappa. The Wall Street Chapter of Kappa Beta Phi was founded in 1929 prior to the stock market crash, and is the only remaining chapter of the society. The stated purpose of the Wall Street Chapter is to \\"keep alive the spirit of the 'good old days of 1928–29.'\\"\\"Hobart College: Kappa Beta Phi Men May Pay a Visit to Lehigh\\". New York Times. December 8, 1912. pSM19\\"Kappa Beta Phi Dinner: Wall street Chapter to Revive Ghosts of \\"Good Old Days\\" Tonight\\". The Wall Street Journal. June 14, 1932 Traditions The organization's name is a reversal of Phi Beta Kappa, and instead of a key, the members wear a fob tied to a red ribbon around their necks. The organization's officers bear odd titles such as Grand Swipe (the president), Grand Smudge, Grand Loaf and Master at Arms. The annual dinner has been described by The Wall Street Journal as \\"Part Friar's Club roast, part 'Gong Show.'\\" New inductees are expected to perform in a variety show to entertain the members, and many inductees benefit from professional coaches and writers to prepare them for their performances. Backed by a five-piece band, the inductees performed renditions of well-known tunes with lyrics modified to satirize Wall Street. Insignia Kappa Beta Phi's insignia consists of a beer stein, a Champagne glass, a pointing hand, and five stars. The group’s Latin motto, \\"Dum vivamus edimus et biberimus,\\" roughly translates as \\"While we live, we eat and drink\\". Members of the Wall Street Chapter About 15 to 20 new members are inducted each year. Historically, the organization has inducted top executives of various Wall Street firms, including: *Michael Bloomberg – former New York City mayor *James Cayne – former CEO of Bear Stearns *Jon Corzine – former New Jersey Governor *Nigel MacEwan - former CEO of Kleinwort Benson North America, former president of Merrill Lynch *Laurence D.

He is known to have lived in Amroha, India. Raskhan was his takhallus in Hindi. In his early years, he became a follower of Lord Krishna and learned the bhakti marga from Goswami Vitthalnath and began living in Brindavan and spent his whole life there. He accepted Lord Krishna as the Supreme God and became a Vaishnav. He died in 1628 A.D. His samadhi is at Mahaban which is situated about six miles east of Mathura.Tomb of Great Poet of India, Raskhan at Mahaban in Mathura Distt. IndiaTomb History Scholars disagree about his year of birth. Estimates include 1614 and 1630, while Mishra Bandhu believes that Raskhan was born in 1558 and died in 1628. Most of the scholars say Raskhan was a Pashtun Sardar and his birthplace was Kabul, Afghanistan. Hazari Prasad Dwivedi claims in his book Raskhan was born Syed Ibrahim, and that Khan was his title. Raskhan was the son of a jagirdar (rich landowner)and lived in luxury in his youth. He received a good education. Raskhan spoke both Hindi and Persian; he translated \\"Bhagavata Purana\\" into Persian. His shrine is located in Gokul near the Yamuna river, Bhramand Ghat. It is a very peaceful place. Many Krishna devotees go there to pay their respects and meditate. According to one story, as contained in the medieval text Bhaktakalpadruma, he once travelled to Brindavan along with his Sufi preceptor. There he fell unconscious and had a vision of Krishna. Thereafter, he remained in Brindavan till he breathed his last.http://www.outlookindia.com/article/ras-khan-a-medieval-krishnaite- sufi/215243 Another version has it that Raskhan fell in love with a very proud woman. Later, when he read the Bhagwat Purana he was so deeply impressed by the unselfish love of the gopis for Krishna that he left his proud mistress and headed straight for Brindavan. There is, however, an even more intriguing story that is contained in some of the hagiographic material about Raskhan. In the Bhavaprakash of the seventeenth century, we are told by Vaishnavite scholar Hari Ray, that Ibrahim Khan earlier lived in Delhi, where he had fallen madly in love with the son of a Hindu merchant. 'He watched him day and night', says Hari Ray, 'and even ate his left-overs'. This angered his fellow Muslims, who branded him as a disbeliever. But Ibrahim Khan, we are told, did not care or relent, answering, very simply, as Hari Ray puts it, 'I am as I am'. One day, the story goes, he overheard one Vaishnavite telling another, 'One should have attachment to the Lord just as this Ibrahim Khan has for the merchant's son. He roves around after him without fear of public slander or caste displeasure!'. The other Vaishnavite turned up his nose in disgust, and when Ibrahim saw this he drew his sword out in anger. Trembling before him, the Vaishnavite said: 'If you loved God just as you do that boy you would find salvation'. Ibrahim's curiosity having been aroused, he began discussing spiritual matters with him. The Vaishnavite advised Ibrahim to travel to Brindavan. When he got there, he was refused entry into the temple on the grounds that he was a Muslim. After sitting on the banks of the lake near the temple having not had anything to eat for three days, Krishna, the story goes, appeared to Ibrahim, addressing him as Raskhan or 'the mine of aesthetic essence', and accepting him as a disciple. From that day onwards, Raskhan began living in Brindavan, composing and singing the Krishnaite Sufi poetry for which he is still so fondly remembered. Subject matter The poetry of Raskhan focuses on Lord Krishna. \\"Lilas\\" of Lord Krishna, such as Bal Lila, Chir Haran Lila, Kunj Lila, Ras Lila, Panghat Lila, and Dan Lila, were his favorite subjects. Apart from Lilas, Raskhan has also created poems on Lord Shankar, Goddess Ganga, and the Holi festival. Poetry Raskhan is widely acknowledged as a great poet, having dedicated most of his creations to Lord. Rachnavali is the collection of Raskhan's poetry. His creations describe the beauty of not only Lord Krishna but also his relations with his beloved Radha. His poetry is in the form of Doha, Padawali and Savayya. Raskhan's Khariboli writings are numerous, the five most important being the Sujana Raskhana, the Premavatika, the Danalila, the Astayama and a collection of Padas (rhymed couplets). Of these the most well-known is the Premavatika (\\"The Forest of Love\\").http://www.outlookindia.com/article/ras-khan-a-medieval-krishnaite- sufi/215243 The Premavatika consists of fifty-three verses, most of which deal with the nature of Divine Love, using the love between Radha and Krishna as a model. Raskhan begins the work, by saying: The dwelling of Love is Shrimati Radhika, the son of Nand [i.e. Krishna] is Love's colour. But the path of Love is not easy, he tells us: Everybody says: \\"Love! Love!\\" but nobody knows Love, he adds, because: If a person knows Love, why would the world weep?. After this, he begins a long monologue about the nature of divine Love thusy: Love is inaccessible, incomparable, immeasurable It is like the ocean - He who comes to its shore will not go back When he drank the wine of Love, Varuna became the Lord of the waters Because he drank poison out of Love, the Lord of the Mountain [Shiva] is worshipped. When the traveller on the mystical path begins to understand the nature of true love, then external rituals and bonds begin to lose their meaning for him. Thus, says Raskhan: The rules of the world, the Veda and the world, shame, work and doubt All these you give up once you practise love For what are regulations and negations when compared to Love? 'Without Love everything is useless', Raskhan notes, and then adds: Of Shruti, Puranas, Agamas and Smritis, Love is the essence of all. Without the knowledge of Love there is no experience of Ananda [bliss] Knowledge, action, and worship, all of these are the root of pride Reading the Shastras, you become a Pandit, reciting the Quran, a Maulvi But if you have not known Love in that, what is the use, asks Raskhan?\\" From here Raskhan starts an intricate description of the path of Love and surrender to God, in the process questioning all orthodoxies, all formalisms and all man-made divisions. This is in a sense the essence of his message. He ends his work with the following lines: Tearing his heart away from a haughty woman [i.e. the snares of the world] Miyam [himself] has become Raskhan once he saw the beauty of Premadeva [The God of Love].http://www.outlookindia.com/article/ras-khan-a-medieval- krishnaite-sufi/215243 References * Raskhan - The Great Hindi Poet External links * Raskhan - At Kavita Kosh (Hindi) * Sujan Raskhan (Hindi) * Prem Vatika Raskhan Couplets (Hindi) Indian male poets Converts to Hinduism from Islam 17th-century Indian poets Hindi-language poets People from Kabul People from Mathura district Pseudonymous writers Bhakti movement 17th-century male writers ","title":"Raskhan"},{"id":"21118099","text":"George Collins (January 17, 1771 - May 6, 1813) was a mariner, merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia.

After Igor Sikorsky built the successful Sikorsky S-6 for the Russian military, he tried to build another successful aircraft for them. The S-10 was a modified S-6B built by the Russo-Baltic Carriage Factory. Approximately sixteen production versions of the S-10 were built. It had a less powerful engine and generally weaker structure than the S-6. They had either an 80 HP Gnome Monosoupape or a 100 HP Argus Motoren engine. Some were deployed on the world's first operational seaplane carriers. Development Sikorsky built a special S-10 for the 1913 military aircraft competition. This particular S-10 had an 80 HP Gnome engine. The wing span was increased by 150 mm and were fitted with outer panels that could be folded for storage. The two seats were fitted side-by- side, and the yoke could be switched between the pilot and co-pilot during flight. The aircraft also took the first prize in the competition although it lacked the speed and manoeuvrability of the S-6B. Its payload of 48% of the aircraft weight was exceptional. After its wingspan had been reduced by another 3050 mm and the Gnome engine was replaced by a stronger Monosoupape engine, the S-10 served as both a reconnaissance and trainer on floats with the Baltic Fleet.

The name formerly given to him by architectural historians, Peter of Montereau (in French, Pierre de Montereau),Félibien 1725, vol. 5, pp. 229–230. is a misnomer. It was based on his tombstone inscription Musterolo natus (\\"born in Musterolo\\"), a place name that was mistakenly identified as Montereau rather than Montreuil.Prache 1996. His wife Agnes died in 1276 and was buried with him; her epitaph in French reads: \\"Ici gist Agnes fame jadis feu mestre Pierre de Montreuil [Here lies Agnes, in days past wife of deceased master Pierre de Montreuil]\\". Documented work He is one of the first named architects of 13th-century Paris, and, according to Anne Prache (writing in The Dictionary of Art), \\"there has been a tendency to attribute an immense role to him.\\"Prache 1996. Only the rectory (1239–1244, destroyed) and chapel of the Virgin (1245–c. 1250, only fragments remain) of the former abbey of Saint- Germain-des-Prés can be definitely said to be by him.Recorded in his obituary notice in the obituarium of the abbey (Prache 1996). He is thought to have been a master at the Basilique Saint-Denis beginning around 1247,Ayers 2004, p. 289; Prache 1996. Prache reports that Montreuil purchased land and a quarry at Conflans near Paris in 1247, and the document of sale identifies him as cementarius of Saint-Denis. although his specific contributions are unknown, and it is also generally agreed that he completed the south transept of Notre Dame de Paris in the 1260s, after the death of Jean de Chelles.Ayers 2004, p. 82; Prache 1996. Prache reports that in 1265 he sold property in Paris to the Carthusians of Vauvert and is identified as master of works at the cathedral of Notre-Dame. Other attributions Among other attributions, the design of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris was for a long time credited to him, but probably incorrectly,Erlande-Brandenburg 1996. \\"The traditional attribution of the design [of the Sainte-Chapelle] to Pierre de Montreuil can no longer be maintained\\". and alternative authors have been proposed, including Robert de Luzarches and Thomas de Cormont.Ayers 2004, p. 24. The similar Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes has also been attributed to him.Sturgis 1901, vol. 2, column 938. It is not known when it was begun, but its walls had only reached the bases of the windows at the time of Charles V's death in 1380, and its decoration is almost entirely of the 14th century.Ayers 2004, p. 354. The refectory of the Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in Paris (today the library of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers) has also been attributed to Pierre de Montreuil, but without documentation; the window design probably dates to 1230–1240, that is, before Montreuil is believed to have been active.Ayers 2004, p. 75. Many authors have also attributed the Chapelle Saint-Louis (built 1230–1238) at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye to Montreuil.Ayers 2004, p. 316. Status as an architect In 1260 Louis IX hired Montreuil to survey a house that was the subject of a dispute. He was buried in Saint-Germain-des- Prés, in the chapel he had built. His epitaph was engraved on the tomb and gave his title as \\"doctor lathomorum\\" (\\"teacher of masons\\"Carruthers 2010, p. 31. or \\"Doctor of Masons\\"Gimpel 1977, [ p. ]). (This chapel and the refectory of Saint-Germain-des-Prés were demolished in 1794.) Pierre owned a quarry that supplied building materials, and he was well regarded and consulted on building projects as an expert, becoming wealthy and owning several properties.In 1263 he paid taxes on a house in Cachan (Prache 1996). That he and his wife were buried together at a prominent monastery, and he was referred to as a doctor, attests to his standing. Family His family in Montreuil comprised a dynasty of architects. Raoul de Montreuil, who paid the cost of burying Pierre's wife Agnes in 1276, was probably the son of Eudes de Montreuil, who was either the son or brother of Pierre.

The 2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire was an Egyptian-brokered six-month Tahdia (an Arabic term for a lull) \\"for the Gaza area\\", which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008. According to the Egyptian-brokered agreement, Israel promised to stop air strikes and other attacks, while in return, there would not be rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza. Once the ceasefire held, Israel was to gradually begin to ease its blockade of Gaza. During the initial week of the ceasefire, Islamic Jihad militants fired rockets on Israel. Under pressure from Hamas, Islamic Jihad had agreed to abide by the temporary truce, which was meant to apply only to Gaza, but had balked at the idea of not responding to Israeli military actions in the West Bank. The New York Times reported that the Islamic Jihad action broke the Hamas-Israeli Gaza truce. During the next 5 months of the ceasefire, Gazan attacks decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings, compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%. The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and \\"allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza\\" within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire. The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels. Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions, preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores. Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza's economy \\"on the brink of collapse\\". On 4 November 2008, Israel raided Gaza, killing six Hamas militants. The Israeli military said the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away. Hamas officials said that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes. Following the Israeli raid, Hamas launched barrage of rocket fire at targets in southern Israel. On 20 December, Hamas announced it would not renew the ceasefire. Israel commenced Operation Cast Lead, an organized ground and air assault against military and police targets in Hamas-controlled Gaza, on December 27, 2008, sparking the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict. Background Number of Mortar & Rocket hits in Israel After its 2006 Palestinian legislative election victory, Hamas assumed administrative control of Gaza, consolidating its this control after a military conflict with Fatah. Israel and Egypt then partially sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that Fatah was no longer providing security. They imposed a blockade on the territory, prohibiting many exports and allowing only enough imported goods to avert a humanitarian or health crisis. After many acts of violence, foreign journalists left the Gaza strip due to the lack of security in the zone. As a result of the June 2007 tightening of the Israeli embargo on Gaza Hamas and other Palestinian paramilitias more than doubled the monthly number of Qassam rockets and mortars fired from the Gaza strip into Southern Israel. Israel conducted airstrikes and raids against Hamas and other targets in Gaza during 2007 and 2008. Hamas considers Israel an illegitimate state and Israel views Hamas as a terrorist group that must be dismantled.Gaza Truce May Be Revived by Necessity . By Ethan Bronner. The New York Times. Published 19 December 2008. There is no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanism in the understanding brokered between the two parties, neither of which recognizes the other, that would facilitate a formal ceasefire or armistice. After visiting Israel and Palestine in April 2008, former President Jimmy Carter stated that \\"Palestinian leaders from Gaza were noncommittal on all issues, these leaders claimed that rockets were the only way to respond to their imprisonment and to dramatize their humanitarian plight. The top Hamas leaders in Damascus, however, agreed to consider a cease-fire in Gaza only, provided Israel would not attack Gaza and would permit normal humanitarian supplies to be delivered to Palestinian citizens.\\" Hamas was willing to consider a cease- fire in both Gaza and the Fatah controlled West Bank, but the Israelis were only interested in a Gaza agreement. At the beginning of the cease-fire, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that \\"We have no illusions. The calm is fragile and likely to be short-lived.\\" He also said that \\"Hamas is the address in Gaza, and it carries responsibility for everything that happens in Gaza\\".Olmert: Gaza cease-fire is fragile, may be short lived .

Published 3 December 2008. The Israeli opposition in the Knesset blasted the agreement. Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu said, \\"This is not a relaxation, it's an Israeli agreement to the rearming of Hamas... What are we getting for this?\\" In Palestine, Authority President Mahmoud Abbas praised it, and he used the lull to seek reconciliation with Hamas. Ha'aretz has alleged that even at the very beginning of the cease-fire Defense Minister Ehud Barak prepared a comprehensive intelligence-gathering program setting up battle plans against Hamas. Ceasefire Terms The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) summarised the key components of the ceasefire as follows: :\\"On 19 June, at 6 am, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect. As part of the ceasefire, Palestinian militants agreed to immediately halt their attacks on Israel and Israel agreed to cease its military operations in Gaza. Israel also agreed to ease its blockade of Gaza and to gradually lift its ban on the import of a large number of commodities. The ceasefire is supposed to be in force for six months.\\" A report by the British House of Commons Library, published on 22 January 2009, provides Hamas' understanding of the terms of the ceasefire: # Mutual agreement to cease all military activities by the start of \\"zero hour\\" on Thursday 19 June, at 6:00 AM. # Duration of ceasefire is six months according to agreement concluded among the national parties under Egyptian auspices. # Ceasefire will be implemented under national consensus and under Egyptian auspices. # After 72 hours from the start of the ceasefire, the crossing points will be opened to allow 30 per cent more goods to enter the Gaza strip. # Ten days after that (i.e. thirteen days after ceasefire begins), all crossings would be open between Gaza and Israel, and Israel will allow the transfer of all goods that were banned or restricted to go into Gaza. # Egypt will work to expand the ceasefire into the West Bank later. The agreement also provided for \\"movement toward the release of Corporal Shalit\\". On the day of the agreement the BBC referred to the Shalit issue as \\"negotiations on the return of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit were expected to resume within a few days\\". Instead, Shalit's release would be dependent on Israel agreeing to a prisoner swap, and be discussed separately from the truce, as Hamas wanted. Shalit's father and grandfather attacked the Israeli government for leaving the soldier out of the cease-fire agreement. Ceasefire Progress According to The New York Times, neither side fully respected the terms of the cease-fire. Hamas undertook to stop other groups from firing rockets at Israel. It took some days, but it was largely successful, with Hamas imposing its will and even imprisoning some of those who were firing rockets. Nonetheless some rockets still continued to be fired from Gaza. On the other hand, the Israeli blockade of Gaza was loosened, but the goods shipments, while up some 25 to 30 percent and including a mix of more items, never began to approach the pre-blockade levels. Hamas hoped that the accord would lead Israel to suspend attacks on the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli forces continued to attack Hamas and other militants in the West Bank, prompting the rogue Palestinian militants in Gaza to fire rockets. The Israeli military also found several dozen improvised explosive devices and sniper fire cases on the Gaza border. Israel in turn hoped that the accord would lead to progress on negotiations for the release of Gilad Shalit; neither hope was met. USA Today stated on 1 July that it was not clear how Hamas would know definitively whether a rocket was fired. Several militant factions operate inside Gaza. But Israel had taken a zero tolerance policy towards the truce in which every rocket and/or mortar attack would be punished in some way. On 11 August 2008 Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that a military invasion of the Gaza Strip would not stop cross- border rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, but that the seven-week-old truce mediated by Egypt had halted the barrages for the first time in years. He said the numbers of short-range unguided rockets hitting Israel from Gaza had been reduced from hundreds to a handful. The same day a senior Hamas official said that the Islamic organization was not interested in renewing talks to free the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit until Israel completely lifted the siege on Gaza. =Israeli violations of the ceasefire prior to 4 November 2008= Palestinian Center for Human Rights recorded several IDF violations in the early days of the lull. On 19 June 2008, just a few hours after the beginning of the ceasefire Israeli forces opened fire against fishermen and farmers in Gaza.\\"IOF troops breach truce in Gaza Strip, shoot at Palestinian fishermen\\" Palestinian Information Center 20 June 2008 On 23 June, Israeli forces opened fire against children and farmers in northern Gaza Strip, wounding one of the farmers, Jameel 'Abdul Rahman al- Ghoul, 68, in the neck. Subsequently, a mortar was fired at Israel from Gaza. On 24 June 2008, Israel raided the city of Nablus on the West Bank, outside of the cease-fire area, killing a commander of Islamic Jihad and one other Palestinian. Before the raid, unknown militants had fired a mortar into Southern Israel. Later the same day, three Qassam rockets were fired from Gaza into Sderot, Israel, causing two minor injuries; Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, stating the attack was in response to the Israeli raid. Israel then closed border crossings into Gaza; this was criticized by Hamas which said Israel was \\"backtracking on the calm\\". MSNBC has described the violence that day as the truce's \\"first serious test\\". Both sides continued to pursue calm afterward. On 25 June, Israeli forces opened fire against farmers in southeastern Gaza Strip, injuring Salem Ahmed Abu Raida, 82, in the hand. Islamic Jihad threatened to renew rocket fire after the shooting. \\"We will respond to every Zionist violation at a suitable time,\\" a spokesman Abu Hamza said. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered the closure of all the crossings into the Gaza Strip. In response the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade fired a Qassam rocket at the western Negev the next day. On 28 June IDF troops killed 7-year-old Mohamed Al Allami during a military operation in the village of Beit Omer, south of Hebron. Islamic Jihad fired a rocket or mortar shell into southern Israel, threatening to resume rocket attacks if Israel continued military operations in the West Bank. On 29 June a Hamas official in charge of agriculture in the Gaza Strip Mohammad Ramadan Al-Agha said that the IDF was shooting at Gaza's farmers whenever they went to their land near the borders. On 1 July a Palestinian woman was shot and wounded in the leg by the Israeli Army near the Sufa border crossing in the southern Gaza Strip while she was tending her sheep. On 10 July Israeli troops killed an unarmed Palestinian near the border in the southern Gaza Strip, an IDF spokesman said. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed the victim had been one of its members. Palestinians fired two Qassam rockets into Israel's western Negev region, hours after the killing. Hamas arrested three militants from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades immediately after they launched the rockets at targets in Israel. On 14 July the PA Ministry of Agriculture said that 75 per cent of agricultural lands in the Gaza Strip had been razed by the IDF. On 23 July the IDF shot and wounded a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip. =Hamas' observance of the ceasefire prior to 4 November 2008= Prior to the incident on 4 November, in which Israeli forces destroyed a cross-border tunnel and killed six of its operatives, Hamas had been scrupulously adhering to the ceasefire – not firing rockets itself and reigning in other Palestinian groups. Hamas' adherence to the ceasefire was admitted by official Israeli spokesperson, Mark Regev. In an interview with David Fuller on More4 News (a sister programme of the U.K.'s Channel 4 News) on 9 January 2009, two weeks into Israel's assault on Gaza, Regev explained that \\"Success is freeing the civilian population of southern Israel from the fear of an incoming Hamas rockets.\\" When Fuller put it to Regev that \\"there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before 4 November, there were no Hamas rockets for 4 months\\", Regev replied: \\"That’s correct\\". Support for Regev's view is found in a document provided to journalists, published by Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre: \\"Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire\\". Despite Israel's refusal to comply with the truce agreement to end the siege, Hamas brought rocket and mortar fire from Gaza to a virtual halt during the summer and fall of 2008. Hamas \\"tried to enforce the terms of the arrangement\\" on other Palestinian groups, taking \\"a number of steps against networks which violated the arrangement,\\" including short-term detention and confiscating their weapons, but it could not completely end the rocket and mortar shell attacks by these rogue factions in Gaza. Hamas had sought support in Gazan public opinion for its policy of maintaining the ceasefire. =Violations of the Hamas-Israel agreement by other Gaza organisations= A week after the cease-fire agreement was reached, Hamas called on other Palestinian factions to abide by the truce. A rocket attack on Israel by al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades was condemned by Hamas as \\"unpatriotic.\\"Haniyeh: All Palestinian factions should honor truce . Ynet News. Published 26 Jun 2008.

On 28 June, Saeb Erekat, the PLO's chief negotiator, called upon all groups to honor the lull, calling it the \\"supreme Palestinian interest\\" above all else. The three rocket attacks made from 19 to 28 June led Israel to slow down the re- opening of Gaza border areas. On 29 June, the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center commented that Hamas preferred to exert outside pressure on the rocket attackers and refused to confront them directly. Hamas believed that 19 June agreement required it to end rocket attacks upon Israel in exchange for an end of the blockade. According to The New York Times: On 5 July Egyptian authorities found weapons and explosives in the Sinai desert they believe were destined for the Gaza Strip. On 8 July the IDF said Gaza militants fired a mortar shell into the western Negev in another violation of the truce. On 11 July Hamas arrested another four members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the village of Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip. On 12 and 13 July Gaza militants fired single rockets into Israel Rocket and mortar attacks continued at a rate of several rockets per month. Shortly after the start of the truce, the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center commented that \\"rogue terrorist organizations\\" opposed to Hamas continued to carry out attacks.Implementing the lull arrangement .

Nevertheless, rocket fire decreased 98% in the four and a half months between 18 June and 4 November when compared to the four and a half months preceding the ceasefire, since over 1,894 rockets were fired into Israel from 1 February to 18 June and just 37 were fired between 18 June and the beginning of November.Summary of Rocket Fire and Mortar Shelling in 2008 .

By Heather Sharp. BBC News. Published 11 November 2008. Fuel supplies increased from 55MW worth to 65MW worth. BBC News reported on 11 November that Gaza was then receiving only 28% of the amount of goods traded before the Hamas takeover. Israel has stated that food imports into the Strip were restricted by its inability to operate at border checkpoints facing constant Palestinian attack, and not because of any Israeli-imposed limits. It has accused Hamas of exacerbating fuel shortages by leading labor union strikes by power plant workers. It has also accused Hamas of underfunding the Gaza health care system, and then blaming the situation on Israel despite its free trade of medical supplies. It maintains that some individuals claiming to require medical attention in Israel were in fact planning terrorist attacks, therefore forcing the government to impose travel restrictions. It also accused Hamas of continuing the smuggling of weapons into the Gaza strip via tunnels to Egypt, pointing out that the rocket attacks had not completely ceased. Over the one- month period from 4 November to 8 December, about 700 truckloads of goods went into Gaza, which is about the amount of material that would have gone through in a single day without a blockade.Jimmy Carter on \\"An Unnecessary War\\" .

Israel directly tied his release to the cease-fire. However, the issue was not mentioned in the initial cease-fire itself, which led Shalit's father and grandfather to attack the Israeli government. In the early stage of the lull, Israeli officials had stated that they found \\"a certain sense of progress\\" on Shalit's release. Hamas considered Shalit's status to be entirely separate from the cease-fire negotiations themselves. It conditioned a deal about his release to the end of the Israeli blockade of Gaza.

Breaking of the Ceasefire On 4 November 2008, the IDF made an incursion at least 250 meters into the Gaza Strip searching for a tunnel, claiming it was intended for the capture of Israeli soldiers and that it intended to continue with the truce, calling the raid a \\"pinpoint operation\\". According to Dr. Robert Pastor, senior advisor to the Carter Center, who met with Khaled Meshal, chairman of the Hamas political bureau in Damascus, Hamas asserted that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel. Pastor said further that one IDF official confirmed that fact to him. As six Hamas fighters were killed, Hamas stated that the attack was a \\"massive breach of the truce\\". After the Israeli military attack on Hamas in Gaza on 4 November, Hamas resumed intensive rocket attacks on Israel. According to a 17 November article in The Telegraph, \\"since violence flared on 5 Nov, Israeli forces and militants, some of them from Hamas, have engaged in almost daily tit-for-tat exchanges.\\"Israel decides to maintain Gaza blockade The Telegraph. Published 17 November 2008. The reliability of the IDF allegation that the tunnel was intended to kidnap Israeli soldiers on the other side of the border has been challenged by various sources. A member of the Carter Centre, involved in negotiations at the time with both Hamas and Israel, reported that Hamas had claimed that the tunnel was defensive against IDF shelling, with an anonymous IDF officer confirming that fact. Likud MK Yuval Steinitz acknowledged in an al-Jazeera interview on 4 January 2009 that Israel began actively preparing for Operation Cast Lead months beforehand, around June 2008. Aftermath On 13 December 2008, Israel announced that it was in favor of extending the cease-fire, provided Hamas adhered to its conditions. The conditions posed by a Hamas delegation in Cairo on 14 December, were that the parties return to the original Hamas-Israel ceasefire arrangement. Hamas would undertake to stop all rocket attacks against Israel if the Israelis would agree to open up the border crossings, not to reduce commercial traffic thereafter, and not to launch attacks in Gaza. At an Israeli Cabinet meeting on 21 December, Yuval Diskin, head of Israel's internal security agency, said he thought Hamas was \\"interested in continuing the truce, but wants to improve its terms... It wants us to lift the siege [of Gaza], stop attacks, and extend the truce to include [the West Bank].\\" On 20 December, Hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire, which had expired on 19 December, citing Israeli border closures as the primary reason, and resumed its shelling of the western Negev. Hamas continued to offer a re-establishment of the cease-fire, given the Israeli government would accept its terms. The terms were defined as the lifting of the blockade and a complete ban of military incursions into Gaza. At that time, Hamas also refused European mediation of the talks to release Gilad Shalit, citing Israel's unwillingness to cooperate on a cease-fire agreement. On 23 December, Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior Hamas leader, said in a newspaper interview that his group was willing to consider renewing the hudna if Israel refrained from operating in Gaza and lifted its blockade. The same day the IDF killed three Palestinian militants, stating that the militants were planting explosives on the Gaza border. Israel was also reluctant to open the border crossings, which had been closed since November. On 24 December the Negev was hit by more than 60 mortar shells and Katyusha and Qassam rockets, and the IDF was given a green light to operate. Hamas claimed to have fired a total of 87 rockets and mortar rounds that day at Israel, code-naming the firing \\"Operation Oil Stain\\". On 25 December 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert delivered 'Last Minute' Warning to Gaza in direct appeal to Gaza's people via the Arabic language satellite channel al-Arabiya, to pressure their leaders to stop the barrages. \\"I am telling them now, it may be the last minute, I'm telling them stop it. We are stronger,\\" he said. The remnants of Qassam rockets that were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel. On 26 December 2008, Israel reopened five crossings between Israel and Gaza for humanitarian supplies. Despite the movement of relief supplies, militants fired about a dozen rockets and mortar shells from Gaza at Israel on Friday. Fuel was allowed in for Gaza's main power plant and about 100 trucks loaded with grain, humanitarian aid and other goods were expected during the day. Rocket attacks continued—about a dozen rockets and mortar bombs were fired from Gaza into Israel, one accidentally striking a northern Gaza house and killing two Palestinian sisters, aged five and thirteen, while wounding a third. According to Israeli military officials, the subsequent 27 December Israeli offensive Operation Cast Lead took Hamas by surprise, thereby increasing their casualties. A poll conducted before the rocket attacks on 24 December indicated that 46% of Israelis did not support the invasion of the Gaza Strip, while 40% did. A poll conducted on 1 January, four days after the operation begun, demonstrated that a decisive majority of Israelis support continuing the army's air campaign against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip without endangering the lives of Israel Defense Forces soldiers in a ground offensive. On 9 January public opinion poll in Israel indicated that 76% oppose truce without Gilad Shalit. Fatalities According to data from B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, at least nineteen Palestinians in the Strip died from Israeli fire during the ceasefire. Three of those were civilians, one of them a 15-year-old adolescent. The group's data also states that no Israeli civilian or Israeli security force personnel were killed by Palestinian attacks from the Strip in the same period.

Friehling (born November 27, 1959) is an American accountant who was arrested and charged in March 2009 for his role in the Madoff investment scandal. He subsequently pleaded guilty to rubber-stamping Bernard Madoff's filings with regulators rather than fully reviewing them. His role in covering up Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme makes it the largest accounting fraud in history. Early life Friehling was born in Sullivan County, north of New York City, and attended high school in Liberty, New York. His family owned the Stevensville Hotel, a Borscht Belt resort in Swan Lake, New York. He is a 1981 graduate of Cornell University, and a past-president of the Rockland chapter of the NYS Society of CPAs (NYSSCPA). Friehling & Horowitz as Madoff's auditors From 1991 to 2008, Friehling & Horowitz, a little-known accounting firm in New City, New York, a small hamlet in the Rockland County suburbs north of New York City, signed off on audits on Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC's books. Friehling falsely represented to investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission that he and the firm had audited the Madoff firm and that it was financially sound. In the meantime, Friehling and his family withdrew millions of dollars from accounts at the Madoff firm, over $5.5 million since 2000. Friehling's role in Madoff's fraud made it the largest accounting scandal ever uncovered, dwarfing the $11 billion accounting fraud masterminded by Bernard Ebbers at WorldCom. The firm consisted of two principals—Friehling and Jerome Horowitz—and a part-time secretary. Horowitz met Madoff in 1963 while working at the accounting firm run by Saul Alpern, Madoff's father-in-law. At the time, the Madoff organization was a penny stock trader. He audited Madoff's books for years, and took the Madoff account with him after starting his own firm. He retired to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in 1991 and handed the account to his son-in-law, Friehling. Horowitz died on March 12, 2009–the day Madoff entered his guilty plea–after a long battle with cancer; it is not known whether he was a target of the Madoff investigation.Hamblett, Mark. Madoff's Accountant Acknowledges Guilt, Casts Himself as Victim. New York Law Journal, November 4, 2009.Arrested Madoff accountant had Palm Beach Gardens partner. Palm Beach Post, March 4, 2009. Well before the Madoff scandal broke, several observers doubted that a tiny firm with only one active accountant could competently audit a firm that had grown into a multibillion-dollar operation. In 2007, Aksia LLC, a hedge fund consultant, warned its clients to stay away from Madoff for that very reason; its CEO, Jim Vos, likened this situation to General Motors being audited by a three-person firm.Fitzgerald, Jim. Madoff's financial empire audited by tiny firm: one guy. Associated Press via Seattle Times, December 18, 2008. Others were suspicious that Madoff refused requests for due diligence because his accountant—supposedly his brother-in-law—was the only one allowed to see the books. Indeed, for many years, Friehling's practice was so small that he operated out of his house. He only got an office when Madoff told him that some investors were asking questions about the audits. Even then, his operation remained very small; in 2008 it only garnered $180,000 in earnings, far less than conventional wisdom would suggest for a firm that was supposedly earning substantial fees from auditing the Madoff operation. Soon after the Madoff scandal broke, it emerged that Friehling & Horowitz had informed the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in writing since 1993 that it didn't conduct audits. An investigation into Friehling by Rockland County district attorney Thomas Zugibe was stopped in deferral to the investigation by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. However, he publicly claimed to have \\"hundreds of clients.\\" Friehling was not registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which was created under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to help detect fraud. Nor was the firm \\"peer reviewed\\", in which auditors check one another for quality control. According to the AICPA, Friehling was enrolled in their peer-review program, but was not required to participate because he supposedly didn't conduct audits. It later emerged that Madoff's banker, JPMorgan Chase, had known that Friehling wasn't registered with the PCAOB or subject to peer review as early as 2006. Additionally, officials at Fairfield Greenwich Group, operator of the largest Madoff feeder fund, had been aware as early as 2005 that Friehling was the firm's sole employee. Arrest, guilty plea, cooperation with federal government, and sentence Friehling was charged on March 18, 2009, with securities fraud, aiding and abetting investment adviser fraud, and four counts of filing false audit reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On July 10, 2009, Friehling waived indictment and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges. He agreed to proceed without having the evidence in the criminal case against him reviewed by a grand jury at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan. On November 3, 2009, he pleaded guilty to the charges against him. He admitted to simply rubber- stamping Madoff's filings with the SEC; rather than perform actual audits, he signed blank SEC forms before Madoff and others filled them in. He also revealed that he continued to audit Madoff even though he had invested a substantial amount of money with him; accountants aren't allowed to audit broker-dealers with whom they're investing. He agreed to forfeit $3.18 million in accounting fees and withdrawals from his account with Madoff, as well as his three-story, 4,400-square-foot house in New City and one other property. Friehling faced a maximum sentence of 114 years in prison, but unlike Madoff has agreed to cooperate with the government.Lieberman, Steve. Sentencing of Madoff's New City auditor put off again. The Journal News, 2014-07-04. The guilty plea effectively ended his career as an accountant; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. He lost his CPA license on July 19, 2010. Friehling's sentencing was originally set for February 2010, but was postponed several times at the prosecutors' request due to his cooperation with the government's effort to unwind Madoff's crimes. It was initially rescheduled to September 2010 (at the request of the prosecution, citing Friehling's \\"continuing cooperation with the Government\\").United States v. David Friehling – Court’s Order Adjourning Sentencing to Sept. 3, 2010, United States v. David G. Friehling, The United States Department of Justice, retrieved July 25, 2010 In March 2012 it was postponed to October 26, 2012. In July 2014, it was postponed to December 2014. In late 2014, it was postponed again.Lieberman, Steve. Friehling remains free, testifying in Madoff Ponzi scam. The Journal News, 2014-12-15. In May 2015, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain sentenced Friehling to one year of home detention and one year of supervised release. Friehling avoided prison because he cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors and because he had been unaware of the extent of Madoff's crimes. Addressing the court at the hearing, Friehling apologized to Madoff's victims. Referring to Madoff's reported statement that he was a \\"dumb auditor\\", Friehling said: \\"I would rather be regarded as dumb than crooked. I did not question what I should have questioned.\\"Matthew Goldstein, Madoff Accountant Avoids Prison Term, New York Times (May 28, 2015). Swain accepted the plea terms, but suggested that Friehling be forced to pay part of the overall $130 million forfeiture arising from the fraud. Swain said that she did not believe Friehling's nonfeasance took place \\"in a vacuum\\", and felt the forfeiture was necessary to hold the defendants to account even though it will likely never be repaid in full. SEC charges The SEC brought civil charges against Friehling and his firm. Madoff's firm paid Friehling between $12,000 and $14,500 a month for his services between 2004 and 2007. Personal life and family Friehling has three children.Lisa Cornell, Jeremy Friehling, Son of Bernard Madoff's Accountant, Kills Himself in Ohio, Huffington Post (November 18, 2012). Trusting in Madoff, he placed his own family's savings, including college savings, into Madoff's business. In November 2012, Friehling's 23-year-old son Jeremy Friehling, a second-year student at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, committed suicide.

It is considered to be the largest church in the Philippines and in Asia, standing long and wide. St. Martin of Tours is the patron saint of Taal, whose fiesta is celebrated every November 11. History =Earlier churches= In 1575, 3 years after the founding of Taal town in its old site near the shores of Taal Lake, work began on the construction of its first church by Father Diego Espinar (O.S.A.) with Saint Martin of Tours as patron saint. The church was rebuilt in 1642 using stronger materials but in 1754, it was destroyed along with the town of Taal in the largest recorded eruption of Taal volcano. This event led to transfer of the town and the church farther away from the volcano to its present site atop an elevated hill facing Balayan Bay. The ruins of the previous church can still be seen in San Nicolas. Father Martín Aguirre donated the land and began the construction of the new church in 1755. It was continued by Fr. Gabriel Rodriguez in 1777 and by Fr. Jose Victoria in 1782. Fr. Ramon del Marco decorated the church, built the convent and paved the \\"processional\\" road with bricks around the atrium of the parochial building.Diocese of Taal. \\"St. Martin of Tours Brochure \\". Retrieved on May 17, 2011. This church was damaged by a strong earthquake on September 16, 1852. The earthquake centered near Taal Volcano, though no volcanic eruption was recorded.Maso (1904), p.75.Maso (1904), p.63 = Present church = Construction of the present church began in 1856 by Fr. Marcos Antón with Spanish architect Luciano Oliver, commissioned to design and manage the construction of the new church. Although it was unfinished, it was inaugurated in 1865. The huge church was completed by Fr. Agapito Aparicio in 1878, adding the main altar of Doric style measuring high and wide. He was also responsible for the baptistery made with tiles imported from Europe. The stone church had three naves with a grand transept and an elegant facade with Ionic and Doric orders. A small tower on the left side of the facade contained the large church bell, which in 1942, was destroyed by an earthquake. =Minor Basilica and further renovations= Nave of Taal Basilica prior to its renovation by Msgr. Alfredo Madlangbayan The church was then restored in 1953 in preparation for the Canonical Coronation of the Our Lady of Caysasay. The following year on December 8, 1954, the church was declared as a Minor Basilica, the third in the country to be given such honor. The church was again restored in 1972 by the Taal Quadricentennial Council for the 400th anniversary of the town's establishment. By Presidential Decree No. 375 on January 16, 1974, the church was declared a National Shrine. The old belfry was later rebuilt in 1990 under the supervision of the National Historical Institute. In 2011, upon the assignment of Msgr. Alfredo Madlangbayan, the Basilica underwent another renovation as sections the church interior were repainted to its original trompe l'oeil ceilings. The tower was also modified to imitate the old tower destroyed by the earthquake of 1942, a new set of carillon bells was later installed. The renovations was completed in November that same year. On April 4, 2017, the Basilica was damaged by a 5.5 earthquake that struck Tingloy, Batangas. The Basilica was significantly damaged again caused by twin earthquakes (magnitudes 5.6 and 6.0) that struck the neighboring towns of Mabini and Taysan that occurred on April 8.

He moved to London with his family in the 1930s as a refugee from Francoist Spain. He taught fine art and sculpture at Rugby School, where colleagues considered him \\"highly entertaining, a most unorthodox and highly gifted\\" teacher. He established himself during the 1960s and early 1970s as an authority on sculpture, publishing in academic journals and becoming a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors. In 1974, Barraclough was appointed to a three-year contract as professor of fine arts at the University of the Witwatersrand. some colleagues there did not think well of his work, and he was transferred to a job at an associated gallery. In 2000, it was revealed that Barraclough, while outwardly living the life of anti-apartheid activist since the 1970s, had been a paid informant of the South African state security police.

It is perhaps best remembered as the setting for the first Republican National Convention, June 17–19, 1856. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Originally the building housed the First Presbyterian Church; it was converted into the largest musical auditorium in Philadelphia by William Strickland and opened in December 1824. Noted for its fine acoustics, the Hall was described in a newspaper review of the first concert: \\"The room is exceedingly neat, and its decoration does honor to the taste of Mr. Strickland, an architect of whom Philadelphia may be justly proud. It is one hundred and six feet long, sixty feet wide, and twenty-six feet high, and is admirably calculated for the conveyance of sound...\\" As it continued to serve as the leading concert hall in the city, the building was renovated in 1847 by Napoleon LeBrun and expanded by architect Addison Hutton in 1891. Internationally known musical artists, authors and lecturers graced the stage of the Musical Fund Hall, including: *1825: Marquis de Lafayette, honored at a reception *1827: Maria Malibran *1848: Ole Bull, violinist *1842: Charles Dickens *1850 and 1851: Jenny Lind, \\"the Swedish Nightingale\\"; Ede Reményi *1852: Henriette Sontag and Adelina Patti *1853 and 1856: William Makepeace Thackeray, lectures on the \\"English Humorists\\" (1853) and \\"Charity and Humor\\" (1856) *1897: poet Paul Laurence Dunbar read selections of his own works Renowned pianists such as Louis Gottschalk, Kossowski, Sigismond Thalberg, and Wolfsohn also appeared at the Hall. In 1856, the first National Republican Convention was held at the Musical Fund Hall. John C. Frémont was nominated on the second ballot. William L. Dayton of New Jersey was the vice-presidential nominee. Musical Fund Hall in 2012 With its busy and notable schedule of events, 1856 was the banner year for the Musical Fund Hall. By the end of the year, the 3,000-seat Philadelphia Academy of Music opened and immediately supplanted the Musical Fund Hall as the premier venue for concerts and lectures in the city. The Musical Fund Society moved its concerts to the Academy of Music in 1868. After seeing use as (among other things) a boxing arena and a tobacco warehouse, the Hall was abandoned, then was converted into condominiums. As a result of the conversion, the auditorium no longer exists. The building was removed from the list of National Historic Landmarks but it retains a position on the National Register of Historic Places. Around 1900, the society was a main proponent in creating the Philadelphia Orchestra.Phono Archive In 1982, The Musical Fund Society's document collection including manuscripts of European music as well as music by Pennsylvania composers, went to the library of the University of Pennsylvania. http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/music/mfs.html University of Pennsylvania’s Rare Book and Manuscript Libraryhttp://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/rbm/mss/ Library of the University of Pennsylvania References Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Concert halls in Pennsylvania Religious buildings and structures completed in 1824 Washington Square West, Philadelphia Buildings and structures in Philadelphia National Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia ","title":"Musical Fund Hall"},{"id":"21118565","text":"The Battle of Flarcheim was fought between German king Henry IV and the German anti-king Rudolf of Swabia on January 27, 1080 near Flarchheim. Prelude Rudolf appeared to be vulnerable after losing the support of some of the Saxon princes. Henry decided to take advantage of this vulnerability and marched out against him in the winter of 1079–1080. Rudolf sought out Henry and met him at Flachheim between Eisenach and Mühlhausen in Thuringia. Battle Rudolf had arrayed his army on a hill behind a stream. Rather than attack Rudolf and possibly get caught with his forces straddling the stream, Henry opted to march around the obstacle. Henry struck Rudolf's army from the rear, but with ensuing snowstorm the attack became disorganized. On one hand there are reports of the Saxons being attacked and driven off after duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia cut down the Saxon standard during the snowstorm. Consequently, Vratislaus was able to capture Rudolf's golden lance. On the other hand, Ekkehard of Aura reports that Otto of Nordheim attacked and plundered Henry's camp before forcing the surrender of the Franconians and the Bohemians. Berthold (possibly Berthold of Ratisbon) states that the armies became separated in the dark and that Rudolf was forced to withdraw to a neighboring village by the cold. The next day Rudolf returned to the field, but Henry had withdrawn to Franconia.

Some of these attributes are: sentiment, relevance, and novelty. Expressing news stories as numbers and metadata permits the manipulation of everyday information in a mathematical and statistical way. This data is often used in financial markets as part of a trading strategy or by businesses to judge market sentiment and make better business decisions. News analytics are usually derived through automated text analysis and applied to digital texts using elements from natural language processing and machine learning such as latent semantic analysis, support vector machines, \\"bag of words\\" among other techniques. Applications and strategies The application of sophisticated linguistic analysis to news and social media has grown from an area of research to mature product solutions since 2007. News analytics and news sentiment calculations are now routinely used by both buy-side and sell side in alpha generation, trading execution, risk management, and market surveillance and compliance. There is however a good deal of variation in the quality, effectiveness and completeness of currently available solutions. A large number of companies use news analysis to help them make better business decisions.Tetlock, Paul C.,Does Public Financial News Resolve Asymmetric Information?(November 1, 2008). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1303612 Academic researchers have become interested in news analysis especially with regards to predicting stock price movements, volatility and traded volume. Provided a set of values such as sentiment and relevance as well as the frequency of news arrivals, it is possible to construct news sentiment scores for multiple asset classes such as equities, Forex, fixed income, and commodities. Sentiment scores can be constructed at various horizons to meet the different needs and objectives of high and low frequency trading strategies, whilst characteristics such as direction and volatility of asset returns as well as the traded volume may be addressed more directly via the construction of tailor-made sentiment scores. Scores are generally constructed as a range of values. For instance, values may range between 0 and 100, where values above and below 50 convey positive and negative sentiment, respectively. Based on such sentiment scores, it should be possible to generate a set of strategies useful for instance within investing, hedging, and order execution. = Absolute return strategies = The objective of absolute return strategies is absolute (positive) returns regardless of the direction of the financial market. To meet this objective, such strategies typically involve opportunistic long and short positions in selected instruments with zero or limited market exposure. In statistical terms, absolute return strategies should have very low correlation with the market return. Typically, hedge funds tend to employ absolute return strategies. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the absolute return strategy space with the purpose to identify alpha opportunities applying a market neutral strategy or based on volatility trading. Example 1 Scenario: The gap between the news sentiment scores for direction, S, of Company X and Market Y has moved beyond +20. That is, S_X-S_Y ≥ 20. Action: Buy the stock on Company X and short the future on Market Y. Exit Strategy: When the gap in the news sentiment scores for direction of Company X and Market Y has disappeared, S_X-S_Y = 0, sell the stock on Company X and go long the future on Market Y to close the positions. Example 2 Scenario: The news sentiment score for volatility of Company X goes above 70 out of 100 indicating an expected volatility above the option implied volatility. Action: Buy a short-dated straddle (the purchase of both a put and a call) on the stock of Company X. Exit Strategy: Keep the straddle on Company X until expiry or until a certain profit target has been reached. = Relative return strategies= The objective of relative return strategies is to either replicate (passive management) or outperform (active management) a theoretical passive reference portfolio or benchmark. To meet these objectives such strategies typically involve long positions in selected instruments. In statistical terms, relative return strategies often have high correlation with the market return. Typically, mutual funds tend to employ relative return strategies. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the relative return strategy space with the purpose to outperform the market applying a stock picking strategy and by making tactical tilts to ones asset allocation model. Example 1 Scenario: The news sentiment score for direction of Company X goes above 70 out of 100. Action: Buy the stock on Company X. Exit Strategy: When the news sentiment score for direction of Company X falls below 60, sell the stock on Company X to close the position. Example 2 Scenario: The news sentiment score for direction of Sector Z goes above 70 out of 100. Action: Include Sector Z as a tactical bet in the asset allocation model. Exit Strategy: When the news sentiment score for direction of Sector Z falls below 60, remove the tactical bet for Sector Z from the asset allocation model. =Financial risk management= The objective of financial risk management is to create economic value in a firm or to maintain a certain risk profile of an investment portfolio by using financial instruments to manage risk exposures, particularly credit risk and market risk. Other types include Foreign exchange, Shape, Volatility, Sector, Liquidity, Inflation risks, etc. As a specialization of risk management, financial risk management focuses on when and how to hedge using financial instruments to manage costly exposures to risk. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the financial risk management space with the purpose to either arrive at better risk estimates in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) or to manage the risk of a portfolio to meet ones portfolio mandate. Example 1 Scenario: The bank operates a VaR model to manage the overall market risk of its portfolio. Action: Estimate the portfolio covariance matrix taking into account the development of the news sentiment score for volume. Implement the relevant hedges to bring the VaR of the bank in line with the desired levels. Example 2 Scenario: A portfolio manager operates his portfolio towards a certain desired risk profile. Action: Estimate the portfolio covariance matrix taking into account the development of the news sentiment score for volume. Scale the portfolio exposure according to the targeted risk profile. =Computer algorithms using news analytics= Within 0.33 seconds, computer algorithms using news analytics can notify subscribers * which company the news is about, * if the news article sentiment is positive or negative, * if the news is ranked as high or low relative importance … relative relevance. * the stock price reaction and the increase in trade volume is concentrated in the first 5 seconds after an news article is released.First to “Read” the News: News Analytics and Algorithmic Trading von Beschwitz, Bastian, Donald B. Keim, and Massimo Massa Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Number 1233 July 2018 Page 4 of 67 =Algorithmic order execution= The objective of algorithmic order execution, which is part of the concept of algorithmic trading, is to reduce trading costs by optimizing on the timing of a given order. It is widely used by hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, and other institutional traders to divide up large trades into several smaller trades to manage market impact, opportunity cost, and risk more effectively. The example below shows how news analysis can be applied in the algorithmic order execution space with the purpose to arrive at more efficient algorithmic trading systems. Example 1 Scenario: A large order needs to be placed in the market for the stock on Company X. Action: Scale the daily volume distribution for Company X applied in the algorithmic trading system, thus taking into account the news sentiment score for volume. This is followed by the creation of the desired trading distribution forcing greater market participation during the periods of the day when volume is expected to be heaviest. Effects Being able to express news stories as numbers permits the manipulation of everyday information in a statistical way that allows computers not only to make decisions once made only by humans, but to do so more efficiently. Since market participants are always looking for an edge, the speed of computer connections and the delivery of news analysis, measured in milliseconds, have become essential.

Its football departement was active from 1953 and until 1966. Football =History= The club was founded as SG Dynamo Berlin in April 1953, and was the first club to bear the name Dynamo Berlin. Its football team entered the second tier DDR-Liga in 1953, taking the spot of the recently dissolved football department of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam. According to some sources, the team of SG Dynamo Berlin was formed from SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin, which had initially taken over the spot of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam in the 1952-53 DDR-Liga and absorbed the football team of SG Volkspolizei Potsdam. SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin was founded in 1949. SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin was reformed as SG Dynamo Berlin in April 1953 following the founding of SV Dynamo. When SC Dynamo Berlin was founded in 1954, the club, now relegated to the fourth tier Bezirksliga, was quickly renamed SG Dynamo Berlin-Mitte. In the 1956 season, SG Dynamo Berlin-Mitte earned promotion to the third tier 2. DDR-Liga, at which point it was merged with the reserve team of SC Dynamo Berlin, the SC Dynamo Berlin 1b, under the name SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen. While the new club was technically an independent club, it was, in practice, a feeder club to SC Dynamo Berlin, and regularly featured promising youngsters and retiring veterans from its parent club. SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen was promoted back to the DDR-Liga in 1959, and, after one relegation from which it immediately recovered, stabilised in the second tier. SC Dynamo Berlin was restructured in 1966, with the football department separated from the Sports Club and reformed as football club BFC Dynamo. This meant the end of SG Dynamo Hohenschönhausen, with its players transferred to the reserve team of BFC Dynamo. =Seasons= {class=\\"wikitable float-right\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\" !

The ice hockey section of SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin was created in 1950 and made its debut in a friendly match against BSG Einheit Berliner Bär in the Werner-Seelenbinder- Halle on 9 June 1951. SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin managed to win the Berlin championship the same year and qualified for the promotion round for the 1951-52 DDR-Oberliga. The qualification round failed due to lack of participation from other teams, and SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin was promoted to the DDR-Oberliga. However, its stay in the DDR-Oberliga was to be short and the club was relegated after only one season. SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Berlin became SG Dynamo Berlin after the founding of SV Dynamo on 27 March 1953. The club immediately qualified for a new promotion round for the DDR-Oberliga after an unbeaten 1952-53 season. SG Dynamo Berlin won the promoted round and thus had the right to participate in the 1953–54 DDR- Oberliga. However, its participation in the 1953-54 DDR-Oberliga was prevented as the team was dissolved on order from the sports authorities and had to transfer its best players, such as Hans Frenzel and Wolfgang Nickel, to competitor BSG Chemie Weißwasser. The ice hockey section of SG Dynamo Berlin then became an ice hockey section of the newly founded sports club SC Dynamo Berlin in 1954.

She has worked for Adelaide's The Advertiser, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, the Sunday Age and The Sun-Herald, and won a Walkley Award in 2009 for her Quarterly Essay, \\"Stop at Nothing: The Life and Adventures of Malcolm Turnbull\\". She has written two books covering events within the Australian Labor Party, as well as The Wife Drought, a book about women's work–life balance. She has hosted ABC television shows Kitchen Cabinet, The House, and Back in Time for Dinner. Early years Crabb was born in Adelaide to Christobel and Mac Crabb, and grew up on a small farm near Two Wells, South Australia. She completed high school at the Wilderness School in Medindie, South Australia, then studied at University of Adelaide, graduating in 1997 with Arts and Law degrees. She was briefly involved in student politics, holding the position of women's officer at the University's Student Association. Career =Journalism= Crabb undertook a cadetship at The Advertiser in 1997. She moved to The Advertiser's Canberra bureau two years later, having worked for The Advertiser in both state and federal politics, before departing in 2000 to move to The Age as a political columnist and correspondent. Three years later Crabb travelled to the United Kingdom and spent several years there working as the London correspondent for the Sunday Age and Sun-Herald, and acting as an occasional and largely non-political correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald. During this time she wrote her first book, Losing It: The Inside Story of the Labor Party in Opposition. She returned to Australia in 2007 and started work as a senior writer and political columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, and until recently, Crabb's opinion pieces featured in a regular column in the publication. During this time, Crabb served as a commentator for the ABC's coverage of the 2007 Australian federal election. Crabb took up a position with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in November 2009, working as its chief online political writer. Crabb is also one of the presenters of The Drum on the 24-hour news channel, ABC News 24. In September 2014, Crabb's book The Wife Drought was published, contributing to the debate about work-life balance for women. In 2017, in a footnote to readers of her Sydney Morning Herald column, Crabb implied that she had resigned from her role at that newspaper. =Television= From mid-2012, Crabb and radio personality Merrick Watts appeared in the ABC1 light-entertainment television program Randling, as part of a team called the West Coast Odd Sox. Crabb is a regular panelist on the ABC Television political show Insiders, a guest on panel shows such as Network Ten's Good News Week and the ABC's Q&A.; Crabb was a panelist on the 2010 ABC Federal Election series, Gruen Nation. She returned to her role on the panel for the 2013 series. In 2012, Crabb began hosting her own TV program Kitchen Cabinet on ABC2 (later ABC1), an informal interview program with Australian politicians over a meal prepared by both Crabb and her guest. In 2017, Crabb hosted a six episode documentary series about the inner workings of Parliament House called The House. In 2018, she hosted a seven part series called Back in Time for Dinner, based on the format of UK show Back in Time for.... A family's home is transformed each week into a replica of a standard house from a different decade, with the family cooking and eating meals from that era. In May 2018, the ABC flew Crabb and Jeremy Fernandez to London to host coverage of the Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. =Podcast= In November 2014, Crabb started a podcast with Leigh Sales called Chat 10 Looks 3. It is independent of the work they do for other media outlets and is an opportunity for them to talk about books, movies, television, the media and culture. Political views Crabb is a regular political commentator with the ABC and Fairfax. She has written of former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott that as an opposition leader he was \\"potent, focused, absolutely deadly, and ultimately he succeeded\\", but of his period as Prime Minister she writes that Abbott's \\"most significant achievements... were acts of dismantlement or shutting down: ending the carbon and mining taxes, stopping the boats.\\" In a May 2016 study of Abbott's successor Malcolm Turnbull she wrote that he \\"struggled as Opposition leader\\", his major flaw being that \\"he overleapt his colleagues in an attempt to build something\\". Of his Prime Ministership she wrote: \\"Turnbull is more upbeat, more expansive (\\"waffly,\\" his critics would say), less disciplined and less aggressive\\". Following the election of Donald Trump as US President in 2016, Crabb asked \\"Where will Angry White Man strike next?\\" and wrote: \\"A kind of madness has come over the world. The elevation of Donald Trump from talented freelance bottom-pincher to Leader of the Free World, substantially powered by angry white dudes in Michigan, has created, internationally, a mood of fear and uncertainty among the existing political class.\\"\\\\ Crabb does not support reform of the controversial Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 limitations on free speech. She describes Immigration Minister Peter Dutton as having a commitment to free speech which \\"fully covers the right of everyday Australians to make racist remarks\\". Crabb supported proposals to legislate for same-sex marriage; proposals that were ultimately successful.}}cite weburl=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/sexuality/article/2015/12/01/cory- bernardis-gay-marriage-grilling-kitchen-cabinet title=Cory Bernardi's gay marriage grilling on Kitchen Cabinetfirst=Drewlast=Sheldrickwork=sbs.com.audate=2 December 2015accessdate=13 September 2019}} She has described businesses and service providers who refuse to cater to same-sex weddings as \\"homophobes\\".  Gendered impacts of caring on work  Crabb has reported on the differential impact of parenting on workforce productivity and that following the birth of a child, fathers spend, on average, half the number of hours on household work that mothers do. Crabb shared demographic analysis by Jennifer Baxter of the Australian Institute of Family Studies showing that women spend on average 30 hours per week on household work, whereas men spend 15. In the 7am podcast, Crabb described the pattern, saying the graph \\"just leapt off the page\\", and that men's average work hours follow a flat line 'like a cruiser, just cruising along\\". Crabb reported \\"Whenever she (Baxter) shows the graph at conferences, people just go... (intake of breath)\\". The analysis looks at paid working hours, child care and unpaid domestic work in heterosexual couples. \\"The work is so evocative, like in ER when someone has a very dangerous elevation, the heartbeat of a highly stressed and anxious person\\". She suggests that by changing both Australian laws and societal pressures, the problem may be addressed, and that fathers may have more time and stronger relationships with their children. Crabb has reported on policy which has changed gendered aspects of parenting and work.She has reported on policy which has changed this. She said, \\"Employers are starting to recognise that the fathers of a young generation do want to be more involved in their kids lives than their dads were and that if you want to attract and retain great staff then trusting them to make the right decision in their private lives only strengthens their attachment to your workplace and commitment to the job you want them to do.\\"  Personal life  Crabb's partner is lawyer Jeremy Storer, brother of Australian senator Tim Storer. They have three children.

It aims to encourage film makers who use their cameras to document struggles against discrimination, injustice and violence. We have been working towards this festival since 2009 and we are delighted that the first Human Rights Film Festival held in Kabul on 1–7 October 2011. The festival is being organised by the Afghanistan Cinema Club with the support of various national and international organizations. It aims to be a hub for film makers and artists working despite of censorship in their countries and whose works are restricted from public screenings. The AHRF is a platform to share the works of film makers and artists who have unfortunately been marginalized by the authority. It will present stories of lives affected by war, discrimination and injustice. These stories are of people who have resisted oppression and fought against violence to create a more humane world.

Early life Fowler was born in Lingfield, Surrey, where his father was the clerk of the course at Lingfield Park Racecourse. He moved with his family to Bedford Park, London following his father's death in 1915. He was educated Tormore prep school, and at Felsted School. He left school aged 16 in 1923. Career He joined the decorating and antiques firm Thornton Smith, where he painted Chinese-style wallpaper (sold as 18th century originals), and learned other paint decoration techniques, such as marbling and graining. He moved to work in the studio of decorator Margaret Kunzer, and started to decorate furniture for Peter Jones. He established his own business on the Kings Road in Chelsea in 1934, and then went into business with Sybil Colefax, founding Colefax & Fowler. His short sightedness made him medically unfit for military service in the Second World War, but he became an air raid warden and hospital orderly. The decorating business went through a slump during the privations of wartime and post-war austerity, and the business was bought by Nancy Tree (then married to Ronald Tree, and later to Claude Lancaster), principally so they would redecorate her house at Haseley Court. Their personalities clashed: Nancy Astor described them as \\"the most unhappy unmarried couple in England\\". He leased the Hunting Lodge at Odiham in Hampshire from the National Trust in 1947, and his simple but elegant decorative scheme made a great impact. As wartime restrictions relaxed, the decorating business prospered, and Fowler was involved in the redecoration of dozens of substantial country houses and town houses, including Radbourne Hall, Daylesford House, Tyninghame House and Grimsthorpe Castle. He collaborated with John Cornforth to write English Decoration in the 18th Century, published in 1976. He considered himself a \\"haute couture decorator\\" but aimed for simple or humble elegance. He also worked on decorative schemes for Buckingham Palace, Holyroodhouse, Chequers, Chevening, Christ Church, Oxford, and the Bank of England. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1973 and retired in 1975 but had been an adviser to the National Trust since the 1950s and continued to provide them with his advice. He worked on at least 30 of the National Trust's properties, including in particular Clandon Park, Sudbury Hall and Erddig. He died of cancer. He never married. After his death his home at Odiham was leased by interior designer Nicky Haslam.

Plot summary A young man from Mallorca analyzes the crisis of bourgeois consciousness through the sparse writing of prose and poems that express repression, the desire for freedom, and the discovery of love and pleasure. The boy struggles with his inner contradictions to eliminate old prejudices and transform society. Both the work and the act of writing are presented as acts of rebellion against the establishment — Catholicism, police oppression, society based on the traditional family, and the traditional road to riches. The young man discovers gradually the culture that he had been denied him due to a punitive religious education. A narrator presents the work as one in which the teenager expresses his point of view, emotions, fears and insights. The idea is that the reader advances through the text in a dialectical way to come to his or her own conclusions. Cheska, the protagonist’s girlfriend who studies theater, will be on the receiving end of the adolescent’s literary efforts. Major themes His mother serves as a symbol of oppression: through her monologues, we understand the challenge that the reading of her son’s pages has posed to her traditional values. The father represents power and authority, and, finally, the study group provides the brushstrokes of historical context. Analysis The reader participates in a meta-text that imitates the style of the school punishments, religious dogmas, and press releases, that is mixed in with the nascent writings of the teenager. Stylistically, the text is notable for the fragmentation and mixture of genres: diary, letter, prose, poem, comics, etc. Formal innovation is presented disruptively in several ways: quotes are recurrent and demanding; the typography is used to denounce or to highlight characters or ideas; the footnotes acquire narrative and theoretical value; the fiction within a fiction assumes a Brechtian ethico-revolutionary character. Drawings, handwritten lines, censored cutouts and galley proofs provoke the reader’s reflection. Awards and nominations L’adolescent de sal marked a milestone in 1970s Catalonia, and won the Prudenci Bertrana prize.

It involves the playing of a message to the called party when they have answered a call, during which time the calling party continues to hear ringing. The called party can then decide whether to accept the call (usually by pressing a particular key whereupon the call will be put through to them) or to reject it (either by pressing a key or simply hanging up). They can also identify the caller by their caller ID number or answer the phone in an appropriate manner for the number that has been dialed. Customization The call whisper feature can be customized, depending on the options offered by the hosting product, in many ways: *The message played to the ‘called party’ can be customized to convey any relevant information that can be of assistance to the answering agent such as the number that has been dialed, a particular product for which the caller requires support, etc. *An element of dynamic content can be introduced to the recording so that it responds to the caller ID in an intelligent way e.g. it could simply read out the caller ID of the caller, it could specifically advise what location the call is coming from, based on the caller ID, or it could check the caller ID against a customer database and therefore advise the agent which customer is calling in and what their account number is. *The amount of time the system waits for the call to be accepted or rejected can be shortened or lengthened. This can be particularly useful if there is a possibility of an automated messaging service answering the call creating the need to prevent useless voicemail recordings of the call whisper message being left in the mailbox. Advantages of using call whisper Because call whisper settings are specific to a particular non-geographic telephone number, the feature can allow the called party to identify which telephone number the caller has dialed. For instance, ten separate numbers can all be routing their inbound calls to a single destination number. However, each of the ten numbers could have their own customized call whisper message on them relating to the nature of the call i.e. the function of the number that has been dialed. Therefore, the agent answering will know the number that has been dialed and thus the appropriate way to answer the call. Whisper messages also allow businesses to identify the success of their marketing campaigns by being able to identify which campaign the phone number was assigned to; for example, different numbers can be assigned to billboard advertisements, online ads, printed brochures, and contact information on a website.

Early life Thomas Brand was born the only son of Timothy Brand, a mercer of Ingatestone, Essex, and his wife Sarah Michell of Rickling. He was educated at Brentwood School and Felsted School. He attended Glasgow University. There he was a friend of Richard Baron: both were nonconformists influenced by Francis Hutcheson. He turned down the chance to study at the Inner Temple in 1741, but did befriend the political philosopher and writer Thomas Hollis through the inns of court. In 1748–9 Brand toured Europe with Hollis,. He made further European travels from 1750 to 1753. In June 1756 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Heir to Thomas Hollis On his death in 1774, Hollis left his estate, at Corscombe and Halstock in Dorset, to Brand on condition that Brand added the name of Hollis to his own name. Political activity Brand Hollis sided with the revolutionary activity in Great Britain's American colonies. He corresponded with Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, and had Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom reprinted in a local newspaper, the Chelmsford Gazette. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782. In 1774 Brand Hollis was briefly elected to Parliament as the member for Hindon, Wiltshire, by spending 15 guineas per vote. On petition the election was declared void due to bribery by the winning candidates. He and his fellow candidate, Richard Smith, were prosecuted, fined one thousand marks, and imprisoned for six months. In a rerun of the election Brand Hollis withdrew his name but Smith was re-elected. Brand Hollis was in 1780 a founder of the Society for Constitutional Information, and a local member of the Yorkshire Association. He worked with John Jebb on a plan for electoral reform, radical and incorporating ideas from James Burgh. He became a Unitarian, and campaigned against the Test Acts. The Hyde, Essex residence of Thomas Brand Hollis The Hyde Brand Hollis resided at The Hyde, a country house in Essex bought by his father in 1718, and improved for him in 1761 by William Chambers. In July 1786, he entertained there his friend John Adams, the first American ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Adams stayed for several days, as recorded in his memoirs. Death and aftermath On his death in 1804 Brand Hollis left Corscombe and his own property in Ingatestone to John Disney, a personal friend. Disney erected a monument to him in Ingatestone Church, and published his Memoirs of Thomas Brand Hollis in 1808. The Hyde was demolished in 1965, following damage in a fire.

Though best known for his translation of sections of Ban Gu's Book of Han, he published on a wide range of topics in ancient Chinese history, astronomy and philosophy. Raised in China as the son of missionaries, he returned to the United States and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy (1925). He taught at University of Minnesota and Marshall College before undertaking the Han shu translation project at the behest of the American Council of Learned Societies. Subsequently, Dubs taught at Duke University, Columbia University and Hartford Seminary. In 1947, Dubs moved to England to take up the Chair of Chinese at Oxford University, which had been vacant since 1935. He retired in 1959 and remained in Oxford until his death in 1969. Early years Homer H. Dubs, like many early American sinologists, had his introduction to the subject as the child of missionary parents in China. Born in Deerfield, Illinois, he spent his childhood in Hunan Province. He studied briefly at Oberlin College and then graduated from Yale University (1914) with a major in philosophy. Subsequently, he earned an A.M. in philosophy at Columbia University and a B.D. at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. He returned to China as a missionary, studying Chinese in Nanjing before moving on to work in Hunan. Returning from China, Dubs attended the University of Chicago and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1925 with a dissertation entitled \\"The Philosophy of Hsüntze: Ancient Confusionism [sic] as Developed in the Philosophy of Hsüntze\\", which was the basis for his later two-volume work on the Xunzi. After receiving his degree, Dubs taught philosophy, first at University of Minnesota (1925–27) and then at Marshall College (1927–34).Luther Carrington Goodrich. Homer Dubs (1892-1969), Journal of Asian Studies, 29 (1970): 889-91. Research and publishing Throughout his life, Dubs researched and published on a wide range of topics in Chinese philosophy and history. In the mid-1930s he was commissioned by the American Council of Learned Societies to undertake the work for which he would become best known, a translation of Ban Gu's Han shu. During 1934-37, Dubs worked on the translation assiduously with three Chinese collaborators, Jen T'ai, C.H. Ts'ui, and P'an Lo-chi. They produced a copiously annotated three-volume translation of the \\"Annals\\" section of the Han shu (chapters 1-12) and the three chapters (99A,B&C;) devoted to Wang Mang, published under the title History of the Former Han Dynasty (Baltimore, 1938–55). The first two volumes were awarded the coveted Prix Stanislas Julien of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Two companion volumes, including a prolegomena and a glossary were planned. Dubs' publications on China (he remained interested in philosophy throughout his life) were characterized by solid scholarship and an extraordinary breadth of interests. He did pioneering work on ancient Chinese astronomy, in particular the observance of eclipses. But the breadth of his education and interests combined with a fertile mind to lead him into curious directions. One was his development of an idiosyncratic system of romanization in which the Chinese characters were replaced by a system of letters and numbers that indicated the pronunciation, tone and constituent elements of the original Chinese graph.David B. Honey. Incense at the Altar: Pioneering Sinologists and the Development of Classical Chinese Philology. American oriental series, v. 86. New Haven, Conn: American Oriental Society, 2001, 261-5 Thus, Qian Han shu (Wade Giles Ch'ien Han shu) 前漢書 was rendered Ts'ien2R Han4SU-shu1WE. Although he represented his system as a variation on the widely used Wade Giles romanization, the field declined to adopt his \\"Wade-Dubs\\" system. Indeed, it was his insistence on using the system for the remaining volumes of History of the Former Han Dynasty that prevented them from being published. Another direction Dubs' interests took him was the pursuit of contacts between Han China and the Roman empire. He wrote several articles on the subject, culminating in the controversial A Roman City in Ancient China.A Roman City in Ancient China. China Society Sinological Series 5. London, 1957. This work purported to show that a Roman legion that had been part of the army of Marcus Licinius Crassus defeated at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 B.C. had settled in Northwestern China. The defeated legion, Dubs speculated, had been relocated further east by the victorious Parthians, for whom they fought in a battle against the Han. Defeated again, they were settled at a place called Liqian located in modern Yongchang County, Jinchang, Gansu province. Although this story has been seized upon by enthusiastic Chinese of the area and non specialist Westerners, at least two eminent Chinese authorities have shown that the notion has serious shortcomings.Erling Hoh. \\"Lost Legion,\\" Far Eastern Economic Review January 14, 1999:60-2 and \\"Do descendants of Roman soldiers live in Gansu?\\" China Daily, 7/31/1998.

Later teaching and activities Following publication of the first volume of History of the Former Han Dynasty, Dubs taught at Duke University and its Divinity School, Columbia and the Hartford Seminary. He also worked on the Chinese History Project of the Institute of Pacific Relations with Karl August Wittfogel at Columbia University. Finally, in 1947 he was invited to join the faculty at Oxford University, where he took up the chair of Chinese that had been occupied by eminent pioneer Sinologists James Legge and William Edward Soothill. He retired from Oxford in 1959 and subsequently spent the 1962-63 academic year at the University of Hawai'i and lecturing in Australia. He lived in Oxford until his death in 1969. As a person, Dubs was characterized by his generosity and his eccentricity. He was once described as a \\"Spinozan saint who had missed some of the bigger academic plums because he wouldn't press his pants\\" and offended some of the Oxford dons by parking his motorcycle in the hallway. Like some others at Oxford, he also dabbled a bit in the occult. But he was an erudite and respected scholar, and his former student David Hawkes remembered \\"was always able to relate what he studied as an academic with what he had lived through as a younger man and to remind us by anecdote or example that the ancient texts he taught formed part of a continuum with the living present.\\"David Hawkes. \\"Tribute to Prof. Homer H. Dubs.\\" At Professor Dubs' death, the material planned for the two companion volumes to the History of the Former Han Dynasty remained unpublished. A group of scholars reworked the manuscripts said to total over 1000 pages to replace the romanization and render it acceptable to an academic press. Responsibility for it was taken over by the Han Dynasty History Project at the University of Washington, where Wittfogel had gone after leaving Columbia. Unfortunately, at the death of the Han Project's director, Jack Dull, the manuscript still had not been published, and with the end of the project, the materials were scattered and some of them lost. Recently, however, the [Glossary] materials have been recovered and are gradually being made available on-line, as have been the three volumes of History of the Former Han Dynasty. Together with the already published materials, they constitute a nearly complete translation or paraphrase of the entire Han shu. Publications *Hsüntze: The Moulder of Ancient Confucianism.

He was educated at Felsted and Institute of Psychiatry, University of London (now part of King's College London). War service Stafford-Clark did war service in charge of Waterbeach hospital, Cambridgeshire at the home of RAF Bomber Command. He was mentioned in dispatches twice as a result of taking part in raids. He worked hard to change the prevalent public opinion that airmen were naturally suave, fearless men; he portrayed them as war-battered men pushed beyond the limits of human exhaustion. Career In 1954 he was appointed director and head of psychological medicine at the York Clinic, Guy's Hospital, with a consultancy at the Bethlem Royal and Institute of Psychiatry, Maudsley Hospital until ill-health forced his retirement in 1974. As a forensic psychiatrist, he testified for the defence in the much- publicized murder trial of Guenther Podola, who sought to evade his trial on the grounds of amnesia, and later in the case of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence. He gave a number of lectures such as the Robert Waley Cohen series, on 'Psychology of Prejudice; Christians & Jews' in 1960 and St Andrews University's twelve Gifford lectures in 1976. Books His bestselling book Psychiatry To-day (1951) was followed by numerous other titles including Psychology for Students (1964) which had seven reprints; these two named volumes are widely regarded as standard texts for all University psychology courses. He also wrote ' (1965), another best-seller. His son Max Stafford-Clark is a prominent theatre director. References * Henry R.

The majority of the species are centered on the Mediterranean and it is the second largest hoverfly genus in Europe with more than 50 European species. It is distributed over the Palaearctic and Afrotropical realms, with most European species occurring in Southern and Eastern Europe. The centre of distribution of this genus appears to be Turkey, where about 65 species have been recorded. Some species occur in Africa (Morocco through East Africa and Ghana to South Africa) and the middle East, as far as Pakistan. Given the rate at which new species have been recorded over the past decades, the worldwide number of species could exceed 200. The larvae feed on the bulbs or rhizomes of monocotyledons. One of the more common species in the genus, Merodon equestris is known as the Narcissus bulb fly, greater bulb-fly, large bulb fly or large Narcissus fly.

While Public Policy schools comprise the main component of PolicyNet’s membership, PolicyNet is also home to over 1370 individual members from around the world. Programs and Activities More than simply a networking site, PolicyNet promotes engagement among its users by providing access to an online library which houses a large collection of policy related literature; compiling information on public policy related news, employment opportunities and online media; and by releasing monthly newsletters which apprise members of new developments on PolicyNet, important issues in public policy and on the activities of its partners. Two of the more successful and interactive features of PolicyNet have been Blogging Program and Virtual Seminar Series. The PolicyNet Blogger Program invites members to create an online blog and make postings on public policy related issues that can be viewed and responded to by other users. As part of this program, PolicyNet also employs a select number of Featured Bloggers on short-term contacts who are paid for their participation. In 2008 PolicyNet launched a Virtual Seminar Series to encourage an international dialogue and debate on public policy issues by connecting students from around the world with distinguished faculty residing at PolicyNet schools. Seminars are conducted in real time through the Australian branch of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), managed by the Crawford School of Economics and Government. Students prepare for seminars by reading several relevant articles from a list provided by the speaker and posted on the PolicyNet website. The speaker starts the session with a short talk and then responds to questions from students and encourages discussion among participants. To date, the PolicyNet Virtual Seminar Series has presented sessions led by several prominent public policy experts including: Anne-Marie Slaughter, Thomas Homer-Dixon and Zhiyuan Cui. Research Although PolicyNet is primarily a networking tool which fosters relationships among members, it has recently expanded its mandate and is now actively participating in research on public policy education. In 2008, PolicyNet joined with the Institute on Research and Debate on Governance (IRG) to create the World Observatory of Teaching in Public Affairs (WOTPA) project which seeks to “identify university level teaching programs in public affairs throughout the world, in order to analyze and compare them, make this information available to the public through a website and contribute to the debate on public governance.”WOTPA Objectives, http://www.wotpa.org/ 2008 References 1\\\\.

Terence Leach suggests a great deal of his influence stemmed from his social standing, for he was ‘the only person in his social sphere who showed any interest in the Methodist cause’.Terence R Leach ‘John Wesley’s Earthly Paradise’ Laece Books, 1993 However his skills as an orator were also well recognised throughout the county, and indeed throughout the country, and he was in high demand to speak at the opening ceremonies of Methodist chapels throughout England. He remained an active preacher throughout his life, even taking Methodism to Jersey, where his legacy is still well remembered. In 1779, Brackenbury constructed a Methodist chapel above the stables in the grounds of his estate in Raithby by Spilsby, Lincolnshire. Raithby Hall was also constructed by Brackenbury around this time. The chapel was completed before the house, which was just a ‘shell’ when John Wesley visited Brackenbury on 5 July 1779 to open the chapel. John Wesley was the founder of Methodism and a great friend of Brackenbury. Brackenbury was held in high regard by John Wesley and despite never being ordained, was appointed by Wesley to be part of the ‘Legal Hundred’, a conference of esteemed ministers who advised Wesley and provided guidance on the appointment of preachers. Wesley writes of his visits to Raithby and to Brackenbury’s home fondly, after a visit in 1779 he wrote that he ‘could not but observe, while the landlord and his tenants were standing together, how “Love, like Death, maketh all distinctions void.”John Wesley ‘Journal of the Revered John Wesley, Sept 13 1773 to Jan 2 1776’, p.152 In 1791, Brackenbury had just lost his friend and mentor Charles Wesley. He decided to leave Southampton, and take the first coach that drew up. By complete chance Brackenbury ended up in Weymouth, where he was told of Portland's darkness and immorality, although in reality conventional crime was rare on the island, and it was probably the unusual marriage and sexual customs that concerned those on the mainland. Within the space of a year Brackenbury and his friend George Smith had a large Methodist following on the island. In 1792 he had a large chapel built in the village of Fortuneswell, including the minister's house, entirely at his own expense. Brackenbury himself continued to stay on Portland for long periods, and in 1792 he rented a thatched cottage at Wakeham for meetings, and there the first Tophill Sunday Schools were held. Upon his death in 1818, his wife continued his work on the island. The 1792 chapel was later replaced with the Underhill Methodist Church, also known as Brackenbury Memorial Church. Family Robert Carr Brackenbury was married twice. His first marriage in 1782 ended two years later with the death of his wife Jane, who was aged just 24. He was remarried in 1795 to married Sarah Holland, also a dedicated Methodist. Sarah was very much Robert’s junior, and survived him by almost 20 years. Records indicate that Sarah continued her husband’s ministry after his death; the 1841 census lists her occupation, as ‘Cure of Souls Without Clerk In Holy Orders’. Despite two marriages, Robert Carr Brackenbury died without any children. Upon the death of his second wife, Sarah, his estate was sold, in an impoverished state, to the Reverend Edward Rawnsley (1816–1905). Death Robert died in 1818 and is buried in Raithby Church. Legacy Unfortunately few records survive of the life of Robert Brackenbury; his modesty demanded that all letters and papers be destroyed after his death.

Casablanca is Morocco's biggest city, principal port, and economic capital. The town of Casablanca was founded in 1515. It was an important strategic port during World War II and hosted the Anglo-American Summit in 1943. The city is served by Mohammed V International Airport. Casablanca covers the richest and most sophisticated aspects of Morocco life, style, and architecture. Casablanca boasts one of the most extensive and diverse displays of art deco architecture in the world. Economic overview Casablanca is the leading force in the economic development of Morocco and represents the key economic trading node for the African-European region. Casablanca is the industrial center of Morocco, with more than half of the country's factories, investment and commerce operations. Half of all of Morocco's commercial banking transactions occur in Casablanca. Casablanca's phosphate exporting industry is one of the main global ports and the administrative center for its trade. Casablanca also has the highest concentration of light and heavy industrial activity, food processing, textiles, leather production and tourism. Figures published in 2010 by the financial forecasting and research division of Morocco confirm that inter- regional disparities stand out when it comes to GDP per capita income. In Greater Casablanca, for example, it is on average 3.6 times greater than in Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate, at 25,918 and 7,257 dirhams respectively during the period 2000-2007. Economic data The Greater Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93 billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27 billion, approximately US$3.6 billion, come from the Greater Casablanca. 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca. One of the most important Casablancan exports is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmilling, furniture making, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, beer, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.

Life The son of William Daniel, an attorney, he was born in Colchester. He was educated at Felsted School and Christ's College, Cambridge, earning his B.A. in 1787 and his M.A. in 1790. He was never beneficed. Although he took holy orders in the Church of England, his name is not in Richard Gilbert's List of Beneficed Clergy (1829). He did receive an appointment as private chaplain to the Prince of Wales, in 1788, which he is thought to have retained for most of his life. Daniel indulged in sporting tastes to a degree which shocked even a tolerant age. A correspondent in the Gentleman's Magazine of 1802 wrote of him as \\"fitter to act the character of Nimrod than that of a dignitary in the church of England\\". At the end of 1833 he died in Garden Row, within the rules of the King's Bench, where he had resided for 20 years. Works Daniel's Rural Sports appeared in 2 vols. in 1801, dedicated to Joseph Holden Strutt, M.P., and became a hit with sportsmen of the beginning of the century. The book is a compilation with some original matter. Hunting, coursing, and shooting were fully described with plates. A new edition in 3 vols. was issued in 1812, and a supplementary volume in 1813, dedicated to the Marquis of Blandford, a miscellaneous collection with a bibliography of angling (from Henry Ellis). Ralph Payne-Gallwey noted the book as one of the earliest accounts of shooting wildfowl from a punt.

A view towards Grove Park History The barony of Grove, with the manor of West Retford, was part of the large property granted by William the Conqueror to Roger de Busli. It was noted in Doomsday survey as \\"Grave\\". From Roger de Busli it came to Gerbert (or Gilbert) de Arches, Baron de Grove, in the early part of the reign of Henry II. Gilbert's great granddaughter, Theophania, being a co-heiress, carried it to Malvesinus de Hercy in the reign of Henry III. The Hercy family built the original wing of Grove Hall. The estate continued in the Hercy family till Sir John de Hercy died in 1570 with no children but with eight sisters. Grove Hall was bequeathed to one of the sisters, Barbara, who had married George Nevile of Ragnall. It descended in the Nevile family until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when Sir Edward Nevile sold it to Sir Creswell Levinz, one of the Judges of the Common Pleas. Sir Creswell Levinz was succeeded by his son, William Levinz, who resided at Grove and was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1707–08 and sometime MP for East Retford and afterwards for Nottinghamshire. This William Levinz left a son, William, who alienated the greatest part of his inheritance and in 1762 sold the manor and estate of Grove, with its appurtenances, to Anthony Eyre of Rampton and Adwick-le- Street. Anthony Eyre's son, Anthony Hardolph Eyre, died in 1836 leaving two daughters, one of which, Frances, inherited Grove. She had married Granville Harcourt Vernon, son of the Archbishop of York. The property passed down in the Harcourt-Vernon family to Granville Charles FitzHerbert Harcourt-Vernon, who sold the house in 1946. The Hall The new entrance to Grove Park A large brick house in the Old English style, with gable ends and mullion windows, had been erected at Grove at a period which is not known, and had since undergone considerable alterations. During the wars between the Houses of York and Lancaster, the Hercy family, with their neighbours the Stanhopes, of Rampton, were active supporters of the House of Lancaster, and during the arduous struggle for superiority were frequently surrounded by dangers of no common kind; till at length Victory \\"To Tudor's brow transfer'd the gem, The long disputed diadem.\\" Afterwards, as a mark of their zeal, and as a remembrance of their past services, they each of them inserted in the walls of their respective mansions, a sculptured rose and crown, the device assumed by Henry VII and by many of his adherents. At Grove this device was placed in the house over a large Gothic window which lights the principal staircase. Sir Creswell Levinz and his son made some alterations in the house, as did Anthony Eyre after he purchased it, entirely altering the character of it. He removed the whole of the ancient roof and pulled down a considerable part of the south-west front, in the place of which, under the direction of architect John Carr, he built a suite of rooms of more convenient dimensions. In making this alteration, he took down a stone tower, which must have been built in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, under which were found a considerable number of the coins of that Queen’s reign. The lordship of Grove was extensive, containing about , part of which is covered with wood, and the rest is occupied, either in grazing, or to agricultural purposes. The situation of Grove Hall, is said to be the most elevated and picturesque in the Nottinghamshire; on all sides, the views are pleasing and extensive: to the east the levels of Lincolnshire appear \\"beautifully tinted with variety, the view of which, is backed with the noble promontory on which part of the city of Lincoln stands, whilst the minster rears its venerable head, and overlooks the vast Plains which extend themselves until the ocean terminates their bounds\\". To the west the view is equally extensive, the ancient forest of Sherwood, \\"from the numerous woods and plantations which rear their heads in every direction, reminds the beholder of ancient days, when the famous oaks displayed their towering boughs; this very interesting view is only terminated by the hills of Kinderskout in Derbyshire\\".

Until 1994 it was known as United Township Municipality of Suffolk-et-Addington. This farming community, north of Montebello, is often visited by cottage vacationers for hunting and fishing in the numerous lakes of the area. Geography The area is characterized by rugged terrain of the Laurentian Mountains, marked here and there by mountains that rise more than above sea level. Its principal streams are the Little Rouge River and the Suffolk Creek that feeds it, the first being a tributary of the Petite-Nation River. History General store in St-Émile-de-Suffolk in 1920 Suffolk Township (named after the county in England) was already on the Gale and Duberger map of 1795, but not officially established until 1874. Municipally it was part of the United Township Municipality of Hartwell-et-Suffolk until 1880 when the municipality separated and the Township Municipality of Suffolk was formed, taking effect on January 1, 1881. In 1885, Addington Township (named after Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth) was merged with Suffolk Township, creating the United Township Municipality of Suffolk-et-Addington. This county consisted of Vinoy, Namur, Saint-Émile, Lac-des-Plages and part of Vendée. In 1889, the Parish of Saint-Émile-de-Suffolk was formed. This name paid tribute to Émile Quesnel of Saint-Andre-Avellin, who had been particularly generous toward the early settlers of the area. Piece by piece, portions of the united township were detached to form new municipalities: Vinoy in 1920 (which became part of Chénéville in 1996), Lac-des-Plages in 1950, and finally Namur in 1964.

It gives its name to the nearby Metro station Saint-François-Xavier. History Altar A séminaire destiné à former des missionnaires à l’apostolat en pays lointains (seminary for foreign missions) had been set up on rue du Bac in 1637 by Monseigneur Duval, with an accord from pope Urban VIII, during the Counter Reformation. The seminary's oratory or chapel was built between 1683 and 1689, with interior decoration by Jacques Stella, Nicolas Poussin and Simon Vouet, and it was this chapel that operated secretly as a parish church for the area during the Revolutionary era when the area's actual parish church of Saint-Sulpice was shut down. In 1801 the chapel was attached to the church of Saint-Thomas-d’Aquin, which became the church for the Faubourg Saint- Germain, and the Missions étrangères parish was officially recognised and split from the parish of Saint-Sulpice in 1802, at which time its curé was abbé Dessaubaz. 40 years later, in 1842, the parish was dedicated to St Francis Xavier. However, the chapel soon became too cramped for the seminarians and parishioners to share and the parishioners began construction on a new church in 1861 under abbé Jean-Louis Roquette (curé of the church from 1848 to 1889), headed by Adrien Lusson then Joseph Uchard and paid for by the Ville de Paris. The chosen site was in the corner of boulevard des Invalides and a planned boulevard right across the district towards rue des Saints-Pères that would meet the Seine level with Pont du Carrousel. According to the principals of Haussmann's renovation of Paris, the new church would then form the end to this planned boulevard, explaining why its siting seems odd today, shifted over the boulevard and the hôtel des Invalides. Lusson began the works, but they were interrupted in 1863 and resumed under Uchard after Lusson's death. Work on the exterior was completed on 15 July 1874 and inaugurated at Easter 1875, at which point the interior decor was still incomplete. It was finally consecrated on 23 May 1894, the eve of Corpus Christi, in a ceremony presided over by François-Marie-Benjamin Richard, archbishop of Paris. Notable vicars of the new church have included abbé Louis Esquerré (from 1894 - founder of the Patronage du Bon Conseil), Georges Chevrot (1930–58) and Georges Derry (beheaded in Cologne in 1943). The parish now contains 24,000 inhabitants.

The history of the club is marked by several wholesale transfers of the football team to other cities. The club was founded in 1951 as Sportsverein Volkspolizei Vorwärts LeipzigGrüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag as the sports club of the Volkspolizei (English: People's Police, the East German national police) based in the city. The name Vorwärts was used in East Germany by those clubs associated with the armed forces, paramilitary organizations, and police. __TOC__ Football department =History= Following World War II Germany was occupied by the victorious Allies and a separate state – the German Democratic Republic (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR; commonly in English, East Germany) – emerged in the Soviet-held eastern part of the country. The formation of an independent East German football competition soon followed and the new first division DS-Oberliga (Deutscher Sportausschuss Oberliga or German Sports Association Upper League) was inaugurated with the 1949–50 season. In their debut season in 1951–52 SV competed as part of the first division which was by then known as the DDR-Oberliga. The club was renamed in December 1952 as Sport Klub Vorwärts der Kasernierten Volkspolizei Leipzig and in April 1953 the first team players were transferred en masse to Berlin to become Sport Klub Vorwärts der KVP Berlin, which continued to play in the top flight. The remaining footballers carried on under the original club's name and on 1 January 1955 the team assumed the place of SC DHfK Leipzig II in the DDR-Liga (II). In July 1955 the entire first team squad was again transferred, this time to SV Vorwärts Cottbus and the remaining rump side disappeared into lower-tier play. On 1 October 1956 the Leipzig team became an army rather than police club and took on the name Armee-Sportgemeinschaft Vorwärts Leipzig. They recovered to make their way back to the 2.DDR-Liga (III) in 1960 and after a division title in 1962 returned to the DDR-Liga (II) where they would remain throughout the decade. ASG bounced back after a last place finish and relegation in 1970 to win the Bezirksliga Leipzig (III) title in 1970–71. In 1973, two seasons after their return to second-tier play, they won their division and subsequently took part in a failed Oberliga promotion playoff. Vorwärts played one more season in Leipzig and in 1974 the squad was again transferred, this time to Dessau where they became ASG Vorwärts Dessau. Vorwärts Leipzig regularly took part in the preliminary rounds of the FDGB- Pokal (East German Cup) throughout this period. Their first appearances took place in 1957 and 1959, and between 1960 and 1974, they missed out on cup play only in 1961 and 1972. Their best result was an advance to the quarterfinals in 1959 where they were eliminated 0:3 by SC Turbine Erfurt. The Leipzig team's unusual history has left a legacy of teams linked to the original 1951 club including current day clubs Vorwärts Dessau and Frankfurter FC Viktoria, as well as defunct sides Vorwärts Berlin, Vorwärts Cottbus, and Vorwärts Kamenz. =Honours= * 2.

In 1900, she was beatified by Pope Leo XIII and was canonized in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Early life Anna Höss was born on 20 October 1682 in Kaufbeuren, in Bavaria, Germany, to Matthias Höss and his wife, Lucia Hoermann, the sixth of their eight children. Only three of the children survived into adulthood. She became a weaver, but her greatest ambition was to enter the local convent of the Tertiary Franciscans in Kaufbeuren, which occupied the old Meierhof of the town, in whose chapel she often prayed. As a poor weaver, however, her father did not have enough money to pay the customary dowry expected of a candidate, so she was not admitted. Monasteries of the Third Order Regular Unlike monasteries of the nuns of the Franciscan Second Order, known as the Poor Clares, nuns of the Third Order were completely local, living under the authority of the bishop of the diocese where they were located. The history of the Third Order of St. Francis—of which these women were a part—had a range of organizational models, in that many communities of religious women did not embrace the enclosure, but considered active works of charity, tending to the poor and sick, as part of their religious and Franciscan charism. Monasteries like that of Kaufbeuren were established to pursue the purely contemplative life, usually in an urban setting. The Order of Friars Minor, however, refused to accept spiritual supervision or responsibility for those monasteries which did not accept the strictest form of enclosure, such as the Poor Clares had. Thus the monastic communities of nuns of the Third Order like that of Kaufbeuren, who did not have the same connection with the public as did the active Sisters, were usually entirely dependent on the local clergy for spiritual direction and on local patrons for their survival. They were often marked by their precarious financial situations. Life in the monastery In 1703 the Mayor of Kaufbeuren, a Protestant, performed a major service to the monastery by purchasing a tavern adjacent to it which was often the source of disturbance to the quiet of the cloister, and donating the building to the nuns. He refused compensation but asked simply that, in return, Anna be accepted as a candidate. As a result of this intervention, the mother superior () of the monastery felt obligated to receive her, and Anna was admitted in June of that year. The superior, however, resented this and referred to Anna as a \\"parasite\\", since she was felt not to be contributing to the community. Nevertheless, Anna received the religious habit and took the name Maria Crescentia. The nuns were not kind to her at first, due to the manner of her admission. Once clothed as a member of the Order, Crescentia was subjected to a prolonged persecution by the unfriendly superior and some of the older nuns. They treated her as a servant, giving her the most menial tasks to perform. Although Crescentia was at first given a cell of her own, it was later taken from her and given to a new novice who had brought with her the customary dowry. Thereafter she had to beg the other nuns for a corner of their cells in which she might sleep. When she was finally given a place of her own again, it was a dark and damp cubbyhole. Nevertheless, Crescentia was allowed to profess vows and become a full member of the monastic community. She was assigned to serve in the kitchen and did the weaving for the monastery. Eventually, in 1707, a new superior was elected who was more sympathetic to Crescentia, and she was entrusted first with the important office of portress, and in 1717 she was appointed mistress of novices. At this stage of her monastic life, Crescentia was a prolific letter writer, who left many letters to people in various social positions, in which she gave them advice and comfort in their worries. Though by then she had begun to suffer from poor health, even paralysis, in 1741 she was elected as the monastery's mother superior, serving in that office until her death on 5 April, Easter Sunday, 1744. During her short tenure in this position of leadership of the community, Mother Crescentia led a renewal of their way of life. She counseled unlimited trust in Divine Providence, readiness to serve in community life, a love of silence, devotion to the Crucified Jesus, to the Blessed Sacrament and to the Blessed Mother. She encouraged the nuns to turn to the Gospels to develop their inner spiritual life, and was noted for the selectivity of her choices regarding candidates to the community. She justified this by saying: \\"God wants the monastery rich in virtue, not in temporal goods\\". Veneration The process of her canonization was begun in 1775. The secularization of monasteries which occurred in the Revolutionary upheavals of the late 18th century and the anti- Catholic policies of the German government during the Kulturkampf of the 19th century prevented the monastic community from proceeding with the process. Finally, in 1900, Mother Crescentia was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. She was canonized on 25 November 2001 by Pope John Paul II, along with three others.Homily of John Paul II at Vatican website Her monastery was then renamed St. Crescentia Monastery () in her honor.Franziskanerinnen des Crescentiaklosters in Kaufbeuren See also *Third Order of St. Francis References External links * Saint Maria Crescentia Hoss.

Personal life  Blezard's parents worked in one of Padiham's many cotton mills as weavers. Like many other local children, as a child he wore clogs, traditional for the area and not a sign of poverty. His tenor father sang semi-professionally. The mill-owner's daughter spotted his musical talent initially on the harmonium and persuaded the mill owner, Teddy Higham, to pay for piano lessons. In 1938 he left Clitheroe Royal Grammar School where he had played Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue, having won a Lancashire county scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London where he was a pupil of Arthur Leslie Benjamin.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1954 he married musical conductor Joan Kemp-Potter, whom he met at the Royal College. She died in 2001. He had cared for her after she had had a severe stroke in 1994. They had a son and daughter, known as Paul and Pookie. Blezard never stopped working to improve his piano technique. He lost his boyhood stammer and broad Lancashire accent in early adulthood but fought personal demons of doubt and worry all his life. He and his family lived in a rambling house just off Barnes Common, the living room dominated by his grand piano. Whenever he wanted to emphasise a point, he would leap up to demonstrate on the keys. He never retired and the night before he died he was performing at a charity concert in Barnes.  War work  He joined the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of the Second World War and became a Morse code operator in Wick, Scotland.  Postwar career  In 1946 he returned to the Royal College, and studied piano with Arthur Benjamin and Frank Merrick, composition with Herbert Howells, and orchestration with Gordon Jacob. He won the Cobbett Prize for a composition for a Fantasy String Quartet. He then wrote music for Muir Mathieson's documentary films, at Denham Film Studios near the village of Denham, and many others including \\"The Cardboard Cavalier\\", 1949, starring Margaret Lockwood and the film version of Noël Coward's play \\"The Astonished Heart\\" in 1950 starring Celia Johnson. Another was Beau Brummell, 1954, starring Stewart Granger, Peter Ustinov, Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Morley. In 1954 Blezard had arranged a performance for two pianos with Donald Swann and Sydney Carter. Swann introduced him to Joyce Grenfell, and she engaged him as her musical director. During rehearsals the same year for the show \\"Joyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure\\", Blezard married the conductor Joan Kemp Potter. The show lasted for over a year, ending its West End run at St Martin's Theatre. The piano was so bad that Blezard asked the management to buy an upright Bechstein at Harrods' sale. After this production, Grenfell decided that Blezard's piano skills were such that she no longer needed an orchestra as he could play any tune by ear, arrange it in any key or style and transcribe it on to paper without a piano. She wrote in her first, 1976, autobiography, \\"In Pleasant Places\\": > \\"He is compounded of compressed energy, employed at its best when he is > playing the piano, then it is wholly controlled. His familiarity with the > keyboard has the naturalness of breathing; and he moves in it with > confidence, dexterity and grace From 1954-1973 he composed many of Grenfell's songs and spoof operettas such as Freda and Eric. They performed on stage and television all over Britain, America and Australia. He could play her entire repertoire from memory, even though she often changed the running order at the last moment. To warm up before a show they would improvise fake Debussy and mock Schubert; he learned to play over hailstorms in Melbourne, cowboy films in Sydney, bagpipes in Auckland and the police radio on Grenfell's mike. Grenfell insisted on Blezard's getting equal credit, and would complain to the organisers if he was left off a poster or not mentioned in a review. She also pushed for higher fees, and persuaded the BBC to increase his fee from 10 to 200 guineas for two Cabaret television shows. Diana Lyddon, stage manager for Grenfell's 1960 British tour, said: > \\"The venues were often town halls. They were all under contract to provide a > tuned Steinway grand. As I was trying to fix the lighting, Bill would stomp > in and say: 'Bloody awful piano again'. The next time we toured together I > always checked in advance. At Grenfell's last performance, at the Waterloo Dinner in Windsor Castle in June 1973, she insisted she would only dine with the Queen if the Blezards were also invited. The Queen chose the programme, including Blezard's favourite \\"The Battle March of Delhi\\", a melodramatic Victorian song involving colonels, marauders and bugles. Grenfell supported the Blezard family in many ways: she bought them a dishwasher one Christmas; wrote birthday songs for their children, and contributed (unwittingly) to his son's first motorbike. Every summer, Joyce and Reggie Grenfell treated William and Joan to a week at the Aldeburgh Music Festival. For the royal opening of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967, Blezard and Grenfell composed a surprise song for Benjamin Britten who was so overwhelmed that he burst into tears. In 1957, he worked on two Royal Shakespeare Company productions with Peter Brook: Titus Andronicus and The Tempest. The same year he was musical director in London and New York for John Osborne's The Entertainer, starring Laurence Olivier as the failed music-hall artist Archie Rice. He performed the same role for Max Wall 20 years later. On the BBC2 launch in 1964, Blezard was a musical director for the children's programme Play School with Johnny Ball and Brian Cant. Anne Reay, one of the producers said: > \\"His job was to improvise music to the action of the presenters – anything > from a storm at sea to ice-cream melting. His interpretation was always > exuberant.\\" In 1965 he took over from Burt Bacharach as Marlene Dietrich's musical director and toured with her worldwide. He said: > \\"We had a row in every Hilton in Europe. But she always made up for it in > champagne afterwards.\\" He was with Dietrich in Australia in 1975 when she broke her leg on stage in her final performance. In the 1970s he worked on the TV adult literacy programme On the Move with Rolf Harris. He also worked with Elisabeth Welch in her one-woman show A Marvellous Party. In 1983 Sheridan Morley used Blezard as musical director for the show about Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence, Noël and Gertie, which began a long run with Joanna Lumley at the King's Head, Islington. Lumley said: > \\"It was a tiny cast in a tiny theatre with no dressing rooms but Bill helped > make it one of the happiest jobs I ever did. He was a life-enhancer who > treated every performance as if it was the Wigmore Hall\\". Blezard was musical director in 1986 for the musical Café Puccini by Robin Ray with Nichola McAuliffe at the Wyndham's Theatre, and then played for Honor Blackman in The Life and Times of Yvette Guilbert and Dishonorable Ladies. Blezard and Blackman worked together for the next 10 years, Blackman said: \\"William was my staunch support and brilliant accompanist. No one, but no one will ever be as good.\\" He also wrote numerous piano and chamber music pieces spanning his entire career which are representative of many genres, styles and touches including Sonatinas, Preludes, Scherzi, numerous character pieces and a set of variations written in his later life dedicated to the American pianist Neil Galanter. His own favourite composition, written in 1951, was the dark, quasi-mahlerian Duetto (for string ensemble), which his wife Joan Kemp- Potter also considered his most accomplished work. His orchestral music, in which the influence of his hero Maurice Ravel is easily detectable, particularly in its harmonic patterns, has enjoyed a significant revival since the late 1990s after a long period of neglect. Most of his major works are now available on commercial recordings. William Blezard was also a prolific arranger, who collaborated on several occasions with pop singer-songwriter Louis Philippe towards the end of his life.

The club is the successor to BSG Chemie Böhlen which played four seasons in the former East German first division DDR-Oberliga.  History  The original Chemie was formed in October 1952 as a merger of BSG Aktivist West and BSG Aktivist Mitte, which were founded in 1949 as BSG Benzinwerk and BSG Brennstoff respectively and renamed in July 1951. The first league Aktivist entered was the Bezirksliga Leipzig (III-IV) and stayed there until they won promotion to the 2. DDR-Liga (III) after a Leipzig district title win in 1956. They lasted for six more seasons until the 2. Liga was scrapped in 1963, when they were one of 64 teams regrouped in the Bezirksliga because a third-place finish for them was way short of a promotion playoff place. Aktivist won the Leipzig division in 1964 and 1966 but clinched one of two promotion places in the latter year's playoffs. Their debut in the DDR-Liga (II) was a disappointing one, ending in second from bottom and relegation yet they acted as a yo-yo club in 1967 when they earned their third Bezirksliga title and succeeded in the playoffs again. The club, renamed Chemie Böhlen in 1969, played ten more seasons in the DDR-Liga and they earned their historic moment when they advanced to the DDR-Oberliga for the first time ever on finishing the 1977 promotion round and the season in first place, after falling behind despite a division win three years earlier; their tenure in the top division of East German football was for only four seasons and bounced around between the top two tiers, winning two more group titles and promotions from 1979–82. Chemie played the last eight seasons of the DDR-Liga and won Group B before the league system dissolved. = Merger and refoundation = With German reunification underway, on 30 June 1990 BSG Chemie merged with Grün-Weiß Leipzig (formerly BSG Chemie Leipzig), runners-up in Group B of the final DDR- Liga season to becomeSachsen Leipzig, which is now defunct and replaced by successor clubs. Former members of BSG Chemie refounded SV Chemie on 17 July and their football team restarted in the Bezirksliga Leipzig (V) and won promotion to the Landesliga Sachsen (IV) in 1994 but went down after three seasons and withdrew after bankruptcy. Chemie subsequently joined the Kreisklasse Borna/Geithain (VII) and in 2003 went up to the Bezirksklasse/Kreisoberliga (VII-VIII) where they presently belong, except two seasons in the Kreisliga after voluntary reassignment.

Two 19‑year-old locals, Viktor Sayenko (, ), born 1 March 1988, and Igor Suprunyuk (, ), born 20 April 1988, were arrested and charged with 21 murders. A third conspirator, Alexander Hanzha (, ), born February 1988, was charged with two armed robberies that took place before the murder spree. On 11 February 2009, all three defendants were found guilty. Sayenko and Suprunyuk were sentenced to life imprisonment, while Hanzha received nine years in prison. The lawyers for Sayenko and Suprunyuk launched an appeal, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine in November 2009.  Murders  The first two murders occurred late on 25 June 2007. The first victim was a 33-year-old woman, Yekaterina Ilchenko, who was walking home after having tea at her friend's apartment. According to Sayenko's confession, he and Suprunyuk were \\"out for a walk.\\" Suprunyuk had a hammer. As Ilchenko walked past, Suprunyuk \\"spun around\\" and hit her in the side of the head. Ilchenko's body was found by her mother at 5:00 am. Within an hour of the first murder, the two men attacked their next victim, Roman Tatarevich, as he slept on a bench near the first murder scene. Tatarevich's head was smashed with blunt objects numerous times, rendering him unrecognizable. The bench was located across the street from the local public prosecutor's office. On 1 July, two more victims, Yevgenia Grischenko and Nikolai Serchuk, were found murdered in the nearby town of Novomoskovsk. On the night of 6 July, three more people were murdered in Dnipropetrovsk. The first was Egor Nechvoloda, a recently discharged army recruit, who was bludgeoned while walking home from a nightclub. His mother found the body in the morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street. Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and hit her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out. Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co- defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband. The next day, 7 July, two 14‑year-old boys from Pidhorodne, a nearby town, were attacked as they went fishing. One of the two friends, Andrei Sidyuk, was killed, but the other, Vadim Lyakhov, managed to escape after hiding in the woods. Later, on 12 July, 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko, disabled by a recent bout with cancer, went missing while riding his Dnepr motorcycle. His battered body was found four days later, with signs of a savage attack visible even after four days in the summer heat. Just days later, on 14 July, 45‑year-old Natalia Mamarchuk was riding her scooter in the nearby village of Diyovka. As she was passing through a wooded area, two men approached her and knocked her down. They then bludgeoned her to death with a hammer or pipe and drove off on her scooter. Local witnesses gave chase but lost sight of the attackers. Twelve more murders followed, often with multiple bodies found on the same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two victims were found each day from 14 July to 16. Victims were seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, the elderly, vagrants, or people under the influence of alcohol. Most victims were killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many victims were also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her fetus cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any victim were reported. Some victims were also robbed of their mobile phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their belongings left intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnipropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.  Investigation  No official link between the murders was made until the 7 July attack on two boys in Pidhorodne. Vadim Lyakhov, the survivor, was initially placed under arrest, suspected of murdering his friend. He was reportedly denied access to counsel and beaten by police during questioning. However, it quickly became clear that he was not responsible for his friend's death, given that the murder was connected with the developing murder spree. Lyakhov cooperated with the investigators to create sketches of the attackers. Two local children who had also witnessed the 14 July Mamarchuk attack, hidden in a tent just a few feet away, also provided a detailed description corroborating the one given by Lyakhov. A task force was quickly set up from Kyiv, headed by lead criminal investigator Vasily Paskalov. The manhunt soon grew to encompass most local law enforcement, and reportedly over 2,000 investigators worked on the case. The investigation was initially kept secret. No official information about the murders was released, and local people were not warned about possible attacks or provided with descriptions of the suspects. However, rumors of the attacks kept most of the local population home at night. Eventually, investigators selectively distributed sketches and lists of stolen property to local pawn shops, and soon, stolen property began to be identified in the pawn shops of the city's Leninskiy district. = Suspects = The three suspects Viktor Sayenko, Igor Suprunyuk, and Alexander Hanzha were arrested on 23 July 2007. Suprunyuk attempted to sell a mobile phone stolen from a victim in a local pawn shop, asking for 150 hryvnia (around 30 USD in 2007). Law enforcement agents tracked the phone's location once the shop's owner turned it on to check its functionality. Sayenko and Suprunyuk were arrested near the cash register of the shop. Hanzha was arrested at home, reportedly managing to flush other stolen mobile phones and jewelry down the toilet. The items were recovered, but all information on the phones was lost. The three suspects had attended school together, and by age 14 found some common ground. \\"Me and Igor [Suprunyuk] were both afraid of heights, and we were afraid we'd be beaten up by bullies\\", Sayenko stated during questioning. Suprunyuk sought advice on getting rid of their fears, which led the boys to stand on a balcony of their 14th floor apartment for hours, hanging over the railing. This reportedly had a positive effect on their fear of heights. Hanzha was reportedly the most squeamish of the three. He had a blood phobia, and even refused to bathe his kitten, afraid he might scald it. Suprunyuk suggested tackling the fears by torturing stray dogs. The boys captured dogs in a wooded area near their house, hanged them from trees, disemboweled them, and took pictures next to the corpses. Prosecution evidence included many of these photos taken by the suspects while underage. Some photos show the boys drawing swastikas and other symbols with animal blood, and giving the Nazi salute. In one photo, Suprunyuk poses sporting a toothbrush moustache, similar to Adolf Hitler's moustache. Suprunyuk was born on April 20, the same day as Hitler, and referred to this fact. A long video showing the three torturing a white kitten was shown in court. It takes place in their garage. The suspects fashioned a cross from wooden boards and nailed the kitten to it, then shot at it with pistols, placing foam and glue in its mouth to muffle the kitten's noises. When the boys were 17, Suprunyuk beat up a local boy and stole his bike, which he then sold to Sayenko. Both were arrested, but did not go to jail due to their age. After high school, Hanzha drifted between odd jobs, which included a pastry chef and a construction worker. At his arrest he had been unemployed for some time. Sayenko went to a metallurgy institute part-time and worked as a security guard. Suprunyuk remained officially unemployed, but made a living driving his green Daewoo Lanos as an unlicensed taxi. The car was reportedly a birthday gift from his parents. Some months before the murder spree, Suprunyuk — with the help of Sayenko and Hanzha — began picking up passengers and robbing them. A green Daewoo with a taxicab's checkerboard marking was often described as the vehicle used in the murders. According to the suspects' confessions, some murder victims were picked up as passengers in the cab. Hanzha reportedly participated in one where two men were robbed, and then declined to take part in any further attacks. Local media reported the suspects had wealthy influential parents with ties to local law enforcement. Vladimir Suprunyuk, Suprunyuk's father, in his interview to Segodnya stated that he had been employed at Yuzhmash as a test pilot, often flying with Leonid Kuchma, the future president of Ukraine, and continuing to serve as his personal pilot on domestic flights after Kuchma's rise to power. Local authorities, including deputy interior minister Nikolay Kupyanskiy, initially referred to the supposed influence of the suspects' families, but later denied the assessment, claiming that all three suspects came from poor families. However, Sayenko was represented in court by his father, Igor Sayenko, a lawyer. = Trial = The three men were charged with involvement in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived. Suprunyuk was charged with 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and one count of animal cruelty. Sayenko was charged with 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha was charged with two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in Dniprodzerzhynsk. All three confessed quickly, although Suprunyuk later withdrew his confession. Their trial began in June 2008. Suprunyuk pleaded not guilty, while the other two suspects pleaded guilty to all charges. Viktor Chevguz, Suprunyuk's original defense lawyer, left the case after reportedly being disappointed that his client's plea of insanity was not accepted. Lawyers for the victims' families argued that the level of care taken by the killers during their crime spree meant that they were fully aware of their actions. Prosecution evidence included bloodstains on the suspects' clothing and video recordings of the murders. The defense denied that the people in the videos were the suspects, claiming serious problems with the investigation, including at least 10 more murders covered up by the prosecution, supposed cover-ups of additional arrests of people with powerful connections who were released without being charged, even naming some of the additional people supposedly involved with the murders. The case was heard by a panel of judges chaired by judge Ivan Senchenko. The prosecution asked for life imprisonment for Sayenko and Suprunyuk, and 15 years of hard labor for Hanzha. Ukraine has no capital punishment since February 2000 after the Constitutional Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in December 1999. = Motivation = The prosecution did not establish a motive behind the killings. Local media reported the killers had a plan to get rich from the murder videos they recorded. One suspect's girlfriend reported that they planned to make forty separate videos of murders. This was corroborated by a former classmate who claimed he often heard Suprunyuk was in contact with an unknown \\"rich foreign website operator\\" who ordered forty snuff videos, and would pay much money once they were made. Regional security chief Ivan Stupak rejected the claim that the murders were committed to make internet snuff videos, saying that there was no evidence of this. Detective Bogdan Vlasenko stated: \\"We think they were doing it as a hobby, to have a collection of memories when they get old.\\" Deputy interior minister Nikolay Kupyanskiy commented \\"For these young men, murder was like entertainment or hunting.\\" At the trial, it emerged that Suprunyuk collected newspaper cuttings about the case. Some photographs of the crimes had captions added, including: \\"The weak must die. The strongest will conquer.\\" = Defense claims = The legal team defending the suspects consisted of three lawyers, one for each suspect. All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier. The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings. Hanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before the killings began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of Dniprodzerzhynsk. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing. The defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators but never the actual moment of discovery. The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects. In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders. Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he \\"did not murder anyone,\\" and when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge \\"asked him to sit down.\\" Igor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the \\"real killers\\", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired. Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. \\"But now these details are being covered up\\", Sayenko said in court. \\"The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the Militsiya, who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. […] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded. I also believe that the girl arrested on that day has since left the country and is now in Germany.\\" The defense team also claimed the prosecution withheld from the court information that exonerated their clients. Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, so all information on these crimes was removed from the case. Sayenko's defense claimed that he had a \\"psychological dependence\\" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader. They claimed that Suprunyuk repeatedly threatened Sayenko and that Sayenko feared for his life. Sayenko testified in court that he was in constant fear of Suprunyuk since the 7th grade. The strategy of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings. The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person was involved in the killings who could still be at large and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three suspects were unfounded. = Murder videos and photographs = The suspects' mobile phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera. The suspects were also found in possession of multiple photographs showing them attending funerals of the victims. They can be seen smiling and \\"flipping off\\" the coffins and gravestones. Evidence of animal abuse was also shown in court, with the suspects posing alongside mutilated animal corpses. The photographic and video evidence was shown in court on 29 October 2008, as part of a larger presentation of over 300 photographs and two videos. The defense objected to the presentation, claiming that the evidence was obtained illegally and that the subjects shown in the video and the photographs were digitally altered to resemble the suspects. When Sayenko and Suprunyuk were asked if they recognized the people in the photographs, they replied that they did not. Judge Ivan Senchenko responded by stating: \\"You are not blind.\\" Valery Voronyuk, an expert on film and video editing, testified that the video was not faked or altered. The court rejected all defense objections, accepted the prosecution's argument that the material was genuine and showed the suspects in the act of murdering their victims. = Victim in the video = The man whose murder is recorded in the leaked video was identified as Sergei Yatzenko from the village of . His murder took place on 12 July 2007, and his body was found on 16 July. Yatzenko was 48 years old. He had recently been forced into retirement due to a cancerous tumor in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother. At around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned Dnepr bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body. The fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera. The video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a shock site based in the United States and dated 4 December 2008. Ekaterina Levchenko, adviser to Ukraine's minister of the interior, was critical of the leak but admitted that control of videos on the Internet was \\"virtually impossible\\". Caitlin Moran of The Times watched part of the video and recalled her reaction in her column in January 2009. = Sentencing = Suprunyuk photographed with a hammer; the court described the motive of the killers as \\"morbid self-affirmation\\". On 11 February 2009, the court in Dnipropetrovsk found Sayenko and Suprunyuk guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced both to life imprisonment. Suprunyuk was found guilty of 21 murders, Sayenko of 18. They also received fifteen-year sentences after being found guilty on the robbery charges. Hanzha, who was not involved in the killings, was found guilty of robbery and sentenced to nine years in prison. Sayenko and Suprunyuk were also found guilty on the animal cruelty charges. Hanzha said of Sayenko and Suprunyuk: \\"If I had known the atrocities that they were capable of committing, I would have not gone near them at gunpoint.\\" The judge stated in the verdict that the main motive for the crimes had been a desire for \\"morbid self-affirmation\\". Referring to the accused, the court noted \\"the poverty of their emotional world, and their absence of interest in people and moral standards\\". The court's verdict was several hundred pages long and read out over two days. The lawyers for Sayenko and Suprunyuk announced their intention to appeal, saying that the authenticity of the photographic and video evidence was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The claim was dismissed by Edmund Saakian, a lawyer for one of the victims' families, who commented: \\"In theory a photo can be faked, but to fake a forty-minute video would require a studio and a whole year.\\" Larissa Dovgal, a representative of the victims' families, claimed other perpetrators involved in the crimes could still be at large. The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk repeated their belief in the innocence of their sons. Vladimir Suprunyuk claimed that Igor had been tortured to extract his confession, with the police covering his head and forcing him to inhale cigarette smoke. Speaking at a televised press conference, he cited irregularities in the investigation and said that the case against his son was false. Sayenko claimed that his son was a scapegoat and that the crimes were committed by relatives of senior officials. The parents stated their intent to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk also argued that the sentence on Hanzha was too lenient. An opinion poll conducted in Dnipropetrovsk found that 50.3% of people believed that the sentence was fair, and 48.6% believed that the sentence should have been more severe. In April 2011, a poll found that nearly 60% of Ukrainians wanted the death penalty available for serial killings where judicial error had been ruled out. = Appeal = On 18 August 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine referred the case back to the Dnipropetrovsk regional court of appeal. The move was welcomed by Igor Sayenko, who stated that it was a step towards clearing his son's name. Speaking at a press conference, Igor Sayenko and Vladimir Suprunyuk repeated their belief that the case was based on fabricated evidence. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said that the decision to refer the case back to the appeal court was procedural, and they were confident that the verdict would be upheld. The appeal was scheduled for 5 October 2009. In an interview with the newspaper Novi Most, the mothers of Sayenko and Suprunyuk said that their children were being treated well in prison. It was also reported that Igor Sayenko was considering setting up a website about the case. On 24 November 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the life sentences passed on Sayenko and Suprunyuk in February 2009. Hanzha did not appeal against his nine-year sentence. =Release of Hanzha= In April 2019, it was reported that Alexander Hanzha had been released from prison after serving nine years and is married with two children. Media =Chilean documentary= TV documentary series '. On 2 August 2010, the Chilean television channel MEGA broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ' (The Hammer Maniacs) and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ' (Here, Live). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnipropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case. The parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as snuff films for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun. The documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the filmmakers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but they declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies. The documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.  Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk  On 5 April 2011, two Russian youths, Artyom Anoufriev () (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin () (born 1993), known as the Academy maniacs () were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in Irkutsk. The attacks, which involved a mallet and knife, began in December 2010. Both were arrested after a video recording showing a female body being mutilated with a knife was found on a camera belonging to Lytkin's uncle, who had become suspicious. According to media reports, the youths were influenced by reading about the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs on the Internet. A psychiatric examination found them sane, and they told doctors they chose weak people as their victims. On 2 April 2013, Anoufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Lytkin to 24 years in prison.

He is the founder of two French immersion private schools, the Toronto French School and The Giles School. Born in Windsor, Ontario, Giles has a Master of Education and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto as well as a Bachelor of Laws from Osgoode Hall in Toronto. In 1954 he married Anna Por with whom he had three children. Achievements As founder for 25 years, headmaster of the Toronto French School, Giles introduced bilingual immersion education in Canada at the Toronto French School, which he founded and served for 25 years as headmaster. He also introduced and implemented the first early intervention programmes in Canadian schools. The success of his education model was instrumental in launching French immersion programmes throughout the North American public school system. Giles established the prestigious pre-university competitions, the Canadian Chemistry and Physics Olympiads, and started the first GCE Ordinary (\\"O\\") and Advanced (\\"A\\") examination centre in Canada. He assisted in the creation of the International Baccalaureate and established the first examination centre of the International Baccalaureate in Canada. He has participated actively in worldwide education communities including representing Canada at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th International Curriculum Conferences. Giles received membership in the Order of Canada in 1973 for his initiative in creating and directing the first private school in Toronto offering instruction in the French language. He also received the Queen's Silver Jubilee medal and the Commemorative medal from the Government of Canada. Giles is a Queen's Counsel and worked as a lawyer for many years. He has served as president of a chemical company, an economist in Canada and the Middle East, and director of various public and private corporations. His publications include Schools and Students: Legal Aspects of Administration, the play Mazaryk, as well as poetry and numerous articles in journals. Schools =Toronto French School= In 1962, the Toronto French School—one of Canada’s most prominent private schools—was created in the basement of the Giles household. Committed to providing their own children with the advantage of a bilingual education, Giles and Anna hired a French language teacher and started an extended home learning programme for six students. Rental facilities became necessary as the school grew and by 1966 six campuses were set up across the Toronto area, including one in Mississauga. Following the addition of the Mildenhall Branch in 1971 and the former Sifton estate in 1981, Giles set out to merge the geographically sprawling Toronto French School premises. In 1984, all of the Toronto locations were consolidated in one campus at Bayview and Lawrence Avenue East and, in 1995, a permanent home was purchased for the Mississauga campus. =The Giles School= In 1989 Giles opened The Giles School (then known as The Markham School for Human Development) with just a handful of students in an Anglican church in Toronto. The school moved to another location after one year and then again in 1991. In 1994, with increased enrollment, it opened a second campus to house senior students. In September 2008, the school merged its locations and moved to a permanent home near York Mills and Leslie in Toronto. The Giles School was founded on Giles’ philosophy of education, which is based on six pillars: early academic intervention, bilingualism, third languages, small classes, highest international standards and love. At The Giles School, children are not pre-screened on the basis of standardized tests. In an attempt to counter the exclusive process of private school student selection, Giles instituted a first-come, first-served admissions policy based on the conviction that his unique educational programme would improve the overall academic achievement of any child, regardless of his or her initial or apparent aptitude. Scientific Support The founding of the Toronto French School coincided with what later proved to be education-altering research in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and early childhood development. At the same time that Giles began introducing very young children to a second language with improved academic results across all subjects, the work of Nobel Prize laureates Dr. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel demonstrated that if the visual cortex behind the eye is deprived of stimulation during initial development, it will never be able to process visual information, even if the eye itself is not defective. Giles’ intuition was vindicated by the discovery that appropriate and targeted sensory stimulation is fundamental during formative brain development, or neural pathways will die and that the window of opportunity for cultivating optimal sensory processing is alarmingly brief. The discovery of this narrowly defined opportunity for bolstering neural pathway expansion has come to be known as the critical period in early brain development. It determines children’s capacity for language acquisition and higher cognitive functioning. During the 1980s and 1990s, interdisciplinary researchers, such as Canadian neurologist Dr. Fraser Mustard, illuminated the connection between optimal early development and durable social health. Giles’ longstanding educational philosophy was further borne out by the realization that early intervention (especially the first 3 years) has a lifelong effect on the brain’s wiring and sculpting, setting the stage for future competence and coping skills.

It is the coming-of-age story of 16-year-old Inuk (Gaaba Petersen), who was raised in the south in Greenland's capital Nuuk, and who is torn between the violence of his alcoholic parents and his dreams of creating an Inuit rock band. He is sent to a foster home in the north, where his foster guardian and teacher, Aviaaja (Rebekka Jørgensen) sends him to the bear hunter Ikuma (Ole Jørgen Hammeken) so that he may learn wisdom. But Ikuma had begun to doubt himself after his own world began to decline due to the effects of global warming. This begins Inuk's difficult initiation into manhood through a journey by dogsled where the seal hunt replaces video games. On his journey he meets and is attracted to the rebellious Naja (Sara Lyberth). He finally reconciles his life, but in doing so re-awakens the old injury that had affected the life of Ikuma.

Cambridge University Press, 2005.Shaw, I & Jameson, R: A Dictionary of Archaeology, page 136. Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2002.. This way of life is estimated to have persisted for approximately 4,000 years, and was characterized by hunting, as well as a unique approach to food gathering that incorporated the preparation and consumption of wild grasses and grains. Systematic efforts were made by the Qadan people to water, care for, and harvest local plant life, but grains were not planted in ordered rows. Sites from this period span from the Second Cataract of the Nile to Tushka, situated approximately 250 kilometers upriver from Aswan. In archaeological terms, the Qadan culture is generally viewed as a cluster of Mesolithic Stage communities living in Nubia in the upper Nile Valley prior to 9000 BC. At a time of relatively high water levels in the Nile, it is characterized by a diverse stone tool industry that is taken to represent increasing degrees of specialization and locally differentiated regional groupings.Darvill, T: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology, Copyright © 2002, 2003 by Oxford University Press. Large numbers of grinding stones and blades have been found with glossy films of silica on them, which could possibly be the result of cutting grass stems on their surfaces. There is some evidence of conflict between the groups, suggesting periods of invasion or intense inter-tribal war. In fact, about 40 percent of individuals buried in the Jebel Sahaba cemetery near the border of Sudan on the Nile river show signs of fatal wounds caused by projectiles, from weapons such as spears, darts, or arrows. The remains found in the cemeteries suggest that ritual burials were practiced. The Qadan economy was based on fishing, hunting, and, as mentioned, the extensive use of wild grain.

As defined by the War Department, this consisted of most of the Pacific Ocean and its islands, excluding the Philippines, Australia, the Netherlands East Indies, the Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) the Solomon Islands and areas to the south and east of the Solomons. The initial USAAF combat organization in the region was Seventh Air Force, which was originally formed in Hawaii as the Army Air defense command for the islands. After the Pearl Harbor Attack on 7 December 1941, Seventh Air Force retained the mission of its predecessor of the defense of the Hawaiian Islands and until the closing months of the war it maintained its headquarters at Hickam Field. The command however, deployed most of its combat units to the Central Pacific. As the war progressed, some Seventh Air Force units moved into the South West Pacific theatre and coordinated their activities with Fifth and Thirteenth Air Force units in New Guinea, Netherlands East Indies and Philippines during 1944 and 1945. In 1944, Twentieth Air Force was reassigned from the China Burma India Theater to bases in the Marianas chain of islands, consisting primarily of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. The Marianas airfields were considered as being ideal bases from which to launch B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan. The islands were about 1500 miles from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, they could be put on a direct supply line from western United States ports by ship. In September 1945, just after the Surrender of Japan, a few advance elements of Eighth Air Force arrived on Tinian and Guam. Eighth Air Force was transferred from England to be a second strategic air force in the Pacific War, with a mission to carry out B-29 attacks on the Japanese Home Islands during the planned Invasion of Japan beginning in November 1945. These advance units were reassigned to other stations in December 1945. Seventh Air Force operations focused on supporting Army and Naval forces in the tactical campaigns against Japanese forces in the Central Pacific, while Twentieth Air Force performed strategic bombing missions directly against the Japanese home islands.

Miller of Shoebox Pictures. It is based on the award-winning short of the same name. Chosen to participant in the 2009 Narrative Independent Filmmaker Lab & Independent Film Week in New York City, the film is one of only ten narrative rough cuts chosen by the Lab for its artistic vision and outstanding promise. Synopsis Log Line: A life shattering tragedy sends three people on vastly different paths to a similar goal of redemption and understanding. One year ago while on duty as a plain clothes cop, Julian Varone gunned down an unarmed teen. In that time Darralynn Warren, the teen's mother, has spiraled into a pit of despair, while his brother, Dre, has gone another route... ganglife. As for Julian, it's time for him to get back to work. It is a story about redemption, injustice of poverty, the cycle of violence and how these three lives, affected by a terrible tragedy, cannot find closure without the other. Cast *Aunjanue Ellis as Darraylynn Warren, the mother of a wrongfully slain son who must find it in her soul to forgive what has happened and be the best mother she can for her remaining two children. *Armando Riesco as Julian Varone, an NYPD cop who is facing the most difficult time of his life...getting back to work after nearly a year off duty due to an accidental shooting of an unarmed black teen. *Frank Vincent as Lieutenant Marino, the head of the police unit in which Julian has been transferred - does his best to give Julian some important advice as he acclimates back to life as a cop. *Michael Morris Jr. as Dre Warren, a teenager who is propelled onto a path of rage and loneliness by his older brother's untimely death – joins a street gang as an outlet and a way to connect with other people. Nathan Corbett as Curtis, Dre's former childhood friend – recruits him into the Black Knights gang – learns a hard lesson about the pressures of ganglife. *Tobias Truvillion as James, a man who carries himself with a serene violence – the multi-dimensional head of the Black Knights gang – carries the weight of being the protector of his community. *Annie Parisse as Lisa Varone, the estranged wife of tortured NYPD cop Julian Varone. Her life was torn apart with the tragic accidental shooting of Derek Warren, and now one year later she's forced to understand what her marriage has become. Production Writer/director Russell Costanzo's inspiration for the short film came out of the fascinating dichotomy between his Gramercy Park neighborhood in New York City and it being the home to one of the Top 12 Most Dangerous Schools in the entire cityhttps://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E3DF1331F935A35752C0A9629C8B63 (according to the New York State Department of Education). This statistic, coupled with a horrifying incident involving a pregnant woman, who, while walking past the school, was struck by a stool thrown out of a 6th floor window, sparked his interest. It made me think about what causes someone to act so violently, or how terrifying it’d be to attend one of New York’s toughest high schools. How do you learn? How do you progress? When I went to high school my biggest concern was having to get through Beowulf… these kids have to worry about getting stabbed! he says. After responding to a call for submissions by New York City based Clarendon Entertainment for short story ideas, Costanzo and Executive Producer Rodney Parnther honed the script and went into production on the short film in August 2005. The short took home the Best of Fest award at the 2006 Los Angeles International Short Film Festival beating out over 600 short films and went on to make its television debut on BET J. It was also awarded, Best Cinematography at the 2007 Vision Fest Film Festival. In June 2008 after securing the necessary production funds, Shoebox Pictures quickly jumped into pre-production, hiring the award-winning casting director Eve Battaglia and started securing talent and key crew for the film. Producer Melissa B. Miller has recently teamed up with Joseph Scarpinito and Scarpe Diem Productions to create a new web channel called Red Fish On Fire Principal Photography commenced in August 2008 and shot for 24 days in and around the New York City Area.

It can be used to determine the values of local atomic structure parameters on the basis of minimization between theoretical and experimental spectra. It is the program for the fitting and therefore it always uses external programs, for example FEFF8 or FDMNES, for fixed geometry calculations of XANES. In order to minimize the number of such calculations, which can be very time-consuming, multidimensional interpolation algorithm is implemented into the FitIt. Such approach has allowed also to develop visual control of the fitting procedure and it is possible to vary structural parameters by sliders and immediately see the theoretical spectrum corresponding to these structural parameters.G.

It is centred on the life of a 15-year-old lesbian Kim Daniels, who has moved from London to Brighton on the south coast of England, and copes with her infatuation with Sugar, a heterosexual girl. Plot From the beginning of the first series, main character Kim is adamant that she is sexually obsessed with her best friend, Sugar. Her strong feelings for Sugar motivate her to do anything for her friend, even when Sugar takes advantage of Kim's eagerness. Kim enters Sugar's world of casual sex, cigarettes, the over- consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs. The main theme of series 1 is for Kim to accept her feelings for Sugar even though Sugar is heterosexual. The last episode of Series 1 exemplifies the lengths that Kim is willing to go to for her friend. In the next series, Kim attempts to build a relationship with a young woman, Saint. Sugar has little time for serious activities in her life and there is little which causes her to worry. She spends the majority of her time drinking alcohol, socialising and having casual sex with men. In spite of their different backgrounds, Sugar and Kim soon become close friends. Sugar is accustomed to using her good looks in order to get what she wants. Sexy, sassy and street-wise, she becomes a bad influence on Kim. She encourages Kim to drink alcohol and eventually gets Kim mixed up in all kinds of situations. Sugar has an addictively electric personality that attracts people, especially Kim. It should also be stated that Kim's love for Sugar almost borders on obsession. Kim seems to be her only close friend and she rarely hangs out with any other girlfriends. She only has intermittent relationships with the men in her life. Sugar constantly teases Kim about her sexuality. At times, it seems as if she does not realise the great extent to which her words hurt Kim. In Series 2, Sugar is incarcerated in a young offenders institute. She is in custody because she stabbed a man who was attempting to rape her. This occurred in the last episode of Series 1, where it is the first time she breaks down in tears. Sugar, however, is then quick to take charge of the situation by stealing a car with Kim and driving to London where they spend the night in a posh hotel. Sugar exhibits a more vulnerable side of her when she tells Kim that she feels really lonely in prison. She reveals that Kim is the only person in her life who has not abandoned her since she has been imprisoned. In the third episode of the second series, it is implied that Sugar slept with one of the female prison guards in order to have her sentence reduced. Whatever the case, Sugar is then released from prison. This causes friction between Kim, Sugar and Kim's new girlfriend, Saint. In Episode 3 of Series 2, it is revealed that Saint is still friends with her ex-boyfriend, which causes some friction in her relationship with Kim. During Episode 5 of Series 2, Kim is caught cheating on Saint with rocker Montana which results in Kim overdosing on the beach. After several hallucinations, Kim repeatedly calls Saint apologising profusely before collapsing. When she awakes, Kim mistakenly believes Sugar saved her life. She later discovers that it was actually Saint who saved Kim's life. Sugar later confesses to Kim that it was actually Saint who saved her. Saint asks Kim to move in with her near the end of series two. Kim accepts although she has reservations. She confesses to Sugar that she does not want to move in with Saint because she always wondered what would have happened between herself and Sugar if the latter had not been arrested. When Sugar has convinced Kim that, although they 'have their moments,' they would argue too much. Kim returns to Saint and tells her that she will move in, leaving Sugar crying in a cafe. In episode 7 of series 2, Saint tells Kim she loves her. Character listing ;Kimberly Daniels:Fifteen-year-old Kimberly (Kim) is the protagonist of the series. She narrates her experiences, which focus primarily on her sexuality and her quest for love. She is a lesbian. ;Maria \\"Sugar\\" Sweet:Sugar, whose real name on the show is Maria Sweet, is a teenager who lives life without thinking of the consequences. ;Saint:Saint (whose real name is Sarah) is a young woman who works during the day in a female-orientated sex toy shop (called The Munch Box) and by night as a DJ at the CC (short for Clit Club). She is described the protagonist as attractive, assertive and confident. Saint was introduced in the first episode of Series 2, where she bumped into Kim on the street. Both noticed that here was a certain chemistry between the two and after several failed attempts at dating, they become girlfriends. ;Matt Daniels:Matt is Kim's confused and alienated younger brother who believes he is from a different planet. Matt is desperate for attention from his parents and others. He does not appear to have any friends, although this changes in series 2. He goes to extreme lengths to get noticed, even to the point of turning everything he owns blue including himself and his hamster. He also shows a lack of knowledge when it comes to sexuality. For example, at one stage he believes that he is menstruating. :As far as Kim is concerned, Matt is just her brother who wanders round with a goldfish bowl on his head. He completes a remarkable transformation into a goth for series two. He begins to experiment with cross-dressing. He even borrows Stella's underwear. In one episode Kim bribed him to stay in the house while she left to visit her girlfriend Saint while she was supposed to be babysitting him by trading her lip-glosses in return for his silence. ;Stella Daniels:Stella is married to Nathan and is Kim and Matt's mother. She seems to be more interested in having sex than being a mother. Stella rarely is seen to do anything meaningful and does not appear to have a profession. She often does not take the time to care for her children properly. Her cavalier attitude seems to hurt Matt more than Kim. :She spends a lot of her time trying to cover the tracks of her extra-marital activities from Nathan, whom she still loves. She attempts to justify her behaviour by stating that 'when you've had two kids and you've been living with the same man for 15 years the sex isn't that great'. ;Nathan Daniels:Nathan is described by Kim as 'half man, half pinny'. Nathan endeavours to be a good father but is completely ignorant of anything going on around him especially when it comes to his family. He comes across as being very nervous all of the time. He appears to live life in his own dream world where his family is stereotypical- his wife is faithful, his son is normal, his daughter is straight and doing well at school, and Brighton is the perfect escape from London. :Nathan has grown into an adult without realising, and has slowly become completely unexciting. He takes full responsibility for all of the cooking and the housework. He never asks Stella to help with the housework. For example, when he sees Stella attempting to wash her own clothes when she contracts scabies, Nathan is shocked because Stella does very little to help around the house. He has very nearly 'tidied himself out of a marriage', and does not have much luck when he decides to try to spice things up. When he makes his 'sexy dessert,' Stella ends up being admitted to the hospital. There were a number of supporting characters. Tom is Kim's next-door neighbour, the son of two gay men who has to deal with being called names himself. After telling Kim that he's not gay, she tells him she is. Mark Evans is the ex- boyfriend of Kim's current lover, Saint. He sparks a confrontation between the pair when Kim accuses her of \\"pretending to be gay\\". Beth only appears for two episodes of the first series of Sugar Rush, but makes a strong impression on Kim. When we first meet her we think she's trying to \\"un-gay\\" herself at the church meeting, but we later learn it is just to see 'who she can pull'. She brings a normality to Kim's life, and seems really interested in Kim, which in turn causes Kim to believe she's over Sugar. She is in fact not, and the last time we see Beth she is alone on the pier, after being stood up. Dale appears in seven of the ten episodes in Series 1. He is a handsome handyman who embarks on an affair with Kim's mother Stella. He was portrayed as a slob and it seemed like he had no real feelings for Stella and was just seeing her for sex. Anna is a beautiful womaniser who can be charming when she wants to be. She wasted no time in seducing Kim and wasted even less time discarding her after they'd had sex together, leaving Kim feeling used and humiliated. She is described by Kim as a 'psycho bitch.' Background/production There were 2 series of the programme, the first airing in 2005 and the second in 2006. Each series consists of ten episodes, each 30 minutes long, including adverts. Episodes do not have individual titles. Channel 4 stated that Sugar Rush will not be returning for a third series, despite its popularity with viewers and critics alike. Some rumours were that there was not a scheduling spot for it, that it was being removed because of the requirements for Big Brother 8, and because a third series was never originally planned. A decision had been made to allow new dramas to be made for each month in 2008. However, a spokeswoman confirmed that third and fourth series were never planned, and that the story of the girls had run its course. Hallinan and Crichlow subsequently spoke out about the cancellation, saying, \\"the show was an asset to Channel 4. I don't think Channel 4 recognises Sugar Rush was a brave move and did really well for the channel,\\" and adding that the cancellation, \\"was a last minute thing, especially the way we leave series two [i.e. with Sugar moving in with Kim and Saint and Stella's pregnancy], it sets things up for series three.\\" Cast information The main characters are Kimberly Daniels, her family and friends. Kimberly Daniels is played by Olivia Hallinan. Her father, Nathan, is played by Richard Lumsden. Kurtis O'Brien plays her younger brother Matt. Lenora Crichlow plays Maria \\"Sugar\\" Sweet. \\"Saint\\", Kim's girlfriend in series 2, is played by Sarah-Jane Potts. There are several supporting characters. Kim's next-door neighbour Tom is played by Andrew Garfield. Jalaal Hartley is Saint's ex-boyfriend Mark Evans. Laura Donnelly plays Kim's friend and love interest, Beth. Dale (Neil Jackson) embarked on an affair with Kim's mother Stella. Anna (Anna Wilson-Jones) seduced Kim and wasted no time discarding her Broadcast The first series was broadcast in 2005 on Channel 4, at 10:50 p.m, but would sometimes air later due to Big Brother 6 UK over-running, with the next episode on E4 afterwards, sometimes overlapping the Channel 4 broadcast. The programme was shown significantly after the watershed. The first episode of the second series was broadcast on Channel 4 on 15 June 2006, and the last episode was aired on 17 August 2006 on Channel 4, and on 10 August 2006 on digital channel E4. Series one currently airs on OUTtv in Canada. Re-runs are currently available in the UK, on the Channel 4 streaming service 4OD.

Collins English Dictionary. Retrieved 3 September 2018. (although a quarter-life crisis can begin as early as 18).The age you're most likely to have a quarter-life crisis. The Independent. Author - Rachel Hosie. Published 15 November 2017. Retrieved 3 September 2018. It is defined by clinical psychologist Alex Fowke as “a period of insecurity, doubt and disappointment surrounding your career, relationships and financial situation\\". Aspects According to Meredith Goldstein of The Boston Globe, the quarter-life crisis occurs in one's twenties, after entering the \\"real world\\" (i.e., after graduating college, and/or after moving out of the family home). German psychologist Erik Erikson, who proposed eight crises that humans face during their development, proposed the existence of a life crisis occurring at this age. The conflict he associated with young adulthood is the Intimacy vs. Isolation crisis. According to Erikson, after establishing a personal identity in adolescence, young adults seek to form intense, usually romantic relationships with other people. Common symptoms of a quarter-life crisis are often feelings of being \\"lost, scared, lonely or confused\\" about what steps to take in early adulthood. Studies have shown that unemployment and choosing a career path is a major cause for young adults to undergo stress or anxiety. Early stages of one living on their own for the first time and learning to cope without parental help can also induce feelings of isolation and loneliness. Re-evaluation of one's close personal relationships can also be a factor, with sufferers feeling they have outgrown their partner or believing others may be more suitable for them. Recently, millennials have occasionally been referred to as the Boomerang Generation or Peter Pan Generation, because of the members' perceived penchant for delaying some rites of passage into adulthood for longer periods than previous generations. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members returning home after college and/or living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations. Higher cultural blend also plays a huge part of this process with Asian and Hispanics tend to stay within family longer despite having a high or low income. These tendencies might also be partly explained by changes in external social factors rather than characteristics intrinsic to millennials (e.g., higher levels of student loan debt in the US among millennials when compared to earlier generations can make it more difficult for young adults to achieve traditional markers of independence such as marriage, home ownership or investing).Tom Anderson. Debt-Locked: Student Loans Force Millennials to Delay Life Milestones NBC News.com, accessed 3 April 2018Lou Carlozo (9 May 2016). Student Loan Debt: The Invisible, Incredible Drain on Investment. US News & World Report, accessed 3 April 2018 In film The notion of the quarter-life crisis is explored by the 1967 film The Graduate, one of the first film depictions of this issue. Other notable films that also do so are Bright Lights, Big City; The Paper Chase; St. Elmo's Fire; How to Be; Reality Bites; Garden State; Accepted; Ghost World; High Fidelity; (500) Days of Summer; Lost in Translation; Silver Linings Playbook; Vicky Cristina Barcelona; and Shaun of the Dead; as well as the musical Avenue Q, in the television show The Office, and the HBO television series Girls. The 2008 web series Quarterlife was so named for the phenomenon. Other movies exploring the quarter-life crisis include: Tiny Furniture, The Puffy Chair, Fight Club, Stranger than Fiction, Greenberg, Frances Ha and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. A 2014 comedy directed by Lynn Shelton titled Laggies delves into the complexities of a quarter-life crisis. In music The 2003 John Mayer single \\"Why Georgia\\" explores the concept of a quarter-life crisis. The song was based upon John Mayer's experiences during this age period, when he moved to Georgia. The 1975 Fleetwood Mac song \\"Landslide\\", written by Stevie Nicks in her late twenties, explores many of the self-doubts and fears of the quarter-life crisis, at a time when Nicks professed to be uncertain about her musical career and her romantic life. English indie rock band Spector's song \\"True Love (For Now)\\", the opening track to their 2012 album Enjoy It While It Lasts, references a quarter-life crisis. \\"20 Something\\", the final track on SZAs 2017 album Ctrl, delves into the many insecurities she experienced in her twenties, both personal and professional, and the urgency she felt to make the most of her life before entering into mature adulthood.
