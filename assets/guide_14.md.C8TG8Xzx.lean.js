He was born in Tottenham, London. Somerset career Foster was a tall, slim right-arm fast-medium bowler with a whippy bowling action and a tail-end right-handed batsman. A graduate of the Haringey Cricket College in north London, Foster had one match for Middlesex's second eleven before joining Somerset for the 1986 season. He made his first-class debut towards the end of the season, opening the bowling in a rain-ruined match against Sussex with Joel Garner. Foster was not picked for Somerset's first team for the first half of the 1987 season, but played several times after that, and also made his one-day cricket debut. In 1988, he was a fairly regular member of the first-class team, and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he \\"offered promise for the future\\". The 13 first-class matches that year would be the most in any single season of Foster's career, and the 28 first-class wickets was also a personal high. His best bowling, though, was a return of four wickets for 46 against Worcestershire, and he did not take five wickets in an innings in his Somerset first-class career. In 1989, Foster played regularly in the one-day team, but had fewer first-class matches and at the end of the season he was not re-engaged by Somerset. Finding another county side At the start of the 1990 cricket season, Foster was out of a job. He played a couple of second eleven matches for Surrey early in the season and then one for Derbyshire later on. Derbyshire's opponents in this final match were Glamorgan and although Foster was not notably successful in the game, he was offered a contract by Glamorgan for the 1991 season. Glamorgan cricketer As at Somerset, Glamorgan used Foster largely as a back-up to the main opening bowlers, Steve Watkin and Mark Frost, and he played in less than 10 first-class matches in each of the two seasons he spent there. His biggest success as a bowler came in his first County Championship match for Glamorgan, against Somerset, when he took six first innings wickets for 84 runs. There was a second five-wicket innings for Foster the following season, five for 87 in the match against Durham. But this proved to be Foster's final first-class match: at the end of the season, he left Glamorgan \\"by mutual consent\\". Later career As in 1990 when he had left Somerset, Foster spent time after leaving Glamorgan seeking a further county, and he appeared in a second eleven match for Essex. In 1994, however, he joined Berkshire in the Minor Counties and in the 1995 season played one final List A match when Berkshire played Surrey in the first round of the NatWest Trophy; in this match, batting at No 11, he scored 21, his highest score in all forms of the senior game.

Craighill Margaret Dorothea Craighill was born October 16, 1898 in Southport, North Carolina. She was the daughter of Colonel William E. Craighill and Mrs. Mary (Wortley Montague Byram) Craighill. Craighill was a third generation officer following in the footsteps of her grandfather, Brigadier General William Price Craighill, and her father. Both men graduated from the United States Military Academy, commonly referred to as West Point, in West Point, New York. On May 28, 1943, she became the first woman commissioned officer in the United States Army Medical Corps. Major Craighill served through World War II and afterward worked with the Veterans Administration. She died on July 20, 1977, in Southbury, Connecticut. Early career Craighill received her Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Science (MS) degrees from the University of Wisconsin, finishing her studies in 1921. Upon graduation, she briefly worked as a physiologist with the Chemical Warfare Department of the United States Army at Edgewood Arsenal in Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. After this, Craighill enrolled at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and graduated with her Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1924. During the years of 1925 and 1926 she was an Assistant Instructor of Pathology at Yale University. After 1926, Craighill served as an assistant resident of Gynecology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland until 1928. After leaving Johns Hopkins, Craighill worked as an assistant surgeon under Dr. J. A. McCreery at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, New York. At the same time, she also privately practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Greenwich, Connecticut, and held a position as an assistant surgeon and attending gynecologist at Greenwich Hospital. She stayed at Bellevue and Greenwich until 1937. In 1940 Craighill became the Dean of the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMC) in Philadelphia. In 1941, Craigill proposed a progressive plan that included curriculum, relationships between students and faculty, and the conduct of the teaching hospital. Simultaneously, Craighill was an assistant gynecologist and obstetrician at Philadelphia General Hospital. During her tenure as dean, Craighill was responsible for widespread reform throughout the college that included the curriculum, the teaching hospital, and student-faculty relations. In 1943, Craighill requested a leave of absence from the college to enter the military. World War II After President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Sparkman-Johnson Bill, which allowed women to enlist in the army and navy Medical Corps, Craighill signed up. On May 28, 1943, she became the first woman commissioned officer in the United States Army Medical Corps. Major Margaret D. Craighill, the first woman Medical Corps officer, with Dr. Elizabeth Garber (left), a WAAC on the hospital staff at Fort Des Moines. Both were sworn into the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army. Craighill was assigned as the Women's Consultant to the Surgeon General of United States Army commanding the Women's Health and Welfare Unit and liaison duty with the Women's Army Corps (WAC). During her military service, she was responsible for inspection of the field conditions for all women in the United States Army. This included providing medical care after enlistment, and recommending hygiene courses and other preventative measures, as well as establishing the standards for screening applicants into the Women's Army Corps and for Women's Army Corps medical care. She also met with a board of army doctors to create set standards of acceptability, and these were shortly published. Craighill was also responsible for advising the assignment of women medical officers. She recommended that women be assigned positions that were based on their professional qualifications rather than on their gender. In 1944–1945, Craighill conducted an inspection tour which took eight and half months to complete and carried her to areas all around the world. Over the course of her military career, Craighill traveled roughly 56,000 miles to places such as Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). She proved that women could survive multiple types of climates and were just as suited as men for the military. One of the first things she set out to do was discover the cause of medical errors. Unfortunately, the problem was that most locations were simply not providing medical care. In fact, gynecological conditions were often overlooked because the same examination given to men was used on women. Craighill at once secured that gynecological and psychiatric examinations were to be given to every Women's Army Corps applicant. Craighill pushed to have at least one consultant in gynecology and obstetrics to be appointed by the Office of the Surgeon General, but she was unsuccessful and these specific matters were instead handled by Surgical Services. During her time was the Woman's Consultant, Craighill also documented pregnancy rates in women in the WAC, as well as terminated pregnancy rates. Craighill suggested that women who had abortions should be retrained in the corps instead of dishonorably discharged. Craighill argued that an abortion does not suggest that the woman has an undesirable character, nor does it mean that she will be a bad influence in the Army. Craighill was also interested in the mental state of women in the military. At the time of her appointment, there was no research done on the analysis of women with psychiatric disorders that could possibly result in them being rejected from the military. She visited Army training hospitals and observed that inadequate, or even no mental health screenings at all, were being conducted for female recruits. In an attempt to solve this reoccurring issue, Craighill stressed the importance of giving psychiatric examiners a standard and definitive instructions for evaluating mental health. She also requested that mental health units were set up in WAC training centers to improve the performance of psychiatric examiners. These requests were not placed into effect until the spring of 1944 when Colonel William C. Menninger was appointed as the head of the Surgeon General's Neuropsychiatric Division. For her distinguished service in World War II, Craighill was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Legion of Merit. Post-war On April 8, 1946, Craighill separated from the United States Army and returned briefly to the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Craighill resigned from the college after an unsuccessful attempt to merge medical classes with Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia to introduce co- education at her female medical school. Craighill's rejected proposal requested that Jefferson Medical College accept at least 20 percent female students because she believed that the Women's Medical College would not be able to financially provide an excellent medical education to women. In 1946, she accepted a surgical position with the Veterans Administration (VA) at Winter Veterans Hospital in Topeka, Kansas, and resided as chief of the psychosomatic section of the Winter VA Hospital from 1948 to 1951. During her tenure, Craighill also served as Chief Consultant of the Medical Care of Women Veterans. This position was the first of its kind within the Veterans Administration. She was responsible for the oversight of the medical care of women veterans, along with nine other branch section chiefs stationed around the country. In 1946, Craighill went back to school, under the G.I. Bill, to study psychiatry at the Menninger Foundation School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas. At Menninger, she was a member of their first class. Craighill also graduated from the New York Institute of Psychoanalysis in 1952. From 1951 to 1960, Craighill began her own private practice in medicine and psychoanalysis in New Haven, Connecticut. Craighill also served as the chief psychiatrist in residence at the Connecticut College for Women in New London. She wrote many publications over the psyche of women in the army and one, in particular, was titled Psychiatric Aspects of Women Serving in the Army. In this, she differentiates between two categories: the nurses and the Women's Army Corps. Margaret D. Craighill died at the age of 78 on July 20, 1977, at her home in Heritage Village, Southbury, Connecticut. She never had children and was the widow of Dr. James Vickers and Alexander S. Wotherspoon.

Biography According to the United States federal government, Kalashov is a \\"key member\\" of the criminal syndicate known as \\"the Brothers' Circle.\\" In June 2005, Spanish authorities launched \\"Operation Wasp\\" targeting 30 members of the Brothers' Circle, resulting in the seizure of 800 bank accounts, luxury villas and cars. Kalashov fled to the United Arab Emirates, where he was arrested in 2006. He is the most senior member of the Russian mafia to have been arrested outside of Russia. He was subsequently extradited to Spain and found guilty of money laundering and racketeering in 2009. In June 2010, he was sentenced to seven- and-a-half years in prison and fined €20 million. In 2011, his sentence was increased to nine years in prison and fine increased to €22.5 million. In September 2010, a Spanish court approved the extradition of Kalashov back to Georgia, where he had been found guilty in absentia of kidnapping and other crimes and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was allowed to appeal his extradition to the Spanish Supreme Court. On 27 October 2014, the Spanish court ruled that he would be expelled to Russia but not extradited to Georgia. It was unclear why the court sent him to Russia, where he also has citizenship, instead of extraditing him to Georgia to serve his sentence.

Milam (October 22, 1884 – August 23, 1963) held many positions and made many contributions to the field of American library science. He was noted in an issue of American Libraries as one of the one hundred \\"most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\". Kniffel, L., McCormick, E. & Sullivan, P. Dec. 1999, p.44 Known mostly for his lengthy career at the American Library Association (1920–1948), he served as a leader in the association and earned the title “Mr. ALA”.Kniffel, McCormick & Sullivan, Dec. 1999, p.44 Mentioned throughout the pages of A History of the American Library Association 1876-1972, Milam has proved to be an influential figure in his long history at the ALA and in the field of librarianship.Thomison, 1978 He was at the forefront in providing ideas, public relations strategies, services throughout World War I and World War II, and work in the international field. Personal life Although Milam was born in Kansas, he had roots in Oklahoma as he spent his childhood there.Sullivan, 1976, p.49 He grew up on a family farm and was related to Benjamin Milam, known for leading troops into San Antonio in the \\"settlers' 1835 revolt against Mexico\\".Sullivan, 1976, p.49-50 He married Nell Robinson in May 1910 and they adopted a daughter, Margery, in 1914.Sullivan, 1976, p.70-71 They eventually had a child in 1918, and named her Mary.Sullivan, 1976, p.88 Although he was a very busy man, he recorded his pastimes such as gardening and fishing in the diary he kept while he was at the UN library.Dale, 1976 Education and early career Milam attended New York State Library School, established by Melvil Dewey, after he completed a major in English at the University of Oklahoma.Sullivan, 1976, p.61, 57-58 He began to search for a career and finally landed a job at the library at Purdue University.Sullivan, 1976, p.65 He took positions following this one on the Indiana Public Library Commission and later as director of the Birmingham Public Library.Sullivan, 1976, p.66, 70 At the Birmingham Public Library he was able to promote the value of public libraries to the public, raise funds, and expand the library system drastically to six branches.Thomison, 1978, p.84-85 He would use the skills he gained through these positions to become a leader in the ALA. War time World War I saw many changes in ways of life and in librarianship as well. In 1917, Milam put his career at the Birmingham Public Library on hold in order to be a part of the Library War Service.Sullivan, 1976, p.80 This organization was labeled as one of the “Seven Sisters” in wartime, in a similar category with organizations that provided services to those involved with the war.Sullivan, 2004, p.1 Camp libraries were set up for those serving overseas, and librarians agreed that they played a pivotal role in educating the public and establishing national identity.Kelly, Fall 2003 Herbert Putnam, director of the organization, traveled overseas in December 1918 and placed Milam in the position of interim director, though he would later become permanent director.Sullivan, 1976, p.82 He was responsible for the general operating of the organization and had a considerable number of tasks related to local and overseas co-ordination. Milam proved to be a central figure in the wartime effort, and the Library War Service did much for librarians in the areas of exposure and funding.Steilow, Fall 1990, p.516 Following the war, Milam wanted to ensure that the progress and exposure libraries and librarianship had gained would remain, and he became director of the \\"Enlarged Program\\" in 1919. Milam had believed that this program would \\"continue on that scale to the glory of libraries and the ALA\\", but funding was a major issue and they were unable to maintain the program. During World War II and while with the ALA, Milam began to strategize and develop plans for the period following the war.Sullivan, 1976, p.138 He worked with a number of individuals to provide figures which illustrated that the field of library science would be able to employ many librarians and ex- servicemen and women following the war. Around the time, Milam was especially outspoken, sharing his opinions on policies with the government and providing suggestions to the Librarian of Congress.Stielow, Fall 1990, p.518 American Library Association (1920-1948) Milam proved to be a pivotal figure in the American Library Association, not only because of his long career there, but because ALA presidential terms only lasted a year.Sullivan, 1976, p.98 Therefore, the secretary and executive secretary kept the momentum going and the association would essentially rest on his shoulders. He was able to make recommendations to the executive board and other committees within the Association, showing an unprecedented amount of leadership throughout his time there.Sullivan, 1976, p.101 Peggy Sullivan outlines that many of Milam's ideas or proposals would end up in the minutes of executive meetings, followed by the statement \\"at the recommendation of the secretary.\\" Milam focused his efforts on the areas of personnel, finances and fundraising, aid from the federal government, and public relations.Sullivan, 1976 Notably, he pushed for pensions and annuities for the staff, and was generally successful.Sullivan, 1976, p.130-131, Ch.3 The end was bittersweet due to criticisms of his work toward the end of his ALA career.Thomison, 1978, p.176 He was eventually nominated for president of the ALA in the year following his resignation, 1949, but the whole situation would prove to be an embarrassment due to the previous criticisms, and he was not elected.Sullivan, 1976, Ch.3 Milam's career at the ALA offered him many opportunities to work and attend conferences abroad and in Latin America.Sullivan, Fall 2004, p.1 As part of the International Relations Office at the ALA, he went on several trips visiting and getting to know the people and the libraries abroad. He worked closely with Sarah C.N. Bogle, director of the American Library in Paris education program, for a number of years,Thomison, 1978, p.94 and considered the library his office while traveling in Paris.Sullivan, 1976, p.196 International work with the ALA had developed as an area of interest for him, and when the United Nations position was offered to him, it is not surprising that he took interest. United Nations Library (1948–1950) When Milam was offered a position at the United Nations Library during the criticism he was facing at the ALA,Thomison, 1978, p.178-179 he weighed the pros and cons of accepting the position, and accepted.Dale, 1976, p.xiii With the official title of “Director of the Division of Library Services”, he focused on “his chief concerns” of “budget and personnel”.Dale, 1976, p.xii,xiii This was probably due to his successes in these areas in his previous positions. He and the UN library had identified problem areas such as organization within the library and within personnel, and Milam developed solutions.Sullivan, 1976, p.315 He wrote about these experiences in the personal diary he kept throughout his time in the position from 1948 to 1950. Dale argues that “his arrival marked the beginning of two of the most exciting years in the history of the United Nations Library.” Milam had much to offer the United Nations Library, and certainly left his mark in the profession of library science throughout his career. He respectfully resigned in order to care for his ill wife in 1950,Sullivan, 1976, p.320 but he continued to be a prominent figure in the field until his death in the summer of 1963.Sullivan, 1976, p.314 Notes  References  *Dale, D.C.

Hertz pioneered the first targeted cancer therapies. Hertz is called the father of the field of theranostics, combining diagnostic imaging with therapy in a single chemical substance. Early life and education Saul Hertz was born on April 20, 1905, to father Aaron Daniel (A.D.) Hertz and mother Bertha Hertz in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Jewish immigrants from what is currently Golub-Dobrzyń in Poland. A.D. Hertz was a successful real estate developer. The Hertzs raised their seven sons according to Orthodox traditions. Saul Hertz attended public school and went on to graduate from the University of Michigan. He received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1929, at a time when there were strict quotas for non-legacy students. Hertz completed his internship and residency at Cleveland's Mount Sinai Hospital, which had been established to serve Cleveland's East side Jewish population. Early studies with radioactive iodine Hertz joined the Thyroid Clinic and Metabolism Laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1931. Although initially a volunteer, shortly thereafter, Hertz became Chief of the Thyroid Clinic, serving in this capacity from 1931-1943. Hertz was aware that iodine was readily taken up by the thyroid gland, and he knew that certain elements could be artificially made radioactive. In 1936, Karl Compton, then president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gave a presentation at Massachusetts General Hospital on possible applications of physics to medicine. Hertz, having attended Compton's presentation, asked Compton if radioactive iodine could be artificially produced. Compton responded in a letter to Hertz on December 15, 1936, describing radioactive iodine.Fahey FH, Grant FD, Thrall JH 2017 \\"Saul Hertz, MD, and the birth of radionuclide therapy\\". EJNMMI Phys 4(1):15 doi:10.1186/s40658-017-0182-7 An alternative account of this encounter is that J. Howard Means posed the question to Compton about radioactive isotopes of iodine. At the time, Means was head of the Department of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Means also asked Compton if the Massachusetts Institute of Technology could produce a radioactive isotope of iodine. Compton's response was based on his consultation with physicist Robley Evans. In 1937, Hertz began a collaboration with the physicist Arthur Roberts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The purpose of the collaboration was to explore possible applications of iodine radioisotopes for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid diseases. Robley D. Evans of MIT and J. Howard Means of the Massachusetts General Hospital also had roles in the collaboration. Initially, Hertz and Roberts evaluated the effect of the isotope iodine-128 on thyroid function in rabbits. Roberts produced the iodine-128 by means of neutron bombardment, building on previous studies by physicist Enrico Fermi. Roberts also devised a Geiger-Müller detector for quantifying the amount of the radioisotope of iodine present in the biological specimens produced in the experiment. Hertz's experiment with Roberts involved studies of 48 rabbits. They determined in the study that the hyperplastic thyroid gland absorbed more of the radioactive substance than the normal gland. This proved that radioactive iodine could serve as a radioactive tracer in thyroid function.Soley M, Miller E,. \\"Symposium on Endocrinology: Treatment of Graves’ Disease with Radioactive iodine\\".Medical Clinics of North America 1948 32;3-17. The tracer procedure was critical for determining the amount of iodine the human thyroid took up so that the dosage of radioactive iodine could be established for therapeutic purposes.Hertz S, Roberts A, Salter WT. \\"Radioactive iodine as an indicator in thyroid physiology, IV: the metabolism of iodine in Graves’ disease. Hertz and Roberts pioneered the process of dosimetry that is the foundation of precision medicine.\\" Journal of Clinical Investigation 1942;21:25-29. Shortly after his 1937 rabbit studies, Hertz predicted the therapeutic use of radioactive iodine for treating thyroid carcinoma in a scholarly journal.Hertz, S. \\"A Plan for Analysis of the Biological Factors Involved in Experimental Carcinogenesis of the Thyroid by Means of Radioactive Isotopes\\". The Western Journal of Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vol.54 (December 1946), p.487-489, Greenwich, CT, accessed January 9th, 2019 Hertz also recognized at that time that prior administration of non- radioactive isotopes of iodine could inhibit uptake of the radioactive isotopes, based on his experimentation with rabbits. Therapy with radioactive iodine Saul Hertz demonstrates a detection device used in nuclear medicine, with colleague Doris Darby Hertz's initial studies were conducted with iodine-128. However, this isotope has a half-life of only 25 minutes, rendering it impractical as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent. Human application of the iodine radioisotopes required a more suitable radioisotope of iodine. In 1938, Glenn Seaborg and John Livingood had artificially prepared I-131 using the University of California Berkeley's cyclotron. With a half- life of 8 days, this isotope was better suited to practical medical applications than I-128. The building of the cyclotron at MIT for producing suitable isotopes was funded for $30,000 by the Mary Markle Foundation of New York City in 1938. The construction project was completed two years later in 1940. During those two years, the experiments with rabbits continued. In early 1941, Hertz administered to the first human patient a therapeutic dose of cyclotron-produced radioiodine (RAI), the patient suffering from Graves Disease, a form of hyperthyroidism. This clinical trial was at the Massachusetts General Hospital.Fragu, Philippe, \\"How the field of thyroid endocrinology developed in France after World War II\\", Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 1948 77,2:393-414. This administration was the first successful treatment of humans with an artificially produced radioactive material.Hertz S, Roberts A, Means JH, Evans RD. \\"Radioactive iodine as an indicator in thyroid physiology, II: iodine collection by normal and hyperplastic thyroids in rabbits\\". American Journal of Physiology 1940; 565 - 576. Subsequently, a series of 29 patients were treated in this way, and their outcomes were documented. The Journal of the American Medical Association published “Radioactive Iodine in the Study of Thyroid Physiology\\" with Hertz as lead author in its May 1946 issue. This article was a five-year follow-up study of the 29 patients, and it documented the successful treatment and safety of radioactive iodine for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The follow-up study established the use of radioactive iodine therapy as a standard treatment for Graves’ disease.Hertz, Barbara, Schuller, Kristin, \\"Saul Hertz, MD (1905 - 1950) A Pioneer in the Use of Radioactive Iodine\\", Endocrine Practice 2010 16,4;713-715. World War II interval In 1943, Hertz joined the United States Navy Medical Corps. He served as an adjunct to the Manhattan Project, working in an aspect of the project related to biology and medicine for furthering medical uses of atomic energy. After his return from military duty, Hertz learned that MGH's Earl Chapman (who had taken over Hertz's clinical trials) and MIT's Robley Evans, had submitted a scientific publication to the Journal of American Medicine claiming priority for the development of the use of RAI to threat Graves' Disease. Hertz, with his collaborator Roberts, submitted their own scientific manuscript. As a result, two scientific publications appeared side by side in the May, 1946, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, with the Hertz publication with Roberts appearing first in the issue of the journal.Hertz S, Roberts A 1946 \\"Radioactive iodine in the study of thyroid physiology.

Nuclear fission products in cancer treatment Interest in atomic energy for peaceful purposes was heightened as the Atomic Age commenced following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hertz envisioned broader applications of radioisotopes in cancer treatment stating, “My new research project is in cancer of the thyroid which I believe holds the key to the larger problem of cancer in general\\". Hertz established the Radioactive Isotope Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, in September 1946, with Samuel Seidlin of New York City as the associate director. Its purpose was to develop the applications of nuclear fission products to the treatment of thyroid cancer, goiter, and other malignant growths. After WWII, Hertz joined the newly expanding Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. There, Hertz directed the successful use of RAI in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinoma. Hertz worked with the government to centralize an agency to handle the distribution of radioactive isotopes for use by private enterprises working on approved projects. He advocated for the Atomic Energy Commission to produce iodine-131 in the government’s atomic piles (nuclear reactors) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which lowered the cost and increased radioiodine's distribution.Vincent, Donald. (1949 May 24). \\"Hertz to Use Nuclear Fission in Cure for Cancer\\". The Harvard Crimson, May 24, 1949. He made extensive studies of radioactive iodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer as well as in the production of total thyroidectomy in the treatment of certain cases of heart disease. In 1949, Hertz established the first nuclear medicine department at the Massachusetts Women's Hospital where he expanded his research to use radionuclides to diagnose and treat other forms of cancer. Hertz studied the application of radioactive phosphorus and the influences of hormones on cancer as displayed by isotope studies. Later career and influence Hertz's research was seminal in the emergence of the field of nuclear medicine. His research continued with his appointments as instructor at Harvard Medical School from 1946 to 1950 and as an attachment to the Nuclear Physics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1939 to 1950. The application of radioactive iodine in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease is the cornerstone of nuclear medicine. Barbara Bush, who was successfully treated with radioiodine, wrote to Vitta Hertz, his widow, “It is comforting to know that so many people are well because of the scientific expertise of people like Dr. Hertz.” News and Public Affairs Office of MGH. \\"50th Anniversary of 'atomic cocktail' to treat overactive thyroid gland\\". MGH Hotline 1991, Jan 31;1-3. In the 21st century, there is a significant rise in the use of radioisotopes to diagnose and treat cancer, in a field of nuclear medicine referred to as theranostics. Yttrium 90 (Y-90) and Lutetium-177 are being used to diagnose and treat neuroendocrine tumors. The use of dosimetry has its origin in Hertz's work. Alpha targeted therapy is a therapy for patients with neuroblastomas (brain tumors). The use of the protein called NIS, that is needed for the thyroid to take up the RAI in the treatment of thyroid carcinoma, is being explored to treat breast cancer. Additionally I-131 is being utilized in the treatment of stem cell replacement for leukemia patients. These are all modern extensions of nuclear medicine. Hertz died on July 28, 1950, at age 45 of a heart attack.

Cotton, camelid fiber, textile: Brooklyn Museum Detail of one shaman showing knife and head Museo Regional de Ica display both these skulls and the textiles The Paracas textiles were found at a necropolis in Peru in the 1920s. The necropolis held 420 bodies who had been mummified and wrapped in embroidered textiles of the Paracas culture in 200–300 BCE. The examples in the British Museum show flying shamans who hold severed heads by their hair. Description These textiles were made by South American people over a thousand years before the rise of the Inca. They are brightly coloured and show evidence of both a design and a style. The subject of these images are supernatural creatures or shamans who use their hands to hold severed human heads whilst their wings transport them like birds. These could be intended to represent being carried to the next world by spirits or that these figures represent the spirits themselves.Paracas textile, British Museum, accessed 27 September 2010 The people who created these textiles had a complex society. There is evidence of pottery, fishing, and farming. There were craftspeople who could make knives from obsidian, jewelry from gold as well as understanding all the complexities of weaving. Construction The textiles were made from wool and cotton. The wool is thought to have come from Alpaca or Llama. They had been dyed with natural dyes which unusually had kept their colour after over 2,000 years. The preservation of the colours is attributed to the dry conditions combined with the lack of damage which would usually have been caused by sunlight. The smaller fragments illustrated here have been taken from the large pieces of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies of the dead. These cloths were as long as 100 feet (34 metres) and would have required a significant organisation of a number of people to construct. The bodies were found in groups of 40 or 50 as if they were family vaults which had been used by several generations. One of the unusual qualities of the skulls that were found is that many of them had been deformed in unusual ways. This distortion is achieved by attaching boards and weights to the skull as it grows. Other distortions are due to the process of trepanning which as where holes were drilled into the skulls of living people. Inspection shows that these holes had healed and shows that the patients did not die when this process was applied. Museums in Peru like the Museo Regional de Ica display both these skulls and the textiles that were found around them. Provenance The necropolis on the Paracas Peninsula was discovered by Julio C. Tello in the 1920s. Tello first visited the site on July 26, 1925 following a trail that had begun in 1915 when he had purchased ancient textiles in Pisco, Peru. On 25 October 1927, Tello and his team uncovered the first of hundreds of ceremonial mummified bundle burials. Tello discovered a necropolis that contained corpses that were sat in baskets. Around each of the bodies were large textiles that included large woven cotton that was decorated with woollen embroidery. A was built near Paracas at the request of President Benevides who in August 1938 authorised Tello to build a museum to house the 380 textiles that Tello and his staff had preserved. They were able to put on display over 180 textiles. The preservation of these had been funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The embroidery illustrated here are fragments from a larger piece of fabric that were removed before they were purchased by the British Museum. Today these are only shown under limited light conditions where they are held tight between a backing material and perspex. In 1928 they began to remove these for safe keeping.

It operated Red Bay Pier on the Antrim coast and about of narrow gauge railway between the pier and Cloughcor Mines in Glenariff. The railway was narrow gauge and carried iron ore from the mines to the pier, where it was loaded onto cargo ships for export to ironworks in Scotland and England. History The pier and railway were completed in 1873,Hajducki, 1974, map 5 making it the first narrow gauge railway in Ireland. The railway operated two 2-4-0T tank locomotives built by Robert Stephenson and Company and built its own shunter with a vertical boiler that had previously powered a plant to crush stone for use as ballast. Ore was carried in four-wheeled wagons built by Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company Ltd. Horses hauled the wagons onto Red Bay Pier, where the ore was manually shovelled from the wagons down wooden chutes into the ships. Cloghcorr Mines produced less ore than the promoters hoped and the area was short of skilled and willing labour for the mine. Red Bay is not a sheltered harbour so ships at the pier were vulnerable to bad weather. The iron industry became depressed in the 1870s and in 1875 the GIOH ceased operation. Waterfoot, looking east The track was left in place for a number of years. In 1880 William Traill, promoter of the Giant's Causeway, Portrush and Bush Valley Railway & Tramway Company, sought to build a railway across Glenariff to link the GIOH line with on the narrow gauge Ballymena, Cushendall and Red Bay Railway, which connected with Ireland's railway network at . Traill was unsuccessful and the GIOH line remained out of use. The final attempt to revive the iron ore operation ended in about 1884 when the GIOH's growing losses forced it to default on its ground rent to William McDonnell, 6th Earl of Antrim. The Earl served a writ on the GIOH, which was duly wound up and its assets auctioned to defray its debts. The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway bought the two 2-4-0T locomotives and the iron ore wagons. The 2-4-0Ts were numbered 5 and 6 in the L&LSR; locomotive fleet. In 1899 number 5 was scrapped and number 6 was renumbered 6A. 6A was scrapped in 1904.

Measuring by , it consists of two parts, one of which contains twelve erotic vignettes depicting various sex positions. It is currently housed by the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy. Animal section The first third depicts animals performing various human tasks. This part of the scroll-painting has been described as satirical and humorous.\\"Erotic papyrus of Turin.\\" egyptancient.net Erotic section The final two thirds of Turin Erotic Papyrus consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are \\"scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy\\" with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness, but the women are nubile, and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC). Its high artistic quality indicates that it was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered. Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The various male images have also been interpreted as a single protagonist, who has several encounters with a courtesan. Uniqueness The severely damaged Erotic Papyrus is the only known erotic scroll-painting to have survived. Modern audiences often misconceive that ancient Egyptian art is devoid of sexual themes. After Jean-François Champollion saw the papyrus in 1824 in Turin, he described it as \\"an image of monstrous obscenity that gave me a really strange impression about Egyptian wisdom and composure.\\"The quote in the original French: \\"Ici un morceau du rituel funéraire,... et là des débris de peintures d'une obscénité monstrueuse et qui me donnent une bien singulière idée de la gravité et de la sagesse égyptienne...\\" Purpose The real significance of the images is yet unknown since those fragments of text that have survived reasonably intact have so far not yielded any clear purpose for the Erotic Papyrus. The text appears to have been hastily written in the margins and would seem to express enjoyment and delight: According to French egyptologist Pascal Vernus, the papyrus is not intended to produce sexual excitement. Indeed, the apparent continuation between the animal section and the so-called \\"erotic\\" section suggests that the papyrus was intended to amuse members of the aristocracy by portraying absurd transgressions of aristocratic standards of behaviour.

Authors are permitted to archive their work (Green OA). Preprint, postprint, and the publisher's PDF version may be used. According to the society's website, journals published are fully open access, with reuse rights based on CC-BY or CC BY-NC.  Controversies  SCIRP generated controversy in 2010 when it was found that its journals duplicated papers which had already been published elsewhere, without notification of or permission from the original author and of the copyright holder. Several of these publications have subsequently been retracted. Some of the journals had listed academics on their editorial boards without their permission or even knowledge, sometimes in fields very different from their own. In 2012, one of its journals, Advances in Pure Mathematics, accepted a paper written by a parody generator; the paper was not published, but only due to its author's unwillingness to pay the publication fee. The company has also been noted for the many unsolicited bulk emails it sends to academics about its journals. In 2013, the Open Journal of Pediatrics, a SCIRP journal, published a study which concluded that the number of babies born with thyroid problems in the western United States increased by 16 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The study has been criticized for not taking into account the fact that 2010 was a year with an unusually low number of births with thyroid problems. SCIRP refused to print a letter criticizing the study, but offered to publish it as an article for a charge. The company has been included in a list of questionable open access publishers, according to Jeffrey Beall's criteria. Beall states that \\"This publisher exists for two reasons. First, it exists to exploit the author-pays Open Access model to generate revenue, and second, it serves as an easy place for foreign (chiefly Chinese) authors to publish overseas and increase their academic status.\\" He acknowledges that its fees are relatively low, describing this as \\"a strategy that increases article submissions,\\" and that \\"it has attracted some quality article submissions. Nevertheless, it is really a vanity press.\\" Further controversy was generated by a mass resignation of the editorial board of one of the company's journals, Advances in Anthropology, in 2014. According to the former editor-in-chief, Fatimah Jackson, it was motivated by failures to include the editorial board in the journal's review process, and by \\"consistent and flagrant unethical breaches by the editorial staff in China\\", for whom publishing the journal \\"was only about making money.\\" According to Beall, this was the first mass resignation from an open-access journal.  Norwegian Science Index  In the Norwegian Scientific Index the publisher and all of its journals have a rating of 0 (non-academic).

Biography Born Verley Trenton Tubbs Jr. in Dallas, Texas, on September 25, 1915, he later became known as Vincent Trenton Tubbs Jr. While a student at Morehouse College, Tubbs was one of the founders of the Delta Phi Delta journalism fraternity. In March 1938, he launched National Negro Newspaper Week with Moss Kyles Kendrix and Bernard Milton Jones while they were newspaper editors of the Maroon Tiger at Morehouse. By the time Tubbs turned 26 years old, he had risen rapidly within the world of African American newspapers. While serving as bureau chief of the Richmond edition of the Norfolk Journal and Guide, P. B. Young, the paper's publisher, heard that Tubbs was talking to the Richmond Bureau chief of the Baltimore Afro-American and fired him. Tubbs was quickly hired by the Afro-American at a substantial pay increase. While there, Tubbs was given the challenging assignment of covering lynchings. As a \\"lynch reporter,\\" Tubbs could be called at a moment's notice to go to a remote location in the South, never sure if he would be able to find local transportation, lodging or anything resembling a hospitable environment. He would usually arrive by bus one town early to remove his city clothes and try his best to blend in with the local community. It didn't always work. In the early 1940s, Tubbs was spotted by a sheriff in the border town of Texarkana, Arkansas, who ordered him into his patrol car and took him to the chief of police. After being interrogated for several minutes, Tubbs was ordered to leave the state in five minutes. During World War Two, he was one of the few black war correspondents. Tubbs covered North Africa and the South Pacific from 1943 to 1945 for the Afro-American. After the war, he became the paper's assistant managing editor. In April 1954, he married Chicago socialite Mamie Louise Hansberry, daughter of wealthy apartment house owner Carl Augustus Hansberry. This union produced a daughter, Nantille Hansberry Tubbs. His granddaughter is actress Taye Hansberry. From 1955 to 1959, he served as managing editor of Jet magazine. After leaving Jet, he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked for the publicity department at Warner Brothers Studios. After A. S. \\"Doc\\" Young, he became one of the first African American publicists in Hollywood. In 1967, he was elected as president of the Hollywood Publicists Guild. It was the first time that an African American had headed a motion picture guild. Also in the 1960s, Tubbs helped found the United Television Movie Equity Guild to help minorities in motion picture technical fields. Tubbs was elected president of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1979. He died of a heart attack in his Los Angeles home on January 15, 1989.

She graduated with a Master of Arts degree and afterward lived and worked in London. In 1980 Usher set up the composer-publishing firm Primavera with Welsh composer Enid Luff. Usher was a founding member of Women in Music in 1987, and she has worked with ensembles including Sounds Positive, the New London Wind Ensemble, the Nash Ensemble, E2K, Ivor Bolton and Inter Artes. In the 1980s, Usher collaborated in a series of cross-arts projects with the sound sculptor and painter Derek Shiel. In 1999 Usher moved to Colchester and since 2001 has concentrated on developing works within community arts projects in North Essex. Usher has worked as Composer in Residence with the Colchester Youth Chamber Orchestra.

Unlike most other scorewriters, Mus2 allows the user to work in almost any tuning system with customizable accidentals and play back the score with accurate intonation. The application has also received praise for its clean interface and usability.Gözdamla, Emre: \\"Mus2.\\" Egemen, October 2, 2010, Adana.Delaguerre, Jacques: Mus2 Microtonal Music Notation Software  History  Mus2 (from musiki, the Ottoman Turkish word for \\"music\\") was originally the name of a music application developed by M. Kemal Karaosmanoğlu for the notation of Turkish music pieces. However, this software was never publicly released as it was not deemed ready for general use. Turkish software developer Utku Uzmen independently began working on the microtonal notation application Nihavent in September 2009, and released the first beta version in May 2010.Nihavent beta announcement on the Tuning group Nihavent went through several iterations before being picked up by Data-Soft for distribution, and the application was released on September 15, 2010 under the Mus2 name.Mus2 release announcement  Features  The foremost feature of Mus2 is its ability to re-tune a staff to any tuning system using absolute frequencies, rationals and cents. Additionally, the user can import music symbols from graphics files and fonts for use as accidentals with arbitrary cent values. Turkish music theorist and composer Ozan Yarman has used this capability of Mus2 to devise a notation system, Mandalatura, for a 79-tone kanun that he also designed himself.79-tone qanun recipe Microtonal support isn't limited to symbols; when a score using an alternative tuning system is played back, Mus2 performs the piece with correct intonation using acoustic and electronic instrument sound samples.\\"Explore\\" page on the Mus2 web site The program can work with uncommon time signatures such as 7/6 and create tuplets with ratios such as 10:7. Version 2.0 of the software adds MIDI recording capabilities with a simple sequencer and is able to map the keys of a MIDI instrument to any tuning in tandem with the built-in microtonal sampler. This also opens up the software to use as a microtonal instrument. Mus2 has been noted for its simple user interface and ease of use. The notation tools in the program are presented in a tool strip which only shows the relevant options for the selected tool. When a notation symbol is placed on the score paper, its layout and position is automatically determined, usually with no need for manual adjustment by the user. Mus2 uses its own file formats for storing scores, tunings and accidentals, which can include metadata for easy indexing and cataloguing.Uzmen, Utku: Mus2 User's Guide. It is also possible to export the score to a variety of audio and graphics formats.

Pp. 234 is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey of 41,554 households in 1,503 villages and 971 urban neighborhoods across India. Two one-hour interviews in each household covered topics concerning health, education, employment, economic status, marriage, fertility, gender relations, and social capital. Children aged 8-11 completed short reading, writing, and arithmetic tests. Additional village, school, and medical facility interviews are also available. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2012 that revisited over 40,000 of the same households as the 2005 survey. This makes the IHDS unique in India as a large-scale survey where results from two time periods can be directly compared. This survey was designed by Professors Sonalde Desai and Reeve Vanneman from University of Maryland and researchers from the National Council of Applied Economic Research and funded by the National Institute of Health. Results from this survey are summarized in a book titled Human Development in India: Challenges for a Society in Transition, published in 2010 by the Oxford University Press. A new wave of this survey is planned for 2020-22. The principal investigators for this wave are Sonalde Desai, Feinian Chen, Keera Allendorf, Amaresh Dubey and Santanu Pramanik.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. It is currently an apartment building called The Davenport. History Stockholders incorporated the Davenport Hotel Company in 1905 to construct a modern hotel that was roughly equidistance from the city's two passenger depots. The construction of the Davenport Hotel in 1907 ushered in the third phase of hotel construction in the city of Davenport. It replaced the Kimball House as Davenport's finest hotel. The other hotels that belong to this era are the Dempsey Hotel (1913), the Hotel Blackhawk (1915) and the Hotel Mississippi (1931). It was considered the first \\"modern\\" hotel in the city, and was touted as one of the finest hotels in the Mississippi River Valley when it opened. The hotel featured such amenities as \\"fireproof\\" construction, elevators, a dining room, and sample rooms for traveling salesmen. The building's interior also featured \\"steam heat, hot and cold water, telephones and electric lights, heavy brass bedsteads with box springs and hair mattresses, velvet carpets and fancy window draperies, quartered oak and Flemish oak furniture, mahogany combination tables and writing desks and beveled mirrors.\\" It was also the first of Davenport's \\"tall buildings.\\" The Davenport was built a block away from the new Rock Island Railroad station making it convenient for travelers. However, it was undermined by the Dempsey Hotel, which was built next to the station and provided moderately priced rooms. The more elegant Hotel Blackhawk also resulted in a loss of business to the Davenport and the hotel was sold to the Blackhawk Hotel company in 1916. with The hotel was damaged in a large fire in 1939. The building remained a hotel into the 1960s, but it eventually became an apartment building. It was extensively renovated in the mid-1980s at a cost of $5.5 million. Architecture The Davenport Hotel was designed by a local architecture firm, Temple and Burrows with P.T. Burrows as the architect in charge. They were also responsible for the Hotel Blackhawk, the Union Savings Bank and Trust (1924), and the Federal Court House (1932–1933). The building is six stories in height and was constructed in brick over a steel structure. It most likely has a concrete and brick foundation. The building's character is defined by its form as its decorative elements are more reserved. The six-story \\"towers\\" surround a two-story entrance in the center, which creates a sense of mass and enclosure. The building's exterior decorative elements were confined to a cornice, which is now gone, and the main entrance. It's possible the cornice was lost in the 1939 fire. The first floor of the building contains retail space and apartments on the upper floors.

Tabler Sr. (October 28, 1914 – February 3, 2004) was an American architect who designed more than 400 hotels. He was best known for giving Hilton hotels the clean but sometimes stark face of corporate America, most notably in the 46-story slablike New York Hilton Midtown near Rockefeller Center. Biography Tabler was born in Momence, Illinois, and received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard. In 1939 he joined the Chicago firm Holabird & Root, where he worked on his first big hotel project, the 1,000-room Statler Hotel in Washington, D.C. After serving in the United States Navy during the World War II, he became head of Statler's in-house architecture department in 1946. He formed his own practice, William B Tabler Architects, in 1955. Tabler's designs affected generations of travelers after World War II when downtown hotels began to look more and more like the office buildings around them. Tabler designed the 2,153-room Hilton New York near Rockefeller Center in 1963 with David P. Dann for a partnership called Rock- Hil-Uris for its principals: Laurance S. Rockefeller, Conrad Hilton, and Percy Uris and Harold Uris. Tabler died at his home in Upper Brookville, New York at the age of 89. His son, William B. Tabler Jr., is also an architect and continues the architectural practice in Manhattan.

It forms part of the civil parish of Lythe. It is the birthplace of fishing magnate George Pyman. Originally two villages, Sandsend and East Row, the united Sandsend has a pub and restaurant. A large part of the western side of the village, in The Valley, is still owned by Mulgrave Estate. The Valley is one of the most expensive areas to buy property on the Yorkshire Coast.  History  Sandsend and the neighbouring village of East Row began as separate villages, but were joined when extra cottages were built for workers in the alum industry. Sandsend was also buoyed by tourism from the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway, which ran through the village from 1855 to 1958. The local station was Sandsend railway station, which opened in 1883 and was closed in 1958.  In popular culture  In the 1947 British comedy drama Holiday Camp, the opening shots of a train arriving at a cliff-top station and passengers boarding buses outside the station were filmed at Sandsend.  Geography  Two becks empty into the North Sea at Sandsend; Sandsend Beck and East Row Beck. Both of these becks flow through Mulgrave Woods and were bridged by the railway on high viaducts across the village.  Transport  The principal public transport serving Sandsend is the Arriva North East 4 & X4 bus service, which runs from Whitby up the coast to Middlesbrough. The main road through the town is the A174 which runs from Whitby to Thornaby-On-Tees. Sandsend is located on the coastal part of the Cleveland Way and it follows the course of the old railway line northwards.

In 2001, during his first year of teaching, he established the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy (DPEA) on the Dos Pueblos High School campus. In addition to being the Director of the DPEA, he teaches physics, engineering, robotics, machining and manufacturing. His focused outreach efforts have yielded 50% female student enrollment in the DPEA. He also ran FRC Team 1717 as part of the academy program. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2010. He is the first high school teacher to win the award, as well as the first FIRST mentor to win the award for work relating to FIRST robotics.  Early life and education  Shaeer was born in São Paulo, Brazil, where his father was teaching physics at the university. Before his first birthday, his family returned to Santa Barbara, California, where he has resided ever since. He graduated from Dos Pueblos High School and attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he earned a B.S. in physics, a M.S. in mechanical engineering, and a M.Ed. in secondary education.  Career  Shaeer began his career as a mechanical engineer in the private sector. He worked on research and development in academia, aerospace, and telecommunications before deciding to pursue a career in education. Early on, he taught physics, wrote curriculum, and developed courses for the DPEA. He eventually decided that the capstone course for the senior class would revolve around the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which requires students to design and construct a robot to compete against other robots in a game challenge that is different every year. The DPEA is known as Team 1717 in the FIRST community. In 2007, he garnered a $3 million California state matching grant to create a engineering facility on the high school campus to support the implementation of the Career Technical Education (CTE) curriculum he created. The building opened in October 2011 and is currently in use. On September 29, 2010, Congresswoman Lois Capps congratulated him on the floor of the United States House of Representatives for winning the MacArthur Fellowship.  Personal life  Shaeer and his wife, Emily, have a daughter, Aliya Shaeer.  Media  The New York Times-bestselling author Neal Bascomb wrote a book chronicling Abo-Shaeer’s teaching and his 2009 FIRST robotics team’s competition season.

Retrieved on October 22, 2010. Cathy Fontenot, the Assistant Warden, said that originally prisoners and staff backed pickup trucks into a field \\"and would go out there and play around on horses.\\" Both horses and cattle are bred and raised at the prison. The horses are used by trustees to supervise field work, and the cattle are raised for sale as beef. In 1967 LSP opened the Rodeo to outside spectators. Over the years, LSP erected bleachers and adopted the rules of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. In addition the administration added an Arts and Crafts festival, and added stock animals and rodeo clowns. The current 10,000-person stadium opened in 2000. Inmate Jack Favor, a former rodeo star from Texas, worked to establish the rodeo. He was wrongly convicted of two murders in Bossier Parish and sentenced to life at Angola. He sought to instill self-discipline in the prisoners and formed a chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Prison authorities permitted Favor to travel across the state to promote the event. Favor earmarked funds raised through the rodeo to finance emergency trips for inmates, under guard. The rodeo is still operating and is the oldest prison rodeo in the United States; the Texas Prison Rodeo started in 1931 but was closed in 1986. Events # Grand Entry - Angola Rough Riders enter the arena at full gallop and colors are presented. # Bust Out - All six chutes open simultaneously, releasing six angry bulls, with temporarily attached inmate cowboys. The last man to remain on the bull wins the event. # Bareback Riding - Riders are expected to keep one hand in the air, and must stay on the horse for eight seconds to qualify. # Wild Horse Race - Six untrained horses are simultaneously released into the arena with short ropes dragging behind them. Three-man teams attempt to grab the ropes and hold the horse long enough for a team member to mount. The first team to cross the finish line while still on top of the horse is the winner. # Barrel Racing - This is the only event in which inmates do not participate. It is a tour stop for The Girls' Rodeo Association. Contestants race their horse in a pattern among three barrels. The fastest time wins. # Bull-Dogging - The animal is placed in a chute, with two cowboys positioned just outside the chute. Their job is to wrestle the animal to the ground as quickly as possible. # Buddy Pick-Up - This event requires one man on a horse (riding bareback) to navigate the length of the arena, pick up another inmate who is standing on a barrel, and race back to the finish line. # Wild Cow Milking - Teams of inmate cowboys chase the animals around the arena trying to extract a little milk. The first team to bring milk to the judge wins the prize. # Bull Riding - This dangerous event is what the fans come to see. Inmates try to stay on top of a 2,000-pound Brahma bull. To be eligible for the coveted \\"All- Around Cowboy\\" title, a contestant must successfully complete the ride (6 seconds). The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association rules govern this event. # Convict Poker - Four inmate cowboys sit at a table in the middle of the arena playing a game of poker. A bull is released with the sole purpose of unseating the poker players. The last man remaining seated is the winner. # Guts & Glory - A chit (poker chip) is tied to a Brahma bull. The object here is to get close enough to the bull to snatch the chip.Schedule of Events, Angola Rodeo, retrieved May 29, 2012 Additional points of interest * The Angola Prison Rodeo also includes an Arts and Crafts show, complete with concessions; all are produced by inmates. * Writer/Director Jeff Smith entered the 2008 Jackson Hole Film Festival with his film Six Seconds of Freedom about the rodeo.\\"Steven Phelps (April 2010), Angola Prison Blues, Cowboys & Indians, April 2010; retrieved May 29, 2012 * Simeon Soffer directed the documentary Wildest Show in the South: the Angola Prison Rodeo, which won the 2000 International Documentary Association's Distinguished Achievement Award and was nominated for an Academy Award.The Wildest Show in the South, Seventh Art Releasing, retrieved May 29, 2012 * The $450,000-a-day revenue brought in by the rodeo \\"pays for Baptist seminary classes at the prison, funerals for inmates, educational programs and maintenance of the prison's six chapels.\\"Rick Jervis (October 30, 2009), \\"Prison rodeos provide escape from routine\\", USA Today, retrieved May 29, 2012 * In 2010 the Angola Prison Horse Sale was held along with the rodeo.

It is administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of Bangladesh. It is the world's largest single paramilitary force. Etymology The name originates from the Arabic word of \\"Ansar\\", which denotes a \\"volunteer\\" and specifically refers to the companions of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, during his exile from Mecca. The Ansar force was formed as the \\"East Pakistan Ansars\\" by the East Pakistan Ansars Act of 1948, and officially launched on 12 February 1948. The first director of the Ansar was James Buchanan, a British official appointed by the government of then-Chief Minister of East Bengal Khawaja Nazimuddin in 1946. The force was placed under the administration of the home ministry of the province of East Bengal British India). The emphasis was on recruiting in border areas, where Ansars were deployed to interdict smuggling and prevent emigrants from taking valuables out of the country illegally. The force grew quickly. By early 1949 there were 118,000 Ansars. According to a story, without evidence, by a Mr Willem van Schendel, the Ansars \\"soon earned a reputation for intimidation and hooliganism, especially with regard to the non-Muslim inhabitants of East Pakistan.\\" During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Ansar were deployed to the border areas along with the East Pakistan Rifles to support the Pakistani army. = Bangladesh War of Independence = During the Bangladesh War of Independence of 1971, bulk of the Ansar joined the Bangladesh Forces guerrillas to fight against the Punjabi-run Pakistani army. 12 Ansar members presented a guard of honour to the Bangladesh government in exile at 8 Theatre road on 17 April 1971. As a result, the Ansars were disbanded by the Pakistani government. = Post- independence = After the independence of Bangladesh, the force was reconstituted as the Bangladesh Ansar. The Ansar were given fresh importance by the government of President Ziaur Rahman, which designated the Ansar as the \\"people's defence force\\" and formed Ansar battalions. Raising of Ansar battalions In 1976, 20 Battalions of Ansar were raised in line with the Armed Police Battalions to augment the strength of the security forces. At present, there are 38 Male and 2 Female Ansar Battalions deployed all over the country. Battalion Ansars are mainly deployed in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) for Counter Insurgency Operations (CIO) and south-western region of the country for Counter Terrorism Operations.  1994 mutiny and reforms  In 1994, a mutiny against low pay and unfair treatment was suppressed by the Bangladesh Rifles. This prompted a series of reforms by successive governments including the Ansar Bahini Act (1995), Battalion Ansar Act (1995) and the Village Defence Party Act (1995). Under these Acts, the Ansar Bahini and the Battalion Ansars were declared a \\"Disciplined Force\\" in accordance with article 152 of the Constitution. The government also set up \\"Ansar VDP Unnayan Bank\\" where the members of Ansar-VDP members were entitled to loans and shares. In 1998, Bangladesh Ansar and VDP were awarded the National Standard, and in 2004 it was awarded the Independence Award. The service of battalion Ansars was under National Pay Scale in October 2008, and they were entitled to family rations and combat uniform. In 2006, the role of Ansar- VDP was expanded to fight rising militancy. In 2016, the Ansar Striking Force, a 300 strong elite unit, was created to provide security to diplomats. Role The stated missions of Ansar are: *To assist Government or Any Authority under Government in matters of Public Security ; *To take part in any public welfare activities as per the Government's instructions to improve socio-economic conditions of the country. *To assist Law Enforcement agencies in metropolitan and industrial security. *To assist Bangladesh Armed Forces in national defense during war; *To provide security to national VIPs, CIPs and diplomats as per the Government's instructions. *To take part in any disaster management activities as per the Government's instructions. The members of Ansar also participate in education expansion programs, tree plantation, population control, women's empowerment, and sanitation activities. Organization There are 3 Types of Ansars: Regular Ansars (Battalion Ansars), Embodied Ansars (Armed and Attached to Industrial units, Key Point Installations etc.), and Un-embodied Ansars (Trained but Unarmed Volunteers). The total strength of the Regular Ansar is 16,000, Embodied Ansars 50,000; Un-embodied Ansars strength is close to 200,000. The Ansar is headed by a director-general, who also heads the Village Defence Party (VDPs). = Headquarters = The headquarters of the Ansar is located in Khilgaon, Dhaka and the training facilities are located at the Bangladesh Ansar & VDP Academy in Shafipur, Gazipur, north of the national capital, Dhaka. = Equipment = *Type 56 *Type 56 carbine *Lee–Enfield References Organizations established in 1948 Law enforcement in Bangladesh Gendarmerie Non-military counter- terrorist organizations Non-military counter-insurgency organizations Paramilitary forces of Bangladesh ","title":"Bangladesh Ansar"},{"id":"28971128","text":"Tôn Thất Hải (16 July 1935) is a Vietnamese fencer.

It was Gersdorff who negotiated the Treaty of Roskilde on Denmark's part during the Second Northern War, a war he had himself been in favour of entering. The treaty, which was concluded in Roskilde on 8 March 1658 (NS), ceded Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bornholm to Sweden. Early life Joachim Gersdorff was born at Søbygaard on the island of Funen to German-born Christoffer von Gersdorff, an immensely rich magnate who, over the course of his lifetime, also accumulated numerous other estates such as Palstrup, Isgård, Vosnæsgård and Udstrup. Not much is known about Joachim Gersdorffs's early life, only that he attended Herlufsholm Bording School from 1624 to 1629. His father died in 1635 and Joachim Gersdorff was accepted into the Danish nobility, choosing Søbygaard as his residence. In the late 1630s, he made a study trip to northern Germany, returning in 1640. In 1643, he married the young Øllegaard Henriksdatter Huitfeldt. In so doing, he added a number of estates in Skåneland to his holdings. Political career From 1646, he was promoted through the ranks at the Royal Court, culminating with his acceptance into the Danish Council of the Realm in late 1649. He was a popular and respected figure among the nobility and was held in high regard by the King, Frederick III, who had ascended the throne in 1648. In 1651 he was appointed Danish Steward of the Realm, at the same time receiving the island of Bornholm as a fief. Gersdorff's marriage to Øllegaard Huitfeld was an unhappy one. She fell in love with Kai Lykke, a young military officer and womanizer from Gisselfeldt, and called for divorce in 1654. This was a hard blow to his esteem and several times he had to swallow the indignity of being refused lodging when calling on castles and manor houses around the country. In 1655, he led the process against Corfitz Ulfeldt, his predecessor as Steward of the Realm, who had been charged with embezzlement and treason and Ulfeldt's conviction restored Gersdorff's reputation. From 1657 to 1660, Denmark was at war with Sweden and Gersdorff negotiated the peace on Denmark's behalf, leading to the Roskilde Treaty in 1658 which ceded Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bornholm to Sweden. At the signing of the treaty, Gersdorff is reported to have exclaimed: Death In 1661, Gersdorff became seriously ill and died shortly after. Rumour had it that he had been poisoned. Øllegaard and Gersdorff's servant, Godtfred, were both indicted and convicted. She was beheaded and he was exiled.

It is preserved as an example of a large-scale merchant operation in a Newfoundland outport. The site consists of the proprietor's house, a carriage shed, a retail shop, a retail store, a fish store and a salt store. The staff house, adjacent to but not part of the historical site, is a Registered Heritage Structure. Earlier, the premises also included a larger salt store, a cooperage, a powder magazine, a telegraph office, wharves, fish flakes, a lumber yard and a shipyard. History James Ryan Ltd. was established in the Bayley's Cove section of Bonavista in 1857 where it operated a pub as well as a retail store. The main operation was relocated to its present location on Bonavista harbour in 1869 and liquor was only sold in bulk and the fishery became the main focus. The company bought and sold salt cod, supplied salt and other materials for the cod fishery, and sold general merchandise. By 1895 James Ryan Ltd exported 100,000 quintals (approximately 5,000,000 kg) of salt cod, approximately 10% of the total for Newfoundland. James Ryan Ltd. exited the fishing industry in 1952 and continued on as a general store until closing in 1978. In 1987, the Ryan Premises at Bonavista were designated as a National Historic Site. Parks Canada took over the property and it was officially opened to the public by Queen Elizabeth II on June 24, 1997 to mark the 500th anniversary of John Cabot's landfall at Bonavista.

The church, which is close to the River Biss, consists of a nave, chancel, north chapel north aisle and vestry. The gabled south porch is believed to survive from an earlier 14th century building, however the rest of the fabric is 15th century. It has small stone spire at the western end. The interior of the church was renovated in the 18th century and includes box pews, a three-decker pulpit, and two small galleries. The gallery over the north side of the chancel was used as a schoolroom and has a fireplace. The octagonal stone font is from the 15th century and the Royal Arms of George III can be seen in the chancel. The church has no electricity supply. Conservation work took place in the 1930s and 1950s, funded by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The population of Old Dilton declined as residents moved to Dilton Marsh and the church became redundant, however it remains consecrated and the fabric is maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust.

History Solidscape was founded under the name Sanders Prototype, Inc. in 1993 by Royden C. Sanders to build PC-based 3D wax printers for rapid prototyping and creating master molds used for investment casting. Sanders Prototype was originally headquartered in Wilton, New Hampshire and later moved to its current location in Merrimack, New Hampshire, USA. In early 1998, a new management team was installed, and a substantial reorganization ensued. Sanders Prototype renamed itself Solidscape, Inc. in the Fall of 2000. The first product was the Model Maker which was a DOS-based desktop printer able to create high-resolution three-dimensional wax objects created in CAD software packages. This machine was accurate to less than 1 thousandth of an inch, allowing operators to create very small, very detailed models. The wax models could then be cast without the need of a master pattern or rubber mold. Solidscape’s machines established themselves as a favorite among custom jewelers, who appreciated the ability to create custom designs for customers and deliver finished goods faster and more consistently than creating them by hand. Solidscape's first machine was the Model 6 PRO. In addition to a vacuum cleaner, it shipped with a desk-size tower containing an Intel 486DX processor on a standard motherboard, a 15-inch CRT monitor and keyboard. Also installed in the PC was a proprietary interface card which interacted with the printer. The computer ran MS-DOS. The computer was required to prepare the CAD models (converting them from STL file to a proprietary format that the printer can utilize) and operate the printer. Conversion for most files required several hours to complete and printing required several more. Depending on the model to build, the whole process from file to finished output often required 24–30 hours. Most of these units were developmental models, and very few were sold. In 1997, the 6 PRO was revised to become the Modelmaker. In 2004, Solidscape introduced the BenchTop series of 3D printers (T66BT and T612BT), a benchtop-ready solution. The BenchTop series were DOS based and did not require an external PC. The control software could run on the printer processing unit and the front-end software ModelWorks could be installed on the customer PC. Along with the BenchTop 3D printers, Solidscape launched the model-making materials InduraCast and InduraFill model-making materials. In 2006, Solidscape introduced the higher performance BenchTop printers (T66BT2 and T612BT2). In 2007, Solidscape introduced the benchMark series of printers (T76, R66) based on the Windows platform including touch screen functionality. In 2009, Solidscape introduced the preXacto series of printers (D76+, D66+) dedicated to dental applications, incorporating the proprietary SCP technology and DentaCast material. In 2010, Solidscape introduced the benchMark (T76+, R66+), incorporating the proprietary SCP technology. In 2011, Solidscape was acquired by Stratasys, Inc (SSYS) the world market leader in 3D printing and Rapid Manufacturing systems \\"Wohlers Report\\". Products Solidscape manufactures 3D printers, 3D materials and 3D software. *3D Printers receive digital input from three- dimensional data files (STL, SLC) and create solid, three-dimensional wax master patterns through an additive, layer-by-layer process with a layer thickness [mm] from .0127 to.0762 and a resolution of [dpi] 5,000 × 5,000 × 8,000 XYZ. Build envelope of [cm] 15.2W × 15.2D × 10.1H. The machine footprint is [cm] 54.9W × 49.0D × 40.9H. *3D Materials are non-toxic thermoplastic materials featuring lost wax casting properties: fast melt out, no ash or residue, no thermal expansion. *3D Software are designed to process 3D open source files (.STL,.SLC), set up the printer's resolution as well as control the motion algorithms. Technology *Vector Printing : The proprietary printing technology in which 2 jets, build and support, move in both directions (x and y) simultaneously while depositing droplets on the build plate. \\"A Vector is a curve which is defined by two endpoints and a radius of curvature. This vector is consistently recreated by linking these three data- points and drawing the line\\". Vectored jetting is guided by the same principle. A start point, endpoint and radius of curvature is defined by the control software and the jet follows this path. With rasterized jetting, each point on the curve is strictly defined, so to make a complete curve, the print-head must move to each specifically defined spot, deposit material and move on. By its very nature, it must move, then stop, then move again. By utilizing a vectored path, the print-heads need not stop each time it deposits material onto the build area which results in smoother features. *SCP (Smooth Curvature Printing) : trademark for Vector-Jetting algorithm based on motion control technology. *DoD printing (Drop on Demand) : trademark for 3D printing technology whereby 6000-12000 droplets of a wax-like material are deposited onto a build plate to create 3D models. *DWax (Dewaxing) : the proprietary technology to remove the support material from the built model.

Norwich City led the league for much of the season, having been among the pre-season favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were a force to be reckoned with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.

This lead many pundits and experts to tip the Canaries to struggle in the new Premier League. In the opening weekend of the season Norwich City faced Arsenal at Highbury. Norwich did little to dispel these early predictions, finding themselves 2-0 behind at half time courtesy of goals from Steve Bould and Kevin Campbell. However the introduction of Mark Robins as a substitute was to set the tone for the rest of season. He quickly reduced the arrears with a diving header from a David Phillips free kick. Phillips, himself draw Norwich level after David Seaman misjudged a straightforward right wing cross. Ruel Fox then gave Norwich the lead from a tight angle before Robins sealed the comeback, pouncing on a mistake by Tony Adams to loft the ball over Seaman into the net. Gaining points from losing positions was a key feature of Norwich's early season form. Another deft chip from Robins secured victory over Chelsea after falling behind to an early strike from Graham Stuart, while a Ruel Fox header salvaged a point against Everton. Norwich's first defeat of the season inevitably came at Manchester City, a ground they had not won at since 1964. However Norwich quickly bounced back to record a fine victory at Crystal Palace courtesy of a stunning scissor kick from David Phillips. At the end of the month Norwich played host to Nottingham Forest knowing that a win would put them top of the Premier League. In front of the Sky cameras, Ian Crook gave the Canaries the lead with a stunning free kick which was promptly cancelled out by an acute yet precise finish from Nigel Clough (both goals appearing at #11 and #12 on the 'Goals Goals Goals: 101 of the Very Best 1992/93 Premier League Goals' VHS). However Norwich were not to be denied and a defensive mix up allowed Lee Power to restore Norwich's lead. David Phillips sealed victory following a clever layback from Rob Newman. =September= }} Norwich continued to defy expectations in September. Mark Robins bundled home late on against Southampton to hand Norwich the points despite a fine display from Tim Flowers in the Saints goal. The Canaries then travelled to Stamford Bridge, quickly finding themselves 2 goals behind from strikes by Mick Harford and Andy Townsend. However Norwich worked their way back into the contest thanks to some calamitous goalkeeping from Dave Beasant who allowed Mark Robins' tame effort to creep past him. Beasant was again caught out of position as Robins sidefooted Norwich's equalizer. However things went from bad to worse for Beasant who then allowed David Phillips scuffed shot to somehow squirm through his hands, gifting Norwich the points. Their position at the top of table was further entrenched with victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road and a draw against Coventry City at Highfield Road. The Sky Blues were also upsetting the bookies with a fine start to the season of their own. Ian Crook's scything shot was cancelled out by a superb individual effort from Peter Ndlovu (both goals appearing at #22 and #23 on the 'Goals Goals Goals' VHS). =October= }} The start of the month saw Norwich surrender their lead at the top of the Premiership in spectacular style with a 7-1 thrashing by newly promoted Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Alan Shearer underlined his status as the most promising young striker in the country with an outstanding display. This result helped to ensure that despite an eventual third-place finish, Norwich had the dubious distinction of finishing the season with a negative goal difference (-7). Norwich bounced back from their Blackburn disaster by progressing to next of league cup with comfortable home win against Carlisle United. Chris Sutton scoring two identical headers from two identical Ian Culverhouse crosses. However, football was soon to pale into total insignificance as personal tragedy befell Norwich keeper Bryan Gunn. His daughter Francesca losing her brave battle against leukemia. Gunn remarkably played just days later in a 2-1 home success against QPR. Mark Bowen gave Norwich the lead before Chris Sutton powered home a second. Bradley Allen pounced on a poor backpass to set up a tense finish. However, Norwich and most significantly Gunn were not to be denied. Norwich arrived on Merseyside in confident mood to take on Liverpool. It was a year when the Reds would fall way below their usual high standards. Norwich opened the scoring through Ian Butterworth, but Liverpool struck back to lead 2-1. The game then turned when Mark Bowen blazed widely over from the spot. Liverpool running out comfortable 4-1 winners. Further disappointment was to follow against struggling Middlesbrough. It took a late Daryl Sutch strike to keep Norwich in touch at the top. =November= }} The start of the month saw Norwich travel to Boundary Park in front of the sky cameras. In a pulsating game, a Mark Robins hat trick put Norwich City back on top of the Premier League after twice being pegged back by Oldham, with Oldham's second equalizer coming from a wonderful chip from outside the box by Ian Marshall. Norwich further stretched their advantage with a home win against Sheffield United. This was trumped by an outstanding 3-2 success at Villa Park. Norwich opened the scoring through David Phillips with Darren Beckford doubling the lead after a mistake from Nigel Spink. Villa leveled the game at 2-2 before Daryl Sutch scored the winner with a fierce drive. =December= }} David Phillips winner was enough to sink Wimbledon at Carrow Road. This meant that Norwich had now extended their lead at the top of the Premiership to 8 points. Norwich travelled to Old Trafford in confident mood ahead of the game against Manchester United. The game was settled by a goal from Mark Hughes who capitalized on a mistake by Daryl Sutch to fire past Bryan Gunn. It was a watershed moment for the Canaries who were about to embark on a 6 match winless run which would ultimately go a long way towards costing them the title. Local rivals Ipswich chalked up an emphatic victory at Carrow Road with goals from Steve Thompson and Chris Kywomia. The year ended with disappointing goalless draws against Spurs and Leeds. =January= }} The new year failed to bring a change of fortune as Nigel Worthington's goal was enough for Sheffield Wednesday to secure all 3 points at Hillsborough (he would be manager of the Canaries seven years later). Norwich netted their first goal in almost 8 hours of football against Coventry but were eventually pegged back by a strike from Mick Quinn. Norwich regarded their first win since the start of December with a fine 4-2 success against Crystal Palace. Lee Power capping a fine individual performance with 2 goals. Norwich were further buoyed by a 1-0 success at Goodison Park through Chris Sutton. =February= }} A heavy 3-0 defeat at Southampton was to follow before the Canaries chalked up their first win over Man City in nearly 30 years. This came courtesy of 2 goals in as many minutes. Norwich went some way to wiping away the memories of their disaster at Ewood Park with 0-0 draw at Carrow Road based on a strong defensive performance. =March= }} =April= }} =May= }} Final league table Players =First-team squad= :Squad at end of season Notes References Norwich City F.C. seasons Norwich City ","title":"1992–93 Norwich City F.C. season"},{"id":"28971333","text":"Bandi Sailu (1928 – 15 July 2000) or Sayilu Saayilu was a Marxist revolutionary born in a Dalit family in Mandapelli village, Duggondi mandal, Narsampeta Thalukh in the Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh, India.

Orimolade received considerable media attention when he healed a girl, Christina Abiodun Akinsowon, from a long-term trance in which she could neither speak nor hear. After the healing event, Orimolade Tunolase and Abiodun Akinsowon teamed up, as father and adopted daughter, and offered their services to heal and pray for people. The Cherubim and Seraphim group have dreams and visions that facilitate the connection of God and humanity. In 1925, they said that Jesus Christ had directed them to name their circle of followers seraphim, after an angel they claimed to have seen in their dreams. Two years later, they added \\"Cherubim\\" to the name of their church, making their congregation the Cherubim and Seraphim.Hood, Robert. Must God remain Greek?:Afro cultures and God-talk. copyrighted material. Minneapolis, U.S.A.: Fortress press, 1990. 21-22. Print. Several years after the creation of the Cherubim and Seraphim, different denominations following in its traditions broke off and formed new churches. The Church of Aladura, which began in 1930 under the lead of Josiah Oshitelu, was one of the churches that began under \\"similarly spectacular circumstances\\" as the Cherubim and Seraphim.Glazier, Stephen.D. (2001). Encyclopedia of African and African-American religions. Rutledge, New York: Berkshire. By the 1940s, the Aladura movement church had begun to spread throughout the world, from places in Africa to other English speaking countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Life of the founder The founder, Moses Orimolade Tunolase, was born in 1879, into the quarters of the royal family of Omoba Ode Sodi of Okorun quarters, in Ikare, Nigeria.Orimolade Tunolase, Moses. Dictionary of African Christian Biography. Retrieved (2010, September 13) from http://www.dacb.org/stories/nigeria/orimolade_moses.html Records show that Orimolade's life began strangely. His mother, Madam Odijoro, said that when she was pregnant, she went to the farm to cut some firewood on a particular day. When she was ready to leave, she realized she could not lift the firewood she had cut. Suddenly, she heard a voice telling her the easiest way to lift all of the firewood. She looked around but could not find anyone. Then, the voice said, \\"Do not be frightened, I am the child in your womb. Follow my advice and be on your way.\\" She claimed to have been able to lift the firewood with the help of the unknown voice. When he was born, his parents had mixed feelings. They were excited about the new addition to their family, but were also embarrassed because of the strange circumstances that surrounded his birth. According to records, \\"The new child stood up right after his birth and walked around the delivery place.\\" The midwife that helped with his delivery held him down forcefully to stop him from walking. Members of the Cherubim and Seraphim believe that the force of the midwife, in addition to some incantations made by his herbalist father to calm him down on the day he was born, led to Orimolade's \\"prolonged paralysis\\". Because his father could no longer bear the embarrassment surrounding his son's birth, he asked Orimolade and his mother to leave his house for good, after which he planned to commit suicide, but was discouraged by family members. Family members claimed that it was not hard to tell that he had a little time left to live. Not long after Orimolade and his mother left his father's house, Orimolade sent a message to his father, telling him to go to a nearby hill (now known by the Cherubim and Seraphim in Ikare as calvary) to ask for forgiveness for his sins. People claim that the message threw Orimolade's father into complete depression, which caused him to become ill. He requested that his wife be close to him on his sickbed, and he blessed her the way an elderly Yoruba man about to die would. Days after his death, he was buried \\"honorably.\\" Books claim that one night, Orimolade was in a church singing some songs of praises. Astonished by the voices, the minister, who thought they were the voices of the choir, went over to the church to ask them why they were using the church without his permission. However, upon his arrival, he found that it was just a boy, about 5 years old, singing as though he was a group of choristers. Amazed by this, the minister decided that the church should employ Orimolade to teach them spiritual songs. After Orimolade left the church, he continued to spread the word around Nigeria, preaching in Benin, Delta, Kwara, Niger and finally Lagos, where he died in 1933. Days before his death, historians mentioned that an \\"emblem appeared in the sky, so that many stars dropped off the sky.\\"Anjorin, S.O. (2007). Moses Orimolade-the saint among the angels. Minna, Niger state: King James Publishers. Before his death, he prophesied that the Cherubim and Seraphim was going to spread worldwide, this prophecy has actually come to pass because the church is now known worldwide and has different branches under it. Spreading the Word Orimolade claimed his calling was to go about preaching the gospel of the Lord and heal the sick. However, he felt overwhelmed by the ridicule he received from the people of Ikare because of his disability. So, he decided to pray, and he asked for God to manifest himself. Records say that in reply to his prayer, an angel appeared to him in his dreams, presenting him with a rod, which they claimed signified a \\"rod of victory\\", an insignia which represented a \\"power of prayer and power of speaking\\", and a crown which stood for \\"all honor and Multi- respect of every individual to bow before him to receive blessing.\\" After Orimolade woke up, he knew his prayer had been answered. He ordered his mother to wash him, and from then on the gospel of Jesus Christ was his sole purpose. He began his campaign when he petitioned the police to release a group of Christians who had had a clash with some traditional worshippers. It was recorded that, \\"He preached with so much vehemence that the earth opened its mouth ... and they were all afraid and many of them ran away, but his brother, Egunjobi did many rituals according to ancient customs to put the earth back to its former closure ... There were proclamations about the earthquake so that people from abroad came to witness the incident and [Orimolade's] name was as fearful as that of an invisible spirit.\\" That event marked the end of hostility towards him from the people of his town. In 1916, Orimolde left his hometown of Ikare for Irun, which was about six miles away. On getting there, he found the people celebrating the festival of Osijora, the idol they worshipped. He pulled down the images of this idol, and \\"opened the seal of witchcraft, and acrobatic evil worshippers.\\" From Irun, he headed straight to Ogbagi, a nearby village, and did the same thing, after which he preached the gospel of God and showed the people what God expected from them in order to enter heaven. He continued his journey of gospel, and repeated his actions in town after town throughout Nigeria. He went to places such as Akungba, where he prayed and healed people, to Oka, where he rebuked the people for worshipping masquerades, to Kiran, with a few people from Oka carrying him on their head. He continued on to Ibilo, Merri, Ipele, and Ifon, and from Ifon they carried him to Owo. Orimolade also stopped by Benin, where they worshipped a golden statue by feeding it with human blood. He rebuked them for their actions, told them to destroy the image, told them about God, and taught them ways to worship him. Worship Practices The Cherubim and Seraphim Church base most of their worship methods and objects of worship on the New Testament of the Bible, particularly the Book of Revelation. The objects they use include candles, to represent light, backed with Revelation 3:1-3. The use of the candles also represent God as when God revealed Himself to mankind (the Israelites) on Mount Sinai as a fire, to Moses in the bush in a form of fire and many other instances when God revealed Himself and showed His power through fire.; rods, as a sign of authority, from Revelation 2:26-27; incense, which they believe drives away evil spirits and creates a holy and serene atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to take preeminence, from Malachi 1:11 and Revelations 5:8,8:4; and they ring bells not only as a sign of victory but also for musical purposes. Again, before any service is commenced, the most senior elder rings the bell three times. This is known as \\"Call To Worship). As the name suggests, it is used to call people around the Church premises to join in prayers. It is again believed that, the bell calls on the Heavenly Creatures to assist us in our prayers. They wear white garments as a form of uniform, and they believe that garments such as these should be the dress of the faithful, because they were what Christ wore during his suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection.Tovey, Philip. (2004). Inculturation of Christian worship: exploring the eucharist. Hampshire, England: Ashgate publishing Limited. The Cherubim and Seraphim have special prayers for sick people, which are used as a form of faith healing. These prayers are led by the leaders of the church, while the sick person kneels in the middle of a circle, if they are able. During such prayers, the leader reads some selected Psalms and other Bible passages that corresponds with the situation of the sick person and the prayers going to be offered and summarizes the prayer. Each prayer is recited once or thrice, and at times recited up to seven times, depending on the seriousness of the illness. In some instances, the sick people are made to sleep in the temple for the number of days within which prayers and supplications will be made for them. The Cherubim and Seraphim believe in the use of water and oil. They believe that water has a type of healing power, because of the strength of baptism and the spirit of God that dwells within it. They also believe in the use of consecrated oil, because it is backed by the bible in James 5:14-15. Fasting is another tradition they have. They believe it is \\"an injunction of Christ for support of prayers.\\" The Cherubim and Seraphim also believe that fasting increases their spiritual strength and speeds up their success in spiritual matters. The church also has a set of taboos. They have food taboos, which place a restraint on what they can and cannot eat. Taboos include sexual immorality, drunkenness, and all works of the flesh as stated in Galatians 5:19-21, using charms, and making use of things of a magical nature. The Cherubim and Seraphim also have special ceremonies/anniversaries, such as Holy Michael's Anniversary, which takes place on September 29 of every year. This event is used to thank God for all the victories He grants them as Holy Michael fights the battles of the faithful. It again used to acknowledge the presence of Holy Michael and his work among the Christian folks. On this day, they have a church service in which they read two lessons from the bible, from Daniel 12 and Revelations 12. Holy Gabriel's Anniversary is another special ceremony, observed on the third Thursday in August. The Anniversary of Cherubim Band is celebrated on the last Thursday in May, and the Cherubim and Seraphim wear special dresses for this sermon. They also celebrate the Anniversary of Seraphim Band, which takes place on September 9 every year to commemorate the day the society was named in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1925.This event is also held throughout all the branches of the Church, throughout the world. On the first Friday in November, they fast throughout the day to observe the Repentant Meeting Day. They also celebrate a Day of Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem, which takes place on the first Sunday in July. It is a day set aside for prayers for peace. It is believed that Jerusalem is the seat of Christendom hence, by praying for the peace of Jerusalem, it is a prayer for peace for all Christendom and in the world at large. Lastly, they celebrate Love Feast, during which the church provides a meal of water and bread for the congregation, and read a few bible passages while they eat the food. The Cherubim and Seraphim have church services throughout the week. They have special services on Sunday. On Mondays, they meet for prayers for Visioneers, Dreamers and all spiritual workers for spiritual power. On Tuesdays, they have Bible Class at 6 pm. On Wednesdays, the women meet to pray from 9am to 3pm and later in the night, the men meet to pray from 12am. On Thursdays, they have what they call \\"Mid-week Full Service\\" at 6pm. At 6 pm on Fridays, they have \\"Protection Mark/Sealing Service. Finally, on Saturdays, a vigil is observed from midnight until 2am.

It has academy status and sponsored by Canterbury Christ Church University.  School History  Archers Court Secondary School opened in 1955 as a Secondary modern and named after the Knight of Archer's Court manor in the parish of Whitfield. The school was built as a response to growing demand for educational services from new housing estates (Beauxfields, Newlands, Cranleigh Drive, Farncombe Way) in Whitfield and surrounding villages. During the 1980s, a 6th form was introduced in addition to the existing 11–16 curriculum. In 1995, Kent Education Committee upgraded Archers Court from a 'high ability' school for pupils aged 11–16 to 'wide ability' taking pupils up to age 18. In 2002, as part of the Specialist schools programme, the school received special status as a Mathematics and Computing College with subsequent extensions to replace temporary accommodation in 2007 and 2008 and new English and Drama blocks. In 2008, with inconsistent levels of achievement at GCSEs at well below the Kent average, it was agreed to convert the school to a government-funded academy. The main driver was a ‘structural solution’ to ensure that the school achieved at least 30% 5 A*-C grades at GCSE level including English and Maths. In 2010, sponsored by Canterbury Christ Church University and co-sponsored by Dover Grammar School for Boys, Dover Grammar School for Girls and Kent County Council, the school was relaunched as Dover Christ Church Academy and received academy status. In 2014, the school underwent an £11.9 million refurbishment. The new extension included specialist and vocational teaching spaces including science laboratories, hair, beauty, textiles, and catering. The sports hall was extended with remodelled dance and fitness suites, and new changing room facilities. The project was completed in late 2015.

Paul is considered one of the foremost amputee triathletes in history and holds or has held several records in various events.  Biography  Paul Martin's left leg was amputated in 1992, when he was twenty-five years old, following a car accident. He began serious sports training almost immediately afterwards, and ran his first sprint-distance triathlon (.45 mile swim, 12.4 mile bike, 3.1 mile run) in 1995. He soon turned to the far more grueling Olympic-distance (0.93 mile swim, 24.8 mile bike, 6.2 mile run) and eventually, the Ironman-distance triathlon (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, 26 mile run).http://www.ossur.com/pages/13700 In 1997, Paul was named the USA Triathlon Olympic-Distance National Champion for the first time; he has since won it five more times (1998, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007). He also won the silver medal in the lower extremity athlete division at the International Triathlon Union World Championships. For his accomplishments, Paul was named the US Olympic Committee's Disabled Athlete of the Year. In 1998, Paul's comeback from his devastating injury continued as he participated in the ITU World Championships again, this time taking the gold medal. He also won bronze in the road race at the IPC Disabled Cycling World Championships and finished fourth in the time trials. In addition, Paul was named to the US Disabled Alpine Ski Team.http://www.wickedlocal.com/natick/news/x393523873/Paul-Martins-triathlon- accomplishments-continue Paul set a standard in 1999 when he became the first amputee to ever complete \\"The Double\\"—the famous Ironman World Championship in Hawaii followed by the XTERRA World Championship off-road triathlon a week later. In 2000, Paul participated in the Paralympic Games for the first time as part of the US Cycling Team, finishing 4th in the kilo, 6th in the pursuit, and 7th in the road race. 2001 saw Paul set another milestone as he became the first lower-extremity amputee to participate in an adventure race, the Expedition BVI. Paul was also named to the US Amputee Hockey Team for the first of four straight years, and won the gold medal for the second time at the ITU World Championships. In 2002, Paul was named Disabled Cycling Time Trial World Champion and won a silver medal at the ITU World Championships. Paul continued his athletic excellence in 2004 by running the Boston Marathon in a personal best 3:24:49 and the Silver Strand Half-Marathon/Leg Amputee National Championships in 1:28:04, netting a silver medal in the process. He was named to the Paralympic Cycling Team for the second time, winning silver in the team sprint and bronze in the individual pursuit. For these achievements, Paul was named Competitor Magazine’s Endurance Awards “Challenged Athlete of the Year.\\" 2005 was a career year for Paul. He took the gold medal for the third time at the ITU World Championships and ran the Bolder Boulder 10K road race in a personal-best 39:18. However, his most impressive performance of the year was finishing the Ironman Coeur d’Alene in Idaho in 10:09:17, which is the current Ironman world record for leg amputees. He was then named the Challenged Athletes Foundation \\"Most Inspirational Athlete\\" of the year and was nominated for an ESPN ESPY award in the Best Male Athlete with a Disability category. Paul has since remained active, participating in numerous triathlon, running, and cycling events. He has finished a total of ten Ironman triathlons over his career and has written two books, \\"One Man's Leg\\" and \\"Drinking out of My Leg,\\" both of which detail his life and athletic accomplishments as an amputee. He is supplied with custom prosthetic legs for running and cycling by A Step Ahead Prosthetics in Hicksville, NY and is a member of Team A Step Ahead, a group of elite amputee athletes sponsored by A Step Ahead Prosthetics.

Now completely enclosed within downtown Savannah, Georgia, the bluff is most notable for being the site upon which General James Edward Oglethorpe arrived to settle the British colony of Georgia. The area was originally inhabited by the Yamacraw Indians. A stone marker and statue now adorn the bluff in honor of its historic significance. History Yamacraw Bluff was first inhabited around 1730 by a group of Creek Indians who named themselves after the bluff. Their chief, Tomochichi, was also the founder of the tribe. In 1733, General James Oglethorpe and 114 colonists landed on the bluff. The general went on to found the town of Savannah with the help of the chief and a local interpreter, Mary Musgrove. The Native Yamacraws eventually left the bluff to merge with a larger inland tribe, having occupied the bluff for less than two decades. Monuments and markers In anticipation of the 1933 bicentennial celebration of Georgia's founding, a stone marker was laid on Bay Street in a small park just west of Savannah City Hall. The marker, erected in 1930, reads: :This is Yamacraw Bluff where the Colony of Georgia was founded, February 12, 1733, by Gen.

The church was built in the 13th or 14th century and was decorated with brick and marble patterns. The west part of the church (the narthex) is entirely in ruins. History and architecture The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is known to the locals as \\"The Little Monastery\\" (Манастирчето, Manastircheto), possibly because it once belonged to a now-ruined medieval monastery. Located beneath the northeastern part of Nikopol's medieval fortress, the church has been conclusively dated to the 13th–14th century, that is, the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1396/1422). During this period, Nikopol evolved into a major Bulgarian fortress on the Danube and a cultural centre of its region. The church is of the crossed-dome style and its cella is almost square, as it measures . The church has a single apse and a single nave, and it used to have three domes. The elongated main octagonal dome has been preserved, though the two other domes, which were positioned over the narthex, have not, as the entire narthex has been destroyed. The walls of the church were constructed out of rectangular stone blocks interchanged with two rows of red brickwork. More elaborate stone and brick patterns decorate the facade and the main dome. Each of the dome's eight sides features arches, with either a narrow window or a blind arch nested in. Marble was employed in the facade's decoration. The overall architectural style has been likened to that of Veliko Tarnovo and Nesebar's medieval churches. The Church of Saints Peter and Paul could possibly be the one referenced in 15th-century writer Vladislav the Grammarian's account of the transportation of Saint John of Rila's relics from Tarnovo back to the Rila Monastery in 1469. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova believes that the connection is far from certain, as the church from Vladislav's writings is only known as \\"the church of zhupan Bogdan\\" and was located within the Nikopol Fortress. The church is included among Bulgaria's monuments of culture of national importance. It was added to the list in 1927, with a publication in that year's State Gazette issue 69.

She was tortured by him over a period of four weeks, including having her eyes gouged from their sockets up to three weeks before her death, before being drowned in a bathtub. The murder inquiry was headed by Detective Sergeant Joseph Monaghan of Greater Manchester Police, who said: \\"I have been in the police force for 15 years and have never seen a case as horrific as this.\\" William Lawler, the pathologist who examined Bates' body, described her injuries as the worst he had seen on a murder victim. Smith, with a history of violence and torture against former sexual partners, denied murdering Bates but was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on 19 November 1997. Background James Smith was an unemployed divorcee living in the Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as \\"house-proud\\" and \\"well groomed\\", he was a teetotaller and non-smoker. His marriage had ended in 1980, after ten years, because he had been violent towards his wife. His next relationship was with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom between 1980 and 1982 he \\"used as a punch-bag\\", even subjecting her to severe beatings while she was pregnant with his child. She said: \\"At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But in the end it was every day. He would smack me in the face or hit me over the head with an ashtray. He would kick me in the legs or between the legs.\\" Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. When that relationship came to an end in 1982, Smith then started seeing 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, whom he also abused. In one attack he held her head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her. In 1993, Smith began grooming Kelly Bates when she was only 14 years old, having met her while she was babysitting for friends. Approximately two years later, when she had left school, Bates moved in with Smith at his home in Furnival Road, Gorton. She was concealing the age difference between them from her parents, Tommy and Margaret Bates. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two had started living together: \\"As soon as I saw Smith the hairs on the back of my neck went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him.\\" Although she had left Smith briefly because of arguments with him, she was once more living with him at Furnival Road by the end of November 1995. Her parents noticed bruises on her, which she explained away as being the results of accidents. She became increasingly withdrawn and in December 1995 resigned from her part-time job. In March 1996, her parents received cards purportedly from her for their anniversary and a birthday, but only Smith had written in them. When Bates' brother tried to see her at the house, Smith said she was not at home. When a concerned neighbour asked after her, she was briefly shown at an upstairs window. Murder On 16 April 1996, Smith reported to authorities that he had accidentally killed his girlfriend during an argument in a bathtub, claiming that she had inhaled water and died following his attempts at resuscitation. He also claimed that she often pretended to be unconscious. Police went to Smith's address and found Bates' naked body in a bedroom. Her blood was found throughout the house, and a post- mortem examination revealed over 150 separate injuries on her body. During the last month of her life she had been kept bound, sometimes tied by her hair to a radiator or furniture, or by her neck by way of a ligature. William Lawler, the Home Office pathologist who examined her body, said: \\"In my career, I have examined almost 600 victims of homicide but I have never come across injuries so extensive.\\" The following injuries were found on Bates' body: *Scalding to her buttocks and left leg *Burns on her thigh caused by the application of a hot iron *A fractured arm *Multiple stab wounds caused by knives, forks and scissors *Stab wounds inside her mouth *Crush injuries to both hands *Mutilation of her ears, nose, eyebrows, mouth, lips and genitalia *Wounds caused by a spade and pruning shears *Both eyes gouged out *Later stab wounds to the empty eye sockets *Partial scalping The pathologist determined that her eyes had been removed \\"not less than five days and not more than three weeks before her death\\". She had been starved, having lost around 20 kg in weight, and had not received water for several days before her death. Peter Openshaw, the prosecutor in Smith's trial, said: \\"It was as if he deliberately disfigured her, causing her the utmost pain, distress and degradation ... The injuries were not the result of one sudden eruption of violence; they must have been caused over a long period [and] were so extensive and so terrible that the defendant must have deliberately and systematically tortured the girl.\\" The cause of death was drowning, immediately prior to which she had been beaten about the head with a showerhead. Openshaw said that \\"Her death must have been a merciful end to her torment\\". Trial Smith denied murder and claimed Bates \\"would put me through hell winding me up\\". He also claimed that Bates had \\"taunted\\" him about his dead mother and had \\"a bad habit of hurting herself to make it look worse on me\\". When asked to explain why he had blinded, stabbed and battered Bates, he said she had dared him to do it, challenging him to do her harm. Gillian Mezey, a consultant psychiatrist, told the court that Smith had \\"a severe paranoid disorder with morbid jealousy\\" and lived in a \\"distorted reality\\". The jury at Manchester Crown Court took one hour to find 49-year-old Smith guilty of Bates' murder. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge, Mr. Justice Sachs, recommended that Smith serve a minimum term of 20 years. He stated: \\"This has been a terrible case; a catalogue of depravity by one human being upon another. You are a highly dangerous person. You are an abuser of women and I intend, so far as it is in my power, that you will abuse no more.\\" The jury were provided with professional counselling to help them deal with the distress of seeing the photographs of Bates' injuries and the \\"sickening violence\\" of the case. In the media =Television= The murder has been the subject of at least one television documentary: *Britain's Darkest Taboos, series 4, episode 2: \\"Our Daughter Was Tortured To Death By Her Sadistic Boyfriend\\".

It is the location of two mansions built by two lumber barons until it became the campus of an Episcopal girls' school named St. Katharine's Hall and later as St. Katharine's School. The name was altered to St. Katharine-St. Mark's School when it became coeducational. It is currently the location of a senior living facility called St. Katherine's Living Center. Description The historic district is a campus of . At the time of its nomination to the National Register, it was made up of six buildings. with Two of the buildings were built as houses, Cambria Place and the Renwick Mansion. The other buildings include a large combination classroom and dormitory building, a chapel, and a combination classroom and gymnasium building. The sixth building was a modern dormitory that was not a contributing property and has subsequently been torn down. The district is located in the southeast corner of the LeClaire Reserve. The landscaped grounds are on the side of a hill overlooking a mixed residential and light industrial area along the Mississippi River to the south. To the east is the Bridge Avenue Historic District, a residential neighborhood dating from the 1870s to the 1910s. The LeClaire Reserve, which is largely made up of residential neighborhoods, is located to the north and west. History School Seal In 1883 the Rt. Rev. William Stevens Perry, the second Bishop of Iowa announced his intention to build a school for girls in Davenport. The diocese already operated Griswold College in Davenport. It was founded on the property of the former Iowa College, now known as Grinnell College after it moved to Grinnell, Iowa. The school had been founded in 1859 by the Rt. Rev. Henry Washington Lee, the first Bishop of Iowa. A high school for boys, called Kemper Hall, was created later on the campus in 1885. The school was officially closed in 1899. The college property today is the location of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and Davenport Central High School. St. Katharine's Hall replaced Trinity School for girls, which was located in the parish hall of the cathedral. The diocese was able to consider opening a new school for girls based on the will of Sarah Burr from New York City. She had bequeathed $30,000 for such a purpose.Horton, 53. They chose a residence on the east side of Davenport called \\"Cambria Place,\\" the former home of John L. Davies, for the location of the school that opened in 1884. Adelia Rice was the school's first principal. Its initial enrollment was 25 students. The institution was considered a \\"superior\\" church boarding school with a college preparatory curriculum. It also allowed day students from the area to enroll. The school grew quickly and an addition, called St. Mary's Hall, was built in 1885 and 1886. By its third year, there was room for 60 boarding students. While most of the students were Episcopalian, there was no such requirement for admission to the school. Class stones The school continued to grow. In 1888 the Richardson Observatory was built. It was said to contain the finest telescope in Iowa.Horton, 54 In 1902 the administration of the school was taken over by the Sisters of St. Mary. St. Mary's Chapel and a gymnasium were built in 1903 and the neighboring Renwick House was added to the campus in 1909. It was renamed St. Margaret's Hall. A former teacher at St. Katharine's, Marion Crandall, was the first American woman killed in World War I. She had taught French at the school and went to work for the French Canteen. Crandall was killed by an exploding shell in France on March 27, 1918.Horton, 76-77 A picture from St. Katharine's in the early 20th century Major changes came to St. Katharine's in the second half of the 20th century. The school became co-educational in 1966 and discontinued accepting boarding students in 1968. With the addition of boys, the name of the school was changed to St. Katharine-St. Mark. In 1973 it moved to the Joseph F. Bettendorf House in neighboring Bettendorf, Iowa. The school amicably broke its ties with the Episcopal Church in 1980. In 2000 the name of the school changed to Rivermont Collegiate. When the school moved to Bettendorf, the St. Katharine's property was sold and became a nursing home complex. The buildings started to fall into disrepair until they were bought in 1997 by historic property developer Chris Ales, who converted the complex into a senior living center in 2001. The facility was transformed into 38 low- income senior citizen apartments. The Renwick House was renovated by Ales for his company's headquarters, but he was forced to sell the property to Dr. Joseph Seng in 2007. It was turned into a bed and breakfast. Mass Mound There is a legend in the city of Davenport that it will be spared from destruction by a tornado because of the Mass Mound. In 1835 after a period of intense storms a Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Charles Van Quickenborne, SJ, led the first Christian service in what would become the city of Davenport. He erected a crucifix made from native black walnut on a crude altar placed on top of what he called a Mass Mound. It was located on the side of the hill on the St. Katharine's property. He gathered both the white settlers and the Native Americans in the region regardless of their faith and celebrated Mass for a week. On the last day, he held Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and blessed the area to preserve it from storms and tornadoes. The early settlers in Davenport considered the spot a sacred place. Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourges, the first pastor of St. Anthony's Church in Davenport regularly meditated at the site and was known to spend the night in prayer there before the cross before major decisions or when problems arose. Eventually, the crucifix fell apart and was taken away. In time lumber baron John L. Davies built his home on the property before the Diocese of Iowa bought the property for St. Katharine's. A fire erupted at several lumber mills on July 24, 1901 in the Village of East Davenport. It destroyed of land, 250 people were left homeless, and businesses suffered $1.25 million in losses. When the fire got to St. Katharine's the wind shifted towards the river. The Mass Mound was credited for sparing the rest of the city. A shrine was erected in 1928 at the Mass Mound site to the southwest of where the main building is located. It was blessed by the Rt. Rev. Theodore N. Morrison, the third Bishop of Iowa. An altar dedicated to St. Joseph was blessed by Dean Philbrook of Trinity Cathedral on April 29, 1931. The altar was moved to Bettendorf when St. Katharine-St. Mark's School relocated to the Bettendorf Mansion. Architecture Both Cambria Place and the Renwick Mansion were designed by John C. Cochrane, who was one of Davenport's first professional architects. His most famous work was the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines. Both houses were built in the Italian Villa style, which Cochrane introduced to Davenport. The additions were designed by Davenport architect Edward S. Hammatt, who also designed several other buildings for the Diocese of Iowa, including Kemper Hall. The additions were designed to match Cambria Place. =Cambria Place= The principal significance of this building comes from its association with lumber baron John L. Davies. Davies moved to Davenport in 1841. After ten years he entered a partnership in a planning mill with B. F. Coates. In 1859 he bought the Cannon and French Sawmill with George H. French as his partner. He continued to expand his lumber interests in Wisconsin and Iowa. Politically, Davies belonged to the Republican Party and was an ardent abolitionist. He had Cambria Place built in 1872. Cambria Place is an eclectic version of the Italian Villa and exemplifies the extravagant Late Victorian architecture found in Davenport. It is a 2½-story structure designed by Chicago architect John C. Cochrane, formerly of Davenport, that features asymmetrical massing and an entrance tower. The house was constructed of red brick, with a hipped roof covered in slate, ornamented eve brackets, decorative gabled dormers, and different window shapes.Svendsen, 10.1. The dormers and gable ends feature round arch windows while the windows on the first floor have wide, nearly flush stone lintels of irregular shapes. On the west side of the house are two full height, projecting polygonal bays. The brick porch and the bay window to the right were added in the early 20th century. =Renwick Mansion= Renwick Mansion The Renwick Mansion is significant by its association with another lumber baron, William Renwick. He also moved to Davenport in the 1840s. He began his working career in 1850 when he joined his father in the grain commission business. They entered a partnership to manufacture lumber under the name Renwick & Son in 1852. By the end of the decade, William continued the business as a sole proprietor named Renwick & Company. He entered into a partnership in 1875 with George S. Shaw and Edward S. Crosset, and they operated the lumber manufacturing firm of Renwick, Shaw & Crossett. In terms of production and workforce, it was the third-largest mill in the city. Around 1884 they sold the business to Friedrich Weyerhäuser and his partner Frederick Denkmann. The mill buildings were destroyed in the 1901 East Davenport fire. Renwick is associated with two other structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Davenport, his previous home Renwick House (1867) and the Renwick Building (1897). Renwick had this house built by T. W. McClelland in 1877. John C. Cochrane was the architect of this house as well, and H.G. Bramlich designed the landscaping. It is considered the finest example of the Italian Villa style in the city. The two-story house features a tripartite, symmetrical facade that is clad in rock-faced limestone. Projecting polygonal bays flank the main entrance and a columned porch. The entrance itself is in a large three-story entry tower with ornate iron cresting. In the frieze of the cornice are small rectangular windows in groups of three at the front. It is capped with a hipped roof and ornate iron cresting. The interior features to high wood parlor doors, eight fireplaces, and a three-story staircase. =Classroom/Dormitory= Classroom/Dormitory building (left) and Classroom/Gymnasium (right) St. Mary's Chapel The Classroom/Dormitory building, also known as St. Mary's Hall, was built as an addition to Cambria Place from 1884 to 1885. It is a two-story, rectangular plan structure built on a high basement. Designed in a late Victorian Eclectic style, it is capped with a high hipped mansard roof. It features large gabled wall dormers and small wood roof dormers. Round arch windows are found in the roof dormers below a pediment. Both the wall and the roof dormers have gable roofs that are flared at the eaves. The cornice is broad and it is decorated with large fan- shaped wooden brackets. =Classroom/Gymnasium= The Classroom/Gymnasium addition was added onto St. Mary's Hall from 1902 to 1903. It is a three-story brick structure that follows a largely rectangular plan and it is capped by a hipped roof. The lower half of the wall buttresses are faced with concrete. This addition is much plainer than the rest of the facility and it suggests the move from the picturesque forms of the late 19th century to a more utilitarian form. The triangular-headed windows suggest the Gothic Revival style. Large brick wall buttresses divide the length of the building into five bays. The gymnasium was located on the third floor and is indicated on the exterior by the tall windows. A two-story addition was built later onto the north side. =St. Mary's Chapel= St. Mary's Chapel was added at the same time as the Classroom/Gymnasium addition. It too was designed in the late Gothic Revival style. Constructed in brick, the chapel features a square bell tower on the south side that is crenelated at the top. The bargeboards are flared at the gable ends. The chapel is five bays in length and divided by buttresses. The nave is indicated by lancet windows. It is connected to St. Mary's Hall by a hyphen.

It was established to provide a reliable and affordable source of irrigation water for 72,000 acres of agricultural area surrounding Escalon, Ripon, and Manteca, California. In 2005, as unprecedented urban growth replaced agricultural land, the district expanded into providing domestic water service to South San Joaquin County cities with its state-of-the-art membrane filtration water treatment plant. SSJID’s historic water rights allow for several hydroelectric power plants on a series of dams and reservoirs on the Stanislaus River. SSJID and Oakdale Irrigation District completed the original Melones Reservoir in 1926, and since 1957 have co-owned the Tri-Dam Project, consisting of Donnells Dam, Beardsley Dam, and Tulloch Dam reservoirs and powerhouses. The World’s First Single-Axis Solar Tracking System SSJID recently (dedicated July 18, 2008) completed a 1.4 megawatt solar farm that provides nearly all of the electricity to run its water treatment plant, saving the district over $400,000 annually in power costs. SSJID’s solar farm is recognized as the world’s first single-axis solar tracking system featuring thin-film photovoltaic cells. The tracking system was developed by Conergy, the premier leader in the solar technology field. The District recognized that through this technology, it could not only reduce the electricity costs of its customers, but it could stabilize costs which usually fluctuate seasonally. “The project’s main goal was to stabilize electrical costs, which can spike substantially in summer months given local time of use (TOU) metering,” said SSJID Utility Systems Director Don Battles. In addition to the project's $400,000 annual electric bill savings, the solar energy systems provide the District with a hedge against rising utility costs. And, he adds, both projects are hooked into the state's electrical grid, which means the District will be able to sell its surplus, peak-time energy (another precious commodity) back to the local utility. ROSI (Return On Solar Investment) is an advantage that benefits both companies and residential consumers. The system that SSJID adopted works to actually track and follow the sun, turning on its central axis for optimum exposure to the sun. “Photovoltaic” means that the sunlight is converted directly to electricity. Conversion rates vary around 15% but by using solar tracking, it is estimated to increase efficiency by 30-40%. Importance of Irrigation in Drought-Sensitive Areas In areas of the country like California's Central Valley, weather changes and recent years of severe drought make growing crops slightly unsteady. However, the Central Valley is one of the world's most productive agricultural regions. In 2002, NPR reported that the Central Valley grows a full 25% of the food that America eats. Irrigation to sustain these crops is paramount to the agricultural economy of the state and the reliance of the entire country. About one-sixth of the irrigated land in the United States is in the Central Valley. The Central Valley is the primary source for a number of food products throughout the United States, including tomatoes, almonds, grapes, cotton, apricots, and asparagus. The securing of water rights on the Stanislaus River along with Oakdale Irrigation District a century ago is responsible for SSJID being one of the best positioned irrigation districts in California in terms of its ability to deliver adequate water for agricultural and urban users as well as to generate clean hydroelectric power. SSJID updates and maintains its extensive irrigation system during the winter season, shortly after the area's almond harvest concludes in October of each year. It is also forging ahead with a state-of-the-art pressurized pipeline system to augment open irrigation canals in the southwest corner of the district south of Manteca. The aim is to reduce the pumping of ground water that has a growing salinity problem, reduce evaporation, cut the use of energy and air pollution, while giving farmers the ability to precisely apply water and nutrients through pressurized drip irrigation systems that in turn can enhance crop production. When the area experienced a drought, the price of produce can be affected throughout the United States. Importance of Affordable Utilities SSJID, as a non-profit utility agency, wants to provide retail electricity to achieve significant cost savings, service improvement and increased reliability to its current agricultural customers, residents, businesses and governmental entities within Manteca, Escalon, Ripon and surrounding rural areas (SSJID's current service territory). Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E;), a for-profit, investor-owned utility currently provides electric service to approximately 40,000 customers in the same service territory. Late in 2009, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously approved a resolution finding that the proposed South San Joaquin Irrigation District (SSJID) plan to purchase PG&E;'s electric facilities in Manteca, Ripon, Escalon and surrounding farm land will not significantly impact the remaining PG&E; electric ratepayers. The San Joaquin Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), requested the approval. The resolution is part of the current San Joaquin LAFCo review process required to be complete before LAFCo can finalize its analysis of SSJID's retail electric plan. In 2013, the LAFCO asked for another study citing that the other studies were obsolete. The SSJID still awaits the LAFCO's approval. The request for extensive studies has raised some controversy with citizens who recall when neighboring Lathrop Irrigation District went into the power business 13 years ago. The LAFCO granted their request to supply power to a potential 11,000 homes in just four months. After 61 months of studies and debate, the San Joaquin LAFCo has scheduled a final meeting on December 10, 2014. As reported in the Manteca Bulletin, \\"The bottom line of the MSR [Municipal Services Review] finding is that the SSJID plan would not cause an increase in retail electrical customer rates within the SSJID service areas. As proposed, SSJID’s plan would reduce customer rates 15 percent compared to PG&E; rates. It also noted projected growth in district reserves should allow SSJID to further lower rates and/or fees for service. If for some reason future conditions do not allow the district to maintain rates 15 percent below PG&E;, the MSR concludes the “SSJID could raise rates to offer a lower discount or to match PG&E; rates without adversely affecting rates that otherwise would have been paid to PG&E.; However, based on financial analysis prepared by Mintner Harnish and MBMC, SSJID’s plan” will be able to deliver the 15 percent discount.\\" Providing power is not new for SSJID. They have offered wholesale electric power through their Tri-Dam Project they operate with Oakdale Irrigation District (OID) to entities like PG&E; since 1957. PG&E; had come to depend on SSJID and OID for inexpensive and reliable electricity that they turned around and sold for a large markup to retail customers. In fact, the cost per kilowatt hour of hydro-power coming from the Tri-Dam Project was significantly lower than what PG&E; could produce on its own at many of its hydroelectric plants.http://www.mantecabulletin.com/section/38/article/117666/ Finally, after 63 months, on December 11, 2014, the LAFCO met in Stockton, California and after two days of deliberation, they approved in a 4-1 vote SSJID's proposal to take over retail electric power in their service area. Negotiations will begin to purchase the equipment from PG&E; and iron out all specifics. 100 Years Strong In 1908, A newspaper was created in to cover the progress of “a large scale water project.” The water project was the South San Joaquin Irrigation District's (SSJID) first endeavor to provide a reliable and affordable source of irrigation water for 72,000 acres of agricultural area surrounding Escalon, Ripon, and Manteca, California. More than 100 years later, the newspaper (then named the “Irrigation Bulletin” now known as “The Manteca Bulletin”) and the SSJID are going strong.

The first years of his patriarchate were marked by the split of the Melkite Church in two factions, a situation that lasted till the Synod of Ras-Baalbek held in 1628 which confirmed Ignatius Atiyah as the only Patriarch and ruled about the independence of the Melchite Church. Ignatius III Atiyah and Cyril IV Dabbas After the death of Athanasius II Dabbas, the Melkite Church split between two claiming Patriarchs, Ignatius III Atiyah and Cyril IV Dabbas, who both were consecrated on the same day, April 24, 1619 but in different places. Ignatius Atiyah started his career as secretary of the Emir Fakhr-al-Din II and in 1605 he became metropolitan of Saida. The Christian people of Damascus, unhappy with the leadership of Dabbas, chose Ignatius and sent him to be consecrated Patriarch of Antioch in Constantinople, where, on April 24, 1619, the Ecumenical Patriarch Timothy II celebrated the ordination. Cyril Dabbas was the brother of the previous Patriarch Athanasius Dabbas and he himself metropolitan of Bosra. He was strongly supported by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, Cyril Lucaris. His consecration as Patriarch was held on April 24, 1619 in Amioun, Lebanon, by the hands of metropolitans Simeon of Hama, Lazaros of Homs and Dionysios of Hosn, under the political influence of the Pasha of Tripoli, Ibn Sifa. The Melkite Church was thus split in two factions: the area of central Syria, including Hama, Homs, Paneas, and politically under the authority of Tripoli, recognized the authority of Cyril Dabbas, while the region of Mount Lebanon, under the Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, as well as the Northern region Aleppo, were faithful to Ignatius Atiyah. This split of the Church not only created discord, but also caused a huge expenditure of money, because both part asked for the formal recognition by the Ottoman sultan who granted it successively to the party who paid more. Initially the situation was in favor of Cyril Dabbas, because his protector, Cyril Lucaris on November 4, 1620 became Patriarch of Constantinople and succeed to get a firman from the Sultan ordering to deport Ignatius to Cyprus and to punish all bishops who did not recognized Cyrill as the sole Patriarch. In 1624 the situation started to change because of the defeat of the Pasha of Tripoli, the main political protector of Cyril, by the Emir Fakhr-al-Din II. Cyrill had to leave Tripoli and moved to Aleppo, where he immediately clashed with the metropolitan of the town, Meletius Karmah, a fierce opponent of him. Cyril succeeded two times to have Meletius imprisoned, but always Meletius, supported by the Christian population of Aleppo, refused to recognize him. Synod of Ras-Baalbek  In order to settle the split of the Melkite Church, in 1628 the Emire Fakhr-al- Din II summoned a synod of all the bishops at Ras-Baalbek, a town a few kilometers north of Baalbek, Lebanon, where the Emire lived. The synod was opened on the June 1st, 1628 in the church of the Blessed Virgin and all the twelve Melchite bishops were present, a part from Cyril Dabbas, who shortly before the synod tried to renounce to the throne in change to an eparchy. The synod proclaimed Ignatius III Atiyah as the only Patriarch, and Cyril Dabbas he was brought in chains to Ras-Baalbek and exiled near Hermel, where shortly later he was executed by men of the Emir. The synod issued twenty canons, which can be so summarized: * canons 1 to 6 deal with the election and consecration of the Patriarch. The synod formally decreed that the patriarch had to be elected by the people, who could define up to three names among which the Patriarch had to be chosen casting lots. The civil confirmation had to be requested only after the decision of the Patriarch. The synod also strictly condemned the external influence of any political party in the process of choosing the Patriarch. It shall be noted that the motivation given to reject the appointment of Cyril Dabbas was that he was not elected by the people of Damascus; * canon 7 condemns the practice of simony, a use quite common particularly to grant the recognition of appointments by the Ottoman authorities, and it deals on the possible income of the Patriarch while conferring sacraments; * canons 8 and 19 are about the qualifications to become priest; * canon 9 deals with illegitimate marriages; * canons 10 and 12 rule the festivals after baptism and marriage; * canon 11 deals with issues about the dowry to be given to a girl; * canon 13 forbids the sacrament of marriage to be conferred outside church buildings; * canon 15 forbids monasteries where lived both men and women; * canons 14 and 16 condemn magicians and heretic books; * canons 17 and 18 condemn priests asking money without proper authorization; * canon 20 forbids lay patriarchal vicars. The regulations set forth by this synod were important in confirming the regularity and legitimacy of the election of the pro-Catholic Cyril Tanas in the 1724 events which led to the split of Melkite Church. Last years After the 1638 Synod of Ras-Baalbek, Ignatius III Atiyah went on reigning for other six years, and he decided to abide mainly at Beirut, near to his protector the Druze Emir Fakhr-al-Din II. In 1633 the Ottoman Sultan started a successful war against the will of independence of the Emir, and Ignatius Atiyah, now without political protection, had to escape from Beirut to Saida. When he tried to return to Beirut dressed up as a soldier, he was shot by a group of druzes and he died immediately. The exact date it is not known, but it was in the early months of 1634.

The company's main objective is to help consumers avoid predatory lenders and brokers, and enable them to obtain safe, fairly priced loans.Fair Mortgage Collaborative: About section Work To combat predatory lending, the Fair Mortgage Collaborative certifies mortgage lenders, brokers, credit unions, and community banks as \\"Fair and Safe\\" based on the “Fair and Safe Lending Standards” they established. These standards were developed, written, and approved by mortgage industry thought leaders; mortgage industry loan officers, brokers, advocates; and other mortgage experts. The standards are strict and the certification process is lengthy. Once the lender is approved, they can place the “Fair Loan Certification” seal on their website and collateral. The Fair Mortgage Collaborative continues to watch each lender's loans to ensure their continuing compliance with the standards. Most recently, with the passing of the Dodd-Frank bill, many of the Fair Mortgage Collaborative's standards have been set into law. However, there is a general apprehension among experts in the home mortgage field that many unscrupulous lenders will continue to find loopholes and abuse consumers. Therefore, the Fair Mortgage Collaborative is currently undergoing some changes to make their organization more consumer and research-focused. They are creating an easy-to-use portal of information to help guide consumers to \\"fair and safe\\" loans. They also plan to participate in mortgage abuse research and publish white papers with their sister non-profit and mortgage advocacy organizations to help keep mortgage lenders fair and safe for everyone. They will also establish the “Fairness Forum”, a social community where borrowers can share information with other lenders in a safe environment. The goal is to help consumers \\"blow the whistle\\" on unfair practices. Staff and board members The Executive Director is Howard Banker, a 30-year mortgage industry veteran, whose most recent position was Vice President of the Opportunity Finance Network.

Pineapple Press, 1998, p. 9.Brown, Alan. Haunted Places in the American South. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2002, p. 77. The modern restaurant was founded by Herb Traub and Jim Casey in 1953, and is one of Savannah's most popular tourist attractions. History Pirates' House, from East Broad Street, in 1984 Pirates' House was built on a plot of land located on the east side of James Oglethorpe's original plan of the city of Savannah. The plot of land was assigned to become a botanical garden that modeled the Chelsea Botanical Garden in London, England. The garden was dedicated to Oglethorpe's trustees. Oglethorpe recruited botanists from around the world to acquire plants for the project, such as cotton, spices, indigo, and medicinal herbs. The garden was hoped to bring success in the wine and silk industries and was centered on growing mulberry trees. The soil and weather conditions of Georgia were not compatible with the mulberry trees and it was not successful with wine or silk; however, it did distribute peach trees, which Georgia is now renowned for. The garden was also highly successful in growing cotton, which later became a staple of Georgia's economy. A small building, which later became the starting structure of Pirates' House, was built on the plot of land in 1734 to house the gardener who worked there. This building was deemed the Herb House and is said to be the oldest building in the state of Georgia. In 1754, the people of Savannah decided the need for the botanical garden was no longer relevant. Savannah was quickly becoming a port town and the Herb House was transformed into an inn and tavern for seamen visiting from abroad. Pirates' House is home to some rare early edition pages of Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson. The pages can be seen hanging on the walls of the captain's room and the treasure room. Renovation and ownership In 1948, Pirates' House and the surrounding land was acquired by The Savannah Gas Company. The building soon caught the interest of Mrs. Hansell Hilyer, wife of the president of the company. She renewed the house museum into the restaurant of the present day. Pirates' House has fifteen dining rooms, can hold up to 120 guests, and serves a variety of southern dishes.

It is listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties and on the National Register of Historic Places. It has subsequently been torn down. History The original St. Luke's Hospital building after 1903. In 1892 the Rt. Rev. William Stevens Perry, the second Bishop of Iowa proposed the establishment of a hospital in Davenport. The diocese had previously started hospitals in Des Moines (1878) and in Cedar Rapids (1884). Funding for the new hospital in Davenport came from money left in an account for the defunct Iowa Christian Home, which amounted to $10,176.45. With the money, the Trustees of the Iowa Christian Home purchased the Daniel Newcomb residence on Eighth Street. A 20-bed hospital was created after spending $1,600 to remodel the house. St. Luke's Hospital formally opened on April 30, 1885. A few years later (the exact date is in dispute), an addition that tripled the building's size was constructed on the north side of the old house. Of the 22-member Board of Managers for the hospital, 13 members were women, with Mrs. Walter Chambers serving as its first president. Women would serve as the hospital's chief officer until 1946. St. Luke's was the city's second hospital after Mercy Hospital, which was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of the Catholic Church in 1869. St. Luke's was meant as an emergency facility to complement Mercy, which was a long-term care faculty. The operating room for the hospital was on the second floor. The day's weather determined if surgery would be held on any given day. If it was sunny there was enough light and surgery would proceed. If it was overcast, surgery had to be postponed. Doctors and nurses did not wear surgical masks and a relative of the patient was allowed into the room during surgery in street clothes. The Davenport Training School for Nurses was begun at the hospital on August 27, 1895, and changed its name to St. Luke's Hospital Training School two years later. In 1903 the hospital added space for an additional 50 patients as well as modern operating rooms. By 1909 the hospital was treating 356 patients. Changes in the operating rooms included doctors and nurse wearing surgical gowns, gloves and the instruments were sterilized. The fee for major surgery had doubled to $10 from the 1895 rate. The hospital became a charter member of the American Hospital Association in 1918. It also expanded the same year by building a new facility at Bridge and High Streets. The Eighth Street location was abandoned when the new hospital opened in December 1919. The old building was converted to apartments. Major expansions occurred at the hospital in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. St. Luke's worked toward consolidating with Mercy Hospital in 1975 and 1976, but in the end, they remained separate. Finally, in 1993 it was decided to merge the two hospitals. On May 24, 1994 Genesis Health System was created.Horton, 122 This building remained an apartment building, with 28 units, into the 21st century. It was acquired by Palmer College of Chiropractic and torn down in 2017. Architecture The Daniel Newcomb House, which became St. Luke's Hospital, was built in the Italianate style in 1850. It is built of red brick with a shallow hipped roof, bracketed eaves, and a belvedere on the top of the roof. The 1903 addition was built to complement the older building. The pitch of the roof, however, is steeper and it includes dormers at various points. It is also a little simpler in design without the bracketed eaves. The T-plan wing nearly tripled the available floor space, and at the same time the house probably lost many of its notable exterior features. with References External links Episcopal Diocese of Iowa Buildings and structures in Davenport, Iowa Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa National Register of Historic Places in Davenport, Iowa Davenport Register of Historic Properties Houses completed in 1850 Hospital buildings completed in 1903 1850 establishments in Iowa Demolished buildings and structures in Iowa Buildings and structures demolished in 2017 ","title":"St. Luke's Hospital (Davenport, Iowa)"},{"id":"28971801","text":"Begum Ishrat Ashraf is a Pakistani politician who has been a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan between 1985 and 2013.

Locally, it is commonly referred to simply as the Sick Kids. The hospital provides emergency care for children from birth to the 13th birthday, including a specialist Accident and Emergency facility. Some in patient specialities will see children up to the 16th birthday. The hospital is located on Sciennes Road in the Sciennes area of Edinburgh's South Side. It is managed by NHS Lothian. History Royal Arms carving over the main entrance The hospital, which opened at 7 Lauriston Lane in 1860, was the first dedicated children's hospital in Scotland. It received a royal charter in 1863, when it moved to the Meadowside House. The conversion of the house into a hospital was carried out by the architect David Macgibbon. In 1890 an outbreak of typhoid forced a temporary removal to Plewlands House, Morningside, and Meadowside House was subsequently sold. The site of the Trades Maiden Hospital (established by Mary Erskine) at Rillbank was bought in the early 1890s, and plans for a new hospital were put in hand to designs by George Washington Browne. The Sciennes Road building cost £50,000 was opened on 31 October 1895 by Princess Beatrice. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. In February 2015 construction work began on the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People at Little France which will replace the current hospital. In December 2016 the existing site was offered for sale as a development opportunity with the expectation of significant interest. In September 2017 NHS Lothian decided to sell the site to the Downing Group, a Liverpool-based property developer.

It is set to transmit and receive on the UHF radio band. It is currently held and maintained by its founder: Repeatergruppen SK7MQ, known as a part of \\"Österlens sändaramatörer\\". History SK7MQ or also known as SK7RNQ B, is a complementary UHF repeater to the SK7RNQ C repeater which is transmitting on the 2m radio band. SK7MQ had its first launch in July 2010, and was on 25 September 2010 that the gateway was connected to the US Trust Server network, making it possible to establish worldwide connections between other D-STAR gateway enabled repeaters through TCP/IP. The first transatlantic D-STAR QSO on SK7MQ were made between SA7BOS and KC5NID at September 27, 2010 via Reflector 001-C, also known as the \\"D-STAR Mega Repeater\\". As of 2011, Repeatergruppen SK7RNQ is the fastest deploying D-STAR group within Sweden, currently owning and maintaining two RP2C controlled D-STAR repeaters and one experimental GMSK HotSpot. In the middle of March 2011, the first 23 cm D-STAR repeater in northern Europe will be installed in Malmö Municipality, Sweden by Repeatergruppen SK7MQ. The repeater will act as a pure PS (Digital Data) repeater, and will at first be experimentally used by SA7BOS and SM7ZDV through the use of the ICOM-ID 23 cm transceiver. In addition to the 23 cm repeater, a 70 cm D-STAR repeater will be installed at the same QTH with the aim to provide portable D-STAR users full coverage within Malmö. Technical information Maintenance work on the antenna tower The SK7MQ repeater is transmitting on 434.47500 MHz (a.k.a. the 70-centimeter band) with a negative offset by 2 MHz. The antenna position height is 120 meters over sea level. The gateway hardware for the D-STAR transmitting system is the ID-RP2C connector unit in combination with the ID-RP4000V UHF DV Exciter. At first the repeater gave out a measured effect of 25W, but a recently added PA increased the effect to 90W, improving the packet loss resistance and thus extending the transmitted range. The D-STAR gateway has its default reflector set to REF-031A, which collects all district 7 repeaters (southern part within Sweden) into one unique intranet. By a simple metadata command, the repeater can switch between REF-031B or C for instant coverage of the middle or northern districts. In order to be able to use the D-STAR gateway on the repeater, each HAM operator must apply for an approval within the US Trust Server network, which is done at the registration webpage at any US Trust Server connected gateway repeater. By doing so, the system becomes much more prone to un-authorized users and non-licensed operators. SK7MQ Administrators SM7ZDV (Christian Nilsson) - Team / project leader, head of promotion.

(; ; b. ِ6 August 1943) is an Iraq-Iranian Shia jurist.  Early life and education  al-Shirazi was born to Mirza Mahdi al-Shirazi and Halima al-Shirazi. Both of his parents are from the distinguished clerical al-Shirazi family that emigrated from Shiraz to Karbala in the 19th century. He is the tenth of ten children. All of his brothers are clerics, and his brothers' Muhammad al-Shirazis and Sadiq al- Shirazi are marja's. His mother is the great-granddaughter of Mirza Shirazi, the pioneer of the Tobacco Movement. His nephew, Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi is also a marja'. = Education = He grew up in Karbala, and studied in its seminary under his father, his older brother, Muhammad al-Shirazi and senior scholars like Sheikh Muhammad al-Hajiri and Sheikh Yusuf al-Khorasani. He moved to Najaf to complete his advanced studies, and studied under Sayyid Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, as well as the founder of the Islamic republic of Iran, Sayyid Ruhollah Khomeini. He was exiled from Iraq and migrated to Iran, after the success of the Iranian revolution. He remained in Qom for a short while, and then moved to Mashhad, where he taught in its seminaries.  Relationship with Khomeini  In Najaf, al-Shirazi attended the bahth kharij (advanced research seminars) classes of Khomeini, and from there on, he grew in close proximity with Khomeini. He would also go as far as being known as the \\"only Arab supporting Khomeini\\" in the Najaf seminary. He was granted ijtihad by Khomeini. al-Shirazi would write numerous verses of poetry supporting the Islamic republic, as well as poems in praise of Khomeini personally, the most known one being: al-Shirazi believed Khomeini to be senior to al-Khoei.  Immigration to the United Kingdom  al-Shirazi wasn't really affiliated with any of his marja' brothers, in fact ever since the inception of his religious education, he held relatively differing views to them, and took under the wing of Khomeini throughout the majority of his stay in Iraq. However, when the Shirazi's landed in Iran, and the disputes between his brother and Khomeini surfaced, al-Shirazi also began to harvest a dispute with Khomeini, but it was over his Sufi tendencies that al-Shirazi deemed deviance and kufr. Due to family ties, and his differences on Islamic philosophy with Khomeini, al- Shirazi naturally became affiliated with his brother. Hence, after facing much pressures and discomfort in Mashhad, with some reports going as far as to say that al-Shirazi's house was at some point raided, whilst he was taken and tortured, he left Mashhad for London in 1994.  al-Baqi' 2009 protest  On 20 February 2009, Shia pilgrims gathered in Medina, at the al-Baqi' cemetery, to mark the anniversary of Prophet Muhammad's death. However, an incident took place where the religious police videotaped female pilgrims, a practice that was found offensive, and so a group of men asked the police to destroy or hand over the tapes, but they were denied. In response, on 24 February, many pilgrims gathered and protested in front of the cemetery and so the religious police began to attack them, and then the police interfered, arresting and injuring dozens of the pilgrims, as well as beating and assaulting them with knives. al-Shirazi released a very strong statement in the form a video, attacking the Saudi government, and King Abdullah personally. He called for the masjid al-haram and masjid al-nabawi, to be taken under management of the United Nations, and for the independence of the Eastern province, with its own sovereignty, referencing the independence of Pakistan from India. In response, there was a large uproar from the Saudi media towards al-Shirazi. al-Shirazi and his student, controversial Kuwaiti cleric, Sheikh Yasser al-Habib, were accused of provoking terror attacks against Sunni mosques, as a reaction to the al-Baqi' incident and the bombings (2006 and 2007) of the Askariayn shrine. However, al-Habib denied this, claiming: > \\"this was a call for the mosques–satanic temples–that are proven to be dens > of criminal Wahabis and terrorists; the ones that call for the slaughter of > the Shia. As for the ordinary Sunni mosques, it is strictly forbidden to be > destroyed, even if it is a Bakri [Sunni] mosque.\\"  Controversy  al-Shirazi adopted an insulting rhetoric towards Iran’s politicians and their supporters and is never hesitant of using obscene language towards his political rivals and opponents from different Islamic sects. This rhetoric also extended to the use of profane words when condemning the Saudi government for the al-Baqi' 2009 incident.  Fall out with al-Habib  al-Shirazi was considered a mentor to al-Habib. However, they had a fall out in 2012, and are no longer affiliated.  Works  al-Shirazi has published numerous lectures and books about jurisprudence, principles of jurisprudence, Islamic philosophy and Sufism. Some of his works include: = Lectures = * al-Falsafa wal-Irfan (Islamic Philosophy and Gnosis). These are considered the largest chain of lectures on Gnosis and Sufism, as well as figures of Islamic mysticism. * al-Sira al-Nabawiya (Biography of Muhammad) * al-Sira al-Alawiya (Biography of Ali) * al-Sira al-Sajadiya (Biography of Ali ibn al-Husayn) * al-Sira al-Baqiriya (Biography of Muhammad ibn Ali) * Ahl al- Bayt Fi al-Quran (Ahl al-Bayt in the Quran) * Abu Bakr Fi al-Hadith (Abu Bakr in Hadith) = Books = * Falsafat Ta'adud al-Zawjat (The Islamic Philosophy of Polygamy) * Ijtima'iyat al-Islam (Islamic Sociology) * Hadhara Bari'a (Innocent Civilization) * Hatha Rasool Allah (This is the Messenger of Allah) * Diwan (Poetry collection)  Personal life  al-Shirazi is married to the daughter of Ayatollah Sayyid Ahmed Khatami, a contemporary of his father. He has two daughters and one son. His son Mustafa is a cleric, and is married to Yasser al-Habib's sister.

Orphans has reached many fans beyond the typical theater crowd. Lou Reed is an outspoken admirer of the play, and Tom Waits, who had his own play, Frank's Wild Years, done at Steppenwolf, also directed by Gary Sinise, was reportedly so moved by Orphans that, at its conclusion, long after all the rest of the audience had left, he sat in his seat, too overwhelmed by the experience to get up. The play was adapted into a film of the same name. The film stars Matthew Modine, Albert Finney and Kevin Anderson. According to Kessler, \\"The play has been done everywhere, from Japan to Iceland to Mexico to South America.... It just boggles the mind. It’s amazing: the evolution of the play and its reception in the world.\\"  Synopsis  Two grown orphan brothers live in an old dilapidated row house in North Philadelphia--deserted in childhood by an unfaithful father and by the death of their mother. Older brother Treat, brutal and violent, provides for his younger brother Phillip by being a petty thief--interpreting the role of father. With the love and protectiveness of an older brother and an orphan's fear of abandonment, Treat takes away Phillip's chances to grow up, depriving him of knowledge and forcing him to live in a world of illiteracy and innocence: relegating him to their lost childhood. As Treat is out stealing to put food on the table, Phillip never leaves the house, thinking he will die from something outside because of a near deadly allergic reaction he had as a child. Haunted by the death of their mother, he spends his time lying in her closet filled with unworn clothes. Curious about the world, he secretly attempts to understand things by watching reruns of The Price Is Right and underlining words in newspapers and old books he finds lying around. Treat kidnaps and ties up a Chicago gangster named Harold. Harold, an orphan himself, with the prowess of an escape artist, loosens the ties that bind him, turns the tables around, and with gun in hand, puts himself into the role of teacher, healer and surrogate parent.  Critical reception  A 1985 review of Sinise's production, by The Record, compared the play with the 1955 black comedy film The Ladykillers and the 1958 Italian criminal-comedy film Big Deal on Madonna Street and wrote, \\"while one might be tempted to chuckle at Kessler's old-fashioned dramaturgy, it's a fine example of its kind and gorgeously performed by a cast of three under the direction of Gary Sinise... Sinise has staged the piece in a realistic idiom with highly theatrical accents lifelike scenes that begin and end in tableaux, actors throwing themselves around like rag dolls, extravagantly long pauses...\\" The play was described by The New York Times as \\"theater for the senses and emotions.\\" T.H. McCulloh of the Los Angeles Times wrote it is \\"just as wise and knowledgeable about the human condition\\" as Tennessee Williams and \\"also as theatrical as Williams. Kessler has something very important to say, and he says it in terms we can't ignore. The biggest message is that we need each other, and that's something the viewer can't ignore....\\" Tony Adler of the Chicago Reader declared, \\"Lyle Kessler's unassuming tale of two nearly feral brothers and the mysterious businessman who befriends them was and remains among the most devastating things I've seen onstage.\\" John Simon wrote in the National Review, \\"The play was a synthetic contraption out of Pinter and Sam Shepard, but it worked as a showcase for energetic actors and a clever director.\\" The Miami Herald wrote about a 1986 production starring Judd Nelson that the play is \\"tense, moving and funny as anything you're likely to see.\\" The reviewer said, \\"Orphans is woven from mysteries, contradictions and unanswered questions,\\" and concluded, \\"Orphans is violent, shocking and profane. And it's wonderful.\\"  Genre  Lyle Kessler's Orphans, among many of his other pieces of literature, has been praised as a hybrid of 20th century realism, Pinter-esque absurdism, and Shakespearean tragedy, but in many ways it aligns itself better with the literary tradition of Magical Realism, a more prevalent genre in Latin American countries than in the North American theatre. The way Orphans can move from a hyper realistic state into a parable while still maintaining its emotional pull and deeply felt sense of reality goes well with what magical realism is understood to be--magical elements blended into a realistic atmosphere in order to access a deeper understanding of reality. The American theatrical tradition tends not to embrace these perceived contradictions as readily. An expressionistic play is expected to be cerebral and conceptual, not visceral. A realistic play is expected to maintain the same logic that one sees in the outside world. But, like Franz Kafka, Kessler grasps for a reality that is felt within us but doesn't always obey the logic outside of its own prescribed universe.  Direction  Orphans has been applauded for its lack of dependence on one particular theatrical approach. As said by Los Angeles Times critic Scott Collins when reviewing a Deaf West Theatre Company production in 1996, \\"Whatever the medium, the viewer finds it hard not to be drawn into the emotional journey...\\" This production of Orphans, by the first sign language theater in the western United States, went on to be a Critic's Choice from the Drama-Logue newspaper and Joseph Dean Anderson's performance as Phillip won him a 6th Annual Ticket Holder's Award under the New Discoveries category. Further praise for Kessler's ability to create something with such flexibility, while still taking people on its \\"emotional journey,\\" came from a 2007 production of Orphans at the Penguin Repertory Company in Stony Point, Rockland County, New York. The New York Times critic Sylviane Gold called the production a \\"splendid revival\\", and wrote: \\"...it is strange to say about a play that burst into New York from Chicago in 1985 on the strength of the testosterone-fueled acting of the Steppenwolf Theater Company\\" that it can be directed \\"with as much attention to the play's heart as to its fist.\\"Gold, Sylviane. \\"Theater Review. When a Stranger Brings a Mother’s Touch\\" New York Times, July 15, 2007 In Japan, Orphans premiered in 1991 by a \\"Tokyo style\\" theater group,Kaze kaze-net.org going on to have a nationwide tour and performing continually in theaters around Japan ever since, including the internationally renowned Kaze Theater Troupe. Its success illustrates the play's ability to harmonize with different theatrical variations as well as cultural traditions. In Korea, it premiered in 2017. Its revival is in 2019, with 3 female actors playing Harold, Treat, and Philip. This is to be the first gender free version of Orphans. The drama's ability to maintain its inherent emotional pull regardless of its theatrical approach is one of the reasons for its continued success.

Life and achievements Thomas M. Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor. Paul was born on April 18, 1893, in Philadelphia. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1915 from Princeton University and received his medical training at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, which awarded him an M.D. degree.Staff. \\"Dr. John Paul, Polio Researcher, Dies\\", The New York Times, May 7, 1971. Accessed September 27, 2010. He began his career as an assistant pathologist at Johns Hopkins in 1919 and 1920, and followed that with an internship at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia from 1920 to 1922. In 1928, Paul joined the faculty of the Yale School of Medicine as a professor of internal medicine and held the position of professor of preventive medicine starting in 1940, which he retained until his retirement. Paul established the Yale Poliomyelitis Study Unit in 1931 together with James D. Trask, advancing the concept of \\"clinical epidemiology\\" in which the path of disease outbreaks in small communities was directly studied. Together with Trask, Paul received the first grant from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (better known as the March of Dimes), which was renewed each year for another 30 years. As part of the study unit, Paul went to Middletown, Connecticut and New Haven into neighborhoods where polio was spreading and collected samples from patients in an effort to understand how the virus spread. Paul's team found that poliovirus was excreted by people afflicted with the condition and could be found in sewage in areas that had experienced outbreaks. In a 1951 article published in The New York Times Magazine in 1951, Paul noted the improvements that had been made in treating and relieving pain in those afflicted with polio, but lamented the lack of progress in prevention of polio. He travelled to the Soviet Union in 1956 as part of a group of five doctors who visited medical facilities there. Paul's research also included work on hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis and rheumatic fever. After his retirement from the medical school in 1961, he continued to lecture on the history of medicine. Paul became a professor emeritus in 1961 and until 1966, served as the director of the World Health Organization Serum Reference Bank located in the Yale Department of Epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. As a member of the polio advisory committee of the United States Public Health Service, Paul joined in a 1962 recommendation that the use of an oral polio vaccine created by Albert B. Sabin in treating adults should be halted based on the lack of clinical evidence showing that the vaccine prevented those receiving the vaccine from developing the disease. In his 1971 book A History of Poliomyelitis, Paul put forth the proposition that humans had always been exposed to poliovirus but had been protected by antibodies contained in the mothers milk, and that it was the clean water, sewer systems and improved hygiene of modern civilization that prevented children from being exposed to the virus at an early age, hypothesizing that protection would be conferred if people were exposed to the virus as infants.Orent, Wendy. \\"Still a Scourge\\" , proto: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.

Reception =Reviews= * ‘Feeling Fine’ hears the Scottish lad skilfully manoeuvre around the verses in a falsetto, recalling the tenderness of his ballad ‘There Goes My Heart’. Much like my impressions of Girls Aloud‘s ‘Crocodile Tears’, ‘Feeling Fine’ didn’t strike me as a potential until I woke up one morning with its chorus ringing in my head. Ta-dah! We have another slow-revealing Xenomania pop gem at hand. - Feed Limmyhttp://xenomanianews.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-gardner-feeling- fine-reviews.html * ‘Feeling Fine’ is a heady blend of electronica, R’n’B and dancefloor flavours wrapped up in a perfect pop package and showcases Alex’s accomplished, soul-packed vocal, which impressively swoops up to giddy falsetto heights. - Female Firsthttp://xenomanianews.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-gardner-feeling-fine- reviews.html * “Feeling Fine” follows the lead of “I’m not Mad” as another top Xenomania tune. Granted, I have no idea what the hell he’s saying on the Ke$ha-fied chorus, but I know that I like it. No, scratch that – I love it. Naturally, Alex’s voice is built for acoustic rock and blue-eyed soul, so hearing his raspy vocals against the sleek backdrop of Xenomania’s perfect productions completely adds new dimensions to tunes that may have sounded a lot more standard in the hands of somebody else. - The Prophet Bloghttp://xenomanianews.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-gardner-feeling-fine- reviews.html Track listing 1\\\\. \\"Feeling Fine\\" - 3:38 2\\\\. \\"I Wanna Be With Her\\"  References  2010 singles Alex Gardner (singer) songs Song recordings produced by Xenomania Songs written by Brian Higgins (producer) 2010 songs A&M; Records singles ","title":"Feeling Fine"},{"id":"28972108","text":"Stade Municipal de Avrankou is a multi-use stadium in Avrankou, Benin.

James, included in his 1904 collection Ghost Stories of an Antiquary. Plot summary In 1690, the county of Suffolk is wracked with a fear of witches. Many girls and women are accused of casting spells and causing mayhem. One such accused woman is a Mrs. Mothersole, a wealthier noblewoman who has property of her own. The only evidence of her witchcraft are eyewitness accounts by Sir Matthew Fell, the owner of a local seat named Castringham. Outside his bedroom window grows a monstrous ash tree, where on moonlit nights he would sometimes supposedly see Mrs. Mothersole climbing the trunk and snipping branches with a dagger. She always escaped and disappeared before he could catch her. Despite her pleas, she is found guilty and hanged. Before the noose is pulled, she dully intones \\"There will be guests at the Hall\\". She is buried in the local cemetery. A few weeks later, Sir Matthew and the local vicar are walking by the ash tree at dusk when they spy a creature in the branches that disappears before they can get a good look. As it is a warm night, the squire leaves his window open. The next day, he is found dead in his bed with a severe look of pain and terror on his face. Though an autopsy is performed, no cause of death can be found. Sir Matthew's son, Sir Matthew II, inherits Castringham and refuses to stay in his father's bedroom. Over forty years pass and he passes away in 1735. When the family plot in the local cemetery needs to be expanded to fit his remains, Mrs. Mothersole's resting place is exhumed to make room and the coffin is found to be empty, with no body. The locals are puzzled as to who could have robbed the grave. Sir Matthew II's son, Sir Richard, inherits the seat and also refuses to stay in the supposedly cursed bedroom. In 1754, however, he grows tired of the alternate chamber he chose, as it is cold and smoky. He orders his housekeeper to move his bed into the room where his grandfather died decades previously. That night, he keeps his window closed but hears something scratching on it. The next day, he is visited by the grandson of the vicar from all those years ago, now a vicar himself. They chat about Sir Matthew's death and discover an old bible of his, where he has written down his desire for the ash tree to be felled. Sir Richard assures the vicar a man from the village will come the next day and dispose of it. He remarks on the strange scratching noises from the window the night previously, blaming the sounds on the branches scraping the glass. The vicar says this is impossible, as the branches don't reach the window. They conclude it must have been a mouse that climbed the ivy. That evening, several guests arrive for a weekend visit and the evening passes successfully. Everyone retires to their rooms. In the middle of the night, something climbs through Sir Richard's open window and bites him. The next morning, he is found dead in bed and the guests congregate to discover the secret of the tree. A gardener climbs a ladder and peeks into a hollow in the center, seeing something that causes him to drop his lantern in alarm and set the tree ablaze. The guests watch in horror as countless large, venomous spiders crawl out of the hollow on fire, dying on the grass. An investigation of the tree reveals a cave beneath it with a cavernous spider's nest and the withered skeleton of a woman (presumably the remains of Mrs. Mothersole), dead for at least fifty years. Adaptations It was adapted in 1975 by David Rudkin as \\"The Ash Tree\\", and was part of the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas strand. It was first broadcast on 23 December 1975 at 11.35pm.

There are a number of intermediate halts and a station and depot at the town of Camilo Cienfuegos, better known by its pre-revolutionary name of Hershey. The railway is the only surviving electric line in Cuba. The railway was built by The Hershey Company to transport sugar to the port of Havana. The original electric interurban cars were bought from the J. G. Brill Company, but these were replaced by cars from the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya in the 1990s. Overview Train waiting to depart at Havana Casablanca station There are usually three trains per day, each way between Havana Casablanca and Matanzas, meeting at Hershey Station, the midpoint. The early morning and later afternoon trains allow commuters to go to work at the end-points, the mid-day provides supplementary service. The end-to-end time is approximately 3 1/2 hours. The service can be irregular and journeys may be truncated without prior notice. The main stops are at Guanabo, Hershey, San Mateo, Jibaco, Canasi, San Antonio and Matanzas, which have modest station buildings. There are also other stops with small platforms and there can be numerous intermediate halts at road crossings serviced on demand. There are four branches from the main line in current use, running to Playas del Este, Jaruco, Bainoa and Santa Cruz del Norte. There is local passenger service from Calle 7 Station in Hershey (near the maintenance facility) to San Antonio de Rio Blanco and Jaruco. There may also still be local passenger service from Hershey Station to Caraballo on the Bainoa branch. These are rarely used since 2000, but in the summer months, diesel hauled excursion trains run from Havana's La Coubre station to Playas del Este, a popular destination for city dwellers. Other branches exists but have not been used in recent years. The branch to the Havana Club dark rum factory in Santa Cruz del Norte is no longer electrified and tank cars of molasses are delivered by diesel locomotives running out of Matanzas. The maintenance facility is in Hershey, near the Callé 7 platforms, and the remains of the Hershey sugar refinery. Apparently one or more Brill cars are stored there for occasional tourist use, along with a GE steeple cab locomotive and a tower car to maintain the overhead catenary lines. Line voltage is 1200 volts DC. Ties are concrete, rails are jointed (not continuous/welded) and power poles wooden, usually on the south side. To minimize construction costs, the scenic roadbed tends to follow the contours of the land, with many curves to minimize grades. The line serves communities and regions roughly midway between the Carretera Central and coastal Via Blanca highways, between Havana and Matanzas. These areas would otherwise have no public transportation and poor road service. When the Hershey line was constructed circa 1916, largely to support the Hershey sugar refinery, the main railway operator in Havana province, United Railways, refused to allow the Hershey train access to its tracks so a new terminus was built at Casablanca, which is across the harbour from Habana Vieja, connected by a ferry service.

The hotel was officially opened in May 2009 after EUR 42 million reconstruction of former spa house complex Hviezdoslav. Grand Hotel Kempinski High Tatras offers 98 rooms and suites (including Presidential and Honeymoon suite). It also offers Spa & Wellness services. Location The hotel is located in the immediate proximity of the alpine lake Štrbské pleso, which is situated at an elevation of 1,351 metres (4432 feet) above sea level. History The current Grand Hotel Kempinski High Tatras consists of three interlinked historical buildings built over a period of 34 years, one next to another, on the Štrbské Pleso moraine: Jánošík (1893), Kriváň (1906) and Hviezdoslav (1923). They are distinguished by their varied architectural forms, which range from historicist design to the modern style of the 1920s. Together, they give the impression of picturesque and quaint construction, with various roof shapes that contribute to the panorama of the surrounding Tatras peaks. The oldest building, dating back to 1893 is Jánošík. Originally, Jozef Szentiványi had it built for his own needs and named it Jozef's villa. The romantic small villa, decorated with paintings and engravings on its facades and with richly furnished interiors, was visited by the highest levels of the aristocracy. Guests included several family members of the House of Habsburg and the House of Coburg, the King of Serbia - Milan and others. After the creation and foundation of Czechoslovakia, the villa was given the name Jánošík, after the Slovak's national hero. Over the time, other buildings have been connected to the original building, including Kriváň (completed in 1906) and Hviezdoslav (completed in 1923). Kriváň ranked among the three grand hotels of the Tatras at the time of its creation. The project was developed by the renowned architect Guido Hoepfner in cooperation with Géza Györgyi in the era of Belle Époque, an era dominated by the Secession style and thus the hotel, including all the furnishings, was designed in this style. The hotel also included spas. Archduke Charles Stephen and his family were among the first guests of the grand hotel; he was astonished in particular at the hotel hall and restaurant. After the foundation of Czechoslovakia, the hotel was renamed Kriváň, after the Slovaks' national peak. Grand Hotel Hviezdoslav was opened in 1923 and bears the name of the greatest Slovak poet. The interior furnishings of the hotel were designed by prominent designers of the unique style known as Rondo-Cubism, the Czechoslovak national style at that time. Before the FIS World Cup IN 1935, the old tourist restaurant was replaced by a new French style dining room and bar, which according to the contemporary critics was without equal in all the Tatras. Starting in 1953, the hotel complex was used as a sanatorium before gradually falling into disrepair and finally, because of its poor condition, being closed. =Reconstruction of the complex in 2003 - 2007= In 2003, architect Peter Černo prepared a new study of the reconstruction and building of the former treatment house Hviezdoslav. The aim of the project was to transform the historically protected old buildings (from a central list of registered monuments in 1963) into a luxurious five-star hotel that met the expectations and requirements of the future operator - Kempinski. When modifying the exterior, this ambition was to be as close to the original historic appearance as possible. During the preparations, he sought archival materials, historical photos and other documents, all of which were used during the reconstruction.

Since the early 16th century, the site had been the location of the Monastery of San Francisco. The central garden of the park features enormous araucaria trees, some of which were brought to México as a present to Porfirio Díaz by the ambassador from Chile, sometime before the inauguration of the park in 1892. The southern side of the park looks over the valley below, offering scenic views of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains: Cofre de Perote to the West and snowcapped Pico de Orizaba to the South. In 1922, the Junta de Obras Materiales de Jalapa, presided by William K. Boone, proposed, designed and built a ramp to make it easier for vehicles to reach the center of the city from the (old) train station. In 1930, the ramp del Parque Juárez was renamed Paseo del Ayuntamiento and later Paseo de la Constitución.

He was described as \\"second only in popularity to Chaplin in Britain at the height of his career,\\" and as displaying \\"a proto-Pythonesque humour of the absurd.\\" Critic Barry Anthony wrote that \\"in many ways the topical skits of Pimple have more in common with The Crazy Gang, Benny Hill, the Goons, Monty Python or topical sketch shows like French and Saunders and The Fast Show than with the classic Hollywood silent comedies.\\" Biography Evans was born in London into a family of music hall and circus performers. His grandfather, also named Fred Evans, was a popular clown who staged harlequinades; his uncle Will Evans was a leading music hall comedian; and his parents were members of several touring musical troupes. He was a childhood friend of Charlie Chaplin, and as a child performed with his brother Joe as part of his parents' pantomime act, the Florador Quartet. Fred and Joe then worked together and individually in music hall, and for Sanger's Circus, before joining filmmakers Cricks and Martin in 1910. Evans' early screen appearances were as Charley Smiler, a disaster-prone 'dude' character dressed in frock coat, waistcoat and spats. In 1912, Fred and Joe Evans began working at the Ec-Ko studios in Teddington, and set up their own production company, Folly Films. Unable to use the Charley Smiler character because of legal threats from Cricks and Martin, Evans devised a new character, Pimple, an accident-prone clown with a tight jacket, baggy pants, big boots, cricket cap, and lank strands of hair around a central parting. The films were scripted by Joe Evans. Early films were often chases; in Pimple and the Snake (1912), Pimple tries to retrieve a snake that has escaped from the zoo, but instead chases a lady's feather boa, causing chaos. By 1913, the comedies were increasingly spoofs of popular films, plays and novels. For example, a series of Lieutenant Pimple films poked fun at the screen exploits of the swashbuckling Lieutenant Daring, hero of more serious melodramas. Pimple's Battle of Waterloo (1913) was a merciless parody of the recent epic film The Battle of Waterloo, which had been characterised by location filming and (for the period) lavish production values. Pimple's version made a virtue of its low-budget filming in the backyard of their premises at Eel Pie Island to ridicule the earlier production. p. 19 In Pimple in The Whip (1917), another parody, the Evans brothers used pantomime horses and a man wearing a horse head and carrying a stick in each hand to represent the front legs, to re-enact the original movie's thrilling race scenes. The films also made use of jokey and punning intertitles. The films were extremely successful in Britain, and by 1915 the Evans brothers were producing some six titles each month, most of which are now lost. Evans promoted the films by travelling around the country to present them, sometimes also performing a live act as part of a mixed programme. He also toured as part of an Army campaign to promote and raise funds for servicemen fighting the war, but in 1916 received a medical discharge from the forces. He continued to make films but his popularity declined. He returned to performing in the music halls, and had his performances filmed, but was declared bankrupt in 1920. His last films were made in 1922. Evans later appeared in revues with his wife and daughters, and worked as a film extra in the 1930s, eventually reuniting with his brother Joe – who had worked in the United States – to present a puppet show in the Second World War. He died in 1951 after performing in a circus.

Early life, education, and exile Katjiuongua attended primary school in Aminuis, and from 1956 to 1959 the Swedish Confederation of Labour college in Bechuanaland (now Botswana). His political activities continued concurrently with his studies. After graduation, he went into exile to work in the South West African National Union (SWANU) office in Cairo, Egypt. From 1961 to 1962 he studied journalism in Magdeburg, East Germany on a SWANU bursary. Katjiuongua met Mao Zedong during a trip to China after 1963.

The location is . It is located in the southern province of the country, around 2500 m. altitude on the mountains bordering the equatorial forest of Nyungwe. The territory is mostly covered by forest and is intensively cultivated by the population. The climate is equatorial, with heavy and abundant rains from February to April and during the period between September and November, while the period between June and August, the most critical for the population, is characterized by drought. Description From Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, to reach Gatare, it takes about 4 to 6 hours' drive, of which 2 to 4 is on a very difficult road. The population of Gatare is large (about 20,000 inhabitants) and consists mostly of ethnic Hutu, in small part by people of Tutsi ethnicity, and in minority by pygmies (Twa). The social composition is strongly influenced by the dramatic situations due to the civil war of 1994. Part of the population has migrated from other areas, part consists of resettled refugees, coming from different areas. The houses are scattered on the hills or concentrated in villages or towns. The households are on average six people. Authorities are trying to create conditions favoring the establishment of social mechanisms of association. Culture Most of the population lives on agriculture and farming. The crops most suited to the area are potatoes, peas, cabbage, wheat and tea. The Rwandan government is favoring the growth of tea plantations with the construction of nurseries for small plants and the construction of processing centers of the crop. The land is not fertile and it is always necessary to use additives to fertilize. Very little part of the population benefits of a monthly salary, often wholly inadequate and poverty is widespread. Infrastructure Extremely low is the presence of infrastructure. Just one road links the region with the city of Nyamagabe (former Gikongoro) that is only paved for a stretch (requiring the use of off-road cars) and sometimes prohibitive, especially after the heavy equatorial rains. Schooling In the region there is the opportunity to attend pre-school, primary and secondary schools. A particularly significant role is played by the mission of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, who run a nursery school that houses over 400 children and a Health Center (Rugege).

In 1733, Abel Smith and his wife Deborah moved from Great Neck to Secaucus, where he bought a large tract of land and constructed a large mansion.New York Genealogical and Biographical Society (1922), p. 14. The first burial on the grounds was that of Abel Smith himself, who died in 1755. The Smith family farm was approximately , consisting of meadowland and toward the upland of western Hudson Palisades. The Smith family owned the plot from the 18th century until the early 20th century. The property was passed down through the generations, and as a result, many of the burials were of the Smith family themselves. However, a few other families were buried there over the course of its use as a cemetery, namely the Post and Earle families.New York Genealogical and Biographical Society (1947), p. 132. In the year 1875, \\"Jack\\" Jackson, who was described as the last slave in New Jersey, died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm.

These were reserved for the Smith family.New York Genealogical and Biographical Society (1947), p. 133.

After the sale to the respective companies, a proposal was aired to turn the grounds into a park.Home News Publication In 1948, a Secaucus librarian named Marion Dudley also supported the preservation of the site as a park due to its old age and its high position, which would provide a good view over Secaucus. However, these proposals apparently failed.

It was the southernmost part of the pre-1965 Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey and corresponds roughly to the southernmost part of the present-day Kingston upon Thames postal district.Geographers' London Atlas (A-Z); various editions. It lies between Portsmouth Road, Kingston and Maple Road, Surbiton and includes Surbiton Crescent, Anglesea Road, Palace Road and Uxbridge Road. It is largely residential, but there are office buildings and a school on the eastern side. The Surbiton Park estate was established after the arrival of the railway in the mid 19th century. It occupies much of the grounds of a minor stately home, which survived until the 1930s. Surbiton Park was developed as a residential area in the middle of the 19th century after the opening of the London and Southampton Railway. However, by the first decade of the 21st century the name was fading from the public consciousness. It appeared to survive principally in the wording Surbiton Park Terrace on the 20th-century row of shops on the south-west side of Surbiton Road, just to the north of the original park. During that decade Surbiton Park sub-post office was closed and the bus stop formerly known as Surbiton Park Terrace was renamed Surbiton Road/Penrhyn Road. History =The original park= Detail of Ordnance Survey 25in. map 1865, showing Surbiton Park estate From the mid 18th century until the early 1930s a large house stood on the south-west side of what is now Surbiton Road, Kingston, close to the junction with what is now Maple Road, Surbiton.Sampson, p.16ff; Statham, p.16f. To the south and west of the main building there was an extensive park. The house was known at different times as Surbiton Place, Surbiton HouseFor this name, see later (Shrubsole period). and Surbiton Hall. It was built for William Roffee, a wealthy distiller, at the south-eastern end of Surbiton Street, now known as Surbiton Road, the principal thoroughfare of a hamlet of Kingston parish known as Surbiton (or Surbeton).Butters p.91(top) and map on front endpaper. When Roffee died in 1785, Surbiton Place was bought by Thomas Fassett, who extended both the house and the grounds.Sampson, p.16 In 1809 Fassett sold the house to Henry Paget, originally Bayly, who became Earl of Uxbridge. His son, also Henry Paget, inherited it in 1812. This Henry was the Earl of Uxbridge who distinguished himself at Waterloo. Not long after the battle, he became the first Marquess of Anglesey.Sampson, p.16ff. After his mother died in 1817, Anglesey sold the house to John Garratt, a prominent local politician, who later sold it to Alexander Raphael, a wealthy Roman Catholic.For 19th-century views of Surbiton Place, see Statham, p.19, McCormack, picture 39, Sampson p.viii. Raphael's gift to Kingston Raphael paid for the building of a Roman Catholic church on land in the north-western part of his estate. This is the Italianate church on Portsmouth Road known as St Raphael's. =Changing times= By the time Raphael died in 1850, major changes had begun to take place to the south of Kingston. The railway had reached the area in the late 1830s and the present-day town of Surbiton had started to grow up near the station. Raphael's heir, his nephew Edward Raphael, sold most of the estate for housing development. Just three acres of land remained with the house, which was occupied by the family of John Shrubsole, a banker and draper, until the death of his widow in 1914. Generally speaking, the house was known as Surbiton Hall during the Shrubsole period,Sampson, p.20. but there is evidence that it was also referred to as Surbiton House. Adjacent to a 20th-century residential block in Surbiton Road called Garrick House, there is a wall on which is a plaque bearing this inscription: The plaque in 2011. Photo: LynwoodF. THIS W(ALL I)S THE BOUNDARY OF, AND BELONGS TO SURBITON HOUSE MAY 19TH 1863. The name Surbiton House was used for the house on the Elmers estate before 1823, but this was on the other side of Terry's Lane, which ran roughly where Maple Road does today.Statham, pp.16&18. Both the date and location of the plaque suggest that it does not refer to that house. In the 1861 census return there is an entry for Surbiton House and Coach House, Surbiton Road.RG 9/456 fo.59. See Your Archives website. The coach house was across the road, where Surbiton High School junior school now stands.Statham, p.17. The 1865 edition of the Ordnance Survey 25in. map also describes the building as Surbiton House. Ten years later, in the 1871 census return, the house is described as Surbiton Hall.RG 10/861 fo.18. See above website. The coach house is not mentioned, neither does it appear on the 1865 O.S. map. =William Woods= Most of Raphael's estate was bought by William Woods, a speculative builder. He laid out the four principal streets of Surbiton Park in what had been the grounds of the house. He built large houses for the well- heeled, including some fine pairs of semi-detached houses, as well as some substantial mansions. The estate included a considerable amount of land south of the park, but not abutting to it. Woods built houses in several streets in this area, including Cadogan Road, which he named after Anglesey's second wife, Charlotte.Sampson, pp.18 & 20. The ancient oak behind The Grove in Maple Road, Surbiton. Beyond it are some of the Woods period houses in Grove Road. A little later he created Grove Road, which was extended eastwards to connect with Claremont Crescent (now The Crescent).Pink, Grove Road section. The stretch of the road east of Maple Lane (now Maple Road) was originally called Claremont Road.It became part of Grove Road after Railway Road was renamed Claremont Road. See wording in conveyance KX 89/3/3, also Sampson, p.10. A legal document dated 20 Feb 1860 describes Woods as \\"William Woods late of Swan Lane, Hampton Wick, Mddx., now of Surbiton Park South, Kingston, gent\\".Conveyance KX 89/3/1, concerning a property in \\"Maple Lane, Surbiton\\" (now Maple Road). This suggests that he had moved into one of his new houses, and the inclusion of the word South suggests that he made a distinction between the park proper and the more southerly development. However, there is evidence that Woods lived in Palace Road, in the park proper.Letter of 16/3/89 from Kingston Director of Development concerning Cadogan Road Conservation Area. Perhaps he moved within the area or maybe the punctuation of the quoted document is incorrect; \\"Surbiton Park, South Kingston\\" would make perfect sense. Woods played a part in the creation of Queen's Promenade, which runs along the Thames on the other side of Portsmouth Road from Surbiton Park.Sampson, p.124ff. =Surbiton Park Terrace= This shopping parade was built in 1851 on the north-east side of Surbiton Road to serve the new residential area. A wide variety of traders occupied the shops.Sampson O&N;, p.42. For example, Samuel Fry set up a photographic studio at 9, Surbiton Park Terrace in 1865. The words Surbiton Park Terrace are visible on the façade of the 20th century parade of shops built opposite the original Terrace. The original Surbiton Park Terrace =Surbiton Park Congregational Church= This striking neo-Gothic building was completed in 1866 and stood on the south-west corner of the junction between Grove Road and Maple Road for more than a century.Statham, pp.43 & 44, McCormack, picture 41. Its site is now occupied by a row of houses. Since the demolition of this church there has been no tangible connection between the southern part of the Woods development and the name Surbiton Park. =The later 19th century= In 1855 the new town of Surbiton was placed in the hands of Improvement Commissioners and this ensured that it was independent of Kingston.Statham, p.36. The Commissioners were replaced by an Urban District Council in 1894.Statham, p.64ff. The boundary between Kingston and Surbiton ran down the middle of Maple Road to a point a little south of Uxbridge Road, and then turned abruptly west and ran behind the houses on the south side of Uxbridge Road towards the Thames. Thus a large part of the original Surbiton, including the big house and its park, remained inside Kingston and was not subject to the Commissioners.Statham, p.51 (map). A wall between Maple House and Home Court, both in Maple Road, runs along the line of this former boundary. In 1884 Surbiton High School was founded by Anglican clergymen and it is still in existence. =The 20th century= The first tram to cross Kingston Bridge - 1 March 1906. (Public domain.) These trams with roofs were not typical of the trams used on routes through Kingston. Most pictures show open-topped vehicles. LCC open-topped tramcar by David Ingham. London United used similar vehicles on the route through Surbiton Park.Sampson O&N;, p.47. See also p.50 for fuller story. In 1906 Surbiton Park became a great deal noisier with the coming of the tramway. The route between Kingston and Surbiton town centre passed along Surbiton Crescent, although this necessitated the demolition of a shop at the junction with Surbiton Road.Statham, p.83. Mrs Shrubsole died in 1914 after four decades of widowhood. The next occupant of Surbiton Hall was also its last, Sir Sidney Pocock. He had an adventurous life and there is a biography of him, including a history of the house, on the UK Genealogy Archives website. Sir Sidney died in 1931 and soon afterwards Surbiton Hall was demolished. Semi- detached houses were built in Surbiton Road, Maple Road, Surbiton Crescent and a new cul-de-sac called Surbiton Hall Close. During the Second World War a V-1 flying bomb, or doodlebug, destroyed houses on Portsmouth Road between Palace Road and Uxbridge Road.Statham, pp.69 & 113. This led to the creation of a new road called Home Park Walk. London trolleybus by Dan Sellers. In the middle of the 20th century vehicles like this ran along Surbiton Crescent.See \\"E\\" Plates website. Retrieved 17/6/11. The post-war period has not been kind to Surbiton Park. Many of the Woods mansions and houses have been demolished and replaced piecemeal with blocks of flats and houses of various designs. Only in Uxbridge Road does there remain a substantial group of Victorian houses. In 1965 the Greater London area was created and Surbiton, which had been granted a Borough Charter in 1936,Statham, p.104. was incorporated into the new Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.Statham, p.126. The old borough boundary remained for some time as constituency and ward boundaries, but these have now been moved. During the last two decades of the 20th century attitudes changed towards buildings of historical interest. Steps were taken to protect the architectural heritage of the area and Cadogan Road and Claremont Road Conservation Areas both include parts of Surbiton Park.See Kingston Council website.

Streets =Surbiton Crescent= Surbiton High School. Photo: Motmit. This gently curving road is the principal thoroughfare of the area. The main bus route between Kingston and Surbiton town centres passes along it, as did the tram and then trolleybus routes in earlier times. Just one Victorian mansion survives, at the northern end of the western side. The greater part of the eastern side is taken up by Surbiton High School, a well respected independent Church of England school, mainly for girls. An office building called Sutherland House stands on the northern side of the junction with Maple Road, Surbiton. It replaces a Victorian mansion of the same name which served as a school for a while in the 19th century.McCormack, picture 41. It is understood that Thomas Anstey Guthrie, the writer F. Anstey, attended this school and used it as a model for the school in his 1882 novel Vice Versa.David C. Taylor: People of Cobham. The Pyports Connection. (Barracuda, Buckingham, 1985.) Samuel Bradnack, the original of Grimstone, later opened a school in Folkestone also called Sutherland House. One mansion survives on Maple Road, just to the north of Sutherland House. It is now used as offices. =Anglesea Road= Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge and 1st Marquess of Anglesey. Houses in Anglesea Road The eccentric spelling of this road's name remains as a historical curiosity, but it is clear that it was named in honour of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, the most illustrious owner of Surbiton Place.Sampson, p.17f. He played a significant rôle in the Battle of Waterloo and was awarded his marquessate shortly afterwards. Towards the end of the battle he lost a leg, but survived this injury and lived on into his middle 80s. However, he did not live in the house to any great extent after he inherited it, selling it when his mother died. An aerial photograph said to have been taken in June, 1920Published by Airpic, Redbourn. shows a good number of Woods period houses on the north side of Anglesea Road. Of these nos. 1 and 2, which are a pair of semi-detached houses, and no. 12, which is attached to 28, Portsmouth Road (Anglesea Lodge), have survived. Between St Raphael's Church and Anglesea Road there is a development of between-the-wars houses called Riverside Close. In the aerial picture this area appears to be a field, so it is clear that it never formed part of the Woods estate. Surviving houses at the corner of Portsmouth and Anglesea Roads =Palace Road= Hampton Court Palace - East Front by Steve Cadman. The last of eleven houses built in Palace Road by William Woods This was the most prestigious of all the roads in the Woods development. It is very wide - there would be room to turn a horse-drawn carriage - and the aerial picture shows eleven mansions of similar design, well spaced and with large gardens. The road affords a view of the East Front of Hampton Court Palace and is directly in line with the Long Water. Of the mansions, only one remains, no. 11, at the Surbiton Crescent end. It is now divided into flats. Westergate House, on Portsmouth Road at the corner of Palace Road, survived until the late 20th century, but has now been replaced by a block of flats. In the middle of the north side of the road a long-established motor repair business continues unobtrusively. =Uxbridge Road= Houses on the south side of Uxbridge Road The four Woods period houses on the north side of Uxbridge Road Most roads with this name in and around western Greater London lead to the ancient market town of Uxbridge in Middlesex, but this one is named after the two Earls of Uxbridge who owned Surbiton Place. Some of the Victorian buildings have been replaced, mainly with blocks of flats, but so many remain that the whole of the south side of the road and part of the north side are included in Cadogan Road Conservation Area.See map on p.5 of leaflet on Kingston Council website. Retrieved 26/10/10. Near the Portsmouth Road end of the south side there is an orthodox synagogue.To see the synagogue's website, click here. There was formerly a car showroom almost directly opposite, but this has been replaced by houses. =Surbiton Hall Close= This is a cul-de-sac of 1930s semi- detached houses built on land which had remained with Surbiton Hall after most of the park was sold to William Woods. =Home Park Walk= Flats in Home Park Walk During the Second World War a V-1 flying bomb destroyed houses in Portsmouth Road between the junctions with Palace Road and Uxbridge Road. After the war this new road was created and named after Hampton Court Home Park, which is just across the river. For decades there was a low-rise petrol station, designed to be unobtrusive, between the west side and Portsmouth Road. This was derelict for some years, but the space is now used by a hand car wash business. The whole of the east side is taken up by a terrace of flats built in a dignified style which, while different from that of the Victorian buildings, makes a positive contribution to the overall appearance of the area. =Haylett Gardens= This is a post-war development of mixed housing on land bounded by Anglesea Road, Surbiton Crescent and Palace Road.This is not strictly a street, but it is a substantial development and is shown in the A-Z Street Atlas. =Belgravia Mews= This double cul-de-sac is part of a dense development of 1960s-style town houses between Palace Road and Uxbridge Road, a classic example of post-war infill.The name is assumed to be a fanciful invention. =Raphael Close= Named after Alexander Raphael, who lived in Surbiton Place before the Woods estate was built, this is a small, secluded development of houses in the late 20th/early 21st century style. Another view of St Raphael's Church. This is the south side as seen from Portsmouth Road Oral traditions In the 1960s there were people living in Surbiton Park who had memories of the area as it was in the late 19th century. Stories were told about various events in the history of the area. The purpose of this section is to assess the probability of the truth of some of these traditions. =The S-shaped strip= There had been a plan to build a new road south of Uxbridge Road, but this scheme was abandoned when Catherine Road, Surbiton was built, and the land was sold off in small plots. :This is essentially true, but the timing of the various elements of the story needs to be understood. :On maps of several different periods it is possible to see a strip of land with a gentle reverse curve, running roughly west to east immediately south of Surbiton Park.See e.g. Pink, Grove Road section, first three maps. :In his original plan for his Surbiton development, Thomas Pooley showed a road on this strip which would give access to the Portsmouth Road.Statham, p.25 (map). The strip is shown separately at the top. The junction would not have been directly opposite the end of the present Claremont Road, because the park of Surbiton Place was in the way and the strip was the nearest available land. :Pooley got into financial difficulties and his scheme was never completed.Statham, p.26ff. Once William Woods had built Uxbridge Road, there was a more direct route to the main road and the river. The building of Catherine Road finally put paid to the idea of a road on the strip. :Therefore, the strip was sold off in relatively small plots. The predecessor of the present RavensideThis name appears in the 1905 Kelly's Directory. was built on Portsmouth Road, and the fancifully named EastfieldThe area was historically known as West Field. See Pink, Westfield Road section. was built in Maple Road on the site now occupied by Home Court. :The remainder of the land was sold to the owners of houses in Uxbridge Road to lengthen their gardens. The land was in Surbiton and it was part of the folklore that an additional amount of rates was paid to Kingston and passed on to Surbiton, until the amalgamation of 1965 brought an end to this anomaly. :The strip can still be discerned on the Ordnance Survey 1:1,250 map (the \\"50in. map\\"). =The tram route= Kingston Market Place with memorial to Henry Shrubsole. Photo: Colin Smith. The tramway was routed via Surbiton Crescent as a result of pressure from the occupant of Surbiton Hall. :This could very well be true. Mrs Shrubsole was a member of a prominent family in Kingston, one of whom, Henry, served as mayor three times.Butters, p.132. No doubt she had the ear of councillors. :Examination of the 50in. map shows that the tramway company would have preferred to take the route via the gentler turn into Maple Road and the very gentle turn into Claremont Road. :However, Mrs Shrubsole would not have wanted to have clanking, screeching trams passing in front of her home every few minutes. =Alignment of houses= The 1930s houses in Surbiton Road were built at an angle to the road in order to reflect the orientation of Surbiton Hall. :If this was ever a stated aim, it was a case of making a virtue out of necessity. :The 50in. map shows that the boundaries of the curtilages are parallel to the existing wall at the northern end of the site, the one with the plaque mentioned in the History section above. Since the houses are semi-detached, it is a practical necessity for the side walls to be parallel to the curtilage boundaries. :In addition, the arrangement allows the house at the corner, 157, Maple Road, to have a reasonably sized rear garden.

He served as a counselor in the bishopric in Kirtland, Ohio, from 1835 to 1838, then as bishop in Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County, Missouri, from 1838 to 1839, and finally as bishop of the Lower Ward in Nauvoo, Illinois, having been called by Joseph Smith through revelation to that office in January 1841. Knight served as bishop in Nauvoo until his sudden death at age 38. Early years Knight was born March 14, 1804, in Norwich, Hampshire County, Massachusetts, to Doctor Rodolphus KnightBelnap Family Organization: Histories and Documents: Rodolphus Knight (1768–1809) and Rizpah LeeBelnap Family Organization: Histories and Documents: Rizpah Lee (1774–1853) (daughter of American Revolutionary War Captain Sherebiah Lee). Following his father's death when he was five years old, his mother moved the family to upstate New York. Here Knight married Martha McBride, daughter of itinerant pre-Campbellite minister Daniel McBrideBelnap Family Organization: Histories and Documents: Daniel McBride (1766–1823) and Abigail Mead,Belnap Family Organization: Histories and Documents: Abigail Mead (1770–1854) on July 26, 1826. They initially resided near Martha's relatives in Perrysburg, New York, where their first four children (Almira Knight, born 1827; Rizpah Knight, born 1829; Adaline Knight, born 1831; James Vinson Knight, born 1833) were born. Here Knight acquired considerable wealth from his farm produce. Starting in 1833, members of the McBride family began converting to the Latter Day Saint church. Vinson and Martha were baptized into the church soon thereafter, on March 24, 1834, after having been taught in their home by church founder Joseph Smith. Kirtland and Missouri period In June 1835, Knight moved his family to Kirtland, Ohio, to gather with other Latter Day Saints. They resided in a fine home on the corner of Cowdery and Joseph Streets near the Kirtland Temple. (This home is still standing.) Knight was called as a counselor in the Kirtland bishopric. Vinson and Martha received their patriarchal blessings on June 24, 1835, at the hands of Joseph Smith Sr. Martha gave birth to one son in Kirtland, Nathaniel Knight, in 1835 (for whom the name was selected by Joseph Smith Sr.); he died on October 31, 1836. On January 2, 1837, Vinson and Martha signed the new Articles of Agreement of the Kirtland Safety Society. In September 1837, Knight left for Missouri with Joseph Smith and was away for two months. Deep apostasy and persecution took hold in Kirtland during that period. The Knight family moved with other faithful Latter Day Saints in the spring of 1838 to Missouri, arriving at the end of May 1838 at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri. They settled in Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County, where Knight was appointed bishop on June 28, 1838. Very quickly persecution again descended upon the Knight family and others. Within a very brief period, Knight and his family, suffering greatly, were driven from their home by a mob. Knight later executed an affidavit in October 1839 itemizing a bill of damages against the State of Missouri for $10,000 in compensation for property lost and expenses incurred during the expulsion—one of the largest claims made by a Latter Day Saint family for damages suffered in Missouri. Forced to flee Missouri following Governor Bogg's Extermination Order, Knight and his family found refuge with some friends in Pike County, near the Mississippi River, where Martha gave birth to Martha Abigail Knight on February 9, 1839. Nauvoo period In April 1839, Knight traveled to Iowa to purchase land on which the Latter Day Saints could settle. He and his family moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), Hancock County, Illinois. Here, on land that Knight helped select, he constructed a sturdy two-story red brick home on Main Street, said to be the first brick house in Nauvoo, on the same block as the homes of apostles Brigham Young and John Taylor. (This home is still standing.) In Nauvoo, Knight was actively involved in community and religious affairs. Soon after arriving in Nauvoo, Knight was designated aide-de-camp to Joseph Smith in the Nauvoo Legion. In January 1841, Knight was called as bishop of the Lower Ward in Nauvoo. He also served as a member of the first Nauvoo city council and as Regent of the University of the City of Nauvoo. During the April 1841 general conference, apostle Ezra T. Benson stayed with the Knight family. The story is told that Vinson's wife, Martha, knew something was worrying her husband and he could not seem to tell her about it. One evening, as Martha was sitting in the grape arbor behind the house, Vinson returned home carrying a basket. He explained to Martha that he had taken some fruit and vegetables to Philindia Clark Eldredge Merrick (Myrick), widow of Levi N. Merrick, whose husband had been killed in the Haun's Mill Massacre. Vinson explained to Martha that he had been told to enter plural marriage and that, if he had to, this Sister Merrick would be the one he could help best. Martha's reply is said to have been, \\"Is that all?\\" Because the conversation at the grape arbor apparently occurred in the fall of 1841, it is possible Vinson's initial activities related to plural marriage were not authorized by Joseph Smith. As Helen Mar Kimball would relate, \\"Before my father [Heber C. Kimball] ever heard that such a principle had been revealed to Joseph Smith he said to some friends in my hearing that if 'all things were to be restored again as they were in the beginning,' as the scriptures declare them, the principle of a plurality of wives must also be restored\\".Jeni Broberg Holzapfel and Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, eds., A Woman’s View: Helen Mar Whitney's Reminiscences of Early Church History (Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1997), 109–34, Chapter 4: Scenes in Nauvoo, online 2 Mar 2017 at https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/womans-view-helen-mar-whitneys-reminiscences- earlychurch-history/4-scenes-nauvoo. However it appears that by the spring of 1842, Vinson Knight had repented of any unauthorized plural marriage activity he may have been engaged in. This is seen in the minutes of the Women's Relief Society of Nauvoo, of which Knight's wife, Martha, was a founding member. The organization meeting was held on March 17, 1842, in Nauvoo, which also happened to be Martha's 37th birthday. The founding purpose of Relief Society was \\"not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls.\\" Minutes of the Relief Society, 9 June 1842, available online 9 May 2017 at http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/nauvoo-relief-society-minute- book/60 Martha Knight was possibly present on March 31, 1842, when Emma Smith read a letter warning the women of Relief Society about seducers. The letter was signed by Vinson Knight along with Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, and Heber C. Kimball. An excerpt reads: \\"...such men... say they have authority from Joseph, or the First Presidency, or any other Presidency of the Church; and thus, with a lie in their mouth, deceive and debauch the innocent, under the assumption that they are authoriz'd from these sources? May God Forbid! \\"there are those, and we therefore warn you, & forewarn you, in the name of the Lord, to check & destroy any faith that any innocent person may have in any such character; for we do not want any one to believe any thing as coming from us... you are authoriz'd on the very first intimation of the kind, to denounce them as such, & shun them as the flying fiery serpent, whether they are prophets, Seers, or revelators; Patriarchs, twelve Apostles, Elders, Priests, Mayers, Generals, City Councillors, Aldermen, Marshalls, Police, Lord Mayors or the Devil, are alike culpable & shall be damned for such evil practices...\\"Letter of 31 March 1842 from Joseph Smith et al. to the Relief Society, available online 9 May 2017 at http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/nauvoo-relief-society-minute- book/83 Death and legacy Just when he was increasingly involved in the affairs of Nauvoo, Knight suddenly took ill and died on July 31, 1842, in Nauvoo. Joseph Smith preached at the funeral, stating that Knight was the \\"best friend he ever had on earth.\\"Lisa Wood, Biography For: Martha McBride Knight Smith Kimball, online 26 Mar 2014 at http://www.mypioneertrek.com/Biographies.aspx?PioneerName=Martha%20McBride%20 Knight%20Smith%20Kimball. One month later, on September 3, 1842, Martha lost her and Vinson's youngest child, Rodolphus Elderkin Knight, who was less than one year old. After Vinson's untimely death in July 1842, Martha would enter into covenant with Joseph Smith. In 1843, William Clayton documented a conversation he had with Joseph Smith discussing \\"delicate matters.\\" The 23 June journal entry reads in part: \\"Also Brother Knight he [Joseph Smith] gave him one but he [Knight] went to loose conduct and he [Joseph Smith] could not save him.\\"William Clayton Journal entry of June 23, 1843. See An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton, George D. Smith editor, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, UT, 1995, p. 108. As one other men mentioned in the 23 June journal entry had died and another had suffered a heart attack, the reference to saving may refer to the fact that Vinson died despite likely attempts to prolong his life via faith healing, rather than asserting that Vinson was damned for the \\"loose conduct.\\" When it became possible to solemnize eternal marriages with deceased spouses in the Nauvoo temple in 1845-1846, Martha chose to be eternally united or sealed to Joseph Smith rather than Vinson. Heber C. Kimball acted as Joseph's proxy in the ceremony, and thus became Martha's husband \\"for time\\". The woman traditionally considered to have become Knight's plural wife in 1841, Philindia Clark Eldredge Merrick (Myrick), also declined to unite herself with Vinson in eternity. Notable descendants of Knight include Francis M. Gibbons and Larry W. Gibbons, both of whom became general authorities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Possible first Presiding Bishop According to an analysis by D. Michael Quinn, Knight could be considered the first Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church. Edward Partridge, the first man called to be a Mormon bishop, died in 1840. This was before Vinson Knight was called \\"to preside over the bishopric\\" (See D&C; 124:141). Though the office of Presiding Bishop arguably didn't exist until 1847, Edward Partridge, rather than Vinson Knight, is recognized by the LDS Church as the first Presiding Bishop.

It was a secretive, secure, and self-contained naval base, engaged in a number of communications and intelligence gathering functions for the Navy and other federal intelligence organizations. The site was purchased by the Navy in 1941, and closed in 1993. The antennas continued to be used for some time after that, but by 2013 they were removed along with all of the remaining buildings. Skaggs Island San Pablo Bay and the Carquinez Strait Skaggs Island was once a thriving tidal marsh next to San Pablo Bay.

The station, which opened as part of a new motor train service between and , was opened to serve a Victorian hall situated to the west. The station, one of the smallest to be taken over by British Railways on nationalisation in 1947, never really justified its existence and closed in 1952 following a period of temporary closure during the Second World War. The line through Grainsby remained open for freight until December 1980. History The station was opened on 11 December 1905 to coincide with the introduction of a motor train service by the Great Northern Railway. It consisted of two low facing halt platforms to the south of the level crossing over Grainsby Lane; a small single-storey timber waiting shelter was provided on the up platform. It was not provided with any lighting, which made it very difficult to find on a dark night. A crossing keeper's cottage lay to the north of the crossing. The cottage was similar in design to the cottage at . The station was opened to serve Grainsby Hall, a Victorian country house situated to the west. The house was occupied by the Haigh family, Halifax wool merchants who had inherited the estate in 1829. Once the home of George Henry Caton Haigh, the house stood empty for many years and was reputed to be haunted. It was demolished in 1972. The station, at which trains only called upon request, closed as a temporary wartime measure in 1939. It still figured in timetables for October 1939, 1940 and 1941, but no trains were scheduled to call. The halt reopened after the war on an unknown date, when it was one of the smallest stations to be inherited by British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948. Grainsby Halt never really justified its existence and was closed permanently on 10 March 1952. Present day Station site in 2008. Although the halt remained in a good condition almost ten years after closure, it was subsequently demolished by British Rail before final closure of the line in December 1980. Nothing remains of the halt, although the crossing keeper's cottage was still standing, in a derelict state, in 2006. On 28 September 1991, the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway obtained a Light Railway Order authorising the reinstatement of the East Lincolnshire Railway between and the former Keddington Road level crossing near Louth, which would include the section of line through Utterby. On 26 August 2009, the first train between - the first station to the south from Grainsby - and ran for the first time in 47 years. It is planned to reopen the line still further through Grainsby as far as Holton-Le-Clay. Future The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway aims to eventually (when time and money permit) extend the line, northwards from North Thoresby, through to as far as Holton-le-Clay. It is however very doubtful that Grainsby halt will ever be reinstated, as the LWR would concentrate on track extension to Holton- le-Clay, however, Grainsby would start of as the temporary limit of the line, before track extension would continue. The adjacent Level crossing will almost certainly be an Automatic half barrier crossing instead of crossing gates that will be locally monitored by North Thoresby signal box. The former crossing keeper's house that is standing in its original position to the north of the level crossing is in a dangerous condition and will almost certainly be demolished.

It failed to garner the millions of TV viewers witnessed in Sweden, and was cancelled. In autumn 1996, an attempt was made to restart the show with a more famous host, but the attempt stranded since two consecutive governments each refused to grant a lottery concession. Concept First incarnation BingoLotto was imported to Norway in 1993 by the newly founded (1992) television channel TV 2. Former ice hockey referee Tore Holden was selected as host. He had no prior television experience, but was found to have a popular appeal. The game itself was administered by a company named BingoLotto Norge. In April 1994, after a year with BingoLotto, the ratings had plummeted to 200,000 viewers and 35,000 lottery ticket buyers. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People, which had cooperated with TV 2, saw little of its promised share of the lottery income. BingoLotto Norge as well as the Swedish people behind BingoLotto criticized Holden's performance. The show was stopped altogether in mid-1994. Second incarnation In late 1996 an attempt was made to kickstart the show again, this time with the Norwegian Confederation of Sports as beneficiary organization. Hallvard Flatland first said no to become host, then yes the next month. However, the people behind BingoLotto struggled to find a channel to air the program, and to get the relevant concession from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. In August 1997 the concession application was declined. Turid Birkeland of Jagland's Cabinet was responsible, and the case thus became a part of the election campaigning for the Norwegian parliamentary election of 1997. Hallvard Flatland, who had lost his prospect of a job worth (in wages), took part in the campaigning. As the election resulted in a cabinet change, the new Bondevik's First Cabinet promised to consider the application anew. The Confederation of Sports, however, backed out. An opposition party, the Conservative Party, brought the case to the Parliament of Norway, but the Standing Committee on Justice declined to support the application. When the case went on to the Parliament in session in December 1997, it was again rejected, against the votes of the Conservative and Progress Party. The majority voted to send the case back to the government. The government issued its final verdict in May 1998, again rejecting a concession.

Sixteen-year-old Suzanne Jane Capper died in Withington Hospital on 18 December 1992, from multiple organ failure arising from 80% burns after she was deliberately set on fire on 14 December. Before her death, Capper related that she had previously been kidnapped and kept prisoner for seven days at a house in Moston, Manchester, where she was beaten and tortured. She was taken from the house by car, driven into the countryside and forced out of the car virtually naked into a wood at Werneth Low where petrol was poured over her and she was set alight. The torture and murder arose from the \\"avenging [of] trivial grievances: a sexual insult, infection with pubic lice and the loss of a pink duffel coat.\\" Detectives conducting the inquiry said that \\"for sheer mindless brutality\\" the crime ranked alongside the torture inflicted on children by the Moors murderers. The case went to trial in November 1993, but received \\"comparatively little publicity\\" as it coincided with the trial of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables for the murder of James Bulger. On 17 December 1993, Jean Powell, aged 26, her ex-husband Glyn Powell, aged 29, and Bernadette McNeilly, aged 24, were sentenced to life imprisonment for their parts in the murder. Jeffrey Leigh, aged 27, was jailed for twelve years for false imprisonment. Jean Powell's brother Clifford Pook, aged 18, was sentenced to fifteen years in a Young Offenders' Institution for false imprisonment and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Anthony Michael Dudson, who was 16 years old at the time of the murder, was also found guilty of murder and sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure under section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Background Capper, described as \\"a gentle and easily influenced girl,\\" had been babysitting for Jean Powell since she was ten years old. In 1990 she had spent time in the care of the local authority after her mother, Elizabeth Capper, and her stepfather separated, after which Suzanne and her older sister Michelle stayed with their stepfather. Around this time Capper began to truant from Moston Brook High School, and her attendance during the final two years of schooling was described as \\"erratic.\\" Capper increasingly spent her time at Powell's house. Powell lived at 97 Langworthy Road, Moston, a small Victorian terraced house, where she also dealt drugs and was involved with the handling of stolen motor vehicles. Michelle Capper had briefly lived with Powell, but moved out in August 1992 because she did not like the \\"evil new friends\\" Powell was associating with, particularly Bernadette McNeilly, who had recently moved in three doors away at number 91. McNeilly, who had three children, subsequently moved in with Powell and her three children, where the two shared a bed in the downstairs dining room because the bedrooms were \\"full of children.\\" Capper continued to stay regularly even though Powell and McNeilly frequently bullied her. Her sister said: \\"It was not that she was scared of them, it's just that she would do anything for them. She pampered their every whim.\\" Powell was separated from her husband Glyn, although the two remained friendly and he would visit regularly from his nearby home. McNeilly's boyfriend was 16-year-old Anthony Dudson, who was also having sexual intercourse with Powell. Powell was sexually involved with Jeffrey Leigh, a regular visitor to the house as a purchaser of amphetamines. Another frequent visitor to the house was Powell's younger brother, Clifford Pook. Events leading to murder =Kidnap= At trial, it emerged that Capper had been kidnapped for \\"insubstantial, even trivial\\" reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper had tried to persuade her to sleep with a man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had contracted pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink duffel coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she thought that he had caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: \\"I told Jean [Powell] I thought I got them from Bernie [McNeilly].\\" On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair and place it in a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked around her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly as she lay curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken to the bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as \\"ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved.\\" Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room. =Torture= Over the next five days Capper was subjected to a series of violent acts, \\"increasing in severity and brutality as the time passed.\\" She was regularly beaten and injected with amphetamines, burned with cigarettes, and had rave music—in particular Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?) by 150 Volts, featuring samples from the movie Child's Play—played at maximum volume through headphones. McNeilly would commence each torture session with the phrase \\"Chucky’s coming to play\\" and soon the words themselves were enough to make Capper scream. At some point during the week Pook and Leigh called at the house and were shown Capper, blindfolded and gagged, tied to the bed. By this time, Capper had been lying in her own urine and feces for several days and was placed in a bath containing concentrated disinfectant and scrubbed with a stiff brush with sufficient force to remove skin. Pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth, which police later found at his house \\"like some kind of macabre trophy.\\" Dudson said: \\"I was stood at the doorway with Jeanie [Powell] and Bernie [McNeilly]. Cliff [Pook] took her gag off. He told her to open her mouth. He said: 'Right, I'm going to rip your teeth out'. He started hitting her teeth with the pliers. He got the pliers on and started pulling it out. But it just snapped and chipped. Then he hit them a few more times. He put the pliers on again and really, really pulled. He pulled Suzanne's head forward until there was a snap and he had the tooth in the pliers. He did the same again and he was laughing.\\" =Missed opportunities for rescue= David Hill, 18, was asked to \\"sit in\\" at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout \\"Shut up, you slag!\\" in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: \\"She had a sort of cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and covering her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair.\\" Hill also said he had heard them talking about \\"dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers.\\" Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: \\"She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything.\\" He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: \\"I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [anything] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything.\\" While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiancé Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: \\"They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room.\\" Murder A Fiat Panda similar to the one used by Capper's murderers to convey her from Moston to Werneth Low. The six finally agreed that Capper had to be removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her stepfather was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly \\"giggled\\" as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: \\"Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [McNeilly] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her.\\" When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: \\"In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went straight up in flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest.\\" McNeilly began to sing \\"Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!\\" from The Trammps song Disco Inferno. Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: \\"Cliff [Pook] asked Glyn [Powell], 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back.\\" =Naming attackers before death= Werneth Low, where Capper suffered burns that led to her death. Capper had not died immediately as her murderers believed, and after they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately a quarter of a mile (400 metres) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: \\"Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me.\\" They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: \\"Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance.\\" Margaret Coop said: \\"I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs.\\" Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: \\"She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live.\\" Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness. =Arrests= The inquiry was led by Detective Inspector Peter Wall of Greater Manchester Police. At 07:30 on 14 December, he instructed officers to attend 97 Langworthy Road and arrest everyone that they found there. Jean Powell and McNeilly laughed and joked with each other as they were arrested. Initially, all six denied involvement. Under questioning, Dudson, who had been urged by his father to tell the truth, began to talk. D.I. Wall said of Dudson's statement: \\"As the story began to unfold, we just couldn't believe it. I kept asking myself how one human being could do this to another.\\" Police officers \\"wept as the extent of Suzanne's suffering was revealed,\\" and together with civilian staff at the station the police collected cash to send flowers to her at the hospital. On 17 December 1992, the six accused appeared before magistrates in Manchester and were remanded into custody charged with kidnapping and attempted murder. Following Capper's death they were charged with her murder on 23 December 1992. =Inquest= The inquest was opened by Leonard Gorodkin at Manchester Coroner's Court on 8 January 1993. Dr William Lawler, a Home Office pathologist, testified that Capper had suffered 75–80 per cent burns consistent with having had petrol thrown over her and set alight, and that her chance of survival had been minimal. \\"It was clear from the outset that Suzanne was unlikely to survive. She suffered widespread burns that led to several complications internally.\\" Death was due to complications caused by these burns. The coroner said: \\"It is clear that this young girl must have suffered a great deal of pain and had no chance of survival. But she did fortunately survive long enough to give information which led to the people mentioned being charged with her death.\\" To Capper's mother and stepfather the coroner said: \\"I offer you, not just on my behalf but on behalf of the whole nation, my very deepest sympathy and condolences at this tragic happening to your young daughter.\\" Convictions The trial commenced on 16 November 1993, and lasted 22 days. All six denied murder and in their testimonies each defendant tried to minimise his or her part in the crime. On 24 November, Clifford Pook was cleared of murder on the directions of the judge Mr. Justice Potts. The jury began their deliberations on 16 December 1993, and took nine hours and fifty-two minutes to reach their verdicts. Mr Justice Potts said: \\"Each of you has been convicted on clear evidence of murder which was as appalling a murder as it is possible to imagine.\\" =Verdicts and sentences= ;Bernadette McNeilly *guilty of murder – life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 25 years *guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm – 20 years *pleaded guilty to false imprisonment – 20 years ;Jean Powell *guilty of murder – life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 25 years *guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm – 20 years *pleaded guilty to false imprisonment – 20 years ;Glyn Powell *guilty of murder – life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 25 years *guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm – 20 years *guilty of false imprisonment – 20 years ;Jeffrey Leigh *pleaded guilty to false imprisonment – 12 years *acquitted of murder *acquitted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm ;Anthony Michael Dudson *guilty of murder – detained indefinitely with a minimum tariff of 18 years *guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm – 15 years *pleaded guilty to false imprisonment – 15 years ;Clifford Pook *pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm – 15 years *pleaded guilty to false imprisonment – 15 years *acquitted of murder As the sentences were announced two jurors wept and there were cries of \\"Yes! Yes!\\" from the public gallery, which was filled with relatives of the victim. In a statement to the press after the sentencing D.I. Wall said: \\"Psychological Reports say that these are absolutely sane individuals. It's frightening that they are such ordinary people. There is nothing special about any of them.\\" =Appeals= Leigh appealed against his sentence, which was reduced from 12 years to 9 years on 4 November 1994. In 2002, Dudson's minimum tariff was cut from 18 years to 16 years. Dudson appealed again, arguing that the reduction was insufficient and that the Lord Chief Justice \\"had failed to reflect the continuing obligation to have regard to Dudson's welfare.\\" Lord Justice Kennedy and Mr Justice Mackay dismissed this second appeal on 21 November 2003. He was moved to an open prison in 2009. Jean Powell and McNeilly were granted leave to have the lengths of their minimum sentences reviewed at the Court of Appeal in June 2012. McNeilly's sentence was reduced by one year. =McNeilly prison controversy= While she was incarcerated at HM Prison Durham, a routine security check in 1996 uncovered letters which revealed McNeilly had been having an affair with the prison governor, Mike Martin. The married officer resigned his position before disciplinary action could be taken. McNeilly, who was sharing a wing with Rosemary West and Myra Hindley, was immediately transferred to HM Prison New Hall. =Releases from prison= Leigh was freed early from his sentence in 1998, as was Pook in May 2001. Both were released on licence. McNeilly was released from prison in December 2014.http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/418304/CHUCKY-killer-is-back- on-the-streets-with-secret-new-identity Reactions =Social environment= There was wide commentary in the news media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while \\"superficially, it is a city of growth\\"—hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games—this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of \\"built-to-collapse\\" housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where \\"you can expect to be mugged,\\" created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who \\"don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark.\\" Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where \\"expensive canal- side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past.\\" David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: \\"These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them—just shagging and having kids.\\" The Daily Mail—in what Barker and Petley called \\"ideological overdrive\\"—described Capper's killers as \\"the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security ... [and belong to] an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future.\\" Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only \\"look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft.\\" =\\"Moral panic\\"= Davis also noted the unusual situation in that \\"a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders.\\" Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about \\"girl gangs\\" and the rise in violent crime committed by young women, and \\"the probation service and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture on the streets of Britain.\\" Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London Probation Service Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: \\"One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it.\\" However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show \\"an increase in the number of women jailed for offences involving violence.\\" The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is \\"characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration.\\" In one of the \\"starkest signs of change\\" there was evidence that \\"in the 15–17 age group, girls are more likely to take pleasure in violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up.\\" Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, in cases like this which involved female and male sadists, \\"the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffel coat was an excuse to torture someone to death.\\" =\\"Video nasties\\"= The moral panic was not confined solely to the gender of the murderers, but also the role played by so-called \\"video nasties\\". The news media immediately made a connection between the Bulger murder trial and the Capper murder trial when the horror movie Child's Play 3: Look Who's Stalking was mentioned as part of the testimonies. D.I. Wall said \\"throughout interviews with the accused there was no suggestion that the reason Suzanne was killed had anything to do with \\"Child's Play\\" but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines (Demonic doll Chucky links the horror crimes; The curse of Chucky). Neither Powell or McNeilly owned a video recorder, and the Child's Play-inspired music that had been used to torture Capper was a popular track at the time, taped direct from Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. Broadcaster David Elstein called the video connection \\"a false story... branded into the consciousness of the media,\\" and questioned the news media's fascination with the film: \\"There is no reason to believe that Suzanne Capper would be alive today if the audiotape had instead contained the torture scene from King Lear, or a catchphrase from Bruce Forsyth ... But the Child's Play hare has been running ever since the last day of the James Bulger murder trial.\\" Elstein argued that the film was simply a scapegoat which the press \\"made a three-course meal out of.\\" The Guardian reported that 21,000 four- to nine-year-olds watched each of BSkyB's two transmissions of Child's Play 3—but Elstein explained the figure was \\"simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from BARB's reporting panel, and that the margin of error means even the two may have been just one. But why spoil a good running story by asking what the figures mean?\\" In April 1994, Professor Elizabeth Newson published Video Violence and the Protection of Children (the \\"Newson Report\\") which attracted huge media interest due to its claims that it had \\"definitively established the long sought-for link between screen violence and the real-life variety,\\" and which cited the Capper murder as an example. Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, \\"merely drawing inferences from ... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research.\\" Newson was called to give oral evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on Video Violence, where she asserted: \\"The Suzanne Capper case is another example of very explicit imitation of video and the use of video and that was Child's Play 3.\\" The chairman of the committee, Sir Ivan Lawrence had to point out to Newson that this was incorrect, and that both the police and the British Board of Film Classification had ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder. The link between the murders and Child's Play 3 by the news media directly led to the delay of the release certification for both Natural Born Killers and Reservoir Dogs.

After completing his undergraduate education, Paul Florian moved to London and worked as a project designer for two years in the office of Sir Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall and Partners Architects RMJM under the direction of David Lloyd Jones. From 1975 to 1978, Florian attended the Architectural Association School of Architecture, concentrating his studies in urban design under the direction of Léon Krier and earning a Diploma Degree. Colleagues at the Architectural Association included David Chipperfield, Zaha Hadid, Susannah Hagan, and Ben Nicholson. Florian returned from England to the Chicago area in 1978 and worked for two years as a project designer for the architecture firm Holabird and Root. From 1981 to 1982, he attended the School of Architecture at the University of Illinois at Chicago, receiving a Master of Architecture degree. As a graduate student, he taught in the undergraduate program at UIC School of Architecture and curated the exhibition “Architecture and the City” at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Paul Florian's teaching career at the University of Illinois at Chicago continued for over a decade, from 1981 until 1994. During his tenure the School of Architecture was directed initially by Thomas Hall Beeby and subsequently by Stanley Tigerman. Florian later taught several graduate studios at the Illinois Institute of Technology. His academic experience also includes acting as juror at the Art Institute of Chicago's Schiff Foundation Fellowship for Architectural Achievement, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, and Harvard University. In 2019, Paul Florian taught an advanced design studio at the Yale School of Architecture as Robert A. M. Stern Visiting Professor. Florian opened an architectural practice called Florian Associates in Chicago's River North area in 1983. Three years later he and Stephen Wierzbowski formed Florian Wierzbowski Architecture. The firm was reorganized in 1996 and renamed Florian Architects. In 1991, Architectural Digest featured the firm in the issue “The World's Most Foremost Architects.” Florian Architects' work has been exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Chicago History Museum, the Cooper-Hewitt in New York, the Queens Museum of Art in New York, and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon. Awards and recognition Paul Florian is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Projects under his design direction have won over 25 major awards for design excellence, including a National AIA Honor Award, an AIA Illinois Frank Lloyd Wright Award, and 12 AIA Chicago awards, as well as awards and citations from the magazine publishers of Progressive Architecture, Architectural Digest, Interiors, Industrial Design, and Visual Merchandising and Space Design.

A microscope image of Medium spiny neurons (yellow) with nuclear inclusions (orange), which occur as part of the disease process. Clinical neurochemistry is the field of neurological biochemistry which relates biochemical phenomena to clinical symptomatic manifestations in humans. While neurochemistry is mostly associated with the effects of neurotransmitters and similarly-functioning chemicals on neurons themselves, clinical neurochemistry relates these phenomena to system-wide symptoms. Clinical neurochemistry is related to neurogenesis, neuromodulation, neuroplasticity, neuroendocrinology, and neuroimmunology in the context of associating neurological findings at both lower and higher level organismal functions. Neuropharmacology and drug action Efficacy spectrum of receptor ligands. The integration of knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular actions of a drug within the brain circuitry leads to an overall understanding of a neurological drug's action mechanisms. This understanding of drug action in turn can be extrapolated to account for system-wide or clinical manifestations which are observed as symptoms. The clinical effects of a neural drug are due to both immediate changes in homeostasis and long-term neural adaptations characterized by the phenomena neural plasticity. The most basic and fundamental neurological phenomena in neuropharmacology is the binding of a drug or neurologically active substance to a cellular target. One assay to determine the extent at which a ligand binds to its receptor is the radioligand binding assay (RBA), in which specific binding of a radioactively- labeled ligand is denoted by the difference between saturated and non- saturated tissue samples. While the RBA assay assumes that the tissue prepared has just one molecular target per ligand, in actuality this may not be the case. For example, serotonin binds to many diverse serotonin receptors which makes the RIA assay quite difficult to interpret. Because many receptors are essentially enzymes, the field of pharmakinetics utilizes the Michaelis–Menten equation to describe drug affinity (dissociation constant Kd) and total binding (Bmax). Although Kd and Bmax can be determined pictorally in a normal or logarithmic plot of ligand binding vs drug concentration, Scatchard plots allow for mathematical representation of several ligand binding sites, each with its own Kd. Semi-log plots of two agonists with different Kd. Drug potency is the measure of binding strength between a drug and a specific molecular target, whereas drug efficacy describes the biological effect exerted by the drug itself, at either a cellular or organismal level. Because drugs range widely in their potency and efficacy, drugs have been categorized on the spectrum of agonists and antagonists. Agonists bind to receptors and elicit the same effects as an endogenous neurotransmitter. For example, morphine is an agonist of the opioid receptor family. Conversely, antagonists bind to a receptor and elicit no cellular change. Naloxone, an antagonist of the opioid receptors, exerts a biological effect only be interfering with endogenous neurotransmitter (morphine) binding. Inverse agonists bind to receptors and elicit the opposite effect that an agonist would. The spectrum of drug continuum also includes partial agonists and partial inverse agonists, which comprise the wide majority of neurological clinical treatments. The ultimate clinical effect of a drug can be analyzed with a dose-response curve. Neurologically active substances There are many biologically active chemicals which elicit an effect on the nervous system. Neurotransmitters and similarly-functioning biochemical messengers elicit effects on postsynaptic neurons at neuronal synapses. Excitatory Amino Acids include Glutamate, whereas inhibitory Amino Acids include GABA and Glycine. Additionally, catecholamines, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, and orexins have widely- projecting effects and are often referred to as neuromodulators. Neuropeptides include bradykinin, cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), galanin, MCH, MSH, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Neurotensin, Opioids, orexin, oxytocin, somatostatin, tachykinins, TRH, CUP, and vasopressin. Purines, endogenous cannabinoids, gasses, neurotrophix factors, chemokines, and VEGF are all classified as atypical neurotransmitters. Major receptors of neurotransmitters include AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and Kainate Receptors. Clinical neurological disorders Changes in the homeostatic levels of many neurologically active chemicals elicit clinical disorders and symptoms. =Pain and inflammation= Nociception is the form of somatic sensation that detects potentially tissue-damaging noxious stimuli. Peripheral nociceptors uniquely express transient receptor potentials which are sensitive to potentially-damaging mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli. Nociceptors also contain receptors for pain and inflammatory-related mediators or cytokines. Peripheral nociceptors transmit noxious stimuli to the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal horn, and further to the trigeminal ganglia in the brain. Pain has both a localizing somatic sensory component and an aversive emotional and motivational component. Pain travels through a variety of pathways via first pain on Alpha Delta fibers and second pain on slowly conducting C-fibers. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord serves as a major integration center for both ascending nociceptive information and descending antinociceptive influences from the brain. Plasticity within the dorsal horn is mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors and key in the initiation of chronic pain by decreasing the excitability threshold in nociceptive pathways. Additionally, damage to neurons in nociceptive pathways leads to neuropathic pain. Three families in northern Pakistan were congenitally unable to perceive pain due to their homozygous loss of function mutation in the SCN9A gene which codes for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 . This key finding allowed pharmacologists to begin researching if the NaV1.7 is a substantial molecular target for analgesic (antipain) medications. Sensitization, in the clinical sense of the word, is a phenomenon in which nociceptors in an area beyond a tissue injury exhibit decreased thresholds for activation. Sensitization can be initiated by inflammatory prostaglandins or leukotrienes and are therefore the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) which block key enzymes in their synthesis. Additionally, opioid drugs suppress nociceptions by binding to endogenous opioid receptors. =Sleep and arousal= Polysomnographic record of REM Sleep. EEG highlighted by red box with eye movement highlighted by red line. Sleep arousal are active brain processes medicated and associated with specific brain regions. Despite the fact that various stages of sleep are discrete and quantifiable, the exact function of sleep is unknown. Sleep is controlled both by circadian rhythms and the homeostatic drive produced by wakefulness. Circadian rhythms are produced in the suprachiasmatic nucleus by pacemaker cells which contain transcriptional regulation \\"clock genes\\" which have been highly conserved throughout evolution. Non-REM sleep is initiated by neurons in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic area, whereas REM sleep is eventually elicited by the cells in the pontine tegmentum. Electroencephalography is used to analyze brain wave patterns during sleep and has the capability to differentiate between REM sleep from non-REM sleep. REM sleep cycles mimic conscious brain patterns to an extent. Night Terrors, for example, involve the partial arousal out of non- REM sleep. Similarly, REM Behavior Disorder occurs when patients have fits of violent behavior during REM sleep. Benzodiazepines are the most common treatments for sleep-related disorders. Dyssomnia is a class of sleep disorders which includes Primary insomnia, primary hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep discorer, and other conditions. Primary insomnia is a disorder in which a patient has difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. Behavior modification and a reduction in neurologically active substances such as caffeine and alcohol seem to be among the most promising treatments. Although the mechanism is unknown, brain plasticity and behavior modification are utilized to train patients to only go to bed when tired, associating the bed itself with a sleepy state. Narcolepsy is a condition characterized by abnormal transitions between REM and non-REM cycles during sleep and the awake cycle. Cataplexy, on the other hand, is an involuntary loss of muscle tone during wakefulness. The mechanism of narcolepsy is unknown, though recent findings suggest that orexin neurons in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus may play a critical role in reinforcing wakefulness. Narcolepsy is often treated with psychostimulants or tricyclic antidepressants in order to suppress REM sleep patterns. Sleep apnea is a common breathing disorder during sleep and is related to a disability in the central respiratory drive mechanisms. Parasomnias are a class represented by nightmares, sleep terrors, night terrors, schizophrenia, certain mood disorders, and other conditions which arise during Stage 4 of sleep. General anesthetics typically induce non-REM sleep characterized by amnesia, analgesia, immobility, and hypnosis by facilitating the inhibition of excitatory ion channels or the excitation of inhibitory ligand-gated channels. =Schizophrenia and other psychoses= Functional magnetic resonance imaging depicting differences in brain activity among people diagnosed with schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a psychological disorder in which a patient experiences symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, amotivation, social withdrawal, cognitive defects, and poor working memory. Heredity and gene inheritance is a highly important risk factor, especially for identical twins. Schizophrenia is anatomically characterized by a deterioration and loss of gray matter in the temporal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex, though the exact mechanism is unknown. What is known is that the main two neurotransmitter systems implicated in schizophrenia are the dopamine and glutamate pathways. Dopamine became a candidate for research when it was clinically noticed that antipsychotic drugs which are dopamine D2 receptor antagonists were noted to be quite successful in treating schizophrenia as well. Increased levels of dopamine in schizophrenics tend to induce paranoid delusions, ideas of reference, and auditory hallucinations. The same dopaminergic pathway is also involved in psychosis. Glutamate has become a candidate for treatment focus because glutamate blocks some NMDA receptors which, on their own, induce schizophrenic behavior. In animal models, NMDA antagonists increase glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. It is postulated that this is a homeostatic response to NMDA receptor blockade, which in turn increases psychotic symptoms. A class of NMDA receptor antagonists have been denoted dissociative anesthetics because they produce a sense of depersonalization and dissociation of subjective experience from various forms of sensory input stimuli. As such, variants such as Ketamine (Angel Dust/Special K) and Phencyclidine (PCP) have become a commonly abused street-drug. These drugs are no longer used due to harmful behavioral and addictive effects. =Neurodegeneration= Neurodegeneration is classified as a massive death of neurons, and encompasses diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. Although many cells die due to necrosis, many cells in neurodegenerative disorders are killed via the apoptotic pathway. Excitotoxicity, which involves overstimulation of a cell via its glutamate receptors, is one of the major processes which can initiate cell death. Other inducers include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal protein aggregation. Surprisingly, both necrotic and apoptotic processes utilize a similar intracellular signaling cascade which uses caspase proteins to induce cell death. Abnormal protein accumulation causes Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Alzheimer's Disease Comparison of a normal aged brain (left) and an Alzheimer's patient's brain (right). Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of severe memory impairment and is caused by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis, and neuronal loss. It is thought that Alzheimer's disease may be due to unnecessary protein accumulation of β Amyloid. In fact, Senile plaques are dense, protein deposits composed of amyloid β peptide. The two types of senile plaques are diffuse plaques and neuritic plaques, and differ in morphology. In addition to the amyloid, the microtubule-associated Tau protein has also been in involved with Alzheimer's Disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases. Inherited forms of Alzheimer's have been linked to mutation in the APP genes or presenilins which regulate APP processing. Because cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis are significantly altered during Alzheimer's progression, cholinergic agents such as choline and lecithin were hypothesized to augment the progression. However, these attempts were unsuccessful and the only clinically useful drugs used in the United States are cholinesterase inhibitors, which prolong the time before choline degradation. Although aNMDA receptor antagonists and anti-inflammatory drugs were tested in a clinical environment, more promising clinical trials are underway to targeting the Aβ with the immune system. Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is caused by the loss of dopamine stimulation to the basal ganglia of the midbrain, resulting in tremor at rest and bradykinesia. In some rare forms, protein aggregation of alpha-synuclein and parkin can elicit symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. For a variety of drugs, restoring dopamine to the central nervous system remains the target therapy. Because dopamine cannot pass the blood brain barrier on its own, the dopamine precursor L-DOPA is used in its stead. However, synaptic plasticity renders this treatment decreasingly effective with time. Another treatment option is bromocriptine, which directly stimulates D2 Dopamine Receptors. Bromocriptine is less effective than L-Dopa in reducing symptoms, but provides less dyskinesia. Often, the two drugs are used in concert with one another. New approaches to treatment include deep brain simulation and cell transplantation with stem cells. Deep brain stimulation offsets symptoms rather than cures, and stem cell studies have been extremely disappointing, despite relative success with animal models. Gene therapy may provide a novel route to introduce new dopamine production via viral-medicated gene transfection, but clinical trials are yet to be completed. Huntington's disease Huntington's disease is a disease characterized by minor coordination problems, jerking eye movements, and uncontrollable movement of peripheral limbs. Symptoms generally occur at the age of 40, and are often accompanied by depression and psychosis. The disease is caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene, on chromosome 4, which causes abnormally large numbers of glutamate residues in the protein. Via an unknown mechanism, this accumulation leads to neurodegeneration in the caudate nucleus and putamen, selectively destroying GABAnergic neurons which project to the globus pallidus. There is also significant necrosis in the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Cholinergic interneurons and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain are largely unaffected. Treatment for Huntington's disease is extremely limited due to the lack of knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of protein accumulation, though drugs used include dopamine receptor antagonists to minimize tremors and antidepressants to ameliorate symptoms of psychosis and depression.

It premiered in Leningrad's Mikhaylovsky Theatre in 1935. Plot The plot centres around a group of ballet dancers who have been sent to provide sophisticated entertainment on a new Soviet collective farm during their harvest festival. The workers, along with two older residents of a nearby dacha, welcome the city dancers, with special welcome given to the troupe's ballerina who was the former dance teacher of Zina. Zina introduces the ballerina to her husband, Pyotr, and Pyotr immediately begins to flirt with the ballerina. Hurt, Zina removes herself from the celebrations and is comforted by the ballerina. The ballerina suggests a plan in which she will dress as her dance partner, her dance partner will dress as a female dancer, and Zina will dress as the ballerina. They will fool Pyotr and the two dacha dwellers and Pyotr will realize his mistake. The woes of two other couples with overly-assured men are also resolved through the plan. After this all has been accomplished, there is a grand celebration which, in the Ratmansky production, includes the grim reaper who, after a scare, is banished.

However, an editorial in Pravda in early February 1936 condemned the ballet and, by implication, its musical suite; both works were withdrawn. Due to this, one of the librettists, Piotrovsky was arrested in November the following year and executed in a gulag. Lobukhov, as choreographer and co-librettist, likely escaped from a similar fate due to his connections through his sister Lydia Lopokova. Productions Alexei Ratmansky, currently an artist in residence at the American Ballet Theatre and the former director of the Bolshoi Ballet, first came across the full score of the ballet in a recording made by Gennady Rozhdestvensky in Stockholm in 1995. Unable to restore the original choreography of the ballet, which was never notated, Ratmansky wrote his own choreography and staged the new two act version of The Limpid Stream with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow in 2003. In July 2005 the Bolshoi performed The Bright Stream at the Met, and in August 2006, at the Royal Opera House, London. The Bolshoi performed it in Moscow during late October 2017, and is due to perform it in London during August 2019.

This rampart appears to have had only two entrances, one on the north and the other on the south side; just within the entrenchment, at the entrance on the north, is a small tumulus, which may have been constructed as a mount for observation or defense, or for the purpose of interment.The Modern Antiquarian: Grimsbury Castle The name shows that the later Saxon settlers in the region found the earthworks so impressive that they thought they must have been built by the chief of their gods, Woden alias Grim.David Nash Ford's Royal Berkshire History: Grimsbury Castle The site lies at an elevation of 155m AOD. There is an 18th-century folly on the site, also known as Grimsbury Castle. Today the site is crossed by a small, single-track roadway.

Looney Tunes theatrical animated short directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on June 6, 1964, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. It was the last Warner Bros. cartoon directed by Chuck Jones until 1980's Soup or Sonic. The title is a pun on the Leo Tolstoy novel War and Peace. Plot Wile E. Coyote (Caninus nervous rex) attempts to hurl a hand grenade at Road Runner (Burn-em upus asphaltus), but it rebounds off a saguaro, and explodes on the Coyote. He walks away, planning his next scheme. Wile E. is at another cliff, attempting to use a bow with a pulley to shoot himself at the Road Runner, with his tail being tied by a rope attached to the pulley. The pulley rope then rips the lower part of his hide off, exposing him in his underwear, and with him hanging onto the bow until it breaks. He then lands feet first on a large rock just a bit down the bottom of the cliff. Wile E. walks off in relief, until the rock breaks and falls down to the ground, taking Wile E. with it. Wile E. attempts to use a hydraulic press activated by an electric eye, when the Road Runner attempts to run through the light at the eye, the hydraulic presses can crush him after he passes. The Road Runner stops in front of the eye. The Coyote gets impatient and runs at the Road Runner, but the Road Runner walks through the eye, activating the hydraulic presses, flattening Wile E. Wile E. paints himself with ACME Invisible Paint. He hears the Road Runner beeping, jumps onto the road, but the beeps were from a truck, which runs over the Coyote. Wile E. staggers off a cliff into a pond. The splash causes Wile E. to be visible again, and he lies down on the sea floor, injured. A fish swims by and looks at him, but the Coyote scares it away by showing a \\"GET LOST!\\" sign at the fish. Wile E. uses a double-barreled shotgun as a look-through attraction called \\"Secrets of a Harem\\". The Road Runner looks through the holes of the shotgun while turning a handle, while Wile E. prepares to fire the shotgun. He looks at the Road Runner and thinking that he is turning it incorrectly, pushes him away and turns the handle himself, causing the shotgun to fire into his face. Wile E. throws a grappling hook with a rope straight up at the cliff. The hook gets caught on something, and the Coyote climbs the rope. The hook is not caught on a cliff, but a cloud above, the hook lets go of the cloud and tears it open, causing lightning to strike Coyote, who slides down to the ground. The Coyote rides a rocket up the cliff, but the shape of the cliff causes the rocket to go the wrong way and sends the Coyote into the ground. After barreling underground, he ends up in China, where he meets a Chinese Road Runner wearing a conical hat and Chinese wooden slippers. The Coyote attempts to catch him, but the Chinese Road Runner stops him with a gong. The Coyote falls back down the hole toward the desert. He flies up the hole and falls face first to the ground. The Chinese Road Runner pops his head out of the hole and ends the cartoon with a \\"Beep-beep!\\" noise with Chinese characters, which translate The End, old Chinese proverb.

The group members were introduced by Sun Studio owner Sam Phillips in 1954, except for D.J. Fontana, who joined the group during a Louisiana Hayride tour in 1955. The Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007.  Background  On July 18, 1953, Elvis Presley recorded a single in the studio as a gift for his mother's birthday, the Ink Spots' \\"My Happiness\\", with \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\" on the flipside. Presley's recording was managed by Phillips' secretary, Marion Keisker, who also kept a demo recording for the absent owner of the studio.Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. . Retrieved 2010-09-27. Keisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later, he returned on June 26, 1954, and although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the country music band Starlight Wranglers' guitarist Scotty Moore, who later introduced Presley to bassist Bill Black.  Sun recordings  On July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs \\"Harbor Lights\\" and \\"I Love You Because\\", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right\\", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded. Phillips played the recording for WHBQ's DJ Dewey Phillips, who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8. On July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to \\"That's All Right\\", an uptempo rockabilly version of Bill Monroe's \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\". The single was released on July 19, 1954, and was a local hit in Arkansas, Mississippi and New Orleans.  Live appearances  Left to right: Scotty Moore (guitar), Bill Black (bass), D.J. Fontana (drums) Scotty Moore became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. . Both Moore and Black focused more on the group after they let Presley perform at the regular Starlight Wranglers show on the Bon Air club, where the reception of the audience was unfavorable, and led to animosity between them and the other members of the group for having to leave the stage. The Blue Moon Boys appeared on a regular basis at Eagle's Nest club in Memphis, Tennessee. Sam Phillips booked the band an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry, which was not well received. After the failure, Phillips contacted Opry's main competition, the Louisiana Hayride. They made their first appearance on October 16, 1954. Presley sang \\"That's All Right\\" followed by the flipside of the record, \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\". The performance was well received and they signed a one-year contract to be official members of the Hayride, while Presley also signed a new management contract with Bob Neal. On August 8, D.J. Fontana joined the band as the drummer on a regular basis after having played occasionally with them, the first time in Shreveport and subsequently on tour. After disputes with Hank Snow's manager, Tom Parker, who booked most of Presley's appearances, Bob Neal turned over the contract to Colonel Parker who became officially Presley's manager on December 15, 1955.  RCA Records and later years  In January 1956 Presley signed a $40,000 contract with RCA Records, recording for the first time on January 10, 1956, Mae Axton's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". The Blue Moon Boys continued appearing on Presley's recordings as well as in movies like Loving You. The first live appearance of the band since Presley's army return was in 1960, during The Frank Sinatra Show's special Welcome Home Elvis. The band's last appearance was during the Elvis 1968 Comeback Special—minus Bill Black, who had died in 1965 of a brain tumor. In 2007, the Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.

It was located adjacent to the Kings Langley Royal Palace, residence of the Plantagenet English kings. History King's Langley Priory ruins depicted in 1844 Langley was founded in 1308 by Edward II in fulfilment of a vow made when in peril. On 1 December, the king made the friars a grant of £100 a year until further orders; on 20 December he gave them his garden near the church and land there for building, and the next day assigned to them as a dwelling until the priory could be built a place called 'Little London.' The first prior was John de Warefeld, who had for some time belonged to Edward's household, and in August 1315 became his confessor.Page, William; Doubleday, Herbert Arthur The Victoria History of the County of Hertford: Volume 4, 1971, pp.446-451 The king in March 1312 gave the brothers 700 marks for building expenses, and in the summer of that year the conventual church was dedicated and a cemetery consecrated. Possibly, however, the church was not yet finished, for the body of Piers Gaveston, who was killed about this time, was not buried there until the end of 1314, when the ceremony took place with much state, the Archbishop of Canterbury and four bishops as well as many other ecclesiastics taking part in the funeral rites. In October 1311 the king increased the annual income of the house to £150 to provide for fifteen friars added since the foundation, so that his grant in September 1312 of 500 marks during pleasure may have been intended for building purposes. He gave the friars in June 1315 a house with closes in his manor of Langley and leave to take wood for fuel and other necessaries from Chipperfield Wood. During some years of scarcity he also supplied them with corn. The king, however, felt that this state of dependence on the Exchequer was unsatisfactory, and wished to endow them permanently. To overcome the difficulty that friars-preachers could not own property he proposed to found a house of Dominican nuns, who were to hold lands in trust for the brothers, and in 1318 he sent two friars to the pope for his authorization. Robert de Duffeld, the second Prior of King's Langley and the king's confessor, had been dispatched in October 1316 to the master of the order, apparently on the same errand, but nothing was done in the matter for years. The drawback to allowances is shown in the complaint of the friars to Edward III in 1345 that owing to the irregularity of the payments from the Exchequer they had not wherewith to live, carry on the works they had begun, and pay their debts. On this occasion, at their request, the money due to the king from the alien priory of Harmondsworth was assigned to them in part payment. Edward III seems to have been as much interested in the house as his father had been. In 1346 he granted the friars part of a quarry in Shotover for their works, and in 1347 gave them leave to enlarge the ditch round their close 3 ft. in breadth and 2,000 ft. in length. He gave them in April 1358 the fishery of his water of King's Langley with permission to have a weir in that water, and free entrance and exit to and from the weir through his park; also the head of a stream in Abbots Langley with leave to dig up his land in making an aqueduct underground to their house. In January 1361-2 he gave them, moreover, £20 a year during pleasure to their new work. Personal feeling seems to have prompted his grant in 1358 of 4 tuns of wine a year, and the gift in 1377 of forty mazers, one of which was called the Edward. The wish of Edward II was at last carried out in 1349, and a house of Dominican sisters founded at Dartford in Kent, which was regarded as the complement of the Dominican friary at King's Langley;[Victoria County History (1926)- Kent: Volume 2, Friaries: 29. The Dominican Nuns of Dartford.] and in December 1356 the prioress and nuns had licence to acquire in mortmain property to the value of £300 for the sustenance of themselves and the friars of King's Langley. Here the brothers possibly owed something to the influence of John Woderowe, the king's confessor, who in June 1356 is mentioned as their prior. Still, the foundation of Dartford for some time did not change materially the financial position of Langley. The king in October 1363 granted to the convent of twenty brothers 200 marks a year of his alms and in March 1371 ordered that the money should be paid to them from the issues of the alien priory of Burstall. But the appropriation of the church of Langley in 1374 to the nuns of Dartford is the beginning of a new arrangement. In October 1376 Edward III made over to John Duke of Lancaster, Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and others in trust for the convent at Langley, the hundred and manor of Preston and the manors of Overland in Ash, Elmstone, Wadling in Ripple, Packmanstone in Newchurch, Harrietsham, 'Godmeston', Beaurepaire, Waldeslade in Chatham, Ham and Westgate in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, and these were granted to the friars from Easter 1382 for forty years, with the idea that during this term they might be secured to them in frankalmoin. The convent let them to Simon de Burley, who shortly afterwards received a grant of them in fee simple from Richard II. The brothers in 1383-4 represented to the king that the rent was much in arrears, and begged that King Edward's intention might be fulfilled and the lands given to them in mortmain; but this was not done, for in September 1386 the king assigned to them the farm of the alien priory of Ware instead of the manors held by Burley. After Burley's execution and forfeiture in 1388 the friars were allowed possession of the property pending inquiry into the king's right, but complained that they and their sureties were harassed by the Exchequer, while large sums due from Burley were still owing. The desired Letters patent were not, however, granted until 24 April 1399, when the king considering that the house of King's Langley 'was not yet sufficiently built and endowed, and as the foundation required', gave the manors to the nuns of Dartford in frankalmoin to hold for the friars. Five years earlier they had acquired in the same way from Richard II the advowson of Willian, Hertfordshire, and from John Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury, and Warin Waldegrave that of Great Gaddesden, with leave in both cases to appropriate the churches to their own uses. When Richard died in February 1400 he was at first buried at Langley Priory; afterwards, however, his body was removed by order of Henry V to Westminster Abbey. But the conventual church of Langley still retained a sign of the priory's connexion with the royal family in the tomb of Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, interred here in 1402 beside his wife, Isabella, the daughter of Peter, King of Castile. Henry IV in 1399 and Henry V in 1413 confirmed the grants made to the friars, who therefore could easily prove their title to the Kentish manors, when the escheator seized them in 1420 on the expiration of the term for which they had originally been given. The experience showed the expediency of royal confirmations, and the prior and convent obtained the ratification of their charters from Henry VI in 1424, Edward IV in 1466, Henry VII in 1486, and in 1510 from Henry VIII. =Richard Wycherley= The house seems to have been now provided with an income, not only assured but sufficient. The certain livelihood it offered is said to have been the reason why Richard Wycherley, a former prior promoted to be Bishop of 'Olivence', asked to be appointed prior again about 1497, and this time for life. He promised that he would live under the obedience of the provincial, enrich the house with his own possessions, require only the same living as priors usually had, and render due account of the revenues of the priory. The post was given to him, but according to the story of his successor the appointment was not to the convent's benefit: after four years of office he was £64 in debt to the house. In his last illness he desired that the sum should be paid, and in further recompense of charges on the priory caused by his episcopal dignity he bequeathed to the convent his crozier and mitre worth £40. After his death his executors sued the prior and convent for some of his property — a silver ewer and holy water stock, a counterpane and a dozen napkins. The friars declared that they belonged to the house, and the bishop had them in pledge, and asked that the trial of the case in Worcestershire might be stopped as detrimental to their interests. The friars may have been wronged, but it must be owned that their tale is not very plausible, for it is unlikely that they would pawn goods to a person in their debt. =Richard Yngworth= The house was subjected to an attack on its rights and property in 1533 by one Verney, when Thomas Cromwell showed himself disposed in their favour. Richard Yngworth, the prior, on 16 December sent him a present of apples, and thanked him for his help and counsel to the provincial superior, John Hilsey, by which he himself was enabled to serve God quietly and keep his study and office without trouble. Verney several months later was still causing the convent annoyance and loss, but the prior would not take steps against him without Cromwell's leave. Yngworth's attitude here expresses his policy, which was complete subservience to Cromwell, naturally for his own advancement. In April 1534 he went on a visitation to the eastern counties to secure the acknowledgement by the friars of the king's claim to be supreme head of the English Church, and later made himself useful to Hilsey elsewhere in the same business. The convent at Langley, needless to say, made the formal declaration required. Yngworth's labours were not unnoticed. When Hilsey was made Bishop of Rochester, Thomas Bedell wrote to Cromwell recommending that the Prior of Langley, 'who had taken great pains in the king's matters,' should have the office of provincial; Russell also urged his appointment. The post, however, was not vacant, and Yngworth had to wait for preferment until December 1537, being then made Suffragan Bishop of Dover. Probably he ceased to be Prior of King's Langley from that time. He was commissioned by the king in February 1538 to visit all friaries in England, and in May he was ordered to put their goods into safe custody and take inventories of them, evidently in preparation for suppression. Langley was surrendered towards the end of that year. Many of the friars were very old and poor, but it is doubtful whether any provision was made for them. Yngworth begged for the house immediately, and in February 1540 it was granted to him with most of its lands, to be held until he obtained ecclesiastical benefices worth £100 a year. The priory was reckoned in the Valor of 1535 as worth £122 4s. a year clear, a fairly accurate estimate, to judge from the statement at the Dissolution. Its gross annual value was then said to be £130 16s. 8d., but to this must be added £11 13s. 4d. for the obits of Sir John Cheyne and Sir Ralph Verney, so that its net income after the deduction of £18 6s. 8d. for salaries and other payments was £124 3s. 4d. It is impossible to ascertain the size of the convent at any period. Edward II intended the house to hold a hundred, but there is no proof that it ever did. His allowance of £50 extra for fifteen brothers in 1311 implies that there were then forty-five here. Edward III in 1356 gave licence to the nuns of Dartford to acquire land sufficient to maintain forty sisters and sixty friars, but the number he actually provided for at Langley from the Exchequer did not exceed twenty, apparently increased by twenty under his will. =Refounded= The priory of King's Langley was refounded by Philip and Mary in June 1557 as a house of Dominican sisters, at the request, and for the benefit of seven nuns, formerly at Ingress Abbey, Dartford, Kent. The prioress and convent were declared a corporate body, having perpetual succession and power to acquire property and to sue and be sued at law. They were given the house and site of the late friary, the land called 'le Courte Wike' in King's Langley which had belonged to the priory, and a house and buildings within 'the old manor' lying near the pales of the royal park. On 8 September 1558 the king and queen granted to the Prioress and convent of Langley the reversion of certain tenements in Dartford, formerly demesne lands of the nuns of that place, and until the expiration of the lease, the rent of £30 7s. 7d. They gave also, besides other demesne lands, the house of the late nunnery with the property in Dartford assigned after its suppression to Anne of Cleves, and it has been supposed that the nuns now returned to Dartford. In any case, the convent's existence was very short. Queen Mary died in November of that year, and by an Act passed in Elizabeth's first Parliament all restorations or foundations of monasteries since the death of Edward VI were made void, and their possessions given to the Crown. =Present ownership= Early in the 20th century the property came into the ownership of Margaret Cross, who adapted it for use as a school. It is now united with the adjoining property, the site of Kings Langley Palace, in the ownership of the Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley, which was closed in March 2019.Coombe Hill School, later Priory School, Kings Langley Other burials *Anne de Mortimer *Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall *Thomas Plantagenet, twelfth child of King Edward III *Ralph Stafford (died 1385) Priors of King's Langley Elizabeth Cressener was the only prioress of Langley.

On either side of him is a shield not of the arms of Edward II, but of France and England. Of the legend only two letters survive. A later seal, also a pointed oval, represents the Christian God in majesty. In the base, under a carved four-centred arch, is the king as in the earlier seal. The inner border is engrailed. Legend: SIGILLUM : COVUNE : FRATRUM : PREDIB : DE : LANGELEYE. A 16th-century seal, of the same shape but slightly larger, shows the coronation of the Virgin in a niche with two-arched canopy. On each side there is a smaller canopied niche; the one on the left containing St. Margaret, crowned, standing on the dragon, which she pierces with a long cross, and holding in her right hand a book; in that on the right is an archbishop with mitre and crozier. Below is the founder on his knees under a carved roundheaded arch; he holds a church and in front of him on the ground is his crown. Legend: . . . . VENT . MONAST'II DE LAN . . Y. The counterseal shows two impressions of a shield-shaped signet with arms, a bend engrailed between six fleurs de lis with three crosslets fitchy on the bend, the ownership of which is unknown.

He fell in love with one of his students during a rare snowday in the city. That day he asked poet Zef Pali for a short text for a song to represent the girl as a snowflower in the text itself, and Pali prepared the poem that same day. Gjoni added the music to the words.

The fifth and final single, 1988's \\"No Pain, No Gain\\" reached a dismal 74 on the R&B; chart, while limping to number 81 in the UK.

It is native to China and Korea, and it is known in many other parts of the world as an introduced species and sometimes an invasive noxious weed. It easily inhabits moist habitat with saline soils. It may grow as a tree with a single trunk or as a shrub with several spreading erect branches reaching 6 metres or more in maximum height. It has been known to reach 12 metres.Sheppard, W. D. (2008). Tamarix chinensis. In: Bonner, F. T., et al. The Woody Plant Seed Manual. Agric. Handbook No. 727. Washington, DC. USDA, Forest Service. p. 1087-1088. It has reddish, brown, or black bark. The small, multibranched twigs are covered in small lance-shaped, scale-like leaves which are no more than about 3 mm long. The inflorescence is a dense raceme of flowers a few cm long. Each fragrant flower has five petals which are usually pink but range from white to red. This tamarisk can hybridize with Tamarix parviflora. T. ramosissima may be treated in synonymy or as a separate species. It has become an aggressive invader of wildlands in the southwestern United States, where it was once planted as an ornamental plant. It reproduces vegetatively from its roots and also from its foliage if it happens to be covered by soil, as in sediment-rich flooding. It also reproduces by its seed, which are tiny and tufted with hairs, easily dispersing on the wind. Despite its reputation as a noxious weed, the tree can be useful for wood, in honey production, and as a nesting site for various birds. In its native habitat in China the plant forms thickets that act as useful barriers on the margins of waterways, including saline ocean shores.

This concept is not clearly enunciated in the written Torah, but was accepted by the Talmud as being a biblical mandate. It is linked in the Talmud from the biblical law requiring people to assist in unloading burdens from animals ().Bava Metzia 32b Literal meaning Tza'ar is an (ancient) Hebrew word for \\"suffering\\" and is used in this context with the meaning of \\"suffering that does not advance some legitimate human good\\", according to The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality. Ba'alei chayim is an expression literally meaning \\"owners of life\\", which is used in the Talmud for \\"animals.\\"Rabbi Yonatan Neril and Evonne Marzouk of Canfei Nesharim, Compassion Toward Animals and Tza'ar Ba'alei Chaim prepared as part of the Jewcology project Laws =Slaughter= In traditional Jewish law, kosher animals may be eaten if they're killed using the slaughter method known as shechitah, where the animal is killed by having its throat cut swiftly using an extremely sharp and specially designed knife. Many rabbis assert that these regulations were put in place to reduce the animal's suffering and to ensure that the animal has the easiest possible death.Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, III:48 The design of the kosher knives as well as regulation relating to how the cut is made have been seen to greatly reduce or completely eliminate reaction from the kosher cut. Even modern day scientists that are critical of shechita agree that it greatly improved welfare at slaughter in historical periods. Though, there is disagreement as to shechita's effectivity when compared to modern day slaughter methods, with some scientific experts in favor of the humaneness of shechita and others opposed. In 2000, the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards banned the common slaughter method of \\"shackling and hoisting\\" (pulling a conscious animal into the air with a chain before slaughter). Rabbis Joel Roth and Elliot Dorff wrote a responsum on this topic which concluded that shackling and hoisting \\"unquestionably constitutes a violation of Jewish laws that forbid us to cause undue pain to animals.\\"http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/dorffroth_shackling.pdf =Animal research= According to the Shulkhan Aruch, \\"anything that is necessary for medical purposes, or for anything else, is exempt from the prohibition of causing suffering to animals\\".Even ha-Ezer 5:14 Most Jewish authorities allow medical research if it will help people in need, and if the animals do not undergo any unnecessary suffering. Reform Judaism's Central Conference of American Rabbis, for example, affirms that animal research is permissible if it will save human lives, so long as animals are subjected to little pain and not used in \\"frivolous\\" experiments such as cosmetic testing. =In the Noahide Code= A concern for suffering caused to animals is found in Judaism's Seven Laws of Noah, which apply to all humankind. One of the seven laws, ever min ha chai, prohibits eating the flesh of live animals. This law is derived from , as interpreted in the Talmud.Sanhedrin 59a = Vegetarianism and veganism = A number of authorities have described tza'ar ba'alei chayim as requiring or leading to the adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet. Israeli rabbi Asa Kesiar has argued that the slaughter of animals in contemporary times violates tza'ar ba'alei chayim and should not be considered kosher. Israeli rabbi Simchah Roth has argued that contemporary slaughter \\"constitutes cruelty to animals [tza'ar ba'alei chayim] which is forbidden by the Torah.\\" American rabbi Geoffrey Claussen has written that considering tza'ar ba'alei chayim may lead to \\"committing to a vegan diet and boycotting the animal agriculture industry.\\" American author Richard H. Schwartz has claimed that tza'ar ba'alei chayim is a central reason for Jews to become vegetarians. =Other areas of concern for animals in Jewish law= Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit down to eat.See Talmud, Tractate Gittin, Page 62A At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work. A prohibition against using two different kinds of animals teamed together, such as ploughing or doing other work, is derived from the Torah in and the Mishnah in tractate Kila'yim elaborates upon this prohibition. The underlying concern is for the welfare of the animals, particularly the weaker of the pair. Sports like bullfighting are forbidden by most authorities. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef has characterized bullfighting as \\"a culture of sinful and cruel people\\" which is opposed by Torah values. Narrative traditions One midrash declares compassion for animals to have been the merit of Moses that made him the shepherd of his people.Exodus Rabbah 2 This midrash has sometimes been linked with tza'ar ba'alei chayim. In one narrative in the Babylonian Talmud, Judah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.Talmud, Baba Metzia 85a This midrash has sometimes also been linked with tza'ar ba'alei chayim. Organizations =The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute= The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute is a Jewish animal protection group that educates leaders, trains advocates, and leads campaigns for the humane treatment of animals. Shamyim V'Aretz is led by rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz and has run campaigns which seek to end: kosher certification of veal, the practice of kapparot, and the kosher certifying of cattle that are killed using shackle and hoist techniques. =Magen Tzedek= Enforcing a commitment to tza'ar ba'alei chayim in food production has been part of the effort of Conservative Judaism's Magen Tzedek commission, formerly known as Hekshher Tzedek. The Magen Tzedek commission sees compliance with the Humane Farm Animal Care Standards (HFAC) as sufficiently preventing unnecessary suffering to animals.http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/hekhsher%20tzedek/Hekhsher%20Tzedek%20Policy%20Statement%20and%20Working%20Guidelines_PUBLIC%20VERSION_draft2.pdf Amid disputed claims of Orthodox opposition the Magen Tzedek commission has not been successful in recruiting any food producers into its certification program. =The Jewish Initiative For Animals (JIFA)= The Jewish Initiative For Animals supports innovative programs that seek to turn the Jewish value of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into action and build Jewish American communities in the process. In November 2016 JIFA partnered with kosher meat distributors KOL Foods and Grow and Behold to bring a run of kosher certified heritage breed chickens to market for the first time in approximately 50 years. Heritage breed chickens and turkeys are able to achieve highest possible welfare outcomes. Thus, the renewed availability of heritage chicken to kosher consumer has helped expand values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim within the modern kosher meat industry. JIFA has also sought to spread the values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into the Jewish world through its Ark Project, a service- learning curriculum for b’nai mitzvah. This curriculum seeks to engages with Jewish teaching and real life problems about topics such as homeless animals, animals used in entertainment, farmed animal welfare, conservation of wildlife and more.

She is portrayed by British actress Sophia Myles. Beth Bailey was introduced in Spooks's ninth series as a private contractor in her first episode, and later joins Section D. The character is based on a real-life person Myles met while working on the series. Reaction towards the character was generally positive. Role in Spooks =Character arc= At age 18, Beth trained with MI6 while studying at the University of Edinburgh. She eventually decided she didn't want to work with them, and worked as a private contractor. At 22, she worked with a Colombian militant group as a way to anger her father, until she realised what she got herself into and left. She first appears in the series nine premiere disguised as a prostitute in a freighter from Tangier, working to track Hussein Abib, a Somali terrorist Lucas North (Richard Armitage) was sent to kill. They both escape the ship when Abib's men take control of the ship. Afterwards, Beth reveals that a Colombian drug lord built submersibles to smuggle drugs; because of this, MI5 learn Abib is using the submersibles to smuggle explosives to the Houses of Parliament. After they stop the attack, Harry instates her to MI5 officer. In the next episode, Harry plans on dismissing her after she is lying to the team; she appears to work with an assassin, but she successfully explains her subterfuge as \\"the way we used to work\\" to avoid any damage. Lucas later gives her another chance after he is promoted to head of Section D. In the fourth episode, Beth successfully turns Kai from Chinese intelligence to become an asset, the first time MI5 was able to do so. =Characteristics= Actress Sophia Myles said that Beth believes Dimitri Levendis, (Max Brown) to be her closest ally because of their same age and time they joined MI5, comparing the two as \\"new kids at school\\". Because Bailey knew Harry 12 years previously, she feels \\"very comfortable already with him.\\" In a separate interview, Myles stated that Lucas is \\"highly suspicious of her because she's highly confident\\" and that Beth \\"likes him more than he likes her.\\" Conceptual history Sophia Myles portrays Beth Bailey. The character Beth Bailey and portraying actress Sophia Myles was first revealed in March 2010 as a replacement for Jo Portman (played by Miranda Raison), who left Spooks during the eighth series. Bailey is based on a real-life person, whom Myles met while working in the series, but unlike the person, the producers added elements to make Beth a darker character. Before joining the series, Myles had never seen an episode of Spooks, but caught up by watching the first and eighth series so she would know \\"where [she] was coming in.\\" Myles felt nervous becoming part of an established series, comparing herself as the \\"new kid on the block\\" and \\"like joining the Big Brother house late.\\" Though Myles posed as a prostitute for her first episode as Beth, she felt that the outfit she worn was \\"the most hideous, most unattractive outfit\\" she ever worn. When questioned about the possibility of the death of her character, Myles stated; \\"you'd be an idiot not to expect your death at some point because that's the way they roll on this show.\\" Since the cast \\"never stop running\\" in the series, Myles trained by running around her local park once or twice a week. Despite this, she does not perform many of her own stunts. On April 2011, it was revealed that Myles would not reprise her role as Beth Bailey in the tenth series, indicating the character would be \\"decommissioned.\\" Reception Reaction towards the character by critics are generally positive. Reflecting on the departure of Ros Myers, Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk believed that Beth \\"looks poised to bring a refreshingly brash self-confidence to the party.\\" Comparing some of Sophia Myles' earlier roles, Vicky Power of The Daily Telegraph said that her \\"grubby debut\\" in Spooks is \\"noteworthy\\" because of a \\"leap from the crinolined English roses we've seen her play up to now in costume dramas such as Mansfield Park, The Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby and Tristan & Isolde. In review of the second episode of series nine, Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror stated that Myles \\"is already proving to be a most exciting addition to the Spooks team,\\" and Beth can \\"handle herself pretty well.\\" References External links * Beth Bailey at BBC.co.uk Television characters introduced in 2010 Fictional British people Fictional characters based on real people Fictional mercenaries Fictional secret agents and spies Spooks (TV series) characters ","title":"Beth Bailey"},{"id":"28974107","text":"The Nano-Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for Infrared Exploration (Nano- JASMINE) is an astrometric microsatellite developed by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, with contributions by the University of Tokyo Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory. , the satellite was planned for launch together with CHEOPS (Characterising Exoplanets Satellite) in 2019. However, this launch is no longer (as of 2019) considered. Some sources name 2020 or 2021 as the launch year of the satellite.http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/JASMINE Spacecraft Nano- JASMINE is a microsatellite measuring and weighing approximately . It carries a small, Ritchey–Chrétien telescope that will make observations in the infrared spectrum, allowing for easier observation toward the center of the Milky Way. Its exterior is covered with GaAs solar cells providing approximately 20 watts of power. Due to limited bandwidth, Nano-JASMINE will employ a Star Image Extractor (SIE) for onboard raw image processing that will extract and transmit only specific object data. Overview Nano-JASMINE is Japan's first and the world's third astrometric survey spacecraft, following Hipparcos (1989) and Gaia (2013), both launched by the European Space Agency. It is the pathfinder in a planned series of three spacecraft of increasing size and capability; the second is Small-JASMINE with a telescope, and the third being JASMINE with an telescope. The spacecraft is designed to have an astrometric accuracy (2-3 mas for stars less than 7.5 magnitude) comparable to Hipparcos (1 mas). Nano-JASMINE should be able to detect approximately four times the number of stars as Hipparcos. Given the time difference between these missions, combining the data sets of Nano-JASMINE and Hipparcos will constrain the positions of stars whose current positions are poorly known owing to uncertainty in their motion since being measured by Hipparcos, and should provide an order-of-magnitude increase in the accuracy of proper motion measurements (approximately 0.1 mas/year; 0.2 mas/year for stars less than 9 magnitude). Nano-JASMINE had been scheduled for launch aboard a Tsyklon-4 rocket from the Brazilian Space Agency's Alcântara Launch Center. The launch was originally contracted for August 2011, but was delayed to the November 2013 to March 2014 time frame. Various issues have held back its launch, first due to delays in both the construction of the launch site and development of the launch vehicle, and later due to Brazil backing out of the Tsyklon-4 partnership with Ukraine leading to the rocket's indefinite hold. In March 2015, talks to arrange a flight for Nano-JASMINE began between NAOJ and the European Space Agency. It was to be launched as a piggyback payload with CHEOPS on a Soyuz rocket in 2019. This launch is no longer (as of 2019) considered for Nano-JASMINE. As of 2019, the launch of Nano-JASMINE is foreseen in 2020 or 2021. As of August 2019 the JASMINE project website shows the mission overview of Small-JASMINE including a plan and schedule with a planned launch of Small-JASMINE for 2024 with an Epsilon Rocket.

Catalano once said that the flower \\"is a synthesis of all the flowers and, at the same time, a hope reborn every day at opening.\\" It was created in 2002. The sculpture was designed to move, closing its petals in the evening and opening them in the morning. The sculpture is located in the center of a park of four acres of wooded boundaries, surrounded by paths that get closer and provide different perspectives of the monument, and placed above a reflecting pool, which apart from fulfilling its aesthetic function, protects it. It represents a large flower made of stainless steel with aluminum skeleton and reinforced concrete, which looks up at the sky, extending to its six petals. It weighs eighteen tons and is 23 meters high.  Opening and closing of the flower One of the characteristics of the flower is an electrical system that automatically opens and closes the petals depending on the time of the day. At night the flower closes, emanating a red glow from inside, and reopens (\\"...is reborn...\\") the following morning. This mechanism also closes the flower if strong winds blow. It opens every morning at 8 and closes at sunset, on a schedule that changes according to the season. When its petals were inaugurated, they didn't close due to technical problems which were solved two months later. There are four special nights in which the petals are open: May 25, September 21, December 24 and December 31. According to Eduardo Catalano, the author, Floralis \\"means belonging to the flora and therefore the flowers\\", and Genérica \\"from the concept of \\"gender\\" and indicates that it represents all the flowers in the world\\". The electronics employed in opening and closing the flower were disabled in 2010 to prevent damaging the sculpture, and it remained permanently open until 2015. This was due to the fact that one of the petals was incorrectly installed during its assembly, as noted by Catalano himself. The company responsible for its construction, Lockheed Martin Aircraft Argentina, provided a 25-year warranty, but as the company was nationalized in 2009 its repair was delayed. The mechanism was functional again by June 2015.  Measurements  * 23 meters high * Diameter: ** Petals closed: 26 meters **Petals open: 32 meters * Diameter of the reflecting pool: 44 metersCarlos M.

City of St. Albert - Heritage Sites The park also features the St. Albert Railway Station and Visitor Centre, a replica of the former 1909 St. Albert Canadian Northern Railway railway station, built in 2005. The museum is operated by the Arts & Heritage Foundation of St. Albert. Guided tours of the Grain Elevators and Railway Station are available from May to September.  Restoration  While grain elevators are rapidly disappearing from the Prairies, the St Albert Grain Elevators have a new lease on life as they have been restored for future generations to enjoy and experience. St. Albert's 1906 and 1929 Albert Wheat Pool Elevators were constructed in the golden age of Canada's grain trade. After significant restoration, St. Albert's grain elevators will remain distinctive symbols of our heritage and stand as icons of a way of life and of the province itself. The grain elevators reopened to the public in 2011 after a year-long restoration. The restoration project included repairs and stabilization of the foundations, roofs re-shingled, metal cladding secured and repainted, rotten timbers replaced and windows restored. Work continued into 2011 on the 1929 elevator, which had considerable more rot then the 1906 elevator, included residing and repainting the elevators with the Alberta Wheat Pool colour and logo. Throughout the project, the City of St. Albert, Arts and Heritage, HIP architects and Delnor Construction worked closely with the Provincial Heritage Advisor to ensure all restoration work complied with the Standards and Guidelines for the Preservation of Historic Places in Canada.

He was appointed to the special council assembled to fight the plague in the papal states and was Prefect of the Tridentine Council from 1661 until his death. Papal conclaves Sacchetti was presented by Antonio Barberini, at the instruction of Cardinal Mazarin, the French first minister, as the French nomination for the papacy at the papal conclave of 1644. So certain of victory was Sacchetti's brother Matteo, that he threw open the doors of his cellar and began giving away wine in celebration shouting, \\"Viva Papa Sacchetti!\\" (Long live Pope Sacchetti!). Contemporary John Bargrave suggested Matteo's certainty stemmed from the fact that the Barberini (two of whom were cardinals and nephews of the previous Pope Urban VIII) had started referring to him as Your Eminence; a title reserved for cardinals, suggesting his brother's elevation to the papacy (and thus his own to the cardinalate) was imminent. However, Sacchetti was not a popular choice with the people of Rome who were afraid he would pursue Barberini policies and practices if elected. To this end they devised a rhyming ditty expressing: 'Don't make Sacchetti pope or Rome will fall to pieces'.Non fate Papa Sacchetti, se non Rome sara a pezzetti Zirpolo (2005),98 Spain, fearing he would be pro-French, vetoed his nomination via its representative Cardinal Gil de Albornoz.

History The Territory of Kansas was opened to settlement by the Kansas–Nebraska Act on May 30, 1854. Reverend Samuel Y. Lum of Middletown, New York was sent by the American Home Missionary Society to establish what was to become the first church in the new city of Lawrence and the entire Kansas Territory. Prior to his arrival, sermon readings were conducted by laymen. The first service of Plymouth Congregational Church was held by Lum on October 1, 1854 in a mudbrick boarding house, also called the \\"hay tent,\\" with settlers who had come from New England. Reverend Richard Cordley became pastor in 1857, when the congregation moved into its first permanent building, called the \\"Stone Church,\\" though it was not completed until 1862. Cordley was an abolitionist and supported the free state movement. During the American Civil War, several members were killed by pro-Confederate forces led by William Quantrill in the Lawrence Massacre of 1863.

It was written by Brad Falchuk, directed by Bradley Buecker and premiered on Fox on November 9, 2010. In \\"Never Been Kissed\\", the glee club members are assigned a boys against girls singing competition. The bullying of club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) intensifies, but he meets a new ally in Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), the lead singer of a rival glee club. Puck (Mark Salling) is released from juvenile detention and forms a friendship with Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), and football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) is hurt when she learns that several of the students are visualizing her to quell their amorous moods. The episode began a story arc about bullying which spanned the remainder of the season. It coincided with a spate of suicides among bullied youths, which reportedly gave the cast and crew additional inspiration to do their best work. Six songs were covered—four in the form of two mash-ups—and all were released as singles which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Critics were less enthused by the mash-ups than the other performances; Criss's cover of \\"Teenage Dream\\" was particularly well-received, and became the first Glee single to top the Billboard Digital Songs chart. 10.99 million US viewers watched \\"Never Been Kissed\\". It was one of six episodes that were submitted to the judges for Glee nomination in the Outstanding Comedy Series category at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. Jones received an Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination for her work on the show, and submitted this episode for judging. Reviewers approved of her performance but were very critical of her storyline and polarized by the plotting of the bullying story, though they generally approved of the episode's Puck and Artie sub-plot. Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces the second New Directions boys against girls singing competition.The first such competition is seen in the season one episode \\"Vitamin D\\". He later sees a shaken Kurt Hummel in the hallway—he had been slammed against a locker by school bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler)—and takes Kurt to his office to recover. Kurt criticizes both the school's failure to act against homophobic bullying and the lack of challenge in the club's competition; Will decides to modify the assignment to have the teams perform songs by groups of different genders. Kurt is happier with the new spin, but the other boys are unreceptive to his ideas for their team. Puck is especially dismissive, and suggests that he go spy on the Dalton Academy Warblers, one of their competitors at the forthcoming Sectionals round of show choir competition. The girls' team decides on and sings a mash-up of \\"Start Me Up / Livin' on a Prayer\\". Kurt visits Dalton Academy, an all-boys private school, and watches the Warblers perform \\"Teenage Dream\\". He is befriended by lead singer Blaine Anderson, who is also gay and encourages Kurt to stand up for himself. The next time he is attacked by Karofsky, Kurt confronts him in the boys' locker room, and as the argument intensifies he is kissed by Karofsky, which leaves Kurt stunned. After Kurt tells Blaine of this, he and Kurt later try to talk to Karofsky about the difficulties and confusion his homosexual feelings must be causing him, but he denies that anything happened and soon returns to bullying Kurt. Puck has been granted early release from juvenile detention on the condition that he performs community service. He picks Artie Abrams, a paraplegic, to fulfill that service, and the two busk in the school courtyard. They sing a duet of \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" while Puck surreptitiously intimidates their schoolmates into giving donations. He then helps Artie get back together with Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), by setting up a double date with them and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Puck's caseworker Joan Martin (Michael Hyatt) had believed he was working to rehabilitate gang members, and tells him he will have to return to the detention center unless he finds an alternative type of service. Puck admits to Artie that despite his bravado, he was miserable when locked up and does not want to return; Artie convinces him to complete the required real community service and offers to tutor him in school. Some members of New Directions, who need to cool their arousal while making out, discover that picturing football coach Shannon Beiste is very effective. When she finds out about their technique, Beiste is deeply hurt and submits her resignation. Will attempts to convince her to stay, and gives her a friendly kiss when she admits she has never been kissed. He then invites Beiste to watch the boys' competition performance; they apologize, dedicate their mash-up of \\"Stop! In the Name of Love / Free Your Mind\\" to her, and win her forgiveness. Production Darren Criss (pictured) debuted in this episode. He auditioned for multiple roles on the series before being cast as Blaine. \\"Never Been Kissed\\" was written by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, directed by Bradley Buecker, and premiered on November 9, 2010. It launched a story arc about bullying, which Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy had been building to for a season and a half. He explained that he wanted Kurt to reach a point where he would not accept the abusive treatment he received any more, and planned to follow the developments through the rest of the year, as all of the other characters were affected. The revelation that Karofsky's antagonism stemmed from his own homosexual feelings was based on a personal acquaintance of Murphy's. After the episode had been written, a spate of suicides occurred around the nation among teenage victims of bullying, which Murphy said added extra significance to \\"Never Been Kissed\\" and \\"ignite[d] the cast and the crew to do their best and push themselves with the story.\\" The episode introduced Criss as Blaine, a gay member of a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a \\"cute, charismatic, gay high school junior\\" who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once for the role of Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, \\"At this point, Kurt's [sexuality] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [being gay] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [struggling with] the same things that he had to deal with, and I think he wants to impart that knowledge.\\" Murphy described Blaine as a character with \\"great self-loathing\\" and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the \\"immediate outcry\\" from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically. Other recurring characters who appeared were glee club members Sam and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), jock bully Dave Karofsky, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), students Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), and Coach Shannon Beiste. Although Beiste's physical appearance was used as comedy in the episode, Jones was not offended; she called it hysterical, said \\"it serves a purpose for the message\\" and hoped \\"maybe it will make people think outside of the show.\\" Murphy intended her storyline to highlight the fact that bullying can be damaging without necessarily being overt. He stated: \\"Th[e] episode is completely about accountability. If you can change any young impressionable minds and make them aware of the consequences of their actions and all different forms of cruelty, I think that’s a great, great gift.\\" Telly Leung and Titus Makin, Jr. guest starred as Wes and David respectively, two additional members of the Dalton Academy Warblers. Hyatt guest starred as Joan Martin, Puck's probation officer. The episode featured cover versions of \\"Teenage Dream\\" by Katy Perry, \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" by Bob Marley & the Wailers, and mash-ups of The Rolling Stones' \\"Start Me Up\\" with Bon Jovi's \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\", and The Supremes' \\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" with En Vogue's \\"Free Your Mind\\". All of the songs performed were released as singles, available for download, and \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" are featured on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 4. \\"Teenage Dream\\" was later also included as the opening track on the seventh soundtrack album, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers. The background vocals of \\"Teenage Dream\\" were provided by collegiate a cappella group the Beelzebubs from Tufts University. Reception =Ratings= During its original broadcast, \\"Never Been Kissed\\" was watched by 10.99 million American viewers and attained a 4.6/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic. Its rating was a season low to that point; however, Glee was the top-rated show for the night of broadcast in all under-50 categories. It was the most-viewed scripted show of the week amongst adults 18–49, and ranked twenty-first amongst all viewers. In Australia, the episode was watched by 1.081 million viewers, a decline from previous weeks, which was attributed by David Dale of The Sydney Morning Herald to many regular viewers being away on Schoolies week. In Canada, 1.97 million viewers watched the episode, placing twelfth for the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.64 million viewers (2.20 million on E4, and 438,000 on E4+1), which made it the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Accolades= Glee was nominated in the Outstanding Comedy Series category at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards: \\"Never Been Kissed\\" was one of six episodes submitted for consideration, paired with the season's fourth episode, \\"Duets\\". Jones received an Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination for her work on Glee second season, and submitted her performance in the episode for final judging. =Critical response= Critics were polarized by the storyline about the bullying of Kurt (Chris Colfer, pictured). \\"Never Been Kissed\\" received mixed reviews from critics, who were polarized by Kurt's storyline. While CNN's Lisa Respers France thought it was Glee best episode thus far and IGN's Robert Canning rated it 9 out of 10, which signifies an outstanding episode, Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed it as \\"one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced\\", and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club deemed it a failure on \\"almost every level.\\" The Huffington Post Leah Anthony Libresco found it an \\"extraordinarily counterproductive\\" response to the string of teenage gay suicides in early 2010. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle and James Poniewozik of Time approved of the storyline in principle—the former opined that Glee willingness to raise mainstream awareness of such issues was \\"incredibly courageous\\", and the latter appreciated that it would span a multi-episode arc—but both were critical of its depiction in practice. Many elements of the plot were highlighted as being problematic. Holmes felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and \\"emotionally unsound\\". Libresco disapproved of Will for treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying which provoked it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt \\"misleading and dangerous\\", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves. VanDerWerff and Poniewozik were critical of Dalton Academy: the former found its tolerance unrealistic and the latter was disappointed that Glee declined to depict a flawed high school tackling bullying in favor of creating \\"an almost otherworldly paradise\\". Poniewozik also noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light- hearted manner, but opined that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer, \\"probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the Glee kids\\". Further praise for Colfer's performance came from Canning and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack, who approved of the episode for its depiction of there being no simple solution to the bullying. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience as much as it did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into \\"a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own.\\" MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. The Beiste storyline was met with criticism. Reiter questioned why Beiste was made to look to high school students to \\"gauge her own desirability\\", an element she found \\"hazy and creepy\\". Poniewozik criticized the depiction of Beiste as an object of pity, and felt that Will's behavior was worse than the students' when he acted with \\"amazing condescension\\" and kissed her. Both Poniewozik and Semigran disliked the way viewers were made complicit in Beiste's humiliation by being invited to laugh at her expense, and Holmes criticized Glee for denying Beiste dignity, with the observation that such a plot would never have been given to Kurt. VanDerWerff commented negatively on the way Glee plays up Beiste's \\"masculine nature\\" while simultaneously lecturing viewers against mocking her. He called the kiss \\"somehow both heartfelt and completely horrifying\\". Canning praised Jones in her \\"best performance this season\\", as well as Beiste's \\"raw and real\\" confession to Will. The Puck sub-plot received generally positive reviews. Poniewozik called it the \\"best and most authentic of the night\\", with praise for Salling's performance, and Canning felt that it served well as a comical break from the episode's other storylines. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair enjoyed the additional depth given to Puck, and he, Stack and New York Rebecca Milzoff commented positively on Puck's budding friendship with Artie. VanDerWerff deemed it the episode's \\"least objectionable\\" storyline, though wrote that the awkward inclusion of their duet, the abruptness of Artie's feelings for Brittany, and the \\"forced nature\\" of the scene in which Puck confesses that he does not want to return to juvenile detention all \\"conspired to keep the storyline from lifting off.\\" =Music and performances= The Dalton Academy Warblers performing \\"Teenage Dream\\" on the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour, led by Blaine (front right). Reviews of the episode's musical numbers were also mixed, with the mash-ups less favorably received than the other performances. Canning felt that the songs intruded on the storytelling. Hankinson wrote that the mash-ups were \\"shoehorned in [to an] already over- stuffed hour\\", and Emily Yahr of The Washington Post said they served \\"no real purpose\\". BuddyTV's Jen Harper enjoyed the harmonies and simple arrangement of \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\", and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News gave it an \\"A\\", with praise for the vocals. Stack graded it \\"B-\\". He called it a \\"nice performance\\", but incongruous in context, a concern shared by Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, who preferred Salling's rendition of \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" in the episode \\"Grilled Cheesus\\". Perry expressed approval of the cover of her song, \\"Teenage Dream\\", through the social networking website Twitter. Harper found the choreography uncomfortable viewing, and Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it agreed that the performers appeared to be \\"rockin' out a bit too much to it\\", but felt that the song worked \\"remarkably well\\" overall. Futterman deemed it the best song of the episode, and appreciated that it was more understated than numbers performed by rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline during the show's first season. Stack went further and called the performance one of his favorites on Glee; he enjoyed the choreography and arrangement and graded it \\"A+\\". Benigno again gave the song an \\"A\\"; he called it \\"flawless\\" and an improvement on Perry's original. In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition one of Glee best performances. The girls' Bon Jovi–Rolling Stones mash-up was received favorably by Stack and Milzoff—the former graded it \\"A\\", the latter called it \\"brash and fun\\", and both writers appreciated the black leather costumes. While Harper also liked the costumes and the energetic performance, she felt it \\"paled in comparison\\" to the last mash-up the girls performed, in the season one episode \\"Vitamin D\\". Futterman commented that the costumes and choreography overwhelmed the vocals, to the point of being \\"a little too Miley and not enough Glee\\". Benigno called the song a \\"cacophony\\" and gave it his lowest performance grade of the episode, a \\"D\\". He suggested that Glee had been responsible for \\"reviving the mashup fad\\", but hoped the girls' performance would serve to end it again. The boys' Supremes–En Vogue mash-up was graded \\"A\\" by Stack, who liked the combination of artists. Harper preferred the girls' costumes but felt the boys gave the better performance, while Futterman found it overly-sentimental in context, but also preferred it to the girls' song. Benigno gave it a \\"C\\", and commented, \\"Not quite the debacle the previous mash-up was, but given how fantastic this episode was, the sendoff should've been better.\\" =Chart history= All four of the cover versions featured debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and appeared on other musical charts. On the Hot 100, the show's rendition of \\"Teenage Dream\\" debuted at number eight,Peak chart positions for season 2 singles in the United States: \\"Teenage Dream\\", \\"Stop! In the Name of Love / Free Your Mind\\", \\"Start Me Up / Livin' on a Prayer\\", and \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" and sold 55,000 downloads on its first day and a total of 214,000 copies in its first week, the best first-day and first-week sales numbers for any Glee Cast single. It was the first Glee single to top Billboard Digital Songs chart, and debuted at number ten on the Canadian Hot 100. \\"Teenage Dream\\" was also the first single since the pilot's \\"Don't Stop Believin to be certified gold in the US. The other three songs on the Hot 100 were \\"Start Me Up / Livin' on a Prayer\\" at number thirty-one, which also made number twenty-two on the Canadian Hot 100; \\"Stop! In the Name of Love / Free Your Mind\\" at number thirty-eight, which also made number twenty-eight on the Canadian Hot 100; and \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" at number forty-one, which also made number thirty-two on the Canadian Hot 100.

Synonyms *Fascia Prosthesis, *Abdominal Fascia Prosthesis, *Temporary Abdominal Fascia Prosthesis, *Artificial Bur, *Bur Patch, *Abdominal Bur Closure (ABC-Patch) Trade names Wittmann Patch (Starsurgical, Inc., Burlington WI) Indications A Acute conditions * Abdominal compartment syndrome * Blunt abdominal trauma * Penetrating abdominal trauma * Traumatic and non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage * Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm * Peritonitis / intra- abdominal infections * Acute pancreatitis / infected pancreatic necrosis * Bowel ischemia B Chronic conditions * Chronic open abdomen with fistulas * Chronic open abdomen without fistulas * Large ventral hernias with fistulas * Large ventral hernias without fistulas * Failed ventral hernia repairs with meshes C Prophylactically to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome * excessive peritoneal inflammation from abdominal organ transplantation * excessive peritoneal inflammation from major abdominal operations Contraindications The patch is not intended for permanent implantation. Operative technique The original bur as used by Wittmann consists of two sheets of the same size of 40 × 20 cm: * A softer loop sheet that that covers omentum with its tissue friendly back side – loops facing outwards * A harder hook sheet on top of the loop sheet – hooks facing inwards to be pressed into the loops The softer loop sheet is sutured to the right fascia using a running looped #1 Nylon suture. The stitches are 2 cm apart and 2 cm into the fascia and 1–2 cm into the bur to permit good perfusion between stitches. The sheet with loops facing outwards is then pushed between parietal and visceral peritoneum of the other side of the incision covering abdominal content. Then the harder hook sheet is similarly sutured to the left fascia, and hooks are gently pressed into the loops of the loop sheet. Generally the hook sheet is trimmed to fit the size of the open abdomen wound. In case of the massive peritoneal hypertension both sheets cover the open space and the hook sheet does not need trimming to fit the wound opening. Clinical benefits * Use of the Wittmann Patch in patients allows for a significantly increased rate of delayed primary fascial closure after temporary abdominal closure when compared with a vacuum only closure or the use of a Bogota bag. * Use of the Wittmann Patch in combination with staged abdominal repair decreases mortality by 20% in patients with APACHE-II score of 20.

Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front (PF) won the presidential elections, defeating incumbent Rupiah Banda of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), and was sworn into office on 23 September. The PF emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly, winning 60 of the 148 seats decided on election day. Campaign Incumbent President Rupiah Banda, of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy party, ran for his first full term as president after replacing Levy Mwanawasa, who died in August 2008.Zambia: Luwingu backs Rupiah’s candidature in 2011 Lusaka Times, 23 November 2010 Michael Sata was the candidate of the Patriotic Front and Hakainde Hichilema was the candidate of the United Party for National Development. With Chinese companies investing US$2 billion by the end of 2010 in the Zambian economy, the status of Chinese business ties with Zambia, Africa's largest copper producer, grew significantly. Early in his campaign, Sata accused the Chinese mining firms of having slave-like labour conditions and ignoring safety standards and local cultural practices. He has been nicknamed \\"King Cobra\\" because of his harsh rhetoric, but he later toned down his rhetoric against the mostly Chinese foreign mining firms. Conduct Two days before the results were officially announced, the High Court banned three independent media outlets from publishing speculation on the result after The Post published a headline reading \\"Sata Heads for Victory.\\" The same day, Banda's office also said that such reports were \\"rumours\\" as no final result had been compiled. The delay in announcing the results was the cause of riots in Ndola and Kitwe, where youths fought with riot police while also burning vehicles and markets. Additionally, hackers attacked the Election Commission's website that night and posted false results suggesting Sata won by a landslide. European Union electoral observers said that the election was \\"generally well administered,\\" but that there was not equitable access to resources, resulting in the lack of a \\"level playing field\\" in the campaign. They said that state-owned media had failed to meet \\"even their minimal obligations as public service media.\\" The Zambian-based Foundation for Democratic Process criticised the holding of the election without electoral reform. It blamed the history of electoral violence and the previous failure of the losing parties to accept losing on the lack of reform.Zambia: Holding elections under current constitution is a mockery – FODEP Lusaka Times, 19 November 2010 While many called for the establishment of a 50% + 1 vote system for electing the president, the government said a new system would not be used for the election.\\"50% + 1 won’t be used in 2011\\" – Kunda] Post, Zambia, 19 November 2010 Results On 23 September, Chief Justice Ernest Sakala announced Sata the winner of the election with 1,150,045 votes, or 43%, with 95.3% of votes counted. Banda received 961,796 votes, or 36.1%, and other minor parties trailed in the poll. Sata was sworn into office later that day =President= =National Assembly= Voting did not take place in two constituencies (Magoye and Nakonde) on polling day due to deaths of candidates,Zambia General Elections, 20 September 2011: Report of the Commonwealth, Commonwealth Observer Group and the elected member for Chongwe (Japhen Mwakalombe of the MMD) resigned before taking his seat. By-elections were held for all three seats on 24 November 2011, with the PF winning two (Chongwe and Nakonde) and the UPND one (Magoye). Reactions Sata received a congratulatory telephone call from his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama. While in the 2006 election China had threatened to cut diplomatic relations with Zambia if Sata was elected, due to his criticisms of Chinese mining interests in the country, China issued a statement \\"welcoming\\" the result. Analysis Psephologists suggested that the youth vote helped anti-incumbency in a continent that rarely results in an anti-incumbent vote. They also drew parallels with the 2011 ousting of the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt. As a result of Sata's rhetoric, there were also concerns about the future investment climate in the country. Other readings said that after Sata toned down his rhetoric he did not differ much from Banda, but benefited from a crowded ballot of candidates. Psephologists also indicated that Sata did well in the urban areas, while Banda was expected to do well in the rural areas.

Neef House is a house in Denver, Colorado, United States that was built in 1886 with and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is unclear why the house was incorrectly named, as Frederick Neef's middle name was Fredolin. It was deemed historically significant for its association with early Denver businessman Frederick W. Neef and for its architecture. Frederick Neef was German and arrived in Denver in 1873. He and his brother Max owned saloons and wholesale businesses in liquor and tobacco. Together they built the Neef Brothers Brewery, reportedly one of the West's largest. Frederick bought out Max from the brewery and operated it until selling it in 1917. Fred Neef arranged to have this house built and lived with his family in it for 31 years. The NRHP nominator termed the house to be \\"a fine example of late 19th century architecture in Denver\\" and suspected that it was not locally designed, but rather was a design from an architect's pattern book, however it was not possible to find the source. Writing in 1979, the nominator went on to note that > In all events, the Neef House is a well-executed version of the popular > Queen Anne/Eastlake style, probably the finest surviving example in Denver. > It clearly demonstrates the Victorian preoccupation with complex volumes and > roof forms, and their love for elaborate detail. Of particular note is the > east facade which has a strongly sculptured aspect and, in spite of the > profusion of elements, displays a rich unified composition which is at once > pleasant and dynamic. The original craftsmanship was of a high caliber and > survives well despite an obvious lack of maintenance. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Shulz- Neef House at 1739 E. 29th St. in the Whittier neighborhood, a Denver Landmark, was purchased by Frederick at auction in 1883 and served as home for his brother Max and family.

It was built in 1895 by North Jay Grange No. 10 to replace its hall on the same site which had burned down earlier that year. Part of the building was later set aside for a Grange store. Closed in 1976, the Grange Store claimed to be the last of its type in the nation. On October 23, 1974, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The North Jay Grange Store is set at the junction of Maine State Routes 17 and 4 with Jay Hill Road, which is the main junction of the village of North Jay. The store, which faces northeast, is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with a front gable roof, clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. A single-story hip-roofed porch extends across the front. The porch is supported by metal posts with metal balustrade between. Two sets of stairs and an accessibility ramp on the left side give access to from ground level. Under the porch, the facade has a commercial store front with plate glass windows and recessed entry on the left, and a double doorway on the right, from which stairs lead to the hall above. Above the porch there are three sash windows on the second level, and two in the gable. The first floor of the building housed the store, and the second floor contains an open meeting space with stage. The third floor houses a kitchen. The North Jay Grange was organized in 1874, and its first building was built in 1889. Destroyed by fire in 1895, it was replaced by the present building the same year.

The Loire was cleared of all English and Burgundian troops. Campaign The English attack Joan of Arc's positions at the Siege of Orléans. The English under John, Duke of Bedford ordered John, Lord Talbot to besiege Orléans with his subordinates, the Earl of Suffolk and the Earl of Salisbury. The English nearly succeeded. However, Joan of Arc led a series of counterattacks. Joan, aided by Gilles de Rais, Jean de Dunois, and Jean de Brosse attacked the English siege positions. The English could not stand these attacks. Lord Talbot had to retreat and break off the siege. = The Battle of Jargeau = The English are mowed down by arrows at the Battle of Jargeau. Then, Joan and John II, Duke of Alençon marched to capture Jargeau from the Earl of Suffolk. The English had 700 troops to face 1,200 French troops. Then, a battle began with a French assault on the suburbs. English defenders left the city walls and the French fell back. Joan of Arc used her standard to begin a French rally. The English retreated to the city walls and the French lodged in the suburbs for the night. The following morning Joan of Arc called upon the defenders to surrender. They refused. The French followed with heavy artillery bombardment using primitive cannons and siege engines. One of the town's towers fell. Suffolk entered surrender nominations with a minor French captain, La Hire. This breach of protocol antagonized the French command. Joan of Arc initiated an assault on the town walls, surviving a stone projectile that split in two against her helmet as she climbed a scaling ladder. The English suffered heavy losses. Most estimates place the number at 300–400 of some 700 combatants. Suffolk became a prisoner. The French had some 1200 troops and their losses appear to have been light. Joan moved her army to Meung-sur-Loire. There, she decided to launch an assault. = The Battle of Meung-sur-Loire = Then, Joan began her attacks. English defenses at Meung- sur-Loire consisted of three components: the walled town, the fortification at the bridge, and a large walled castle just outside the town. The castle served as headquarters to the English command of John, Lord Talbot and Thomas, Lord Scales. Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alençon controlled a force that included captains Jean d'Orléans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire. Estimates of numerical strength vary with the Journal du Siège d'Orléans citing 6000 - 7000 for the French. A number that large probably counts noncombatants. The English force's numbers remain uncertain, but are lower than the French. They were led by Lord Talbot and Lord Scales. Bypassing the city and the castle, they staged a frontal assault on the bridge fortifications, conquered it in one day, and installed a garrison. This hampered English movement south of the Loire. = The Battle of Beaugency = The Castle at Beaugency still stands today. Then, Joan continued her campaign. She launched an attack on Beaugency. Joan of Arc and Duke John II of Alençon controlled a force that included captains Jean d'Orléans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire. John Talbot led the English defense. Breaking with siege warfare custom, the French army followed the 15 June capture of the bridge at Meung-sur-Loire not with an attack on that town or its castle but with an assault on neighboring Beaugency the next day. Unlike Meung-sur-Loire, the main stronghold at Beaugency was inside the city walls. It survives to the modern age and forms an imposing rectangular citadel. During the first day of fighting the English abandoned the town and retreated into the castle. The French bombarded the castle with artillery fire. That evening de Richemont and his force arrived. Hearing news of an English relief force approaching from Paris under Sir John Fastolf, d'Alençon negotiated the English surrender and granted them safe conduct out of Beaugency. The Battle of Patay followed on open territory on 18 June. = The Battle of Patay = The French and English joust into battle. In reality, the English had no horse in the battle. An English reinforcement army under Sir John Fastolf departed from Paris following the defeat at Orléans. The French had moved swiftly, capturing three bridges and accepting the English surrender at Beaugency the day before Fastolf's army arrived. The French, in the belief that they could not overcome a fully prepared English army in open battle, scoured the area in hopes of finding the English unprepared and vulnerable. The English reconnoitered with remaining defenders at Meung-sur-Loire. The French had taken only the bridge at this location, not the neighboring castle or the town. Retreating defenders from Beaugency joined them. The English excelled at open battles; they took up a position whose exact location is unknown but traditionally believed to be near the tiny village of Patay. Fastolf, John Talbot and Sir Thomas de Scales commanded the English. The standard defensive tactic of the English longbowmen was to drive pointed stakes into the ground near their positions. This prevented cavalry charges and slowed infantry long enough for the longbows to take a decisive toll on the enemy line. However, the English archers inadvertently disclosed their position to French scouts before their preparations were complete when a lone stag wandered onto a nearby field and the archers raised a hunting cry. On hearing the news of the English position, about 1,500 men under captains La Hire and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, composing the heavily armed and armoured cavalry vanguard of the French army, attacked the English. The battle swiftly turned into a rout, with every Englishman on a horse fleeing while the infantry, mostly composed of longbowmen, were cut down in droves. Longbowmen were never intended to fight armoured knights unsupported except from prepared positions where the knights could not charge them, and they were massacred. For once the French tactic of a large frontal cavalry assault had succeeded, with decisive results. Captain Jean Dagneau captured the famous general John Talbot.

Williamson, is an equation used to determine density as a function of radius, more commonly used to determine the relation between the velocities of seismic waves and the density of the Earth's interior.C. M. R. Fowler (2005). The Solid Earth: An Introduction to Global Geophysics. Cambridge University Press. pp. 333–. . Given the average density of rocks at the Earth's surface and profiles of the P-wave and S-wave speeds as function of depth, it can predict how density increases with depth.Eugene F.

It assumes that the compression is adiabatic and that the Earth is spherically symmetric, homogeneous, and in hydrostatic equilibrium. It can also be applied to spherical shells with that property. It is an important part of models of the Earth's interior such as the Preliminary reference Earth model (PREM).  History  Williamson and Adams first developed the theory in 1923. They concluded that \\"It is therefore impossible to explain the high density of the Earth on the basis of compression alone. The dense interior cannot consist of ordinary rocks compressed to a small volume; we must therefore fall back on the only reasonable alternative, namely, the presence of a heavier material, presumably some metal, which, to judge from its abundance in the Earth's crust, in meteorites and in the Sun, is probably iron.\\"  Theory  The two types of seismic body waves are compressional waves (P-waves) and shear waves (S-waves). Both have speeds that are determined by the elastic properties of the medium they travel through, in particular the bulk modulus K, the shear modulus μ, and the density ρ. In terms of these parameters, the P-wave speed vp and the S-wave speed vs are : \\\\begin{align} v_p &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{K+(4/3)\\\\mu}{\\\\rho}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ v_s &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho}}. \\\\end{align} These two speeds can be combined in a seismic parameter The definition of the bulk modulus, :K = -V\\\\frac{dP}{dV}, is equivalent to Suppose a region at a distance r from the Earth's center can be considered a fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is acted on by gravitational attraction from the part of the Earth that is below it and pressure from the part above it. Also suppose that the compression is adiabatic (so thermal expansion does not contribute to density variations). The pressure P(r) varies with r as where g(r) is the gravitational acceleration at radius r. If Equations , and are combined, we get the Adams–Williamson equation: : \\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{dr} = -\\\\frac{\\\\rho(r)g(r)}{\\\\Phi(r)}. This equation can be integrated to obtain : \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_0}\\\\right) = -\\\\int_{r_0}^r \\\\frac{g(r)}{\\\\Phi(r)}dr, where r0 is the radius at the Earth's surface and ρ0 is the density at the surface.

Built in 1884 and enlarged in the early 20th century, this modest Italianate building has been a significant social and civic center in the rural community since its construction. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Enterprise Grange hall is located near the geographic center of the rural community of Orrington, on a wedge-shaped parcel at the southeast corner of Dow Road and Center Drive. It is a tall single-story structure, three bays wide, with front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of concrete piers. A lower single-story dining room wing extends to the rear, with the kitchen in an ell extending to the south. The main facade faces west, and is symmetrically composed, with a center entrance sheltered by a hood with ornate Italianate brackets. Sash windows flank the entrance in the side bays, and in the gable able, with bracketed cornices above them. The side walls of the main block have similarly-styled windows. The Enterprise Grange (Patrons of Husbandry) was organized in Orrington, a community then dominated by agriculture, in 1875, and purchased land for a building two years later, and the main hall was built in 1884 by the Grange membership with locally milled lumber. The group struggled financially in its early years, but had by the early 20th century reached a better financial footing, at which time the dining room and kitchen were added. The building was electrified in 1934, a heating system add in 1951, and its kitchen updated in 1961. The building's auditorium and stage have served not just as a meeting point for the Grange's activities, but have also served since construction as a major social venue for the town, hosting weddings, suppers, church services, and other social events. In the 1920s its stage was relocated to better accommodate theatrical performances.

The present living room and the downstairs bedroom each contain handsome Georgian mantle-pieces. The Van Wyck House, according to the article \\"History of Van Wyck House Outlined for Museum Group,\\" is described very uniquely. Mrs. C. Turner Richardson described the history and significance of this house to 60 members of the Museums Group of the Women's Club of Douglaston during a meeting in the same house in 1950. By 1770, the house had expanded to add more rooms, and in 1930 the house expanded again to include room for a new kitchen. The House is a 2-story structure with five bedrooms and a bath on the first- floor, and three bedrooms and two baths on the second-floor. The notable architectural features of the house include its salt-box roof, oak beams, and wooden shingles. It is one of the last remaining Dutch Colonial houses in New York City.

It was officially called \\"Convención Especial de Reclamaciones\\" (), for losses sustained by US citizens or companies by the Mexican Revolution.Fechas Históricas de México, por FERNANDO OROZCO LINARES, PANORAMA EDITORIAL, S. A., 1992. Available on Wikisource. The treaty sought to channel the demands of US citizens for alleged damage to their property caused by internal wars of the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1921. The meetings were held in Mexico City and were conducted in a building owned by the federal government of Mexico at 85 Bucareli Street, hence the treaty's nickname. Negotiations began on May 15, 1923 and ended on August 13. The treaty was signed by Mexican President Álvaro Obregón, primarily to obtain diplomatic recognition from the US government, led by President Warren G. Harding, but were never formally approved by the Congresses of both countries. The Bucareli Treaty was canceled shortly afterward by Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles.KRAUZE, Enrique: \\"Plutarco Elías Calles, reformar desde el origen\\", en la serie \\"Biografía del Poder\\", México, Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1987.  Background  Mexican President Álvaro Obregón (December 1, 1920 – November 30, 1924) The situation in Mexico was marked by political instability and constant military revolts. Part of the relative weakness of Álvaro Obregón's government came from the fact that the US had not recognized the postrevolutionary regime.Howard F. Cline, The United States and Mexico. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1961, p. 204. The Constitution of 1917, with a strong socialist and nationalist influence, had hurt many US interests which made US President Warren G. Harding refuse to recognize Obregón as the legitimate president. The US also demanded the repeal of several articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 or at least the exemption for the US. For Obregón, US recognition of his government was a priority to avoid the constant threat of war. Barely nine years earlier, the US had occupied Veracruz. Also, recognition would weaken his internal enemies, who also sought US support. The devastation and the disorder caused by the Mexican Revolution made Obregón consider foreign direct investment to be necessary to rebuild the Mexican economy, but the US conditioned the recognition of Obregon, with a treaty in which Mexico would guarantee the rights of property of US citizens living in Mexico and US oil companies operating in Mexico. The oil problem stemmed from Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution, which stated that Mexico is in direct control of everything on Mexican soil. That affected possession and extraction of oil by US and European oil companies. The low-profile negotiations that led to the treaty took place from May to August 1923 in a venue on Bucareli Street in Mexico City. These conditions were demanded by the US to the Mexican government: * The content of Article 27 of the Constitution to specify the legal situation of oil industry and agricultural properties of foreigners. * The payment of the external debt, suspended during the government of Mexican President Venustiano Carranza, to be resumed. * Compensation to be paid to foreigners for damages to their persons or property during the revolutionary struggle. The Mexican Supreme Court of Justice granted and determined that Article 27 would not be retroactive for the oil industry. As for the resumption of external debt payments, Obregón tried to obtain funds by new taxes on oil, but the oil companies opposed to the increase, stopped production, and forced the government to repeal the tax.  Agreement  The Bucareli Treaty was signed by Álvaro Obregón on August 13, 1923 reached an agreement with these terms:Memorias de Adolfo de la Huerta * The agricultural properties expropriated from the US would be paid with bonds for those no more than 1755 hectares. * For properties that exceeded that size, the payment would be immediate and in cash. * A commission would be created and responsible for reviewing pending claims from 1868, but claims arising out of the revolution would be solved separately. * Regarding oil, Article 27 was not retroactive to US citizens who had acquired their leases before 1917, which allowed them to continue exploiting the oil freely. US President Warren G. Harding (March 4, 1921 – August 2, 1923) Claims had to be met for a period of two years and processed within five years from the signing of the treaty. However, the treaty lacked legal validity because it was not approved by the Congresses of both signatory countries. It was in a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" that bound only Obregón but not his successors. However, his government was recognized by the US. The amount of money paid to Americans under Obregon is still unknown. The former interim president Adolfo de la Huerta, who was in Obregon's cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, asserted that the treaty violated the national sovereignty and subjected Mexico to humiliating conditions. De la Huerta accused Obregón of treason against the nation but was accused of incompetence in the performance of his duties and was made responsible for Mexico's financial plight. De la Huerta resigned and moved to Veracruz, where he launched a manifesto that set off the Rebelión Delahuertista in December 1923. A common myth in Mexico is that the treaty forbade Mexico to produce specialized machinery (engines, aircraft, etc.) and so Mexico would have delayed for many years its economic development. It has been argued that from 1910 to 1930, civil wars, military coups, and rebellions devastated the industries in Mexico and stopped higher education, research, and technological development, and the social and political instability drove off the foreign investments.ROSAS, Alejandro: \\"Mitos de la historia mexicana. De Hidalgo a Zedillo\\", México, Editorial Planeta, 2006. The revolution did not actually destroy the industrial sector, factories, extractive facilities, or industrial entrepreneurs and so once the fighting ended in 1917, production resumed.Stephen Haber, \\"Assessing the Obstacles to Industrialization: the Mexican Economy, 1830-1940,\\" Journal of Latin American Studies vol 24, No. 1 (Feb. 1992) p. 27 The full text of the Bucareli Treaty, published after it was signed, shows the absence of prohibitions on technology.  Cancelation  Plutarco Elías Calles, President of México (December 1, 1924 - November 30, 1928). When Plutarco Elías Calles took office on December 1, 1924, one of the main points of contention between the US and Mexico still was oil. Calles quickly rejected the Bucareli Treaty and began drafting a new oil law that strictly fulfilled the Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution. The US government's reaction was immediate. The US ambassador in México, James Rockwell Sheffield called Calles a \\"communist,\\" and the US Secretary of State, Frank Billings Kellogg, issued a threat against Mexico on June 12, 1925. US public opinion turned against Mexico after the first embassy of the Soviet Union in the world opened in México. Also, the Soviet ambassador said that no country in the world had more similarities to the Soviet Union and México. Then, members of the UD government considered to Mexico was the second Bolshevik country on earth and they began to call it \\"Soviet Mexico.\\"RICHARDS, Michael D. Revolutions in World History p. 30 (2004 Routledge) The debate on the new oil law was in 1925, with US interests opposed to any initiative. On 1926, the new law was enacted. On January 1927, the Calles government canceled permits to oil companies that did not meet the law. México managed to avoid war by a series of diplomatic maneuvers. Soon, a direct telephone hotline was established between Calles and US President Calvin Coolidge. Also, Sheffield was replaced by Dwight Morrow. On March 18, 1938, after a series of contempt for foreign oil companies, Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas del Río decreed the Mexican oil expropriation, creating PEMEX.

Built as worker housing for a granite quarry, it was moved in 1909 to its present local for use by the local Grange chapter. It continues to be used by that organization as a community resource. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Pleasant River Grange is located in a rural area near the center of Vinalhaven island. The island is nearly divided by the Pleasant River, a north-flowing stream the exits into Vinal Cove; the grange hall is located on the east side of the river near its mouth, on the north side of Round Island Road, east of its junction with North Haven Road. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The facade facing southeast toward the road is symmetrical, with two sash windows on each floor, and one in the gable. The main entrance is on the longer southwest facade, near the southern corner and under a shed-roof porch. The interior has a hallway extending across the front, with a dining room and kitchen in the rear of the first floor, and open auditorium on the second floor. The walls and ceilings are finished in tongue-and-groove maple. The grange hall was originally a workers boarding house built by A.M. Webster for workers at his nearby granite quarry, and was located on the west side of the Pleasant River. The local Grange chapter was organized in 1908, and Webster (who had recently closed the quarry) donated the building to the new organization. During the winter of 1908-09, it was hauled across the frozen Pleasant River to its present location. Alterations to the interior for its new function lasted another three years, with the hall periodically used for dances and other fundraising activities. The Grange continues to be a significant community organization on the island.

Kastner left to form the Doughboys and later, All Systems Go!.  History  The Asexuals formed in 1983 when Sean Friesen, T.J.Collins and Paul Remington, all Beaconsfield High students, decided to start a punk rock band. Another Beaconsfield native, future actor Al Goulem, was in the band as second guitarist for a few months with Collins singing. Their friend John Kastner quickly joined and became the singer. After briefly using the names \\"Commonwealth\\", \\"Dead Dog\\", \\"Johnny Jew and the Holocaust\\" and \\"VD Teens\\", they finally chose the name \\"Asexuals\\" because none of the band members had girlfriends at the time. Their music mixed elements of hardcore as well as more melodic punk rock à la The Nils or Hüsker Dü. The band played gigs in Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston and Toronto, opening for touring Canadian and American punk bands before releasing their first EP, Featuring: The Asexuals on Og Music in 1984. The same year, the band contributed a song to the legendary Montreal punk compilation Primitive Air-Raid on Psyche Industry Records, then released their first LP Be What You Want on First Strike Records in December 1984. By the following year, Psyche Industry Records had received much positive feedback about the Asexuals's song, \\"Contra-rebels\\", (the opening track from the Primitive Air-Raid compilation), so they happily re- released the band's Be What You Want LP after First Strike Records refused to do so, having stopped answering the band's letters and phone calls. Also in 1985, Psyche Industry released the Asexuals' second LP, Contemporary World, which featured a hardcore treatment of Bob Dylan's classic song, \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\", and generally flirted with a more alternative rock sound.The Gazette, Montreal (May 1, 1986), P. C-15 Record Roundup: Give Laurie Anderson another round The band went on a two-month, 69-date tour across the U.S.A. and Canada to promote that album.The Gazette, Montreal (May 8, 1986), P. G-12 West Island bar business booms with live bands In 1987, Kastner clashed with the other members about the band's evolving musical direction, and was kicked out because he was taking too much space. Kastner went on to form the Doughboys, while the Asexuals reconfigured themselves, with Collins and Freisen both playing electric guitar and sharing lead-vocal duties, and bringing in then-Jerry Jerry and the Sons of Rhythm Orchestra bassist Blake Cheetah (now better known as Bangkok-based writer Jim Algie) to take over bass guitar from Collins. They toured across North America relentlessly, opening for fellow Canadian punk bands like D.O.A.. and SNFU, as well as such American hardcore greats as Hüsker Dü, the Minutemen, the Dicks and Youth Brigade. In 1988, the band released their third full-length LP, Dish, on Cargo Records.The Gazette, Montreal (September 14, 1989), P. C-10 Underground band surfaces with risky, passionate album Under the direction of Producer Steve Kravac, Dish was an artistic and sonic departure from their previous recordings, not only because of the noticeable absence of Kastner's distinctly sneering vocals; but with a more college-radio friendly sound. For the first time, the band departed from the standard arrangement of distorted electric guitars, bass, and drums. Indeed, the self-titled opening track featured acoustic guitars and horns. While this less brash sound alienated many long-time fans, the songs generally remained punchy and hard-rocking, and the band retained a tougher sound when performing live. They were on the verge of disbanding when a German promoter offered them to tour Europe. Cheetah quit the band after this tour and was replaced by Dom Pompeo (1964-2012), with whom they recorded their fourth LP (also on CD, unlike previous recordings), Exile from Floontown. Released in 1991, the album went a long way towards restoring the band's original distorted electric guitar sound, while remaining melodic and college- radio friendly. In 1992, they released the Walt's Wish EP on Cargo.The Gazette, Montreal (December 21, 1991), P. E-5 Album shows Asexuals serious about musical fun Dom Pompeo quit in 1993, being replaced by Yuri Mohacsi and that line-up released an EP, Love Goes Plaid on RPN-Records in Europe and Boss Tuneage in America. In 1996, they recorded and released what would be their last studio album, Fitzjoy, on Hypnotic Records. They were supposed to tour supporting that album but instead disbanded. Friesen eventually moved to Austin and started La Motta with Inland Empire's bass player Alfred Mueller and drummer Wal Rashidi in the beginning of the 2000s (decade) and released three albums and toured Europe and the U.S.A. In 2001, Boss Tuneage released Greater than Later, a compilation of many old Asexuals tracks spanning years 1984 to 1996 as well as some unreleased tracks. The original line-up of the band, including Kastner (who lives in Los Angeles now) and Friesen (who lives in Texas), got back together to play a reunion show on October 1, 2010 in Montreal along with fellow Montreal punk bands the 222's, and Hollerado. The band reunited again in Toronto the following March to play back-to-back shows at the Bovine Sex Club.http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=179411/ NOW magazine, \\"This week's must-see Toronto shows\\"  Controversy about \\"Contra-Rebels\\"  The Asexuals were reviled in many punk fanzines, including Maximumrocknroll, in 1984 because of the song \\"Contra-Rebels\\" that was featured on Primitive Air-Raid and Be What You Want. The song was a little ambiguous in interpretation, using irony with the lyrics \\"Contra-rebels, trained by the CIA, Contra-rebels, will blow your Reds away\\". Tim Yohannon of MRR didn't get the irony at first, calling the band mouthpieces of the new right before apologizing a few months after.

Members use the postnominal letters SND. The congregation was founded in Coesfeld, Germany, during a time of religious and social need. In 1849, Hilligonde Wolbring and Elisabeth Kuhling took in orphaned and neglected children, and educated and cared for them. Wolbring and Kuling established the Sisters of Notre Dame of Coesfeld to continue their work. During Kulturkampf, the sisters were forced to leave Coesfeld, and traveled to the U.S. where they taught in parishes in Ohio and Kentucky and, eventually, in many other locations. Sr. Kristin Battles SND is the current superior general of the congregation History Hilligonde Wolbring was born in 1828 in the Netherlands and Elisabeth Kuling was born in 1822 in Munster, Germany. They both attended the Royal Teacher Training Seminar for Women in Munster and began teaching at St. Lambert Parish in Coesfeld, Westphalia. While teaching at St. Lambert, Wolbring and Kuling taking in orphaned and neglected children, and realized that they wanted to continue that work with more children. Initially, the two teachers moved into a house with seven girls. Hilligonde, who was orphaned at an early age, used her entire inheritance to fund their endeavor. The parish priest at St. Lambert, Father Theodore Elting, suggested that Wolbring and Kuling establish a religious congregation which would give them a more solid financial economic basis. Three sisters of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur traveled from Amersfoort, Netherlands, to instruct Wolbring and Kuhling, based on their congregation which was founded by St. Julie Billiart in 1804. Wolbring (Sister Maria Aloysia) and Kuling (Sister Maria Ignatia) formally established the Sisters of Notre Dame of Coesfeld on 1 October 1850, and Father Elting acquired an abandoned former convent, St. Annathal, to serve as the first motherhouse. in 1855, the Sisters of Notre Dame of Coesfeld became an independent congregation and, on 5 October 1856, Mother Maria Anna, from Munster, Germany, was elected the first superior general. In 1871, a set of policies called Kulturkampf was established in the Kingdom of Prussia under Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck. Kulturkampf was an attempt to secularize the state and reduce the influence of religion. By 1875, rules were enacted forbidding religious congregation from teaching in school, and all religious foundations were given six months to leave the country. In 1874, Bishop Richard Gilmour invited Mother Maria Chrystoma (superior general from 1872–1895) to send six sisters to Cleveland, Ohio to teach in the parish. She accepted, and on June 1874, Mother Maria Chrystoma, sister Maria Aloysia, and six other sisters boarded a ship in Bremen, Germany and sailed for the U.S. Two months later, the sisters began teaching in Cleveland and Covington, Kentucky. In the next four years about 200 sisters came to the U.S. to teach. Eventually, three provinces were established in Covington, Toledo, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California. In 1947, the motherhouse was established in Rome, Italy. Sister Maria Aloysia, who had been part of the first group to travel to the U.S., died in 1889 and was buried in St Joseph Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio. Sister Maria Ignatia died in 1869 from cancer. In the 21st century, the Sisters of Notre Dame have provinces all over the world and, in 2008, a province was re-established in Coesfeld.

(“letter of Alfonso, king of Spain in the year 906”) is a letter purportedly written by Alfonso III of Asturias to the clergy of the cathedral of Saint Martin's at Tours in 906. The letter is primarily about the king of Asturias purchasing a crown kept in the treasury of the church of Tours, but it also includes instructions for visiting the shrine of James, son of Zebedee, which lay in Alfonso's kingdom. An exchange of literature was also arranged in the letter. Alfonso requested a written account of the posthumous miracles worked by Saint Martin. In return the church of Tours would receive the Vitas sanctorum patrum Emeritensium, a hagiography of some early Bishops of Mérida. The authenticity of the letter is widely questioned and \\"it has generally been regarded with scepticism by modern historical scholarship\\".Richard A. Fletcher, Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelmírez of Santiago de Compostela (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 71.

Carl Erdmann,Erdmann, Forschungen zur politischen Ideenwelt des Frühmittelalters, F. Baethgen, ed. (Berlin: 1951), 31–33, cited in Fletcher 1984, 323. and Richard Fletcher.Appendix C, pp. 317–23, in Fletcher 1984 is devoted to demonstrating the authenticity of the letter. Palaeography and diplomatic The letter was copied into a cartulary of Tours compiled between 1132 and 1137, but which was destroyed in 1793. A copy was made for the 17th-century antiquary André Duchesne, and this is the copy from which all modern editions derive.Fletcher 1984, 317–18. Since no earlier copy survives, it is impossible to ascertain at which stage of transmission the corruptions in the present manuscript were introduced. No correspondence of the kings of Asturias, Castile or Kingdom of León has survived from before the 12th century save this letter, if authentic. For all these reasons neither the science of palaeography nor that of diplomatic can solve the problem of authenticity. If a forgery, the letter must pre-date the 1130s, when the cartulary of Tours was compiled.Fletcher, 1984, 322. In his surviving charters Alfonso almost invariably calls himself simply \\"King Alfonso\\" (Adefonsus rex), but in the letter he uses the elaborate and higher- sounding style \\"Alfonso by the power and nod of Christ king of Spain\\" (Adefonsus pro Christi nutu at que potentia Hispaniae rex). This not entirely unique, however, as a similarly grandiose title is given to Alfonso in the contemporary Chronica Prophetica (883): \\"glorious Alfonso in all the Spains to reign\\" (gloriosus Adefonsus in omni Spanie regnaturus).Fletcher 1984, 319, citing the Crónica Profética in M. Gómez Moreno (ed.), \\"Las primeras crónicas de la Reconquista: el ciclo de Alfonso III\\", Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia, 100 (1932): 562–628, at 623. Contents The letter purports to be a response to a letter the king received from the clergy of Tours asking him if he would like to purchase an \\"imperial crown (corona imperialis) made of gold and precious stones, fitting to his dignity\\" kept at their church. This letter (literas) may not have been the first of its kind from Tours, for Alfonso refers in his response to their mentioning the crown \\"again\\" (rursum). It was delivered to the king by Sisnando, the bishop of Iria Flavia, who had received it from Mansio and Datus, two envoys of Tours, who had encouraged the bishop to persuade the king to buy. In this passage Sisnando is anachronistically titled archbishop, centuries before the see of Iria Flavia was raised to that dignity in 1120, under Diego Gelmírez. If the letter was copied after 1120, the error may be a \\"correction\\", intentional or not, to reflect the later status of Iria Flavia. It has also been suggested that the title archiepiscopus is an expansion of æpiscopus (bishop), a spelling known from contemporary Spanish documents, but of which a scribe working at Tours may have been ignorant and assumed the diphthong æ represented an abbreviation of archie-. This variant spelling of episcopus is encountered in an original Asturian royal charter of 7 March 918.Fletcher 1984, 319, citing Lucien Barrau-Dihigo, \\"Chartes royales léonaises, 912–1037\\", Révue Hispanique 10 (1903), 350–454, no. ii. Alfonso accepted the offer and promised to arrange a \\"journey by sea\\" (navalis remigatio) for May 906 (that same year) to make the exchange. The year of 906 is given in the anno Domini (AD) system of dating, rather than that of the Spanish era, then more prevalent in Spain. This is probable to be explained by the unfamiliarity of the recipients of the letter with his latter system of dating. While the anno Domini system was known in Asturias—and was used in a document recording the consecration of a new cathedral at Iria Flavia in 899—the Spanish era was hardly known outside of Spain, and even the Venerable Bede, \\"greatest computist of the early middle ages\\", was ignorant of it.Fletcher 1984, 320. It was planned to send members of the royal household to Bordeaux, where Alfonso apparently had connexions with the local magnate, Amalvinus, called \\"our friend\\" in the letter and titled both duke and count of Bordeaux. The obscure figure of Amalvinus, otherwise only known from a document of 887, lends credence to the letter. Alfonso requested that the clergy send the crown to Bordeaux by mid-May and that two or three men of Tours accompany his men back to Spain.Fletcher 198, 318: \\"He tactfully intimates that the church of Tours will be well rewarded\\". The reason for Alfonso's request for a work about Saint Martin's posthumous miracles—that he then only possessed an account of Martin's miracles performed while alive—can be partly verified, for Alfonso left his library to the church of San Salvador de Oviedo in 908, and the list of books drawn up at the time includes the life of Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus, \\"the most famous piece of hagiography in western Christendom\\".Fletcher 1984, 323. The work that he offered Tours in exchange was not found widely within Spain and not at all outside it, a state of affairs suspected by Alfonso himself. Its first editor and translator, J. N. Garvin, could find no mention of this work from the Middle Ages outside of Alfonso's disputed letter. The letter from Tours apparently informed Alfonso of the Viking attack of 903 in the course of which Saint Martin's, and large swathes of the city, were burnt. The rebuilding began immediately under Archbishop Hebemus. Alfonso in his response rejoices that the restoration of the church is going ahead, and that new miracles have been reported at the saint's shrine, which probably inspired his request for an updated vita of Saint Martin.

Painted early in his career, it shows how the artist was attracted to animal subjects in this period.Rhoda Eitel (Pierpont Morgan Library), From Leonardo to Pollock: master drawings from the Morgan Library, Pierpont Morgan Library, 2006. The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1831, and archives of Delacroix's will executor, Achille Piron, revealed that the painter had paid 1,200 francs to insure it. It belonged to M. Maurice Cottier and now is on display at Room 77 of Louvre in Paris. Influence and analysis Sweetly, the young background tiger slopes in his mother in the foreground, both running into rocks and under a cloudy sky. Some authors have written that Delacroix's animals paintings were made using his pet cat as a model.Mike Venezia, Getting to know the world's greatest artists – Eugène Delacroix, Children's Press, 2003, p.27. And although it seems that the painting inspiration is due to one of his visits to the Jardin des Plantes zoo to see the tigers play with his friend Antoine-Louis Barye (an animal sculptor), Delaroix was always more content to observe his own cat.Gilles Néret, Eugène Delacroix, 1798–1863: the prince of romanticism, Taschen, 2000, p. 64. The piece was in some way influenced by Rubens and is very opposite of Delacroix's violent Tiger Hunt, both (and others Delacroix painting in this subject) capturing the ferocity and tenderness that these animals are capable of. Delacroix could paint two different works that shows a discrepancy of the tigers behavior. In fact, tiger cubs play in their first years of life because it prepares them for hunting, stalking, climbing and fighting in the grown phase.Sea World. Tigers – Birth and care of young . Consulted on 28 September 2010. Tigers and great cats are frequent motifs in Eugène's works (see the following section). These paintings, along with A Young Tiger Playing with its Mother, can be interpreted as a form of the artist displaying human emotions and passions personified as tame and fierce animals. For example, Delacroix wrote in his Journal of the time: \\"Men are tigers and wolves driven to destroy one another\\".Néret, 2000, p.64. Les hommes sont des tigres et des loups animés les uns contre les autres pour s'entre-détruire. His friend Théophile Gautier saw a resemblance between him and manner and those of these great cats that he painted, writing: \\"His tawny eyes, with their feline expression, his slender lips stretched tight over magnificent teeth, his firm jaw line emphasised by strong cheekbones... gave his features an untamed, a strange, exotic, almost alarming beauty.\\" In French, the picture is called Jeune tigre jouant avec sa mère. Its fierce but also divinely animals represents the \\"delight in wildness\\" that Romantic artists like Delacroix was fascinated with.Matt Cartmill, A View to a Death in the Morning: Hunting and Nature Through History, Harvard University Press, 1996, p.118-19. (His interest in wildlife reaches its peak with Ovid among the Scythians (1859) — where there's no feline, but barbarians people.) The painting of the mother and son tigers had a significant history to painter's works and to the time, as Lee Johnson wrote about it: Other paintings with similar theme Image:Eugène Delacroix - Tigre.jpg|Tiger, 36 × 53 cm Image:Delacroix - Tiger and Snake.jpg|Tiger and Snake.

It was established as the ISEE Russian Chapter in 1992.  History  Russian Society for Ecological Economics (RSEE) has started its activities in 1989 in Irkutsk based on the Irkutsk Computing Center, Russian Academy of Sciences, as an independent informal group of academic researchers, focusing mainly on ecological-economic modeling of regional development. Several research projects were implemented for the Lake Baikal region in late 80x and early 90x. Two National Conferences were held (1989, 1991) near Irkutsk, Russia, and several publications appeared on ecologically sustainable economic development of Baikal region. In August 1992, at the Stockholm Meeting of the International Society for Ecological Economics, a discussion between Robert Costanza (ISEE President at that time), Paul Safonov, and Renat Perelet (both from Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow) took place and the plans for joint activities were drawn. The By-Laws of the Russian regional chapter of ISEE were drafted, and they were adopted by the ISEE Board of Directors in the beginning of 1993. Finally, through a publication in the ISEE Newsletter (Ecological Economic Bulletin) in April 1993, the Russian Society for Ecological Economics had obtained the status as the ISEE Russian Chapter (ISEE/RC), and became a member of the international community of ecological economists, and the first Regional Society (Chapter) of the ISEE. The founding ISEE/RC officers were: * President: Prof. Vladimir I. Gurman, Program Systems Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences (Pereslavl- Zalessky) * Vice-President: Dr. Renat A. Perelet, Institute for Systems Analysis, Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow) * Executive Director: Dr. Paul I. Safonov, Institute of Control Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow) * Secretary-Treasurer: Dr. Tatyana V. Chemezova, Irkutsk State University (Irkutsk). Also the Russian Regional Council for Ecological Economics was created, as a consultative body of the RSEE, aimed at independent assessment and advisory support for activities in the field of ecological economics in Russia and cooperation with other states of the NIS. The members of the first Council included Prof. Victor I. Danilov-Danilian, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of Russia, Academician Prof. Nikita N. Moiseev, Russian Academy of Sciences, a Member of the President's Advisory Council, Prof. Ivery V. Prangishvily, Director of the Institute of Control Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, and many other prominent Russian scientists. The Secretariat of the Russian Chapter was established at the Institute of Control Sciences (ICS), Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), Moscow. Several local centers have been created in many regions of Russia (Pereslavl-Zalessky, Irkutsk, Rostov-on-Don, Tyumen, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Novgorod, Saratov, St. Petersburg, and other), and also in Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan.  Conferences, Events, Projects  The First International Conference of ISEE/RC took place in Moscow and Pereslavl- Zalessky (1993). In his greeting to the Conference the Russian Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Prof. Victor Danilov-Danilian has emphasized the role the Russian Society for Ecological Economics and its cooperation with ISEE for the broadest understanding in the society of the major principles and strategies of the rational economic usage of Russian natural resources. The establishment of science/techno-parks and natural parks in different regions of Russia was encouraged by the minister who considered them important sources of new, environmentally sound and sustainable socio-economic systems based on ecological economic principles, monitoring of the natural environment and socio-economic processes. Academician Nikita Moiseev gave an opening plenary presentation about Noosphere, a theory of famous Russian Scientist Vladimir Vernadsky, which in may aspects had anticipated the ideas of Ecological Economics. Professor Ann-Mari Jansson (Stockholm University), former ISEE Vice-President, had discussed the emergence of the ecological economics paradigm at her invited plenary talk at this Conference and has welcomed participants to join activities of the ISEE. This conference was followed in August 1993 by an expedition to Lake Baikal and its basin, aimed at attracting the attention of the international community to the urgency of solving ecological and economic problems of this region which is a unique natural system of world significance. Since then, ISEE/RC (now RSEE) holds International Conferences every odd year: * ISEE/RC 1993, Moscow and Pereslavl-Zalessky, followed by ecological expedition to Lake Baikal * ISEE/RC 1995, Pereslavl-Zalessky * ISEE/RC 1997, Novgorod * ISEE/RC 1999, Saratov * RSEE 2001, Moscow * RSEE 2003, Lake Baikal * RSEE 2005, St. Petersburg * RSEE 2007, Sochi * RSEE 2009, Curonian Spit on Baltic Sea * RSEE 2011, Kemerovo. * RSEE 2013 is planned to be held in Irkutsk, and Lake Baikal. In 1994 ISEE/RC undertook a joint project with ISEE (supported by Charles Mott Foundation, Flint, Michigan) to translate four books in the field of ecological economics from English into Russian.  Structure and Administration  In November 1997, upon the decision of the ISEE/RC Business meeting at the Third biannual conference in Novgorod (July 1997), first elections of ISEE/RC officers were held and the new officers were elected. In May 2001 the Administrative Board of the ISEE/RC adopted a decision about future development of the ISEE Russian Chapter more broadly as the Russian Society for Ecological Economics (RSEE). The new RSEE Constitution and By-Laws were developed to reflect the changes in the Russian and the International Societies for Ecological Economics. At Fifth ISEE/RC Conference in Moscow in September 2001 an organisational meeting was held concerning this transition, and in February 2002 the new Administrative Board was elected for the period of 2002-2003, and since then elections are being held bi-annually.

Essential Neurology (4th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. p. 1184 . This commonly results from weakness of some of the ulnar nerve innervated intrinsic hand muscles -in particular the palmar interosseous muscle to the little finger- caused by damage to their nerve supply (denervation). There may be different causes for this denervation and muscle imbalance including: * An ulnar nerve neuropathy usually from ulnar nerve entrapment somewhere along its course (most commonly around the cubital tunnel at the elbow where the nerve is exposed to tension, friction and compression). This muscle imbalance between the (intact) radial nerve innervated extensor digiti quinti and the (weak) ulnar innervated interossei in the context of ulnar neuropathy is what Wartenberg described. * Cervical myelopathy most commonly due to mechanical compression of the spinal cord in the neck as occurs in spondylotic cervical spinal stenosis but also seen in other spinal cord disease including post-traumatic tetraplegia. This finding of weak finger adduction in cervical myelopathy is also called the \\"finger escape sign\\". * Upper motor neuron disorders of the cerebral cortex such as mild hemiplegic stroke or hemiplegic migraine where the same clinical finding has been called the \\"digiti quinti sign\\" Differentiation of the cause of Wartenberg's sign is based on associated clinical findings in the history and examination and sometimes involves investigations including radiographs and/or MRI of the cervical spine, elbow/wrist/hand and/or nerve conduction studies and EMG. Wartenberg's sign is not a feature of, and should not be confused with, Wartenberg's syndrome. The later involves compression at the wrist of the superficial sensory branch of the radial nerve which does not innervate hand muscles.

Set primarily in Old Delhi, the story describes the tensions in a post-partition Indian family, starting with the characters as adults and moving back into their lives throughout the course of the novel. While the primary theme is the importance of family, other predominant themes include the importance of forgiveness, the power of childhood, and the status of women, particularly their role as mothers and caretakers, in modern-day India.Desai, Anita. Clear Light of Day. 1st Mariner books ed. New York: Mariner Books, 2000. Print. Plot summary The novel is split into four sections covering the Das family from the children's perspective in this order: adulthood, adolescence and early adulthood, childhood, and a final return to an adult perspective in the final chapter. The story centers on the Das family, who have grown apart with adulthood. It starts with Tara, whose husband Bakul is India's ambassador to the US, greeting her sister Bimla (Bim), who lives in the family's Old Delhi home, teaching history and taking care of their autistic brother Baba. Their conversation eventually comes to Raja, their brother who lives in Hyderabad. Bim, not wanting to go to the wedding of Raja's daughter, shows Tara an old letter from when Raja became her landlord, in which he unintentionally insulted her after the death of his father-in-law, the previous landlord. The section closes with the two sisters visiting the neighbors, the Misras.Desai pp. 1–43 In part two of the novel, the setting switches to partition-era India, when the characters are adolescents in the house. Raja is severely ill with tuberculosis and is left to Bim's ministrations. Aunt Mira (\\"Mira-masi\\"), their supposed caretaker after the death of the children's often absent parents, dies of alcoholism. Earlier, Raja's fascination with Urdu attracts the attention of the family's Muslim landlord, Hyder Ali, whom Raja idolizes. After recovering from TB, Raja follows Hyder Ali to Hyderabad. Tara escapes from the situation through marriage to Bakul, leaving Bim to provide for Baba alone, in the midst of the partition and the death of Gandhi.Desai pp. 44–101 In part three Bim, Raja and Tara are depicted awaiting the birth of their brother Baba in pre-partition India. Aunt Mira, widowed by her husband and mistreated by her in-laws, is brought in to help with Baba, who is autistic, and to raise the children. Raja is fascinated with poetry. He shares a close bond with Bim, the head girl at school, although they often exclude Tara. Tara wants to be a mother, although this fact brings ridicule from Raja and Bim, who want to be heroes.Desai pp. 102–141 The final section returns to modern India and shows Tara confronting Bim over Raja's daughter's wedding and Bim's broken relationship with Raja. This climaxes when Bim explodes at Baba. After her anger fades, she decides that family love is irreplaceable and can cover all wrongs. After Tara leaves, she goes to her neighbors the Misras for a concert, where she is touched by the unbreakable relationship they seem to have. She tells Tara to come back from the wedding with Raja and forgives him.Desai pp. 142–183 Background Desai considers Clear Light of Day her most autobiographical work as it is set during her own coming of age and also in the same neighbourhood in which she grew up.\\"Notes on the Biography of Anita Desai\\" . Elizabeth Ostberg. 12 February 2000. Haverford.edu. Retrieved 2012-06-21.

Web. 26 Sept. 2010. Historical setting =Partition= The book is set at various times around the partition in Old Delhi. The tension between Muslims and Hindus are clearly shown by the father's refusal to allow Raja to go to a Muslim university and study Urdu literature because he has cause to fear for his safety. The book also mentions the partition riots as well as the refugee camps. It also depicts the flight of the Alis, the Das's Muslim landlords and neighbors. These tensions often escalated into riots, but not in Old Delhi. The Hindus' claim to India led to the neglect, abuse and often violence towards Muslims in India or Hindus in Pakistan. The nation of India was torn apart in a violent manner, leaving refugees on both side of the border and mutual anger and hostility. The suspicious nature of the partition is also evidenced in the plainclothes police who felt Raja could be a Pakistani spy.Census of India, 1941 and 1951.Ansari, Sarah. 2005. Life after Partition: Migration, Community and Strife in Sindh: 1947—1962. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. 256 pages. [.]Desai pg. 45–46, 50–53, 59, 71–72, 75, 85, 101 =Delhi= In the book, Old Delhi is frequently referred to as old, stagnant, or decaying. Old Delhi is overcrowded and generally overlooked in favor of New Delhi. New Delhi is considered vibrant, modern and alive. In the book New Delhi is where the characters, specifically Bakul, go to avoid the soporific effects of Old Delhi or even to be connected with the outside world. Bim is in New Delhi when she hears of Gandhi death, and Raja finds diversion and entertainment as a teenager in New Delhi.Desai pg. 4–5, 17–19 =Religious= The religious undercurrents in the book manifest themselves in two ways: the partition (see above), and Raja's relationship with the Alis. As a young adult he found acceptance (albeit not inclusion) in Hyder Ali's nightly gatherings. His fascination with the Muslim culture, however, first manifests itself when he takes Urdu instead of Hindi, a language he considers banal, at school. Eventually he integrates himself into the Muslim culture and marries Hyder Ali's daughter, Benazir. However this relationship is strained during the partition and the Ali's subsequent flight to Hyderabad.Desai pg. 47 Symbolism and motifs =Education= During the book education is mentioned a lot. Not just school, but also in the nightly gatherings at the Ali's. Raja and Bim both go to college, although Raja's education is much more prominent. Even Hyderabad, where he went following the Alis, is a considered a place of learning in India; it is the home of universities such as Osmania University, one of the oldest in India.NAAC. \\"INTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE CELL\\". Welcome to Osmania University Hyderabad N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Sept. 2010. Raja symbolizes culture refinement and knowledge, as does poetry. =Music= The primary manifestations of music in the book are Baba's gramophone, Dr. Biswas's musical inclinations, and Mulk's singing at the end of the book. The idea of music relating to life experiences is present. Baba constantly playing his gramophone at the same volume with the same records shows the stagnation of his development. Dr. Biswas refinement in musical taste shows the personal refinement he learned in Europe. Mulk and the Guru show that while life alters our experiences, we are still the same people; as they used the same style but with different experiences shaping their performance. This is confirmed by Mulk complaining about his sisters sending away his musicians, like the partition of India. But the musicians return at the end of the book to accompany Mulk. Tara also mentions her daughters' music but says it develops with their growth.Desai pg. 13, 38Desai pg. 177 Of particular interest is what music Desai has Baba play; all the records are from the same time period and he never gets any new ones. But the most potent of these songs seems to be \\"Don't Fence Me In\\", performed by Bing Crosby. Every primary character in the book with the exception of Bim finds some way to escape. A song about being free, however, is what angers the one character who, on the surface, had no desire to do so.Desai pg. 12, 14, 163 =Separation= The novel tells not just the story of the separation of a family, but also of a nation. The partition of India is a tangible reality that is concurrent to Raja leaving, Tara marrying, the deaths of the Das parents as well as Aunt Mira, and the separation of the Das family. These familial separations are parallel to the social events leading up to Partition and to the continued social upheaval that followed the separation of Pakistan from India. The summer of 1947 is described as tumultuous: it is the summer when Bim takes care of Raja in his illness, the Hyder Ali family abandons Delhi for Hyderabad under the threat of ethnic violence, and the father of the Das family dies. During the previous summer of 1946, the same summer that Jinnah made public demands for a Muslim homeland, the mother of the Das family had also died. The dissolution in the family that begins in 1946 parallels the growing Partition movement and the escalation of violence, such as the attacks in Calcutta in August 1946, in response to this division into two nations. In the summer of 1947, Tara marries Bakul and they leave for Ceylon (Sri Lanka), leaving Bim alone to care for the remaining family members: this coincides with the official division of India from Pakistan in August of that same year. The following summer, after the death of Gandhi earlier in January 1948 and the continued flight of refugees across Indian borders, Aunt Mira dies and Raja leaves for Hyderabad, thus isolating Bim further and leaving her to care for those who are left behind: Baba and herself. In particular, each of the three people who escaped (Tara, Raja and Aunt Mira) used a way of escape common during the Partition era: Tara fled the country for somewhere else, Raja fled to a Muslim center, and Aunt Mira left the earth entirely.Rao, P. Mallikarjuna. Postcolonial Theory and Literature. New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers and Distributors, 2003. Print. =Language= Each of the languages in Clear Light of Day represents different things. Urdu is the language of culture, refinement, and knowledge. Hindi is considered every day, mundane and banal.Desai pg. 47 Additionally the repeated examples of poetry emphasize the beauty of the one language compared to the other as more often than not they are in Urdu. Raja expounds how an Urdu poet could do that in a single couplet. Urdu symbolizes Raja and the Ali's culture and sophistication.Desai pg. 46Desai pg. 2, 41, 45, 46, 47, 50, 55, 82, 83, 98, 100, 182 =Nature= Nature is omnipresent in Anita Desai's Clear Light of Day. The children are constantly in the garden to escape the stuffy interior. Gatherings happen outside, such as at Hyder Ali's house and the Misra's; Tara's guilt is physically represented by bees; Nature is present even on clothes and in the poetry that Bim and Raja recite. It is significant that the novel begins with a description of the garden (\\"the koels began to call before daylight\\"), and Anita Desai clearly places an emphasis on setting. Nature in the novel is a source of entertainment, but more significantly, it is often analogous to the relationships and actions of the characters. The first function of Nature in the novel is as a source of entertainment and learning for the Das children. The first instance of this is when Tara, at the very beginning of the story, thinking she has seen a pearl, finds a snail instead and plays with it, as she did when they were children, performing \\"the rites of childhood over the creature\\". A few pages later, Tara muses over the \\"rustic pleasures\\" that she used to derive from the garden, longing to run to the guava trees and find a whole one to bite into. The garden is their source of refreshment in the heat of summer, and the nature filled surroundings provide Tara with reprieve from the business of her city life. The garden is \\"overgrown\\", \\"neglected\\" and \\"uncontrolled\\", not perfect and square, so she feels like she can relax and forget about her engagement book. It also shows the contrast between Tara and Bim. Nature's second function in the novel is to mirror or complement the actions or feelings of the characters in the book. Many paragraphs end with a reference to Nature, such as \\"the dog suddenly pounced upon the flea\\" or \\"a koel lifted itself out of the heavy torpor of the afternoon and called tentatively, as if enquiring into the existence of the evening\\". This offers a parallel between what has just happened in the story and the natural world. The dog pounces on the flea immediately after Bakul tells Bim that he will marry Tara, and could represent Bim's isolation beginning to trap her. The koel calls tentatively after Bim has come to an understanding of herself and her relationship with her family and is finally at peace. It could be seen as her uplifting rebirth. Another parallel we can find is the heat of the summer and the political heat of 1947. The most important analogy between Nature and the human world is the garden. At the beginning of the novel, the roses are said to have grown smaller and sicker; they are \\"dusted with disease\\". At the end of the novel, there is a dust storm which mirrors the discussion Bim and Tara are having about Raja, and which leaves the garden \\"shrouded in dust\\" and everything looking \\"ancient and bent\\". The garden, so beautiful and enjoyable in their childhood, has become old and grey as the years have progressed and the Das children have grown apart. Nature in the novel is also beautiful and dangerous at the same time. For example, mosquitoes are mentioned at the beginning as \\"singing and stinging\\", and when the gardener waters the garden, \\"bringing out the green scent of watered earth and refreshed plants\\", mynahs quarrel and parrots come, a \\"lurid, shrieking green\\", ripping flowers to bits. This carries a warning and can be compared with human relationships, especially the relationship between Tara, Bim and Raja. Finally, Nature is used as a point of comparison with the characters themselves. There is a long metaphor in which Aunt Mira and the children are compared to plants and trees, Aunt Mira being the \\"tree that grew at the centre of their lives\\": \\"Soon they grew tall, soon they grew strong. They wrapped themselves around her, smothering her in leaves and flowers. She laughed at the profusion, the beauty of this little grove that was the whole forest to her, the whole world. (…) she would just be the old log, the dried mass of roots on which they grew. She was the tree, she was the soil, she was the earth.\\" This metaphor is continued when Baba is compared to a \\"plant grown underground\\", emphasizing the difference between him and his siblings. It also contrasts with the image that we are given of the Das parents. The roses in the garden were supposedly planted by the father, but neither he nor the gardener knew how to take care of them, so although beautiful at first, they withered. The fact that Tara doesn't know for sure that her father planted them compares with his constant absence in his children's lives. Like the roses, the Das children were not properly cared for which has led them to bicker and row, ultimately failing to understand each other. The cow, warm and soft, can also be seen as the Das parents trying to offer comfort and nourishment to their children, but the cow, like the Das parents and Aunt Mira, dies, leaving the children alone, Raja and Tara longing to escape and Bim bitter. Additionally, both Aunt Mira and Tara are compared to birds, at different moments in the book. Aunt Mira, weak with alcoholism, \\"almost ceased to be human, became bird instead, and old bird with its feathers plucked, its bones jutting out from under the blue tinged skin, too antique, too crushed to move.\\" Tara, when Bim cuts off her hair, looks \\"like a baby pigeon fallen out of its nest, blue-skinned and bristly, crouching behind the water tank and crying\\". The idea of a bird too weak to fly is an accurate representation of Aunt Mira, widowed and rejected, and Tara, who is an introvert with no grand ambitions. It seems to point to what Tara might have become without Bakul, and adds to the contrast between the two sisters. =Other motifs and symbolism= *Birds *Flowers (Roses) *Duality (Light and Dark) *Stagnation *Women in India *The passage of Time Themes =Family= Bim's breakdown at the end of the book results in remarkable clarity of thought. In this insight, she concludes that the bond of family is greater than any other thing in this world, that she felt their pains, and that she couldn't live without them.Desai pg. 165 =Forgiveness= Bim's inability to forgive Raja demonstrates that the deepest hurts come from the closest bonds.Desai pg. 25, 27 However she does find it in herself at the end of the book to forgive Raja for the insult and realize the importance of family.Desai pg. 181–182 =Adolescence= A major a part of the book is devoted to the first years of the Das siblings and to how that period shaped their current lives. While Bim and Raja because the eldest siblings were sure of themselves and impressive , Tara and Baba were the smallest amount loved and grew up to be dependent—albeit in several ways— on others. the youngsters were rarely cared for in their household, then they constantly searched for affection from one another . Their experiences in adolescence were liable for their future selves, including their oft-tense relations with one another . Raja, who was selfish and proud, becomes an upscale , pompous man who remains trying to be the hero he idolized, Hyder Ali. Tara is consistently hooked in to her husband et al. to form decisions for her. Bim witnesses the degradation of her widowed aunt in her house and therefore the limitations of marriage, and she or he decides to measure a lifetime of independence. =Escapism= The Das siblings are constantly trying to flee their immediate surroundings. This need is fuelled by the shortage of attention they get from their parents. Raja starts inclining towards Islamic culture against his family’s wishes, Tara first seeks attention from Mira Masi and starts to spend longer with the Misra sisters, ultimately marrying Bakul and leaving Delhi . Baba also tries to flee his immediate surroundings, albeit during a more unconscious manner, by constantly playing an equivalent music on a loop. These three characters are propelled by the necessity to repress unpleasant memories of their childhood. Bim appears to be the sole one that doesn’t want to flee her family. However, because the story progresses, one sees through chinks in Bim’s armor. She is consistently hurt by her siblings and wishes to escape—this time, ironically, into the past. Poetry in Clear Light of Day In this book, Desai quotes poems 12 different times, in addition to using a line by Iqbal as a part of a song at the end of the book.Desai pg. 2, 41, 45, 46, 47, 50, 55, 83, 98, 100, 182 Poets quoted include T.

In their definitive historical work The Oboe, Geoffrey Burgess and Bruce Haynes write (page 212) \\"The differences are most clearly marked in the middle register, which is reedier and more pungent, and the upper register, which is richer in harmonics on the Viennese oboe\\". Guntram Wolf describes them: \\"From the concept of the bore, the Viennese oboe is the last representative of the historical oboes, adapted for the louder, larger orchestra, and fitted with an extensive mechanism. Its great advantage is the ease of speaking, even in the lowest register. It can be played very expressively and blends well with other instruments.\\" Guntram Wolf The Viennese oboe is (with the Viennese horn) perhaps the most distinctive member of the Vienna Philharmonic instrumentarium.  History  The oboe in use in Vienna in the early and mid-19th century was originally a design called the Koch/Sellner oboe. In 1825 Viennese oboist and teacher Joseph Sellner wrote an oboe tutor (Theoretische-praktische Oboeschule), which included an illustrated fingering chart. The oboe associated with these materials was produced by Stefan Koch (1772–1828). This instrument was very well regarded in central Europe. In addition to a modernized mechanism with up to 13 keys, the Koch/Sellner oboe resembled the conservatoire oboe used today in that it had a narrow bore and a similarly bright tone. As a relatively advanced musical tool it satisfied the needs of Viennese musicians until the end of the 19th Century. One instrument maker whose designs went in the opposite direction, utilizing a wide bore design, was the highly regarded German maker Karl Friedrich Golde (1803–1873) from Dresden. His ideal oboe sound contained a deep, rich, warm tonality: \\"a powerful depth and a full sound will be achieved, … [not] a thin, nasal sound, like the French and Viennese [Koch] oboes.”Rauch 1999 Ironically, just a few years after his death his design would supplant the Koch oboe and become the new Wiener Oboe of the 20th Century. In 1880 oboist Richard Baumgärtel (1858–1941) brought his Golde oboe with him to Vienna, where the essential design was subsequently adapted by Josef Hajek (1849–1926) to play in the ‘diapason normal’ tuning of A = 435 used in the Austrian Empire. Hajek and later other makers, notably Hermann Zuleger (1885–1949) created a new instrument with changes and improvements especially to the key mechanism. The new Wiener Oboe retained the essence of the classical oboe’s internal bore, as well as elegantly simplified classical external features such as the baluster and finial, but with greatly expanded keywork. The aftermath of the second world war witnessed the takeover of the Conservatoire oboe and a slow phase-out of the \\"German oboe\\" in Germany. In Austria the Wiener Oboe faced a period of general decline, and with the death of Zuleger in 1949 sources of quality instruments became scarce. This unsatisfactory situation only worsened as time went by, with the construction of instruments almost coming to a standstill. In the 1980s, however, the Yamaha company in Japan began to manufacture Wiener Oboen, creating a hitherto unprecedented supply of quality instruments. With the resurgence of interest in early music in the late 20th century, the Wiener Oboe has emerged as an alternative to the use of hautboys or baroque oboes, retaining the tone color of the early instruments but not the significant limitations. In more recent years, as interest and use of the Wiener Oboe has slowly increased, oboes are now being made by a number of makers such as André Constantinides, Karl Rado, Guntram Wolf, and Christian Rauch.  Materials  The modern Wiener Oboe is most commonly made from grenadilla, though some manufacturers also make oboes out of the traditional European material boxwood.

Based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, United States, Triumph engineers, designs, and manufactures aircraft components, systems and accessories. Several services and products are offered through three of their operating organizations, Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, and Product Support. Triumph Group serves original equipment manufacturers of regional, commercial, military and business aircraft and components, as well as air cargo carriers and regional and commercial airlines. History =1980s= Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.Charles Hill, Gareth Jones, Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach (Cengage Learning, 2009; ), p. 431 By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company. In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue. =1990s= In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services. In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales. In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors. In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services. In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue. The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998). In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve- month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold. In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft. In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks. =2000s= In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies. In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio. Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004. In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group. =2010s= In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier. In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years. In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned. Ill was also the chairman since 2009, so when he took over the CEO position after Frisby left, he was succeeded by one of the company's board members, U.S. Air Force (Ret.) Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart.

In the 2018 provincial election, Higgs and his party won the largest share of seats in the legislature, 22, compared to 21 for the governing Liberal Party of New Brunswick, which opted to attempt to remain in power as a minority government by presenting a Throne Speech in hopes of retaining the confidence of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. On November 2, 2018 the Progressive Conservatives and the People's Alliance combined to defeat Premier Brian Gallant's Liberal minority government via a non confidence vote in the legislature. Higgs was appointed Premier on November 9, 2018. At 64 years of age at the time of swearing-in, Higgs is the oldest person to be sworn in as Premier in New Brunswick history, and in April of 2019 became the oldest ever Premier in New Brunswick history, surpassing Leonard Percy de Wolfe Tilley in both records. In 2019, Higgs began repealing several financial assistance programs for New Brunswick students attending post-secondary institutions. His party deemed programs such as the Timely Completion Benefit, established in May 2009,Timely Completion Benefit now available. gnb.ca, May 13, 2009. to be \\"very costly\\".Province Makes Changes To Tuition Bursary Program. thewave.ca, April 9, 2019. The Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick believed redistributing the funds allocated to this program through a tuition tax credit was a \\"better\\" way to reach more students.Changes to tuition bursary program mean more students will get less money. cbc.ca, April 9, 2019. This move, along with the removal of the Free Tuition Program, were highly criticized by students across the province, with some emphasizing that there is no longer any incentive to remain in New Brunswick to work or study.University students face 'lose-lose' scenario after free tuition program scuppered. cbc.ca, April 13, 2019. Higgs and the Progressive Conservatives were re-elected to a majority government in the 2020 provincial election held on September 14, 2020.

The Sierra Nevada mountain range, also known locally as the \\"Sierra\\" or \\"Sierra Nevada\\", run north-to- south along eastern California, and occasionally in western Nevada. The name \\"Sierra Nevada\\" is Spanish, translating as \\"Snowy (Mountain) Range\\". Geography The Sierra Nevada's immense size in length and height, geological age, and wide variety of ecosystems and habitats present, make them home to one of the most diverse collections of distinct plant species in the United States. The Sierras are bordered by: the Great Basin in rain shadow on the east; the Cascade Range on the north; the Central Valley—San Joaquin Valley on the west; the Tehachapi Mountains linking the Transverse Ranges on the southwest; and the Mojave Desert on the south. =Phytogeography= In phytogeography, concerned with the geographic distribution of plant species, floristic provinces are used. The Sierra Nevada are primarily within the California Floristic Province, with the Rocky Mountain Floristic Province to the north, the Great Basin Floristic Province to the east, and Sonoran Floristic Province to the south. =Biogeography= Biogeography looks at the spatial and temporal distributions of species. A descending hierarchy is used, with a realms at the top, then biomes, followed by smaller terrestrial ecoregions. The Sierra Nevada are a small part of the North American continental Nearctic realm. The Sierras contain portions of two Nearctic biomes: *The lower elevation western Sierra foothills are in the Nearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and shrub biome: which is represented here by the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion's California interior chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion. *The valleys and mountains higher up are in the Nearctic temperate coniferous forests biome: which is represented here by the Sierra Nevada Forests ecoregion. =Plants and distributions= :*This list of native plants is organized by elevational distribution ranges and their plant communities. Some plants with a broader altitudinal range are found listed in their predominant habitat elevation. :*All the plant species listed are native to the Sierra's foothills, valleys, and mountains. In addition some are also endemic to here and elsewhere within California - (ca- endemic); and some are further endemic to and only found in the Sierra Nevada - (sn-endemic).

The output is another forecasted matrix of mortality rates. The model uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) to find a univariate time series vector \\"kt\\" that captures 80–90% of the mortality trend (here the subscript \\"t\\" refers to time), a vector \\"bx\\" that describes the amount of mortality change at a given age for a unit of yearly total mortality change (here the subscript \\"x\\" refers to age), and a scaling constant (referred to here as s1 but unnamed in the literature). Surprisingly, kt is usually linear, implying that gains to life expectancy are fairly constant year after year in most populations. Before being input to the SVD, age specific mortality rates are transformed into \\"ax,t\\", by taking their logarithms, and then centering them by subtracting their age-specific means (calculated over time). (The subscript \\"x,t\\" refers to the fact that ax,t spans both age and time.) Many researchers adjust the kt vector by fitting it to empirical life expectancies for each year, using the ax and bx just generated with the SVD; when adjusted using this approach, changes to kt are usually small. To forecast mortality, the above kt (either adjusted or not) is projected into the future using ARIMA time series methods, the corresponding future ax,t+n is recovered by multiplying kt+n by bx and the appropriate diagonal element of S (when [U S V] = svd(mort)), and the actual mortality rates are recovered by taking exponentials of this vector. Because of the linearity of kt, it is generally modeled as a random walk with trend. Life expectancy and other life table measures can be calculated from this forecasted matrix after adding back the means and taking exponentials to yield regular mortality rates. In most implementations, confidence intervals for the forecasts are generated by simulating multiple mortality forecasts using Monte Carlo Methods; a band of mortality between 5% and 95% percentiles of the simulated results is considered to be a valid forecast. These simulations are done by extending kt into the future using randomization based on the standard error of kt derived from the input data. In outline and Matlabstyle pseudocode, the algorithm is as follows: # Create ax by taking logarithms of the mortality rates and centering the results with the average log mortality at a given age. # Derive kt, a scaling eigenvalue, and bx from U(:,1), S(1,1), V(1,:), where [U S V] = svd(mort). # Forecast kt with standard univariate ARIMA methods. # Use the forecast kt with the original bx and ax to calculate logged mortality rates for each forecast year. # Recover regular mortality rates by calculating the exponential of the forecasted log mortality rates. Without applying SVD or some other method of dimension reduction the table of mortality data is a highly correlated multivariate data series; the complexity of these multidimensional time series makes such them almost impossible to forecast. SVD has become widely used as a method of dimension reduction in many disparate fields, including by Google in their page rank algorithm. The Lee–Carter model was introduced by Ronald D. Lee and Lawrence Carter in 1992 with the article \\"Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality,\\" (Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (September): 659–671). The model grew out of their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s attempting to use inverse projection to infer rates in historical demography.http://escholarship.org/uc/item/76b3712p The model has been used by the United States Social Security Administration, the US Census Bureau, and the United Nations. It has become the most widely used mortality forecasting technique in the world today.http://gking.harvard.edu/files/lc.pdf There have been extensions to the Lee–Carter, most notably to account for missing years, correlated male and female populations, and large scale coherency in populations that share a mortality regime (western Europe, for example). Many related papers can be found on Professor Ronald Lee's website. There are surprisingly few software packages for forecasting with the Lee–Carter model. LCFIT is a web-based package with interactive forms. Professor Rob J. Hyndman provides an R package for demography that includes routines for creating and forecasting a Lee–Carter model. Alternatives in R include the StMoMo package of Villegas, Millossovich and Kaishev (2015), and some other they list. Professor German Rodriguez provides code for the Lee–Carter Model using Stata. Using Matlab, Professor Eric Jondeau and Professor Michael Rockinger have put together the Longevity Toolbox for parameter estimation.

It shortens the course of cutaneous disease and may protect against its dissemination.Wilkinson, Iain and Lennox, Graham (June 2005). Essential Neurology (4th ed.). Wiley- Blackwell. p. 263 . Varicella zoster virus is a human herpes virus that causes chickenpox, shingles, Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II, and postherpetic neuralgia. Unlike a Zoster vaccine which provides durable immunity, the protection is passive and short term; it may need to be readministered every 2-4 weeks as necessary. This medication is not recommended for administration to immune-competent persons for treatment of active disease. The immunoglobulin is prepared from the plasma of healthy donors with high titers of antibodies to VZV. A study was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases that showed outdated blood from blood banks may have antibody concentrations that were equivalent to those in plasma of donors recovering from recent VZV infection that resulted in elevated levels of zoster immune globulin.\\"Evaluation of Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin: Protection of Immunosuppressed Children after Household Exposure to Varicella\\" Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Biography  Jorge Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves was born on 22 February 1920, in Ponta do Sol, municipal seat of Ribeira Grande, on the island of Santo Antão in Portuguese Cape Verde. He was the son of Portuguese civil engineer and inventor Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves and Elvira da Conceição Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves. He was also brother of Maria Helena da Costa Dias. He was also nephews of Maria Alexandrina Pires Ferreira Chaves, Olímpio Ferreira Chaves and João Carlos Pires Ferreira Chaves. From 1931 he lived in Lisbon. = Education = He studied architecture at the Escola de Belas Artes de Lisboa (), having entered in 1935. Arquivo da Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade Técnica de Lisboa In 1941, his degree program was interrupted because of military service during World War II, stationed with Portuguese expeditionary forces on the island of São Miguel in the Azores. He remained on the island until 1944. He rejoined the School of Fine Arts in 1944 to finish the architecture degree and was awarded the 1946 José Luis Monteiro Prize, which included a monetary stipend for students achieving academic excellence. The prize was significant, since it had not been awarded the previous years, and had accumulated. Simultaneously, in 1946-1947, he attended the Sculpture degree. In 1948, he graduated in architecture. In his diploma application exam (), in 1953, Jorge Chaves obtained a significant passing grade: 19 out of 20. = Career = His professional career started during the period of 1943-1956; a period which Nuno Portas PORTAS, Nuno - “A evolução da Arquitectura Moderna” in ZEVI, Bruno “História da Arquitectura Moderna”; Editora Arcádia (p. 729) has designated as the stage of \\"resistance\\" in Portuguese architecture and art. From 1944 to 1946, in the final years at university, he collaborated with architect Joaquim Ferreira. During this period, he also collaborated, occasionally, with architects Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and Alberto Soeiro. In 1946 he set up his first office together with his graduation classmate Luís Coelho Borges. He was a member of ICAT - Iniciativas Culturais Arte e Técnica () and also of the Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes (). He participated in four sessions of the EGAP Exposições Gerais de Artes Plásticas () by presenting architectural projects. In 1948, he participated in the 1º Congresso Nacional de Arquitectura (). : One of his \\"post - 48 Congress\\" projects was the Laboratorios Cannobio building, designed in 1948 and built in 1949. This was one of the first buildings to emerge in the Centre of Lisbon displaying an architectural language clearly engaged with the Modern Movement. : His project for the street corner of Rua Braancamp 7 with Rua Mouzinho da Silveira would also have been so, had it not been rejected for \\"aesthetic reasons”, by the conservative Municipality of Lisbon. In parallel with project activity in his own office, he collaborated with the office of architect Miguel Jacobetty Rosa, between 1948 and 1952, and did an internship under the direction of architect Hernâni Gandra during 1951. In 1952 he was invited to the office of the architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro, with whom he worked in designing the Palácio da Rotunda AGAREZ, Ricardo Costa - “O Moderno revisitado” - Habitação multifamiliar em Lisboa nos anos de 1950”; edição da C.M.L.; 2009 (p. 279) and Sorel buildings,CALDAS, João Vieira, 1997. Porfírio Pardal Monteiro: Arquitecto, Lisboa: Associação dos Arquitectos Portugueses. (p. 91) but especially the Hotel Ritz in Lisbon, \\"a remarkable work, for its aesthetic wisdom and excellence of material execution \\". FERNANDES, José Manuel – “Que viva a Mexicana! (ou a batalha da Mexicana)” in “Lisboa em obras”; 1997; Livros horizonte. (pp. 205 a 208 ) During architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro illness and after his death in 1957, he ensured the continuity of the project of the hotel, by giving assistance to the construction and by heading the phase of execution in a special office built in the site, CALDAS, João Vieira, 1997. Porfírio Pardal Monteiro: Arquitecto, Lisboa: Associação dos Arquitectos Portugueses. (p. 94) until its inauguration in 1959. Although the design of Hotel Ritz was his core activity from 1952 to 1959, he kept his own office to which he was exclusively dedicated after 1959. : His most significant architectural production took place during a period characterized as \\"of a relative opening of the (dictatorial) regime to accept modern architecture\\". PORTAS, Nuno - “A evolução da Arquitectura Moderna” in ZEVI, Bruno “História da Arquitectura Moderna”; Editora Arcádia (pp. 738-739) During the 1960s, he developed a specific trait, recognizable in such works as the “Pastelaria Mexicana” in Lisbon or the “Hotel Garbe” and the “Hotel Baleeira” in the Algarve and also in housing in Olivais Sul, Rua da Penha de França and Rua da Ilha do Príncipe in Lisbon. This latter case has been referred to as \\"perhaps the best urban intervention for housing in Lisbon in that decade\\". : The “Chamber of Commerce of Bissau” (), the headquarters of the Guinea’s Trade, Industry and Agriculture Association (), is considered the most qualified architectural achievement in Bissau during the colonial period. : At the end of the 1950s he produced the “remarkable work of Caixa Geral de Depósitos bank in São Pedro do Sul, clearly influenced by the survey on vernacular architecture in Portugal () that was carried out in the late 1950s. : \\"The Pastelaria Mexicana (a Lisbon cafe and snack-bar) is a highly remarkable example that led to the limits, in that period and in Portugal, the expressionist trends created inside the Modern Movement since the early 20th century\\" and that \\"developed a phenomenological sense of architectural vision that reached a climax, deemed even exceptional, in the history of architecture in Portugal.\\" : \\"Broken line profiles and non-straight angles, key elements of an international lineage organicism rediscovered in the 1960s\\", are \\" brilliantly integrated in this perfect example of \\"total design\\".\\" The process of its classification as a monument of public interest has been ongoing in IGESPAR since 1996, after an intervention, in that same year, that changed significantly some parts of its architecture. It retains, however, part of the elements that motivated, in 1993, such a proposed classification. Several of his major works, such as the “Pastelaria Mexicana” (cafe), the “Palissi Galvani” shop and the Hotel Florida in Lisbon, the Hotel Garbe, the Hotel da Baleeira and the Hotel Globo in the Algarve or the Chamber of Commerce of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau include conceptually integrated visual arts interventions, some created by himself. The visual artists Jorge Vieira, José Escada, Martins Correia, Paulo Guilherme d'Eça Leal, Sena da Silva, Hein Semke, Querubim Lapa, Mario Costa, António Alfredo and João Câmara Leme were invited to intervene in his works. In his career, he was accompanied in some of the listed projects, by the associated architects Luís Coelho Borges, Álvaro Valladas Petersen, Anselmo Fernandez Rodriguez, Eduardo Goulard Medeiros, Artur Pires Martins, Cândido Palma de Melo and also by Mario Xavier Antunes, Jorge Herédia, Frederico Sant'Ana and Vítor Sousa Figueiredo, who were internship members of his office and carried on collaborating with him. His work also developed on the wide urban scale and he had an important role in the development of industrial design in Portugal. For the equipment of his buildings and interior designs, Jorge Ferreira Chaves always designed original furniture or chose mainly Portuguese designed and manufactured fixtures and objects. From 1978 to 1981, he designed interventions in public buildings, as an Architect of the Ministry of Public Works (). He died in Lisbon on August 22, 1981.

He studied Indology and Ethnology at Leiden University (MA 1950, PhD 1955) under the renowned Jan Petrus Benjamin de Josselin de Jong. He worked as a ‘government anthropologist’ and conducted extensive fieldwork in Netherlands New Guinea (now West Papua), 1951-62. He subsequently served as Professor of Anthropology at Amsterdam, Wellington (N.Z./Aotearoa) and Nijmegen Universities, 1962-87. Many of his concerns and much of his work can be viewed as a 'text' framed within the 'context' of Leiden Structuralism, itself part of the larger field of modern anthropology. He enriched this field with insights in configurational comparison and the dialectical character of social structure, mythology, gender and ritual. A dedicated teacher, Pouwer's ideas are not to be found in a single volume. They exist, like some forms of mythology, in several outlines and sketches. Over the course of his career, Pouwer published two books (one his 1955 PhD thesis) and a wide range of articles. His last book, Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua: A Configurational Analysis Comparing Kamoro and Asmat, was published at Leiden in 2010. It can be downloaded from OAPEN for no cost. Professional career Pouwer studied Indology and Ethnology at Leiden University (first degree July 1, 1947; second degree November 14, 1950), a study leading to an academic degree for the Netherlands Indies Public Administration that included: Malayan and Javanese languages, Comparative Ethnology of the Netherlands Indies, Islamic Institutions, Overseas History, Constitutional and Customary Law, Western and Non-Western Economics, Cultural Anthropology. He worked briefly as a lecturer at Utrecht University (1951), then took off on a career as a ‘government anthropologist’ in Netherlands New Guinea, 1951-62. He obtained his PhD on anthropological fieldwork among the Mimika in the Netherlands New Guinea at Leiden in 1955. He was a research officer (gouvernmentsethnoloog) at the Bureau for Native Affairs (Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken) in Hollandia (now Jayapura), Netherlands New Guinea, 1951–60; served as Acting Advisor for Native Affairs in 1960-1961, as Advisor for Native Affairs in 1962. He conducted fieldwork among the Kamoro people in the coastal Mimika-area (South- West New Guinea), 1951–54; undertook a two-months’ survey on social structure, land-tenure, prestige economy and some moot problems of acculturation in the areas surrounding the Ajamaru lakes, Central Bird’s Head, West New Guinea, 1956; six months of research into the effects of commercial films on the ideas, values and behavior of urban Papuans, 1956; four months of fieldwork in the rugged highlands of the Northwestern Bird’s Head (Anggi lakes and surroundings), mainly among two highly dispersed tribes, 1957; eight months of fieldwork as a member of the Dutch scientific expedition to the Star Mountains (Sterrengebergte) near the border between West New Guinea and Papua, 1959; the Iwur region, south of the Star Mountains; the urban community of Tugunese people (1961), a mixture of Indonesian, Portuguese, Dutch, German and Papuan origin, who left their village near Jakarta in 1950 to settle in Hollandia (now Jayapura) and who were expected to migrate to the Netherlands in 1962. His 1955 PhD thesis at Leiden, Enkele aspecten van de Mimika-cultuur, Nederlands Zuidwest Nieuw Guinea (Some aspects of Mimika Culture, Netherlands South-West New Guinea), was based on twenty-five months of fieldwork among the Mimika (Kamoro) people. Pouwer makes frequent reference to it in many of his published papers. In the Prologue to his 2010 book, he notes (2010:3) that a request to have the thesis translated into English was unsuccessful and that this reduced access for those with a limited reading knowledge of Dutch. Shortly before his death, Pouwer concluded a synthetic monograph comparing Kamoro and Asmat culture, based on his own fieldwork, missionary and administrative reports, and anthropological studies (Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua. Leiden, 2010). In this work Pouwer makes use of a distinction between the symbolic and existential dimensions of social action as refined by Bruce Knauft (1993) while, at the same time and contra Knauft, using a configurational approach to demonstrate the difference between the neighbouring Kamoro and Asmat peoples. Teaching experience: as part of his official duties Pouwer taught general anthropology and ethnography of New Guinea at the School of Public Administration (Bestuursschool) in Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, 1955-58. He was Full Professor of Cultural Anthropology, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1962–66; Foundation Professor and Head of the Department of Anthropology and Maori Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, 1966–76; and Senior Lecturer, Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology, Catholic University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 1976-87. He was a Visiting Professor at Monash University (Australia) in 1971 and at the Universities of Toronto (Canada), Leiden and Utrecht (the Netherlands) in 1972. =General Overview= One theme which runs through Pouwer's work, both published and unpublished, is the need for new approaches to understanding the social formations of other peoples. In his work he was always aware of a dialectical relationship, in terms of systems of significations, between the anthropologist as an observer and the lived realities of other peoples. There was never any easy resting place for dogma in Pouwer's teaching. He not only embraced paradox and contradiction as necessary features of knowledge, he also emphasized the ongoing dialectical movement from doubt to certainty to doubt ... His New Guinea experiences lead him to seriously question the use of descent-based anthropological models developed in Africa. Characterising descent as a vertical form of arrangement, Pouwer noted that \\"... the structural importance of the horizontal arrangement of kin has been neglected.\\" (Pouwer 1967:92) He added that, without taking \\"...the horizontal arrangement into explicit consideration ... the structure of New Guinea systems will not be intelligible to us.\\"(ibid) Pouwer's work also demonstrates a consistent attempt to capture, within a strict discipline, something of life's movement. This tension in his work may have resulted from his immersion in New Guinea lived realities and the lack of fit between those realities and Western understanding. Possibly for this reason Pouwer did not embrace a purely structuralist position à la Lévi-Strauss. Pouwer was a foremost advocate of a configurational approach for cross-cultural comparison with an emphasis on the importance of 'relative position' of elements within an arrangement rather than on elements themselves. Pouwer's configurational approach has a synchronic aspect (comparison between cultures) and a diachronic aspect which (following Lévi-Strauss) he called 'structural history'. The configurational approach to cross-cultural comparison may also be viewed against other attempts such as those of structural functionalism, which dealt with institutions and functions.For example, the comparative functionalism of Walter Goldschmidt. Some of the other themes which ran through his teaching (during his years in Wellington, New Zealand-Aotearoa) do not appear strongly in his published work. These include an emphasis on complementary opposition and a both-and approach (in comparison to an either/or logic). Other themes range from a review of Dutch New Guinea as an Ethnological Field of Study (1961) to a 'travel guide' to the myths of Kamoro and Asmat peoples (2002). In the latter, Pouwer brings an anthropological perspective spanning some fifty years to materials collected by others including Dutch missionaries such as Father G. A. Zegwaard. =Field of Study= Pouwer's deep concern with questions regarding cross-cultural comparison (and avoiding the comparison of incomparables) was related to the Leiden School's tradition as well as to the theoretical problems of general anthropology. The role played by J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong's idea of \\"Field of Ethnological Study\\" (later, under P.E. de Josselin de Jong, \\"Field of Anthropological Study\\" FAS) leads to questions of how to compare and contrast different socio-cultural formations within an area deemed to constitute a field of study. In place of typologies of cultures or simple comparison of 'elements' Pouwer asserted that a concern for 'relative position' of elements is a fundamental structuralist tenet. Pouwer's work demonstrated a Leiden FAS concern for socio-cosmic aspects including dualism and First Peoples' (indigenous) cosmology. He wrote about New Guinea as a field of ethnographic study in 1961 and revisited the topic in 1992. =Configurational Approach= In addition to his 1960s article on a configurational approach, Pouwer spelled out more of his understanding of configurations in 1974. There Pouwer put forward structuring principles which can \\"...form a system of relations, a configuration ...\\". These include two complementary basic structuring principles: (a) Identical positioning, and (b) Contra-positioning. There are three derived general structuring principles: (c) Reciprocal positioning, (d) Equi-positioning, (e) Supra-positioning. To these are added the derived particular structuring principles: (f) vertical positioning, (g) Horizontal positioning, and (h) Concentric positioning. (Pouwer 1974:241-242) In his 2010 book Pouwer said: \\"By 'configuration' I mean a process that turns elements into components arranged and imbued with meaning by a central orientation...Both configuration and orientation can be conceived of as always being on the move, never closed, always open to change, ambivalence and contradiction. A configuration approach assumes a central orientation that permeates a particular society and culture.\\" (Pouwer 2010:7-8)Reimar Schefold 1994:805 on configurational comparisons in relation to FAS. =Descent versus Siblingship = Pouwer's fieldwork in New Guinea caused him to question the privileged position within modern anthropology given to the notion of 'descent'. He found that there were cases where siblingship was more important in New Guinean people's lives than 'descent'. It is clear from his writings that his fieldwork experiences led him to look for other ways of properly characterising his ethnographic data. Casting various forms of 'descent' as modalities of 'vertical' arrangement (as derived from general structuring principles), he sought to accommodate the 'horizontal' relationships found in New Guinean social life. In his 1974 article he was able to conclude that \\"The narrow and often shaky criterion of descent is no longer useful or required, nor is it logically defensible. It can be superseded by the criteria of vertical and horizontal arrangement ...\\" (Pouwer, 1974:251-252) =Structuralism and Semiotics= Pouwer's intellectual approach to social structure followed that of Claude Lévi-Strauss and stood in contrast to the naive empiricism of Radcliffe-Brown. Pouwer, in keeping with a sense of 'becoming' imminent in life, also developed the notion of 'structuration'. It is noticeable in his later work that Pouwer does not follow Lévi-Strauss into a structuralist analysis of myth and ritual. In his 1975 article he distances himself from an examination of paradigmatic relations at the expense of syntagmatic movements. Pouwer pays homage in that work to a \\"Holy Trinity\\" of three levels of articulation: 1. symbolic (relationship between signifier and signified), 2. paradigmatic (relationship of one sign to another in its relative position to other signs in a system (limited)), 3. syntagmatic (chain of signs projected in a particular space, time and discourse (unlimited)). All three levels are to be respected. \\"The paramount postulate is that things and events should be studied as if they were signs. The thing-analogy, a tacit postulate of so many studies of social facts and initiated by Durkheim, should be abandoned.\\" (Pouwer 1975:97) =Structural History= Pouwer did not accept a division of labour between history and anthropology, although his history was one of configurations of structuring principles. \\"... the history of the succession of varying configurations of structuring principles in their dialectical interaction with the stream of signified events, has barely begun ...\\" (Pouwer 1974:253) =Reciprocity= Reciprocity formed a chapter of Pouwer's PhD thesis (1955:161-211). The special place of reciprocity in his work stems from Marcel Mauss, author of \\"The Gift\\" (1925), who has been cast as an 'ancestor' of Leiden structural anthropologyJarich Oosten 2006 on this relationship as well as from the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss (making use of the same source). Pouwer found reciprocity to be a striking feature of New Guinean life and wrote about aopao (Kamoro - reciprocity) as a total social fact covering all aspects of Mimika culture. (Pouwer 1975:86; 2002:30;2010:11-13) Like New Guinean peoples, the notion of reciprocity (and the lack of it) provided Pouwer with a means of comparing aspects of life across socio-cultural boundaries.

Initially symptoms present as periodic attacks of abnormal eye movements but may intensify to longer-lasting motor incapacity. The disorder has been localized to the vestibulocerebellum, specifically the flocculonodular lobe. Symptoms of vestibulocerebellar syndrome may appear in early childhood but the full onset of neurological symptoms including nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), ataxia (loss of voluntary muscle coordination), and tinnitus (perception of sound in the absence of external stimulation) does not occur until early adulthood. To date, vestibulocerebellar syndrome has only been identified in three families but has affected multiple generations within them. Based on the familial pedigrees it has been characterized as an autosomal dominant disorder, although the exact genetic locus has not been identified. It has been found to be genetically distinct from other seemingly similar forms of neurological syndromes such as episodic ataxia types 1 and 2. Due to its rarity, however, little is known about specific details of the pathology or long-term treatment options. There is currently no cure for vestibulocerebellar syndrome, although some drug therapies have been effective in alleviating particular symptoms of the disorder. Anterior view of the cerebellum showing the flocculus and nodulus of the vestibulocerebellum.  Symptoms  The symptoms of vestibulocerebellar syndrome vary among patients but are typically a unique combination of ocular abnormalities including nystagmus, poor or absent smooth pursuit (ability of the eyes to follow a moving object), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), diplopia (double vision), oscillopsia (the sensation that stationary objects in the visual field are oscillating) and abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex (reflex eye adjustment to stabilize gaze during head movement). Gaze-paretic nystagmus, one of the most common symptoms among patients results in poor gaze-holding due to neuron integrator dysfunction. Rebound nystagmus is also frequently found in conjunction with gaze-paretic nystagmus and is characteristic of cerebellar malfunction. These abnormal eye movements are often the earliest indicators of the disorder and may appear during childhood. The time of full onset of symptoms, including motor abnormalities, ranges from age 30 to age 60. Initially, symptoms present as isolated episodic attacks but occur at increasing frequency over time and may eventually become a permanent condition. In conjunction with eye abnormalities patients also present with periodic attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and ataxia that are associated with sudden changes in head position. Attacks were seen to vary in duration from a few minutes to months in different individuals and were often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. During a typical attack, patients reported having ataxic gait with a tendency to fall to either side while lacking the ability to walk heel-to-toe. With more severe attacks, patients had to sit down due to extreme unsteadiness. Fine motor abilities, such as writing and buttoning clothes, became impaired during an attack. However, speech remained unaffected. Attacks did not cause a loss of consciousness nor did they disturb mental activity. Once the attack ended, oscillopsia faded and the intensity of nystagmus decreased. Although these attacks are similar to episodic ataxia, patients with vestibulocerebellar syndrome do not completely lose motor control in arms and legs or experience dysarthria (poor speech articulation), as patients with episodic ataxia do. The disturbances to vestibular function during periodic attacks are the primary distinction between vestibulocerebellar syndrome and other similar neurological syndromes. These conditions do not consistently cause the symptoms of dizziness and ocular impairment that have been localized to the vestibulocerebellum, leading researchers to characterize vestibulocerebellar syndrome as a distinct disorder.  Causes  The mechanism of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Vestibulocerebellar syndrome is caused by a failure in the function of the flocculus of the vestibulocerebellum, one of the three main divisions of the cerebellum. Generally, the cerebellum is responsible for regulating motor commands. The main function of the vestibulocerebellum is to receive sensory input from the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and to regulate equilibrium, balance, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex accordingly. The vestibulo-ocular reflex, one of the primary areas affected by vestibulocerebellar syndrome, is responsible for counterrotating the eyes in response to head movements. This allows gaze to stay fixed on a specific point. A failure in this reflex results in a variety of eye movement abnormalities, such as those exhibited in vestibulocerebellar syndrome.Purves, Dale. Neuroscience. 4th ed. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer, 2008. Vestibulocerebellar syndrome has been categorized as an autosomal dominant neurological disorder although the specific effect on the vestibulocerebellum is unknown. It is possible that inheritance causes abnormalities in either the flocculus or in structures that project into the flocculus to maintain stability of the retinal image of stationary or moving visual objects. Pathological symptoms of the disorder may appear within the first 1–2 years of life although time of onset varies greatly among patients. The severity of symptoms typically progresses with age. The exact cause of the disorder and its pathogenic effect on the flocculus is unknown. A single genetic locus, however, critical in early eye movement control pathways on chromosome 13q31-q33 has been discovered. This locus may be involved in some of the ocular abnormalities that occur in affected individuals. Chromosome 13q31-q33, however, has not been seen to correspond to any known existing gene or locus responsible for congenital nystagmus, one of the primary symptoms of vestibulocerebellar syndrome, or for better-understood cerebellar ataxias. Vestibulocerebellar syndrome shares clinical similarities with autosomal dominant ataxias, particularly episodic ataxia types 1 and 2. These similarities include gaze-evoked and rebound nystagmus and vertigo. Furthermore, the symptoms appear to progress over time. The molecular basis of many of these other disorders has been thoroughly established and in some cases a genetic locus has been identified. Despite the similarities between symptoms of episodic ataxia and vestibulocerebellar syndrome, studies of affected individuals have shown that the disorder is genetically distinct from these other similar neurological conditions. To date, the molecular basis of vestibulocerebellar syndrome remains undefined. Diagnosis  Management  Attacks of vestibulocerebellar syndrome may be triggered by a sudden change in head position, fatigue, or by being in an environment of fast-moving objects. These attacks may be alleviated by lying quietly with eyes closed for fifteen to thirty minutes. Lying down stabilizes the head in a fixed position while closing the eyes removes the unstable sensory input responsible for the dizziness. Treatment is presently focused on addressing specific symptoms to alleviate the nausea that often accompanies attacks and to make daily life more manageable. There have been very few studies on the effectiveness of drugs that are used for the management of other ataxias on vestibulocerebellar syndrome. Trials with acetazolamide achieved some success, while amitriptyline hydrochloride was unsuccessful. Acetazolamide therapy proved effective in treating episodic vertigo. In trials with patients afflicted with vestibulocerebellar syndrome, acetazolamide either eliminated or significantly decreased the frequency and severity of vertigo episodes. Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate) and antihistamine drugs have also been helpful in decreasing the frequency and severity of attacks.  Prognosis  There is currently no cure for vestibulocerebellar ataxia. When a diagnosis is made in early adulthood on the basis of periodic attacks of vertigo, diplopia, and tinnitus, one can expect recurrent episodes of progressive ataxia later in life. In order to confirm the presence of vestibulocerebellar ataxia, a family examination demonstrating similar symptoms is critical in order to prevent a misdiagnosis. A person afflicted with this disorder will find daily tasks increasingly difficult as progressive ataxia develops. Attacks can eventually increase with more frequency and become a permanent condition.  Origin and history  Periodic vestibulocerebellar syndrome has been discovered in several generations of three families with genetic ties to Johnston County, North Carolina. The first was discovered in 1963 by T.W. Farmer and a group of researchers who studied and published a paper on the syndrome. The second case was studied and published in 1984 by Vance et al.Vance, J. M., M. A. Pericak- Vance, C. S. Payne, J. T. Coin, and C. W. Olanow. \\"Linkage and Genetic Analysis in Adult Onset Periodic Vestibulo-Cerebellar Ataxia: Report of a New Family.\\" American Journal of Human Genetics 36 (1984): 78S Individuals in these families were categorized as affected if they exhibited one form of primary criteria (ataxia, marked loss of smooth pursuit, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression) and at least one secondary criteria (mild loss of smooth pursuit, mild gaze-evoked nystagmus, and esophoria or esotropia). Historically vestibulocerebellar syndrome has been difficult to classify because of the variation in symptoms, severity, and time of onset. During the earlier stages of attacks, members of the third family classified as having vestibulocerebellar syndrome were unaware that other family members experienced the same debilitating symptoms. It was not until after researchers, Vance et al. examined the family history that a diagnosis was made characterizing three generations of the family as affected by vestibulocerebellar syndrome. In addition to these variations, vestibulocerebellar syndrome is also difficult to distinguish from other neurological disorders that result in similar degenerative symptoms such as ataxia and multiple sclerosis.  Research directions  There has been no gene or locus determined to cause vestibulocerebellar syndrome. Genes involved in central nervous system development or maintenance, however, may be considered as candidate genes. As of 2003, research is being done to investigate the potential role of these genes in vestibulocerebellar syndrome. Some possible candidate genes include, SOX21, ZIC2, and TYRP2. Genes that are part of the SOX family are expressed in the developing embryonic brain. Although no individuals have presented with brain abnormalities, it is possible that one of these candidate genes could have a more minor mutation, leading to the symptoms of vestibulocerebellar syndrome. TYRP2, for example, is important in the development of correct pigmentation; general and ocular albinism is associated with nystagmus. Since there is no anatomical correlations with this syndrome, failure of flocculus function is thought to be the cause of the eye movement abnormalities. Researchers surmise, therefore, that there exists a gene critical to establishing early eye movement control pathways.

They are notable for their pitchfork-shaped mandibles, which they use to capture millipedes of the order Polyxenida. The genus is a specialist predator of polyxenids, and one of only two ant genera known to prey upon polyxenids. Taxonomy and phylogenetics Head view of a Thaumatomyrmex mandibularis worker, showing its characteristic pitchfork- shaped mandibles The genus was established by Mayr in 1877 to house the single species Thaumatomyrmex mutilatus, discovered in Brazil. Since its inception, the genus has been placed in various tribes: Ectatommini, Ponerini, Cylindromyrmicini, and its own tribe, Thaumatomyrmecini. Molecular phylogeny by Schmidt & Shattuck (2014) confirmed that the genus is nested within Ponerini. Twelve species has been described, and a few undescribed taxa are known. Distribution Thaumatomyrmex is found only in the Neotropics, from Mexico to Brazil (including Cuba and other Caribbean islands). The genus was once thought to be rare, but with better sampling techniques, the ants are now found more frequently. Description Workers are small in size (3.3–5.0 mm) and have pitchfork-shaped mandibles with three long teeth. They are specialist predators of millipedes of the order Polyxenida. Polyxenids are an unusual type of prey, only known to be preyed upon by Thaumatomyrmex and Probolomyrmex ants. The millipedes are covered with hooked bristle setae, which entangles potential predators. Thaumatomyrmex use their long mandibles to hold the polyxenids before immobilizing them by stinging, and then stripping the prey from their protective setae. The brush-like hairs on the workers' legs are used to scrape the setae off \\"like cleaning a chicken\\".E. O.

When it occurs there is a sensation of rotation or movement that lasts for a few seconds before full seizure activity. While the specific causes of this disease are speculative there are several methods for diagnosis, the most important being the patient's recall of episodes. Most times, those diagnosed with vertiginous seizures are left to self-manage their symptoms or are able to use anti-epileptic medication to dampen the severity of their symptoms. Vertiginous epilepsy has also been referred to as Epileptic vertigo, Vestibular epilepsy, Vestibular seizures, and Vestibulogenic seizures in different cases, but vertiginous epilepsy is the preferred term.Nielsen, J. M., MD. \\"Tornado Epilepsy Simulating Ménière's Syndrome.\\" Neurology 9.11 (1959): 794. Neurology. Web. 23 Mar. 2014. . Signs and Symptoms The signs of vertiginous epilepsy often occur without a change in the subject’s consciousness so that they are still aware while experiencing the symptoms.Stern, John M. \\"Focal Vertiginous Epilepsy.\\" Atlas of Epilepsies. (2010): 463–465. Print. It is often described as a sudden onset of feeling like one is turning in one direction, typically lasting several seconds. Although subjects are aware during an episode, they often cannot remember specific details due to disorientation, discomfort, and/or partial cognitive impairment. This sensation of rotational movement in the visual and auditory planes is also known as a vertiginous aura (symptom), which can precede a seizure or may constitute a seizure itself.Benbadis, Selim. Wolters Kluwer Health. (2013): Web. 23 Mar. 2014. . Auras are a “portion of the seizure that occur before consciousness is lost and for which memory is retained afterwards.”Ottman, R. United States. NCBI. Autosomal Dominant Partial Epilepsy with Auditory Features. Seattle: University of Washington, 2007. Web. Auras can be focused in different regions of the brain and can thus affect different functions. Some such symptoms that may accompany vertiginous epilepsy include: *Auditory hallucination *Cognitive impairment *Motor activity *Ictal behavior *Limbic auras Many people tend to mistake dizziness as vertigo, and although they sound similar, dizziness is not considered a symptom of vertiginous epilepsy. Dizziness is the sensation of imbalance or floating, impending loss of consciousness, and/or confusion. This is different from vertigo which is characterized by the illusion of rotational movement caused by the “conflict between the signals sent to the brain by balance- and position-sensing systems of the body”.\\"Dizziness: Lightheadedness and Vertigo Topic Overview.\\" WebMD. N.p., 2 Jan 2013. Web. 23 Mar 2014. . History and Epidemiology Vertiginous epilepsy onset can happen between the ages of 4–50, although typically symptoms will begin occurring in adolescence or young adulthood. Research studies have shown no inclination for this disease between sexes. Example of Optokinetic Nystagmus Caloric reflex testing was developed and used for testing vestibular function of deaf children and in diagnosis of childhood vertigo. A man named Barany (1902) published the first monograph on vestibular nystagmus that recognized the clinical usefulness of caloric responses. Barany's theory of production of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in caloric testing remains as the accepted explanation along with the description of nystagmus created by rotation in both adults and infants. Barany's work would later influence a researcher named Galebsky that would help him conclude that semicircular canals were functional at birth for both calorization and rotation. His work would also confirm that the eyelid of a newborn is raised in response to a vestibular as well as an auditory stimulus. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Hughlings Jackson Jackson H., Diagnosis of epilepsy. Medical Times and Gazette 1879; 1:29. and W.R. Gowers Gowers WR., The borderlands of epilepsy. London: Churchill, 1907: 40–75. recognized that episodes of dizziness were a symptom of epilepsy.Kogeorgos, J., D.F. Scott, and M Swash. \\"Epileptic Dizziness.\\" British Medical Journal . 282. (1981): n. page. During this time, when epileptic symptoms were brought to the forefront of study, there was no distinction between dizziness and vertigo. Sir George Frederick (1868–1941), known for his work in pediatric rheumatoid arthritis referred to as Still’s disease, was the first to publish a description of episodic vertigo in children within the broad category of ‘headaches in children’ in 1924.Snashall S. The history of balance in children: a review. Audiological Medicine [serial online]. October 2009;7(3):132–137. Available from: CINAHL with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Until recently, it was not widely recognized that episodes of suspected dizziness might be caused by epilepsy. Causes and Mechanism Although a specific cause has not been identified to always induce vertiginous epilepsy there have been a number of supported hypotheses to how these seizures come about, the most common being traumatic injury to the head. Other causes include tumor or cancers in the brain, stroke with loss of blood flow to the brain, and infection. A less tested hypothesis that some believe may play a larger role in determining who is affected by this disease is a genetic mutation that predisposes the subject for vertiginous epilepsy. This hypothesis is supported by occurrences of vertiginous epilepsy in those with a family history of epilepsy. Labeled lobes of the brain. Observe the spatial relationship between lobes. Because the temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes are so close, electrical activity can easily travel between them. Vertiginous epilepsies are included in the category of the partial epilepsy in which abnormal electrical activity in the brain is localized. With current research, it is presumed that the most likely cause to produce vertigo are epilepsies occurring in the lateral temporal lobe. These abnormal electrical activities can either originate from within the temporal lobe or may propagate from an epilepsy in a neighboring region of the brain. Epilepsies in the parietal and occipital lobes commonly propagate into the temporal lobe inducing a vertiginous state. This electrical propagation across the brain explains why so many different symptoms may be associated with the vertiginous seizure. The strength of the electrical signal and its direction of propagation in the brain will also determine which associated symptoms are noticeable. Diagnosis The most important factor in diagnosing a patient with vertiginous epilepsy is the subject’s detailed description of the episode. However, due to the associated symptoms of the syndrome a subject may have difficulty remembering the specifics of the experience. This makes it difficult for a physician to confirm the diagnosis with absolute certainty. A questionnaire may be used to help patients, especially children, describe their symptoms. Clinicians may also consult family members for assistance in diagnosis, relying on their observations to help understand the episodes. Erbek, Seyra H., Selim S. Erbek, Ismail Yilmaz, Ozgal Topal, Nuri Ozgirgin, Levent N. Ozluoglu, and Fusun Alehan. \\"Vertigo in childhood: A clinical experience .\\" International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology. 70. (2006): 1547–1554. In addition to the description of the event, neurological, physical and hematologic examinations are completed to assist in diagnosis. For proper diagnosis, an otological exam (examination of the ear) should also be completed to rule out disorders of the inner ear, which could also be responsible for manifestations of vertigo.Choung, Yun- Hoon, Keehyun Park, Sung-Kyun Moon, Chul-Ho Kim, and Sang Jun RYu. \\"Various causes and clinical characteristics in vertigo in children with normal eardrums.\\" Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology. 67. (2003): 889–894. This may include an audiological assessment and vestibular function test. During diagnosis, history-taking is essential in determining possible causes of vertiginous epilepsy as well as tracking the progress of the disorder over time. Other means used in diagnosis of vertiginous epilepsy include: *Electroencephalography (EEG) *Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) *Positron emission tomography (PET) *Neuropsychological testing The EEG measures electrical activity in the brain, allowing a physician to identify any unusual patterns. While EEGs are good for identifying abnormal brain activity is it not helpful in localizing where the seizure originates because they spread so quickly across the brain. MRIs are used to look for masses or lesions in the temporal lobe of the brain, indicating possible tumors or cancer as the cause of the seizures. When using a PET scan, a physician is looking to detect abnormal blood flow and glucose metabolism in the brain, which is visible between seizures, to indicate the region of origin. Prevention and Management Watson-Crick double helix, genetics There is no real way to prevent against vertiginous episodes out of the means of managing the disease. As head trauma is a major cause for vertiginous epilepsy, protecting the head from injury is an easy way to avoid possible onset of these seizures. With recent advances in science it is also possible for an individual to receive genetic screening, but this only tells if the subject is predisposed to developing the condition and will not aid in preventing the disease. There are a range of ways to manage vertiginous epilepsy depending on the severity of the seizures. For simple partial seizures medical treatment is not always necessary. To the comfort of the patient, someone ailed with this disease may be able to lead a relatively normal life with vertiginous seizures. If, however, the seizures become too much to handle, antiepileptic medication can be administered as the first line of treatment. There are several different types of medication on the market to deter epileptic episodes but there is no support to show that one medication is more effective than another. In fact, research has shown that simple partial seizures do not usually respond well to medication, leaving the patient to self-manage their symptoms. A third option for treatment, used only in extreme cases when seizure symptoms disrupt daily life, is surgery wherein the surgeon will remove the epileptic region. Research There have been early and consistent strategies for measurement to better understand vertiginous epilepsy including caloric reflex test, posture and gait, or rotational experimentation. In Japan, Kaga et al prepared a longitudinal study of rotation tests comparing congenital deafness and children with delayed acquisition of motor system skills. They were able to demonstrate the development of post-rotation nystagmus response from the frequency of beat and duration period from birth to six years to compare to adult values. Overall, the study demonstrated that some infants from the deaf population had impaired vestibular responses related to head control and walking age. A side interpretation included the evaluation of the vestibular system in reference to matching data with age. Research in this area of medicine is limited due to its lacking need for urgent attention. But, the American Hearing Research Foundation (AHRF) conducts studies in which they hope to make new discoveries to help advance treatment of the disease and possibly one day prevent vertiginous seizures altogether.

He was the brother of Francesco d'Este who succeeded his father as Duke of Modena. As a boy, he undertook military study in Modena but left to answer an ecclesiastic calling. Early ecclesiastic career Little is known of his early Church career but he was elevated to cardinal by Pope Urban VIII at the request of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor in 1641 and this was published in the consistory of 16 December that year. However, the First War of Castro broke out between Barberini Pope Urban and the Farnese Dukes of Parma. As a result, Rinaldo d'Este refused to travel to Rome to receive his cardinal's hat.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Instead, when Pope Urban died in 1644, he travelled to Rome to participate in the Papal conclave which elected Pope Innocent X who then conducted the ceremony following his own Papal coronation. After Pope Innocent's election, though, d'Este had a falling out with members of the Spanish faction of the College of Cardinals who had been the driving force behind the Pope's election against candidates put forward by the French faction. After the falling out, d'Este declared himself for France. As a result, though his family had previously been in conflict with the Barberini, he became their ardent supporters while they were in exile in France. He returned to Modena and became temporary ruler when his brother left to fight the Spanish in 1647. Later he returned to Rome upon hearing that the Admiral of Castile was visiting as ambassador of the Kingdom of Spain. The Admiral, though, saw every cardinal except for d'Este on the grounds that d'Este had declared himself for France. The slight escalated and both the Admiral and Cardinal d'Este raised 600 men-at-arms each in preparation for armed conflict; d'Este having pawned jewels to hire militia as neither his family nor his French supporters had been able to raise funds quickly enough. Eventually, the conflict was quelled when Pope Innocent ordered his own troops to enter Rome to keep the peace, though several militiamen on both sides were killed. Later ecclesiastic career He was elected Bishop of Reggio Emilia in December 1650 and participated in the Papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII, the conclave of 1667, which elected Pope Clement IX and the conclave of 1669–1670, which elected Pope Clement X. At various times he returned to Modena to rule in his brother's absence, his nephew Rinaldo being too young to take his father's place. On 24 August 1671 he opted for the order of bishops and was appointed Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina. He died on 30 September 1672 in Modena.

Built in 1845-6, the existing stone structure is the oldest surviving church building in the state of Oklahoma and the oldest church congregation among the Choctaw nation. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The congregation was established in 1832, and the current stone church building was constructed in 1845–1846 with a cemetery established across the road. Buried in the cemetery is Alfred Wright, a physician and missionary to the Choctaw Native Americans. Wright translated many books into the Choctaw language, including the New Testament. Until the church building was completed, the services were held outdoors under a large oak tree. The congregation sat on logs placed in rows under the tree. Rev. Wright used an overturned 100-gallon barrel as his pulpit. He preached his first sermon there on December 9, 1832. In 1832 Wright also built a small log cabin church and a larger log house to accommodate the family. He added a large room to the latter, where his wife, Harriet Bunce Wright, and teacher Anna Burnham could teach local Choctaw children, using a day school format. This would continue until 1839, and would become the nearby Wheelock Academy, a boarding school, which the Choctaw Council sanctioned as a girls' seminary in 1842. =The stone church= The new building, soon called the \\"Stone Church,\\" was begun in 1845 and completed in 1846. Financed by donations and constructed by volunteer laborers (mostly Choctaw), it has -thick stone walls and a vaulted ceiling over the main floor and balcony. It is about in plan and its steeple rises to in height. A slogan favored by Rev. Wright, “Jehovah Jireh” (“the Lord will provide”) was carved into the gable and is said to be still legible. In 1866 the church was damaged by a fire that destroyed the mission to the east, and the church's roof was not restored until 1884. With . =The Wrights' deaths= Wright was often absent from the pulpit because, as the only person in the area trained in medicine, he would ride out to the home of any one who he heard was ill. However, this practice aggravated his own frail health. He suffered from bursitis, intermittent fevers and an undefined heart problem. He suffered his last attack and died on March 31, 1853. As he had requested earlier, his body was buried in the Wheelock cemetery. Harriet struggled to keep the mission and school operating, but her own health began failing about a year after Alfred's death. She had to leave Indian Territory and go back east to live with relatives. She died in Madison, Florida on Oct. 3, 1863, and was buried there. =Rev. John Edwards= The American Board of Missionaries sent Rev. John Edwards to replace Rev. Wright as Wheelock's superintendent, and John Libby as Edwards' assistant. In 1861, after the Choctaw Nation formally allied itself with the Confederate States of America, becoming a belligerent state in the American Civil War, the ABM ordered Edwards to leave Indian Territory and return to the North. Edwards traveled to San Francisco, California in 1861, where he taught for two years. He then moved to Oakland, California and served as supply minister for several churches for the next 20 years. In 1882, he returned to work among the Choctaws, first at Atoka, then at Wheelock, where he reopened the academy in 1884. He served as academy superintendent until 1895, when the Choctaw Nation took it over. In 1896, he returned to San Jose, California, where he remained until his death December 18, 1903. Final year Rev. Evan B. Evans came to Wheelock as the supply minister for one year in 1897. By that time, there were only 60 members, principally students at the school who lived some distance from Wheelock. The students were absent from church for much of the year, so services were discontinued at Wheelock at the end of the year.

Since 1981 he has composed, produced or arranged for artists as diverse as jazz vocalist Helen Merrill, composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, and DJ Towa Tei. During this time he has lived in London, Paris and Tokyo. Life and career =Early career= Shimizu’s career as a saxophone player took off in the 1970s. He released his first solo album, Get You, in 1978 and from 1980 won a following with his experimental rock band Mariah, with whom he released five albums. Mariah’s final recording Utakata no Hibi (1983) weaved traditional Japanese festival rhythms with rock tempos and sounds. Over the same period Shimizu recorded solo albums including IQ 179 (1981) and Kakashi (1982), which built on the alternative-music foundations set down by Mariah. From these beginnings Shimizu’s delight in pushing boundaries is apparent in such projects as the satellite link-up performance of Bye Bye Kipling with Ryuichi Sakamoto for a Nam June Paik happening (1986), or his enigmatic, solo “live installation” as a Human Cuckoo Clock in Tokyo (2002). =The Saxophonettes I= In 1983, he created the Yasuaki Shimizu & Saxophonettes project—initially a one-man band—which has since become the main focus of his recording activities. His first recording as the Saxophonettes was L'Automne à Pékin (1983), a tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood: classic soundtrack-flavored tunes rendered with a combination of lush yet minimal orchestration and layered electronic sounds laid over reggae bass and drums. This was followed by Stardust (1985), Latin (1991) and Time and Again (1993); the latter revisiting the textures of L'Automne à Pékin with original compositions highlighting Shimizu’s orchestral arrangements and his tenor saxophone. The Saxophonettes project released Shimizu’s landmark Cello Suites albums in 1996 (nos 1-3) and 1999 (nos 4-6). These were reissued in 2007 as a two-disc set (nos 1-6). =Europe= From 1985 through 1991 Shimizu divided his time between Paris and London, making his contribution to the multicultural and re- energized European music scene by recording, collaborating and performing with various international artists. His experiences over this period also gave him an altogether new perspective on his own musical roots. He made three albums: Subliminal (1987) with French producer Martin Meissonnier, Dementos (1988) with various British artists including ex-Flying Lizards David Cunningham, and Aduna (1989) with Senegalese vocalist Wasis Diop, whose 1994 album No Sant Shimizu co-produced. =Bach recordings= Shimizu has always paid meticulous attention to recording and studio techniques. In 1997 his mini-album Bach Box won the Best Production prize at the 39th annual Japan Record Awards. This recording, while expressing the highest respect for the baroque master, revisited Bach’s music with an audacious approach to form and flashes of wit, interweaving the original musical structures with treated voices and intermittent sine wave signals. On his Cello Suites projects Shimizu utilized unconventional acoustic environments, which he selected for their high degree of reverberation—an underground quarry, a mine in Japan, a palazzo in Italy—in order to “play the space” as a resonating instrument. This approach is also reflected in his \\"Bach-Saxophone-Space\\" concert series performed at such locations as Kodaiji Temple in Kyoto in 1996 (Osaka Shinbun 6 Dec 1996), the Niitsu, Genichiro-Inokuma and Mito art museums between 2000 and 2003, and an underground car park in Shibuya (Mainichi Daily Sept 1997), Tokyo (1997). =The Saxophonettes II= In 2006, Shimizu made his playful one-man-band concept of the Saxophonettes into a real-life quintet, featuring Ryoko Egawa, Hirokazu Hayashida, Ryota Higashi and Hiroshi Suzuki in an ensemble of three tenor and two baritone saxophones. Their album Pentatonica (2007) transcends genre limitations in a recording based on the five-note pentatonic scale. Featuring new compositions as well as arrangements of Ethiopian traditional music, it displays Shimizu's individuality: from his choice of recording locations and painstaking approach to sound production, to the immediacy of live performance conveyed through the interplay between musicians. Beyond recording, the group has performed extensively in Japan as well as in Moscow, Havana and Hong Kong, with other tours in the works. At a performance in Tokyo (2010) commissioned by Sumida Triphony Hall, Shimizu reaffirmed his passion for Bach by premiering the world’s first saxophone/contrabass arrangement of Bach's Goldberg Variations, adding four contrabasses to his saxophone quintet. He went on to hone the arrangement for release as the album Goldberg Variations in 2015. =Film and TV= Shimizu with his band Mariah has composed soundtracks for the anime series The New Adventures of Gigantor in 1980/1981. He created music for Juliet Berto's Havre (1985), Oscar-winner Yōjirō Takita’s We Are Not Alone (1993),Bokura wa minna ikiteiru (1993) - IMDb three films by Mitsuo Yanagimachi including most recently Who's Camus Anyway? (2006), and contributed a piece to Peter Greenaway's Pillow Book (1996). He also wrote the score for the Oscar-nominated and award-winning documentary Cutie and the Boxer (2013) by Zachary Heinzerling. He has composed soundtracks for Hiroyuki Nakano’s art video Issey Miyake Dancing Pleats (1993), the feature film Stereo Future (2000) and in 2008 the two short films Ferris Wheel at 3:03:15 PM, and Seven Samurai. The album Music for Commercials, a collection of his melodies aired as TV jingles, was released in 1987. He authored the “sound identity” for TV film channel Cinefil Imagica, then released an album of related tracks entitled Cinefil (2001). He wrote scores for a number TV dramas, plus a documentary and experimental film for the Japanese national broadcaster NHK TV. In 2007 NHK adopted his music for the educational series Mathematica II. His 2014 soundtrack to the dramatization of Ryu Murakami's Gojūgo-sai kara no Harōraifu (Finding Life After 55) was later released as an album. A major event in 2008 saw Shimizu compose music for a one-off screening of the newly restored 1925 silent film Orochi, a samurai “chambara” sword-fighting drama. He performed this “live soundtrack” with the Saxophonettes and a 23-piece orchestra inside the grounds of Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. He has worked with iconic Japanese comedian and director Hitoshi Matsumoto, scoring the films Symbol (2009) and Scabbard Samurai (2011). =Collaborations= Shimizu’s partnerships with video, multimedia, and dance artists include commissions for Mao Kawaguchi’s video installations La Cite Délire (1987) and Niwa (1992), the performances by butoh dancer Goro Namerikawa Kioku no Gekijo (1990) and Flaneur vol. 5 (1997), and the Simon James art installations Look Don't Touch (1998), and Chasing Light (2002). In 2004 he composed music for the sound installations featured in “Dream Garden Factory,” a landscape of six gardens with different themes at the Pacific Flora 2004 expo. Excerpts from the installation were released on the album Seventh Garden (2004). Between 2006 and 2007, his concerts with the Saxophonettes at venues in Tokyo and Osaka featured as guest artist the contemporary dancer Masako Yasumoto. In 2012 Shimizu collaborated with media artist Masaki Fujihata on his project Voices of Aliveness, a multimedia public recording, installation and performance for the Estuaire Biennale in Nantes, France. The work won the Award of Distinction at the Prix Ars Electronica. As a composer-producer-arranger, he has collaborated with artists as diverse as Japanese enka balladeer Saburo Kitajima, composers Ryuichi Sakamoto and Koji Ueno, jazz vocalists Helen Merrill and Karin Krog, guitarist Kazumi Watanabe, French pop singer Pierre Barouh, and DJ Towa Tei. He has also contributed to recordings by trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, DJ Dee Nasty, Björk and others. Live collaborations include appearances with Bill Laswell, Elvin Jones, Yosuke Yamashita, Van Dyke Parks, Urban Sax, Manu Dibango, David Cunningham and Carl Stone. From 1991 to 1994 he teamed up with ex-YMO artist Haruomi Hosono to produce the Tokyo Mura Mura Festival, presenting improbable line-ups of talents such as Michael Nyman, John Zorn, Julee Cruise, and The Orb.

Biography Kushchevsky was born in Barnaul, Siberia where his father was a minor official. He received his early education at the Tomsk gymnasium. He went to Saint Petersburg in the mid-1860s to study at the University, but had to leave school due to lack of money. He worked at odd jobs and lived in cheap boarding houses in the slums for several years. In 1870 he began writing sketches describing his experiences among the lower classes. In 1871 his only novel Nikolai Negorev; or, The Successful Russian, was serialized in Annals of the Fatherland. In the novel, Nikolai tells the story of his progress from age twelve to the beginning of what promises to be a solid career in the civil service. In the writing of Nikolai Negorev, Kushchevsky was strongly influenced by Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel What is to be Done?. Nikolai Negorev was highly praised by the democratic critics of the day. Kushchevsky wrote Nikolai Negorev between July and November 1870, at the age of 23, while he was sick and destitute in a hospital for the poor. He described the process of composing his novel: > \\"I was absorbed by my novel Negorev, and gave up all other work for it. I > soon found myself with nothing to eat. Luckily for me, I have been admitted > to hospital. Here I sell my rations in order to buy candles and I work away > on an empty stomach. But progress is slow. The evenings are dark and I > haven't money for all the candles I need.\\" Throughout his adult life he suffered from privation and alcoholism, which eventually contributed to his death at an early age.

The Caribbean island-nation of Cuba accepted the convention on March 24, 1981, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list; as of 2011, nine sites in Cuba are included. Cuba had its first site included on the list at the 6th Session of World Heritage Committee, held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, in December 1982. At that session, \\"Old Havana and its Fortifications\\", a site including the central, historic portion of the Cuban capital of Havana, as well as Spanish colonial fortifications, was inscribed on the list. Cuba's inclusions on the list include a variety of sites. Two sites are selected for their natural significance: Alejandro de Humboldt National Park in the eastern provinces of Holguín and Guantánamo, and Desembarco del Granma National Park, named for the yacht which carried the members of the 26th of July Movement who started the Cuban Revolution. City landscapes include Old Havana, Trinidad, and Camagüey, all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century. The sites also include historical agricultural regions, including the coffee plantations of southeastern Cuba, and the tobacco region of Viñales Valley.

The old city was built in the Baroque and Neoclassical styles. Historical landmarks in Old Havana include La Cabaña, the Cathedral of Havana and the Great Theatre of Havana. |- Trinidad and the Valley de los Ingenios |alt=A group of buildings with red roofs in the middle of green trees and hills. There is a taller building with a tower in the center. |Sancti Spíritus  |The city of Trinidad was founded in the early 16th century. In 1518, Hernán Cortés began his expedition to conquer Mexico from the port at Trinidad. The city prospered throughout the colonial period in large part due to the success of the local sugar industry. The adjacent Valley de los Ingenios was the origin of the Cuban sugar industry, which emerged in the 18th century. It is home to numerous cane sugar mills, as well as cattle ranches and tobacco plantations. |- San Pedro de la Roca Castle, Santiago de Cuba |alt=A series of walls made of stone sit on a hill that is above water. |Santiago de Cuba  |The large fort was built to defend the important port of Santiago de Cuba. The design of the fortification was based on Italian and Renaissance architecture. The complex of magazines, bastions, and batteries is one of the most complete and well-preserved Spanish-American defense fortifications. |- Desembarco del Granma National Park |150px |Granma  |The national park is named for the yacht which carried Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and the other 79 members of the 26th of July Movement to Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. The park features a unique karst topography with features such as terraces, cliffs, and waterfalls. |- Viñales Valley |alt=There is a field with tall grass and trees and a small wooden hut in the front, and steep cliffs in the back. |Pinar del Río  |The village of Viñales was founded in 1875 after the expansion of tobacco cultivation in the surrounding valley. The Valley features a karst topography, vernacular architecture, and traditional cultivation methods. The Valley was also the site of various military engagements in the Cuban War of Independence and Cuban Revolution. |- Archaeological Landscape of the First Coffee Plantations in the South-East of Cuba. |150px |Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo  |During the 19th and early 20th centuries, eastern Cuba was primarily involved with coffea cultivation. The remnants of the plantations display the techniques used in the difficult terrain, as well as the economic and social significance of the plantation system in Cuba and the Caribbean. |- Alejandro de Humboldt National Park |alt=Tall green trees and hills are on both sides of a river in the center. |Holguín and Guantánamo  |The rivers that originate in the high elevations are among the largest of the Insular Caribbean. The park exhibits a wide array of geology types. It contains many biological species, including 16 of Cuba's 28 endemic plant species, as well as animal species such as the endangered Cuban solenodon. |- Historic Centre of Cienfuegos |alt=A building with yellow walls has two towers of different heights with round red roofs. There are bells in the tallest tower. |Cienfuegos  |Cienfuegos was founded in 1819 as a Spanish colony, though its first inhabitants were French immigrants. It became a trade center in the sugar cane, tobacco, and coffee trade because of its location on the Cienfuegos Bay. Because of its establishment in the later colonial period, the architecture has more modern influences: including modern ideas of urban planning. |- Historic Centre of Camagüey |alt=There is a large stone building in the center with a tall tower. Behind are several smaller buildings with red roofs. |Camagüey  |Camagüey is among the first seven villages founded by the Spanish in Cuba, first settled in 1528. The irregular organization of the city is distinct from the typical, orderly construction of most other Spanish settlements. This maze-like style was influenced by medieval European ideas and traditional construction methods of early immigrant masons and construction workers. |} =Tentative list= In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage list, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage list are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.

The thirteenth child of a solicitor's copyist, he attended school in Hradec Králové, then in 1868 travelled to Prague to begin a career in retail. He worked for several companies, from 1873 for the publisher Otto-Verlag, for whom he became a courtroom reporter. From 1876 to 1878 he edited the satirical magazine Paleček; in 1882 he founded his own, Švanda dudák, which he edited almost continuously until 1930. He worked for several years at a law firm before becoming, in 1885, editor of the Národní listy, for which he had been an administrator. From 1888 he was chairman of the \\"May Society\\" of Czech authors (Májovci). He edited the first edition (1892-4) of the complete works of Jan Neruda. His literary work was closely tied to his journalism, and mostly dealt with the personalities and life of Prague. His first novel was the partly autobiographical U snědeného krámu (1890). The same year he wrote a play, Manželova přítelkyně, but it was not successful. He wrote several serial novels like Páté přes deváté and Muž bez třináctky. In Národní listy he published his most successful novel Otec Kondelík a ženich Vejvara (1898) as well as the sequel Tchán Kondelík a zeť Vejvara (1906).

He is an NCIS Special Agent in Charge, and the senior agent assigned to the Office of Special Projects. He first appeared in the NCIS season six episode \\"Legend (Part I)\\".  Background  Before working at NCIS, Callen previously worked for the CIA, DEA and FBI. Several episodes across the seasons reference his stint with the Agency and in seasons one and two, it is revealed that whilst with the CIA, Callen worked alongside recurring NCIS character, Trent Kort (David Dayan Fisher), and was partnered with Tracy Rosetti (Marisol Nichols). As part of their undercover mission in Uzbekistan, Callen and Tracy \\"married\\", using the surname Keller. Following this mission, where Callen accused Tracy of placing the success of the operation above both their professional and personal partnerships, the two 'divorced', with Callen joking that in the settlement Tracy received custody of Buddy, their dog. The marriage and subsequent divorce were of course fake. In season one, Callen is revealed to have worked with the DEA (on a joint operation with the CIA, where he first met Arkady Kolchek) and the FBI. Callen once served with his good friend Leroy Jethro Gibbs, who now works at the NCIS Headquarters located in the Washington Navy Yard. Callen specializes in deep undercover work. Prior to the series commencing, G. Callen and Sam Hanna had been partnered for two years (as per the season three episode \\"Partner\\") where they celebrate their five-year partnership. G. Callen grew up in foster care, never knowing who his parents were or even his first name. In the show's first episode \\"Identity\\", it is revealed that he is called \\"G\\" not because he dislikes his first name, but because he does not actually know what it stands for, as the system never told him. Further insights into his childhood come in season one's \\"Pushback\\", where Hetty Lange and operational psychologist Dr. Nate Getz discuss how Callen lived in thirty-seven foster homes from the age of five to the age of eighteen, sometimes moving every few days. The longest he ever stayed in one place was for three months at fourteen, when he lived with the family of a Russian girl named Alina Rostoff (whom he called \\"little sister\\"). A flashback in the finale of season one forces Callen to recall he had an older sister who unfortunately died by drowning in a river. She was buried with the name of Hannah Lawson, whilst the real Hannah lived with the assumed name of her dead foster friend, Amy Callen. It has not yet been revealed why the two siblings were split up and sent to opposite sides of America, although it can be assumed this was on instruction of their father, in order to keep them safe from the Comescu family. Callen's childhood was fraught with abuse which is referenced during various episodes. He readily identifies with characters who share a similar upbringing, understanding why kids join gangs or the military and knows exactly where runaway teens gather in LA. In season one (\\"Keeping It Real\\") he recalls that he once watched his foster father beat his foster brother to death. In season four, he shares how moving unexpectedly to a new home that wasn't quite so nice, made him close off his feelings. Callen also reassured a teenager that if you sleep well on the first night, it's a good home (season four, \\"Purity\\"). In \\"Reznikov.N\\" (season five), Callen tells Kensi and Deeks that when he was ten, his foster father used to beat him with a broom handle. He was moved after a few weeks not because he was abused, but because he decided to smack his foster father over the head with the same weapon. During the season six episode \\"Rage,\\" an undercover operation in prison sees him encounter a youth whose situation causes him to recall his troubled teenage years. Callen ran away from his last foster family, was arrested for robbing a storage locker and sent to a juvenile detention center, which he described as hell. After three weeks he escaped, stole a car, crashed it and was re-arrested, only to be rescued on the street from the police by Hetty. Over the course of the seasons, Callen has discovered more about his identity and flashbacks in the season two finale prompted him to suddenly recall that he spent part of his early childhood on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. He also uncovers repressed memories of witnessing his mother being assassinated in front of him when he was four. Early in season three, Hetty finally tells Callen that she knew his mother, Clara and she was her CIA handler. Callen's maternal line back to his grandfather George Callen is revealed, as well as the Romanian blood feud between the Callens and the Comescus. George Callen was OSS (which later became the CIA) and hunted Romanian war criminals after WWII and killed Comescus. He then married a Romanian girl, they had a daughter and returned to the US. A number of years later, Clara Callen undertook a CIA mission in Romania, unfortunately allowing the Comescus to exact their revenge on George Callen's daughter. \\"Reznikov. N\\", the show's 100th episode, was a landmark in Callen's journey of self- discovery. Until then the identity of his father was unknown but the Comescus track down and kidnap a man named Michael Reinhardt, painting a message in blood on the wall of Reinhardt's house, that they have his father. At gunpoint, Reinhardt tells Callen his name is Nikita Reznikov and with his dying breath says to tell him he kept his promise (to keep track of Callen – and presumably his sister). An archive search found Nikita Aleksandr Reznikov was a Russian Major in the KGB, who was arrested in 1974 and sent to the Gulag for helping families escape to the West. While his friends address him as \\"G\\", Hetty refuses to do so, saying, \\"It's not a name, it's a letter.\\" She instead addresses him as \\"Mr. Callen\\" (\\"Identity\\"). Once he discovers his full name, Hetty still calls him \\"Mr. Callen\\" rather than Grisha. The rest of the team continue to refer to him as Callen, as does his sister. Only his father calls him Grisha. In addition to English, Callen is fluent in at least six other languages: Spanish, Polish, Russian, German (which is claimed to be Austrian), Italian (with a Northern accent), and French. Callen also claims to speak Czech and Romanian; furthermore, his Russian is arguably good enough to be taken for one, but not the other, Chechen dialect. That fluency allowed Callen to infiltrate a Chechen terrorist cell in the season four episode \\"The Chosen One\\" which eerily presaged the Boston Marathon bombing by Chechen immigrants less than three months later. The fake death certificate shown by Hetty to Alexa Comescu in the season-two finale states that his date of birth is March 11, 1970. In the Season 1 episode \\"Search and Destroy\\" (S1:E4), Callen is shown easily reading Arabic, with enough fluency to translate on the fly into idiomatic English. In \\"Archangel\\", Callen states that the first time he fired a gun was at the age of 20. In the same episode, it was revealed that Hetty has beaten him on a race up the NCIS rock wall three times in a row, and Callen refuses to challenge her to a re-match despite goading from Sam Hanna. Earlier flashbacks in the season two finale saw Callen suddenly remember that he spent part of his early childhood on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. As an adult, his foster-sister Rostoff was secretly sent to watch Callen and to prevent him from being killed by Russian mobsters. Callen is fluent in Russian due to his former relationship with the Rostoff family. Throughout the first season, it is shown that Callen is homeless, staying temporarily with his various NCIS colleagues and sometimes in the Operations Center itself.  Storylines  = NCIS season 6 = At the end of \\"Legend\\", Callen was almost killed in a drive-by shooting. Callen and the team later realized (in the first-season episode \\"Pushback\\") that his shooting was related to a mission Callen took part in against the Russian Mob, as a DEA agent ten years earlier. = Season 1 = In the first-season finale \\"Callen, G.\\", Callen tracks down a woman named Amy Taylor (née Callen) who initially claims to be his older sister, but then admits her real name is actually Hannah Lawson, and that she was friends with the real Amy Callen when they lived in an orphanage together. The real Amy had died at the age of 11 when the two friends sneaked out at night to play in the nearby river, and Amy had been swept away in an accident. When Hannah returned, she slept in Amy's bed, and the authorities there never realized what had happened. When Amy's body was found a month later, she was buried under Hannah's name as the authorities didn't know any better. Callen later goes to visit his sister's grave, and finds flowers and a recent note left \\"For my Sweet daughter always in my Heart\\". Also during the episode, Nate Getz discovers that a list of all of Callen's foster homes and orphanages was written by one person, albeit over a number of years, indicating that someone had been keeping an eye on Callen during that time. The same list showed the various orphanages and foster homes where the real and fake Amy, including the last foster home where Amy (aka Hannah) stayed for many years, indicating this person did not know about the switch between Hannah and Amy. In season 3 \\"Deadline\\", Callen discovers that Hetty had kept an eye on him during his youth (confirmed in season 6 \\"Rage\\"), and also knew his sister died. But in season 5's \\"Reznikov, N.\\" it is revealed that Hans Schreiber also kept track of Callen's life, as a favor to Callen's father. It has not been confirmed who actually wrote the list of foster homes and orphanages however it is assumed that he wrote the list as Nate Getz analysed the list as having been written with an aging hand, as and when the changes of homes took place. = Season 2 = In the season two premiere \\"Human Traffic\\", Hetty makes arrangements for Callen to purchase a house of his own—the very same house where he lived with Alina Rostoff as a foster child. The second season mostly revolves around Callen, who has been stalked by someone he does not know. He sees someone near the grave of his sister, and over the course of the season, runs into people who seem to know more about his past than he does. When Hetty resigns and takes off to Prague, Callen finds out from Director Vance that Hetty has started her own investigation, Operation Comescu, which is all about Callen. Callen and the team then resign too when Vance refuses to fly them to Prague to get Hetty. Arriving in Prague, the team discovers that Hetty has been taken by the Comescus and that the Comescus have been in a decades-long blood feud with the Callens, of which G is the last one. The team tracks their safe house down to a house on the beach, and Callen starts to remember things from his past, as he realizes he has been on this beach before. Inside the house, Hetty fails to convince Alexa Comescu, the matriarch of the Comescu family, that Callen died three weeks ago, showing her a clip of the attempted assassination and a death certificate. = Season 3 = In the third-season premiere, \\"Lange, H.\\", it is revealed that Callen's grandfather was an OSS agent stationed in Romania. In the third-season episode number 4 \\"Deadline\\", Hetty Lange reveals to Callen that his grandfather was named George Callen and that he parachuted into Romania during the War, and at the end took part in hunting those guilty of war crimes, he subsequently found and killed several members of the Comescu family. In 1947 he met and married a 'Romanian Girl' (Callen's grandmother, name unknown). George Callen was murdered by the Comescu family. The remainder of Callen's family (his grandmother and her daughter, Callen's mother, Clara) fled to America where years later Clara was recruited by the CIA. She returned to Romania and then a year later vanished for six years. The Comescu family had not forgotten their grudge and came looking for the Callens. One of Callen's most vivid memories of his childhood is of being given a toy soldier by a stranger while he played on the beach. He realizes that the beach is not in California as he had always assumed, but on the Black Sea coast, and that the toy was given to him to distract him while a Comescu assassin killed his mother. It is never explained why the Comescu family let Callen and his sister live, though Alexa Comescu describes it as \\"a mistake\\". Callen confronts Alexa, both holding guns on each other, and Alexa claims to know everything about him. Her words persuade him to lower his weapon providing Alexa the opportunity she needs to kill the last Callen. Before she can pull the trigger, Hunter shoots her dead. Back in LA, Hunter is the acting Operations Manager until Hetty returns to work after sustaining a gunshot during Operation Comescu. Callen does not trust Hunter and wants to know more about himself and what was on the laptop that she retrieved at the Comescu house. Hunter later tells him that all the contents of the laptop were concerning the family's illegal activities and not about Callen. Hetty later returns when Hunter leaves for another undercover operation in Europe and offers to tell Callen everything starting with the reason she was trying to protect him: she had failed to protect his mother. She then gives him his mother's name: Clara. She also tells him that his mother was a CIA agent and that Hetty had been her handler when Clara had gone back on assignment to Romania. After a year of the mission, Clara vanished for six years and resurfaced with two children, desperate to get out of Romania. Hetty had been sent to meet her on the beach where the Comescus killed her. She also says that she doesn't know how he and his sister came to the U.S. and that she had no idea who his father is but that she was the one responsible for getting him out of the orphanage and into foster homes. In the third-season finale, \\"Sans Voir\\", Agent Mike Renko and former Operations Manager Lauren Hunter are both murdered at the hands of Marcel Janvier, also known as \\"The Chameleon\\". Callen appears to gun down Janvier following a prisoner exchange. The episode ends with Callen being arrested by LAPD and Hetty resigning her position at OSP. = Season 4 = A series of flashbacks in the season four opening episode \\"Endgame\\" reveal that Janvier's death was faked. After Janvier and Callen are traded back to their respective sides in a prisoner exchange, Callen—following his fake suspension—returns to lead the OSP team once again. Janvier returns again at the end of season 4. = Season 5 = In the season 5 opener, Janvier reminds Callen that he will be seeking his revenge, even if he has to wait many years to exact it. In the season five episode \\"Reznikov, N.\\", a man named Michael Reinhardt appears. Reinhardt claims that his true name is Nikita Alexsandr Reznikov and that he is Callen's father. He is kidnapped and killed by one of the surviving members of the Comescu family, Vasile. At the end of the episode, Hetty and Arkady Kolcheck explain to Callen that the real Reznikov was a KGB major who was arrested and sent to a Soviet gulag in 1974, around the time Callen and his sister came to America. Reinhardt (actually named Hans Schreiber) was a former East German who owed Reznikov a favor and repaid it by keeping track of Callen and his sister. The Comescus mistook him for Reznikov, who kept up the ruse to protect Callen. In Reinhardt's house, Deeks discovered an 8 mm film of Callen and Amy playing with Reznikov. Hetty gave it to Callen. In \\"War Cries\\", Sam, Michelle, and Hetty set Callen up on a blind date with Joelle Taylor, a friend of the Hannas and their daughter's former kindergarten teacher. Both aware of the trick, they nevertheless get on well although Callen immediately makes up a fake career to protect his role. Throughout season five, Joelle is mentioned as Callen's girlfriend. = Season 6 = In \\"Humbug\\", an armed robber threatens Joelle in public after stealing some malware from a defense contractor. When it is learned that the robber placed the stolen malware on Joelle, Callen is forced to put himself in danger to protect her, eventually being forced to reveal to her that he is an NCIS agent. Although she appears hurt by this revelation of Callen's deception, she eventually accepts to continue their relationship as long as he tells her more about himself. Callen and Joelle are confirmed to be still together by both Sam and Callen himself. Callen later tells the team he would not be against starting a family with Joelle. Callen realises Arkady Kolchek knows more about his father than he's revealed. When a mission to find a ship with stolen barrels of oil leads to Russia, Arkady accompanies the team. Whilst there, Arkady takes Callen to a coffee shop and shows him a photo of Callen's father (Reznikov) from the 1980s, long after he was supposedly sent to the Gulag. Through Eric's hacking, Hetty discovers that Reznikov took the name of Chernoff. Callen realises he was working in Moscow at the same time his father frequented the city. = Season 7 = In season seven, Callen admits that he and Joelle are fighting a lot. They break up off screen but still spend Christmas together to avoid being lonely. In \\"Matryoshka, Part 2\\", Callen meets Reznikov in Russia. He reveals that Callen's birth name is Grisha Aleksandrovich Nikolaev, but has to leave before he could find out any more information. Callen has since updated his personnel records and credentials with his full name. = Season 8 = Callen reunites with Reznikov in \\"Glasnost\\", where he shoots a man who went after a woman victim he was visiting and reveals he had been in touch with Arkady Kolcheck since the Russia incident back in Season Seven. Callen interrogates his father, who admits he's in LA for work—not to see his son. After Hetty takes over the interrogation, she allows Reznikov to escape to finish what he started. Callen and Sam go to his rescue, and Callen discovers that Reznikov helped a woman move to the U.S. and fathered a child with her. That child has since become a parent, so Callen has a half-sister and is now an uncle. In the episode \\"Payback\\", Callen learns from Hetty that Joelle is an undercover CIA agent who has been assigned by rogue agency moles to spy on him. Feeling betrayed, Callen permanently severs his ties with Joelle.

The film is based on a story written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair named Cheriya Cheriya Bhookambangal. The movie was produced by P. V. Gangadharan under the banner of Gruhalakshmi Productions and was distributed by Kalpaka Release Plot The story revolves around Janakikutty (Jomol), a ninth grade student and the challenges she faces in her everyday life. She is basically a lonely girl, who finds no peace at home and is constantly scolded by her elders or teased by her siblings and cousins. Her only companions are her grandmother (Valsala Menon) and her neighbor, Bhaskaran (Sharath), whom she loved secretly. One day, when Janakikutty and her grandmother were collecting herbs in a nearby forest, she accidentally wanders off to the restricted area of the forest. Her grandmother warns her never to go there again, because it was a cursed area. She narrates the legend behind it. Years ago, that area was once occupied by a newly wed Namboothiri couple. The wife, Kunjathol, later found out that her husband was a womanizer. When she objected, her husband murdered her. Since then, Kunjathol, now a Yakshi, is believed to be haunting that place, along with her associate Karineeli, another Yakshi, intent on killing any vicious men and drinking their blood who passed that very area. To prove this story true, her grandmother narrated another story. Once, two men lost their way while attending a nearby festival. A young woman then came up to them and asked them if they could give her a few betel leaves to chew. To their horror, it was none other than Kunjathol herself, who then killed them and drank their blood. Their bones were found the next day under a tree. One day, Janakikutty happenes to come across Bhaskaran and her cousin Sarojini (Rashmi Soman), who are actually having an affair. This upsets her and she runs home in tears, but in between, sprains her leg and falls to the ground. Suddenly, a voice calls out her name. She encounters Kunjathol (Chanchal), a beautiful young woman, who comes to her with a lovable smile and introduces herself and her aide, Karineeli. She also says that since Janakikutty didn't commit any sin, she would instead like to befriend her and protect her. Since then, Janakikutty and Kunjathol become best friends, where Kunjathol helped Janakikutty whenever she needed. In the meantime, Janakikutty's family is worried over her strange behavior. Occasionally, they would see her conversing with herself or talk rudely to elders. At the same time, an unseen force vandalizes the household. They believe that the ghost of Kunjathol must be haunting them. They conduct a number of rituals, but to no avail. Later, Sarojini's marriage is to be conducted. However, she is against it because she already loved someone else. Janakikutty decides to help her with Kunjathol's aid. However, when Janakikutty approached Kunjathol, she refuses, telling that everyone must live according to their destiny and changing it is not easy.

She is a Junior Field Agent in the NCIS Office of Special Projects Team stationed in Los Angeles. She first appeared in the NCIS season six episode \\"Legend (Part I)\\".  Casting  Kensi was originally named \\"Kensi Lo\\" and described as \\"a twenty-something Asian-American whose academic record in Forensics and Criminology got her recruited young by the Feds\\"; a change was necessitated when Portuguese actress Daniela Ruah was cast. Like G. Callen, Sam Hanna, Eric Beale and Nate Getz, Kensi was first introduced in the backdoor pilot \\"Legend\\" from NCIS.  Background  = Personal background = Kensi Marie Blye was born in San Diego, California. She came from a U.S. Marine Corps family and still drives to Camp Pendleton every weekend. At some point her father was stationed at Camp Lejeune during her childhood. She is fluent in Portuguese, French, and Spanish, can lip-read and knows Morse code. In the episode \\"Borderline\\" she also stated that her father taught her how to \\"track, shoot, fix an engine, play poker, wire a house; basically anything you teach a son\\", and that her father was her best friend. In that same scene she reveals that her \\"father didn't have any sons, just me\\" implying that she is an only child. She has admitted to having Chaetophobia (fear of hair), specifically fear of men's back hair. She collects gel bracelets and is known to have at least seventy-two. She is also known to be a slob; her desk is frequently covered in clutter and her home is shown to be quite messy. Her untidy habits are a recurring joke throughout the series. When she was fifteen years old and out seeing the movie Titanic with friends, a movie Kensi considers to be her favorite, her father was murdered. His body was so unrecognizable that he had to be identified through the use of dental records. It had been a cold case for many years, but in the episode \\"Blye, K., Part 2\\" it was finally solved and Kensi was able to move on with her life at last. It was subsequently revealed that after her father's murder, she spent almost a year living on the streets. = Professional background = Kensi joined the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in August 2003, according to her NCIS agent biography form from \\"Black Market\\" after having graduated from Cornell University with a BA in Politics and International Studies. According to the form, her first posting was the Washington DC Office, December 2006 to September 2007, then Tokyo 7th Fleet HQ from October 2007 to March 2008. After that she was stationed at Norfolk Naval Base, Virginia from March 2008 to June 2009. She started at OSP in Los Angeles in June 2009. In \\"The Only Easy Day\\", Kensi says that when she was the new girl, she had to climb through air ducts because she was the smallest, and also had to wear bikinis on assignment when needed. She is very talented with undercover work, and Callen and Sam have called her a \\"natural operator\\". She is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, English, and French.  Storylines  = Season 1 = On-screen, her first partner was Agent Dom Vail. She was particularly upset when Dom went missing and she was seen afterwards washing dishes at his apartment. Kensi has been officially partnered with Marty Deeks since season two, although their first experience working together was in the season one episode \\"Fame\\". = Season 2 = It is revealed in the season two episode \\"Disorder\\" that she was once engaged to a Marine named Jack, but that their relationship ended after his return from Iraq suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his subsequent disappearance. Kensi tried to be there for him (stating that she helped with his medication, and even went to his psychiatric appointments), but all of her efforts weren't enough since Jack was too affected. It is said that he eventually left her without even telling her. She is even shown crying in the interrogation room to the suspect (proving that she obviously had a deep connection to him, and is still greatly affected by the loss). Although Deeks and Kensi have a somewhat antagonistic relationship at first, they have warmed up considerably over time, and she was visibly concerned when Deeks was shot in the episode \\"Personal\\". Kensi asks Hetty if she can stay with Deeks in the hospital rather than assist in the investigation of his shooting, as she didn't want to risk not seeing him alive again, as had happened with Vail. Deeks is also a flirter and he has demonstrated some interest in Kensi on a personal level. In the episode \\"The Job\\", while undercover, she had to flirt with a good-looking thief. Deeks showed jealousy, as noted by Callen and Sam. Kensi is visibly annoyed sometimes when Deeks flirts with other women or when he attempts to use her as a wingman. During some episodes, though, Kensi appears slightly jealous when Deeks flirts with other women or when they come across someone he once had feelings for while undercover. Over time it becomes obvious that Kensi is developing feelings for Deeks, though she often hides them. Like Deeks, Kensi also has a comic book collection. In the season two episode \\"Plan B\\" Kensi earns the nickname Wikipedia for her encyclopedic knowledge. In the season two finale, Kensi resigns from NCIS along with Callen and Sam in order to follow Hetty's trail to Prague without Director Vance's authorization. = Season 3 = In the season three episode \\"Blye, K.\\", Kensi falls under investigation when Marines from her dead father's sniper unit end up dead in various car accidents. Kensi's father Donald Blye was part of a special operations unit named \\"Oscar-Sierra\\". She is taken into custody by Assistant Director Granger when it is revealed that she was the last person a few Marines contacted before their deaths, although her name is eventually cleared when it becomes apparent that the true killer is a former member of her father's sniper unit who faked his own death. In season four, Hetty tells Deeks that Kensi lived on the streets for about a year after her father's death. This event appears to have scarred her emotionally, although she has never gone into details as to the events that took place while on the streets. In \\"Blye, K., Part 2\\", it is revealed that her mother (remarried as Julia Feldman) lives in Encino and they haven't spoken in 15 years. In the same episode, it is revealed that Kensi joined NCIS in 2006, nine years after the death of her father. She was 24 years old at the time. Granger accuses Kensi of joining NCIS to fulfill her own agenda, i.e. to investigate her father's death. Donald Blye died trying to protect an American journalist named Brad Stevens who was about to expose Peter Clairemont (chief of the Oscar-Sierra unit) who had killed a civilian while intoxicated. At the end of the episode, much to Kensi's surprise, it was revealed that her father and Granger were close associates. Kensi also has an affinity for Dubstep and techno music. Deeks mentions it early on in season three and she is found listening to it while undercover in episode 22 of season three, \\"Neighborhood Watch\\". Kensi also made a guest appearance in the Hawaii Five-0 episode \\"Ka Hakaka Maika'i\\" where she announced that she has Level 5 security clearance. = Season 4 = In the episode \\"Parley\\", while Deeks is undercover with a woman named Monica, Kensi appears jealous of how close Monica is to him. While Kensi is preparing Monica for a meeting with an arms dealer, Monica asks whether being Deeks' partner is enough for her. Kensi seems uptight and tries to avoid answering the question. Monica then goes on to tell her that he can't be trusted; Kensi defends Deeks by saying \\"I trust him with everything\\". Later Kensi goes to talk to Deeks and he asks her if she is good. She replies by saying she is good and asks Deeks the same question. He replies by saying \\"I'm good if you're good\\". Though they both say everything is fine between them, they both seem to be lying and are obviously not fine. By the end of the season, Deeks and Kensi finally begin to confront their true feelings for each other and share their first real kiss. = Season 5 = In this season, Kensi and Deeks finally begin to truly confront their romantic feelings for each other, but face various obstacles that continue to keep them apart or discuss their true feelings. In the opening episode of season five, Kensi is both comforted and deeply affected by the fact that Deeks used her as a tether to withstand the torture he had endured. While Deeks is recovering, Kensi states that she attempted to bring him his favorite doughnut/croissant (a.k.a. \\"Cronut\\"). She is clearly distraught by his lack of response, even to this gesture. After Nate is called to assess Deeks' mental status, it is Kensi who is finally able to give him the sleep he has thus far been unable to attain, when she goes to visit him at his house. In the episode \\"Recovery\\", it is implied that Kensi and Deeks have become intimate after he told her he wanted to be with her at his apartment and she stared at him before walking off, with him following right behind her. However, following their night together in the episode \\"Frozen Lake\\", things become awkward and full of tension when their entangled emotions begin to have an effect on their performance during field work. When Deeks does not take a most-needed shot, Kensi becomes agitated and tells Deeks she is standing on a \\"frozen lake\\" and that while she wants what they have more than anything else, it just won't work. Despite this, at the end of the episode, Kensi tells Deeks they'll find a way to work things out between them, admitting they have a \\"thing\\", before asking him to be patient with her as they talk things through. He agrees to that and they make plans to meet again that night. As Kensi waits for Deeks later on, though, Hetty tells her she has been reassigned to a new and classified mission and will have to leave until the job is finished, much to her disappointment. As she prepares to leave, she receives a text message from Deeks saying he is almost there. She appears genuinely upset and walks off. In Afghanistan, she receives her mission: to kill an American man who uses the alias \\"White Ghost\\". She discovers that the \\"White Ghost\\" is apparently Jack Simon, her ex-fiancé. Simon had PTSD returning from the war and left her on Christmas morning (season two \\"Disorder\\"). Because of her personal connection, she is unable to kill him and eventually gets captured. It is revealed that this was a plan crafted by Hetty to protect Jack, who is innocent, from the CIA. When the team hears news of Kensi's capture they rush to her aid, only to find her pale, weak and having been very severely beaten. This is a direct parallel to what Deeks went through at the beginning of season five. Kensi prefers not to talk about it, although she does confide in Deeks and he embraces her when she says \\"It was really bad.\\" (The Afghanistan storyline was actually not originally part of the plan for season 5, but added to keep Blye on the show despite actress Ruah's pregnancy.) = Season 6 = In season six episode 11 \\"Humbug\\", she and Deeks agree to make their relationship official and finally become a couple. They attempt to keep their relationship secret until the events of episode 18 \\"Fighting Shadows\\" when the team reveal their awareness of their newfound romantic relationship. In the same episode, Kensi and Deeks are also briefly separated and must work with Callen and Sam respectively, but later discover the reason being that Deeks is under investigation by the LAPD who will try and use their relationship against them. = Season 7 = In season seven, Kensi decides to move in with Deeks. Towards the end of the season, Callen, Sam, Kensi and Deeks go to the desert to capture a terrorist and their plane gets shot down and in the wreckage Kensi gets stuck under the nose of the plane and goes into a coma. The aftermath of the injury results in a spinal cord injury with a very slim chance of recovery. = Season 8 = For the first half of the season Kensi is out of action in hospital, recovering and doing therapy following her accident. After months of physical therapy she does eventually return to work, once Hetty and Nate both agree she is ready. In episode 14, Kensi is kidnapped by a man she met in physical therapy. In episode 15, she is taken to a house where the man threatens to cut off her leg but Deeks saves her. At the end of the season finale, Kensi asks Deeks to marry her and he says yes. = Season 9 = In season nine, Kensi and Deeks are officially engaged and begin planning for the wedding while at the same time meet Executive Assistant Director, Shay Mosley who replaces Owen Granger. Mosley is shown to disapprove of Kensi and Deeks' relationship when she sends Deeks back to work at the LAPD, temporarily breaking their partnership until Callen convinces Mosley to keep Deeks on the team. Throughout the season, Kensi and Deeks continue making plans and preparations for their wedding and at the same time, start discussing their future together beyond NCIS with Deeks expressing his hopes of someday leaving with Kensi to start a family together. During the season, Kensi is faced in a deadly and highly dangerous situation involving a nuclear launch and almost risking her life. Kensi is successful in stopping the threat. In the season nine finale, Kensi along with the rest of the team, learn the truth about Mosley's kidnapped son and Callen's promise to help her when they come into contact with a suspect on a current case who is connected to Mosley's former lover, Spencer Williams. Upon learning of this information, Mosley sees this as her best chance of finding and getting her son back. Mosley and the team learn they are located in Mexico, but the mission to rescue her son is unsanctioned and highly dangerous, putting the team's lives at risk. Kensi wishes to go to Mexico, but Deeks has concerns and does not believe it is a good idea. When Deeks is fired by Mosley after confronting her about her unfair, reckless and disrespectful behaviour, he believes that now is the time for him and Kensi to finally leave NCIS. However, despite their previous discussions on the matter, Kensi reveals that she is not ready to leave NCIS or start a family yet. A fight ensues between them, resulting in the wedding being called off. Despite being fired as well as the current state of their relationship, Deeks still joins the team on the Mexico mission to save Mosley's son. However, while the mission is ultimately successful, reuniting Mosley with her son and returning them to L.A. together, the rest of the team are struck by a rocket while escaping in their SUV, leaving uncertain who is dead or alive. = Season 10 = Shortly after the events from the season nine finale, Kensi and the team are revealed to have survived the impact from the rocket that hit their SUV. Kensi is the least injured member of the team, but becomes extremely worried when Deeks has since remained unconscious following the SUV explosion. The team are forced to separate and Kensi drags an unconscious Deeks through the desert to find safety and shelter, but Kensi continues to remain worried about Deeks. Eventually, Deeks awakens and Kensi manages to get to a hospital. Kensi reunites with Turk and together they stand guard and get ready for a fight from Spencer Williams men who are still hunting the team. Thankfully, help arrives and Kensi remains by Deeks' side as he is being treated from his injuries. By the end of the premiere, Kensi and Deeks finally reconcile from their previous fight from the season nine finale, getting back together and resuming their engagement. Kensi and Deeks continue to plan their wedding throughout the season and later open up their bar. Towards the end of the season, Kensi and Deeks's wedding day has arrived. However, Kensi remains unaware of the events regarding Anatoli Kirkin and while the rest of the team deals with the situation, Kensi is busy getting ready along with her friends and mother until Anatoli reveals himself to her. Kensi later finds herself having to fight against Anatoli's former bodyguards. Finally, Kensi and Deeks get married and become husband and wife with Hetty officiating the ceremony. = Season 11 = Early in the beginning of the season, Kensi briefly believes she maybe pregnant, until she later learns it was a false alarm, but the experience causes Kensi and Deeks to finally have a real discussion about having children. Throughout the season, Kensi and Deeks happily adjust to married life and continue to hold a strong and healthy relationship as well as managing the bar, finally naming it, \\"The Squid and Dagger\\". Later, after Deeks walks into a trap and almost dies in bomb explosion, the event causes Kensi to finally admit and realize she truly wants to have children with him. Since then, they have been trying to get pregnant.

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Guepinia helvelloides, commonly known as the apricot jelly. The fungus produces salmon-pink, ear-shaped, gelatinous fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in small tufted groups on soil, usually associated with buried rotting wood. The fruit bodies are tall and up to wide; the stalks are not well-differentiated from the cap. The fungus, although rubbery, is edible, and may be eaten raw with salads, pickled, or candied. It has a white spore deposit, and the oblong to ellipsoid spores measure 9–11 by 5–6 micrometers. The fungus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, and has also been collected from South America. Taxonomy The species was first described and illustrated as Tremella rufa by Nicolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1778. Elias Magnus Fries later (1828) called it Guepinia helvelloides in his Elenchus Fungorum, based on Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Tremella helvelloides, both being names he sanctioned. This has made Tremella rufa and all names based on it unavailable for use, as they are conserved. Later, Lucien Quélet erected a separate monotypic genus Phlogiotis for Jacquin's species, whereas Julius Oscar Brefeld placed it (as Gyrocephalus rufa) in Persoon's small genus Gyrocephalus (rejected name for Gyromitra). The proper name for the fungus was debated for some time, as the name Guepinia is a homonym (pointed out by Fries in 1828), because it had been used by Toussaint Bastard in 1812 for a genus of flowering plants in the Cruciferae family. To further complicate matters, the generic name Teesdalia, originally considered to have priority over the name Guepinia for the plant genus, was later determined to have been validly published after Guepinia, rendering Teesdalia an illegitimate name. In 1982, changes in the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature gave protected status to all names adopted by Fries in the Elenchus Fungorum, and established Guepinia as the correct genus name. Guepinia is variously classified in the Auriculariales order, with uncertain familial position (incertae sedis), or as part of the Exidiaceae family. The genus is named after French mycologist Jean-Pierre Guépin (1779–1858). The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"red jelly fungus\\", or \\"apricot jelly\\". Description In Germany The fruit bodies of Guepinia helvelloides grow singly or in small clumps. Although they can appear to be growing in the soil, their mycelium lives in buried wood. They are tall and wide, spoon- or tongue- shaped, and twisted like a cornet or horn so that they look like a slender funnel, cut out on one side and often with a wavy margin. The fruit bodies are flexible, thick, and smooth on the outer side which they are usually attenuated on the underside into a cylindrical or depressed stem that is up to high and about thick. The stem is normally covered with a white tomentum at the base. The upper side (inside) of the fruit body is usually quite sterile or with a few isolated basidia and is slightly verrucose as a result of the densely crowded protruding ends of the hyphae. The sterile and fertile surfaces of the fruit body are almost the same color, transparent reddish- orange to flesh pink or flesh orange, at other times more purplish-red. The fruit bodies usually develop a slightly brownish tinge when they are old. The underside is usually slightly more vividly colored than the upper side. The flesh is gelatinous, softly so in the upper part of the fruit body and with a more cartilage-like consistency in the stem. It has a nondescript odor, and a watery, insignificant taste. The hymenium is developed on the under (outer) side of the fruit body. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) consist of a globular part (the hypobasidia) to which inflated or elongated epibasidia are attached. In Guepinia, the hypobasidia are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, measuring 12–16 by 9–12 μm, and attached to fibril-like epibasidia that are 20–45 by 3–4 μm. The spore deposit is white, while the spores are 9–11 by 5–6 μm, hyaline (translucent), cylindrical to elongated ellipsoid in shape, and have a large oil drop. =Edibility= Guepinia helvelloides is an edible, but bland, fungus. Older specimens are usually tough and indigestible. It can be used raw in salads, for pickling in vinegar and also for preserving in sugar like candied fruit. One source reports using it to prepare a wine by fermenting with wine yeast. =Similar species= The red chanterelle (Cantharellus cinnabarinus) has gills on the undersurface. Guepinia helvelloides has a rather unusual appearance, and is not likely to be mistaken for other fungi. However, the red chanterelle species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G. helvelloides, however, it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth. Habitat and distribution Guepinia helvelloides is saprobic, deriving nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The fruit bodies of G. helveloides typically grow solitarily or in small tufts on soil, usually in association with buried rotting wood. Although the fruit bodies sometimes appear in the spring, they are more commonly found in the summer and autumn months. In North America, it is associated with coniferous forests. It is also found throughout temperate North America, from Canada to Mexico. Europe, Iran, and Turkey. It is also known from Brazil and Puerto Rico. The fungus has also been collected from the Qinling region of China.

His courtesy name is Zhongyin (). In the eighth year of the Emperor Jiaqing (1803), he passed the imperial examination for military service, and he was successively assigned to the Bazong (), Qianzong (), Shoubei (), Youji (), Canjiang () and vice general (), and these were the military ranking system during the Qing dynasty. In the sixth year of the Emperor Daoguang (1826), he was assigned to the vice-general of the Taihu camp in Jiangsu province. In 1827, Guan was assigned to the army officer in Susong county in Jiangnan. In the thirteenth year of the Emperor Daoguang (1833), Guan was assigned to the military commander of the Jiangnan area.  Anti- Opium Movement  In the fourteenth year of the Emperor Daoguang (1834), Guan was assigned to the navy commander of the Guangdong province. When he arrived at Guangdong, he devoted himself to strengthen the coastal defense affairs. In the nineteenth year of the Emperor Daoguang (1839), Lin Zexu was assigned to imperial commissioner to prohibit the use of opium in Guangzhou. When Lin arrived, Guan was influenced by Lin. Guan mobilized his navy to coordinate with Lin to prohibit the Opium trade. They captured about 20,000 chests of opium from the British merchants.  Battle Between the Qing and the British Forces  In 1839, British warships attacked Qing navy in Chuenpi, Guan Tianpei commanded his navy and fought back, British warships were heavily inflicted by Guan's navy. In the twentieth year of the Emperor Daoguang (1840), Lin Zexu was dismissed by the Emperor Daoguang. Qishan replaced Lin's position. Qi gave orders to remove Guan's coastal defence affairs by reducing the number of navy soldiers, and this gave the British forces the chance to invade. Many Guangdong local government officials hoped to make peace with the British forces. But Guan Tianpei was not swayed, and he was preparing to fight the British forces. Before the battle started, he dispatched a soldier to take his old clothes and tooth back to his hometown to give to his relatives. On January 1841, British forces captured Shajiao () and Dajiao fort (). Thus, Weiyuan Fort lost the protective screen. Guan Tianpei was defending with a few soldiers on the front line. Guan requested Qishan to reinforce, but Qi did not send an army to support Guan. Guan used his money for army food supplement, and he encouraged his soldier to fight the British forces. On February 26, British forces massively attacked Humen. Guan led 400 soldiers to fight back. Several forts were captured by the British force. A soldier asked Guan to retreat, but Guan refused and kept fighting. Guan gave his commander seal to a soldier and asked him to take it back to the emperor. A shell fired and hit Guan. Guan died along with 400 soldiers.

Life He styled himself \\"Senonensis\\", implying he was born at or near Sens. He studied at Orléans in 1534, and about 1536 settled in England: his letters of denization, dated 2 July 1544, state that he had been eight years in that country, that he had been a student at Cambridge (apparently without graduating), and that he was, and intended continuing to be, a tutor. In 1550 he had moved to Worcester. On 21 August 1551 he was ordained deacon by Nicholas Ridley at Fulham, and on the 29 August he received priest's orders. He was instituted on 3 January 1552 to the rectory of St Alphage, Cripplegate. He witnessed, or was in some way implicated in, the uproar at Paul's Cross, which led on 16 August 1553 to the arrest of John Bradford; Véron was also committed to the Tower of London, both being styled seditious preachers. Ridley, writing to Bradford in 1554, inquired for Véron, who in 1554 was deprived of his benefice and remained a prisoner till Queen Elizabeth's accession. On his release he became a preacher at Paul's Cross, was appointed prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral on 8 November 1559, rector of St Martin, Ludgate, on 8 March 1560, and vicar of St Sepulchre on 21 October 1560, preferments he held till his death. On 8 October 1559 he preached before the queen at Whitehall, when he urged that Protestant bishops should retain the old temporalities of their sees, so as to live in proper style. Aspersions were cast on his character, and on 2 November 1561 a man did penance at Paul's Cross for calumniating Véron, while on the 23 November Henry Machyn had also publicly to apologise. John Strype describes him as a courageous and eloquent preacher. On 1 March 1562 Véron certified to the Privy Council the accuracy of a translation of a French pamphlet against Catholicism, which there was an idea of publishing in England. He died on 9 April 1563, and was buried in St. Paul's, but seems to have had no tombstone. Works Most of his works were in dialogue form. In 1548 he published a volume entitled \\"Certyne Litel Treaties set forth by J. V. for the erudition and learnyng of the symple and ignorant peopell\\", London. It included \\"The Five abominable Blasphemies contained in the Mass\\", an English translation of Heinrich Bullinger's treatise against the Anabaptists, \\"The Byble the Word of God\\", \\"No Humane Lymmes the Father hath\\", and \\"The Masse is an Idol\\". In 1550 he dedicated to Sir John Yorke \\"The godly Sayings of the ancient Fathers on the Sacrament\\" (Worcester; reprinted 1846). There he also translated Huldrych Zwingli's \\"Short Pathway to the Understanding of the Scriptures\\", dedicated to Sir Arthur Darcy, and Bullinger on \\"Infant Baptism\\". \\"The Ymage of both Pastours\\" appeared at London in 1550. He published while in the Tower a translation of Bullinger's \\"Dialogue between a Libertine and a Christian\\". About 1560 Véron published \\"A moste necessary treatise of free wil not onlye against the Papists, but also against the Anabaptists\\" (London); and in 1561 \\"The Huntynge of Purgatorye to Death\\" (London), an adaptation of works of Pierre Viret\\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\", Véron, Jean (d. 1563), religious writer and translator and Church of England clergyman by Carrie Euler. dedicated to Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, and \\"The Overthrow of the Justification of Works\\", dedicated to James Blount, 6th Baron Mountjoy. He was also the author of \\"A frutefull Treatise of Predestination... with an Apology of the same... whereunto are added... a very necessary boke against the free wyll men, and another of the true justification of faith and the good workes proceadynge of the same\\" (London, 1563?), dedicated to the queen; \\"A strong defence of the Marryage of Pryestes\\", and \\"A strong Battery against the Idolatrous Invocation of the dead Saintes\\" (London, 1562). John Awdelay (fl. 1559–1577) wrote some verses to his memory, and in 1575 Rodolphus Waddington published a \\"Latin-English Dictionary\\" which Véron had left in manuscript.

Hardee Memorial Hospital The hospital was started in the 1970s as Hardee Memorial Hospital. The main hospital building has always been located a 533 W. Carlton Street. This hospital has always been small, but from the start it provided necessary health services for a highly rural area of Florida. From the start it had a maternity unit, although apparently no emergency or outpatient services. Baby swap incident In 1978 a baby swap took place at Hardee Memorial that ultimately forced it to close its doors. Babies Arlena Twigg and Kimberly Mays were born within days of each other and were switched and sent home with the wrong parents. Relatives of one of the mothers were prominent in the opening of Hardee Memorial. One was involved in the building and financing of the hospital and another was on the hospital board of trustees. The baby swap was discovered ten years later, when one baby died of a congenital heart defect and laboratory testing showed the baby was not related to her parents. In 1992 author Loretta Schwartz-Nobel published a book about the incident. The book, The Baby Swap Conspiracy, also inspired a TV movie, Switched at Birth, that had aired the previous year.Schwartz-Nobel's website, http://www.lorettaschwartznobel.com/published/index/php . According to Schwartz-Nobel, Hardee Memorial was forced into bankruptcy due to the legal battle concerning the baby swap. Hardee Memorial closed in July 1992. Soon after Florida Hospital Heartland Division, which ran hospitals in Sebring, Florida, and Lake Placid, Florida, obtained the closed hospital and has been running it ever since.Florida Hospital Heartland Division (FHHD) website, http://www.fhhd.org/AboutUs/FacilitiesLocations.aspx . Florida Hospital takes over Hardee Memorial Hospital Florida Hospital expanded services at Wauchula soon after reopening the hospital. The emergency and outpatient departments opened in 1993. The emergency department expanded from seven to fourteen beds in 2009 and upgraded its equipment. Seriously ill patients coming into the emergency department are transferred to the Florida Hospitals at Sebring or Lake Placid or to larger hospitals in Tampa and Orlando. Outpatient services have grown to include laboratory testing, electrocardiograms (ECGs), x-rays and MRIs. Expansion of services since 1993 The hospital has twenty-five inpatient beds. A transitional care unit was opened in the hospital to provide rehabilitative care for patients discharged from the Division's three hospitals, but deemed to need further care before returning home. In 2004 a hospitalist position was added to aid in the care of inpatients.FHHD website. Florida Hospital Wauchula has several activities in buildings outside of the hospital building. Across the street, at 522-526 W. Carlton, is a building that originally housed the Wauchula Daybreak Behavioral Health unit, the Women's Wellness Center and the practice of Kathleen Welch-Wilson, MD, and Joseph Toulouse, MD. Toulouse became the emergency services director at Florida Hospital Lake Placid in 2009. At 457 W. Carlton was the Wauchula Outpatient Center, opened in March 2009. The Outpatient Center housed the Wauchula Center for Wound Healing and the Wauchula Sleep Disorders Center. In July 2011 the Outpatient Center closed and the two units there moved to 522-526 W. Carlton. In early 2014 the Wound Center at Wauchula, according to the FHHD website, relocated to inside the main hospital building, at 533 W. Carlton. In March 2014 Dr. Welch-Wilson's practice was closed, leaving only the Women's Center and the Sleep Center at 522-526 W. Carlton. In 2016 the Women's Center closed for a time and the Sleep Center permanently closed. The Wauchula Therapy Center, at 1330 Highway 17 South, provides physical therapy services.FHHD Website. On December 2, 2010, Tim Cook, CEO for FHHD, announced Florida Hospital took ownership of Pioneer Medical Clinic, in the building between the main hospital building and the Outpatient Center.

Life = Early career = He was born about 1490,the third son of John Yorke, by his wife Katherine Patterdale or Patterdall. His grandfather, Sir Richard Yorke, was a merchant in York, and in 1466 was Mayor of the Staple at Calais. Sir Richard's son Thomas, John's uncle, was also a merchant, and John appears to have joined the family business and spent time as a merchant in Calais and Antwerp. On 3 September 1535 he arrived at Calais from Antwerp with intelligence of a sermon preached against King Henry VIII, by a friar in Antwerp. The Lord Deputy of Calais, Lord Lisle, passed on the report to Thomas Cromwell, and York received a reward. In 1544 he was appointed assay master to the Mint. In 1547 he was promoted to be Master of the Mint at Southwark, established in the former mansion of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. In 1549 he was sheriff of London. In October of this year the quarrel had broken out between the Protector Somerset and John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. Somerset as a defensive move had retired with King Edward VI to Hampton Court, and asked the City of London to furnish him with a thousand men for the royal protection. Warwick, in order to counteract him, moved into the city and stayed at York's house in Walbrook from 6 October 1549. The city came onto Warwick's side. On 8 October the confederate lords dined together at York's house, and on the following day the common council responded to their summons of aid by promising a contingent of soldiers to support them. As a reward for his services Edward VI visited York at his official residence in Southwark on 17 October, and, after dining there, knighted him. Somerset, having been confined in the Tower of London, was brought to York's house at Walbrook on 6 February following, and there released on his recognisances. Here the privy council again sat two days after, probably for security. York appears to have enjoyed at this time the office of master of the king's woods. Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, was deprived of office on 1 October 1549, and the temporalities of the see passed to the crown. York thereupon began felling the bishop's woods. The privy council on 24 February 1550 issued an injunction against him, further prohibiting him from removing the woods already felled, which suggests suspicions of peculation. He apparently disobeyed, for a fresh prohibition was issued on 17 March. On the following 14 June the council again wrote to him, this time forbidding him to continue felling the king's woods near Deptford, the timber to be preserved for naval purposes. Meanwhile, York was active in his duties at the mint, at a time when changes in the coinage followed each other in rapid succession. = Currency speculation = During some time in the summer of 1550 York was employed in secret missions abroad. The king's debts were mounting, and the Privy Council turned to York to solve the problem. He devised a plan to make a large profit on the Antwerp exchange as well as to bring home quality bullion from abroad for the production of new English coin. In December 1550 York went to Antwerp to speculate with the king's money. Things did not go to plan, and by March 1551 he had suffered losses of at least £4000 of silver bullion, when he and his men were caught red-handed trying to smuggle £4000 in bullion out of Antwerp. However the scheme did not fail entirely, and as a mint official York brought in large amounts of bullion on which he made a handsome personal profit. In 1551 he was given the task, with Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, of restoring the coinage. Many of the coins issued were stamped with Y, one of York's mint marks. In 1552 York was pardoned 'for all treasons and offences concerning making and issuing of the king's money', on the condition that he settle his mint accounts for over £9500 'due to the king'. = Later career = York enriched himself by foreign trading. In May 1553 he formed one of the Russia Company incorporated under a charter of Edward VI. He retained the friendship of the Duke of Northumberland (as John Dudley now was), and he was prominent as a supporter of the claims of Lady Jane Grey. On 23 July 1553, after the collapse of the Grey conspiracy and two days later than the duke, York was put under arrest in his own house by the lord mayor. On 30 July the privy council issued a warrant for his committal to the Tower of London. An inventory of his goods was ordered, and they were seized to Queen Mary's use. Sixty cloths which were being exported by him were stopped at Dover. On 31 July he was sent to the Tower, being confined in the Bell Tower. On 18 October he was released. After his release, on 5 November 1553, York attended at St Stephen's, Walbrook, the sermon of John Feckenham, Queen Mary's private chaplain and confessor. He was at this time an alderman of the city; but his place at the Mint had been filled, and he does not reappear in public life till after the accession of Elizabeth. In 1559 he was elected MP for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire. On 5 October 1560, when a project of recoinage was under consideration, York wrote to William Cecil a letter of advice, winding up with a request for Cecil's interest in his favour. Among his recommendations was one for the employment of foreign refiners, as being of superior skill. It would appear from a letter from a Flemish company to Sir Thomas Gresham, written from Antwerp in this year, that York actually went to Flanders on this business but he was not reinstated in office at the Mint. He died some time before the end of 1569.  Landed estates  York's merchant activities and his career as a mint official enabled him to enrich himself. He acquired land at Woolwich in Kent and at Barking and East Ham in Essex. In 1547 he bought the former Byland Abbey estates (Stonebeck Up and Stonebeck Down) in Nidderdale in Yorkshire, including Gouthwaite, a house which his father had apparently occupied. In 1549 he bought the manor of Appletreewick in Wharfedale, a former possession of Bolton Priory, which included the valuable lead mining area of Greenhow Hill. In 1551 he bought the former lands of Whitby Abbey from his friend John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. Also in about 1551 he bought from the Duke of Suffolk the manor of Austwick and neighbouring manors. While York was imprisoned in 1553, the inhabitants of Whitby, tenants of the lands of Whitby Abbey, took advantage of his imprisonment to bring an action against him in the Court of Requests for excessive raising of their rents. On 24 October the court gave judgment against him. About the same time another action was brought against him in the same court by Avere or Alvered Uvedale, mineral lessee of the Byland Abbey lands, complaining that York had refused to allow the plaintiff to cut down timber for his mines, and had seized a large quantity of lead ore belonging to him. The issue of this case has not been preserved. Family York married Anne or Anna, daughter of Robert Smyth of London. According to the ‘Visitation of Yorkshire’ of 1563–4, and Glover's ‘Visitation of Yorkshire’ in 1584–5, Lady York afterwards married Robert Paget of London; but according to the ‘Visitation of London’ in 1560 she was the widow of one Pagett when she married York. Six of York's sons were still alive when he wrote his will in 1562: Peter, William, Edmund, Rowland, Edward, and Henry. He also left two daughters. He left most of his estates, including his Nidderdale and Wharfedale properties, to his son Peter. The spelling of the name, both in the signature of his letter to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley and in the plea put in by him in his defence against the tenants of Whitby in the court of requests, is York.

This generation of Microsoft Tablet PCs were designed to run Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, the Tablet PC version of Windows XP. This version of Microsoft Windows superseded Microsoft's earlier pen computing operating environment, Windows for Pen Computing 2.0. After releasing Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Microsoft designed the successive desktop computer versions of Windows, Windows Vista and Windows 7, to support pen computing intrinsically. The Tablet PC with Windows XP released in 2001 possessed 128 megabytes of RAM and a 600 megahertz processor, with a storage capacity of 10GB. Following Windows for Pen Computing, Microsoft has been developing for tablets running Windows under the Microsoft Tablet PC name.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/ms840465.aspx According to a 2001 Microsoft definition of the term, \\"Microsoft Tablet PCs\\" are pen-based, fully functional x86 PCs with handwriting and voice recognition functionality. Tablet PCs use the same hardware as normal laptops but add support for pen input. For specialized support for pen input, Microsoft released Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Today there is no tablet specific version of Windows but instead support is built into both Home and Business versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7. Tablets running Windows get the added functionality of using the touchscreen for mouse input, hand writing recognition, and gesture support. Following Tablet PC, Microsoft announced the UMPC initiative in 2006 which brought Windows tablets to a smaller, touch-centric configuration. This was relaunched in 2010 as Slate PC, to promote tablets running Windows 7 Slate PCs are expected to benefit from mobile hardware advances derived from the success of the netbooks. Many tablet manufacturers are moving to the ARM architecture with lighter operating systems, Microsoft followed suit in 2012 with Surface and Windows RT. Though Microsoft has Windows RT for ARM support it has kept its target market for the smartphone industry with Windows Phone 8. Some manufacturers, however, still have shown prototypes of Windows CE-based tablets running a custom shell. Configurations =Booklet= Booklet PCs are dual screen tablet computers that fold like a book. Typical booklet PCs are equipped with multi-touch screens and pen writing recognition abilities. They are designed to be used as digital day planners, internet surfing devices, project planners, music players, and displays for video, live TV, and e-reading. =Slate= Slate computers, which resemble writing slates, are tablet computers without a dedicated keyboard. For text input, users rely on handwriting recognition via an active digitizer, touching an on-screen keyboard using fingertips or a stylus, or using an external keyboard that can usually be attached via a wireless or USB connection. Tablet PCs typically incorporate small () LCD screens and have been popular in vertical markets such as health care, education, hospitality and field work. Applications for field work often need a tablet PC that has rugged specifications that ensure long life by resisting heat, humidity, and drop/vibration damage. This added focus on mobility and/or ruggedness often leads to eliminating moving parts that could raise vulnerability. =Convertible= A Lenovo ThinkPad X61 Tablet in slate mode Convertible notebooks have a base body with an attached keyboard. They more closely resemble modern laptops, and are usually heavier and larger than slates. Typically, the base of a convertible attaches to the display at one joint called a swivel hinge or rotating hinge. The joint allows the screen to rotate through 180° and fold down on top of the keyboard to provide a flat writing surface. This design, although the most common, creates a physical point of weakness on the notebook. Some manufacturers have attempted to overcome these weak points. The Panasonic Toughbook CF-19, for example, is advertised as a more durable convertible notebook. One model by Acer (the TravelMate C210) has a sliding design in which the screen slides up from the slate-like position and locks into place to provide the laptop mode. Convertibles are by far the most popular configuration of tablet PCs, because they still offer the keyboard and pointing device (usually a trackpad) of older notebooks, for users who do not use the touchscreen display as the primary input method. =Hybrid= Hybrids, coined by users of the HP/Compaq TC1000 and TC1100 series, share the features of the slate and convertible by using a detachable keyboard that operates similarly to a convertible when attached. Hybrids are not the same as slate models with detachable keyboards. Detachable keyboards for pure slate models do not rotate to allow the tablet to rest on it like a convertible. An examples of hybrids are Microsoft Surface (10.6 or 12) or Fujitsu Stylistic (11.6 with an Intel-i5-vPro processor).www.fujitsu.com/uk/products/computing/pc/tablets/stylistic-q702/ (August 2014) System software Windows 7 touch capability is similar to Microsoft PixelSense technologies (formerly known as Microsoft Surface). This is a gesture and touch-centric UI enhancement that works with most current touch computers. Windows has a history of tablet technology including Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Tablet PC Edition is a superset of Windows XP Professional, the difference being tablet functionality, including alternate text input (Tablet PC Input Panel) and basic drivers for support of tablet PC specific hardware. Requirements to install Tablet PC Edition include a tablet digitizer or touchscreen device, and hardware control buttons including a Ctrl-Alt-Delete shortcut button, scrolling buttons, and at least one user- configurable application button. Service Pack 2 for Windows XP includes Tablet PC Edition 2005 and is a free upgrade. This version brought improved handwriting recognition and improved the Input Panel, allowing it to be used in almost every application. The Input Panel was also revised to extend speech recognition services (input and correction) to other applications. With the succession of Windows Vista, the Tablet PC functionality no longer needed a separate edition. Tablet PC support is built into all editions of Windows Vista with the exception of Home Basic and Starter editions. This extends the handwriting recognition, ink collection,MSDN Ink collection and additional input methods to any computer running Vista even if the input device is an external digitizer, a touch screen, or even a regular mouse. Vista also supports multi-touch functions and gestures (originally developed for the Microsoft PixelSense version of Vista) and is now usable by the public with the release of multi-touch tablets. Windows Vista also significantly improved handwriting recognition functionality with the introduction of a handwriting recognition personalization tool as well as an automatic handwriting learning tool. Tablet functionality is available in all editions of Windows 7 except the Starter edition. It introduces a new Math Input Panel that recognizes handwritten math expressions and formulas, and integrates with other programs. Windows 7 also significantly improved pen input and handwriting recognition by becoming faster, more accurate, and supportive of more languages, including East Asian writing systems. Personalized custom dictionaries help with the recognition of specialized vocabulary (like medical and technical terms), and text prediction speeds up the input process to make note-taking faster. Multi- touch technology is also available on some Tablet PCs, enabling more advanced interaction using touch gestures with your fingers the same way a mouse is used. Despite such advances, problems may arise with tablet functions of the OS, when, for instance, touch screen drivers are recognized as PS/2 mouse input rather than a touch input device. In such instances tablet functions may be unavailable or severely restricted in functionality. Windows applications Applications developed for the tablet PC cater to the configuration and functionality available on the platform. Many forms of applications incorporate a pen-friendly user interface and/or the ability to hand write directly in the document or interface.

What appeals to one user may be exactly what disappoints another. The following are commonly cited opinions of the tablet PC platform: = Advantages = * Use in environments not conducive to a keyboard and mouse such as lying in bed, standing, or handling with one hand. * Lighter weight, lower power models can function similarly to dedicated reading devices like the Amazon Kindle. * Touch environment makes navigation easier than conventional use of keyboard and mouse or touch pad in certain contexts such as image manipulation, or mouse oriented games. * Digital painting and image editing is enhanced and more realistic than painting or sketching with a mouse. * The ability for easier or faster entering of diagrams, mathematical notations, and symbols. * Allows, with the proper software, universal input, independent from different keyboard localizations. * Some users find it more natural and fun to use a stylus to click on objects rather than a mouse or touchpad, which are not directly connected to the pointer on screen. * Use in entertainment for all media. = Disadvantages = * Higher cost — convertible tablet PCs can cost significantly more than their non-tablet counterparts although this premium has been predicted to fall.Convertibles: The new laptop bling? - CNET News.com * Input speed — handwriting can be significantly slower than typing speeds, the latter of which can be as high as 50-150 words per minute; however, Slideit, Swype and other technologies are able to provide alternate, speedier methods of input. * Screen and hinge damage risk - Tablet PCs are handled more than conventional laptops, yet are built on similar frames; in addition, since their screens also serve as input devices, they run a higher risk of screen damage via impacts and misuse. A convertible tablet PC's screen hinge often must rotate around two axes, unlike a normal laptop screen, subsequently increasing the number of possible mechanical and electrical (digitizer and video cables, embedded Wi-Fi antennas, etc.) failure points. * Ergonomics - a tablet PC does not provide room for a wrist rest while the screen is folded into slate mode. In addition, the user will need to move their arm constantly while writing. * Weaker video abilities - Most tablet PCs are equipped with embedded graphics processors instead of discrete graphics cards. In July 2010, the only tablet PC's with discrete graphics cards were the HP TouchSmart tm2t,and the Gateway M285-E which has the ATI Mobility Radeon HD5450 and X1400 series Features In addition to the host of features found on regular laptops, tablet PCs may also possess: *Capacitive contact technology, which can sense finger(s) on the screen without needing significant pressure for system to recognize an input.Tablet PC offers capacitive touch sensing capability., Dell, Inc *Palm recognition, which prevent inadvertent palms or other contacts from disrupting the pen's input. *Multi-touch abilities, which can recognize multiple simultaneous finger touches, allowing for enhanced manipulation of on-screen objects.jkOnTheRun:So what is multi-touch?

He is best known as \\"The Cello Guy\\" of the classical new-age musical group The Piano Guys, with whom he has released eight number-one albums and dozens of music videos. He also has three solo albums to his credit. He is considered a pioneer in \\"cello-percussion\\", which enhances traditional cello playing with pizzicato and percussive techniques. Early life and education Steven Sharp Nelson grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of John C. Nelson. His mother was a former professional opera singer and his younger sister, Camille Nelson, is a folk musician. When he was seven, Nelson's father decided that each of his children would learn to play an instrument invented before 1800. Nelson tried the violin but discovered a passion for the cello. He studied cello with teacher Kate Reaves and then with Ryan Selberg, the principal cellist for the Utah Symphony. Since his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inhibited his attention span for long practice sessions, he began practicing on other instruments as well, including drums, guitar, and piano. This led to his developing creative ways to play the cello: \\"strumming it, banging it and using pizzicato much more aggressively – using my thumb, fist, fingernail and palm\\". He also began playing with different types of musical groups, including bands, orchestras, and string quartets. Nelson earned his bachelor's degree in music from the University of Utah in 2002. In 2007 he earned a master's degree in public administration, as well as a graduate certificate in urban planning, from the same institution. Career Nelson initially pursued a career as a real estate developer, becoming the owner of Thornton Walker Real Estate. In his spare time, he played cello to accompany local musicians both on stage and in the studio. By 2006, he had played on more than 100 locally produced music CDs. Among his musician partners were several pianists and a guitarist. In 2006 he described his music as \\"an escape, rather than a vocation\\", and didn't expect music to become his primary career. In 1999 Nelson signed with Stone Angel Music, an independent record label in Salt Lake City founded by Paul Cardall. His first solo album, Sacred Cello (2006), entered the Billboard charts top 20 classical recordings and garnered a Pearl Award for Best Instrumental Classical Album. His other two solo albums are Tender Mercies (2008) and Christmas Cello (2010). =The Piano Guys= The Piano Guys' Jon Schmidt (left) and Nelson (right) perform live in 2002 Nelson became a member of The Piano Guys in 2011. The group was the brainchild of Paul Anderson, owner of The Piano Guys piano store in St. George, Utah, who sought an innovative way to promote his store via social media. In 2009 Anderson saw a YouTube music video that local musician Jon Schmidt had uploaded \\"for fun\\", featuring Schmidt on piano and Nelson on cello and kick drum performing a mashup called \\"Love Story Meets Viva la Vida\\", which combined the Taylor Swift country pop \\"Love Story\\" with Coldplay's Baroque pop \\"Viva la Vida\\". The video garnered over one million hits. Anderson hired the duo to perform on videos that he would professionally film in unusual locations and upload to his store's YouTube channel. Nelson brought in his neighbor, Al van der Beek, a songwriter and music arranger who had a home recording studio, to the project. Tel Stewart assisted with video production. The Piano Guys gained their first widespread exposure with \\"Michael Meets Mozart\\" (2011), thanks to Schmidt's invitation to the nearly 30,000 people on his fan mailing list \\"to watch it and share it\\"; as a result, people began watching the videos beyond the region. The video featured Nelson playing 100 cello tracks to achieve the final effect. Nelson's video performances of \\"Cello Wars\\" (2011) and \\"Beethoven's 5 Secrets\\" (2012) debuted at number one on the YouTube charts. The Piano Guys signed with Sony Masterworks in 2012. At that point they all quit their regular jobs to pursue their musical career. The group has released eight number-one albums. As of August 2018 they have surpassed 1.6 billion views on their YouTube channel and have 6.2 million subscribers. Musical style Nelson performs a variety of musical styles, including classical, folk, new age, and inspirational. He is considered a pioneer in \\"cello- percussion\\", which enhances traditional cello playing with pizzicato and percussive techniques. He owns 29 cellos, which he says produce different sounds and have different \\"personalities\\". He also plays kick drum. He credits his influences as Yo-Yo Ma, Bobby McFerrin, and Victor Borge. Personal life Nelson is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As part of his faith, Nelson served a mission to South Korea. He considers his art and his touring as a means to spread the gospel; he says that he also gives away a copy of the Book of Mormon to someone on nearly every tour. He and the other members of The Piano Guys, all members of the Church of Jesus Christ, pray together before each concert, recording session, and video shoot. Nelson and his wife, Julie, have four children and reside in Salt Lake City. In 2017, he performed a duet together with his daughter Lucy, who sang, in the One Voice Children's Choir's music video of \\"Only Hope\\". In 2018 he performed with his wife, who played violin, in a cover of \\"Rewrite the Stars\\".

It purchases individual casks from more than 140\\"The SMWS Distilleries\\" malt whisky distilleries in Scotland and throughout the world, bottles them and retails directly to its members. It also runs three private members' rooms in the UK and in several international locations. History The origins of the Society lie in Phillip \\"Pip\\" Hills' travels around the Scottish Highlands in the late 1970s, during which he sampled several whiskies drawn straight from the cask.MacLean, Charles. \\"The Scottish Malt Whisky Society\\", Scots, 22 July 2008. Hills was so affected by what he tasted that, in 1978, he persuaded several acquaintances to share in the cost of a cask from the Glenfarclas distillery. Over time, the group of friends expanded to become a small syndicate and more casks were purchased, bottled and distributed to subscribing members. Coinciding with the decision to open membership to the wider public in 1983, the Society purchased its first property, The Vaults, in Leith; a building, whose vaulted wine cellars reputedly stretch back to the 12th century. The Society created a set of members' rooms there. In 1996, the Society launched a share scheme for its members, the proceeds from which were invested in the purchase of a London venue. 2004 saw the Society open a second venue in Edinburgh – a Georgian townhouse on Queen Street. In the same year, the Society was acquired by Glenmorangie PLC.The Glenmorangie Company To mark the 25th anniversary of its foundation, the Society redesigned its bottles, to include more information and a full tasting note on the front of the bottle.\\"A new era for the society\\", Unfiltered Magazine, November 2008. In 2015 the Society was sold back to private investors from Glenmorangie PLC. Membership To buy whisky bottled by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society, it is necessary to be a member. Membership in the UK costs £65 for the first year and can be purchased with a choice of add ons. Members are required to pay a smaller annual renewal fee every year to retain membership – the cost of which varies depending on type of membership and location. New members receive a membership pack containing 3 sample bottles of Society whisky and various other items including a Members' Handbook and Notebook, a lapel badge and membership card. Membership entitles members to buy Society whisky and also gives members access to its private members' venues (along with the ability to bring 3 non-member guests), and the opportunity to buy tickets for various tasting events. The events are held at is members' venues and also at other non-Society venues around the country. Members also receive a quarterly publication called Unfiltered – an award- winning \\"IOIC – Best membership publication 2010\\" , June 2010. magazine that keeps them up to date on Society news, plus articles from the wider whisky world. Locations The Society has four Members' Rooms in the UK, where whiskies are sold by the bottle or for consumption on the premises by the dram. These are located at The Vaults, Leith; 28 Queen Street, Edinburgh; 38 Bath Street, Glasgow and 19 Greville Street, London. The Society also operates non-member bars under the Kaleidoscope brand. There is a Kaleidoscope bar situated on 28 Queen Street in Edinburgh which sits alongside the company's members–only bar. The second Kaleidoscope venue was based in Devonshire Square in central London but has since closed.\\"Kaleidoscope Bar\\" It also has branches in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and the U.S.A.\\"The Scotch Malt Whisky Society website: International Branches\\" In 2010, the Society partnered with The Hotel du Vin & Malmaison group to introduce a new 'whisky snug' bar concept to the Aberdeen Malmaison, Brighton Hotel du Vin and Birmingham Hotel du Vin.\\"A dram fine combination for hotel chains\\", Scotsman Whisky: A definitive guide, 13 January 2010. Bottlings Casks are only acquired by the Society after approval by an appointed 'Tasting Panel', comprising Society representatives, those directly involved in the distilling industry and various other suitably qualified parties. The Tasting Panel also gives each bottling a whimsical set of tasting notes which provide an indication of what flavours and textures the drinker can expect. Each bottle is also given a quirky and descriptive name – such as 'Kissed up by sweet promises' or 'Intense menu of seduction'. The resulting 'outturn' of each cask is given a unique, two-part numerical identifier, representing first the originating distillery and second the individual cask from which the bottle was taken. For example, 2.35 represents the 35th cask acquired from distillery number two. Society bottlings are always referred to using this numerical code, rather than by the distillery name, as individual casks are unique and, therefore, may not be representative of the whisky produced by that distillery for ordinary retail. The number of bottles available from each outturn of a cask can vary – but single casks by their very nature only produce a limited amount of whisky so, more often than not, there is only a small number of bottles available, making each release rare and sought-after. The Society releases new whisky selections for its members once or twice a month. The Society has also bottled single casks from grain whisky distilleries, identified by the prefix 'G' in the cask number. Other non- whisky spirits have been released, such as gin, rum, and cognac, as well as blended whisky and cognacs. Each variety has their own bottle number prefix. Occasionally, the Society releases bottlings with special labels – such as the Far Flung Flavours, a set of three bottles with labels and names that break with the traditional style of Society labels. Each bottle has a specially designed label based on the key characteristics of the whisky – for example, 'Wasabi Wipe-out', which featured an illustration of a Sumo wrestler surfing on the label. As of September 2010, around 3,597 single casks had been bottled by the Society since 1983. Society whisky is bottled at its original cask strength, typically upwards of 55 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV). It is more common in the Scotch whisky industry to reduce the spirit at bottling to around 40 per cent and put it through a chill filtering process, which prevents it from clouding at low temperatures.\\"The Scotch Malt Whisky Society website\\" Notes Scottish malt whisky Organizations established in 1983 1983 establishments in Scotland Organisations based in Edinburgh Leith Clubs and societies in Scotland Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues ","title":"Scotch Malt Whisky Society"},{"id":"28977485","text":"Francis Woodman Cleaves (born in Boston in 1911 and died in New Hampshire on December 31, 1995) was a Sinologist, linguist, and historian who taught at Harvard University, and was the founder of Sino-Mongolian studies in America.

Career Francis Woodman Cleaves At Harvard Cleaves received his undergraduate degree in Classics from Dartmouth College, and then enrolled in the graduate program in Comparative Philology at Harvard, but transferred to the study of Far Eastern Languages under Serge Elisséeff in the mid-1930s, prior to the formal establishment of the department.Francis Cleaves, Harvard University Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, History of the Department. In 1935, on a fellowship from the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Cleaves went first to Paris, where he studied Mongolian and other Central Asian languages with the Sinologist Paul Pelliot for three years, then to Beijing where he studied with the Mongolist Antoine Mostaert S.J. Always an avid book collector, he also roamed the stalls and shops in Liulichang, the street for books and antiques. There he accumulated an extensive collection not only in Chinese and Mongolian, his own interests, but also in Manchu, which he did not plan to use himself. The books in Manchu were particularly rare and form the core of Harvard's Manchu collection.Mark Elliott, \\"Highlights of the Manchu-Mongol Collection,\\" in Patrick Hanan. ed., Treasures of the Yenching: Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Harvard-Yenching Library. (Cambridge, Massachusetts; Hong Kong: Harvard-Yenching Library, 2003), pp. 79-81. Cleaves returned to Harvard in 1941 and taught Chinese in the Department of Far Eastern Languages as well as worked on the Harvard-Yenching Institute Chinese-English dictionary project. In the following year he received his Ph.D. with a dissertation entitled “A Sino-Mongolian Inscription on 1362,” and offered Harvard’s first course on the Mongolian language. Cleaves enlisted in the United States Navy and served in the Pacific. After the war ended, he helped to relocate Japanese citizens who had lived in China back to Japan and sorted through the books they left behind to find those suitable for shipping to the Harvard-Yenching Library. In 1946, Cleaves returned to Harvard and proceeded to teach Chinese and Mongolian, without interruption, for the next thirty-five years. He is unique for being the only professor in the history of the department never to take a sabbatical. He trained his students in the traditional European sinology of his mentors. Among his best-known disciples were Joseph Fletcher, the distinguished Mongolist and historian, and Elizabeth Endicott-West, author of basic studies on the Yuan dynasty and History of Mongolia.Bettine Birge, \\"Yuan studies in North America: historical overview, contributions, and current trends,\\" in Haihui Zhang. A Scholarly Review of Chinese Studies in North America (Ann Arbor, MI.: Association for Asian Studies, 2013). . pp. 55-56 . Cleaves had an especially close relation with William Hung, a preeminent scholar who had become his friend and mentor when they met in China in the 1930s. A mutual friend recalled that Cleaves was \\"an old-fashioned gentleman perhaps more at home with his cows, horses, and fellow farmers in New Hampshire than with the academic intrigues of Cambridge,\\" while Hung was a \\"pragmatic Confucianist.\\" The two would meet every weekday at three to sip tea and perhaps read from the Chinese classics or dynastic histories. Cleaves introduced Hung to the Mongol histories, and Hung published several articles in this field. Hung's article on the Secret History of the Mongols, however, drew conclusions which Cleaves did not feel were correct. Out of respect for his friend, Cleaves did not publish his own translation until 1985, after Hung's death., pp. 202-203. The copyright page of Cleaves' translation notes \\"the work was completed in 1956 and set in type in 1957,\\" but \\"for personal reasons it was set aside and not published until the present.\\" Cleaves was renowned for his meticulously annotated translations of Chinese and Old Mongolian texts, and consistently emphasized literal philological accuracy over aesthetic beauty. He published over seventy books and articles, many of which were on bilingual Sino- Mongolian stele inscriptions from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. His largest project was a complete annotated translation of the Secret History of the Mongols, of which only the first volume was ever published. In order to give readers the flavor of the original, Cleaves restricted the vocabulary to words used in Elizabethan English, a decision which made the text hard for some readers to comprehend.Timothy May, Review Rachewiltz's translation of Secret History September 2004 In 1984, Paul Kahn published a translation based on Cleaves but using contemporary English.Paul Kahn. The Secret History of the Mongols: The Origin of Chinghis Khan: An Adaptation of the Yuan Ch'ao Pi Shih, Based Primarily on the English Translation by Francis Woodman Cleaves. (San Francisco: North Point Press; reprinted Boston: Cheng & Tsui, 1998. ). A deeply committed teacher, Cleaves reluctantly retired in 1980, and continued his scholarship on Mongolian history. Much of his work, including notes on the remaining sections of the Secret History and manuscripts for dozens of additional articles, remained unpublished at the time of his death in 1995.

It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal is connected to the vacuum booster which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder, which applies a compressive force to a liquid (hydraulic or brake fluid) and forces it through the brake lines to the brake calipers. The liquid pushes the brake calipers, which in the case of disc brakes, push against the brake rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels. In drum brakes, pistons push two shoes against the brake drum accomplishing the same effect. Components =Vacuum booster= A cutaway view of the inside of the vacuum booster assembly The vacuum booster was invented in 1927 in order to provide a shorter stopping distance. Vacuum boosters provide brake assist for the driver by multiplying the force out of the booster creating more than the force that was used to push on the brake pedal. The booster works by pulling the air out of the booster chamber with a pump creating a low pressure system inside. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the input rod on the booster is pushed in which lets atmospheric pressure into the booster. This, in turn, pushes the diaphragm toward the master cylinder. =Master cylinder= An animation of how the master cylinder works along with how the force is transferred to the brake calipers The master cylinder is located behind the driver’s side dashboard mounted on the vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the master cylinder is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached to the top of the master cylinder). =Brake calipers= Often used in disc brakes, the brake calipers consists of one to two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel pistons (caliper pistons). Brake calipers are one of the most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop. The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together. =Drum brakes= The inside of a drum brake with the drum removed to show the internal mechanisms Another type of power brake installed in automobiles is called the drum brake. This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works is there is a brake cylinder that connects master cylinder to the drum brake via brake lines that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the brake pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the drum of the brake to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this brake is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk brake is located at the front of the vehicle. A car may also have only drum brakes or disc brakes both front and rear.

Film career Douglass produced and acted in the film The Amendment. In the film, Douglass portrayed his own father, who had been murdered in 1979. The Amendment is a film based on the October 15, 1979 murder of his parents, Dr. Richard Douglass, Marilyn Sue Douglass, and the attempted murders of Brooks and his sister Leslie. His father served as pastor of Putnam City Baptist Church and the family resided in Okarche, Oklahoma. Two drifters, Glen Ake and Steven Hatch entered their home, tied the family, including Brooks—then 16—stole $43, then took 12-year-old Leslie into the bedroom where Ake then Hatch both raped her. They then shot all four family members killing the parents and leaving the two siblings for dead.

On February 1, 1919, two new agencies were formed in addition to the Ports Authority - the Pilots, Lighthouses and Aids to Navigation Authority office and the Board of Waterways, Ports’ Dredging and Repair office. On March 1, 1920, the previously established agencies were united into a new agency - the General Authority of Maritime Issues - which was subordinate to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. On 22 May 1922, the General Authority of Maritime Issues was subordinated to the Ministry of Roads. On July 1, 1929, the agency was reformed into the Waterways Authority, which was tasked with organizing ship traffic at Estonian seas and inland waterways, preparing new development projects for ports and maintenance plans for waterways, and technical inspection and management of Estonian merchant fleet. The Waterways Authority was renamed the Waterways Department on 8 April 1938. On 31 December 1940, after the Soviets had annexed Estonia, the agency was dissolved and its resources were transferred to the Estonian Shipping Company and Hydrography Service of the Soviet Union Navy. = 1990 - present = The decision to establish the Estonian Maritime Administration was made on December 1, 1989, and the agency was formed on 16 January 1990. The first statute of the Estonian Maritime Administration was approved on 29 April 1990, and the agency was tasked with preparing the Merchant Shipping Code, which was accepted on December 9, 1990. At the same time, the creation of the Estonian Ship Register began, which was approved on November 8, 1991. On 3 August 1993, an agreement was signed between Estonia and Russia for the transfer of hydrographic resources to Estonia, and on October 1, Estonia took over the responsibility of ensuring safe shipping in its waters. To fulfil its obligations, the icebreaker Tarmo was purchased in 1993. In the beginning, the main tasks of the organization included icebreaking, offering piloting services and fulfilling coast guard duties, like maritime rescue and oil pollution control. Between 1995 and 1996, those duties were transferred to other institutions. However, icebreaking duties were transferred back in 2000. On January 31, 1992, the Estonian Maritime Administration joined the International Maritime Organization. In January 1994, it joined the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities; in February 1997, the International Hydrographic Organization; and in March 2001, the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure. On July 1, 2005, Estonia became a signatory of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.

(fl. 1559-1577) was an English printer in London, known as a writer of popular and miscellaneous works. Life Before 1559 he had become a freeman of the Stationers' Company; on 24 August of that year he presented an apprentice of his own, and on 6 November obtained licenses for printing his first publication, a 'morning and .' From 1561 to 1571 his name occurs repeatedly in the Stationers' Registers as obtaining licenses for printing books and pamphlets, and as presenting apprentices. On several occasions he was fined for illegal printing of 'other men's copy,' and on 22 July 1561 a penalty of was imposed on him for unseemly words.' The last mention of him in the Stationers' Registers is under the year 1577, when with other printers he signed a petition to the queen against some monopolies in printing recently granted by her, and nothing is known of him after that date. He dwelt in Little Britain Street, described on his title-pages as 'without Aldersgate' or 'by Great S. Bartholomew's.' Works Awdelay's publications were consisted mainly of ballads, news sheets, and religious tracts. One of the most important books reprinted and published by him was Anthony Fitzherbert's Boke of Husbandry. In 1561 he published translations by Henry Bennet from German reformers. Many of his publications were of his own composition. One of the earliest of them was The Wonders of England, 1559, a folio sheet of eleven ten-line stanzas, relating to English historical events from the death of Edward VI to the accession of Elizabeth. Best known now is a little volume entitled The Fraternitye of Vacabondes, licensed about July 1561, and published by himself in 1565. It is an elaborate description of the habits and organisation of the beggars of the day. On the back of the title- page are some doggerel verses by the author. It was reprinted in 1565 and in 1575, and Thomas Harman's Caveat for Common Cursitors, a book on the same subject published in 1575, was indebted to it. Awdely was strongly opposed to Catholicism, and wrote some verses to warn against its delusions, as a preface to A briefe Treatise agaynst certayn Errors of the Romish Church, by Gregory Scot, published by him in 1574. Other works were : * Ecclesi. xx., Remember death and thou shalt never sinne, 30 April 1569 (sheet). * Cruel Assault of God's Fort, in verse (sheet). * Epitaphe upon Death of Mayster John Veron, preacher. Quod John Awdelay (fol. sheet), on John Véron. * A Godly Ditty or Prayer to be song unto God for the preservation of his Church, our Queene and Realme, against all Traytours, Rebels, and Papistical Enemies, by John Awdelay, 1570 (broadside). It is probable that the epitaphs of \\"Doctour Hodden\\" and \\"Masterr Fraunces Benyson\\", published by Awdely in 1570-1, were also written by him.

It has 640 learners and 28 teachers. Founded as Städtische Realschule mit Grundschule (Municipal High School with Primary School) during the colonial time of German South-West Africa in 1913 it is one of the oldest schools in Namibia. Namib High School (2014) History Swakopmund was founded in 1892 and received municipal status in 1909. The building behind the lighthouse was used as school for 30 children of German settlers until 1913. When it became too small for the rapidly growing settlement, the foundation of a new school building was laid on 22 February 1913. The building, which is still in use by the school and largely unaltered, was finished the same year, and on 18 October 1913 the Städtische Realschule mit Grundschule was inaugurated. There was no school in 1914 and 1915 due to the evacuation of Swakopmund in World War I. When the German troops capitulated in 1915, the South African Administration of South-West Africa took over the school. It was renamed Swakopmund Primary School in 1919. The secondary section of the school moved into new buildings that today house the Namib Primary School. In 1930 the school became a high school again and was named Reformrealgymnasium. The medium of instruction had been German since the school was founded. In 1947 it was replaced by English, but the school still attracted a considerable number of German and Afrikaans native children from outside town. English natives commuted by bus from the formerly British Walvis Bay south of Swakopmund. The school developed into one of the leading schools of South-West Africa. In 1976 due to the opening of the Rössing Uranium Mine a lot of development took place in Swakopmund and new schools were developed along cultural lines. The school, since its foundation exclusively for white children, became a German secondary school called the Deutsche Schule Swakopmund, and in 1980 the Deutsche Oberschule Swakopmund. When Namibia became independent in 1990 doors were opened for all Namibian citizens. The school changed its medium of instruction to English language with German as a compulsory subject. The school then changed its name to Namib High School on 7 July 1997, in reference to the Namib Desert within which Swakopmund is situated. Performance Namib High School is among the best-performing schools countrywide. It occupied rank 14 of the national A-level school results in both 2012 and 2013.

She splits time between a studio in Santa Ana, CA and NYC, where she has been represented by Hirschl & Adler Modern since her first exhibition in 2000. She is a MacArthur “Genius” Fellow, a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellow, an Annalee & Barnett Newman Foundation and Joan Mitchell Foundation grant recipient, among other awards. Biography Turk received her BA from Scripps College in 1983 and her MFA from the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1994. She launched the CA non-profit ET Projects in 2017 to launch community-based art experiences such as “Shoreline Project” and “Tipping Point.” In her studio practice, her work explores the tension of co-existing, yet opposing realities. Boundaries and definitions are revealed in this impossible paradox, for instance: the absence in the present, the contemporary in the traditional, the lightness in weight, the emptiness in mass, the fluidity of the solid, the long narrative of moments. The sculptures defy gravity in their intricately-carved forms. Inspired by the natural world, she references its myriad of elegant organic structures, a concept continuously developed and recycled in her sketchbooks. Activating many of the themes from sketchbook pages with ET Projects, Turk relies on community audience participation. The objective of the large-scale “moving” installations is to stimulate serendipitous collective memories, reminding us of the potential for civic joy, optimism and the potential of public grace.  Works  MarbleCage7-Elizabeth Turk ;Studio practice Asked about her choice of medium, Turk said that \\"marble found me. It is intrinsically beautiful and holds great history. Maintaining a contemporary voice in this traditional material is daunting. But marble is the pathway to connect my work to the past, to a larger story– human and geological...It's not an accident that I read the earth like a novel. I want this depth in the artwork I create. This is important– it's humbling. My work carries forward more than my singular vision, because of this history.\\" ;Community installations Shoreline Project premiered on November 3, 2018 in partnership with the Laguna Art Museum's annual Art & Nature Festival and the City of Laguna Beach. 1,000 participants moved with LED-lit umbrellas along the edge of the Pacific. Filmed by drones, the production revealed the undulations of a single organism, individuals coming together organically, as one form. Tipping Point is ET Projects’ second production, summer 2019 at the Catalina Island Museum. Inspired by the sounds of extinct birds (recordings archived at the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology), Turk developed an alphabet of symbols and participatory moments. The objective of the opening events was to prompt community reflections, at once serious and light, when facing difficult and overwhelming environmental topics. “Move as if you were the last of a species” was the prompt for the dancers launching the event. Participants lit candles to draw “that which they loved”. Filmed with long exposures and from above, post imagery unveils the impact. The potential of the traces we, as individuals and significantly as a community, leave behind. Selected exhibitions Shoreline Project .01 / Laguna Beach, CA 2018 alt= *Tipping Point (2019): ET Studios, a non-profit set up by Elizabeth Turk, and Elizabeth Turk introduce a new body of work Tipping Point. Turk's work on the exhibition Tipping Point began earlier last fall, 2018, during a month-long open studio/live exhibition ThinkLab LIVE .002 with Director of The Frank Doyle Arts Pavilion Tyler Stallings, at Orange Coast College. Highlighting various attributes of this continents’ birds, Turk developed an alphabet of symbols. Using these unique symbols, she explores the greater concept – Extinction. Tipping Point has three elements: **1- Echoes of Extinction: Inspired by recordings of extinct birds (cataloged by the Ornithology Lab at Cornell University) the sound waves take shape in evocative sculptural, \\"sound column\\" forms, juxtaposing the ephemeral with the eternal. **2- Migration Patterns: metal mazes laced with imagery are cut to create beautiful interactive moments. Where the audience becomes both victim and aggressor in the fate of our planet. **3- Are We Creating a Silence?: a community, interactive experience where participants investigate the unique personal traces we leave behind. *Shoreline Project (2018): ET Studios, a non-profit set up by Elizabeth Turk, produces the Shoreline Project as a community event in partnership with Laguna Art Museum. One thousand umbrellas with the image of seashell mandalas are lit using an LED shaft, and carried by volunteers who become the artwork itself. For 2.5 hours, community volunteers and 8 to 10 dance groups move to drum beats as the sun sets on Laguna Beach, CA. *Tensions (2015): the series juxtaposes carving with found natural elements such as worn river stones and wood in order to explore the inherent tensions between human temperament and the natural world. * Script (2014): a memorial to hand writing itself, lost in the overwhelming rise of the keyboard. This series is an elegant reminder of the direct calligraphic line of cursive. * Nature Memorial - Wings (2013): a series of five life-sized broken wings, made from Yule marble originally quarried for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. Installed then photographed in abandoned industrial environments surrounding Washington D.C., the work is a symbol for the end of the 20th century of the Platonic idea: \\"God gives wings to those who can't fly.\\" *X-Ray Mandalas (2013–present): part of this collection of experimental photography was acquired by the Phyllis and Ross Escalette Permanent Collection of Art and is housed at the Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus at Chapman University. Other pieces from the collection were recently installed at the Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego Health. * Cages (2012): artwork carved from a single block of marble into a line outlining the interior space of the once, solid rock. Suspending this marble Möbius strip above a stainless steel structure, the polished interior of the steel reflects the empty state of the block of stone. The material, which is no longer seen, gives weight/meaning to that which remains visible.

It is found in Russia (the southern part of Primorskii Territory) and Japan. The wingspan is 6.5–7 mm. There are two distinct forms, an aestival (summer) and autumnal form. The forewing of the aestival form is white, that of the autumnal form golden yellow. Adults are on wing from July to August in the southern part of the Primorskii Territory. The larvae feed on Alnus japonica, Castanea cretata and Quercus acutissima. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of an irregular blotch mine. It is made on a young leaf and extends from the apex of the leaf towards the base in an irregular blotch along the margin of the leaf. The blackish frass is ejected from the holes which are made on the lower side of the mine, but some is scattered in the mine. The larva may migrate from one leaf to another. When full-grown, the larva leaves the mine and spins a hammock-like cocoon on the lower side of the leaf. External links *A Review of the Lyonetiid Moths (Lepidoptera, Lyonetiidae): II.

The long-run cost curve is a cost function that models this minimum cost over time, meaning inputs are not fixed. Using the long-run cost curve, firms can scale their means of production to reduce the costs of producing the good.Fuss M.A. (1987) Production and Cost Functions. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London There are three principal cost functions (or 'curves') used in microeconomic analysis: * Long-run total cost (LRTC) is the cost function that represents the total cost of production for all goods produced. * Long- run average cost (LRAC) is the cost function that represents the average cost per unit of producing some good. * Long-run marginal cost (LRMC) is the cost function that represents the cost of producing one more unit of some good. The idealized \\"long run\\" for a firm refers to the absence of time-based restrictions on what inputs (such as factors of production) a firm can employ in its production technology. For example, a firm cannot build an additional factory in the short run, but this restriction does not apply in the long run. Because forecasting introduces complexity, firms typically assume that the long-run costs are based on the technology, information, and prices that the firm faces currently. The long-run cost curve does not try to anticipate changes in the firm, the technology, or the industry. It only reflects how costs would be different if there were no constraints on changing the inputs in the current period. An ideal cost curve assumes technical efficiency because a firm always has an incentive to be as technically efficient as possible. Firms have a variety of methods of using various amounts of inputs, and they select the lowest total cost method for any given amount of output (quantity produced). For example, if a micro-enterprise wanted to make a few pins, the cheapest way to do so might be to hire a jack-of-all-trades, buy a little scrap metal, and have him work on it at home. However, if a firm wanted to produce thousands of pins, the lowest total cost might be achieved by renting a factory, buying specialized equipment, and hiring an assembly line of factory workers to perform specialized actions at each stage of producing the pins. In the short run, the firm might not have time to rent a factory, buy specialized tools, and hire factory workers. In that case, the firm would not be able to achieve short-run minimum costs, but the long-run costs would be much less. The increase in choices about how to produce in the long run means that long-run costs are equal to or less than short run costs, ceteris paribus. The term curves does not necessarily mean the cost function has any curvature. However, many economic models assume that cost curves are differentiable so that the LRMC is well-defined. Traditionally, cost curves have quantity on the horizontal axis of the graph and cost on the vertical axis.

Jussi Kekkonen fought successfully in the Winter War in the direction of Kuhmo but lost his sight when he was wounded in the early stages of the Continuation War. Kekkonen was born in Iisalmi. He attended the Cadet School in the early 1930s and served as an officer in the Kuhmo border squad. Kekkonen was seen as a devoted and folk-like officer. In the Winter War In October 1939, a Separate Battalion 14 (Erillinen Pataljoona 14) was founded at the command site of the Kuhmo border squad at the Jämäs barracks, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frans Ilomäki. Lieutenant Jussi Kekkonen served as the leader of the second squad of the battalion. When the Winter War started, Kekkonen's squad was doing fortification work in Kalliojoki. The enemy, outnumbering the Finns, attacked the Finnish troops numbering about 50 at Lammasperä, and Kekkonen's squad was sent there as reinforcements. The Finns were already giving up their positions at Vääräjoki when Kekkonen assembled his troops in the counter-attack starting on 6 December 1939. The Vääräjoki positions were re-manned and the Russians withdrew behind Vääräjoki. The front guards were now located at Vääräjoki and the proper defense station at Tyrävaara. The Russians' new attack on 12 December brought them to the open fields at Tyrävaara. The group under Kekkonen's command, consisting of 270 men, attacked the Russians fortified in the Ranta house and the Kupsunen accommodation premises at Christmas Eve 1939. After a few hours of combat, the Russians started to withdraw towards the border, settling into position at Hukkajärvi near the Kiekinniemi house. With a group of 150 men, Kekkonen destroyed the remains of the Russian battalion still left at Kiekinniemi on 28 December, when the Russians were withdrawing across the border. Kekkonen's group concentrated on securing the Kiekinkoski area during January to March 1940. The group also participated in military intelligence and disturbance missions on the Rasti-Saunajärvi-Riihivaara road. In the Continuation War Promoted to Captain when the Continuation War started in summer 1941, Jussi Kekkonen served as the leader of the Kuhmo border squad at Rukajärvi. The Miinoa group (Osasto Miinoa) under Kekkonen's command moved across the border and conquered the villages of Miinoa and Luvajärvi with minor losses. The next target was the village of Kiimasjärvi where the Russians were known to be in position. Kekkonen started to move there with three groups and two machine guns. Near the village, the attackers ran into fortified Russian positions and failed to conquer the village. The Russians struck at the group's back and the group had to withdraw. The withdrawal became a retreat and the group disassembled when Kekkonen was severely wounded in a Russian ambush. Kekkonen and his envoy were found at a campfire when the terrain was being searched in the evening and Kekkonen was soon transported by aeroplane from Luvajärvi to the Kuhmo field hospital. Having been wounded in the eyes, Kekkonen's sight was beyond rescue. Lieutenant Taskinen, succeeding Kekkonen as the leader of the border squad, moved the squad to positions along a river west of the Luvajärvi village. After one week, the Lieksa border squad led by Captain Seitamo arrived. The attack at Kiimasjärvi was resumed, but attempts at conquering the heavily fortified village failed, until the Russians left the village themselves, being threatened from the back by Finnish troops on the Rukajärvi road. Before the Russians left the village, they set fire to it. After the war After being wounded, Kekkonen lost his sight permanently. He was promoted to Major, and after the war he served as a manager in the shipping company of Ragnar Nordström in Loviisa. Jussi Kekkonen died in Loviisa and was buried in a military hero grave in Kajaani. Sources * Did Kekkonen have brothers and sisters?

During her lifetime she widely exhibited at Parisian salons and British galleries, including at the Royal Academy of Arts. Three of her paintings are in Wolverhampton Art Gallery. Early life Sara Page was born in 1855 in Moxley, Staffordshire, the fourth of nine children to a successful timber merchant, Samuel Page and Sara Wells Page, whose father Thomas Wells (1804–1876) was a wealthy local Ironmaster. Sam Wells Page, Sara's brother, was official receiver for Wolverhampton and Walsall and a solicitor in the Midlands. Both parents died in the 1870s,Memorial at All Saints Church, Moxley leaving to their children a considerable fortune, which helped them to live independently. Between 1884 and 1891,Wolverhampton Local Studies. DX-831/4/1. Page studied drawing at Wolverhampton School of Art, and then studied the works of Renaissance masters in Italy. In 1892, after coming back from Italy, she exhibited at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists a painting Golden Venetian. Paris Sara Page arrived to Paris in about 1892 and studied with William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury, and Gabriel Ferrier of the Académie Julian. She exhibited at the 1893 Société des Artistes Français (SAF) exhibition. Page exhibited at the Société des Artistes Français, Paris Salon and the Royal Academy of Arts in London, which from 1892 through 1896 included portraits of members of her extended family. In the following years she continued to paint female portraits, such as: Beatrice (1899), Theodora (1903), Blondina (1914), Isobel (1915, 1916), Henriette (1935). Among other works, A Capri Maiden exhibited in Birmingham in 1894, and The Breton Peasant was shown in 1893–1894 at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. She received a medal for portrait painting. In 1897 she settled in Neuilly-sur- Seine, a wealthy residential suburb of Paris with a strong artistic atmosphere, and maintained her own studio there. She took additional lessons from the well-established artists and leading exponents of the academic style Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret and Gustave-Claude-Etienne Courtois who also lived in Neuilly-sur-Seine, and had their studio at 73, Boulevard Bineau. Her greatest success was the exhibiting the large-scale oil painting Andromeda at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts (SNBA) in 1902. In 1904 lived in Paris at 16, Avenue Niel and was identified as a miniature painter. Both Le rocher qui pleure (The Weeping Rock), exhibited in 1910, and Le Baigneuse (The Bather), exhibited in 1911 and 1935, are similar to Andromeda in style, composition, and technique. As such, they can be seen as good examples of the French academic style of Bouguereau, Dagnan-Bouveret, and Courtois. From about 1909, Page studied with the miniature painter Gabrielle Debillemont-Chardon, the President of the Société des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs and of the Société des Miniaturistes et des Arts Precieux. In 1910, she participated in the exhibition of miniatures at the George Petit Gallery, showing a picture of Dutch children. Her miniature works exhibited in 1921 at the Gallerie Brunner, were favourably reviewed in the journal Revue moderne des arts and de la vie. She exhibited at the Royal Academy, Walker Art Gallery, and Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. In 1926 she donated to Wolverhampton Art Gallery her 1902 painting Andromeda, in appreciation for the drawing instruction she received at the Wolverhampton School of Art. It was previously exhibited at the Paris Salon and its image was printed in Wolverhampton's Express & Star in January 1928. Later years Page returned to England about 1934. Her last years were spent with her sister Elizabeth Page in Parkstone, Dorset, where she died in 1943. In the same year, her sister Elizabeth donated to Wolverhampton Art Gallery a small portrait The Princess, in memory of her sister. The painting Whisper of Spring was given to the gallery in 1977. A few of her works are at the Poole Museum. Legacy Page is seen as a diligent artist who experimented with artistic techniques, followed established academic tradition, and was an exponent of the academic style in England. She did not develop a prominent professional career, but she was an example of a women from the late 19th- and early 20th-century who sought and acquired education, self-expression and an independent career.

During trials in 2006, a demonstrator vehicle fired a volley of ten 155 mm rounds in 2 minutes and 19 seconds with a crew of two being seated in the fully armoured protected cab.Janes.com: Krauss-Maffei Wegmann 155 mm/52 calibre Artillery Gun Module (AGM) (Germany), Self-propelled guns and howitzers (tracked) Other platforms = Donar = A further development of the AGM was revealed in 2008 as the Donar 155mm self-propelled artillery system. The system uses a modified ASCOD 2 IFV chassis with a newer, more efficient two-man turret with a fully automatic ammunition loading and handling system. =Boxer= In April 2014, KMW decided to integrate the AGM onto the Boxer armored vehicle, with the system making an appearance at Eurosatory in June 2014. The Boxer has to prove it can deal with recoil forces without stabilization, but stabilization concepts can be added if needed to retain shoot and scoot and 360 degree firing capability. The Boxer-AGM system could be used as an upgrade option for countries with existing boxer fleets. Test firings are scheduled for late 2014.KMW unveils AGM-mounted Boxer - Shephardmedia.com, 20 June 2014 As of 2019, firing trials with the turret traversed front and to its sides were carried out at WTD 41 proving ground and were successful without the use of stabilizers. The trials also demonstrated the ability to fire an 8-round burst and redeploy under 90 seconds, and carry out multi-round simultaneous impact missions. The combination of the Boxer vehicle with AGM became known as Remote Controlled Howitzer 155 (RCH 155) due to the turret module being remote controlled. Additionally, a remote weapons station with a .50 caliber machine gun has been fitted on the roof.  Potential customers  The Artillery Gun Module was a potential choice for the Israel Defense Forces as they seek to replace the M109 in their service. However, in 2017, it appeared that the IDF had selected a development of the ATMOS 2000 instead, possibly because they preferred a wholly Israeli produced system for legal reasons.Elbit selected to develop IDF artillery capability 4 Apr, 2017 19:27, Yuval Azulay  See also  * Panzerhaubitze 2000  References  External images * Artillerie Geschütz Modul * Artillery Gun Module (AGM) External links * Army- technology.com * Janes.com * Deutsche artillerie (in German) * Donar Self-propelled artillery of Germany Post–Cold War artillery of Germany 155 mm artillery Tracked self-propelled howitzers ","title":"Artillery Gun Module"},{"id":"28978331","text":"Dawid Bezuidenhout is a high school in the suburb of Khomasdal in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.

Nobility is a social class normally ranked immediately below royalty and found in some societies that have a formal aristocracy. Nobility possesses more acknowledged privileges and higher social status than most other classes in society. The privileges associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles, or may be largely honorary (e.g., precedence), and vary by country and era. Membership in the nobility, including rights and responsibilities, is typically hereditary. Membership in the nobility has historically been granted by a monarch or government. Nonetheless, acquisition of sufficient power, wealth, military prowess, or royal favour has occasionally enabled commoners to ascend into the nobility. There are often a variety of ranks within the noble class. Legal recognition of nobility has been more common in monarchies, but nobility also existed in such regimes as the Dutch Republic (1581–1795), the Republic of Genoa (1005–1815), the Republic of Venice (697–1797), and the Old Swiss Confederacy (1300–1798), and remains part of the legal social structure of some non-hereditary regimes, e.g., San Marino, and the Vatican City in Europe. Hereditary titles and styles added to names (such as \\"Prince\\" or \\"Lord\\" or \\"Lady\\"), as well as honorifics often distinguish nobles from non-nobles in conversation and written speech. In many nations most of the nobility have been un-titled, and some hereditary titles do not indicate nobility (e.g., vidame). Some countries have had non- hereditary nobility, such as the Empire of Brazil or life peers in the United Kingdom. History Nobility offered protection in exchange for service French aristocrats, c. 1774 The term derives from Latin nobilitas, the abstract noun of the adjective nobilis (\\"noble but also secondarily well- known, famous, notable\\"). In ancient Roman society, nobiles originated as an informal designation for the political governing class who had allied interests, including both patricians and plebeian families (gentes) with an ancestor who had risen to the consulship through his own merit (see novus homo, \\"new man\\"). In modern usage, \\"nobility\\" is applied to the highest social class in pre-modern societies, excepting the ruling dynasty. In the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were generally those who held a fief, often land or office, under vassalage, i.e., in exchange for allegiance and various, mainly military, services to a suzerain, who might be a higher- ranking nobleman or a monarch. It rapidly came to be seen as a hereditary caste, sometimes associated with a right to bear a hereditary title and, for example in pre-revolutionary France, enjoying fiscal and other privileges. While noble status formerly conferred significant privileges in most jurisdictions, by the 21st century it had become a largely honorary dignity in most societies, although a few, residual privileges may still be preserved legally (e.g., Netherlands, Spain, UK) and some Asian, Pacific and African cultures continue to attach considerable significance to formal hereditary rank or titles. (Compare the entrenched position and leadership expectations of the nobility of the Kingdom of Tonga.) Nobility is a historical, social and often legal notion, differing from high socio-economic status in that the latter is mainly based on income, possessions or lifestyle. Being wealthy or influential cannot ipso facto make one noble, nor are all nobles wealthy or influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the 'poor nobleman' is almost as old as nobility itself). Various republics, including former Iron Curtain countries, Greece, Mexico, and Austria have expressly abolished the conferral and use of titles of nobility for their citizens. This is distinct from countries which have not abolished the right to inherit titles, but which do not grant legal recognition or protection to them, such as Germany and Italy, although Germany recognizes their use as part of the legal surname. Still other countries and authorities allow their use, but forbid attachment of any privilege thereto, e.g., Finland, Norway and the European Union, while French law also protects lawful titles against usurpation. Although many societies have a privileged upper class with substantial wealth and power, the status is not necessarily hereditary and does not entail a distinct legal status, nor differentiated forms of address. In the United States, establishment of a nobility is prohibited by the Title of Nobility Clause of the country's constitution. Noble privileges feudal society (1789). The rural third estate carries the clergy and the nobility. Not all of the benefits of nobility derived from noble status per se. Usually privileges were granted or recognised by the monarch in association with possession of a specific title, office or estate. Most nobles' wealth derived from one or more estates, large or small, that might include fields, pasture, orchards, timberland, hunting grounds, streams, etc. It also included infrastructure such as castle, well and mill to which local peasants were allowed some access, although often at a price. Nobles were expected to live \\"nobly\\", that is, from the proceeds of these possessions. Work involving manual labour or subordination to those of lower rank (with specific exceptions, such as in military or ecclesiastic service) was either forbidden (as derogation from noble status) or frowned upon socially. On the other hand, membership in the nobility was usually a prerequisite for holding offices of trust in the realm and for career promotion, especially in the military, at court and often the higher functions in the government, judiciary and church. Prior to the French Revolution, European nobles typically commanded tribute in the form of entitlement to cash rents or usage taxes, labour or a portion of the annual crop yield from commoners or nobles of lower rank who lived or worked on the noble's manor or within his seigneurial domain. In some countries, the local lord could impose restrictions on such a commoner's movements, religion or legal undertakings. Nobles exclusively enjoyed the privilege of hunting. In France, nobles were exempt from paying the taille, the major direct tax. Peasants were not only bound to the nobility by dues and services, but the exercise of their rights was often also subject to the jurisdiction of courts and police from whose authority the actions of nobles were entirely or partially exempt. In some parts of Europe the right of private war long remained the privilege of every noble. During the early Renaissance, duelling established the status of a respectable gentleman, and was an accepted manner of resolving disputes. Since the end of World War I the hereditary nobility entitled to special rights has largely been abolished in the Western World as intrinsically discriminatory, and discredited as inferior in efficiency to individual meritocracy in the allocation of societal resources. Nobility came to be associated with social rather than legal privilege, expressed in a general expectation of deference from those of lower rank. By the 21st century even that deference had become increasingly minimised. Ennoblement Hungarian hussar troops set up by the Hungarian nobility, during the Austro–Turkish War of 1787–1791. In France, a seigneurie (lordship) might include one or more manors surrounded by land and villages subject to a noble's prerogatives and disposition. Seigneuries could be bought, sold or mortgaged. If erected by the crown into, e.g., a barony or countship, it became legally entailed for a specific family, which could use it as their title. Yet most French nobles were untitled (\\"seigneur of Montagne\\" simply meant ownership of that lordship but not, if one was not otherwise noble, the right to use a title of nobility, as commoners often purchased lordships). Only a member of the nobility who owned a countship was allowed, ipso facto, to style himself as its comte, although this restriction came to be increasingly ignored as the ancien régime drew to its close. In other parts of Europe, sovereign rulers arrogated to themselves the exclusive prerogative to act as fons honorum within their realms. For example, in the United Kingdom royal letters patent are necessary to obtain a title of the peerage, which also carries nobility and formerly a seat in the House of Lords, but never came without automatic entail of land nor rights to the local peasants' output. Rank within the nobility Polish magnates 1576–1586 Polish magnates 1697–1795 Nobility might be either inherited or conferred by a fons honorum. It is usually an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary, i.e. the status descends exclusively to some or all of the legitimate, and usually male-line, descendants of a nobleman. In this respect, the nobility as a class has always been much more extensive than the primogeniture-based titled nobility, which included peerages in France and in the United Kingdom, grandezas in Portugal and Spain, and some noble titles in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Scandinavia. In Russia, Scandinavia and non-Prussian Germany, titles usually descended to all male-line descendants of the original titleholder, including females. In Spain, noble titles are now equally heritable by females and males. Noble estates, on the other hand, gradually came to descend by primogeniture in much of western Europe aside from Germany. In Eastern Europe, by contrast, with the exception of a few Hungarian estates, they usually descended to all sons or even all children.The consolidation of Noble Power in Europe, c. 1600–1800 In France, some wealthy bourgeois, most particularly the members of the various parlements, were ennobled by the king, constituting the noblesse de robe. The old nobility of landed or knightly origin, the noblesse d'épée, increasingly resented the influence and pretensions of this parvenu nobility. In the last years of the ancien régime the old nobility pushed for restrictions of certain offices and orders of chivalry to noblemen who could demonstrate that their lineage had extended \\"quarterings\\", i.e. several generations of noble ancestry, to be eligible for offices and favours at court along with nobles of medieval descent, although historians such as William Doyle have disputed this so-called \\"Aristocratic Reaction\\".W. Doyle, Essays on Eighteenth Century France, London, 1995 Various court and military positions were reserved by tradition for nobles who could \\"prove\\" an ancestry of at least seize quartiers (16 quarterings), indicating exclusively noble descent (as displayed, ideally, in the family's coat of arms) extending back five generations (all 16 great-great grandparents). Nicholaus Eszterházy of Galántha (1583–1645) This illustrates the traditional link in many countries between heraldry and nobility; in those countries where heraldry is used, nobles have almost always been armigerous, and have used heraldry to demonstrate their ancestry and family history. However, heraldry has never been restricted to the noble classes in most countries, and being armigerous does not necessarily demonstrate nobility. Scotland, however, is an exception.An opinion of Innes of Learney differentiates the system in use in Scotland from many other European traditions, in that armorial bearings which are entered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland by warrant of the Lord Lyon King of Arms are legally \\"Ensigns of Nobility\\", and although the historical accuracy of that interpretation has been challenged, Innes of Learney's perspective is accepted in the Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia entry, 'Heraldry' (Volume 11), 3, The Law of Arms. 1613. The nature of arms. In a number of recent cases in Scotland the Lord Lyon King of Arms has controversially (vis-à-vis Scotland's Salic law) granted the arms and allocated the chiefships of medieval noble families to female-line descendants of lords, even when they were not of noble lineage in the male line, while persons of legitimate male-line descent may still survive (e.g. the modern Chiefs of Clan MacLeod). In some nations, hereditary titles, as distinct from noble rank, were not always recognised in law, e.g., Poland's Szlachta. European ranks of nobility lower than baron or its equivalent, are commonly referred to as the petty nobility, although baronets of the British Isles are deemed titled gentry. Most nations traditionally had an untitled lower nobility in addition to titled nobles. An example is the landed gentry of the British Isles.Ruling of the Court of the Lord Lyon (26/2/1948, Vol. IV, page 26): \\"With regard to the words 'untitled nobility' employed in certain recent birthbrieves in relation to the (Minor) Baronage of Scotland, Finds and Declares that the (Minor) Barons of Scotland are, and have been both in this nobiliary Court and in the Court of Session recognised as a ‘titled nobility’ and that the estait of the Baronage (i.e., Barones Minores) are of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\\". This title is not, however, a peerage, thus Scotland's noblesse ranks in England as gentry. Unlike England's gentry, the Junkers of Germany, the noblesse de robe of France, the hidalgos of Spain and the nobili of Italy were explicitly acknowledged by the monarchs of those countries as members of the nobility, although untitled. In Scandinavia, the Benelux nations and Spain there are still untitled as well as titled families recognised in law as noble. In Hungary members of the nobility always theoretically enjoyed the same rights. In practice, however, a noble family's financial assets largely defined its significance. Medieval Hungary's concept of nobility originated in the notion that nobles were \\"free men\\", eligible to own land.Ölyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemességi könyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 45p. This basic standard explains why the noble population was relatively large, although the economic status of its members varied widely. Untitled nobles were not infrequently wealthier than titled families, while considerable differences in wealth were also to be found within the titled nobility. The custom of granting titles was introduced to Hungary in the 16th century by the House of Habsburg. Historically, once nobility was granted, if a nobleman served the monarch well he might obtain the title of baron, and might later be elevated to the rank of count. As in other countries of post-medieval central Europe, hereditary titles were not attached to a particular land or estate but to the noble family itself, so that all patrilineal descendants shared a title of baron or count (cf. peerage). Neither nobility nor titles could be transmitted through women.Ölyvedi Vad Imre. (1930) Nemességi könyv. Koroknay-Nyomda. Szeged, Hungary. 85.p Some con artists sell fake titles of nobility, often with impressive-looking documentation. This may be illegal, depending on local law. They are more often illegal in countries that actually have nobilities, such as European monarchies. In the United States, such commerce may constitute actionable fraud rather than criminal usurpation of an exclusive right to use of any given title by an established class. Other terms Count Carl Robert Mannerheim (1835–1914), a Finnish aristocrat, businessman, and the father of Baron C. G. E. Mannerheim, the Marshal of Finland \\"Aristocrat\\" and aristocracy, in modern usage, refer colloquially and broadly to persons who inherit elevated social status, whether due to membership in the (formerly) official nobility or the monied upper class. Blue blood is an English idiom recorded since 1811 in the Annual Register and in 1834 for noble birth or descent; it is also known as a translation of the Spanish phrase sangre azul, which described the Spanish royal family and high nobility who claimed to be of Visigothic descent,The politics of aristocratic empires by John Kautsky in contrast to the Moors. The idiom originates from ancient and medieval societies of Europe and distinguishes an upper class (whose superficial veins appeared blue through their untanned skin) from a working class of the time. The latter consisted mainly of agricultural peasants who spent most of their time working outdoors and thus had tanned skin, through which superficial veins appear less prominently. Robert Lacey explains the genesis of the blue blood concept: > It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's > blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around > the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on > horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred > years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, > and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to > display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that > his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy.Robert Lacey, > Aristocrats. Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67 Europe Russian boyars European nobility originated in the feudal/seignorial system that arose in Europe during the Middle Ages.Karl Ferdinand Werner, Naissance de la noblesse. L'essor des élites politiques en Europe. Fayard, Paris 1998, . Originally, knights or nobles were mounted warriors who swore allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him in exchange for an allocation of land (usually together with serfs living thereon). During the period known as the Military Revolution, nobles gradually lost their role in raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies. The Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Large numbers of English nobility perished in the Wars of the Roses This was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the Renaissance and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the Industrial Revolution. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, the bourgeoisie gradually grew in power; a rich city merchant came to be more influential than a nobleman, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles. However, in many countries at this time, the nobility retained substantial political importance and social influence: for instance, the United Kingdom's government was dominated by the (unusually small) nobility until the middle of the 19th century. Thereafter the powers of the nobility were progressively reduced by legislation. However, until 1999, all hereditary peers were entitled to sit and vote in the House of Lords. Since then, only 92 of them have this entitlement, of whom 90 are elected by the hereditary peers as a whole to represent the peerage. The countries with the highest proportion of nobles were Castile (probably 10%), Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (15% of an 18th-century population of 800,000), Spain (722,000 in 1768 which was 7–8% of the entire population) and other countries with lower percentages, such as Russia in 1760 with 500,000–600,000 nobles (2–3% of the entire population), and pre-revolutionary France where there were no more than 300,000 prior to 1789, which was 1% of the population (although some scholars believe this figure is an overestimate). In 1718 Sweden had between 10,000 and 15,000 nobles, which was 0.5% of the population. In Germany it was 0.01%. In the Kingdom of Hungary nobles made up 5% of the population. All the nobles in 18th-century Europe numbered perhaps 3–4 million out of a total of 170–190 million inhabitants. By contrast, in 1707, when England and Scotland united into Great Britain, there were only 168 English peers, and 154 Scottish ones, though their immediate families were recognised as noble.Farnborough, T.

Apart from the hierarchy of noble titles, in England rising through baron, viscount, earl, and marquess to duke, many countries had categories at the top or bottom of the nobility. The gentry, relatively small landowners with perhaps one or two villages, were mostly noble in most countries, for example the Polish landed gentry, but not in others, such as the English equivalent. At the top, Poland had a far smaller class of \\"magnates\\", who were hugely rich and politically powerful. In other countries the small groups of Spanish Grandee or Peer of France had great prestige but little additional power.

Emperor Farrukhsiyar Bestows a Jewel on a Nobleman =India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal= In the Indian Subcontinent during the British Raj, many members of the nobility were elevated to royalty as they became the monarchs of their princely states and vice versa as many princely state rulers were reduced from royals to noble Zamindars. Hence, many nobles in the subcontinent had royal titles of Raja, Rai, Rana, Rao, etc. In Nepal, Kaji () was a title and position used by nobility of Gorkha Kingdom (1559–1768) and Kingdom of Nepal (1768–1846). Historian Mahesh Chandra Regmi suggests that Kaji is derived from Sanskrit word Karyi which meant functionary. Other noble and aristocratic titles were Thakur, Sardar, Dewan, Pradhan, Kaji etc. =China= In East Asia the system was often modelled on imperial China, the leading culture. Emperors conferred titles of nobility. Imperial descendants formed the highest class of ancient Chinese nobility, their status based upon the rank of the empress or concubine from which they descend maternally (as emperors were polygamous). Numerous titles such as Taizi (crown prince), and equivalents of \\"prince\\" were accorded, and due to complexities in dynastic rules, rules were introduced for Imperial descendants. The titles of the junior princes were gradually lowered in rank by each generation while the senior heir continued to inherit their father's titles. It was a custom in China for the new dynasty to ennoble and enfeoff a member of the dynasty which they overthrew with a title of nobility and a fief of land so that they could offer sacrifices to their ancestors, in addition to members of other preceding dynasties. China had a feudal system in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, which gradually gave way to a more bureaucratic one beginning in the Qin dynasty (221 BC). This continued through the Song dynasty, and by its peak power shifted from nobility to bureaucrats. This development was gradual and generally only completed in full by the Song dynasty. In the Han dynasty, for example, even though noble titles were no longer given to those other than the Emperor's relatives, the fact that the process of selecting officials was mostly based on a vouching system by current officials as officials usually vouched for their own sons or those of other officials meant that a de facto aristocracy continued to exist. This process was further deepened during the Three Kingdoms period with the introduction of the Nine-rank system. By the Sui dynasty, however, the institution of the Imperial examination system marked the transformation of a power shift towards a full bureaucracy, though the process would not be truly completed until the Song dynasty. Titles of nobility became symbolic along with a stipend while governance of the country shifted to scholar officials. In the Qing dynasty titles of nobility were still granted by the emperor, but served merely as honorifics based on a loose system of favours to the Qing emperor. Under a centralized system, the empire's governance was the responsibility of the Confucian-educated scholar-officials and the local gentry, while the literati were accorded gentry status. For male citizens, advancement in status was possible via garnering the top three positions in imperial examinations. The Qing appointed the Ming imperial descendants to the title of Marquis of Extended Grace. The oldest held continuous noble title in Chinese history was that held by the descendants of Confucius, as Duke Yansheng, which was renamed as the Sacrificial Official to Confucius in 1935 by the Republic of China. The title is held by Kung Tsui-chang. There is also a \\"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\\" for a descendant of Mencius, a \\"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\\" for a descendant of Zengzi, and a \\"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\\" for a descendant of Yan Hui. The bestowal of titles was abolished upon the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, as part of a larger effort to remove feudal influences and practises from Chinese society. =Islamic world= In some Islamic countries, there are no definite noble titles (titles of hereditary rulers being distinct from those of hereditary intermediaries between monarchs and commoners). Persons who can trace legitimate descent from Muhammad or the clans of Quraysh, as can members of several present or formerly reigning dynasties, are widely regarded as belonging to the ancient, hereditary Islamic nobility. In some Islamic countries they inherit (through mother or father) hereditary titles, although without any other associated privilege, e.g., variations of the title Sayyid and Sharif. Regarded as more religious than the general population, many people turn to them for clarification or guidance in religious matters. In Iran, historical titles of the nobility including Mirza, Khan, ed-Dowleh and Shahzada (\\"Son of a Shah), are now no longer recognised. An aristocratic family is now recognised by their family name, often derived from the post held by their ancestors, considering the fact that family names in Iran only appeared in the beginning of the 20th century. Sultans have been an integral part of Islamic history . During the Ottoman Empire in the Imperial Court and the provinces there were many Ottoman titles and appellations forming a somewhat unusual and complex system in comparison with the other Islamic countries. The bestowal of noble and aristocratic titles was widespread across the empire even after its fall by independent monarchs. One of the most elaborate examples is that of the Egyptian aristocracy's largest clan, the Abaza family. =Japan= Japanese samurai, 1798 Medieval Japan developed a feudal system similar to the European system, where land was held in exchange for military service. The daimyō class, or hereditary landowning nobles, held great socio-political power. As in Europe, they commanded private armies made up of samurai, an elite warrior class; for long periods, these held the real power without a real central government, and often plunged the country into a state of civil war. The daimyō class can be compared to European peers, and the samurai to European knights, but important differences exist. Feudal title and rank were abolished during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and was replaced by the kazoku, a five-rank peerage system after the British example, which granted seats in the upper house of the Imperial Diet; this ended in 1947 following Japan's defeat in World War II. =Philippines= Like other Southeast Asian countries, many regions in the Philippines have indigenous nobility, partially influenced by Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic custom. Since ancient times, Datu was the common title of a chief or monarch of the many pre-colonial principalities and sovereign dominions throughout the isles; in some areas the term Apo was also used.The Olongapo Story, July 28, 1953 – Bamboo Breeze – Vol.6, No.3 With the titles Sultan and Rajah, Datu (and its Malay cognate, Datok) are currently used in some parts of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. These titles are the rough equivalents of European titles, albeit dependent on the actual wealth and prestige of the bearer. Recognition by the Spanish Crown Upon the islands' Christianisation, the datus retained governance of their territories despite annexation to the Spanish Empire. In a law signed 11 June 1594,\\"It is not right that the Indian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly lords. In all else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which pertains to their encomenderos.\\" Felipe II, Ley de Junio 11, 1594 in Recapilación de leyes, lib. vi, tit. VII, ley xvi. Also cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493–1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XVI, pp. 155-156. King Philip II of Spain ordered that the indigenous rulers continue to receive the same honours and privileges accorded them prior their conversion to Catholicism. The baptised nobility subsequently coalesced into the exclusive, landed ruling class of the lowlands known as the Principalía.SCOTT, William Henry (1982).

On 22 March 1697, King Charles II of Spain confirmed the privileges granted by his predecessors (in Title VII, Book VI of the Laws of the Indies)Recopilación de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias to indigenous nobilities of the Crown colonies, including the Principales of the Philippines, and extended to them and to their descendants the preeminence and honors customarily attributed to the Hidalgos of Castile.Por cuanto teniendo presentes las leyes y cédulas que se mandaron despachar por los Señores Reyes mis progenitores y por mí, encargo el buen tratamiento, amparo, protección y defensa de los indios naturales de la América, y que sean atendidos, mantenidos, favorecidos y honrados como todos los demás vasallos de mi Corona, y que por el trascurso del tiempo se detiene la práctica y uso de ellas, y siento tan conveniente su puntual cumplimiento al bien público y utilidad de los Indios y al servicio de Dios y mío, y que en esta consecuencia por lo que toca a los indios mestizos está encargo a los Arzobispos y Obispos de las Indias, por la Ley Siete, Título Siete, del Libro Primero, de la Recopilación, los ordenen de sacerdotes, concurriendo las calidades y circunstancias que en ella se disponen y que si algunas mestizas quisieren ser religiosas dispongan el que se las admita en los monasterios y a las profesiones, y aunque en lo especial de que quedan ascender los indios a puestos eclesiásticos o seculares, gubernativos, políticos y de guerra, que todos piden limpieza de sangre y por estatuto la calidad de nobles, hay distinción entre los Indios y mestizos, o como descendentes de los indios principales que se llaman caciques, o como procedidos de indios menos principales que son los tributarios, y que en su gentilidad reconocieron vasallaje, se considera que a los primeros y sus descendentes se les deben todas las preeminencias y honores, así en lo eclesiástico como en lo secular que se acostumbran conferir a los nobles Hijosdalgo de Castilla y pueden participar de cualesquier comunidades que por estatuto pidan nobleza, pues es constante que estos en su gentilismo eran nobles a quienes sus inferiores reconocían vasallaje y tributaban, cuya especie de nobleza todavía se les conserva y considera, guardándoles en lo posible, o privilegios, como así se reconoce y declara por todo el Título de los caciques, que es el Siete, del Libro Seis, de la Recopilación, donde por distinción de los indios inferiores se les dejó el señorío con nombre de cacicazgo, transmisible de mayor en mayor, a sus posterioridades...

Madrid: HIDALGUIA, pp. 234-235. Filipino nobles during the Spanish era The Laws of the Indies and other pertinent Royal Decrees were enforced in the Philippines and benefited many indigenous nobles. It can be seen very clearly and irrefutably that, during the colonial period, indigenous chiefs were equated with the Spanish Hidalgos, and the most resounding proof of the application of this comparison is the General Military Archive in Segovia, where the qualifications of \\"Nobility\\" (found in the Service Records) are attributed to those Filipinos who were admitted to the Spanish Military Academies and whose ancestors were caciques, encomenderos, notable Tagalogs, chieftains, governors or those who held positions in the municipal administration or government in all different regions of the large islands of the Archipelago, or of the many small islands of which it is composed.Por ella se aprecia bien claramente y de manera fehaciente que a los caciques indígenas se les equiparada a los Hidalgos españoles y la prueba más rotunda de su aplicación se halla en el Archivo General Militar de Segovia, en donde las calificaciones de «Nobleza» se encuentran en las Hojas de Servicio de aquellos filipinos que ingresaron en nuestras Academias Militares y cuyos ascendientes eran caciques, encomenderos, tagalos notables, pedáneos, por los gobernadores o que ocupan cargos en la Administración municipal o en la del Gobierno, de todas las diferentes regiones de las grandes islas del Archipiélago o en las múltiples islas pequeñas de que se compone el mismo.

In the context of the ancient tradition and norms of Castilian nobility, all descendants of a noble are considered noble, regardless of fortune.Ceballos-Escalera y Gila, Alfonso, ed. (2016).

Exhibit in the Villa Escudero Museum, San Pablo, Laguna. At the Real Academia de la Historia, there is a substantial number of records providing reference to the Philippine Islands, and while most parts correspond to the history of these islands, the Academia did not exclude among its documents the presence of many genealogical records. The archives of the Academia and its royal stamp recognized the appointments of hundreds of natives of the Philippines who, by virtue of their social position, occupied posts in the administration of the territories and were classified as \\"nobles\\".Por otra parte, mientras en las Indias la cultura precolombiana había alcanzado un alto nivel, en Filipinas la civilización isleña continuaba manifestándose en sus estados más primitivos. Sin embargo, esas sociedades primitivas, independientes totalmente las unas de las otras, estaban en cierta manera estructuradas y se apreciaba en ellas una organización jerárquica embrionaria y local, pero era digna de ser atendida. Precisamente en esa organización local es, como siempre, de donde nace la nobleza. El indio aborigen, jefe de tribu, es reconocido como noble y las pruebas irrefutables de su nobleza se encuentran principalmente en las Hojas de Servicios de los militares de origen filipino que abrazaron la carrera de las Armas, cuando para hacerlo necesariamente era preciso demostrar el origen nobiliario del individuo.

Madrid: HIDALGUIA. , p. 232. The presence of these notables demonstrates the cultural concern of Spain in those Islands to prepare the natives and the collaboration of these in the government of the Archipelago. This aspect of Spanish rule in the Philippines appears much more strongly implemented than in the Americas. Hence in the Philippines, the local nobility, by reason of charge accorded to their social class, acquired greater importance than in the Indies of the New World.También en la Real Academia de la Historia existe un importante fondo relativo a las Islas Filipinas, y aunque su mayor parte debe corresponder a la Historia de ellas, no es excluir que entre su documentación aparezcan muchos antecedentes genealógicos… El Archivo del Palacio y en su Real Estampilla se recogen los nombramientos de centenares de aborígenes de aquel Archipiélago, a los cuales, en virtud de su posición social, ocuparon cargos en la administración de aquellos territorios y cuya presencia demuestra la inquietud cultural de nuestra Patria en aquéllas Islas para la preparación de sus naturales y la colaboración de estos en las tareas de su Gobierno. Esta faceta en Filipinas aparece mucho más actuada que en el continente americano y de ahí que en Filipinas la Nobleza de cargo adquiera mayor importancia que en las Indias.DE CADENAS Y VICENT, Vicente (1993).

Other honors and high regard were also accorded to the Christianized Datus by the Spanish Empire. For example, the Gobernadorcillos (elected leader of the Cabezas de Barangay or the Christianized Datus) and Filipino officials of justice received the greatest consideration from the Spanish Crown officials. The colonial officials were under obligation to show them the honor corresponding to their respective duties. They were allowed to sit in the houses of the Spanish Provincial Governors, and in any other places. They were not left to remain standing. It was not permitted for Spanish Parish Priests to treat these Filipino nobles with less consideration.BLAIR, Emma Helen & ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903). The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898.

Current status questionis Heraldic Crown of Hispanic Hidalgos. A pre-colonial Tagalog couple belonging to the Datu class or nobility as depicted in the Boxer Codex of the 16th century. The recognition of the rights and privileges accorded to the Filipino Principalía as Hijosdalgos of Castile seems to facilitate entrance of Filipino nobles into institutions of under the Spanish Crown, either civil or religious, which required proofs of nobility. However, to see such recognition as an approximation or comparative estimation of rank or status might not be correct since in reality, although the principales were vassals of the Crown, their rights as sovereign in their former dominions were guaranteed by the Laws of the Indies, more particularly the Royal Decree of Philip II of 11 June 1594, which Charles II confirmed for the purpose stated above in order to satisfy the requirements of the existing laws in the Peninsula. It must be recalled that ever since the beginning of the colonialization, the conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi did not strip the ancient sovereign rulers of the Archipelago (who vowed allegiance to the Spanish Crown) of their legitimate rights. Many of them accepted the Catholic religion and were his allies from the very beginning. He only demanded from these local rulers vassalage to the Spanish Crown,FERRANDO, Fr Juan & FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870–1872). Historia de los PP. Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas y en las Misiones del Japon, China, Tung- kin y Formosa (Vol. 1 of 6 vols) (in Spanish). Madrid: Imprenta y esteriotipia de M Rivadeneyra, p. 146 replacing the similar overlordship, which previously existed in a few cases, e.g., Sultanate of Brunei's overlordship of the Kingdom of Maynila. Other independent polities which were not vassals to other States, e.g., Confederation of Madja-as and the Rajahnate of Cebu, were more of Protectorates/Suzerainties having had alliances with the Spanish Crown before the Kingdom took total control of most parts of the Archipelago. An interesting question remains after the cessession of the Spanish rule in the Philippines, that is, what is the equivalent of the rank of the Filipino Principalía, freed from vassalage yet not able to exercise their sovereignty within the democratic society in the Archipelago? One logical conclusion would be the reassumption of their ancestral Royal and noble title as Datus while retaining the Hidalguía of Castile (their former protector State), as a subsidiary title, appears most suitable to the hispanized Filipino nobles. Besides, as stated in the above-mentioned Royal Decree of Charles II, the ancient nobility of the Filipino Principales \\"is still retained and acknowledged\\". Just like the deposed royal families elsewhere in the world, which still lay claim to their hereditary rights as pretenders to the former thrones of their ancestors, the descendants of the Principalía have the same de iure claims to the historical domains of their forebears. Africa Africa has a plethora of ancient lineages in its various constituent nations. Some, such as the numerous sharifian families of North Africa, the Keita dynasty of Mali, the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia, the De Souza family of Benin and the Sherbro Tucker clan of Sierra Leone, claim descent from notables from outside of the continent. Most, such as those composed of the descendants of Shaka and Moshoeshoe of Southern Africa, belong to peoples that have been resident in the continent for millennia. Generally their royal or noble status is recognized by and derived from the authority of traditional custom. A number of them also enjoy either a constitutional or a statutory recognition of their high social positions. =Ethiopia= Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia (center) and members of the imperial court Ethiopia has a nobility that is almost as old as the country itself. Throughout the history of the Ethiopian Empire most of the titles of nobility have been tribal or military in nature. However the Ethiopian nobility resembled its European counterparts in some respects; until 1855, when Tewodros II ended the Zemene Mesafint its aristocracy was organised similarly to the feudal system in Europe during the Middle Ages. For more than seven centuries, Ethiopia (or Abyssinia, as it was then known) was made up of many small kingdoms, principalities, emirates and imamates, which owed their allegiance to the nəgusä nägäst (literally \\"King of Kings\\"). Despite its being a Christian monarchy, various Muslim states paid tribute to the emperors of Ethiopia for centuries: including the Adal Sultanate, the Emirate of Harar, and the Awsa sultanate. Ethiopian nobility were divided into two different categories: Mesafint (\\"prince\\"), the hereditary nobility that formed the upper echelon of the ruling class; and the Mekwanin (\\"governor\\") who were appointed nobles, often of humble birth, who formed the bulk of the nobility (cf. the Ministerialis of the Holy Roman Empire). In Ethiopia there were titles of nobility among the Mesafint borne by those at the apex of medieval Ethiopian society. The highest royal title (after that of emperor) was Negus (\\"king\\") which was held by hereditary governors of the provinces of Begemder, Shewa, Gojjam, and Wollo. The next highest seven titles were Ras, Dejazmach, Fit'awrari, Grazmach, Qenyazmach, Azmach and Balambaras. The title of Le'ul Ras was accorded to the heads of various noble families and cadet branches of the Solomonic dynasty, such as the princes of Gojjam, Tigray, and Selalle. The heirs of the Le'ul Rases were titled Le'ul Dejazmach, indicative of the higher status they enjoyed relative to Dejazmaches who were not of the blood imperial. There were various hereditary titles in Ethiopia: including that of Jantirar, reserved for males of the family of Empress Menen Asfaw who ruled over the mountain fortress of Ambassel in Wollo; Wagshum, a title created for the descendants of the deposed Zagwe dynasty; and Shum Agame, held by the descendants of Dejazmach Sabagadis, who ruled over the Agame district of Tigray. The vast majority of titles borne by nobles were not, however, hereditary. Despite being largely dominated by Christian elements, some Muslims obtained entrée into the Ethiopian nobility as part of their quest for aggrandizement during the 1800s. To do so they were generally obliged to abandon their faith and some are believed to have feigned conversion to Christianity for the sake of acceptance by the old Christian aristocratic families. One such family, the Wara Seh (more commonly called the \\"Yejju dynasty\\") converted to Christianity and eventually wielded power for over a century, ruling with the sanction of the Solomonic emperors. The last such Muslim noble to join the ranks of Ethiopian society was Mikael of Wollo who converted, was made Negus of Wollo, and later King of Zion, and even married into the Imperial family. He lived to see his son, Iyasu V, inherit the throne in 1913—only to be deposed in 1916 because of his conversion to Islam. =Madagascar= King Radama I of Madagascar was from the Andriana stratum of the Merina people. The nobility in Madagascar are known as the Andriana. In much of Madagascar, before French colonization of the island, the Malagasy people were organised into a rigid social caste system, within which the Andriana exercised both spiritual and political leadership. The word \\"Andriana\\" has been used to denote nobility in various ethnicities in Madagascar: including the Merina, the Betsileo, the Betsimisaraka, the Tsimihety, the Bezanozano, the Antambahoaka and the Antemoro. The word Andriana has often formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests that the origin of the title Andriana is traceable back to an ancient Javanese title of nobility. Before the colonization by France in the 1890s, the Andriana held various privileges, including land ownership, preferment for senior government posts, free labor from members of lower classes, the right to have their tombs constructed within town limits, etc. The Andriana rarely married outside their caste: a high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man took on her husband's lower rank, but a high-ranking man marrying a woman of lower rank did not forfeit his status, although his children could not inherit his rank or property (cf. morganatic marriage). In 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar endorsed the revival of a Christian Andriana monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition. =Nigeria= Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, on his throne in 2016 Contemporary Nigeria has a class of traditional notables which is led by its reigning monarchs, the Nigerian traditional rulers. Though their functions are largely ceremonial, the titles of the country's noblemen and women are often centuries old and are usually vested in the membership of historically prominent families in the various subnational kingdoms of the country. Membership of initiatory societies that have inalienable functions within the kingdoms is also a common feature of Nigerian nobility, particularly among the southern tribes, where such figures as the Ogboni of the Yoruba, the Nze na Ozo of the Igbo and the Ekpe of the Efik are some of the most famous examples. Although many of their traditional functions have become dormant due to the advent of modern governance, their members retain precedence of a traditional nature and are especially prominent during festivals. Outside of this, many of the traditional nobles of Nigeria continue to serve as privy counsellors and viceroys in the service of their traditional sovereigns in a symbolic continuation of the way that their titled ancestors and predecessors did during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Many of them are also members of the country's political elite due to their not being covered by the prohibition from involvement in politics that governs the activities of the traditional rulers. Holding a chieftaincy title, either of the traditional variety (which involves taking part in ritual re-enactments of your title's history during annual festivals, roughly akin to a British peerage) or the honorary variety (which does not involve the said re- enactments, roughly akin to a knighthood), grants an individual the right to use the word \\"chief\\" as a pre-nominal honorific while in Nigeria.  Latin America In addition to a variety of indigenous peoples (such as the Aymara and the Quechua, who have long traditions of being led by monarchs and nobles called Apu Mallkus and Mallkus), aristocratic connections exist among a number of other groups. Peerage traditions dating to the colonial period of such countries as Brazil, Cuba and Mexico have left noble families in each of them that have ancestral ties to those nations' native tribes, while such figures as the Afro-Bolivian king and the high priestess of the Ile Maroia Laji sect of Brazilian Candomblé trace their ancestries to and derive their prestige from ancient monarchs and nobles of the pre-colonial African continent. = Bolivia = Angélica Larrea, Queen Consort of the Afro-Bolivians, in 2012. The queen is the wife of King Julio Pinedo. In addition to the casta upperclass that dates to the era of Colonial Bolivia and that has ancestral ties to the Spanish nobility, the South American country also has a ceremonial monarchy that is recognized as part of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and that is led by a titular ruler that is known as the Afro-Bolivian king. The members of the royal house that he belongs to are the direct descendants of an old African tribal monarchy that were brought to Bolivia as slaves. They have provided leadership to the Afro-Bolivian community ever since that event and have been officially recognized by Bolivia's government since 2007. El retorno del rey negro boliviano a sus raíces africanas - El País = Brazil = Marquis of Paraná, Prime Minister of Brazil. The nobility in Brazil began during the colonial era with the Portuguese nobility. When Brazil became a united kingdom with Portugal in 1815, the first Brazilian titles of nobility were granted by the King of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. With the independence of Brazil in 1822 as a constitutional monarchy, the titles of nobility initiated by the King of Portugal were continued and new titles of nobility were created by the Emperor of Brazil. However, according to the Brazilian Constitution of 1824, the Emperor conferred titles of nobility, which were personal and therefore non-hereditary, unlike the earlier Portuguese and Portuguese-Brazilian titles, being inherited exclusively to the royal titles of the Brazilian Imperial Family. During the existence of the Empire of Brazil, 1,211 noble titles were acknowledged. With the proclamation of the First Brazilian Republic, in 1889, the Brazilian nobility was extinguished. It was also prohibited, under penalty of accusation of high treason and the suspension of political rights, to accept noble titles and foreign decorations without the proper permission of the State.

It is found in Ukraine, Spain, Sardinia, Italy, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Adults are on wing from late March to mid-May and again from July to September in Ukraine. The larvae feed on Convolvulus cantabrica. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow tortuous corridor with a central frass line, that often cuts off part of the leaf. Later, larvae leave the mine and begin to make a series of full depth fleck mines. Pupation takes place outside of the leaf.

He was a student of the mysterious alchemist known as Fulcanelli. He wrote the preface for each of his master's books (Le mystère des cathédrales and Les demeures philosophales). Later in his life after his master departed from this world, he took a quiet life in France and continued to study and practice what Fulcanelli taught him, even taking on students. Though Canseliet took on students and chose to pass on much of the alchemical knowledge imparted to him by the adept granted to the 20th century, Fulcanelli, Canseliet chose universities and less esoteric intellectual circles than his master, and simply passed on knowledge relating to the Opus Minor choosing to keep the discretion so customary of the great Hermetic Initiates, the “Unknown Brothers of the mysterious City of the Sun,” as Fulcanelli would have called them. Canseliet met with the late Frater Albertus, a German-American alchemist who practiced in Salt Lake City, Utah. According to Albertus, it was Canseliet who taught him the principle secret needed to perform the Magnum Opus. Canseliet believed by way of Fulcanelli’s teaching, that the only true method was the Dry Way, particularly the Star Regulus of Antimony, the path that Fulcanelli himself likely used. Some believe that Eugene Canseliet was actually Fulcanelli, but this is unlikely considering Canseliet’s exceedingly young age at the time of the publishing of Mystery of the Cathedrals and Dwellings of the Philosophers. This is further expounded by the vast historical, chemical, hermetic, and architectural knowledge possessed by the Initiate, Fulcanelli. Patrick Rivière wrote a book purportedly revealing the true identity of Fulcanelli to be a well to do Parisian physicist who was good friends with Pierre Curie. Canseliet supported this claim of acquaintance, saying that Fulcanelli had many well to do aristocratic colleagues and acquaintances.

This law was used from 1945 until 1991 and was part of the Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. The term was interchangeably used with counterrevolutionary agitation. The latter one was in use after the Albanian Resistance of World War II and was gradually phased out by the end of the 1990s in favor of the former one. According to article 55 of the Albanian Penal Code enacted during Hoxhaism, \\"propaganda and agitation that called to overturn or undermining of the Albanian power\\" was punishable with at least 6 months of imprisonment and up to the death sentence in the periods of war or unrest. Definition Article 55 was defined: :The creation of any type of organization of a fascist, anti-democratic, religious, and anti-socialist character is prohibited. :Fascist, anti-democratic, religious, war-mongering, and anti- socialist activities and propaganda, as well as the incitement of national and racial hatred are prohibited. Usage The article 55 was considered by the critics of the Albanian System as a grave violation of the freedom of speech. It was among the main legal instruments for the prosecution of the Albanian dissidents, some other being the punitive psychiatry and the offense of the social parasitism. While the clauses were phrased using the provision \\"with the purpose of\\", official commentaries (referred to as \\"Additions and Explanations to...\\"), as well as the actual legal practice made it sufficient to assert that the prosecuted person of sane mind must have realized the malicious implications of their utterances. This article was the most common tool in fighting Albanian dissidents. The first time the law was used was in 1951 at the bombing of Soviet Embassy. Trivia Gazeta 55 uses number \\"55\\" because Article 55 of the Constitution of communist Albania, dealt with Agitation and Propaganda related crimes.

Marketing strategy The idea of a secret brand works off of one or more of three economic principles. The first is scarcity value. The secret brand creates products with highly specific, unique qualities, usually very subtle and invisible to the casual observer. These qualities do not necessarily improve the performance of the product and can be inefficiencies (e.g., using heavy-weight denim for casual clothes). The customer purchases the product for its rarity; to have something that is very difficult to acquire. The second principle is branding. Large companies wanting to reach a new demographic may use a secret brand to establish clout among that demographic. This imprint brand may use the distribution network of the parent brand, but ship from a dummy company. Alternatively, the secret brand may employ individuals posing as independent agents to distribute goods to specialty stores. The theory behind these strategies is that it allows the parent company to expand its demographic without compromising the brand identity of its \\"open\\" brand. The third principle is experimentation. Openly announcing new products often affects stock values in publicly traded companies. If a company is unsure of the real world appeal of a product, it may employ a secret brand to experiment with market reaction on a small scale. This technique may be used after inconclusive focus group results (i.e. the majority somewhat dislike the product, while the minority is highly enthusiastic about it).

But while Yıldırım commends the director for, \\"taking his time in this tight script\\", he admits some reservations, \\"about the secondary characters\\", which despite being, \\"used as a tool to explore the depths of vulnerability and human connection in the shadow of destitution\\", \\"are questionable\\", and, \\"not wholly convincing\\". Yıldırım concludes, \\"the main story is the full-on driving force of this drama supported with intense performances by the lead actors (Kıraç proves once again what a diverse and compassionate actor he is) and a cinematic language that supports the genuineness of the characters’ motivation and behavior.\\" \\"Demirdelen, who comes from a background in advertising, knows how to tell a story and how to tell it to maximum effect\\", states Yıldırım thanks the director, \\"for reminding us that emotional complexity can be shown through action and reaction, rather than through cerebral thawing\\", and commends that \\"he doesn't allow his characters to wallow in self pity and stare into the void more than they need to\\". \\"Instead of revealing a big twist at the end\\", which according to Güler, \\"is very much predicted from the beginning of the movie\\", Demirdelen, \\"seems to be more interested in how the obvious mystery will unravel throughout the movie, and how it will have an impact on Güven's life and his psyche. So when Güven tells of what happened in a teary monologue toward the end, the scene seems long and at best unnecessary, damaging the slowly built character development.\\" \\"Here's hoping that it doesn’t take that long for Demirdelen to begin shooting his next feature\\", Güler concludes, noting that, \\"There has been quite some time since his segment in 2005's Anlat Istanbul (Istanbul Tales).\\" = Awards = * 17th International Adana Golden Boll Film Festival ** Best Director: Selim Demirdelen (shared with Levent Semerci for \\"Breath\\") ** Best Actress: Sezin Akbaşoğulları (shared with Nergis Öztürk for \\"Envy\\") ** Most Promising Newcomer (actor): Umut Kurt (won) ** Best Music: Selim Demirden  See also  * 2010 in film * Turkish films of 2010 References External links  2010 films Turkish films 2010 drama films Films set in Turkey Turkish drama films ","title":"The Crossing (2010 film)"},{"id":"28978771","text":"Kawya is a village on the Chindwin River in Homalin Township, Hkamti District, in the Sagaing Region of northwestern Burma.

It covers the northern area of the county bordering the south-eastern shoreline of Lough Neagh. At some stage the barony was divided into Oneilland East and Oneilland West. Territory The barony of Oneilland—also recorded as Oneilan—derives its name from the anglicisation of the ancient Irish district of Uí Nialláin, which was named after the Irish sept of the same name. Its territory however is based upon three such districts: \\"Oneilan, Clanbrassil, and Clancann\\". Clanbrassil and Clancann both lay along the southern shoreline of Lough Neagh, with the River Bann forming the boundary between them, with the former on the east side and the latter on the west side. Oneilan lay south of Clancann also west of the river. Medieval history The Uí Nialláin were a sept of Clan Cernaich, and they ruled from Loch gCál, modern-day Loughgall. Along with the Uí Bresail and Uí Echdach, they were amongst the main dynasties to arise from the split in the 8th century of Airthir, one of the nine kingdoms of Airgíalla. The land of the Uí Echdach corresponded to the modern barony of Armagh. The land of the Uí Bresail, recorded as \\"Clanbrassil\\" in English, as well as that of \\"Clancann\\" both lay in the modern barony of Oneilland East along the southern shore of Lough Neagh. The River Bann The related Ó hAnluain (O'Hanlon) sept were for a couple of centuries chiefs of Oneilland, after which they ruled for several centuries as chiefs of a much reduced Airthir, which by then corresponded to the modern baronies of Orior Lower and Orior Upper, which derive their name from it. The Ó Gairbhith (O'Garvey) sept, who were kindred with the Ó hAnluain, held sway in Clanbrassil before the Mac Cana (McCann) sept of Clan Cana (Clancann) took over. The Mac Cana would extend Clanbrassil to encompass all of Oneilland and what is now the barony of Dungannon Middle in County Tyrone. Clanbrassil was also recorded as \\"McCan's Country\\". The McCanns last residence in suggested as being in an area of land recorded in the plantation map near the shore of Lough Neagh called \\"Maghery-Greny\\". By the 16th century the O'Neills of Tir Eoghain had taken over what was to become the barony of Oneilland. Due to the areas attractiveness it became a favourite retreat for members of the O'Neill family in times of peace and war. As The O'Neill resided at the clan's capital in Dungannon, Oneilland was set apart for his brother or eldest son, who resided in a crannog in Loughgall, which then was a more extensive lough. The O'Neill reserved for himself the right to temporarily stay at this residence. Thus Oneilland became the territory of Art MacBaron O'Neill, son of Matthew O'Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon, with the area in a map from 1560 called \\"Art Mac Baron his countree\\". Art's younger half- brother, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who eventually became head of the family thus having Dungannon as his residence seemed to favour residing in Loughgall. Plantation of Ulster Map of part of the barony of Oneilland in County Armagh as drawn by Josias Bodley during the survey of Ulster in 1609. Detailed are the proportions and townlands within the district of Oneilland portion of the barony. (map not to scale or accurate location) The boundaries of the Plantation of Ulster precinct of Oneilland were conterminous with the barony. As part of the plantation, it was set aside for English undertakers only and due to the high fertility of the land and its closeness to The Pale it was the most sought after area. The most notable native to be displaced by the English undertakers was Art MacBaron O'Neill. It was considered desirable by the government at the time to handle Art's removal carefully so that it would happen peacefully and thus inspire his kinsmen in Oneilland to react in kind. The council for the plantation in London decided that it would decide where to dislodge Art to, in which they granted him 2,000 acres in the neigbhbouring barony of Orior. Due to his advanced years Art gave little resistance and upon his peaceful acceptance of his proportion in Orior, saw many of his kinsmen in Oneilland do likewise. For the purposes of plantation grants, Oneilland was divided into thirteen proportions granted to ten individuals: eight consisting of 1,000 acres; three consisting of 1,500 acres; and two consisting of 2,000 acres. Due to the gratuity of the planners so called waste or unprofitable land were thrown in meaning the undertakers may have ended up with far more land than they were intended to be given. In some cases this \\"unprofitable\\" land turned out to at times be more profitable than the arable land. The English undertakers given the initial grants where: *Richard Rolleston, a clergyman from Staffordshire, who received the small proportion of Teemore. He however lost his land to his own fellow countryman, Francis Annesley. *Francis Sacherville from Leicestershire who received two small proportions: Mullalelish and Legagacorry. *John Brownlowe from Nottingham received the middle proportion of Doughcorron, which corresponded to the northern part of the ancient district of Clanbrassil. He named his residence Brownlowe-Derry, after the townland of Derry that it was built in. *James Matchett, a clergyman from Trimingham, Norfolk, who received the small proportion of Kerhanan. He was unable to fulfill the conditions of his grant so he gave it to Lord Viscount Grandison and his heirs, and became rector of Kilmore. Matchett would be killed in the first outbreak of violence in the Irish rebellion of 1641. Kerhanan corresponded nearly to the center of Clanbrassil. *William Powell of Castlespark, Staffordshire, received the great proportion of Ballyworran. An enquiry of the king's stable, he may have received his grant as payment for arrears in salary, and with no intention of leaving his post, Powell sold his grant as soon as he had received it. Ballyworran spanned the southern extremities of Clanbrassil and Clancann. *John Dillon of Aggardsley Park, Staffordshire, the middle proportion of Mullabane. Dillon was one of the most enthusiastic undertakers in the planatation. His residence was named Castle Dillon. *William Brownlowe, the son of John Brownlowe, who received the small proportion of Ballynemony, which lay on the southern shore of Lough Neagh. Upon his father's death, he inherited his grant of Doughcorron. *William Stanhowe of Norwich, Norfolk, who received the middle proportion of Kannagolah. Kannagolah spanned nearly the whole length of the ancient Irish district of Clancann from north to south, and included the possible last residence of the districts McCann chiefs. *John Heron who received the small proportions of Aghivillan and Broughes, which both formed one manor. Aghivillan lay in Clancann, whilst the majority of Broughes also lies in Clancann, with the rest in Oneilland. *Sir Anthony Cope of Cope Castle, Kensington, London, who received the great proportion of Dirrichrreny and the small proportion of Dromully, both of which were made one manor. Originally Lord Saye was to take out the patent however Cope bought out his interest. Dirrichrreny and Dromully both lay in the district of Oneilland. His manor contained the town of Loughgall. In 1611 a report commissioned by the king to inspect the plantations in Ulster was carried out by Sir George Garew, in which Oneilland's progress was the most favourable. Despite this woodkerns—displaced natives—for three years launched raids on the plantation spreading fear and terror. Woodkerns are recorded as attacking from the dense forests of Clancann, Clanbrassil, and Oneilland, and other districts in County Armagh. 1608 rebellion In 1608 Eochaidh Óg O'Hanlon, son and heir of Sir Eochaidh O'Hanlon, along with the son of the recently executed son of Brian Mac Art O'Neill of Loughgall, rose up in support of Sir Cahir O'Doherty of Inishowen, County Donegal, who had risen in rebellion against the English. Both Eochaidh Óg and O'Neill felt obliged to support O'Doherty due to family ties, with Eochaidh Og married to Cahir's sister Margaret. Their main opponent was their kinsman Sir Turlough MacHenry O'Neill of the barony of the Fews who captured the two men. The Lord Deputy of Ireland Chichester tried to blame the forests and Eochaidh Og O'Hanlon's rebellion in 1608 for the woodkern, however it was his own policies that was the problem. Division of Oneilland When the barony of Oneilland was split into two, the portion east of the River Bann corrsponding to the ancient district of Clanbrassil became Oneilland East, whilst the portion west of the river corresponding to the districts of Oneilland and Clancann became Oneilland West. Oneilland East consisted of 34,408 statute acres, whilst Oneilland West consisted of 59,502.

The English ships were sent from Boston to interrupt the supplies being taken by French officer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville from Quebec to the capital of Acadia, Fort Nashwaak (Fredericton, New Brunswick) on the Saint John River. The French ships of war Envieux and Profond captured the English frigate Newport ( 24 guns), while the English frigate Sorlings (34 guns) and a provincial tender escaped. Background In 1696, King William's war was in its seventh year. D'Iberville was about to be engaged in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696), the New England stronghold in present-day Maine. D'Iberville sailed from Rochefort, Charente-Maritime to Quebec City, where he took on board eighty troops and Canadians; then proceeded to Havre à l'Anglois (future site of Louisbourg), Cape Breton and embarked thirty Mi'kmaq, and departed for the St. John River.Parkman While at nearby Baie des Espagnols, D'Iberville heard two English vessels were in the Bay of Fundy and decided to attempt to capture them.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979. p. 165. On July 5, 140 natives (Mi'kmaq and Maliseet), with Jacques Testard de Montigny and Chevalier, from their location of Manawoganish island, ambushed the crews of four English vessels. Some of the English were coming ashore in a long boat to get firewood. A native killed five of the nine men in the boat. The Mi'kmaq burned the vessel under the direction of Father Florentine (missionary to the Micmacs at Chignectou). Battle Jacques Testard de Montigny (1663-1737) On the 14 July, five leagues from St. John River, D'Iberville cast anchor in the fog. At 2:00 the fog began to clear and the French ships could see the three English vessels to windward, bearing directly for the river St. John. When they were one league off, the English observed the French vessels, and bore down on them. Commander Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure, captain of the French ship Profond masked her warlike character, keeping her ports closed until within musket shot. Both English vessels open fired on the French ships. Bonaventure opened the ports on the Profond and the English ships kept windward, (ticnnent le vent), and realizing they were outgunned, endeavoured to escape. The Profond tried to gain the wind on them, and D'Iberville in the Envieux followed, contending with stormy weather. D'Iberville, in the Envieux, fired upon the English frigate Newport, under the command of Captain Paxen, dismasting her. The prize falling astern, came almost aboard the bow of the Envieux, and lowered her flag. M. D'Iberville left her to be manned by M. de Bonaventure, who gave her to Baptiste to take her to the river St. John, at which place he almost lost her among the rocks where she run aground. D'Iberville in the Envieux continued to chase the larger ship the Sorlings, under the command of Captain Eames. The shot of the French ship passed beyond the chase, but night and fog closed their combat, which had lasted three hours, and the English ship escaped. Aftermath On July 15, 1696, the day after the battle, D'Iberville entered Saint John Harbour. After discharging stores for capital of Acadia at Fort Nashwaak, D'Iberville took on board 50 more Mi'kmaq and Pere Simon on August 2, 1696, set sail for Penobscot (present-day Castine, Maine). While at St. John he repaired the Newport and added the ship to his fleet.The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, 1602 ..., Volume 1 By William Durkee Williamson, p. 643 At Penobscot, where they arrived August 7, they found Villieu and Montigny with 25 Canadians, Thury [Father], St. Castin [Sr.] and three hundred Indians waiting for them. On 14 August, D'Iberville led them all in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696).(Hannay) The Sorlings upon its escape sailed for Boston. On reaching Boston the Sorlings found two English warships and an armed merchant vessel. The four ships then sailed east to provide assistance to an expected attack by the French on Portsmouth. The English vessels spotted the Envieux and Profond near Mount Desert but the French were able to make an escape.
