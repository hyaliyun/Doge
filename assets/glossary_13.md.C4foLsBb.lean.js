It was published in the late 1700s; James Lyon (1776-1824) was the nominal owner and publisher, but the de facto owner and author of much of its content was Lyon's father Matthew Lyon. History In the early years of Vermont statehood, there were two newspapers in circulation: the Bennington Gazette and the Windsor Journal. Matthew Lyon was an early political, military, and business leader of Vermont. He founded the town of Fair Haven in 1783, and constructed and operated several businesses, including mills and forges. Having been trained as a printer and bookbinder, in 1793 Lyon decided to create a newspaper as way to communicate his ideas to the voters; he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1791 and 1792, and intended to run again in 1794. Lyon established a newspaper in Fair Haven; though his son James, also a printer and publisher, was the nominal owner, much of the paper's management was overseen by Matthew Lyon, and he authored much of the content. In addition to Matthew Lyon's articles, other stories and columns were prepared by James Lyon and Alden Spooner (1757-1827). In 1794, James and Matthew Lyon sold the physical plant for the Fair Haven Gazette to Reverend Samuel Williams and Judge Samuel Williams of Rutland; they used these items to establish the Rutland Herald, a newspaper which has remained in circulation ever since. Legacy Matthew Lyon failed to win a U.S. House seat in 1794; he was finally elected on his fourth attempt in 1796. As a way to continue communicating his Democratic-Republican ideas to his constituents and oppose the ideas of the Federalists, Matthew Lyon and James Lyon started a new paper, The Scourge Of Aristocracy and Repository of Important Political Truth. In 1798, Matthew Lyon was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, based on anti-Adams administration comments he had made in the Scourge, and a letter to Alden Spooner; Spooner was now publisher of the Vermont Journal, and the letter appeared in his paper. Lyon was held in prison in Vergennes, Vermont; he won reelection to Congress in 1798 while he was incarcerated. Lyon's prison term expired on February 9, 1799; he could not pay the fine which was part of his sentence, or the costs associated with his imprisonment. Political supporters raised the necessary funds, enabling him to be released and take up his seat in the House. After failing to win reelection in 1800, Lyon moved to Kentucky, where he was involved in several business ventures and was again elected to Congress.

Her repertoire included music from Baroque to contemporary premieres. Career Born in Kingston, New York in a German- American family on August 13, 1930, Bence began her voice studies in the United States. She toured with the Robert Shaw Chorale from 1950 to 1953, when she continued her studies in Stuttgart. Her teachers included Res Fischer and Ellinor Junker-Giesen. She appeared first in concert, especially in alto-parts of oratorios. In 1956 she joined the ensemble of the Württembergische Staatsoper, where she remained for 14 years. She studied a broad repertory, from Baroque to contemporary music, playing as both comic and tragic characters. She appeared as a guest artist, first in 1959 when the Stuttgart Opera performed Wagner's Parsifal at the Vienna State Opera. She was engaged there for Handel's Jephtha, with Fritz Wunderlich, and for Janáček's Jenůfa. In 1961, she appeared at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo as Annina in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, which became one of her signature roles. From 1962 she was invited to international festivals. She performed at the Bayreuth Festival, in 1962 as Rossweisse and Waltraute in Der Ring des Nibelungen, the next year also Erda in Das Rheingold and Siegfried, and a small part in Parsifal. In 1965 she performed Rossweisse once more. She sang at the Bavarian State Opera first in 1963, the role of Babekan in the premiere of Werner Egk's Die Verlobung in San Domingo. In 1966, she appeared at the Schwetzingen Festival in the premiere of Hermann Reutter's Der Tod des Empedokles, and she made her debut at the Salzburg Festival as Marcellina in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. The new production was staged by Günther Rennert and conducted by Karl Böhm, with Claire Watson and Ingvar Wixell as the noble couple, Reri Grist and Walter Berry as Susanna and Figaro, and Edith Mathis as Cherubino.

Built about 1899, it provided power to the surrounding estate of the Scoville family, owners of local iron mining and processing operations. It was converted into a privated residence in the 1950s, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its distinctive architecture. Description and history The former Scoville Powerhouse is located in a rural-residential cluster in northeastern Salisbury, at the northwest corner of Twin Lakes Road and Beaver Dam Road. It is set on the south bank of Schenob Brook, near the outlet of the Twin Lakes. It is 1-1/2 stories in height, built out of stone, brick, and concrete and covered by a steeply pitched hip roof. The front facade faces east toward Taconic Road, and is dominated by two steep gables, each rising above now-glassed openings that resemble the openings for carriages in carriage houses. The gable edges are decorated with Gothic style bargeboard. The building has rustic stone corner quoins. The water that powered the building's turbine (still in situ but now bypassed and not operation) was provided via a penstock that runs under Taconic Road just south of the dam (which the road crosses over). and This site on Schenob Brook was first used for power generation in the 18th century, powering a forge and gristmill c. 1748. Land in this area was acquired by Herbert and Robert Scoville in 1899. The Scovilles were by then important political and business leaders in the community, owning one of the local iron works. The developed this area as a country estate, building a large stone country manor (destroyed by fire), a carriage house (across Schenob Brook, also converted to a residence), and the powerhouse, which provided electricity to the estate. Family records are unclear on how long the power station operated, but the estate was sold off in portions in the mid-20th century. The power station was sold in the 1950s and converted into a residence.

Born in Islington, Challener's parents died when he was young, and he was brought up by a relative who worked for the Great Northern Railway. In time, he moved with his relative to Doncaster, and there began working for the railway company as a clerk. He was an early member of the National Association of Railway Clerks (RCA), being a founder member of its Doncaster branch, later in 1897.Adrian Tranter, \\"Challener, John Ernest Stopford\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.55-57 Challener devoted much of his time to the union, attending each of its conferences, and in May 1899 taking the lead on a national campaign to increase clerks' salaries. The union's general secretary, John Hereford, resigned late in 1898 due to poor health, and Challener was the only candidate to replace him, being declared elected at the union's conference in June 1899. From 1900, he also served as the union's treasurer, and from 1902 he became the union's first full-time member of staff. As leader, Challener decided to bring the RCA into the mainstream British trade union movement; he registered it as a trade union in 1900, and arranged for it to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress in 1903. As a result, he was able to increase membership from 537, to 4,500, by 1906. Challener was also politically active. He was the founding secretary of the Doncaster Labour Representation Committee (LRC), although he decided against advocating that the RCA affiliate to the national LRC. He stood for Doncaster Council in 1903 and 1904, although he was not elected, and he was also prominent on Doncaster Trades Council. By 1905, issues with the RCA's finances had emerged. The union's 1905 conference supported a motion criticising Challener for financial mismanagement, although it also supported a motion of confidence in his overall leadership. However, further investigation revealed that the financial issues were due to theft rather than incompetence - he was ultimately revealed to have stolen £380. His mental health declined, and he travelled to Paris in 1906, where he shot himself.

She is known for her geological work assisting husband Edward Greenly in his surveying of Scotland and Anglesey, as well as being an accomplished artist and animal rights' representative. She died of heart failure on 1 March 1927, at the age of 75. The \\"Annie Greenly Fund\\" for detailed geological mapping was established in her honour by the Geological Society of London. Personal life Much of what we know about Annie Greenly comes from the autobiographic work of her husband. Greenly grew up in Bath and Bristol in a liberal evangelical household. Her first introduction to geology came at age 11 when she witnessed an earthquake on 6 October 1863. She first met her future husband Edward Greenly in 1875 in Bristol. Their families were acquainted and encouraged the growing friendship between the two, which was built on philosophical and poetic exchanges as well as Edward's scientific studies. Greenly often helped the then chemistry student with experiments in his home laboratory. When pressed by Edward's parents to either become engaged or break off the relationship, they separated and lost all contact for 11 years. Edward approached her again in 1890, and they soon got engaged and married in 26 September 1891. The couple had no children. Greenly was blind in one eye from an early age. Due to worries for his wife's health Edward Greenly retired from the Geological Survey in 1895, and the couple subsequently moved to Anglesey where they continued their geological surveying and mapping relying on a private income. Despite her obvious interest in geology she stressed herself: \\"I am not a scholar\\". On top of her scientific role, Annie Greenly was a contralto singer and pianist, and a long-standing member of her local branch of the North Wales RSPCA. Edward Greenly (and with him Annie to a lesser extent) was a mystic who shifted from Evangelicalism to pantheistic religion and Buddhism. He strongly believed to be reunited with his wife, who he survived by almost a quarter of a century, in an afterlife. Geological career Greenly became fully involved in her husband's geological work immediately after their wedding. \\"We have agreed that I am not to be ignorant of your subject… I can begin by reading. Put into our luggage some lucid elementary books.\\" Subsequently, She worked as Edward's field assistant who was working for the Scottish Geological Survey before retiring to Anglesey. She took control of logistics, arranging lodgings and facilities, prepared powdered mineral specimens, and extensively proof-read and edited his writing. Edward reflects on her value as assistant in one aspect in particular: \\"More than one geologist […] has been killed while examining railway cuttings. When the author was examining cuttings in Anglesey, Annie Greenly always came with him as train-watcher and with her at the top of the bank he was able to concentrate on the geology.\\" More than providing logistical and moral support, however, Greenly revolutionised her husband's surveying technique early on. She encouraged him to follow the exemplary lead of his colleague Charles Clough’s in all but one respect:, stating, \\"Let Clough be your model in precision, but do not follow him in style. Found your style on nature’s curves. Watch these wherever you can and where you cannot see them, feel them. To be true, a map must be beautiful.\\" Edward claimed that his wife was \\"the initial source of [his] inspiration\\". Thus her sense of clarity and beauty was critical in developing her husband's style of mapping, including the green line method for which Edward Greenly is famous until today. A thin green line is placed on the map around all rock exposure highlighting the data that the geological interpretation of the map is based on. In particular, Annie was instrumental for Greenly's map of Anglesey. She takes particular credit for the index to the Anglesey memoir which is now held in the National Museum of Wales. Edward Greenly documents her continuous support: \\"some sheets she pronounced to be hopeless and these […] she rewrote altogether…we worked on opposite sides of the table, I writing, she doctoring.\\" She was highly valued for her persistence and logic. Greenly was meticulous in the reading and editing of her husband's manuscripts, finishing a final piece of work only a week before her death. Together with her husband, Greenly regularly attended the annual meetings of the Geological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and other conferences and meetings. In 1903, she instigated the first ever female participation in the conference dinner, which extended to other female geologists such as Gertrude Elles and Lady Teall.

Life Boissevain was the youngest of nine children. Her father was a shipowner from a rich Huguenot merchant family and her mother was the daughter of a lawyer. Education Boissevain attended a high school for girls. After graduating, Boissevain attended a lecture on botany by Hugo de Vries, which sparked her interest in the subject. In 1896, she started studying natural science at the University of Amsterdam. Here she specialised in zoology. After graduating, she moved to Zurich to do further research on the Dentalium species and at age 25 attained the title of doctor. Afterwards, she moved back to the Netherlands where she became a curator for Artis, a Dutch zoo and association for zoology. She would remain active as a researcher until 1915, but would retain her interest in zoology afterwards. Four mollusk taxa are named after her: the species Cadulus boissevaini, Antalis boissevainae, Fustiaria Mariae and the genus Boissevainia. Women's rights While in Zurich, Boissevain encountered international students who were interested in women's rights. When she returned to the Netherlands, she visited Aletta Jacobs to talk about the Dutch women's rights movement.Boissevain in 1001 Vrouwen In 1908, Jacobs asked Boissevain to help with the preparation for the third International Congress of Women in Amsterdam. Here, she met other prominent feminists and would go on to become more involved in the women's movement. Together with Rosa Manus, who she had gone to school with, she founded a commission for propaganda within the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht and was its president until 1912. The same year, she and Manus proposed an exhibition that would highlight the circumstances of women between 1813 and 1913, inspired by the exhibitions held to celebrate 100 years of independence from the French. She wrote the catalog for the exhibition De Vrouw 1813-1913, which became successful.Catalog on worldcat During the First World War, Boissevain helped the families of mobilised soldiers and Flemish refugees. In 1915, she was one of the organisers of the International Congress of Women in the Hague. In the same year, she also wrote a book about her life titled Een Amsterdamsche familie, which was published in 1967. After 1915, Boissevain moved to Great Britain and adopted two English girls. She lived in Switzerland with her two daughters from around 1925 to 1928, moved to the Netherlands afterwards and lived in London from 1930 until her death in 1959. She is buried in Amsterdam.

Retrieved 9 March 2017 Life Chambers received her DPhil in political theory from the University of Oxford, and she subsequently taught at the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics, before moving to the University of Cambridge. She has published on feminism, liberalism, and social construction. Philosophical work In her 2008 book Sex, Culture, and Justice: the Limits of Free Choice, Chambers is concerned about what the state's response should be to cultural practices which individuals freely choose to partake in as a way of securing certain goods, when those practices impose disproportionate costs on vulnerable members of the community. She defends three main claims. First, individual preferences to pursue certain activities are shaped by social construction: if individuals are raised to follow certain practices which are deemed choiceworthy in their community, then they will be more disposed to follow these practices later in life. Second, if social construction brings individuals to form preferences for activities that are self-degrading or self-harmful, the individuals in question are victims of an unjust process of social construction. Third, the state is permitted to prohibit self-degrading or self-harmful activities that individuals freely choose to follow when their preference for following these activities was shaped by an unjust process of social construction; this is because preferences formed by an unjust process of social construction are morally suspect, and the state has a greater obligation to free individuals from pernicious practices that harm and degrade them than to satisfy morally suspect preferences. According to Marion Smiley, Chambers' use of the notion of an unjust process social construction \\"to justify, as well as to limit, prohibition, provides us with a whole new and productive way of using the state to promote gender equality,\\" and she argues that a particular virtue of Chambers' work is that it \\"makes clear why we do not have to choose between gender equality and autonomy in our efforts to prevent harm in the lives of women and all others.\\" In her 2017 book Against Marriage: An Egalitarian Defense of the Marriage-Free State she argues that marriage violates both equality and liberty so should not be recognised by the state, nor have any legal status. This built on her earlier paper 'The marriage-free state' which makes the case for abolishing state-recognized marriage and replacing it with piecemeal regulation of personal relationships.

Wellings' dolls are often made of cloth (felt, velvet and velveteen), and represent children and adults, as well as storybook characters. The manufacturing process involved moulding buckram over a layer of plastic wood, overlaid with steamed felt. The faces were then handpainted on, with a waterproof coating to make them washable. Wellings exhibited at the British Industries Fairs in 1927 and 1929. She was listed as a 'Manufacturer of Soft Fabric Toys of Distinction' and the range included dolls, plush novelties, and mascots. During World War Two, Wellings made dolls representing characters from the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, including Harry the Hawk, which was sold to raise money for the Royal Air Force Comforts Fund. She also made a number of 'Jolly Boy' felt sailor figures, which were sold as souvenirs aboard cruise liners. In 1959, some months after the death of her brother, Leonard, Wellings closed the business, destroyed her designs, tools and unfinished dolls, and retired.

It was designed to meet needs in professional employees for oil refineries, in Drohobych, Boryslav and other parts of Drohobych district. The World War II interrupted the educational process in college. It was restored later in 1944 when institution changed name to Drohobych Electro-Mechanical College. The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948. In 1949 the college opened courses in metalworking and processing. Later, in 1952, it also run programmes to prepare engineers in wood and furniture manufacturing industries. In 1956 the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine transferred college to Economic department of Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality, and in 1967 college became special industrial educational institution under jurisdiction of the Ukrainian SSR Ministry of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering. =Post-Declaration= As of 28 November 1991 more than 10,000 professionals im engineering industry graduated from the college.

He has substantially shaped the Swiss financial services sector and the international hedge fund industry.  Career  Rainer-Marc Frey was born on January 10, 1963 in the Swiss canton of Basel-Landschaft. Following his Matura graduation in economics at the Gymnasium of Liestal, he studied economics at the renowned University of St. Gallen. He graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics (lic. oec. HSG) in 1986. After his studies, he gained his first professional experiences at the American investment banks Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers and quickly rose in the ranks. At Salomon Brothers, he initiated the opening of new trading departments in Zürich and Frankfurt. Despite excellent career prospects, he left the firm in 1992 and founded his own hedge fund – the RMF Investment Group - along with two partners in Zug. = RMF Investment Group = The investment thesis of hedge funds, i.e. achieving above average returns compared to the reference market and reducing risk through hedging strategies, was widely unknown in Switzerland at the time and was met by scepticism among investors. RMF achieved ground-breaking results. At the beginning, banks and insurance companies in Switzerland did not see the potential in this type of fund, which aimed to also make gains in sideways or negative trending markets. As such, RMF started trading on Japanese warrants and convertible bonds. It was one of the first active hedge fund groups in Europe. RMF’s investment thesis proved successful, despite difficult periods such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Following these dry spell periods, institutional investors started accepting these concepts. A successful collaboration with LGT Group and Swiss Life (then Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs- und Rentenanstalt) started in 1996 with the launch of Castle Alternative Invest, a hedge fund investment company.

A bronze cast of her 1903 bust of the writer Herman Bang was installed on Sankt Annæ Plads in Copenhagen in 2012. Early life Born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 18 June 1872, Plockross Irminger was the daughter of the merchant Johannes Frederik Plockross (1821–96) and Cathrine Frederikke Tietgen (1833–91). After showing interest in modelling from an early age, she began her studies under the sculptor Aksel Hansen before attending the art school run by Emilie Mundt and Marie Luplau. In February 1893 Plockross Irminger was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where she studied sculpture under August Saabye until 1899 when she worked for a number of years in Vilhelm Bissen's studio. In 1908, she married the painter Valdemar Irminger. Career as a sculptor Irminger first exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1897 with En Spæd, a bronze relief. She continued to exhibit there until 1952, especially from 1904 to 1925. She also occasionally exhibited at the Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund (Female Artists' Society) from 1920 to 1961. Her work was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, at the 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malmö and at the 1927 Danish National Exhibition in Brooklyn. Thanks to grants from the Academy, she went on study trips to Paris, Germany and Italy. Under Bissen's guidance, Irminger developed her own style bordering on Naturalism. Among her principal creations are Drengen og Pinfsvinet (The Boy and the Hedgehog, 1899 and bronze 1911), Yngling (Youth, marble, 1909), awarded the Academy's medal of the year, and Ung Pige (marble, 1907) which is reminiscent of Ludvig Brandstrup. She also created portraits of J.F. Willumsen (relief, 1900), Herman Bang (bronze, 1904) and Ludvig Brandstrup (1922). She also created two fine bronzes of her husband in 1912 and 1919, characterized by a still, rather introvert look. Also of interest are the decorative funeral urns and the figurines she designed while at Bing & Grøndahl's from 1898 to 1925. Of special note are her Moder og Barn (Mother and Child, 1902), Læsende Børn (Children Reading, 1903), and Ung Pige med Kat (Young Girl with Cat, 1911). The figures became very popular. Many were acquired by museums in Berlin and Dresden. They are still produced today, faithfully reproduced from Irminger's original designs.

Born in Derby, Peet became a fitter in the railway works, and joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). He soon moved to Manchester, where he worked at the Gorton Railway Works, and for the first time became active in the union, winning election as branch secretary.Edmund Frow, Ruth Frow and John Saville, \\"Peet, George\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.170-173 Peet became a socialist, joining the Openshaw Socialist Society, and developed an interest in syndicalism, representing Gorton at a national conference on the matter in 1910. Around the start of World War I, he joined the British Socialist Party (BSP), alongside Harry Pollitt. Increasingly prominent in his trade union work, in 1916 he came eighth out of twenty-two candidates for the assistant general secretaryship of the ASE. Inspired by the Clyde Workers' Committee, Peet worked with William McLaine to form the Manchester Workers' Committee, in April 1916. Initially, it attracted little interest, but in September a decision to increase the wages of hourly paid engineering workers but not those of piece workers led to a strike, which the committee supported. Although the strike was soon over, the dispute was not settled for a further three months, and the strike committee then agreed to merge with the Workers' Committee, forming the Joint Engineering Shop Stewards' Committee, with Peet as secretary. The Shop Stewards' Committee played a prominent role in subsequent disputes around exemptions of trained engineers from military service and compelling engineers to work on non-munition work. While the ASE supported local action on these issues, the Committee organised a ballot on solidarity action. This was won, and led to a major two-week strike which spread around the country, ultimately involving 200,000 engineering workers. Peet travelled the country supporting the strike, until he and Arthur MacManus were arrested in London. They and their colleagues then agreed to sign an agreement between the ASE and the Ministry of Munitions which settled the strike and, as a result, Peet and MacManus were released. In August 1917, Peet was an organiser of a national conference of shop stewards' organisations. This formed the permanent Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committees, of which Peet served as secretary, alongside MacManus as chair, and J. T. Murphy as assistant secretary. Two months later, it merged with a movement for the amalgamation of engineering unions, which had been founded in 1915 but had achieved little during the war. The organisation supported the October Revolution, and Peet became its representative to the Hands Off Russia movement. It hoped to affiliate to the Third International; this was not permitted, as it was not a political party, but it joined the Red International of Labour Unions, Peet and Ted Lismer becoming joint secretaries of its British Bureau. The Shop Stewards' Committee became part of the National Workers' Committee in 1921, and Peet was prominent in its calls for a general strike on Black Friday. This was unsuccessful, and Peet was arrested, jailed for a month, and fined £100. The National Workers' Committee in turn merged with the British Bureau in 1922, Peet remaining joint secretary for a year, after which the Comintern ordered that Willie Gallacher and J. R. Campbell replace him and Lismer. In 1920, the BSP became part of the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and Peet served on its Manchester District Committee. However, his replacement as secretary of the British Bureau appears to have shaken his support for the party; he resigned from the CPGB some time after 1923, and did not undertake any further political activity. Peet remained active in the ASE, and was one of its delegates to the Trades Union Congress in 1918. He also served as a tutor for the Manchester Labour College. The ASE became the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and Peet devoted himself to the branch, and was still branch treasurer when he died, in 1967.

His uncanny genius at setting up artillery parks gave Frederick the Great high confidence in the artillery's ability to effect the outcome. During the Seven Years' War, Moller gained great fame specifically for his actions at Lobositz, Rossbach and Zorndorf. Military service Moller, born in 1690, joined the Prussian military on 26 January 1720 as a cannoneer in the artillery corps, of which his father was the regimental quartermaster. On 1 April 1729, he was promoted to second lieutenant and on 31 August 1733, to first lieutenant. In 1737, he was dispatched to the Austrian army, to fight in the war against the Ottoman Empire. On 19 November 1741 he returned to the Prussian army, and was promoted to staff captain; in January 1742, he was promoted to captain and on 20 April 1755 to major.Bernhard von Poten, Moller, Karl Friedrich von, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, edited by the Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Historical Commission at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences], Volume 22 (1885), pp. 127–128, digital full text available at Wikisource (version of 8 March 2017, 15:13 UTC) =Battle of Lobositz= The Battle of Lobositz, fought on 1 October 1756, was the first major battle of the Seven Years' War; the artillery played a significant role. The guns started firing at about 6:00 am, but it was occasional fire: after 7:00 am, the artillery put forth a sustained and effective effort.Herbert J. Redman, Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756-1763, McFarland, 2015, p.15. Although the Austrians held the higher ground as far as the infantry and cavalry were concerned, and the artillery thundered from the heights above the Prussian line so long and so loudly that even seasoned veterans became unnerved: some of the Croats in Maximilian Ulysses Reichsgraf von Browne's army fled to the rear of the field and even Browne himself, a life-long veteran, admitted to never hearing anything like it.Redman, p 17. From 1:00 pm onward, the Prussian howitzers pounded against the Austrian force so effectively the artillery used its ammunition at a rapid rate. The battle was not an unqualified success, although the Austrians abandoned the field which, in the 18th century, was tantamount to admitting defeat.Redman, p. 22. Moller was promoted to lieutenant colonel the day after the battle, 2 October 1756, and received the Order Pour le Mérite. Frederick wrote to Field Marshal Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin: \\"Moller has done miracles and secunded me in an astonishing manner.\\" =Battle of Rossbach= At the Battle of Rossbach, the center of action occurred around Moller's battery of 16 heavy guns and two howitzers on the Janushügel. Prince Henry's center, composed of infantry, had marched behind the Janus hill, and was supported by Seydlitz's seven regiments of horse. At about 3:00 pm, on the signal from Seydlitz himself, Moller's artillery opened fire on the Allied troops and tore huge gaps in their lines. The artillery first destroyed any semblance of order among the Allied cavalry, and then raked the infantry. The artillery fire was so thorough the concussion of the bombardment could be felt several miles away. Soubise and his staff thought the Prussians were retreating, and using the guns as cover, and simply hurried to get out of range, but this further disorganized the Allied lines, and caused unit cohesion to break down. Consequently, at 3:30 pm, when Seydlitz's squadrons descended on the Allied army, they wrought havoc among the infantry and cavalry who had remained in columns; those who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into Prince Henry's infantry. Again, artillery fire came into focus: Moller's battery on the Janus had been reinforced with three siege guns from Leipzig, and these huge guns battered the Austrians again. Rossbach proved that the column as a means of tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of Moller's fire; the greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.Redman, pp. 130-136. =Battle of Zorndorf= Moller also was present at Prague, Olomouc and Zorndorf. There, at Zorndorf, Moller's artillery was a key to the battle plan. Frederick's plan of attack was first to hammer the Russian right with heavy artillery fire and then to launch Heinrich von Manteuffel's advanced guard against it. Expecting cavalry, the Russians formed in a square, the best way to receive an mounted attack but the worst way to receive an artillery barrage. Moller opened fire with 60 total of his 18- and 24-pounders, placed in two locations around Zorndorf; the initial range was too far, so they closed about 600 paces, and then ripped the Russian squares apart. Russian sources reported that one particular cannon shot killed or wounded 48 grenadiers. Despite this accuracy, Moller's contribution at Zorndorf could not be measured in a single stroke, but in his ability to move his horse artillery around the battlefield. At 1:00 pm, they were in one place, firing canister into tightly-packed Russian formations; at 4:00 pm, they were another place, pounding the Russian line; at 7:00, they were elsewhere, preventing a Russian counter-attack.Redman, pp 210-217. =Last days= Frederick held Moller in high regard. Moller once told the King, \\"Your Majesty, all will be well, my genius will tell me\\", and the outcome had justified his confidence; Frederick frequently asked him in times of trouble, \\"what [did] his genius tell him\\". Moller died in Freiberg, Saxony, on 9 November 1762. Of the military men whose names are listed on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, Moller is one of only three who did not achieve the rank of general.Denkmal König Friedrichs des Großen: Enthüllt am 31.

It belongs to the class of Mollicutes which includes bacteria featuring reduced genome sizes that may be parasitic or commensal. It is a gram positive bacterium, however its cells lack a peptidoglycan layer. M. mobile cells are covered with membrane- anchored proteins, including surface proteins responsible for adhesion, or attachment to objects and surfaces, and antigenic variation, a mechanism which enables surface proteins to elude host immune responses. M. mobile survival is dependent upon surface proteins which allow it to bind and infect host cells, vary its own surface proteins in order to escape the host immune system, and transport nutrients and ions.  Structure  The M. mobile cell is divided into three parts: the head, neck, and body. The proteins involved in gliding and adhesion, named Gli123, Gli349, and Gli521, are found at the neck. On the surface of M. mobile lies variable surface proteins (Mvsps) made up of 11 genes including mvspA and mvspP. These proteins are considered to be involved in the parasitism of M. mobile. The lack of a peptidoglycan layer within M. mobile creates a flexible cell wall, enabling the bacterium to form a protrusion and glide in a smooth manner. As a result of this cell wall structure, M. mobile is the fastest moving mycoplasma species recorded.  Gliding direction M. mobile moves in a gliding manner along a curved path in the direction of the cell protrusion, otherwise known as the cell pole. The protrusion of the cell, which extends from the cell membrane and consists of hundreds of miniature legs which attach to distant cells, pulls the M. mobile. The gliding machinery, consisting of a large structure of surface proteins, forms at the protrusion. The legs, which are approximately 50-nm long, are protein molecules on the cell surface that aid the cell's motility. This process enables M. mobile to move and releases sialylated oligosaccharides (carbohydrates that have reacted with sialic acid) onto the surface of the object in which the cell attaches to. The proteins on the surface of M. mobile then pull the sialylated oligosaccharides on the foreign cell surface through the use of energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis. Through the use of this action M. mobile is recorded to move 2.0 to 4.5 μm per second on solid surfaces. At this speed, the M. mobile is moving 3 to 7 times the length of the cell per second.  Studies  Studies of M. mobile began in 1997, and new research is continually occurring. Many studies involving the individual proteins on the surface of M. mobile have been conducted, however, a detailed image of the complete cell surface has yet to be produced.

The term \\"niece\\" was often used to mean that the person was an illegitimate child rather than a niece, so it is possible that she was really Henry's bastard daughter.Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 71 The historian Frank Barlow also implies that she could have been Henry's daughter rather than his niece.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 236 Against this, Kathleen Thompson argues that Henry was not shy about recognizing his bastards, and that it is more likely that Sibyl was the daughter of Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose. Robert was Duke of Normandy from 1086 (although he pawned it in 1096 to another brother, William Rufus, to finance going on the First Crusade),Clanchy England and Its Rulers p. 46 and Falaise was where Robert's legitimate son, William Clito, was being raised.Thompson \\"Affairs of State\\" Journal of Medieval History pp. 150–151 Katharine Keats-Rohan argues instead that Sibyl was the younger daughter of William de Falaise and Geva de Burcy.

I. J. Sanders does not believe Sibyl was William's daughter, but does not speculate further on her ancestry. If Sibyl was a bastard, nothing is known of her mother.Given Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 63 Thompson speculates that if Sibyl was the daughter of Robert, Sibyl's mother may have been someone employed in raising William Clito and that Sibyl was named for Robert's deceased wife, Sibyl of Conversano.

Lucrezia was born in Florence in 1435, the daughter of Francesco Buti and Caterina Ciacchi. She became a nun in the Dominican monastery of Santa Margherita in Prato. According to Vasari, while a novice or boarder at the monastery, she met the painter Fra Filippo Lippi who in 1456 had been commissioned to paint a picture for the nuns' high altar. Lippi requested Buti as a model for the Virgin in the painting he was creating for them. Lippi fell in love with Buti during her sittings for the painting and caused a great scandal by kidnapping her from a procession of the Girdle of Thomas in Prato and took her to his nearby home. Despite attempts to force her to return to the monastery, Buti remained at Lippi's house at the piazza del Duomo. In 1457, Buti bore Lippi a son, Filippino, and in 1465 a daughter, Alessandra.

Born in Dulwich, Skinner began working for the Post Office, firstly delivering telegraphs, then as a postman, and as a sorter. He became active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), probably under the influence of his wife, Phillis Emerson, who also convinced him to become a vegetarian and free thinker.John Saville, \\"Skinner, (James) Allen\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.198-200 Skinner opposed World War I as a socialist and a pacifist. He was a conscientious objector, but also refused to take up alternative employment, and so was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs in 1916. The prison authorities refused to provide vegetarian food, so Skinner suffered greatly from hunger. Although he was released three months later, he again refused military service, and was imprisoned a second time. While imprisoned, he contracted tuberculosis, which left him with a permanent disability affecting his knee and elbow. In 1919, Skinner found work with the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW), and relocated to Manchester in 1920 as the union moved its head office there. He soon became assistant editor of the union's journal, The Post, and wrote numerous articles for it. He moved back to London a few years later, continuing to work for the union, but became increasingly prominent in the ILP. He stood as the Labour Party candidate for Hendon at the 1924 United Kingdom general election, and for Clapham in 1929, and also served as secretary of the ILP's London and Southern Counties division. He supported the ILP's disaffiliation from the Labour Party in 1931 and remained active in the smaller party. During World War II, Skinner served as an adviser to the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, and after the war, he was secretary of the No Conscription Council and chair of the board of Peace News. He retired from the UPW in 1950, and devoted more time to Peace News, including a period as editor from 1952 to 1955. During this period, he worked closely with A. J. Muste and the two were leading members of the \\"Third Way Movement\\". He was also involved in anti-nuclear campaigning, becoming a sponsor of the Emergency Committee for Direct Action against Nuclear War and was active in the Direct Action Committee. For demonstrating at a rocket base in Harrington, he was sentenced to two months in prison, spending his seventieth birthday there.

Life Italia Conti was born in London in 1873, the daughter of Luigi Conti, an opera singer and member of Garibaldi's Mille expedition. His wife, Italia's mother was Emily Mary Castle (1843–1914). The family moved to Brighton. Luigi Conti died in 1917 in Brookwood Asylum. Italia was educated in Haywards Heath and at Kensington Academy. Conti wrote to Ellen Terry, who arranged acting lessons for her. Her debut as an actress was a small part in The Last Word at the Lyceum Theatre, London. Conti helped to train a young Gertrude Lawrence without charge (Gertrude's family was unable to pay) and get a start in theatre. In 1908, Gertrude Lawrence's mother, Alice was working for extra money in the chorus of the Christmas pantomime at Brixton Theatre, when she heard about Conti, now 35, who was teaching dance, elocution and the rudiments of acting. Gertrude auditioned for Conti, who decided the 10 year old Gertrude was talented enough to warrant free lessons. Lawrence later joined Where the Rainbow Ends,\\"Foreword\\" by Italia Conti in the Where the Rainbow Ends', 18th ed. on which Conti was working. Conti's training also would lead to Lawrence's appearance in Max Reinhardt's The Miracle staged in London and Fifinella, directed by Basil Dean, for the Liverpool Repertory Theatre (now the Liverpool Playhouse). Charles Hawtrey had asked Italia Conti to train the children to act in Where the Rainbow Ends. Doing this led to Conti's founding of her drama school, the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. In 1925 the academy moved to Lamb's Conduit Street. Bombing in May 1940 destroyed the building, and Conti faced a serious financial loss. The school would be revived, however, at the Tavistock Little Theatre in Bloomsbury. Conti's pupil Gertrude Lawrence went on to be a great star of the theatre. Italia Conti died at Evelyn Cottage, Southbourne, Bournemouth, on 8 February 1946. Her school survived into the 21st century, and is in operation as of March 2020.

While based in Malaysia, Shakir served as an al-Qaeda “fixer” and provided logistical support in the planning of the attacks on the USS Cole, the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and other terrorist attacks. Shakir was arrested in Qatar days after the 9/11 attacks, but was subsequently released and ultimately returned to Iraq.  History  In 1999, Shakir began working as a VIP greeter for Malaysian Airlines, a position he obtained with the help of a contact at the Iraqi embassy, as reported by The Weekly Standard. On January 5, 2000, Shakir escorted September 11 hijacker Khalid al Mihdhar to a waiting car and joined him for al-Qaeda planning meetings in Kuala Lumpur, later named the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. After the meetings, Shakir reported to work at the airport twice before disappearing. Six days after the 9/11 attacks, on September 17, 2001, Qatari authorities searched his person and apartment and arrested Shakir. During the search, authorities found contact information for multiple senior-level al-Qaeda members tied to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Operation Bojinka, the 1998 United States embassy bombings, and the attack on USS. Cole both on his body and in his apartment. Shakir's contacts included the brother of 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. American officials were reportedly aware that Shakir was acting an associate of two 9/11 hijackers who attended the January 2000 meeting in Malaysia and FBI officials were “eager to interview Shakir.” However, Qatari authorities released Shakir, allowing him to flee the country. Shakir was detained in Amman, Jordan en route to Iraq on October 21, 2001, and was held in Jordan for three months before being allowed to return to Iraq.  Confusion over names  In 2004, allegations emerged that Shakir, as a senior-ranking al-Qaeda member, was an officer in Saddam Hussein's private militia. Iraqi military documents named Lt. Col. Hikmat Shakir Ahmad as a member of Fedayeen Saddam. The Weekly Standard published an article which speculated that the al-Qaeda member was a member of Saddam Hussein's militia. However, a 2004 article in the Washington Post quoted a senior Bush administration official who believed that names indicated two different individuals. The 9/11 Commission Report claimed that despite the confusion over Shakir's identity, the al-Qaeda member was still in police custody in Qatar when the Iraqi Fedayeen colonel with a similar name was in Iraq.

She was WCA's first and longest- serving secretary. She campaigned on various social issues and was active in the Quaker relief work for European refugees (Society of Friends); the Barns School for delinquent city boys and the Edinburgh Old People's Welfare Council.  Early life  Agnes Syme Macdonald was born on 8 September 1882 at 23 Dublin Street, Edinburgh. She was the only daughter of Euphemia Henderson (born in Kinross) and Alexander Macdonald (born in Kiltarlity, Inverness). Agnes was the fifth of six children. Alexander Macdonald was a wine and spirit merchant in Edinburgh and Euphemia, took over the business in 1893.  Political career  Agnes joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and says about this choice: ‘Possibly it's because I was a so-called “lady of leisure” … At that time there were too many women running around with no training to do anything’. She was among the Scottish women who travelled to London to take part in the protests in early March 1912 after the government announced that no further time would be given to the Conciliation Bill, which would have introduced a measure of women's suffrage. Agnes broke a police office window with a hammer and was charged with malicious damage on 5 March 1912 and given two months' hard labour. In 1913 Agnes served as the secretary of the Edinburgh branch of the WSPU. However, she became alienated by the militant suffrage campaigns and helped set up the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (WCA) in 1918. Such Women's citizens' associations were formed throughout Britain to politically organize women and to promote women's representation. The Edinburgh association was inaugurated in Edinburgh city chambers on 9 May 1918. According to minutes from a WCA meeting in 1918-1919 the hall were filled with women, who showed keen interest and great enthusiasm in the new movement’. Agnes was the WCA's first and longest-serving secretary.

She continued her career as a campaigner in the Quaker relief work for European refugees (Society of Friends); the Barns School for delinquent city boys and the Edinburgh Old People's Welfare Council.  Private life  Agnes cared for her younger, disabled brother Roddy. She shared a house with him in Strathfillan Road, Edinburgh. Agnes remained unmarried and had no children. She died on 21 October 1966, aged eighty-four, after staying in a nursing home, at St Raphael's Home, Blackford Avenue, Edinburgh.

As an artist, he created Realist acrylic paintings and watercolors of urban and suburban scenes, predominantly in the Washington, D.C., area, where he lived and exhibited.  Biography  Val Lewton was born May 23, 1937, in Santa Monica, California. His father, also named Val Lewton, produced a string of successful and influential B movies for RKO Pictures, including Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943). His mother, Ruth Knapp, was a painter and teacher of autistic children. He graduated from Whitman College (1959) in Walla Walla, Washington, and earned a Master of Fine Arts from Claremont University (1962). After moving to Washington, D.C., he served on the staff of the Smithsonian American Art Museum for 32 years, while maintaining a career as a painter in his own right. Lewton died in 2015 from metastatic melanoma. Soon afterwards, exhibitions of his paintings were planned for the Katzen Arts Center (June 17 – August 13, 2017) and Addison/Ripley Fine Art (June 3 – July 8, 2017).  Career  =Painter= Chiefly known for his landscapes, Lewton generally depicted cities and suburbs with a detached, impersonal sensibility. Writing about his watercolors in Arts magazine in 1980, Harry Rand observed, “Either by implication or statement, personalities are absent from Lewton’s work; there is hardly a sense of the lives that move through those spaces he describes.” The critic compared the artist to Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, and Charles Sheeler. Lewton painted from a young age. On a family trip to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, he discovered the work of Henri Matisse, an encounter that permanently influenced his artistic vision. In the early 1960s, Lewton lived in southern California and taught art classes at the University of California Riverside. During this period, he was inspired by the paintings of Roger Kuntz and the murals of José Clemente Orozco. In 1963, he reached out to his former Claremont professor, David Scott, then Assistant Director of the National Collection of Fine Arts, who encouraged him to apply to the Smithsonian Institution. The result was a cross-country move to the Washington, D.C. area, and two years later he was included in the Corcoran Gallery’s annual group exhibition of local artists. In 1973, the Studio Gallery gave Lewton his first solo exhibition in D.C., “Val Lewton Is Dale City,” a title derived from the Virginia suburb of Dale City. In 1985, The Corcoran’s 1985 “Washington Show” included Lewton’s large-scale painting “H Street Demolition,” created the previous year. His 60-by-100-foot “Airshaft Mural,” painted in 1988, relies on a trompe l'oeil effect that gives the viewers the impression of seeing through a concrete pylon built over I-395 to the U.S Capitol Building. \\"I sort of wanted to emphasize the concrete,\\" Lewton told The Washington Post’s John Kelly. \\"I thought if it looked like it had been penetrated, it would make it look even more solid than it was.\\" = Exhibition designer = Alongside his artistic career, Lewton became known for designing museum exhibitions in ways that suited the style of the artists featured. During his tenure at the National Museum of American Art, which later became the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), he created experiences for visitors to discover the work of Robert Rauschenberg, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Thomas Cole, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frederic Remington, among others. “Val often incorporated a special element in his designs to evoke the era being displayed — sometimes as simple as a drapery to evoke a Gilded Age parlor,” stated SAAM director Elizabeth Broun in Lewton’s Washington Post obituary. He later worked on a freelance basis for the Phillips Collection and other institutions. In a 2013 blog post for the Phillips, manager of exhibitions Liz Strelka called Lewton the museum's \\"secret weapon.\\" Strelka praised him as \\"a constant and integral part of our exhibitions, and the unsung hero of many an installation, carefully constructing a design layout and paint scheme for most of our special exhibitions, and transforming our spaces for each new exhibition to highlight the inherent qualities of artists and their work on display.\\"  Work in public collections  *National Gallery of Art Corcoran Collection *Smithsonian American Art Museum *The Phillips Collection *American University Katzen Center *The Fralin Museum of Art, University of Virginia *George Washington University *Towson State College *University of the District of Columbia *University of Vermont *The Wilson Building, Washington, DC *DC Commission on Arts & Humanities, Washington, DC References  External links  *https://www.vallewtonpainter.com *http://www.northgallerydesign.com 1937 births 2015 deaths American painters American designers Artists from Santa Monica, California University of California, Riverside faculty Whitman College alumni ","title":"Val Lewton (visual artist)"},{"id":"53423163","text":"Run Away Home is a 1997 book by Patricia McKissack.

It was demolished in 1491 during construction on the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. Name and location San Ciriaco was located near the Via Lata, not far from the so-called arcus Diburi, which was afterwards called the Camilianum. Mariano Armellini describes the arcus Diburi as an ancient arch surmounted by the tower, which was believed to be an entrance to a Roman monument called the Diribitorium, a large building begun by Agrippa, and finished by Augustus. It was apparently used to count votes and distribute salaries to the Roman militias, and its name derives from the diribitores, or election officials. It burned under Titus, together with the adjacent Iseum. By the Middle Ages, the old name of the arch had been lost in common parlance, and it was called arco maggiore (\\"large arch\\") or the arco di Camillo (although according to Christian Hülsen that name was more the result of mistaken scholarship in the sixteenth century than an indication that the site was ever associated with someone named Camillus). The arch was eventually named the Camillianum, which was applied to the neighborhood, and by extension, the church of San Ciriaco. Its dedication was to Saint Cyriacus, a Roman martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution, whose relics were kept in the church. History The former location of S. Ciriaco has been identified with the current high altar of S. Maria in Via Lata (shown here). The origins of the church are underhood to be quite ancient, although Armellini notes that the tradition of it dating back to the time of Pope Sylvester is not quite worthy of belief. The church had a substantial connection to Cyriacus himself. His bodies, along with those of his two martyred companions, Largus and Smaragdus, were brought to Rome at the beginning of the fourth century. Their original resting place was near the Porta Salaria. From there they were moved to a cemetery near the Via Ostiensis, and finally, in about the tenth century to transferred — not to the church named after him, but to the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. In 1491, Pope Innocent VIII ordered a complete reconstruction and expansion of the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata, which required the church of San Ciriaco to be demolished. Giovanni Severano attests that San Ciriaco was located precisely where the high altar of Santa Maria in Via Lata is today. The main portal of the church would have been accessed from the modern Via Lata, which connects the Via del Corso to the Piazza del Collegio Romano. =Relation to the stational liturgy= Another church dedicated to Saint Cyriacus in the city — San Ciriaco in Thermis — was one of the stationes of the ancient Roman stational liturgy, formerly assigned to Tuesday of the fifth week of Lent. The twelfth-century Ordo Romanus XVI provides that San Ciriaco as the site of that day's liturgy. Because it had fallen into ruins, a new station at Santi Quirico e Giulitta was assigned to the day by Pope Sixtus IV (1474–1484). The station was later transferred to Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) in recognition of the fact that the relics of Saint Cyriacus had been transferred there from San Ciriaco de Camiliano. Santa Maria in Via Lata remains the assigned station for Tuesday of the fifth week of Lent. Monastery The church was noted for the monastery of Ss. Ciriaco e Niccolò (Saints Cyriacus and Nicholas), which was attached to it. Hülsen traces the origin of this monastery to the tenth century, citing a document from 972 that refers to monasterium sancti Christi martyris Cyriaci atque Nicolai confessoris, quod ponitur in Via Lata. Armellini states that the name of Saint Nicholas was added to the monastery because there was a church dedicated to him nearby (S. Nicolaus de Pinea), which was eventually subsumed by the monastery complex. Hülsen, on the other hand, writes that the additional dedication was due to the translation of some of St. Nicholas' relics in the tenth century, while acknowledging the existence of the church that Armellini mentions. The monastery, having fallen into decadence, was suppressed by Pope Eugene IV with a bull of March 19, 1435. Armellini reports finding in the Vatican Archives a document attesting to the discovery of the cemetery of the ancient monastery church complex, further establishing its location on the current site of Santa Maria in Via Lata: the ruins had been found while the Pamphili family were paving part of their garden to set up a stable. This was during the lifetime of Olimpia Aldobrandini (1623–1681). In the treasury of the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata, Armellini reports having seen a parchment codex, finished with a cover of beaten silver plate, adorned with cut glass, and containing an ancient copy of the Gospel of Luke. Inside is a dedication, written by the abbess of the monastery of Ss. Ciriaco e Niccolò: Suscipe Christe et s. Cyriace atque Nicolae. Hoc opus ego Berta Ancilla Dei fieri iussi. The Gospel book was believed to date from the eleventh century.

She was the longest prison serving suffragette. She worked for Christabel Pankhurst but was sacked; she then worked for Sylvia Pankhurst under name Mary Pederson (or Paterson). In later life she supported women's and children's organisations.  Early life  Mary Elizabeth Phillips was born in St. Mary Bourne, Hampshire, the daughter of William Fleming Phillips and Louisa Elizabeth (Simms) Phillips. Her father was a doctor who worked in Glasgow.  Suffrage activism  Phillips was encouraged by her father to campaign for women's rights and in 1904 she became a paid official of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage. She later reported that this taught her that quiet campaigning was not going to be sufficient and she joined the more radical Women's Social & Political Union in 1907 and established a Glasgow branch of the WSPU. She wrote articles for Forward which was the journal of the Glasgow Independent Labour Party. Phillips assisted Helen Fraser with campaigns for the movement in East Fife. Her next WSPU campaign was in the West of England organising visit plans with Annie Kenney, Elsie Howey, Gladice Keevil, Clara Codd and later was on the platform, speaking in Plymouth in November 1908 with Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt. In March 1908 she had been sentenced to six weeks in Holloway Prison following a demonstration outside the House of Commons. As part of another delegation in June 1908, with Emmeline Pankhurst, twelve women including Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Jessie Stephenson, Florence Haig, Maud Joachim and Phillips were turned away from an arranged visit to the Prime Minister on 30 June 1908 and a crowd of supporters tried to rush through a police line who responded with physical force , resulting in a further arrest and 3-month sentence, making Phillips the longest serving suffragette prisoner. A postcard picture of a suffragette being arrested by police is said to be of Phillips. When Phillips was released from prison she was welcomed by Flora Drummond, bagpipes and other suffragettes who posed in tartan for a picture under the slogan \\"Ye Mauna Tramp on the Scotch Thistle Laddie\\". The Scottish suffragettes present compared their struggle to the campaign of William Wallace.alt= Phillips showed other suffragettes different forms of protest, including getting Charlie Marsh to help her pavement chalking in Lambeth, whom Philips noted 'gamely stood the jeering and rough handling' the women got in the process. Her next location from January 1909, was in Newcastle and then back south to Cornwall and Devon. She was among the welcoming party for another released prisoner Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, in April 1909, with the Pankhursts, two Kenney sisters, Vera Wentworth, Minnie Baldock and Mary Gawthorpe. They were taken to join 500 suffragettes at a celebration lunch at the Criterion, Picadilly Circus restaurant. Phillips was arrested later in 1909 again with Vera Wentworth and Elsie Howie for attempting to force their attendance at a men's meeting in Exeter where Lord Carrington in charge of the Agriculture and Fisheries Board was speaking. During her seven days imprisoned she went on hunger strike and was released after four days 'in a dangerous state'. Other WSPU leaders Mary Blathwayt, Emily Blathwayt, wrote in their diaries about Phillips suffering from fainting, and Emmeline Pankhurst wrote to her \\"my dear girl take care of yourself and do everything in your power to recover your health and strength.\\" Phillips also carried out what Christabel Pankhurst called a 'splendid protest' showing ' pluck and ingenuity' by hiding under the stage overnight, jumping out shouting 'Votes for Women' and objecting to Patricia Woodlock's imprisonment when two Cabinet Ministers were being awarded honorary degrees in Liverpool St George's Hall. Millicent Browne planting a tree at Eagle House (suffragette's rest) with Mary Phillips, Vera Wentworth, Elsie Howey and Annie Kenney Phillips was invited to Mary Blathwayt's home at Batheaston where the leading suffragettes met and recovered. It was known as the \\"Suffragette's Rest\\". Significant visitors were asked to plant a tree (in Phiilips case a Picea Pungens Glauca) to record their achievements on behalf of the cause e.g. a prison sentence. Phillips had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. In November 1909, Phillips wrote to Christabel Pankhurst asking to be relieved of a militant role, which was fully supported and she had no further trouble for the next three years. Around that time she was given the job of being the WSPU organiser in Liverpool but this was short lived and Ada Flatman took over that role. In 1910 Phillips was sent as WSPU organiser for Bradford, when Mrs Pankhurst wrote to her seeking her help to ensure that the women's group did not express sympathy for the loss of Pankhurst's 20-year old son Harry, who had died of polio, by saying ' I want to get through my work, and I know you will all help me do it'. Phillips work at the WSPU mostly under Christabel Pankhurst who had praised her and increased her salary. In late 1912 her own mother, also in the WSPU, had not called Mary to her deathbed in Cornwall due to her belief that the 'movement needed her services'. But on 9 July 1913 she was sacked by Christabel Pankhurst who wrote saying \\"that you are not effective as a district organiser\\"; this may have been due to Phillips no longer strongly favouring militancy. Despite her long support working all over the country, four imprisonments and hunger strike, Phillips had to advertise her own services in 'situations wanted' in The Suffragette. She moved to London's East End, living in Canning Town and immediately went to work with Nora Smyth for Sylvia Pankhurst's rival East London Federation of Suffragettes, with Pankhurst, Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Millie Lansbury, Eveline Haverfield, Nellie Cressall and George Lansbury. Phillips continued to promote socialism and wrote for The Women's Dreadnought weekly for working women. She became the full time paid organiser for the federation working with May Billinghurst. In 1916 she was working for the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage who did not support (or decry) militancy. She now went under the name of Mary Pederson or Paterson. Mary inspired working women such as Charlotte Drake, a seamstress and barmaid, a chemical worker's wife and mother of four children under 8 years old, to also become an activist for women's suffrage. Drake was interviewed on the BBC in 1968 and explained the unusual support her husband gave when she was heckled by men about a women's place in society. = Later life = Phillips went on to work for the United Suffragists from 1915-16, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and Save the Children Fund. Phillips edited a brewing trade news service from 1928-1955, and then was an editor for the Council of Social Work. She joined the Suffragette Fellowship and Six Point Group, and in an interview in 1955 bemoaned the 'sneaky way' women got the vote as a 'sort of anti-climax really' but 'was very good to be part of it'.

In January 1933, when the Nazis took power, he was already a member of the Communist Party. The Nazis lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity became illegal, and after the Reichstag Fire in February 1933, the authorities devoted particular energy to outlawing activities undertaken on behalf of the Communist Party. Garske nevertheless remained politically active, producing satirical cartoons for the illegal newspapers produced by peace activists. 1933 was also the year in which Erich Garske married Charlotte Schaepe. By the end of 1933 many German communist activists had been arrested, while others had fled into exile. The Garskes did not emigrate and were not, in the short term, arrested. Indeed, when the Communist Party in exile smuggled people back into Germany from Prague, Moscow or Paris to work on party matters, one of the places where they might be hidden and accommodated was in the Garskes' apartment in central Berlin.

Work  Sophy Sanger worked for the Women's Trade Union League from 1903 to 1909, setting up its legal advice bureau whilst learning labour law at University College London. Her work on insurance regulations for workplace compensation meant she was called to give evidence before a parliamentary commission in the House of Lords and she helped Labour MPs prepare their case for the Shops Bill. In 1905, Sanger founded a British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation, publishing an English version of its French and German Bulletins. Between 1909 and 1919, she wrote for and edited World's Labour Laws, a quarterly publication which campaigned on issues such as the abolition of child labour, the prohibition of the use of white phosphorus and lead and the prevention of anthrax. She believed that international cooperation and action on specific, practical reforms could effectively combat many worker's rights issues, for example: sweated labour, occupational disease and workplace injury. Sophy Sanger was appointed chief of the International Labour Organization's legislative section, a post she held from its formation in 1919 until 1924. She returned to Britain in 1924 and read for the bar at Gray's Inn, publishing an authoritative article on labour law for the Encyclopaedia Britannica Sanger died of illness on 7 December 1950 in Cambridge.

She is best known for her hand-painted tiles of fairytales, especially of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Cinderella.  Early life  Lucy Jane Faulkner was born to Benjamin and Ann Faulkner on 16 November 1839 in Birmingham, England. She had two surviving siblings, Charles Joseph Faulkner and Kate Faulkner. They lived in Birmingham until the death of their father, and moved to Bloomsbury after his death. It is unknown what caused his death. Charles had become friends with William Morris when they were both students at Oxford, and through that friendship, Morris was also acquainted with Lucy and Kate. She later married an engraver named Harvey Edward Orrinsmith (son of John Orrin Smith) and changed her surname in the middle of her artistic career. Artistic career Lucy's brother Charles and their friend William Morris founded the company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., which specialized in home and furniture decoration. At first, Charles hired her and Kate as amateurs just to help with the company, but as they continued working and growing their skills, they were eventually received as legitimate artists and were paid for their labor and compensation. Lucy also became one of the first managers for the company. While her sister Kate dabbled in nearly every aspect of home decorating (including embroidery, tile painting, engraving, gesso painting, and especially wallpaper design), Lucy focused more on painting tiles by hand, which is what she became best known for in the company and as an artist. Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith was mostly known for her tile paintings of women, particularly from fairytales and legends. Many of her tiles were themed after the Legende of Goode Wimmen, in which there are many depictions of women of classical antiquity. Along with this, she painted stories such as Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast, which were painted in sequence to be hung as mantelpieces over the fireplace. Her paintings of the story of Sleeping Beauty are the more popular of the three stories. After she married Harvey Edward Orrinsmith, however, she stopped painting tiles for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., and changed her surname from Faulkner to Orrinsmith. This is one of the primary reasons that she is overshadowed by her sister, Kate. For this reason, many of her works were previously mis-attributed to Kate Faulkner, until it was discovered that Lucy would sign her tiles with either LJF or simply LF. Orrinsmith was also known for writing a book about drawing room decoration entitled The Drawing Room: Its Decorations and Furniture while living in Beckenham, simply under the name “Mrs. Orrinsmith”. In the book, she emphasizes the importance of “properly” decorating the elements of drawing rooms, including ceilings, walls, moldings, fireplaces, chimneys, skirting, and much more. She also emphasizes using colors that were popular at the time and delves a little into color theory. Lucy also illustrated diagrams depicting how to properly arrange elements within the room and how to decorate everything to look visually appealing to guests. Orrinsmith received plenty of negative criticism and reviews of her book, as many thought that she was very harsh, and that the illustrations that she included as diagrams were of poor quality and did not reflect the skill level that she lectured about in the book. Death and legacy She died in 1910 of unknown causes. Most of her work is located at the William Morris Gallery in London, which has the largest surviving collection of her hand-painted tiles up on display.

Mona Wilson (29 May 1872 – 26 October 1954) was a British civil servant and author. She is known for her scholarly work, including The Life of William Blake (1927) and other biographies of literary and historical figures. As a civil servant, she was one of the first women in the United Kingdom to earn equal pay for her work. Life Wilson was born in Hillmorton Road, Rugby to James Wilson (headmaster of Clifton College ) and Annie Elizabeth Moore. She was educated at Clifton High School, Bristol; St Leonard's School, St Andrews; and Newnham College, Cambridge. Wilson became interested in social and industrial problems after she graduated and went on to join the Women's Trade Union League. Wilson became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League in 1899. After being appointed to the National Insurance Commission in 1911, she received a yearly salary of £1000, making her the highest-paid woman civil servant of the time and one of the first women to receive equal pay in the United Kingdom. In 1917, she was involved in creating a mothers' Pensions bill. In 1919, she retired from civil service and began to work on her writing. In 1932, she was made an Associate of Cambridge University.  Writing  She wrote several scholarly works after her retirement from the civil service in 1919, including The Life of William Blake (1927), which went through several reprintings and remained popular for several decades. Her biography of William Blake was considered to be very accessible by Angus Whitehead. The Guardian wrote that Wilson \\"told his story more fully and sensibly than anyone else.\\" The Observer states that her biography was \\"the most satisfactory since Gilchrist.\\" Wilson was featured in Grand Tour: A Journey in the Tracks of the Age of Aristocracy (1935), where she contributes a piece about the Wife of Bath.

The book was described by The Guardian as being very thorough in its understanding of the people of Austen's time, though a little difficult to follow if the reader is not familiar with the time period. Wilson also published a short story under the nom de plume \\"An Ordeal\\" in The Nation in 1909 and a novella \\"The Story of Rosalind Retold From Her Diary\\" as \\"Monica Moore\\" in 1910.

She served as the first president of the Michigan State Equal Suffrage Association, as well as parliamentarian of the International Label League. She was also the author of a book on parliamentary law. While still a child, she signed the temperance movement pledge under one of the original Washingtonians, later joining the Good Templars and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Early years and education Mary Lydia Thompson was born in Conneaut, Ohio on July 27, 1836, the daughter of Rev. Volney and Lovinia (Singer) Thompson. Her immediate ancestors, the Thompsons and Harpers, emigrated from Vermont and settled in that portion of Ohio known as the Western Reserve. At nine years of age, she was sent to the Conneaut Academy, then just completed. At 15, she began to teach a country school US$1.00 a week and \\"boarded around.\\" Later, she attended the State Normal School (now known as Edinboro University of Pennsylvania) in Edinboro, Pennsylvania. She signed the temperance pledge under one of the original Washingtonians when only eight years old. Career In 1853, Doe joined the Good Templars. In 1878, she became a member of the Michigan Grand Lodge of Good Templars, and held the office of grand vice-templar and of grand assistant secretary for several years. She further showed her interest in temperance by joining the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the various other temperance organizations in the towns where she lived. From the time of the defeat of the suffrage amendment to the Michigan State constitution in 1874, there was no central organization in Michigan for ten years, although a few local societies maintained an existence. In 1877, Doe went to Saginaw, Michigan, where she at once made friends with the advocates of equal suffrage. Through a conjunction of these forces, a convention was called at Flint on May 21, 1884, which resulted in the forming of a State Equal Suffrage Association, with Doe as President, and Governor Josiah Begole as vice-president. She held that office for six years, was active in securing many of the privileges granted to women by the Michigan Legislature, and spent much of her time with other equal suffragists in the State capital. Doe was elected parliamentarian of the International Label League. She was the author of a book on parliamentary law, as well as conducting departments for various newspapers on subjects such as temperance, labor, and woman suffrage. She changed her residence from Saginaw to Bay City in 1886, and opened a store for fancy goods. While a member of Methodist Episcopal Church, she taught Bible classes.

It was released on September 4, 2015 by Deckdisc. The album has twelve tracks, besides the hit song \\"Catraca\\", featuring Mr. Catra. The lead single is \\"É da Rádio,\\" with a production inspired by The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\\".  Background and development  The band's previous album, Motel, earned the attention from the internet and was very well received by critics. Mateus Carrilho said in an interview that the band's new album would have more less brega music and more pop, reaching larger audiences with radio-friendly songs. He further stated that the new album would be different from the band's previous releases. In search of new sonorities, the band got to collaborate with different producers, including Boss in Drama, Rodrigo Gorky, Pedrowl and Bernardo Martins. The band co-wrote all of the songs: \\"It was a delight to do this second album, ideas bubbled up and we put everything out,\\" Davi Sabbag said.  Critical reception  In its first review, Veneno was praised for its production, since it maintains the good humor that marked the debut of the band, but with a vast sweep of inspirations, mainly from what was being successful in Brazil in the 90s. For Brazilian website It Pop, the album \\"demonstrates that [the band] still has a lot to explore within their influences\\" and \\"while they play with songwriting that revives the national pop, awakening in us a more determined appetite for this genre so underestimated [in Brazil] (...) they go through references to past decades, however looking forward.\\" The website still compared the sound to artists such as Mamonas Assassinas, Bonde do Rolê and Blitz. Portal Famosos Brasil also provided the album a favorable review, stating that \\"Veneno ends with an auricular injection of adrenaline, extroversion and euphoria that leave the bittersweet taste of 'I want more'\\" and \\"with the wonderful trashy cover art to the commercial yet risky content they prove, once again, that pop music doesn't need to be taken seriously to have quality.\\"  Copyright claims  The music video for Arregaçada was removed from the band's YouTube channel after alleged accusations that they didn't have permission to use the sample of MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This – which in turn samples Rick James's Super Freak – in the video. Before being removed the video had only 4,8 million views. As of November 2017, the video has been made available on the channel.

Early life and education  Mary Susan McIntosh was born on 13 March 1936 in Hampstead, North London, to Helena Agnes (Jenny) Britton and her husband Albert William McIntosh, a Jedburgh-born businessman and graduate of the University of Edinburgh, who went on to become the first Professor of Marketing at the London Business School. Both parents were socialists, members of the 1917 Club and later the Communist Party. Her elder brother, Andrew Robert McIntosh, was a Labour politician and minister who was created a life peer, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, in 1982. McIntosh was educated at High Wycombe School for Girls and St Anne's College, Oxford, where she read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduating in 1958, she moved to the United States where she worked as a graduate student and teaching assistant in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1960, she was deported from the US for speaking out against the House Un-American Activities Committee.  Academic career  On her return to the UK, McIntosh worked as a researcher for the Home Office from 1961 to 1963 before taking up the post of lecturer in Sociology at the University of Leicester from 1963 to 1968. She later worked at Borough Polytechnic from 1968 to 1972, and as a research fellow studying prostitution at Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1972 to 1975. She joined the University of Essex in 1975 as a lecturer in the Department of Sociology. She later became the first female head of the department, and remained at the University until she retired in 1996. Throughout her career she taught a wide range of courses covering criminology, theory, sociology, social policy, the family, gender studies, feminism and Marxism.  Research  = Criminology and social constructionism = McIntosh's earliest research was in the field of criminology and the sociology of homosexuality. In 1968 she published the paper \\"The Homosexual Role\\" in the journal Social Problems. Based on a survey of gay men in Leicester and London, this paper argued that rather than being a psychiatric or clinical pathology, homosexuality and same sex relationships were influenced by historical and cultural factors, and that \\"homosexual\\" is a social category coercively imposed on some individuals for the purpose of social control. This paper has been described as being crucial in the shaping of social constructionism, a theory later developed by, and widely attributed to, the French philosopher Michel Foucault. McIntosh was critical of the orthodox view of criminology and in 1967 became one of the co-founders of the National Deviancy Symposium following the Third National Conference of Teaching and Research on Criminology at the University of Cambridge. Influenced by sociological approaches and American symbolic interactionism, the Symposium aimed to challenge dominant orthodoxies of crime and deviance and to instigate radical and critical approaches to criminology. Although McIntosh moved away from the field of academic criminology in the mid-1970s, she was a member of the Policy Advisory Committee to the Criminal Law Revision Committee from 1976 to 1985 which reviewed legislation relating to sexual offences. Through this committee, she was involved in efforts to lower the age of male homosexual consent from 21 to 18.  Gay and women's rights  In 1970, McIntosh and her partner Elizabeth Wilson were among a small group of lesbians who contributed to founding and shaping the direction of the London Gay Liberation Front at the London School of Economics. McIntosh was influential within the Gay Liberation Front and was one of the small group that authored the Gay Liberation Front: Manifesto in 1971. Along with a group of feminist colleagues McIntosh founded the journal Feminist Review in 1979, and remained an active member of the journal collective until the early 1990s. McIntosh was committed to campaigning for the legal and financial rights of married and co-habiting women, a cause she pursued with the Fifth Demand Group. McIntosh was also an active member of Feminists Against Censorship, a group of sex positive feminists founded in 1989, who argued against censorship of pornography and defended sexual expression and the right to produce sexually explicit material. McIntosh argued against radical separatist feminist critiques of pornography. Throughout her life McIntosh continued to forge links between the gay liberation movement, the women's movement and lesbian movements.  Politics  McIntosh espoused a sophisticated Marxist feminism and was a member of the Communist Party from 1974.  Retirement  Following her retirement from the University of Essex in 1996, McIntosh worked with the Citizens Advice Bureau in Islington, North London. She entered a civil partnership with Angela Stewart-Park in 2005. After suffering a first stroke in 2010, she died at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London on 5 January 2013 after suffering a second stroke. Her remains were cremated at Marylebone cemetery on 18 January. Her archive composed of correspondence, research notes, campaigning materials, journals and ephemera is held by the London School of Economics and Political Science Library.

Early life  Curtis was born on 2 October 1886 in Sunderland. She was the daughter of George Curtis and Annie Johnson. The former worked at the Post Office while his wife was an elementary school teacher. Curtis was educated at Allan's Endowed Girls' School, Newcastle upon Tyne, Winchester High School and Newnham College, Cambridge. After finishing school, she was an editor of the Victoria County History for seven years while also working as a private tutor.  Civil service  Curtis' civil service career began in 1915 when she became part of the temporary staff of the War Trade Intelligence Department. By 1918, she transferred to the Ministry of Food and became the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Establishment Branch from 1920 to 1922. She became a permanent civil servant in 1923 after passing the first competitive examination for super- clerical grade women, in which she placed first. She then held positions in the Ministry of Pensions and the Post Office. Later, she was assumed the Assistant Secretary and Director of Women's Establishments in the Treasury, which was considered the premier women's post in the Civil Service. She retired from government work in 1942, Curtis headed a government committee addressing children care for England and Wales in 1946. This resulted to the so-called Curtis Report, which was described as \\"the first enquiry in this country directed specifically to the care of children deprived of a normal home life\\". It was presented to the Labour government, which replaced the war- time coalition government in 1945. The report led to the enactment of the Children Act of 1948, which mandated that every local authority must set up a children's committee to advance children's interests. Curtis was created a Dame of the British Empire in 1949.  Academic career  Following her retirement from the civil service in 1941, Curtis was elected Principal of Newnham College, taking office in January 1942. She would hold the post until 1954. She enabled the college to carry on in the face of wartime and immediate post-war restrictions, and as a civil servant, worked to improve the efficiency of academic administration. It was a difficult and frustrating process, particularly amid the restrictions of the post-war period. Curtis played an important part in the negotiations on behalf of the women's colleges which resulted in women finally being awarded degrees from the University of Cambridge. In 1952 she was the first woman elected to the council of the Senate at Cambridge, and she chaired the women's appointments board. She also chaired a committee which promoted the establishment of a third women's college to accommodate the growing number of women at Cambridge: the result was New Hall, opened in October 1954, and now Murray Edwards College.

It is described in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 10). Pharmaceutical companies routinely use FDA citizen petitions to delay the entry of generic drugs into the United States marketplace. Companies use this to counter the parts of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act which make generic drugs more available. In 2016 Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America requested various changes to the FDA petition process which the FDA declined. In November 2016 the FDA updated the citizen petition process. Most citizen petitions are filed by drug companies against competing drug companies. Innovator companies may also present arguments to the FDA that the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) should not be accepted by filing a \\"citizen petition\\" with the FDA. Citizen petitions are part of the basic law governing everything the FDA does - at any time, any “interested person” can request that the FDA “issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order,” or “take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action.” Originally there was no deadline by which the FDA had to respond to citizen petitions filed to protest ANDAs, leading to significant delays in approving generics. In 2007 the law was amended to include a new section, Section 505(q), in the part of the federal code created by the Hatch-Waxman Act; this section said that the FDA could not delay approving an ANDA due to concerns raised in a citizen petition unless the delay was \\"necessary to protect public health issues\\"; it also mandated that the FDA needed to respond to a petition within 180 days - this was shorted to 150 days in a 2011 amendment. In 2014 the FDA issued guidance to industry about submitting citizen petitions and how it would consider them.

In 1881 Matlack published Dramatic Sonnets, a collection of verses designed \\"to give expression to every possible form of conflicting thought and feeling\\". In the 1890s, she published comic poems for children in the popular children's magazines Harper's Young People and The St. Nicholas Magazine. The success of these comics led her to publish A New Alice in the Old Wonderland in 1895, which featured illustrations by her daughter Anna Richards Brewster. Mother and daughter collaborated on several publications, including Letter and spirit, dramatic sonnets of inward life, published 1898, and a translation of a German folktale, Sintram and His Companions, published in 1900.

He is a former dean of research and holds the ICMR Dr. C.G. Pandit National Chair at AIIMS. An elected fellow of the International Medical Sciences Academy, The World Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India, Mehra is known for his research on histocompatibility and immunogenetics. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 1992. He received the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit from François Mitterrand in 2003.  Biography  All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi Born on 4 November 1949 in Amritsar, in the Indian state of Punjab, Mehra did his schooling at Bishop Cotton School, Simla and earned his graduate degree (BSc) with human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry as optional subjects from Government Medical College, Amritsar in 1969 before moving to Delhi to complete his master's degree (MSc) in human anatomy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS). He continued at AIIMS for his doctoral studies and after securing a PhD in 1975 on the immunology of leprosy, did post-doctoral work on histocompatibility and immunogenetics at the laboratory of Jon van Rood in the Netherlands and later with John A. Hansen at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. On his return to India, he joined his alma mater, AIIMS, as a pool officer in 1977. In 1979, he was elevated to lecturer with the additional responsibility of the clinical and research activities of the Histocompatibility Laboratory established under the Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year he joined AIIMS. In 1993, the laboratory, which served as the core laboratory in India for workshops on histocompatibility as well as a base for researches on human leukocyte antigen (HLA), was upgraded to a full-fledged department under the name \\"Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics\\", which he headed as its founding chair, in the capacity of a professor and served out his career at AIIMS in that position. He also served as the member secretary of the Research Advisory Council and chaired the Dean's Research Committee (DRC) at AIIMS. At the time of his official retirement from service in 2004, he was serving as the Dean of Research and post-retirement, he holds the Dr. C. G. Pandit National Chair of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at AIIMS, continuing his research at the institution. Mehra resides in AIIMS Campus, in Ansari Nagar, New Delhi.  Legacy  A hand affected by rheumatoid arthritis Mehra, whose research has covered various aspects of histocompatibility and immunogenetics, started his work on the subjects during his post-doctoral days in Europe, and at John Hansen's laboratory in Seattle, where he used DNA-based technologies of HLA analysis to study the immunogenetic aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Later, in India, he studied HLA-linked genes and identified that a subtype of HLA-DR2 carried a unique class II haplotype which made humans susceptible to diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. He also differentiated the Indian rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients from the Western Caucasian patients by demonstrating that the former showed a pattern of HLA-DR and HLA- DQ association and these studies helped in characterizing the Indian population with regard to its genomic diversity. His group demonstrated that HLA genes with specific pockets in the peptide binding region controlled the severity of mycobacterial diseases, which was a first-time discovery. Together with Ajay Kumar Baranwal of AIIMS Delhi and Brian D. Tait of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he carried out a research project, Antibody Repertoire and graft outcome following solid organ transplantation, which assisted in the prediction of graft rejection and had significance in organ and bone marrow transplantation. He also guided a team of scientists in a project based on polymorphic immunomodulatory genes for developing molecular medicine to combat infectious, autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. His research has been published by way of over 450 articles; of which 287 are listed by ResearchGate. Besides, he has published a book, The HLA Complex in Biology and Medicine: A Resource Book, and has contributed chapters to books published by other researchers, including Textbook of Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Allied and Molecular Medicine. His researches have been cited by many authors, too. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi established a Histocompatibility Laboratory under its Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year Mehra joined as a pool officer at the institution. Subsequently, he took over the activities of the laboratory and by the time he was promoted to professor in 1993, the laboratory had developed into a referral centre as well as a core laboratory for histocompatibility workshops and AIIMS elevated its status to an independent department, the Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, with Mehra as its founding chair. Under the aegis of the new department and in association with Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti, he established the first Asian Indian Donor Marrow Registry (AIDMR), a database of the donors of bone marrow in India in 1994. He would later explain the details of the registry through an article, Asian Indian donor marrow registry: All India Institute of Medical Sciences experience, published in Transplantation Proceedings in 2007. He has delivered a number of keynote addresses or invited lectures including MedIndia 2003 2013 seminar of human genomics at the Guru Nanak Dev University, 2016 India-Japan Regulatory Symposium, and a Guest lecture series organized by Manipur University in 2016. He has also mentored around 60 masters and doctoral research scholars in their studies.  Professional associations  Mehra is the founding president of the Federation of Immunological Societies of Asia Oceania (FIMSA) and has served as its vice president thereafter. He was also the organizer of the Advanced Course on Basic and Translational Immunology, conducted by FIMSA in collaboration with the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and Indian Immunology Society (IIS) in March 2012; he has also served as a member of the council of IUIS. He presides over the Indian Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics and was a member of the faculty of the 2016 edition of ISHICON held in December 2016 at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. He sits on the National Board of Advisors of the Center for Stem Cell Science, and the Advisory Board of Indus Foundation and is a trustee of the Board of Immunology Foundation as well as a member of the Publication Advisory Board of the Indian National Science Academy. Mehra sits on the editorial board of HLA (journal) (formerly known as Tissue Antigens) and is a member of the International Advisory Board of Wiley's journal Modern Rheumatology. He has been associated with journals such as Microbes and Infection of Pasteur Institute, Paris, International journal of Human Genetics and Journal of Clinical Immunology of Springer, as a member of their editorial boards. He is a former member of the ELSI Committee of the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics consortium (T1DGC) of the National Institutes of Health and a former vice president of the Indian Society of Organ Transplantation (ISOT). The invited speeches delivered by him include the first scientific meeting of Allergy and Immunology Society of Sri Lanka (ALSSL) and the Braunschweig Streptococcal colloquium. He has also been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of Jalma Institute of Leprosy & Other Mycobacterial Diseases, Task Force on Human Genetics and Human Genome Analysis of Department of Biotechnology and the Task Force on Human Genetics of the Indian Council of Medical Research.  Awards and honors  Mehra received the H. J. Mehta Gold Medal in 1977 and the Shakuntala Amir Chand Prize of the Indian Council of Medical Research in 1983. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1992.

With one exception, the collection of poems were written at sea by Longfellow in October 1842. The poems were reprinted as anti-slavery tracts two different times during 1843. Longfellow, very conscious of his public persona, published the poems even though he feared it would hurt him commercially. At the time of publication reviews were mixed, but more recently critics (now less bothered by what was earlier done away with as mere sentimentality) have begun to appreciate the collection again, for its political message and for its rhetorical strategies.  Contents  *\\"To William E. Channing\\" ::This poem serve as a dedication to the book and is addressed to William Ellery Channing. It is written in common meter with five stanzas. *\\"The Slave's Dream\\" ::This poem speaks about how a slave sees his home land in his memories, where he is a king. *\\"The Good Part\\" ::This poem tells of how a woman gives her life and fortune to the abolition of slavery. *\\"The Slave in the Dismal Swamp\\" ::A poem about a hunted slave hiding in the Great Dismal Swamp while he hears the hounds baying in the distance. It has six stanzas. *\\"The Slave Singing at Midnight\\" ::This poem is about a lonely slave singing from the Psalms of David. *\\"The Witnesses\\" ::This poem is representing a sunken ship of slaves on the bottom of the ocean as a witness to the slave trade. *\\"The Quadroon Girl\\" ::Poem in twelve stanzas, common meter, about a slave owner who, after raping his maid, sells his own daughter, a quadroon girl, to a slaver who takes her as his sexual slave. *\\"The Warning\\" (written before his trip to Europe) ::Longfellow speaks to the United States anticipating the violence to come, and likens the slaves to the Biblical Samson.  Composition and publication  Many factors that helped influence Longfellow to compose Poems on Slavery. As a young man he read Benjamin Lundy's Genius of Universal Emancipation in his father's library. He considered writing a drama on the subject of Toussaint l'Ouverture so \\"that I may do something in my humble way for the great cause of Negro emancipation\\". Charles Sumner wished Longfellow would devise verses on slavery; Sumner wrote to Longfellow encouraging him to \\"write some stirring words that shall move the whole land\\". Longfellow traveled to Europe for six months in 1842 for his health. In October, before he set sail back home from England, he wrote to Charles Sumner from Charles Dickens's study and mentioned that Dickens's new book, American Notes, had a chapter on slavery. Longfellow wrote the poems soon to be collected as Poems on Slavery that month while on the return voyage to the United States, which fulfilled Sumner's request. Of the eight poems, seven were written while Longfellow was confined to his cabin during a fifteen-day storm. He envisioned his poems during the sleepless nights and then wrote them in the morning. When Longfellow returned home he added a poem he had written previously, and published the eight poems in a 30-page pamphlet. The poem \\"The Good Part\\" was deemed inappropriate, without any type of explanation, for reprinting in Longfellow's Poems on Slavery, by the New England Anti-slavery Tract Association in 1843. In January 1843, Longfellow corresponded with Rufus Wilmot Griswold about reviewing his Poems on Slavery in Graham's Magazine. Griswold wrote to Longfellow that George Rex Graham objected to publishing the title of Longfellow's work, and the magazine made no mention of the poems. In December 1843, Elihu Burritt requested Longfellow's permission to print some of his Poems on Slavery as tracts. In 1845, Poems on Slavery was omitted from Longfellow's collected Poems due to his worry that they could ruin sales in the Southern and Western states. = Longfellow's correspondence regarding the poems= Longfellow sent several letters and copies of the poems to friends and family. In a letter to Henry Russell Cleveland in November 1842, Longfellow told of how he had written the poems on his way home and \\"shall not dare to send them to you in Cuba, for fear of having you seized as an Abolitionist\\". In December 1842, Longfellow sent a letter to John Forster with a copy of the poems. Longfellow wanted to see the how society would respond to the poems and wanted to add more later. A letter that Longfellow wrote to William Plumer Jr discussed how he wrote his poems in a kind spirit. Longfellow sent a letter to his father, Stephen Longfellow, in January 1843, discussing how he thought the poems made an impression. He wrote Ferdinand Freiligrath in January 1843 to let him know that he had used one or two of the wild animals from his menagerie for the poem Slaves Dream. Longfellow wrote to George Lunt that he was \\"sorry you find so much to gainsay in my Poems on Slavery\\" and spoke about his beliefs by using an article by William Ware from the Christian Examiner. Longfellow received many letters about his poems and some people even regretted that Longfellow had written them. Longfellow said his feelings prompted him to write about such things and that he had no regrets about writing them. Longfellow refused to speak at antislavery rallies, though John Greenleaf Whittier attempted to get him to run as a candidate for an antislavery party for Congress. Longfellow felt the apparent political nature of the Poems on Slavery was not something he wished to do again.  Reviews  The book received attention due to it being such a controversial topic and Longfellow's notability. Margaret Fuller, editor of The Dial, reviewed Longfellow's poems in her magazine. She called it \\"the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow's thin books; spirited and polished, like its forerunners; but the topic would warrant a deeper tone\\". In 1843 John Forster wrote a lengthy review of slavery and Longfellow's poems in the English magazine The Examiner. Forster said about Longfellow's poems: \\"An excellent feeling predominates throughout them, and much graphic power is displayed in the descriptions. Admirable, and most picturesque is this which follows.\\" In May 1843, Longfellow wrote a review of his Poems on Slavery to Isaac Appleton Jewett in a personal letter. Longfellow spoke of how the poems had favorable reception from people, and how he thought that they were \\"so mild that even a slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite for breakfast\\".  Legacy  Even though Poems on Slavery are considered mild today and lacked widespread recognition, the poems are still in print today along with his other poems. Janet Harris, in 1978, remarked on the courage it must have taken for a man like Longfellow, who took such great interest in the public perception, to publish these controversial poems in 1842, even at the risk of it hurting sales for his other writings. Paul K. Johnston, Professor of English at State University of New York at Plattsburgh, notes that Poems on Slavery, like Uncle Tom's Cabin, is \\"rehabilitated as a political statement on behalf of its marginalized characters\\", and has survived a half-century of formalist literacy in the 20th century that considered his and Stowe's work merely sentimental and didactic. Johnston notes also that some of Longfellow's \\"strategies and images\\" anticipate Stowe's.

Maria E. Beasley (née Kenny; 1847-1904) was an entrepreneur and inventor. She is best known for her barrel- making machines and her improvements to the life raft, and she held fifteen different patents in the United States and two in Great Britain.  Biography  =Personal life= Beasley was born Maria Kenny in 1847https://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=12223. Little is known of her upbringing or education. It is unclear how she was inspired to become an inventor, though some speculate that she was influenced by the Centennial Exhibition (and specifically the Women’s Pavilion) in 1876. She was married to Samuel Beasley in 1865, and ran the household in addition to her business and creative pursuits. Philadelphia directories from 1880-1890 (with one break in 1887) list her as a dressmaker, despite her filing several patents and developing a barrel-making business during that time. Between 1891 and 1896, Chicago directories listed her occupation as inventor. Beasley died in 1904. = Inventions = Beasley's first patent was granted in 1878. She then had invented a barrel-hooping machine, which she showed at the World Industrial and Cotton Exposition in 1884. Beasley's barrel-hooping machine was designed to speed up the manufacturing of barrels, enabling 1,500 to be produced a day. Beasley's barrel-hooping machine made her quite a lot of money, with the Evening Star writing in 1889, that she \\"made a small fortune out of a machine for the manufacture of barrels.\\" Her invention could make 1,500 barrels a day. Beasley's other inventions included foot warmers, cooking pans, anti- derailment devices for trains and two improved life raft designs, which were also patented in Britain.  Barrel-Making Machines  Beginning in 1878, Maria Beasley received a series of eight patents for the barrel-making process. These included six mechanical patents, including two simply labeled barrel-making machines, two for hoop-driving, one for barrel setup, and one for barrel-stave shaping. She displayed a barrel-making machine at the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans in 1884. Her inventions attracted sugar and oil refineries, and royalties from contracts involving the use of her barrel-hooping machine alone amounted to $20,000 annually. Some accounts also suggest that she ran a business of manufacturing barrels herself, in addition to the contracts she had with sugar and oil companies. Life raft design After her success in the barrel-making industry, Beasley sought to create a better life raft that was \\"fire-proof, compact, safe and readily launched.\\" She invented this new design in 1880. Her new design included guard railings surrounding the raft and rectangular metal floats. This design is able to fold and unfold so it is easy to store, even with the rails. Prior to Beasley’s design, life rafts were typically flat, wooden boards. The concepts of guard rails and reduced size for storage remain in use today, although her exact designs have been long outdated.

Joseph is beating chestnuts from a tree. The Rest on the Flight into Egypt is a subject in Christian art showing Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus resting during their flight into Egypt. The Holy Family is normally shown in a landscape.Schiller, 121–122; Hall, 124 The subject did not develop until the second half of the fourteenth century, though it was an \\"obvious step\\" from depictions of the \\"legend of the palm tree\\" where they pause to eat dates and rest; palm trees are often included.Schiller, 121–122; on the miracle itself: 118–119, 121 It was a further elaboration of the long-standing traditions of incidents that embellished the story of the Flight into Egypt, which the New Testament merely says happened, without giving any details.Schiller, 117–122 The earliest known Rest is a panel in the large compartmented Grabow Altarpiece by the north German painter Meister Bertram, from about 1379,Schiller, 122 and the subject was mainly found north of the Alps until 1500 or later. Most depictions are made for wealthy homes rather than churches, and the subject only rarely forms part of cycles of the Life of Christ in churches (though the Grabow Altarpiece is one exception). As landscape painting increased in popularity, it became an alternative to the original scene of the family on the road, and by the late sixteenth century perhaps overtook it in popularity.Schiller, 122; Boston The figures are often simply resting, but sometimes more definite camping or picnicking is shown, perhaps assisted by angels. In earlier pieces the Virgin is sometimes breastfeeding, connecting to the long-standing iconography of the Virgo Lactans.Prado Joseph may be active, gathering firewood or fetching water, but in later pieces he is sometimes fast asleep, which the Virgin rarely is. In larger landscapes, other legendary incidents from the Flight may be seen in the distance.Schiller, 122–123 Background The single New Testament account, in Matthew 2:14, merely says (of Joseph): \\"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt\\".Authorized Version This account was embellished in various early New Testament apocrypha, which added various legendary incidents. Late medieval accounts continued to add detail, in particular the Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony, completed about 1374, just a few years before the time that the first artistic depiction of the Rest is found. This includes a description of Mary breastfeeding, which is found in Meister Bertram's Grabow Altarpiece, the first known painting.Ainsworth, 308 Ludolph also mentions the journey passing \\"through dark and uninhabited forests, and by very long routes past rough and deserted places to Egypt\\",Ainsworth, 308 setting the tone for the great majority of the landscape settings throughout the history of the depiction, though the trees usually clear sufficiently to allow a distant view.David, 249 Hans Memling triptych, 1475–1480, Louvre While the miraculous legends like the miracles of the palm tree, corn, and pagan statue all fell under the disapproval of the Church in the Counter-Reformation, and generally disappear from art, that the Holy Family must have broken their journey for rests was undeniable, so that the subject's legitimacy in scriptural terms was defensible. The subject also suited Counter-Reformation drives to promote down to earth realism into New Testament subjects, and to increase the role of Saint Joseph. It thus increased in popularity as the other accretions to the story reduced.Hall, 124; Boston One of the legends, going back to the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (perhaps 7th-century), was that at the same time as the \\"miracle of the palm-tree\\" on the third day of the journey, a spring miraculously appeared when the travellers needed water, and the Rest is often set beside a spring or stream, though this can be regarded as natural.Hand and Wolff, 64 Christ taking leave of his Mother is another subject with similar origins in late medieval meditational literature. It seems to have been taken up by Passion plays, and does not appear in art before the late 15th century, peaking in the approximate period 1500–1520, mostly in Germany.Hall, 67; Langmuir, Erica, The National Gallery Companion Guide, p. 102, 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, Development of compositions Rest on the Flight by Caravaggio, c.1597, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome The panel in the Grabow Altarpiece emphasises eating and drinking: Jesus is breastfeeding, the donkey drinking from a stream, and Joseph eating (probably bread) while offering Mary a bottle. Although the painting has a gold ground, this is one of the panels where landscape settings are painted around the edges. For about a century after this, depictions remain few. An altarpiece by Hans Memling (Louvre) marks the beginning of a sharp increase in depictions of the scene, and introduces the miracles to the background landscape,Prado though the composition, with a standing Virgin, is unusual. In the decades around 1500 the Virgin and Child often dominate the composition in Early Netherlandish paintings, with Joseph and the donkey in the middle distance, if they are visible at all. In a Gerard David in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, Joseph is seen in the background gathering food by beating a chestnut tree with a long stick, a detail probably borrowed from miniatures of the Labours of the Months in the calendars of books of hours, and perhaps a northern substitute for the dates in the legends.Hand and Wolff, 64–65; Washington page The Washington painting appears to be the earliest in a number of paintings of the subject, or using the central figures in other contexts, that were apparently produced by transfer from copies of drawings. Many of these are loosely attributed to the large Bruges workshop of Adriaen Isenbrandt.David, 279–295 Despite the fact that on the Flight itself Joseph is invariably shown on foot, leading the donkey on which Mary and the child are seated, in Rests,Schiller, 120–121; in the West, \\"variants are exceptions and are unimportant as far as the sense of the image is concerned\\" (p. 121). Joseph is typically still shown standing, if not engaged in some activity. After the High Renaissance he often stands behind the Virgin, giving a pyramidal group of figures when she is flanked by angels. Relatively few depictions show him resting his feet seated next to Mary, or eating. These include an engraving of c. 1506 by Lucas van Leyden,British Museum page and a chiaroscuro drawing by Hans Springinklee of 1514.British Museum page The wider landscape of the Patinir in the Prado allows space for depictions in the distance (at right) of the Massacre of the Innocents which provoked the flight, and the \\"miracle of the corn\\". The falling pagan idols are shown both on the top of the temple at far left (though a statue of a rat-headed god is intact) and by the pair of metal feet on the sphere next to the Virgin. The donkey is grazing some way off, and Joseph seems to have obtained a pot of milk, which he is carrying back.Prado There are a number of versions by Patinir or his circle; other prolific makers of Rests include Jan Brueghel the Elder and Jan Brueghel the Younger and various collaborators, and Simone Cantarini (1612–1648). Part way through painting what would have been an early Italian version of the subject, Giovanni Cariani seems to have changed his mind and added shepherds to create an \\"eccentric\\" composition of the Adoration of the Shepherds (1515-17, Royal Collection).Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque, p. 198, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, Rembrandt's only nightscape, 1647, National Gallery of Ireland Untypical examples with specific activities include the famous Caravaggio, where Joseph holds the sheet music for an angel playing a viol; here both the Virgin and Child have fallen asleep.Schiller, 123 The only piece of detail the gospel gives is that the flight began \\"at night\\", but landscape scenes at night were very rare in art in the first centuries of the subject. In a night scene by Rembrandt (1647, Dublin), the family seem to have joined some herdsmen with a big fire for the night; this is his only night landscape.National Gallery of Ireland page This relates to the painting of the Flight by Adam Elsheimer where they are just arriving at such an improvised encampment; Rembrandt would have known this from a print.Slive, 77, 181 Two other unusual treatments from Dutch Golden Age painting are a realist scene showing the family in more or less contemporary dress in a run-down Dutch tavern or farmhouse by Abraham Bloemaert (1634, Rijksmuseum), and one with Joseph reading from a large book, no doubt religious, by Aert de Gelder (c. 1690, Boston).Boston page The subject is sometimes not easily distinguished from the Holy Family in Egypt, though the presence of the young John the Baptist, and a house nearby, suggest this, as the presence of the traditional ass or donkey suggests a Rest. In any case the \\"rest\\" was sometimes later interpreted to include the entire stay in Egypt, which according to the Golden Legend lasted seven years. A woodcut in Albrecht Dürer's series on the Life of the Virgin is always known as a Rest on the Flight, despite showing Joseph clearly well settled in Egypt, with a large house, and busy working on his carpentry, assisted by angels.Schiller, 123 Philipp Otto Runge, 1805, Kunsthalle Hamburg In the same way, depictions of the Flight which include the miracle of the date palm approach being a Rest, as in the influential engraving by Martin Schongauer (before 1491), where Mary remains sitting on the stationary donkey as Joseph gathers dates.Hutchison, 6; Shestack, #40. It was loosely copied by Albrecht Dürer, and closely by many others. From about 1550 Italian paintings often have infestations of putti- angels, following German examples in prints,Shestack, #117, by Master BM, with four more grown-up singing angels (British Museum page. Another four assist Joseph in the Schongauer just mentioned, #40 and paintings from the first decade of the century by Lucas Cranach the Elder and Albrecht Altdorfer. General trends in landscape painting affect treatments of the subject. Like the Flight, it was popular with Joachim Patinir and his circle, who set the family amid extensive world landscapes. Maryan Ainsworth contrasts this group, centred on the outward-looking international trading-centre of Antwerp, with the paintings dominated by large figures of the Virgin and Child produced by Gerard David and his circle, based in Bruges, a city that had lost commercial pre-eminence and was now turning in on itself.David, 241–253, especially 252 18th-century depictions were often set beside classical ruins, and a few 19th- century ones featured Ancient Egyptian architecture. Some Romantic depictions placed the incident in lush paradisal settings, notably one that is \\"the first successful realization of Philipp Otto Runge's ambition to unite Christian orthodoxy with Romantic mysticism and his own personal cosmology\\",German, 186 or, less appreciatively, one where \\"he seeks to express the working of divine forces in nature in a vague, emotional manner\\".Schiller, 123 Examples  * Rest on the Flight to Egypt with Saint Francis, by Correggio, c.1520, Uffizi, Florence. * The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, by Paris Bordone, c.1530, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c. 1597, by Caravaggio, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, 1630, by Anthony van Dyck, Alte Pinakothek, Munich. * The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, 1640s (?)Metropolitan page oil on copper, by Pier Francesco Mola, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c.1665 , by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.

The episode was written by Angela Kang and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. The episode focuses primarily on Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) accompanying Rosita (Christian Serratos) on a secret mission to assassinate Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in order to avenge their late boyfriend, Abraham Ford. Elsewhere, Simon (Steven Ogg) and the Saviors pay an unexpected visit to the Hilltop with plans of taking more than just supplies. Plot At the Hilltop, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) have begun training survivors, including Enid (Katelyn Nacon), how to use knives offensively in preparation for the imminent war against the Saviors. Surprising everyone, Simon (Steven Ogg) and a crew of Saviors raid the community, forcing Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Maggie to hide in the cellar. Aware of the Saviors' arrival, Sasha packs her bag and takes Rosita (Christian Serratos) to a secret escape hatch that passes beneath the perimeter wall. After sneaking out of the Hilltop, both rebels begin to carry out their secret mission. During the raid, a Savior walks toward the cellar doors. Enid desperately tries to distract him away from the basement, but he proceeds to enter the cellar. As Daryl, held back from Maggie, readies his knife to attack, the Savior searches the cellar, but soon leaves with some supplies and shuts the door. Once he's gone, Maggie remarks to Daryl that he hasn't spoken a word to her ever since he returned to the Hilltop. Crying, Daryl apologizes to Maggie for unintentionally causing Glenn's death. Maggie resolutely maintains Daryl wasn't to blame, saying that Glenn knew Daryl was \\"good\\", and that nearly killing a Savior unnecessarily would only have detracted from the bigger goal — winning the war; they embrace. Eventually, the Saviors leave with Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris) in tow, as their new doctor, so that he can replace his now-deceased brother, Emmett Carson, who was burned alive inside a furnace after being thrown in by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) for a false confession. The Hilltop residents gather at the gates and watch the Saviors leave with Dr. Carson. Gregory (Xander Berkeley), sensing their disappointment, shifts around uncomfortably and continues to lose credibility as a leader. Situating themselves in an empty building near the Sanctuary, Sasha and Rosita set up a sniper's nest. While waiting, they bond over their purpose and past events. At night, Sasha and Rosita attempt to sneak into the Sanctuary, where they encounter Eugene (Josh McDermitt) from the other side of a fence. They urge Eugene to come with them and escape, but he refuses. He tells them to go away and heads back inside the compound; Rosita curses at Eugene, in sincere disappointment. At Sasha's suggestion, Rosita keeps watch as Sasha slips through the fence, but doesn't notice Sasha using a lock to close the opening behind her so that she can lock Rosita out. Despite Rosita's protest, Sasha explains to her that it isn't her \\"time\\" and that Alexandria still needs her. Leaving Rosita behind, Sasha breaks into the Sanctuary, through an open door, to kill Negan herself. Sasha kills another Savior in the process, leaving her fate unknown. As gunfire breaks out, Rosita sobs in frustration and flees when she hears Saviors approaching, but eventually stops to catch her breath and notices a dark figure, holding a crossbow, watching her from a small distance. Production The episode largely focuses on Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Rosita (Christian Serratos). Martin-Green commented on Sasha's sacrifice as symbolic of the themes of the season saying, \\"I think so many of us have realized that the only fight worth fighting is one for the future. Our value of life has expanded beyond concern for ourselves. We're leaders of this world and we're building a future for us, for our children and hopefully our children's children. Regardless of the sacrifice. It's a prevailing theme of the back half of the season and I think it's an astounding truth.\\" She said, \\"Rosita is needed elsewhere. There has to be a point to these sacrifices, as I say to her, and there would be no point for her to join me when this is my path alone to take. It was definitely emotional, but there was joy there too, the joy that comes from reconciliation and the joy that comes from stepping into what you believe is your purpose.\\" Serratos mentioned the bonding scene between Rosita and Sasha was the most dialogue she ever had on the show. On Rosita's backstory, she commented, \\"She knew that what she had to offer was her appearance and that it could benefit her if she chose to utilize it, and that’s what she did to survive. And I thought that was just really cool, and the fact that she was doing it 10 times better than all these dudes is a really cool message.\\" The episode also features the re-appearance of Maggie (Lauren Cohan), who has been absent for four consecutive episodes and was last seen briefly in \\"Rock in the Road.\\" This episode also is the first to address the sexual orientation of Jesus. Actor Tom Payne promised “he is the same as he is the comic books in that regard,” and later said, “I was excited to first establish Jesus as a kick-ass ninja, then have the fact that he happens to be gay dropped in later. The way it’s done is subtle. It’s a small moment.” Reception =Critical reception= The scenes involving Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) (pictured) were noted as highlights, but most critics felt Sasha's decision to sacrifice herself to save Rosita (Christian Serratos) was manufactured. \\"The Other Side\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 69% with an average rating of 6.0 out of 10, based on 29 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The Other Side\\" delves into the sorrowful aftermath of losing key characters with a slow-building narrative that gathers speed—and gains power—along the way. Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain appreciated the focus on Sasha and Maggie, despite it being more of a \\"Sasha and Rosita\\" episode. He was critical of the decision to go with Rosita's plan rather than Sasha's plan \\"to use the sniper rifle to actually, you know, snipe Negan from a distance\\" rather than Rosita's insistence to \\"go inside the gate. Because I guess you need a sniper rifle for close quarters combat.\\" Kain was critical of Sasha's decision to save Rosita saying, \\"If the show had really explained that Rosita was this awesome, essential part of group, I'd be more inclined to agree with Sasha's decision. As it stands, Sasha seems just as integral to the group as Rosita. It makes as little sense as Sasha agreeing to Rosita's plan in the first place, when the sniper plan is so much better. And it just plain sucks that the better character is waltzing off to certain death, while one of the show's worst characters (at least lately) is safe.\\" He appreciated that Eugene turned out to be \\"the True Coward\\" rather than \\"a wolf in sheep's clothing.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Romano gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade. He felt the moment where Sasha sacrificed herself and told Rosita to flee was a bit \\"forced\\" and felt that, \\"By all accounts, she seemed like she wanted to live.\\" He liked the bonding scene between Sasha and Rosita, and felt that, \\"A moment like this was needed for Rosita, who’s been frustrating to watch for some time as she makes reckless decision after reckless decision.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade. He commented that the episode \\"manages something I thought was nearly impossible at this point: it made me care about Rosita and Sasha’s friendship. Rosita’s become something of a drag of late, as her rage and self-loathing have made her tediously one note. Her interactions with Sasha, in which she never bothers to hide her resentment over Abraham, have been the worst of it. Sasha is less irritating, but she hasn’t had a lot to do other than mourn and plot revenge against Negan. Thankfully, by the end of this episode, both women felt a little closer to actual people again. It’s a simple trick—they bond over attempted murder and a list of Rosita’s ex-boyfriends—but an effective one.\\" However, he was critical of the timing it took to get to the emotional payoff of the episode. He praised Eugene's allegiance to Negan and its pay off, as well as Sasha's decision to leave Rosita behind, calling it a \\"nice twist\\" with \\"horrible, horrible consequences\\". Metros Adam Starkey praised the episode, calling it \\"an effectively emotional build with some standout performances\\", enjoying the comfort moments between Sasha and Rosita. Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent praised the episode. He said \\"what makes this episode work on a wavelength most episodes this season have failed to is through the weaving in of the very plot points the writers have taken time to flesh out; viewer’s patience continues to be rewarded. Take, for instance, both Sasha and Rosita - they’re both seeking to avenge the death of the man they both loved and, while this has made them more adversary than ally previously, we see them learn to find respect for each other with inevitable death approaching (more on that below).\\" He praised the scene between Daryl and Maggie, complimenting Reedus and Cohan's performances. Stolworthy also noted the impact of Sasha's decision to face Negan alone. He said, \\"In a series where the moustachioed soldier's death was - somewhat understandably - overshadowed by original character Glenn (Steven Yeun), this moment feels like the Abe tribute he's deserved for some time now.\\" Jeff Stone of IndieWire gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade. He felt that the episode was \\"an excuse to give Rosita some semblance of character development, something she’s been sorely lacking over her four seasons on the show. It’s also mostly set-up for a cliffhanger to lead us into the final two episodes. It’s serviceable on both counts.\\" He also questioned Sasha's actions, believing it to be \\"manufactured and under-motivated (like Morgan’s turn last episode), since Sasha never seemed to have much of a martyr complex, and her major character beat in the series so far was finding a way back from the brink after she became suicidal back in Season 5.\\" Noam Cohen of New York Observer was more negative of the episode, saying, \\"When it decides to slow down to give us character-centric vignettes, rather than letting their personalities and emotions emerge from their involvement in the plot, it starts to lag, and feel like a lot like filler.\\" =Ratings= The episode received a 4.7 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 10.32 million total viewers.

The episode was written by Corey Reed and directed by Michael Slovis. The episode focuses on Tara (Alanna Masterson) leading Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and a group of Alexandrians to Oceanside, after failing to keep her promise to Cyndie (Sydney Park), in order to retrieve guns so they can fight the Saviors. Meanwhile, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) is questioned by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and must make a heartbreaking decision. Plot Tara (Alanna Masterson) informs Rick (Andrew Lincoln) about the existence and arsenal of the Oceanside. He, Tara, and a small group set off to claim the weapons. While Rick and the others wait at the outskirts, planting an explosive to distract the Oceanside survivors, Tara sneaks into the community to face their leader, Natania (Deborah May), and to convince her to join in Rick's plan. Natania refuses, but when Rick's explosives goes off, Natania gains Tara's gun and holds her in check. As the other Oceanside residents come to check the explosion, Rick's group holds them at gunpoint, explaining his plan to face the Saviors. Natania emerges with Tara, refusing to join them, but just then, a horde of walkers drawn by the blast appear. In the confusion, Cyndie (Sydney Park) subdues Natania with a punch to the face, freeing Tara from gunpoint. Rick efficiently leads both communities into quelling the horde, and Natania angrily concedes to Rick. Rick's group leaves with Oceanside's weapons and some of its survivors willing to help in the fight. At Hilltop, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) continues to take a strong leadership position, which Gregory (Xander Berkeley), its current leader, resents. When Maggie leaves the community to dig up a blueberry bush, Gregory follows her, and apologizes for his behavior towards her. He draws a knife to guard her while she digs up the bush, and contemplates using it on her. However, when walkers appear, he is unable to take action, and Maggie saves his life in time. At the Sanctuary, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) has been captured and placed in a cell. A Savior, David (Martinez), attempts to rape her, but Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) arrives just in time to stop the act and reminds David that rape is forbidden before killing him with a knife. Impressed with Sasha's bravery for attacking Sanctuary, Negan offers her his personal knife and gives her three options for it: kill him, commit suicide, or put down David's corpse before he re-animates as to join them as a Savior. After Negan leaves, Sasha is visited by Eugene (Josh McDermitt) who suggests she join the Saviors like he did, as they make him feel safe. Sasha decides to put down David, and when Negan next returns, tells him that he won before returning the knife. Negan informs her that he heard that Rick's group is up to no good and tomorrow will be a \\"big day\\". Distraught, Sasha pleads with Eugene to bring her a weapon, ostensibly so she can end her life. He brings her one of the poison capsules he previously made, leaving her disappointed. When Rick and the others return from Oceanside, Rosita (Christian Serratos) informs them they have a visitor: Dwight (Austin Amelio), one of Negan's former right-hand men. Daryl (Norman Reedus) attempts to attack him but Rick and the others hold him back, as Dwight begs that he wants to help them. Reception =Critical reception= Sonequa Martin-Green received praise for her performance as Sasha in this episode. \\"Something They Need\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 70% with an average rating of 6.34 out of 10, based on 33 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Something They Need\\" overcomes an uneven arc with humor, an upbeat pace, and a classic Walking Dead cliffhanger. Jeff Stone for IndieWire gave it a C+ moderately positive review, but felt it was mostly \\"perfunctory\\". He felt Sasha's storyline \\"is the only one with any current intrigue, and that’s mostly a coin flip to see if she’ll live.\\" He also assessed that, \\"At least Sasha didn’t kill herself (yet) which would be a pretty depressing anti-climax.\\" The Independents Jacob Stolworthy was complimentary of the old-fashioned walker set-piece. He was disappointed with the show's decision not to show Sasha's infiltration and capture in the Sanctuary, and cutting to the aftermath (spoiled by the promotional stills of the following week). He also felt Sasha's death was inevitable and said, \\"...it's unfortunate then that, in one of the episode's most misjudged moments Sasha's big reveal is merely heard in favour of being shown from the viewpoint of Eugene who is listening outside the door. - something of a head-scratcher.\\" Josh Jackson noted the return of Tara in a central role as positive. He said, \\"...while Alanna Masterson hasn’t been the greatest actress to grace the zombie apocalypse, I can appreciate the everywoman-ness of our bumbling hero.\\" Shane Ryan felt he was \\"burned out\\" with the show. He was complimentary of the action at Oceanside, but levelled some criticisms. He assessed, \\"The plotting of it was bad, the execution was a little strange, but it was still fun because it stuck to the rules of what makes TWD good, on those rare occasions when it actually is.\\" Noel Murray for Rolling Stone was complimentary of the episode's table-setting. He said, \\"About two-thirds of the episode consists of the kind of long, dialectical scenes this show relies on far too often, as a way of killing time instead of walkers and creating the illusion of thematic depth. But here, these pieces serve more of a narrative purpose. And because they're divided across two locations, and broken up by some actually thrilling sequences elsewhere, the overall experience is more satisfying.\\" Sonequa Martin-Green's performance was praised. Josh Jackson felt unlike Masterson, \\"Sonequa Martin-Green, on the other hand, did a great job. I love the way she responded when Negan’s asked if Rick had put her up to the assassination attempt: “Rick? Your bitch? No.”\\" Noel Murray for Rolling Stone said, \\"The often-underutilized and soon-to-be-Trekkie-fan-favorite Sonequa Martin-Green has been taking full advantage of her increased screen-time over the past two weeks; she does some of her best TWD work to date when Sasha – who didn't die in her suicide raid – sits locked in a Sanctuary cell, pondering her next move.\\" He went further on the Sasha storyline saying, \\"What's so remarkable about these interactions are the layers of emotions and motivations that Sasha cycles through, from fear and despair to a sense of hope when she realizes she can manipulate the mulleted gent into slipping her a weapon to \\"kill herself\\" – which she hopes to use on the big man in charge.\\" Blair Marnell for CraveOnline felt that while it was likely it would be her final appearances on the show, they \\"have also been a gift to Martin-Green, as she’s never been more important to the series than she is now. In last week’s episode, Sasha had the really terrific bonding scene with Rosita. This week, Martin-Green carried most of her scenes with Negan and Eugene. She brought the life and fire to this episode, and the series will be poorer for her absence… whenever it eventually comes. Some critics felt the characterization of the core group of survivors was off. Ron Hagan for Den of Geek! said, \\"Rick and Tara finally discuss the presence of the Seaside Motel group, and that means he's ready to go wage a full-fledged assault on a group of women and children, blowing up dynamite outside their walls, drawing the attention of zombies in the area, and then taking all their guns away to fight his own battle. And yes, that's the hero of the story.\\" He was relieved that the cliffhanger involving Sasha in the previous week was not stretched out to the finale. Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club had a similar perspective on raiding Oceanside and gave the episode a C+ grade. He said, \\"The fact that Tara not only signed off on this plan, but also seems to be one hundred percent behind it, is at odds with everything we know about her. However much she’s supposed to believe in Rick now (and clearly, she’s supposed to believe in him a lot), for her to willingly go in on such an openly aggressive scheme is bizarre. This isn’t “we’re going to talk, and see what happens next.” This is “well, I have this hammer, so I guess this has to be another nail!”\\" Handlen overall assessed, \\"...we are forcibly reminded of The Walking Dead’s greatest weakness: Rick Must Always Be Right (except when he’s trying to fight against his destiny as a leader). The people of Oceanside almost immediately lose what little distinctive identity they once had, falling in line like they were just waiting for some bearded dude to show up and start ordering them around, and there’s no acknowledgement of the weirdness of this, of how close Rick’s tactics are to the very man he’s trying to destroy\\". =Ratings= The episode received a 4.9 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 10.54 million total viewers.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple, Angela Kang and Matthew Negrete, and directed by Greg Nicotero. In the episode, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) comes to terms with the decision to commit suicide while in captivity in order to kill Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) reanimated. Brief flashbacks show her short-term relationship with Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and her friendship with Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as a reason to sacrifice herself to protect her friends. Further storylines include the start of the build-up to the All Out War arc with the various aligning survivor communities facing off against Negan and the Saviors. This episode marked Sonequa Martin-Green's final regular appearance in the series as Sasha Williams. Cudlitz reprised his role as Abraham in flashbacks. Khary Payton, Steven Ogg, Katelyn Nacon and Pollyanna McIntosh reappeared as guest stars, before being upgraded to series regulars for the eighth season. This episode was also dedicated in memory of American comic artist Bernie Wrightson, who died on March 18, 2017. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot At Alexandria, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies question Dwight (Austin Amelio), who warns them that Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has captured Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and is preparing a major attack. Dwight offers to help stall them, while Rick sends word to Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) and the Scavengers that their help is needed. At the Sanctuary, Sasha convinces Negan to kill only one Alexandrian instead of three for their transgressions, and agrees to help in his plan. Negan has Sasha secured in a casket on a truck as the rest of the Saviors prepare to march. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) provides Sasha with an iPod and some water before the casket is closed. During the trip, Sasha struggles to maintain consciousness, and has daydreams of Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan). The Saviors encounter a roadblock setup by Dwight, giving time for the Alexandrians and Scavengers to take defensive positions. Negan taunts them, and at his word, Jadis and the Scavengers turn their weapons on the Alexandrians, revealing the Saviors offered them a better deal. Negan orders Sasha's casket brought forward, offering Rick that he will let Sasha live if Alexandria surrenders and turns over all its possessions. Rick demands to see Sasha, and Negan goes ahead to open the casket. A flashback shows Sasha took the suicide pill Eugene had given her the day before after the casket was closed. Now a walker, Sasha attacks Negan, and the distraction allows the Alexanderians to fight against the Saviors and Scavengers, however, they are still outnumbered. As Negan prepares to kill Carl in front of Rick, the combined forces of the Kingdom and Hilltop led by King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and Maggie arrive and fend off the Saviors and Scavengers. Negan is furious to see Maggie still alive. Rick races to find Michonne (Danai Gurira) still alive having battled a Savior to death. When the Saviors regroup at Sanctuary, Negan asks Eugene how Sasha could have died, and he suggests she may have died from suffocation in the casket. Negan remains doubtful but accepts the answer, and tells the Saviors to prepare for war. At Alexandria, the combined group mourn their losses including Sasha's sacrifice. Daryl (Norman Reedus) finds a note from Dwight that he was unaware of the Scavengers' betrayal. Rick, Maggie, and Ezekiel agree to combine their forces in war against the Saviors. Production Sonequa Martin-Green made her final regular appearance as Sasha Williams in this episode The finale marks Sonequa Martin-Green's final regular appearance as Sasha Williams, having been on the show since the season three episode \\"Made to Suffer.\\" The death is a remix of the character Holly from the comic book, however there are some significant differences. Scott M. Gimple stated on Talking Dead that “It was always about Sasha not being a victim. She had wanted a weapon from Eugene. She wanted a knife. She didn’t get one, so she became the knife.” Martin-Green explained Sasha's decision to sacrifice herself and felt that it was “right and complete”. She said, “It was quite poetic [...] it was the perfect end to my story, the perfect culmination of my life. I felt like all of my roads had led to that moment of getting to that place of complete selflessness. Also, it was beautiful because the way I saw it, that warrior spirit lives on. That even in death, I was still going to fight, because I had realized my purpose. It had been revealed to me. Everything before that had been self-preservation, self-defense mechanisms, basically self-obsession. And over the course of my life as Sasha, it was progressing beyond that to the point that I said, ‘O.K., I now have a greater purpose that is much bigger than me, that’s for the future, and I’m going to do it even in death.’” Michael Cudlitz appears in a cameo in this episode in a flashback sequence Speculation had arisen over Martin-Green leaving the show to play the role of Michael Burnham on Star Trek: Discovery. However, she dismissed these claims and said, \\"...what was happening on Walking Dead was already underway. It was the path. It was definitely in place. And then as we were going into the very end of the season, the very end of our shoot for the season - that's when the opportunity for Star Trek came. And so I know some people might think that I left Walking Dead to do Star Trek, but it did not happen that way. It was after Walking Dead was already ending that the opportunity for Star Trek came.\\" Martin-Green said she was aware of the death of Sasha for a while, though was unaware of the details \\"until a few weeks before\\". She said, \\"I didn't know it would be the suicide pill and the Negan of it all. What Scott did tell me is that it would be heroic and sacrificial and that it would be perfect end to the story. He'd thought about it for a long time and had a vision of it for a very long time.\\" Although Tyreese is not mentioned, Sasha's death serves as a parallel to her brother's death scene in the fifth season episode \\"What Happened and What's Going On\\". Both episodes begin with a flashforward of the deaths (although this is not known until the end of the episode) and feature re-appearances of dead characters, as well as the episode titles referencing time. Reception =Critical reception= \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 83% with an average rating of 7.5 out of 10, based on 40 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\" overcomes sporadic doldrums with an action-packed battle sequence, satisfying and innovative storytelling, and impressively imaginative use of a tiger. Jeff Stone of IndieWire gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and summarized it saying, \\"The Season 7 finale is poorly paced, but has enough thrills to get by.\\" Stone appreciated that Sasha \\"went out fighting in her own way\\" but was highly critical of Negan saying, \\"Negan proves he’s still the dumbest villain of all time, because even after all that, he refuses to kill Rick.\\" He criticized Maggie's ending speech and called it \\"repetitive and sappy\\". Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush gave the episode a positive review saying, \\"It’s a strong finish to an otherwise uneven season that already alienated many viewers with its premiere, and I appreciate the level of artistry on display in smaller moments like the callback to Sasha and Maggie watching the sunset, or that closing montage. The Walking Dead could use more episodes operating on this frequency, and I suspect there’s lessons to be learned here. Blair Marnell of CraveOnline felt the episode \\"gave Sasha a memorable send off…and then it just kept on giving it to her. The intercutting between Sasha’s dream reunion with Abe, her time with Negan and Eugene, and her final moments in the coffin was an interesting way to chronicle the last hours of her life. But it went on for far too long.\\" Overall, she noted the slow pacing and filler episodes of the season and felt \\"it robbed the series of its urgency\\". On the upcoming war, she assessed, \\"In theory, the “All Out War” storyline could and should be more intense, but this show's recent history suggests that its approach isn't going to change. Eventually, the audience's willingness to put up with the sluggish pace will catch up with this series. Given the declining ratings, it's possible that it's already started to happen. The Walking Dead has pulled off some amazing feats over the last seven seasons, but even this show can't last forever.\\" Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian called it \\"a satisfyingly gaudy ending, with mobile caskets, shots to the gut and the return of Shiva the almighty CGI tiger.\\" Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant felt the episode was \\"a drag\\" but assessed that Sasha's death served as the episode's highlight. He went further saying, \\"Her plan, to become a spring-loaded zombie in Negan’s coffin [...] worked like a charm and the episode’s technique of filling the frame with Sonequa Martin-Green’s face while she listened to some Donny Hathaway and reminisced about Abraham set the tone for her departure and suggested that even with the loss everything would be okay. Surprisingly, that’s where ‘The First Day of the Rest of Your Life’ excelled. At making one character's death feel like it meant something after so many of them have increasingly felt like distractions from a go-nowhere plot. In the end, Sasha's death also provided a necessary distraction, one that let Rick and his crew turn the tables on the duplicitous Jadis and her junkyard kids, and finally push back against the bully in the schoolyard. It's just too bad the rest of the hour wasn't as effective as losing Sasha.\\" Elise Nakhnikian of Slant Magazine was critical of the ending but praised Sasha's scenes. She assessed the ending as a whole, \\"...it was disappointing when the season ended with another inconclusive skirmish between the Saviors and Alexandrians. True, this latest attempt at rebellion was a different order of magnitude than any of their earlier clashes: a de facto declaration of war. But it was so badly botched that it did little to change the balance of power, functioning mainly as a prolonged teaser for the battle that will follow (if the TV gods have any mercy) in season eight.\\" Nakhnikian felt Sasha's subplot gave the \\"most emotionally engaging moments, as it did in “Something They Need.” She assessed that, \\"The irony of her entering a casket so fully alive and coming out of it (un)dead is poignant, and the initial challenge of figuring out what's happening in her scenes is intriguing, as close-ups of her sorrowful face in the dark give way to flashbacks to her conversation with Abraham and occasional shots of her sitting quietly on a bench next to Maggie. Unlike Maggie's final voiceover about the power of the community Rick's group has established, which tells us nothing we don't already know in language too pedestrian to stir any emotion, Sasha's story resonates, letting us mourn the loss of a character whose best epitaph is delivered by Negan: “You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddam fool.” =Ratings= The episode received a 5.4 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 11.31 million total viewers. It is the show's lowest-rated season finale since season two.

The Convento de San Pedro Mártir, is a convent located in Toledo (Castile-La Mancha, Spain). The Dominican convent was moved in 1407 from its location outside the walls to the houses donated by Doña Guiomar de Meneses. through its successive extensions and modifications, became one of the richest and most important convents of the city. The convent, of enormous dimensions, is organized around three courtyards: The one closest to the entrance is denominated \\"Real\\"; The smallest is called the \\"Silencio\\", and the one of the \\"Naranjos\\" or the \\"Procesiones\\" is located on the side of the epistle of the church.  History and description  Garcilaso de la Vega The cloister called \\"Silencio\\" is the oldest of all and possibly corresponds to a civil construction that was later encompassed in the convent. It has three floors. The low with semicircular arches that rest on columns. Pointed arches appear in the north stretch. Columns and capitals of marble, of great bill, pointed to an Italian origin. The second floor is formed by recessed arches that lean on columns very similar to the lower ones. The cloister of the \\"Silencio\\" contrasts with the \\"Real\\", of much greater size, that began to build with traces of Covarrubias, in 1541, by his disciple Hernán González de Lara. It consists of three floors entirely built of stone. The low floor is composed of semicircular arches that rest on columns. The architectural elements used- slate mirrors in the wainscots, balusters, etc., are the usual in Covarrubias in other works of the moment. Of these same dates is the door that gives access to the convent from the street of San Pedro Mártir, that formerly was the main entrance. The cloister of the \\"Naranjos\\", also called the \\"Procesiones\\", underwent a complete transformation in the middle of the 18th century and has reached us with a first floor of arches recessed on columns. Nicolás de Vergara el Mozo was in charge of carrying out the works of the new church and the sacristy. This one began to be constructed in 1587 and it is composed of two spaces: The greater, rectangular, is the one that really serves as sacristy, and another, square, houses a small chapel. The walls of the two spaces are formed by arches with niches, which achieves a greater unity between both. Among the arches are erected Doric pilasters with their corresponding entablature running, which also serves as an element of union between the two spaces. The larger space is covered with a flat, fluted and lunished vaulted ceiling. The most direct access from the church to the sacristy is through a door located at one end of the major side. There is the chapel of Santa Inés, whose Gothic architecture, with vaulted edges, contains several interesting sepulchers. The works of the present church began in 1605 with traces and conditions of Nicolás de Vergara el Mozo. Two years later, Vergara died, Juan Bautista Monegro took over the work. Its plant is of three naves, with choir in high and flat presbytery, with two side chapels. The naves are separated by three arches with Doric pilasters that support the entablature, on top of which a barrel vault rises. A beautiful fence of beginnings of the 17th century separates the presbytery from the croisser. The exterior door of the church, Monegro's work, highlights the magnificent Mudéjar tower of the neighboring church of San Román. Treated in stone, it contrasts not only with the tower but also with the masonry wall of the church proper. The design of the cover reveals the activity of Monegro as a retablist and his relations with Herrerian architecture. The main theme is the triumphal arch that develops in his lower body. The upper one is formed by a small temple, with the sculpture of the titular saint on a basement running. On top of this, two pyramids are also raised with a ball. In the upper part of the facade there are two windows of very simple trace that serve to illuminate the entrance hall.  Headquarters  In the years 1992-1993 important works of remodeling and integration of the convent were realized within the new structures of the University of Castilla-La Mancha, exposing parts of the subsoil of the primitive constructions. it has been operating as the university headquarters of the Faculty of Juridical and Social Sciences of Toledo.

Archdale was the Sheffield branch organiser for the Women's Social and Political Union and later its prisoners' secretary in London. Active during the First World War, Archdale initiated a training farm for women agricultural workers in 1914. In 1917 she served as a clerical worker with Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps, transferring in 1918 to the women's department of the Ministry of National Service.  Biography  Archdale was born at Nenthorn, Berwickshire to Helen Evans (née Carter) (1834–1903), one of the Edinburgh Seven, the first group of women to enroll at a British university, and Alexander Russel (1814–1876), a Scottish journalist and editor of The Scotsman. Archdale was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews, then at the University of St Andrews (1893–1894), where she was one of the first women undergraduates. In 1901 she married Captain Theodore Montgomery Archdale who was stationed in India. Not much is known of her time in India. On returning to Scotland in 1908, she immediately joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), becoming its Sheffield branch organiser in 1910, employed Adele Pankhurst as live-in governess and in 1911 moving to London and taking up the position of prisoners' secretary. Archdale also worked as a writer and journalist. She worked in various capacities on the WSPU's publications The Suffragette from October 1912, and from 1915 she wrote for its successor, Britannia. She was the first editor of the political and literary weekly review Time & Tide (with the unspoken subtext 'wait for no man'), founded in 1920 by Margaret Rhondda. In the 1930s she contributed articles to The Times, Daily News, Christian Science Monitor, and The Scotsman. During the First World War, she was active in multiple positions, including at the Women's Department of the Ministry of National Service in the last year of the war. She started a training farm for women agricultural workers, served as a clerical worker with Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps from 1917, and in 1918 worked in the women's department of the Ministry of National Service.  Political life  Meeting of Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) leaders, Flora Drummond, Christabel Pankhurst, Annie Kenny, Emmeline Pankhurst, Charlotte Despard with two others. 1906 – 1907 Archdale took part in a WSPU demonstration in Edinburgh on 9 October 1909. Later that month she was arrested with Hannah Mitchell, Adela PankhurstPankhurst, Spartacus, 9 March 2017 and Maud Joachim and Catherine Corbett in Dundee. They were convicted of breach of the peace after interrupting a meeting being held by the local MP, Winston Churchill, at which women had been excluded. Following their arrest, on 20 October, all went on hunger strike and were released after four days of the ten days imprisonment. The prison governor and medical supervisor assessed that due to her 'configuration' Archdale 'would be particularly difficult to feed forcibly'. In December 1911 Archdale received a sentence of two months' imprisonment for window-breaking at Whitehall. Her daughter, Betty Archdale (1907-2000), remembered collecting stones for her mother to use, and visiting her in Holloway Prison. Archdale was the secretary, and later international secretary, of the Six Point Group, founded by Margaret Rhondda. The group's six aims were: In 1926 Archdale and Rhondda founded the Open Door Council with Chrystal Macmillan and Elizabeth Abbott. The Open Door Council was created to promote equal economic opportunities for women with a focus on economic emancipation. It opposed the extension of protective legislation for women, regarding such legislation as restrictive, and arguing that it effectively barred women from better-paid jobs such as mining. Archdale was also active in the international version, Open Door International, founded in 1929 with Chrystal Macmillan serving as president. In 1927 Archdale began working in Geneva, lobbying for an Equal Rights Treaty at the League of Nations in the early 1930s. The League was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. She became secretary of the Liaison Committee of Women's International Organisations, created in 1931 as a coalition to promote equal rights, disarmament and women's representation at the League. From 1929 to 1934 she worked to chair Equal Rights International, founded at The Hague, an organisation dedicated to promoting campaigning for equality of women with men in law and in the workplace. In the late 1930s she was associated with the World Women's Party.  Personal life  On 9 October 1901 Archdale married Captain, later Lieutenant-Colonel, Theodore Montgomery Archdale (1875–1918), who at the time was stationed in India. She spent her early married life in Lancashire and India. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Archdale appears to have been estranged from her husband from about 1913. According to her biographer, David Doughan, she had a relationship with Lady Margaret Rhondda: \\"By the early 1920s, she was sharing an apartment, and, together with her family, a country house (Stonepits, Kent) with Lady Rhondda\\".

The bill would also have reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through 2019. The bill passed the House House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee but died before reaching a full House floor vote. Because bills do not carry over into the next Congress, Shuster reintroduced an updated version of the bill in the 115th Congress on June 22, 2017. The subsequent bill is H.R. 2997, the 21st Century Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act.\\"H.R.2997 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): 21st Century AIRR Act\\". Congress.gov. Published by the Library of Congress. Retrieved 2017-08-24. his bill also has never reached a floor vote. In the spring of 2016, the Senate passed and the President signed into law a separate piece of legislation which was a short term reauthorization of the FAA. This reauthorization expires in September 2017. In 2017, House and Senate Transportation Committees began to hold hearings on the status of the airline sector (such as infrastructure and safety) in pursuit of a multi-year authorization. A priority for long-term authorization from House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Shuster is the privatization of air traffic controllers. In the short-term reauthorization passed in 2016, the privatization component—a major component of Shuster's H.R. 4441—was not included.  Background  In the United States, the aviation industry helps drive the national economy. The industry employee millions of people and accounts for over 5% of GDP. The American aviation system is the busiest in the world and continues growing. With the size and scope of the American aviation system, the air traffic control system \\"still utilizes World War II-era radar technology.” According to the House Transportation Committee, “We have an antiquated, inefficient air traffic control system. Bureaucracy hinders our manufacturers’ ability to compete and threatens to drive jobs in new technologies – like drones – overseas. And Americans are growing weary of delays and hassles associated with flying.”\\"21st Century AIRR Act packet\\" . U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Retrieved 2017-08-24. = Air traffic control system reform = The United States’ Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is a division of the Federal Aviation Administration and a unit of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The ATO is the operational arm of the FAA responsible for safe and efficient air navigation. It oversees 17 percent of the world's airspace: the entire United States plus large parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The idea to spin off air traffic control from a government agency to an independent, non-governmental body is modeled after Canada's reforms from two decades ago. Under the reform model, a board of stakeholders would oversee the body and would charge user fees instead of aviation taxes. Canada's system is regarded as one of the most efficient and advanced air navigation service providers in the world. Air traffic control costs 26 percent more in the United States than it does in Canada. The FAA's “NextGen” program is replacing aging equipment. ATC reform would replace the actual system, how it is organized, and who oversees it. An Inspector General report released in January 2017 restarted the debate over moving ATC from FAA to a private corporation governed by the airline industry. Congress must renew the short-term FAA authorization that expires on September 30, 2017, and this issue will be part of the debate. Several events in the past have highlighted need for reform. For example, in September 2014 arson brought down a regional facility in Chicago, which disrupted airline flights for several weeks. In October 2015 the radar room in the tower at Austin- Bergstrom airport flooded. According to UPI, “The Federal Aviation Administration has long maintained control over air traffic control at the nation's airports due to the sensitive nature of the work and the government's desire to prevent private airlines from competing for space, potentially complicating travel time and creating a safety hazard.” In February 2017, the Eno Center for Transportation released the report Time for Reform: Delivering Modern Air Traffic Control. The report recommends moving ATC from FAA to either a government corporation or an independent nonprofit organization. The report also proposes changing the funding structure to user fees rather than mix of taxes and general Treasury funds. According to the Eno Center, “The report finds that spinning-off air traffic control would create a more stable system that the current one, which is subject to political uncertainty. A separate system would not depend on annual budget appropriations, nor subject to budget sequesters and government shutdowns. In the long run this will make running ATC cheaper, providing benefits for the economy and the travelling public.” = History and opposition = The air traffic control program is \\"an issue with enormous economic consequences that impacts every American regardless of how often they fly.\\" The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is a Washington-based organization lobbies on behalf of the interests of private and corporate jet owners. Drew Johnson, a senior fellow at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, wrote in an opinion editorial in the Huffington Post that the NBAA \\"is the reason why the nation’s air traffic control system is so antiquated and incapable of keeping pace with the modern demands of air travel that it accounts for nearly half of all flight delays.\\" In 1993, President Bill Clinton was the first to suggest major reform of the ATC system. He recommended the creation of an independent entity to manage the nation's ATC system. To date, major editorial boards (including the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post) have endorsed the idea. President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee have all publicly supported it, as well. Additionally, \\"Former Secretaries of Transportation and FAA leaders from the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administration – including all three former heads of the U.S. air traffic control system – support ATC reform,” according to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \\"Even though there are far more general aviation aircraft, including corporate and private jet, than commercial planes using America’s airways, corporate jet owners pay only about 1 percent into the ATC system.\\"  Legislative details  = Privatization of FAA activities and air traffic control = The AIRR Act would remove air traffic control from the federal government and place it into a “federally- chartered, not-for-profit corporation called the ATC Corporation” on October 1, 2019. This move would transfer all operational control over air traffic services from FAA to the new corporation. FAA employees, property, and facilities would be transferred to ATC, as well as operational control of FAA air traffic services. When Congressman Shuster announced the introduction of the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act, he said that the ATC system is incredibly inefficient and will just get worse as the number of people flying goes up and the FAA falls further behind in modernization. = Other provisions = In addition to privatizing ATC, the bill has a number of other provisions: * It keeps the FAA's role as the country's main aviation safety regulator. * It creates:  A Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)  An FAA Task Force on Flight Standards Reform  A Regional Consistency Communications Board  A Designated Agency Safety and Health Officer within DOT  An Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration Office within the FAA  A UAS detection systems pilot program * It directs:  The FAA to create a safety workforce training strategy  The DOT to take actions to “promote U.S. aerospace standards, products, and services abroad”  The DOT to create a plan to quicken the pace of integrating civil drones into the national airspace system  The FAA to submit to Congress a strategic cybersecurity plan * It reauthorizes the essential air service program and small community air service development program for fiscal years 2016 to 2022.  Cosponsors  In addition to the original cosponsor (Frank LoBiondo), the bill was cosponsored by four additional Members of Congress: * Mimi Walters (R-CA) * Jeff Denham (R-CA) * Richard Hanna (R-NY) * Pete Sessions (R-TX)  Legislative history  The following shows the legislative history of the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act: * 2/3/16 – The bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure * 2/4/16 – The committee referred it to the Subcommittee on Aviation. * 2/11/16 – The committee considered and amended (“marked up”) the bill. * 2/11/16 – The bill was ordered to be reported favorably from the committee by a vote of 32-26. The Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2016 (H.R.4721) was a separate bill introduced by Congressman Shuster on March 10, 2016. It did not include the privatization of air traffic controllers due to opposition in the Senate. On March 30, 2016, after being signed by President Obama it became Public Law 114-141.https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4721?r=1 The bill was a short-term reauthorization of the FAA that expires on September 30, 2017.  Support and opposition  = Support = The bill has substantial bipartisan support in Congress and in the stakeholder community (such as airlines). Many airlines have said that privatizing ATC would be more efficient, cheaper and reduce flight delays. Airlines for America, the trade association representing airlines, supports the privatization of air traffic control. The group wrote, “The flying and shipping public deserve modernized air traffic control infrastructure. Unnecessary flight delays that are often the result of outdated, WWII-era technology and procedures cost the United States an estimated $25 billion in 2016 alone. Benefits of modernization will include: enhanced safety, reduced delays, fuel savings, reduced emissions, increased capacity and greater operational efficiency.” = Opposition = Members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees oppose the proposal because it would reduce their own oversight authority. The same is true for some members of the House Ways and Means Committee; it would take away their role in setting aviation taxes and fees. On February 15, 2016, the New York Times’s editorial board published an article, “Don’t Privatize Air Traffic Control.” Most of the general aviation(GA) community strongly oppose privatizing air traffic control. Citing a similar switch Canada made in 1996(NavCanada), the high fees associated with a private air traffic control in Canada resulted in a significant decline in the GA community. Flying in Canada with anything other than a major airline has become a privilege of the rich.  115th Congress (2017-2018)  Although all bills officially die at the end of a two-year congressional term, Shuster has kept the issue alive when the 115th Congress began. In January 2017 at the start of the 115th Congress, Shuster began to fight again for a new version of his bill and the privatization of ATC. On February 9, 2017, President Donald Trump met with airline and airport executives at the White House to discuss transportation issues. Trump told the attendees that he supports privatizing the ATC system. Trump called the current system too expensive and “totally out of whack” during the meeting. “Trump pledged he would review regulations on the airline industry and work to provide better infrastructure at the nation's airports.” Also on February 9, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved a bill that would again shift the entire ATC system to a stand-alone, nonprofit corporation. The bill would reauthorize the FAA for three years. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bill faces “an uncertain fate in the Senate”. Under the bill, the FAA would retain final say over all safety matters. Additionally, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a series of hearings about FAA reform. In February 2017, the Subcommittee on Aviation held a hearing entitled “Building a 21st Century Infrastructure for America: State of American Airports.” That was the subcommittee's second hearing examining aviation issues in anticipation of the 2017 FAA reauthorization bill. = The 21st Century AIRR Act (2017) = The official logo of The 21st Century AIRR Act published by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (U.S. Government) On June 22, 2017, Shuster reintroduced an updated version of the bill, H.R. 2997, the 21st Century AIRR Act. On June 27, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a markup (a process where a bill is debated, amended, and voted on in a congressional committee) on the bill and it passed by a vote of 32 to 25.“Actions - H.R. 2997 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): 21st Century AIRR Act”. Congress.gov. Published by the Library of Congress. Retrieved 2017-08-24. H.R. 2997 would create a federally chartered, fully independent, not-for-profit organization whose mission would be to operate and modernize the country's air traffic control (ATC) services. The organization would be the service provider for ATC services instead of the FAA. Essentially, the legislation would separate the service provider for air traffic control from the FAA (its regulating agency). The reason to separate the two is to allow the air traffic control system, under the newly created oversight organization, to be free from \\"the government’s inherent bureaucratic inertia, Washington politics, and funding uncertainty.” The new service provider (the not-for-profit organization created by the bill) would be run like a business. It would have a CEO who would be accountable to a board of directors, which would be made up of people nominated from each significant sub-industry of aviation (general aviation, cargo aviation, commercial, etc.). The bill would transition the ATC system to the new service provider over a three-year transition period. It is important to note that the FAA would remain responsible for the safety of the country's sovereign airspace and would be able to regulate the service provider \\"at arm’s length as in most other modern countries worldwide.” The Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the cost of this new bureaucracy at $20 billion over the first ten years. This figure was subsequently revised upward to $98.5 billion. The bill did not have adequate support in Congress, and Representative Bill Shuster has stated that he will no longer pursue it.

He thereby became the first to complete the formal esoterization of Japanese Tendai.  Biography  Information about Annen’s life is sparse. Annen notes of himself that he originally came from the same clan as Saichō. At the age of nineteen, Annen was ordained as a Tendai monk, studying under the Tendai priest Ennin (hyperlink). He did not travel to China for study despite plans to do so, and never became head abbot (zasu 座主) of Mt. Hiei. There are disputes as to whether he completed the 12-year training at Mt. Hiei. In 884, Annen received the Dharma transmission from Tendai master Henjō (遍照). He was appointed abbot of Gankyōji (元慶寺) in 890, succeeding Henjō. Aside other teachers such as Tenkei and Enchin, Henjo was especially influential in Annen’s development, since he provided Annen access to all significant Taimitsu doctrinal and ritual teachings. Little is known about Annen’s activities after 889 (age 49); the year in which Annen died is also contested. Scholarship places the date between 887 and 889 Additionally, there are later stories which give an account of Annen’s retreat into a state of infinite meditation in a cave in the year 915. These stories are similar to the accounts given of the monk Kūkai (空海). Annen was succeeded by Genjo 玄砰, (who was not certified due to Annen’s death), Daie (大慧), and Son’i (尊意).  Writings  Annen was a prolific writer during his time; forty (out of the supposed more than one hundred) of his works are extant, although in some cases their authorship is dubious. The most important works delineating his doctrine are Shingonshū kyōjigi (真言宗教時義, \\"On the Meaning of Teachings and Times in Esoteric Buddhism\\") and the Taizōkongō bodaishingi ryaku mondōshō (胎蔵金剛菩提心義略問答抄, \\"Abbreviated Discussion on the Meaning of Bodhicitta according to the Womb and Diamond [Realities]\\") He also wrote extensively on the precepts and ordination of the Ritsuryō system. His writings have value beyond the school of Taimitsu due to the vast scope of esoteric material included in his scholarship.  Doctrine  Annen’s goal was to unite the various taimitsu doctrines of the contemporary Tendai school into one “true” esotericism that would encompass sectarian divisions and even the totality of the Buddhist experience. He presented a theory known as the “four ones” (shiichi kyōhan 四一教判), in which he stated that the Shingon view of the world consisted of one buddha, one time, one place, and one teaching. He thereby affirmed the suchness of all phenomena, and provided an absolute reading which encompassed all relative theories of Buddhist doctrines. He also reinterpreted the precepts of the Tendai school in light of esoteric teachings. In the Futsu jubosatsukai koshaku (普通授菩薩戒広釈 ), Annen argued for a more lenient attitude towards monks who violated the precepts, arguing for instance that the transgressions should be considered in the context of the person’s whole life, and that the precepts could be violated for certain reasons. Scholarship suggests that Annen’s attitude towards the precepts was due to witnessing his master, Tankei’s violations of laws of sexual conduct, and subsequent defrocking. Additionally, it has been argued that Annen’s treatise contributed considerably to the decline of monastic discipline in the Tendai school.

Family Otto Metzger was the son of Jewish parents: Ludwig Metzger (18521931) and Gretchen (Guldmann) (18641943). He grew up in Nuremberg, Germany, where he met his wife, Sophie (Josephthal) (18941998). First World War Otto Metzger had previously served as a reserve officer in the Bavarian Engineers and so, at the outbreak of the First World War, he was immediately conscripted. He served in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front, and rose to the rank of lieutenant, and was awarded Iron Cross medals (1st and 2nd class). Engineering career in Germany After his early schooling at the Neues Gymnasium in Nuremberg, he continued his studies at the Technical University of Munich, and obtained a Diplom-Ingenieur degree in mechanical engineering at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy. Otto Metzger then spent several years travelling and gaining engineering experience both in Germany, and also in Austria, France, Britain, USA and in Mexico. On his return to Nuremberg in 1912, he took a post with a local metals company, Schmidtmer & Co, first as an engineer, and then becoming a partner. After the First World War, he returned to his previous work; the company (then called Süddeutsche Metallindustrie) was taken over by Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke AG in 1926, and in 1930 became a subsidiary of the conglomerate Metallindustrie AG. He was to stay with that company in various engineering and management positions until 1938, during which time he developed and patented inventions related to impact- extrusion of zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals. Typical products for these patents were seamless cans for zinc-carbon batteries, brass shell casings, and containers for foodstuff and for drinks. Nazi persecution and emigration Starting in about 1933, the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany intensified. This reached a climax on 9November 1938, when Jews were attacked in their homes and businesses during the night of Kristallnacht. Otto Metzger was returning from Britain, where he had just concluded a licensing agreement with a British company, Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd, to use his patented impact- extrusion technology. He was arrested by the Gestapo at the German border, on his way home to Nuremberg, and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Meanwhile his wife, having had their home and belongings invaded and smashed by Nazi stormtroopers and having spent the night wandering the streets of Nuremberg, waited in vain for Otto’s return. Otto Metzger was released from Dachau on 15December 1938, and returned home to Nuremberg. By late-February 1939, he had managed to obtain the necessary travel documents to leave Germany, and he and his wife left for Britain. Otto had been unable to obtain documents for his mother Gretchen (who by that time was aged 74); she remained in Nuremberg, and was transported by the Nazis to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she died in 1943. Later life in Britain On arrival in Britain in early 1939, Otto Metzger was immediately employed by Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd. He stayed with the company until his retirement in 1958, rising to the position of Managing Director. During the Second World War, Otto Metzger was not interned as an enemy alien, as were most German immigrants; the British Government valued his expertise for the war effort.

History The Škoda 7.5 cm Model 1911 was developed and built by Škoda at the Pilsen works. At the time the Austro-Hungarian Army was looking to modernize its artillery and a number of test models were built. The Austro-Hungarian Army did not order the guns, but they attracted the interest of the Chinese Army and after testing they placed an order with the first shipments beginning in 1912. A repeat order was placed in 1914 and after the outbreak of World War I a shipment of guns aboard a ship destined for China were confiscated by the Italians, who were at that time still neutral. It is believed that the guns seized by the Italians were used by the Italian Army during World War I. The twenty four remaining guns of the Chinese order were confiscated and incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Army. After World War I the surviving guns were passed to the Czechoslovak Army and in 1938 six guns were estimated to still be held in reserve.

The game features vehicles by Volkswagen as part of a licensing deal between Infogrames and the automotive company.  Gameplay  The player begins the game with a standard 1960s Volkswagen Beetle; additional vehicles become available after the player wins races and earns points. The game features 20 race tracks that include environmental elements such as rain and bright sunshine, and includes 17 vehicles that come in more than 50 different styles. In addition to original and New Beetles, the game also features the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, the Volkswagen Thing and Volkswagen buses as playable vehicles. The game includes three gameplay modes: Quick Race, Championship, and Beetle Challenge. Each mode is further divided into five racing modes, known as events, that vary the gameplay: * Buggy: a beach race in which the player must avoid wet sand. * Cross: a stadium with a dirt track consisting of dunes and slopes. * Jump: a track in which the player uses \\"nitro boosters\\" to achieve a large jump. * Monster: a track filled with obstacles in which the player's vehicle is transformed into a monster vehicle with four large tires. The player must smash other vehicles and cause destruction within a time limit, while avoiding traffic cones. * Speed: a street race on a two-lane highway with no nitrous boosters or large obstacles. Specific types of vehicles are used for each event. The game includes a multiplayer mode for two to six players, using a local area network.  Development and release  Beetle Crazy Cup was developed by Xpiral and published by Infogrames. Miguel Tartaj, an executive producer at Xpiral, explained that the idea for the game's concept \\"came from doing all sorts of driving trials. VW had just announced the launch of the New Beetle and we are all 'classic' Beetle enthusiasts so we decided to focus on the Beetle and give it what it deserves: a great game dedicated just to it. The Beetle has always been very popular and people have done incredible things with it since it was first designed.\\" Xpiral secured a publishing agreement with Infogrames after a few meetings. Infogrames signed a licensing deal with Volkswagen to feature the automotive company's vehicles in the game. Xpiral worked on the game for two years. The game was developed with Ambush, an original 3D game engine that was created by Xpiral. The game was announced by Infogrames in December 1999. The game was released in the United Kingdom on 29 February 2000, and in the United States on 6 April 2000.  Reception  Beetle Crazy Cup received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Anthony Baize of AllGame called the game \\"a gem for racing fans and Volkswagen aficionados\\". Baize praised the game's graphics and its surf music, and wrote that the \\"best aspect\\" was the event modes. Tom Price of Computer Gaming World wrote that it \\"is a near-perfect replication of the unique sensation of owning and driving an older .\\" Price noted the vehicles' \\"cartoony\\" graphics, \\"tinny and farty\\" sound effects, and wrote that they \\"handle like crap, just like a real VW,\\" but stated that the game \\"has a weird fun factor\\" because of its various gameplay modes and diverse lineup of Volkswagen vehicles aside from Beetles. Amer Ajami of GameSpot wrote that the different game modes keep Beetle Crazy Cup \\"fresh and enjoyable\\", but criticized the Jump and Monster events for difficulty relating to the controls. Ajami wrote that the vehicles \\"are modeled with a fair amount of detail and are skinned using adequate texture sizes. However, the tracks are somewhat lacking by comparison: The textures used along most of the courses are washed out, and sprite-based trees, crowds, and other outlying objects are typical throughout the entire game.\\" However, Ajami noted that the game's graphics were \\"on par with similar racing games.\\" Jeff Nash of The Electric Playground called the game's controls \\"surprisingly solid\\" but criticized the small number of tracks offered in each racing event, and felt that the game did not offer enough vehicles. Because of the \\"sluggish\\" controls, Nash wrote that the Monster event was \\"a bore to play as the slow movement makes it very difficult to stay interested.\\" Nash noted that the Speed mode \\"is by far the most fun\\" because of its \\"nice selection of tracks with just the right amount of twists and turns\\", and stated that the Buggy and Cross events \\"are both respectable, but the unimaginative track design in these modes makes their races wear thin too quickly.\\" Nash wrote that the game's images \\"are very crisp, and the details around the track are well above average. The graphics do suffer where effects are concerned, however. Reflection, lighting, and smoke effects are all very bland, and often seem to have been thrown in just for the sake of having them there.\\" Nash praised the sound effects, but wrote that the music \\"is so abysmal that it could drive almost anyone to the brink of insanity in no time.\\" Jim Preston of Daily Radar gave the game a positive \\"Hit\\" rating, but called the Monster event mode \\"the weakest of the five modes, as we really weren't interested in avoiding cones or mastering precision driving in a monster truck.\\" Preston noted that the graphics \\"are, not surprisingly, ok. The cars are shiny and realistic, but there is no damage modeling, so plowing headfirst into a guard rail won't cause a scratch. And don't look for any icing on the cake; there are no realtime shadows, 32-bit color or colored lighting here. But the weather effects are fairly realistic, and the night drives through the gloom are actually rather pretty. The backgrounds during the Speed and Buggy modes are realistic and colorful, although not widely varied.\\" Preston concluded that Beetle Crazy Cup was an \\"unpretentious little game that doesn't claim to be anything more than a budget title.\\" Rich Rouse of IGN wrote that the game had \\"quite possibly the most entertaining comedic intro in the history of PC racing games,\\" and noted the use of the words \\"Beetle Racin'\\" several times in the introduction sequence, \\"as if to signify that this was the title of the game when it in fact should read 'Beetle Crazy Cup.' This little tidbit lends to the hypothesis that either the title was changed towards the end of production and there wasn't enough time to alter the intro, or that this was simply a glaring error of the quality assurance team.\\" Rouse called the graphics \\"extremely impressive,\\" but criticized the music: \\"Sounding like a cross between old school country and a circus clown melody, the orchestration here is more than disturbing. Conversely, it must be admitted that these tunes seemed oddly consistent with the general feel of the game.\\" Dave Kosak of GameSpy noted the \\"average\\" sound effects and \\"top notch\\" music, and praised the artificial intelligence, but criticized the game for a lack of customizable vehicles and multiplayer options, as well as the absence of a track editor and the inability to configure tracks. Kosak noted the large number of race tracks and game modes, and wrote that \\"the engine is fast and smooth, and the gameplay is a blast. In that respect, the game is a lot like the car it represents. It's not fancy, but it gets the job done, and it's got tons of style and personality.\\" Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote, \\"A simple and fun race game like Beetle Buggin' amuses you for a few days, and after seeing everything you can possibly see, you'll put it on the shelf and occasionally dust it off for a bit more fun. It has little long-term value, but delivers plenty of short-term kicks.\\" William Brown of The Daily Telegraph said he was disappointed by Beetle Crazy Cup and its \\"sluggish\\" and difficult controls, writing, \\"Never has steering been so difficult in a game that should be pure driving joy. The flower power nostalgia does not redeem what could have been a minor classic.\\" Jim Preston of Next Generation called it \\"Fun and colorful. It's the kind of game your mom would buy.\\"  See also  * Beetle Adventure Racing  References   External links  * Volkswagen Beetle Racing video games Multiplayer and single-player video games Infogrames games 2000 video games Video games developed in Spain Windows games Windows-only games ","title":"Beetle Crazy Cup"},{"id":"53424140","text":"Metropolitan Dionysius may refer to: * Dionysius, Metropolitan of Kiev in 1384–1385 * Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow in 1581–1587 ","title":"Metropolitan Dionysius"},{"id":"53424148","text":"Lumla (Vidhan Sabha constituency) is one of the 60 assembly constituencies of Arunachal Pradesh a north east state of India.

She was graduated from Smith College in 1895, earned her Master's degree in 1897, and her Ph.D. in English from Yale University in 1905. She was an associate professor at Elmira College, 1922–1924. Smyths mother was from old-line Bangor stock, and she spent summers in the insular coastal hamlet of Islesford, Maine. She began collecting folksongs independently, but soon began working with fellow folklorist Fannie Hardy Eckstorm Smyth, with Fannie Eckstorm, created the 1927 book Minstrelsy of Maine: Folk-songs and Ballads of the Woods and the Coast. Smyth gathered folk songs from coastal areas, which constitute about half the book (Eckstorm concentrated on songs of lumberjacks and other inland people). Smyth and Eckstorm's work came to the attention of Phillips Barry, and they invited him to collaborate. Their second book, British Ballads from Maine: The Development of Popular Songs with Texts and Airs (1929), lists Barry as an editor. While the collaboration between Smyth, Eckstorm, and Barry was fruitful and cordial, Smyth felt that Barry, although a valuable contributor, should not have been given editorial credit, and that this was done in deference to his gender and scholarly reputation. Smyth was a successful song collector and an able researcher. She described to the Bangor Daily News the patience, persistence, and luck that she (and Eckstorm and Barry) needed in conducting fieldwork. According to Smyth, many people were surprised that anyone would be interested in their old songs, and relationships and trust had to be built over time before sources would open up. One trick Smyth employed would be to sing a song wrongly on purpose, knowing that few could maintain silence in the face of that, and would jump in with their version.

Vasco do Rego SJ (born 8 January 1925) is a nonagenarian Jesuit priest from the region of Goa, who has played a significant role in the promotion of Konkani language, literature and music, particularly after the end of Portuguese rule in the area, post-1961. He has been editor of the religious monthly Dor Mhoineachi Rotti for a long stint. Role played Rego is credited with playing an important role in translating the Old Testament into Konkani. Konkani sacred music Writing in the Herald newspaper, journalist Melvyn Misquita says it was a \\"humiliating experience\\" that led Rego to compose \\"Goa's first Konkani Carol in 1963 and hundreds of original Konkani hymns, including a lengthy 18-verse hymn on St Francis Xavier\\". Fr. Rego contributed many hymns in the Gaionancho Jhelo. In January 2015, at the time of the canonisation of Joseph Vaz, the first Goan saint, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Rego was credited with writing the lyrics to the hymn Jose Vaza, Amchea Bhava (Jose Vaz, Our Brother), which was put to music by Fr. Joaquim Loiola Pereira. This hymn was sung at the Mass where Pope Francis elevated the Goan missionary who worked in Ceylon to the altar and which can be heard at about 2:30:48 into this recording. The site song-from-goa.at has a number of sheet- music versions of the work of Rego. In March 2016, the nonagenarian Rego was credited with being one of the four - two priests, and as many musicians: Fr Ubald Fernandes, Fr Vasco Rego SJ, Schubert Cotta and Roque Lazarus - responsible for writing the lyrics of the Konkani film Enemy. Recognition In Goa, he is credited with playing a major role in the fields of Bible translations into Konkani and liturgical translation, building a Konkani religious vocabulary, composing hymns both in lyrics and music for Konkani, and developing the world of Konkani preaching and writing in the Roman script of Konkani. Long-time Jesuit He has been a member of the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits since 1945, was ordained priest in Belgium in 1955, and was inspired by his theologian-teacher Fr Pierre Charles, S.J. to use the Konkani language and music in the liturgy of the people in Goa, where Konkani is a widely spoken language. Rego was the Rector of Goa's famed Bom Jesus Basilica, where the remains of saint Francis Xavier reside, during which period many prominent global figures visited this shrine, among them being Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, President Mario Soares of Portugal, Russian and Indian cosmonauts and Pope John Paul II. Rego is the grandson of Roque and Claudina Correia Afonso, a couple who had seven priests among their 52 grandchildren. His brother is Fernando do Rego.

Kate Faulkner was an artist and designer from a family of artists and designers. She was a sibling of Charles and Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith and one of the founder members of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. She practiced in a variety of media: wood engraving, embroidery, gesso painting, tile painting, wallpaper design, fabric design, and china painting. Her work has historically been confused with, or obscured by, that of her sister, artist and author Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith, because on occasion they worked in similar fields at roughly parallel times. Her work was often collaborative, and she was highly skilled at interpreting the designs of other artists. For example, in 1883 she decorated a piano after a design by Edward Burne-Jones for the home of Alexander Constantine Ionides, one of the major patrons of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. It is unclear which sister reinterpreted of the wood block engraving for Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s title page design for the second edition of Christina Rossetti’s ‘Goblin Market and Other Poems’ (1865). At the time of the commission both Kate and her sister Lucy worked at the firm Smith and Linton's, which undertook the engraving.

She wrote poems, short stories, and approximately 34 melodramas of which only 11 remain extant. She is mostly known for adapting dramatic versions of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Last Days of Pompeii (1835) and Ernest Maltravers (1838), and Robert Montgomery Bird's Nick of the Woods (1838), among others. In an era when successful plays typically ran 3-4 nights, Last Days of Pompeii set a record by running for twenty-nine days.Amelia Howe Kritzer, 'Antebellum Plays by Women: Context and Themes' in The Oxford Handbook of American Drama, ed by Jeffrey H. Richards and Heather S. Nathans (116) This was the earliest known example of a \\"long run\\" for a play, a technique which became regularly used by Thomas Hamblin. Medina is also accredited as the first women in American Theatre to earn her living exclusively as a dramatist. Louisa Medina's progressive inclinations concerning her education and self-reliance marks her as an indicator of the rise of First-Wave Feminism in America.\\"NWHM Exhibit: The History of Women and Education.\\" NWHM Exhibit: The History of Women and Education. N.p., n.d. Web. 03 Mar. 2017 Early life and education Few details are known about Medina's early life, but she spent most of her life in Europe. According to an interview she gave to the Spirit of the Times, her father was a Spanish shipping magnate whose business went bankrupt, leaving her in the charge of distant relatives. Although the unknown relatives were indifferent to her education, Medina pursued \\"the bold, masculine studies usually adopted by the male rather than the female gender.\\"The Spirit of the Times, 1 October 1836, page 258. She reportedly learned Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and English by the time she was a teenager. She began writing for London annuals at the age of twelve, from which point she began traveling throughout Europe.Ibid. At the age of 19, Medina emigrated to the United States, arriving in Philadelphia on the passenger ship Thames\\" in 1831.June 30, 1831, in \\"Philadelphia Passenger Lists, 1800–1945,\\" www.ancestry.com, accessed 8 March 2017. Upon arriving, she went to New York, where tutored French and Spanish while writing stories for local publications.Spirit of the Times, Ibid. She became the governess of Bowery Theatre manager Thomas S. Hamblin's children, and, ultimately, the Bowery's chief playwright and Hamblin's partner. It is speculated that Medina and Hamblin entered a relationship prior to Hamblin's divorce with his last wife. Works While Medina's plays were wildly successful, she drew nearly universal admiration from her peers and the press. Theatrical manager and actor Lester Wallack wrote in his memoirs that Medina \\"was one of the most brilliant women I have ever met.\\"Lester Wallack, Memories of Fifty Years (1889), page 119. An article in the New York Mirror praises 'the fertility of her invention–which is one of the highest attributes of true genius.'The New York Mirror' 28 April 1838, page 351. Many of Medina's plays were presumably lost in the numerous fires that destroyed the Bowery. Besides the plays mentioned above, she also write the early horror story 'Burial by Fire' (1838),The Ladies' Companion June 1838, pages 61-65. 'Panorama of Life' (1838),Burton's Gentleman's Magazine November 1838, pages 325-327. and composed the dedicatory address at the re- opening of the Bowery in 1837 after a fire.'Address' The New-Yorker 21 January 1837, page 287. At least one story, 'Chess Play' (1843) seems to have been published posthumously.The Rover 22 May 1843, pages 61-62. Medina's association with Hamblin made her the chief dramatist of the Bowery Theatre in 1833, and one of the most successful dramatists of the day. In his first spell as Bowery manager, Hamblin accrued heavy debt, which threatened to drive the theatre into ruin. Medina's plays, especially Last Days of Pompeii is credited with saving the Bowery.Rosemarie K. Bank, 'Theatre and Narrative Fiction in the Work of Nineteenth-Century American Playwright Louisa Medina\\" Theatre History Studies vol 3 (1983), page 61. Medina's plays, almost always adapted from novels, blended romantic melodrama and spectacle. According to one source, 'she is partial to startling and terrible catastrophe.'The Spirit of the Times, page 258. The Last Days of Pompeii included the spectacle of an erupting volcano on stage and Nick of the Woods had two characters ride a flaming canoe over a waterfall. Controversy and death In 1838, Hamblin took on eighteen-year-old ingenue Louisa Missouri Miller to star in Medina's Ernest Maltravers. Miller was the half-sister of Josephine Clifton, an actress who had previously worked for Hamblin (and probably been his mistress for a short period). After Miller earned a resounding success in her role, her mother, a notorious brothel owner, tried to take Miller from Hamblin's influence, which resulted in Hamblin arranging for Miller to be his ward. Miller went on to live with Hamblin and Medina amidst rumour that she was Hamblin's mistress. Shortly after this affair, Miller suddenly died of \\"brain fever,\\" with many people suspecting Medina of poisoning her rival.For an account of these events, see Miriam Lopez Rodrigues, Women's Contributions to Nineteenth-Century American Theatre (2011), pages 32-33, as well as Patricia Cline Cohen, et al, editors, The Flash Press (2008), pages 33-38.

Medina would die a few months later from mysterious causes in the home that she shared with Hamblin. Although some accused Hamblin of poisoning her, the coroner's inquest found that the case of her death was apoplexy.'Inquest on the Body of Louisa Medina Hamblin' The New York Spectator 15 November 1838, page 3.

Resisting with the Communists during the Second World War and then excluded from the Party, he narrowly escaped death in the camps. After the war he studied at Babeș-Bolyai University. He is a philosopher, mathematician and science historian, who specialized in the philosophy of mathematics. He worked on non-Euclidean geometry, mathematical irrationality, freedom, Plato and Platonism, Aristotle, Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel. He died on May 11, 2010, in Paris Biography Tóth was the son of an official of the Habsburg army who had fought in Italy during the World War I with the twelfth Imperial-Royal Horse Artillery Regiment. His father's name was Abraham Roth, but Imre falsified his own documents, choosing \\"Toth\\" as a contrivance to escape anti-Jewish persecution, certain as he was that Roth would soon be recognised as a typically Jewish name. He studied at a Roman Catholic high school, where he found no answer to his doubts about mathematical issues, according to him because of teachers either incompetent or hardly inclined to discuss the truly problematic aspects of those issues. This inclination of his towards such problems apparently explains why he became interested in philosophy, an interest which was to be later fostered by his father's decision to send him to the theological rabbinical seminary in Frankfurt, in order that the young scholar could so have access to the Institute's rich philosophical library. Subsequently, Imre enrolled at the King Ferdinand I University in Cluj; the teaching work of some outstanding faculty members seems to have at this stage reawakened his strong interest in mathematics. With the World War II Imre Tóth's family was displaced, but his father had beforehand grouped together quite a few of his family's philosophical works, including the Critique of Pure Reason of Immanuel Kant, the Ethica of Baruch Spinoza, and some works by Denis Diderot and Friedrich Nietzsche. Finally, he left a letter asking that the books were not captured. In 1940 Imre entered the underground resistance movement to the Nazis, joining a communist group: for these activities (in particular, for writing on a wall Down with fascism, down with the war, death to fascists) he was arrested and, after interrogation and torture, sentenced to death. He managed somehow to serve a mere six years in prison, and was joined there by news of the successful Operation Overlord (the Normandy landings of the Allies) on June 6, 1944, just as his deportation to Auschwitz along with the group of remaining Jewish inmates of that prison was practically underway. During his last period of imprisonment he was injured by a guard, and hospitalized; he was forced for a while to walk with crutches. Soon did he recover, but his gait was to remain hindered for life. As a detainee he worked out numerous reflections on The Quadrature of the Parabola, a treatise by Archimedes, laying the groundwork for future studies. Following the outcome of the war, he was awarded recognition as \\"the youngest working class hero in the Resistance\\". After the end of conflict he took up his studies at the Babeș-Bolyai University, attending classes in mathematics and philosophy from 1945 to 1948. Later on he would teach philosophy and history of mathematics at the University of Bucharest. In 1958 he was struck off the Romanian Communist Party, due to his harsh criticism of the government (he was accused of being an \\"idealist enemy\\", and an \\"agent of imperialism\\"), so he expatriated to Federal Republic of Germany and prosecuted his academic career teaching from 1969 to 1971 at the Goethe University Frankfurt and from 1971 to 1972 at the Ruhr University Bochum. Later until 1990 he held the chair of the History of Sciences at the Institute of Philosophy of the University of Regensburg. Tóth gave lectures in many universities in Europe and overseas, from Frankfurt to Princeton (Institute for Advanced Study), from the Italian Institute for Philosophical Studies to the École Normale Supérieure of Paris, the city where he died.

Pilla was acting as a road manager for the three musicians. Pilla and Watt kept in contact and, later in November 2009, Pilla invited Watt to Florence where Pilla introduced Watt to his friend, drummer Andrea Belfi. Watt decided to name the trio \\"Il Sogno del Marinaio,\\" which translates to The Sailor's Dream. Watt chose an Italian name in honour of his mother's and band member's Italian heritage as well as his father's maritime service as a sailor. The band began a short tour of Italy almost immediately after its formation, and recorded its debut album La busta gialla between shows only a week after the band's inception. =La busta gialla (2009–2013)= The band's debut album, La busta gialla, was recorded in Varano Borghi, a small town in northern Italy, during its first tour of the country in 2009.

It was established in its present form in 2012 from the merger of Sir John Cass Faculty of Art, Media and Design and the Faculty of Architecture and Spatial Design at London Metropolitan University, though it has a history stretching back to the 1800s via its various predecessor institutions. The school took its former name from philanthropist Sir John Cass (1661–1718), who helped establish funding for education in Aldgate and whose statue is displayed in the University: however, his name was removed from the institutional name in June 2020 because of his associations with the slave trade. The school is presently based at the University's refurbished Aldgate Campus which comprises three buildings, Goulston Street, Calcutta House and The Calcutta Small Annexe in Aldgate, London. The school offers courses across a range of subject areas: art (encompassing fine art, photography, English, creative writing, theatre and performance practice), architecture (including spatial planning and urban design) and design, which includes 3D design (fashion, textiles, furniture, product and jewellery), interiors and visual communication. Courses are provided at all levels including short courses, foundation year, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Learning through practice, playing with process and working with clients; students at the School gain real-world experience in both individual and collaborative projects, engaging with professionals, communities and companies. There is a strong emphasis in the teaching studios on socially engaged architecture, art and design applied to both local and global contexts. The many specialist facilities available to students include wood, metal and plastic workshops, darkrooms and digital manufacturing technology. The school's regular exhibitions, including the famous Summer Show, regularly attract large audiences. Studios A studio or unit is a study group with a particular theme or focus taken by year two and three undergraduate art, architecture and design students and by postgraduate architecture students at The Cass as part of their studies. Studios are led by both academic staff and professional practitioners, sometimes linking to external organisations or project briefs. At the start of each academic year, the leaders of each studio present their studio's themes, position and approach to allow students to choose from a wide range of issues, methods of working and types of project. During the year the studios come together for major events such as Celebration Week – when students present work in progress to panels of external critics – and summer exhibitions. Controversy over sale of Central House Controversy erupted in late 2015 after London Metropolitan University unveiled plans to cut many of the Cass's signature programmes while moving the Cass from its traditional Aldgate location (which would be sold) to its Holloway campus; this plan attracted opposition from many of Britain's most renowned artists and designers. Senior members of the faculty, such as dean Robert Mull, resigned in protest over the decision and other initiatives, amid protests by students and staff. Despite the opposition, the sale went through in February the next year, though the building continued to be leased out to the university. Location in Aldgate In March 2019 London Metropolitan University formally announced that The Cass would remain in Aldgate. The decision, which was made following a series of discussions with students, staff, industry professionals and the local council, was formally ratified by the University's Board of Governors and announced to the School by the University's Vice-Chancellor Professor Lynn Dobbs Name change On 10 June 2020, the University announced that it would be dropping \\"Sir John Cass\\" from the school's institutional name with immediate effect. The school is now known as The School of Art, Architecture and Design, pending a further official name change. The decision was made in the wake of the George Floyd protests, and calls by the Black Lives Matter movement for the removal and revision of monuments and names commemorating historical figures connected with the slave trade.

Biography  = Family = Olena Lvivna Kulchytska was born on September 15, 1877 in the town of Berezhany in the Ternopil region. Father — Lev Teodorovich Kulchytsky (1843 - December 4, 1909) — court counselor, lawyer, public figure, member of many societies. Mother — Maria Yakivna Kulchytska (? - December 29, 1939). = Learning and the first steps in art = In 1894 she graduated from an 8-grade school at the monastery in Lviv. For several months (1901-1902) she and her sister Olga attended the Lviv School of Arts and Crafts where she received her first lessons in watercolor. Olena Kulchytska completed her art training at the private studio run by R. Bratkowski and S. Batowski-Kaczor in Lviv (1901–3) and the Vienna School of Industrial Design (1903–1908). After graduating, she took a year to travel through the major European art centres, including Munich, Paris, and London. Later in life, she worked as an art teacher at secondary schools in Lviv (Queen Jadwiga of Poland Gymnasium, 1909-1910) and Przemyśl girl school (1910–1938). = Privacy = The artist had no family of her own, she devoted her life entirely to art. Work Kulchytska’s first solo exhibition took place in Lviv in 1909. It showcased her engravings, prints, watercolours, woodcuts, and filigrees. The exhibition was celebrated by the early-modernist Ukrainian artists, for instance, Ivan Trush. Kulchytska’s work combined the folk art traditions of the Western Ukraine, particularly, the Hutsuls, with the stylistic innovations of the European Sezession. Later, she exhibited her works in Krakow, Warsaw, Poznań, Kyiv, and other European cities. During 1920-1930, Kulchytska made major contribution to the Ukrainian book design. She illustrated various works by Ivan Franko, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Vasyl Stefanyk, and Yurii Fedkovych, as well as more than 70 books for children for the series «For Our Littlest Ones», which included Oscar Wilde’s ‘The Star-Child’ (1920). In the field of applied arts, she designed 80 kilims in collaboration with her sister Olha. Activism During the World War I, Kulchytska depicted the sufferings of the civilian population and refugees. Her works were reproduced as postcards by the Ukrainian Women's Committee to Aid Wounded Soldiers in Vienna. Kulchytska was part of the civil resistance movement under Stalinism. She helped the families of those who were repressed and deported to Siberia. In 1955, Kulchytska began campaigned against the closure of the Lviv Art College. She financially supported the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine.

Born in Deptford, then in Kent, James' parents died when she was young, and she was brought up by a former employee of her father. She found work making confectionery, and in 1889 she joined the Women's Trade Union Association (WTUA). As a result, she was sacked from her job, but the WTUA helped her find work as a typist, while she volunteered as an organiser and assistant secretary of the WTUA. Its activist Amie Hicks provided her with accommodation and legally adopted James as her daughter.\\"James, Clara Grace\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Through the WTUA, James founded the Confectioners' Union, and served as its general secretary. She worked with Clementina Black and John Burns to win a strike among chocolate makers in 1890, but the union faced high levels of opposition from employers and a highly mobile workforce, leading to its decline and dissolution in 1892. Thereafter, James focused her efforts on trying to organise box-makers. Lilian Gilchrist Thompson paid the WTUA £70 a year for two years to employ James as an investigator. James and Hicks were the only two women to give evidence to the 1891 Royal Commission on Labour. James also served as a delegate to the London Trades Council, and for a time was the only woman to do so. The WTUA was refounded in 1894 as the Women's Industrial Council (WIC), and James remained active within it, serving on both its investigation and organisation committees. However, with her sponsorship having concluded, Thompson instead paid for her training as a gymnastics teacher. Once she had completed this, James set up a series of \\"Working Girls' Clubs\\", providing lectures, physical drills, social meetings and citizenship classes. These proved popular, and in 1899 the WIC founded the Clubs Industrial Association to formalise this activity. Among the young women who attended her classes was Margaret Bondfield. James eventually left the Clubs Industrial Association, founding the rival Working Girls at Play organisation, which by 1909 organised 22 regular clubs across London. She began suffering from poor health and had to give up teaching, retiring to Canvey Island. There, she served as a parish councillor, and ran a holiday home for working girls from London.

After being sold cheaply as a foal she was eventually sent into training with Frances Crowley in Ireland. In four races as a two-year-old in 2004 she showed very promising form, winning a maiden race and finishing placed in both the Moyglare Stud Stakes and the C L Weld Park Stakes. In the following spring she finished sixth in the 1000 Guineas before recording her biggest victory in the Irish equivalent three weeks later. Her victory made her the first Irish Classic Race winner to be trained by a woman. She was well beaten in three subsequent races and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Saoire (Irish for \\"holiday\\" or \\"freedom\\") is a chestnut mare bred in Wales by Louise Parry of the Pembrokeshire-base Pantycoed Stud. As a foal she was entered in the Tattersalls sale in November 2002 and was bought for 4,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Larry Stratton. In September 2003 she returned to the sales ring at the Tattersalls Ireland sale and was sold to Martin Cullinane for €65,000. The filly subsequently entered the ownership of Joseph Joyce and was sent into training with Frances Crowley at Edenderry, County Offaly. Crowley, formerly a successful amateur jockey under National Hunt rules is married to the leading Irish jockey Pat Smullen and is the sister-in-law of the trainer Aidan O'Brien. Her sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an “excellent” sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Farhh, Sariska, Somnus, Kyllachy and Excellent Art. Saoire's dam Polish Descent was an unraced mare who produced several other winners including Awinnersgame who won a valuable sales race at Doncaster Racecourse in 2008. She was a descendant of What Joy, a half-sister to the dam of Mon Fils. Racing career =2004: two-year-old season= Saoire made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Limerick Racecourse on 22 July in which she started at odds of 7/1 and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by the favourite Showbiz. In a similar event at Leopardstown on 15 August she started the 11/2 second choice behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Mona Lisa in an eighteen-runner field. Ridden by Fran Berry, she raced in mid-division early on, made steady progress in the straight and caught the favourite in the final strides to win by a short head. The filly was then stepped up sharply in class for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and finished strongly to take third place behind Chelsea Rose and Pictavia. Saoire ended her season in the C L Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh on 2 October. Starting the 100/30 third favourite she stayed on in the closing stages to finish second to Jazz Princess with Virginia Waters in third. =2005: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Saoire was sent to England for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 May in which she was ridden by Jamie Spencer and started at odds of 16/1. After being restrained by Spencer in the early stages she stayed on in the last quarter mile and finished sixth of the twenty runners behind Virginia Waters, Maids Causeway, Vista Bella, Karen's Caper and Cape Columbine. Crowley subsequently stated that the filly had become upset on the flight from Ireland. Three weeks after her run at Newmarket Saoire was one of eighteen fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh, with Mick Kinane taking the ride. Virginia Waters started favourite ahead of Maids Causeway and the British challenger Damson (Queen Mary Stakes, Phoenix Stakes) with Saoire the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. The other runners included Jazz Princess, Mona Lisa, Titian Time (runner-up in the Prix Marcel Boussac) and Penkenna Princess (Fred Darling Stakes). The outsider Sanserif set the pace with Saoire settled just behind the leaders before moving into contention in the last quarter mile. Kinane sent Saoire to the front a furlong out an she held on in a \\"blanket finish\\" to win by a short head and half a length from Penkenna Princess and Luas Line with the first ten fillies home finishing within three lengths of the winner. Crowley became the first woman to officially train a winner of an Irish Classic: Toby Wellesley had trained the winner of the Irish 1000 Guineas in 1948 but did not receive credit as women were not allowed to hold training licenses at that time, and the license was instead held by her male assistant. After the race Kinane said \\"We were right up there from the start and she never dropped out of the first three or four. knew the others were coming to me but she picked up really well\\" while Crowley commented \\"I was watching from a little way down the track from the winning post and I thought we were second. It's fantastic to win a Classic. I made history a few years ago when I was the first woman to win the Irish amateur riders' title and it is great to do it again\\". Saoire was moved up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 25 June but she made little impact and finished eighth of the ten runners behind the four-year-old Alexander Goldrun. Despite her poor run in the Pretty Polly she was stepped up in distance again for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the same track on 17 July. After reaching fifth place approaching the final turn she could make no progress in the straight and finished sixth behind the French-trained Shawanda. On her final racecourse appearance Saoire contested the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on 10 September. After racing in second place she appeared to be outpaced in the straight and finished fifth to Attraction.

Military career After a chance encounter with King Frederick William I, whom Stutterheim liked, he was admitted to the Berlin Cadet corps in 1729. From 1732 he entered the \\"Regiment Kröcher zu Fuss\\" as a flag-bearer. In 1735, he was promoted to ensign and in 1739, to second lieutenant. As such, he went to the First Silesian War and at the Battle of Mollwitz, Stutterheim demonstrated his command abilities and a keen sense of the battlefield. Always ready to encourage initiative in his officers, Frederick awarded him the Order of Pour le Mérite, and gave him a position at the cathedral in Cammin, and a captaincy in a company in the Regiment La Motte zur Fuss. Stutterheim then fought in the battles of Chotusitz, Hohenfriedberg, and Soor, where, he was wounded. In the year 1747, Stutterheim was promoted to the major and, at the Battle of Lobositz, he again demonstrated his leadership; the king gave him an extraordinary pension of 500 thalers a year. In May, 1757, Stutterheim commanded an infantry regiment as a lieutenant colonel. In this year, in which Stutterheim was also promoted to colonel, he fought at Prague, Kolín, and Breslau; he concluded the year at the Battle of Hochkirch. On 1 January 1759 Stutterheim was promoted to major general and received his own infantry regiment. In 1760 he took part in the battles at Liegnitz and Torgau, where, at the latter, he led a battalion of grenadiers in the initial assault. He was severely wounded at Torgau. In 1761 he returned to the army of Prince Henry, who sent him with 1,600 men to protect the Mark against an invasion of the Swedes. He also made the last campaign, in 1762, under Prince Henry; In the Battle of Freiberg, on 29 October 29, he commanded the left wing of the attacking line. In recognition of his share of the victory, he received a canon at St. Nicolas in Magdeburg. When the peace was concluded, King appointed Stutterheim as inspector of the East Prussian infantry and sent him to Königsberg. In 1768, after becoming lieutenant general on 24 August 1767, he received the Black Eagle Order and another regiment, the former \\"Regiment Kaunitz zu Fuss\\". He was also appointed governor of Konigsberg, Pillau, and Memel. In the War of Bavarian Succession, he was attached to the King's army at the point of a special corps from Upper Silesia. On 16 August 1778, his corps took possession of the city of Troppau.

He led a relatively uneventful career overshadowed by his successful and talented brother until mid-way through the Seven Years' War. At that point, losses in the general staff forced Frederick the Great to dig deeper into the talent pool to replace his general staff, who were dying of old age, in battle, or simply to sick to carry on. At one point tapped to replace the aging and ailing Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, he alienated the King; in 1778, immediately prior to the outbreak of the War of Bavarian Succession, a chance comment by Stutterheim on the pending hostilities got him into trouble with the King. He was relieved of his dignities and honors and sent to his estate in retirement. Family He was born 2 November 1718 on the paternal estate Sellendorf in the Lower Lusatia. His parents were Joachim Friedrich von Stutterheim (1683–1745) and Johanne Eleonore von Hacke (1687–1737). His father was a captain in the Polish-Saxon army, and a landowner.Bernhard von Poten.

März 2017, 18:54 Uhr UTC) Military career Young Stutterheim entered the Prussian infantry at the age of fourteen. King Frederick took him into his retinue, appointed him as a lieutenant-in-chief in May 1757, and sent him to East Prussia on the 6 September, to support the Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, who was standing there against the Russians. After the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August, the aging and ill Lehwaldt had asked that the King send him somebody \\"either to take command of the corps or to assist him.\\" The King sent Stutterheim. At that time (early 1758), the king wrote to Christoph von Dohna, the second in command, who had to replace the old Lehwaldt, to use Stutterheim as a middleman to influence Lehwaldt, but soon Stutterheim managed to irritate the King, Lehwaldt and Dohna. As early as the 4 March, Frederick sent a very unfriendly letter castigating Stutterheim for not sending enough information, and for not acting as he was ordered. The latter accusation was based on the fact that, according to the King's opinion, the Mecklenburg Duchy was not producing enough recruits; this complaint formed the central theme in the King's complaints about Stutterheim's defects for the remainder of the war. Despite this, in 1758 Frederick promoted Stutterheim to colonel and, on 26 February 1759, to major general. On the latter occasion he wrote that he was satisfied with Stutterheim's report on the deliveries of recruits, and hoped that this was the case, and that the Stutterheim should be worthy of advancement. In April 1759 Frederick made Stutterheim Chief of the completed Bornstedt Infantry Regiment Nr. 20. Frederick's pleasure with Stutterheim was short-lived, and revived to be continued throughout the war. Lieutenant Heinrich von Manteuffel, who then commanded against the Swedes in Pomerania, must have had a better opinion of Stutterheim; he asked for him as commander of his infantry, and the King replied that he should have him, but that Manteuffel should not count on him too much. When, on 28 January 1760, Manteuffel fell into Swedish captivity at Anklam, Stutterheim assumed command. The Russians began their movements against Prussia the middle of August; Stutterheim kept retreating further west toward the Prussian border, much to Frederick's annoyance. The more enterprising Wilhelm Sebastian von Belling had greater success against the same adversaries and managed to hold them at bay for a while until strategic necessities of maintaining communication between both forces required him to retreat. Stutterheim kept his command only because Prince Henry, who was instructed to send someone to relieve Stutterheim, declared that he could not dispense with any of his good generals. At the conclusion of the war, Stutterheim managed to stay out of the King's line of sight. On 24 August 1767, Stutterheim was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and in January 1773, he received the Order of the Black Eagle. However, immediately before War of Bavarian Succession, he was completely disgraced. On a visit in Potsdam, in 1778, he allowed himself to comment on the imminent war; the King heard about it and, when Stutterheim asked for his retirement, he received it but, at the same time, the King withdrew his dignities and honors. Stutterheim retired to his estate at Kloster Mansfeld and died there on 29 March 1780.

She moved to Southampton in 1903 before marrying Robert William Foster Welch (a doctor) a year later. Lucia Foster Welch was actively involved in the suffragette movement and was a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the Women’s Social and Political Union. On 4 February 1911 when Emmeline Pankhurst gave a speech in Southampton at the Palace Theatre, Lucia Foster Welch hosted Pankhurst and a number of friends and sympathisers for tea after the event. In 1912 when the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies was concerned that the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage was going to concentrate its activities on Southampton that winter, Lucia Foster Welch was made head of a committee formed to oppose them. However little anti-suffrage activity appears to have taken place in Southampton during the relevant period. In 1918 with elections suspended due to the war Lucia Foster Welch was co-opted to the town council as the then town's first female Councillor. Later that year when elections were held she defended her seat representing Newtown. In 1927 she was elected as the town's first female Mayor. At the time it was a regular part of the mayor's duties to greet more distinguished travelers at the docks. In this role Lucia Foster Welch greeted Henry Ford.

History View of the castle from the south. Baldenstein Castle was the family castle for the Knights of Baldenstein, the first of which was mentioned in 1246. The central tower which now forms part of the castle was built around the same time. Very little is recorded about the Baldenstein family and by 1289 the castle was owned by the Freiherr von Löwenstein. Before 1289 he lost the castle in a war with the Freiherr von Rhäzüns, but in the peace treaty of that year received it back after giving Schwarzenstein Castle to Rhäzüns. In 1349 it passed to the Übercastel family. Wilhelm von Übercastel planned to expand and strengthen the castle, but was prevented by the Bishop of Chur, until he granted the Bishop certain rights. Originally the castle consisted of a rectangular bergfried. During the Late Middle Ages an administrative and residential wing was added to the west. Around 1400 the castle passed to the Freiherr von Stein. Through marriage it then passed to the von Ringg (later Ringg von Baldenstein) family in 1453. In 1562 Luzius Ringg sold the castle to Jakob Ruinelli. The Ruinelli family lived in the castle for several generations. Jakob's grandson, also named Jakob, accompanied Jürg Jenatsch to Rietberg Castle in 1621 to murder Pompeius Planta during the Bündner Wirren. He, in turn, was stabbed to death in 1627 in a brawl between drunken officers. After his death the castle was inherited by the Rosenroll family. During the 16th and 17th centuries the castle was further expanded with a new, larger wing replacing the medieval residential wing. During the same time, the medieval ring wall was replaced with a new crenelated wall. In 1738 the castle was acquired by the Salis-Sils family, who owned it for almost half a century. In 1782 it was inherited by Francesco Conrado, from Chiavenna in Italy. Francesco became a member of Senate of the Helvetic Republic after the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798. Eventually his descendants changed their name to Conrad and still own the castle. In 1877 the residential wing was mostly destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt to its present appearance in the following years.

The residential wing has many Gothic Revival elements from the repairs following the 1877 fire. The tower-like avant-corps was topped with crow-stepped gables after the repairs. On the ground floor of the residence wing is a hall with a painted ceiling from the third quarter of the 17th century and a fireplace with the coat of arms of the Rosenroll and Ruinelli families.

Subsequently, he participated at the Battle of Königsberg (1807) on 14 June 1807 in support for the 3rd Outpost Brigade commanded by Prince von Anhalt Schaumburg. There he had his Fusiliers Nr. 21, two infantry battalions, four squadrons of dragoons, and 1 horse artillery battery. Most of the third outpost brigade under the direct command of the Prince had become separated from the main force on the night of 12/13 June and came up behind the French line.

Productions include a children’s television series with a talking chair called Helping Henry and About Face, a television drama with Maureen Lipman. He also won a British Comedy Award for his work with Irish comedian Dave Allen. In 2007, Hardy’s novel Each Day A Small Victory was published in the form of frontline dispatches from amongst the embattled wildlife in an English country lay-by, illustrated by Oscar Grillo. Blue on Blue, Hardy’s darkly comic play on self-harm, was first showcased at the Latchmere 503 in London in 2007. The play was revived in 2016 at the Tristan Bates in London in partnership with BLESMA, the British Limbless Ex-serviceman’s Association. In 2008, Hardy’s one woman dysfunctional Cabaret, There’s Something In The Fridge that Wants To Kill Me!, ran notably at the Edinburgh Festival. In 2009, inspired by an idea from his son Tom, he and Tom created the story that was to become the 2017 eight-part series Taboo. Hardy is the co-creator, a writer and a consulting producer. His work on the screenplay for Taboo earned him the Writer’s Guild of Great Britain award for Best Long Form TV Drama in 2018.

It is harvested from Streptomyces netropsis that also produces netropsin. Distamycin prefers AT-rich DNA-sequences and tetrades of [TGGGGT]4. Distamycin inhibits the transcription and increases the activity of the topoisomerase II. Derivates from distamycin are used as alkylating antineoplastic agents to combat tumours. Derivates with fluorophores are used as fluorescent tags for double-stranded DNA. The compound is hygroscopic, and sensible to light, freeze and hydrolysis.

It was founded by Jonathan Sergison (born 1964) and Stephen Bates (born 1964) in 1996 in London. In addition to the two founding partners, their long standing collaborator Mark Tuff has been a partner of the practice (since 2006).Sergison Bates architects, Papers 2, Editorial Gustavo Gili: Barcelona, 2007 Sergison Bates architects are best known for their residential buildings but have also realised public and institutional projects in the UK, continental Europe and China. In addition to their work as practising architects both Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates have taught architecture at various universities.AA School of Architecture (2001-2002), ETH Zürich (2003-2005), ESARQ Barcelona (2006), EPFL Lausanne (2006-2007), Oslo School of Architecture and Design (2013), Harvard University Graduate School of Design (2014) Jonathan Sergison is a Professor at the Accademia di Architettura in Mendrisio (since 2008), whilst Stephen Bates is Professor and joint head of the Department for Urban Planning and Housing (Lehrstuhl für Städtebau und Wohnungswesen) at the Technical University of Munich together with Bruno Krucker (since 2009). Both architects have written and lectured on a wide range of topics related to architectural design. In 2006 they were awarded the prestigious Heinrich Tessenow Gold Medal and Erich Schelling Medal for their contribution to architecture.  Buildings  Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in the early 1990s and were part of a group of architects, theorists and artists who met regularly between 1994 and 1995.The group included Tony Fretton, Adam Caruso, Mark Pimlott, David Adjaye, Jonathan Woolf, Brad Lachore, Juan Salgado and Ferruccio Izzo. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson.Peter Allison, Outside In – London Architecture, catalogue published by Architekturforum Tirol, Verlag Anton Pustet: Salzburg, 2000 Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture.Irina Davidovici, Tectonic presence, in Sergison Bates, Buildings, Quart Verlag: Luzern, 2012 A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip façade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and cement boards as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book “Brick-work: thinking and making”.Sergison Bates architects, Brick-work: thinking and making, gta Verlag: Zürich, 2005 The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in “Brick-work”) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and monolithic construction form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a loadbearing wall of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented façade elements made of concrete cast in situ. From 2010 Sergison Bates architects were awarded commissions through design competitions for projects in Flanders (Belgium), Switzerland and Austria. In 2016 the firm completed their most prestigious building to date, the Welcome centre and offices for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Shanghai (China).  Writing  In addition to their built work Sergison Bates have produced a significant output of texts, either co-written or authored independently. These were developed from lectures notes or articles for architectural magazines. So far Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates have published three collections of essays: Papers (2002), Papers 2 (2007) and Papers 3 (2016) comprising 54 essays in total.Papers (2002): 10; Papers 2 (2007): 20; Papers 3 (2016): 24 The texts can be described as phenomenological observations of the built environment.Essays with titles include “Working with appearances” and “Learning from looking at buildings” (J. Sergison), “Feeling at Home” and “Ten Rooms” (Stephen Bates) from Papers 2. The architects consider the process of writing an integral part of the reflective work of architectural design.Sergison Bates architects, „Preface“ in Papers 2, GG: Barcelona, 2007 In the introduction to a lecture given at the Harvard School of Design, Iñaki Abalos described Sergison Bates’ work and approach to architecture as follows: \\"In my opinion there is a serious understanding of the meaning of the notion of material cultural in their work, combined with a radical sense of provocation. Radical in the etymological sense, because it goes to the roots, to the radice, the origins and sense of our historical, typological and material patrimonies, understood as the main references an architect has to deal with if he or she pretends to have a sense of time of the city as a collective cultural construction.\\"Harvard GSD. Lecture: Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates, „On Continuity“. Accessed 1. February 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgOk0qCbkSc  Approach and influences  In the Essay “Tectonic presence” Irina Davidovici describes the work of Sergison Bates architects as oscillating between the complementary aspects of the “formal” and the “tectonic” where “the use of images has always been sustained by constructional research”. In the preface to the catalogue of selected works published in 2006, the renowned architectural historian Ákos Morávanszky states that the architecture of Sergison Bates is concerned with “precision” interpreted as an “expression that unveils the significance of nuance”.Ákos Moravánszky, in: Sergison Bates architects, Catalogue 1996-2006, London 2006 In addition to their identity-defining interest in the work of the Smithsons (both their buildings and writings)Jonathan Sergison, “Lessons learnt from Alison and Peter Smithson”, in L’architecture d’aujourd’hui, (344) 2003 – see also Sergison Bates, Papers 2, GG: Barcelona, 2007 – as well as “images of ordinary typologies”, the work of Sergison Bates is inspired by English classicism, as exemplified in their fascination with Hardwick Hall.„Sergison Bates’ inspiration: Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire“.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The arms of its founder (Thomas de Lyons) are on the outside of the tower. The interior has some fine tombs, and some relatives of the poet Robert Southey are buried in the churchyard. The building underwent Victorian restoration between 1871 and 1872 when the chancel, vestry and south chapel were added. In 2011 the heating system in the church failed. Since then solar panels and new radiators have been installed. In 2016 an appeal was launched to replace the flagstones within the church. The parish is part of the benefice of Long Ashton with Barrow Gurney and Flax Bourton within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The church has a nave, north and south aisles, chancel and vestry along with a three-stage west tower. The tower contains a peal of eight bells having been increased from six to eight in 1897 and rehung in 1903. The Tenor of this fine peal weighs in at 30.3.23 CWT or 1573 KG making the bells here the 11th heaviest ring of 8 in the world. After 107 years of continual use, the bells were rehung once again in 2010 By John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, and were hung on self aligning modern ball bearings, making the bells easier to ring. The fine rood screen is from the 15th century. Within the church is a 19th century church organ which was rebuilt by J.G.Haskins & Co. Churchyard Amongst the gravestones and memorials in the churchyard are several which are Grade II* listed buildings. The oldest is for John and Alice Smith who died in 1591. A chest tomb of Elizabeth Phelps from 1698, and one of Anna Whiting from 1700, The memorial to George Whiting was added in 1709, and Robert Whiting in 1662, while another Robert Whiting is from 1679, and another with the same name from 1693. Together the chest tombs, which have renaissance details form an important group. Other monuments are to Philip Bower, the Pomroy family, the Ford family, Elizabeth Hayward, William Cambridge, William Poultney James Miller and John Howard.

Hardison is well known for being one of the first high profile black models after her appearance at the 1973 Battle of Versailles fashion show. She is also known for her activism on diversity in the fashion industry. Hardison has received several accolades for her work, including the 2014 CFDA Founders Award. Hardison is the mother of actor Kadeem Hardison.  Life and career  Hardison was born in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from George W. Wingate High School, Hardison attended the New York University Art School and the Fashion Institute of Technology but did not graduate from either.

Plot Heitor and Alice land a job shooting the wedding of a woman (Bruninha, played by Luíza Mariani) who is marrying the rich son of a Senator and a socialite. It's shown that Heitor has a problem taking too many antidepressants. While shooting the bachelorette party, Heitor meets Penélope, who spots him about to eat an antidepressant that he'd dropped. She steps on it, crushing it to powder, and walks into the party. Heitor accidentally eavesdrops and learns that Penélope is the groom's former lover and that, spurned by the groom's mother, Penélope plans to befriend Bruninha and break up the wedding. Distracted by Penélope, Heitor hands his camera to a waiter (Fernando, played by Fernando São Thiago) and asks him to hold it for him. Fernando takes the camera and starts shooting photos of the bachelorette party. Penélope convinces Heitor to help her get into the wedding when she reveals that she's pregnant. Meanwhile, desperate for more help after an employee leaves, Heitor hires Fernando and instructs Alice to teach him. Penélope and Heitor meet a former lover of Heitor, Laura, who is stunningly beautiful and financially successful. Penélope learns that Bruninha is actually pregnant and decides to not crash the wedding. Meanwhile, Alice stirs up some young protesters to loudly protest the outdoor wedding in the middle of the wedding ceremony, which is swiftly finished. While hiding, Penélope reveals to Heitor that she isn't pregnant and he storms away. That evening Penélope goes to Heitor's house and falls asleep on his couch after apologizing. She wakes to find that he moved her to his bed and slept on the couch himself. Heitor mentions that he doesn't really know what to do with the video because of the protesters who ruined the main portion of the wedding. Penélope buys some presents for Heitor, Alice, and Fernando to apologize and talks them into letting her help edit the wedding video. She says that they aren't making the video for the bride and groom but rather for the parents, and that since the Senator is more important than his wife, they should focus on him. Also, they should lie a little in the video. After finishing, Heitor and Alice deliver the video where Bruninha's mothers is astonished to see a cut of Penélope in the video. It's revealed that they managed to tweak the sounds of the protesters to chant, \\"The Senator is King...\\" etc. The Senator loves it, and when Bruninha's mother tries to pay Heitor 1/10 of the promised price, the Senator instead gives Heitor an even larger check, which he shares with Alice, Fernando, and Penélope. Penélope continues working with them and sets up a social media account for Heitor to meet up with Laura. Penélope then secretly messages Laura as Heitor, even going so far as to engage in cyber sex, then invites Laura to meet at a wedding. Laura arrives drunk and tries to have sex with Heitor then rushes off. Heitor follows at a distance and spots her drunkenly punching holes in a condom with a needle. He convinces Penélope to make a scene, then says that she mixed antidepressants with alcohol and that he has to take her home. Alice gets drunk and kisses Fernando then runs off. That evening, Heitor finds that Penélope has stolen a small memento of every wedding she's been to, including the wedding photograph of his own mother. Heitor is shocked, but says that his love for Penélope is strong enough that he can live with his foible of hers, and that he hasn't taken an antidepressant since he met her. The next morning, Alice wakes up to find that Fernando put her in his bed to sleep it off while he slept on the couch. Alice presents Fernando with a business card with his name on it, welcoming him into the wedding-shooting business, calling it a family, and Heitor gives Penélope a business card with her name on it.

From 1995 to roughly 2004, Carlo was a regular participant in productions at Surf Reality, an underground venue on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Beginning in the mid-2000s she began appearing at performance storytelling events hosted by The Moth, The Liar Show, and Literary Deathmatch. Carlo published her memoir, Fish Out of Agua: My Life on Neither Side of the (Subway) Tracks, in 2010. Her essays and stories have also been published in Huffington Post and SMITH magazines, Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul, and Lost & Found: Stories from New York.

In Carlo's 2010 memoir, Fish Out of Agua, she calls herself a \\"double outsider:\\" Her freckles and curly red hair caused people to often mistake her as white, much to the dismay of her proudly Spanish-speaking relatives, yet she finds that she is not white enough for her friends and schoolmates. At one point she recalls her father telling other residents of their neighborhood that although they may be Puerto Rican, their family was from the \\"Italian part\\" of Puerto Rico, in an attempt to avoid ostracism and prejudice. Later, she recalls getting lost at a Puerto Rican Day parade and a voice on the loudspeaker announcing, \\"'Will the family who brought the little redheaded white girl please come pick her up?' I looked around. I am at the bandstand! I am that lost girl!\\" In her memoir, Carlo's descriptions of such memories use both intimately personal memories as well as humor in order to chronicle a childhood of trying to find some sort of balance in her identity. \\"New York is like a shark,\\" she says in an article by Curbed New York. \\"If it stops moving, it dies.\\" In her latest project, There Goes the Neighborhood, Carlo continues to use her own experiences to reflect New York City's ever-evolving nature. The 55-minute solo performance revolves around her struggle to find a new apartment after being forced out of the one she had lived in for twenty years, and in doing so touches on issues of gentrification in Brooklyn. At one point in the show, she describes riding in a car with a realtor who, not realizing that Carlo herself is Puerto Rican, tells her, \\"I don't recommend that you take an apartment above 10th street, dear...That's where all the Puerto Ricans live.\\" This personal account provides evidence of the physical and social boundaries that obviously still exist within many New York neighborhoods, and in doing so speaks directly to Carlo's Latinx audience (especially those who may be white-passing). In the article by Curbed New York, she also cites the formation of the Prospect Park Alliance and its successful efforts at cleaning up the park and the surrounding area as a tipping point for Brooklyn's gentrification. \\"Nobody wants to be chased up five flights of stairs screaming, 'Open the door' because you're about to be jumped. but why can't there be some kind of common ground that respects the elderly and longtime residents that do not have the wherewithal or desire to relocate? How is it right to tell a family, 'Well now that the neighborhood's safer, and the park is clean and the schools are better, you don't get to live here anymore.'\\" In her observations of this transformation, Carlo questions the motives of those who led the effort to make this area \\"the beautiful oasis it is today.\\" In cleaning up the area surrounding Prospect Park, did such groups also hope to scrub out long-time residents and racial minorities, as well as the unique culture they had created? Overall, reflections on the past in There Goes the Neighborhood and Carlo's other works provide more than just moments of nostalgia for New York natives. They chronicle the evolution of an entire city, and how these changes affect entire groups of people and the Latinx community as a whole.

The SCGC has certification under the Federal Status of the Artist Act to represent the interests of all composers in Canada working on English-language productions. The SCGC is a member of the Coalition for the Diversity of Cultural Expressions.  Background  The SCGC was first founded in 1980 as the Guild of Canadian Film Composers (GCFC)The Toronto Film Scene, Spotlight On: The Screen Composers Guild of Canada, June 5, 2013 by composer and jingle producer Ben McPeek. He wanted to form an association that could demonstrate to the film and television industries that first class scores could be composed and recorded in Canada. By organizing people who had a stake in the business of composing for film and television the GCFC would raise awareness with regard to the talent available in our country. If the work was being done locally there would be considerably savings both in time and money, which was an advantage for the producers/directors. Members also knew that if they couldn’t do the job the work would go to someone locally and therefore keep the work in Canada. By keeping the work in Canada members would then have a better shot at the next job as a result of the growth of the local industry has been ingrained in our organization ever since. This idea of thinking collectively to help the community and in the long run help the individual. Subsequently, more people were hired locally the industry began to take root and less work was being sent to other countries. Ultimately when the industry flourished each of the individuals would benefit. The original members include composers such as Glenn Morley, Harry Freedman, and Bill McCauley. The membership of the Guild was made up not only of composers but lawyers, agents, publishers such as Bob Hahn and Tony Tobias, and others who had an interest in the making of film and television music.  Organization and Growth  In the early 1980s the Guild met at the Canadian Music Centre and had approximately 15 members. The original mandate was \\"The Guild of Canadian Film Composers is a national association of professional composers and music producers for film, television, and new media. The Guild's purpose is to further the interests of its members with respect to Canada's cultural industries and agencies, film producers and music publishers.\\" In the mid 1990s, the Guild created a new mandate \\"To improve the quality and status of music as it applies to film and television, through education and the professional development of its members and the producing community.\\" During this period professional development took on an informal structure with members exchanging information, providing knowledge of contracts, potential jobs and negotiation tactics. The Guild also created a Composer (As Contractor)/Producer Model Agreement which has become a standard in the industry., SCGC Model Contract. The GCFC received certification May 23, 2003 under the Federal Status of the Artist Act. Government of Canada Canada Industrial Relations Board, Status of the Artists Act, Certification, 2013-04-29 The Guild of Canadian Film Composers changed its name to the Screen Composers Guild of Canada in 2010 to reflect the change in the film and television industries to include media for both large and small screens, and the changes in its members' working environments and skills.SaskMusic Directory, Associations In 2014 the Ontario Media Development Corporation funded a research study entitled \\"Baseline Study on the Membership and Industry of the Screen Composers Guild of Canada\\" which documented the professional environment of screen composers in Canada and serves as a baseline for subsequent studies to be measured against.OMDC Research, Screen Composers Guild of Canada Baseline Study  Rights and Representation  The SCGC is a member of Music Creators North America (MCNA), a joint lobbying group made up of the SCGC, the Songwriters Association of Canada, the Society of Composers & Lyricists, The Council of Music Creators, The Songwriters Guild of America, Songwriters of North America, LA Branch, and La Société professionnelle des auteurs et des compositeurs du Québec.Music Creators North America, official website Through the MCNA, the SCGC represents music creators at CIAM, the International Music Creator advisory body for International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC).CIAM Partner Organizations, Music Creators North America, retrieved 03-17-2017.

Nowlin. The film is also produced by Nowlin, alongside Ridley Scott, Wes Ball, Courtney Solomon and Mark Canton. Originally advertised as Phoenix, the film tells the story of the disappearance of three teenagers who set out to find the source of the widely reported 1997 UFO phenomenon known as the \\"Phoenix Lights\\". It was released on April 21, 2017 to mixed reviews, with many critics unfavorably comparing it to The Blair Witch Project. Plot Sophie Bishop and her boyfriend Dan visit Sophie's parents in Phoenix, Arizona on the 20th anniversary of her older brother Josh's disappearance. On March 13, 1997, the family witnesses the Phoenix Lights during Sophie's 6th birthday party, with Josh recording the incident. Several strange lights appear in a \\"V\\" formation over the city before disappearing, followed closely by fighter jets. Josh becomes convinced they have witnessed UFOs, though others remain skeptical. Hoping to find answers to her brother's fate, Sophie begins reviewing all of Josh's saved videotapes. In the tapes, Josh begins investigating the Phoenix Lights with the help of his friends Ashley and Mark. Ashley and Josh interview two astronomers, who theorize that the lights were flares dropped by jets from the nearby Luke Air Force Base. However, Ashley and Josh remain unconvinced. Several days later, more mysterious lights appear over Mesa. Hoping to capture the lights on film and in better quality, Josh, Ashley, and Mark drive to Mesa. Upon arrival, the trio climb a hill on the outskirts of the town before noticing a spotlight in the distance facing sky- ward. Curious, the trio hike toward the spotlight where they find a gathering of Sheriff's Deputies and mysterious men. Josh notices the cars belonging to the men have no license plates. The group is then spotted by the men, forcing them to flee. The next day, Josh plots the apparent course of the lights, determining they will soon appear over an isolated area of the desert. In the present day, Sophie continues to interview multiple parties regarding the trio's disappearance. Only the group's abandoned car and a camera with single tape was discovered. Sophie views the recovered tape, showing the beginning of the group's journey to find the lights and discovering a charred animal corpse. As the tape ends, Sophie refuses to believe Josh did not record the remainder of the trip. She concludes that Josh must have had a second camera. Sophie and Dan visit the local high school, where Ashley was a film editor and would have had access to such equipment. However the film teacher does not have any logs that may have been filled out, leaving Sophie at a dead end. Before departing Phoenix, she interviews her parents who reveal that the strain of Josh's disappearance caused them to divorce. The next night, Sophie receives a call from the teacher, who claims to have found something. She returns to Phoenix and receives a box that had been mailed to the school several years prior before being placed in storage. Sophie and Dan open the box and discover a heavily damaged camera. Dan manages to retrieve the tape from within the camera before watching it with Sophie. The film then cuts to Sophie after having watched the tape, clearly distraught by its contents. She then contacts a Captain at Luke Air Force Base for an interview. Upon arrival however, the Captain appears confrontational with Sophie while Dan waits with the camera in the car. Sophie then returns and claims the Captain ordered her to \\"not let the footage get out\\". Dan asks Sophie what to do next, with Sophie giving him a look of determination. The film then cuts to the contents of the recovered tape, comprising the remainder of the film. The last film begins moments after Josh, Ashley, and Mark find the charred corpse. The trio continues to hike through the desert and up a hill. Meanwhile, Ashley and Mark appear to grow closer, much to the disdain of Josh. After waiting at the top of a hill for several hours, the trio witness a single light in the distance. The light hovers for several minutes before accelerating along the horizon. The light grows progressively brighter and faster before discharging several, smaller lights. All the lights subsequently vanish. The trio celebrate their recording before hiking back to the vehicle. As night falls, the teens become lost and disoriented. Mark ventures up a hill alone to try and spot the car. After he leaves, Ashley and Josh hear loud sound in the distance that appears to be getting closer. A bright light then appears behind the hill before passing over them. Mark returns, visibly distressed but apparently unharmed, claiming to have found the car. As they walk back, Mark refuses to disclose what he saw at the top of the hill. The trio then find the car and attempt to return home. As they drive, the light appears behind the car and pursues them. They attempt to flee before the light disables the car and vanishes. Unable to fix the vehicle, the trio hike along the road attempting to get back to town. As they walk, Mark begins showing severe symptoms of an unknown illness, including a nosebleed, fever, and disorientation. Mark then claims to hear voices, before running out into the desert while claiming to see his brother. As Ashley and Josh run after him, the light returns and Mark vanishes without a trace. Ashley begins to panic, while Josh comforts her. The two then notice a house light in the distance and resolve to follow it. Along the way, the two discover more charred animal corpses. In addition, Ashley also begins to show similar symptoms as Mark, including her hair falling out. Continuing on, Ashley begins to hear an unknown sound. She then claims to see her father in the distance before running off with Josh following her. As they run, the light returns, causing lightning and high winds around them. Josh then captures the source of the light, revealed to be an alien craft appearing as several concentric, rotating rings. Josh then witnesses Ashley being lifted off the ground before being abducted in a flash of light. The tape then cuts to Josh arriving at the deserted home, still pursued by the alien craft. He attempts to hide inside the house. Meanwhile, the craft causes various appliances to explode and gravitational distortion. Josh begins to scream as the craft removes the roof of the house, then also quickly lifts him off the ground in a flash before the camera cuts out. The tape resumes as the camera catches a brief glimpse of space, before falling back down to Earth. The camera lands, recording the sunset for several minutes before dying as the credits roll.

Their original purpose and date of construction are disputed, though most authoritative sources date them to the 19th century. Description and history The caverns comprise an irregular series of neo- Romanesque ambulatories and chambers hollowed out of sandstone, with carved archways, pillars, symbols and niches, apparently for candles. They are located about west of Caynton Hall, beneath privately-owned woodland, within a disused stone quarry. One suggestion is that they were the result of quarrying during the mid-19th century and were then turned by the landowners, the Legge family, into a grotto or underground folly.

There are some stereotypes typically associated with Nigerians and these are both positive and negative. Apart from the general stereotypes, there are peculiar stereotypes concerning the ethnic groups in Nigeria that even other Nigerians believe and propagate.  Positive stereotypes  = Open mindedness = It is generally believed that Nigerians are open-minded and quick to try new things. = Hardworking = Nigerians are generally regarded as hard-working people who are willing to go the extra mile for success. = Proud and happy = Nigerians are regarded as a very proud people. They also feature as one of the happiest people on earth. Nigerians are also highly optimistic people.  Negative stereotypes  = Nigerians are into advance fee fraud = This stereotype is mainly a product of the many Nigerian prince 419 scams which were popular. Many people believe that a large percent of Nigerians are into internet scam and fraud. While it is true that some youths take to it, the stereotype is essentially misplaced as the number of youths partaking in this is minimal. Most internet scammers simply prefer to use Nigeria and Nigerian identities in their schemes. = Nigerians are poor = This stereotype stems from the general perception that Africans are poor and in need of charity. It is important to note that Nigerians have some of the richest people in the world. Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian, is the richest black man alive. The percentage of poor Nigerians is not as high as this stereotype portrays it. = Nigerians are uneducated = This is one of the negative stereotypes about Nigerians and being criminals.

It was first described by Hjalmar Théel, a Swedish scientist. Scotoplanes globosa, along with numerous other sea cucumbers were discovered by Théel during an expedition on the between the years of 1873-1876. Scotoplanes globosa was officially described in 1882, 6 to 9 years after its first sighting. Scotoplanes globosa is most closely related to the genus Peniagone.  Ecology  Congregations of smaller Scotoplanes globosa are often observed on the ocean floor in groups of 10 to 30. However, groups of Scotoplanes globosa have been observed to be as many as 600 individuals in one congregation. A congregation of Scotoplanes globosa is called a “trawl”. These groups of Scotoplanes globosa often appear to all be facing in one direction, into the ocean current. It is believed that this behavior aids S. globosa in the detection of the richest feeding sites. Scotoplanes globosa has also been observed to be the host of multiple deep-sea parasites, such as the small gastropods Stilapex and Crinolamia, and various parasitic crustaceans. These parasites typically bore small holes into the body wall of S. globosa. Scotoplanes globosa are also often accompanied by a symbiotic lithodid crab, the Neolithodes diomedea. It is believed that approximately 22% of Scotoplanes globosa are attended by at least one of these crabs. At this time, scientists are unsure whether the relationship between S. globosa and N. diomedea is mutualistic or commensal.  Anatomy  Scotoplanes globosa is typically 2 to 15 cm in length and appear to be a translucent white color. S. globosa is covered in tube-like feet which are used in locomotion. The tube-like structures found on top of the Scotoplanes globosa are also feet, as opposed to antennae. Scientists are still unsure whether these upper- tube-feet are used in locomotion or used as sensory accessories. They are quite buoyant and are easily displaced by strong currents. = Locomotion = Scotoplanes globosa has a soft, round body with five-to-seven pairs of long, tube-like limbs extending from its body. S. globosa uses these limbs for locomotion. They “walk” along the ocean floor using muscle constrictions to push fluid in and out the tube feet cavities. Scotoplanes is the only genus of holothurians that have been observed to \\"walk\\" in this manner.  Distribution and habitat  Scotoplanes globosa are found in almost all deep-sea regions in the world. Specifically, S. globosa live on the abyssal plain. They are commonly found off the coast of San Diego, as well as in the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Scotoplanes globosa typically live at depths of over 1000 meters, and have been found in the deepest locations in the ocean.  Diet  Scotoplanes globosa is a deposit feeder, eating detritus which has sunk to the ocean floor. S. globosa has been observed to strongly prefer consuming fresh, recently fallen (approximately within the last 100 days) sediments on the surface of the ocean floor as opposed to older sediments. These freshly-fallen sediments are more nutrient-rich. Scotoplanes globosa captures food through its mucous-covered tentacles which surround their mouth. S. globosa is also known to congregate around the carcasses of whales which have fallen to the seafloor. Lundsten et al. (2010) determined that S. globosa find deep-sea whale carcasses by smell, as well as other nutrient-rich food sources; the extremely nutrient-rich whale carcasses also attract other deep- sea creatures in large numbers.''

Controversies In 2016, Jane published an open letter to Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive officer of Yelp, where she worked as a customer service representative for Yelp's Eat24 food delivery service. Her letter focused on Yelp's low wages and the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was fired shortly after publishing the letter, the news of which garnered significant media attention. She received severance pay of $1,000 and wasn't allowed back at Yelp. The letter detailed struggles of living on an after-tax wage of a little more than $8 an hour, living 30 miles from the workplace in an apartment costing $1,245 a month, with commuting costs of more than $11 per day. Several outlets published critiques of Jane's life choices that argued ways to alleviate her economic struggles, such as having a roommate. These pieces painted Jane as an entitled millennial, earning her nicknames such as \\"Narcissa by the Bay\\" from the conservative National Review. In an interview with VICE, Jane shot back against critics, asking \\"Who is the right messenger? Up until now, how many of the people accusing me of being entitled were actually discussing the living wage issue? If they don't think I'm the right voice to say this stuff, why don't they find the person who is and uplift their voice rather than bringing down mine? Any voice is still better than silence.\\" The media storm generated criticism directed at Yelp. Prank orders increased and many customers said they would stop using the service. Yelp responded that the high cost of living was to blame and announced additional customer support jobs in Arizona. Yelp instructed customer service representatives not to talk about their wages to customers. Other outlets used the open letter to promote moving to lower cost areas and to highlight weakened economic conditions for Americans in their 20s and 30s. Two months later, Yelp raised the pay of Eat24 customer service representatives from $12.25 to $14 an hour, added 11 paid holidays (from zero), and increased the number of days of paid time off from 5 to 15. Yelp did not reference Jane in its announcement and said that changes had been in the works since quarter 4 2015 – three months before Jane published her letter. Employees at Yelp reportedly dispute this claim and believe Jane was the \\"whistleblower\\" who prompted the changes. The controversy was highlighted in Nebraskan Junior Senator Ben Sasse's 2017 book The Vanishing American Adult, where he wrote that \\"Some parents may quickly nod their heads in hearing that Talia Jane was fired from her job\\" and claimed \\"Our Founders...would panic at the survivability of a nation if we have too many Ms. Janes\\". In an analysis for the Washington Post, writer Malcolm Harris noted that Jane was \\"pilloried in the media as just another entitled millennial who wanted things handed to her\\" but noted of the resulting wage increase: \\"Many large labor actions have achieved less\\". Jane was named one of Business Insider's 100 \\"most amazing and inspiring people in tech right now\\" as well as one of Inc.com's \\"25 Coolest Women in Silicon Valley,\\" both of which credited her open letter for sparking conversation about living wage in Silicon Valley. She spoke about this experience at XOXO Festival. Her talk focused on the impact of online harassment. In May 2019, she was the recipient of a sexually explicit message via Twitter that was sent to her by a Seattle Times reporter.https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Seattle-Times- reporter-Mike-Rosenberg-DM-sexual-13820880.php The reporter was suspended by the Times and resigned from the paper on June 7, 2019.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two red and cream-coloured flowers long and wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have long, brown, drooping thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal curves forward and is long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals have about the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal although the lateral sepals are slightly wider. The labellum is long, wide and cream-coloured with red lines. The sides of the labellum sometimes have a few short teeth, the tip is curled under and there is a dense band of red or cream-coloured calli along the mid-line. Flowering occurs from August to early October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia radialis was first described in 1927 by Richard Rogers from a specimen collected near Dowerin and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (radialis) is derived from the Latin word radius meaning \\"ray\\", \\"rod\\" or \\"spoke\\", referring to the radiating red lines on the labellum.  Distribution and habitat  The drooping spider orchid is found between the Fitzgerald River National Park and Northampton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in a range of habitats including on granite outcrops and near the edges of salt lakes.

The author was also a practitioner of kundalini yoga with the Simplified Kundalini Yoga Society in Singapore.  Early life  S. Jayaraman arrived in Singapore in 1949 without an ability to neither read nor write. He attended night classes to study English, Tamil and Tamil literature in the 1950s. His Tamil tutor was Murugu Seenivaasan from whom he studied Tamil literature and prose writing. He also took part-time courses at the Singapore Electronics Institute in the 1960s and build a radio as part of his practical assignments. He received a Diploma in Electronics from the then Member of Parliament for Anson Govindasamy. He married J. Rajamani in 1954 in India. S.

Villu Paatu (or 'Bow Song' as translated in English, Villu means Bow; Tamil: வில்லுப்பாட்டு) is an ancient form of musical story-telling where narration is interspersed with music, an art of South India. Simple tunes and simple verses make the story to be followed easily. The villu, a bow, the age-old weapon of warriors - paradoxically lends itself to be used as a primary musical instrument for the Villu Pattu artists. He also participated in an essay writing competition organised by the Kilang Thirukkural Association and won the first prize for an essay entitled \\"Thirukuralum Ghandhiyadigalum\\". In his free time, S. Jayaraman offered free classes to a group of 10 young and aspiring literary talents in Singapore on Thirukkural appreciation, some of whom who later rose to become prominent Tamil writers and poets in Singapore. S. Jayaraman's first book on yogic powers of the body was entitled \\"Manitha Udambil Maaberum Sakthi (Great Yogic Powers of the Human Body) in 1996.

Three IRA members killed six civilians and themselves in the explosion. The event was one of the bloodiest of 1972, the deadliest year of The Troubles.  Background  Since 1971, the Provisional IRA had been waging a campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Gun and bomb attacks became daily occurrences in the province as the campaign continued. In January 1972, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 civil rights protesters in Derry, in an event later known as Bloody Sunday. The attack enraged the nationalist community and as a result support for the IRA surged. In the following months the ferocity of the conflict, and as a result number of casualties, rose dramatically. Military installations and civilian businesses were targeted frequently. Civilians often fell victim to the IRA's attacks. This most prominently occurred on Bloody Friday, when at least 20 bombs planted by the IRA exploded in quick succession in Belfast. As a result of the bombs, 9 people were killed and another 130 injured. Newry, a mainly nationalist town near the Irish border, had a lot of IRA supporters.

It was developed by Mattis \\"machineboy\\" Folkestad and released on January 5, 2017. The game's plot features a Scandinavian milkmaid, Ruth, who loses her cows to a spacecraft, and has to jump aboard to save them. Plot The puzzle adventure game takes place in space and in 1920s Norway. The main character is Ruth, a milkmaid living alone with her cows on a farm in a Nordic fjord in the 1920s. The game's story begins with Ruth doing tasks and chores on her farm, longing for a different life after the mysterious disappearance of her mother and death of her father. Then a spaceship flies overhead and abducts her cows from a field. Ruth has to get on the wing of the ship as it flies away, and figures out how to get inside to rescue her friends the cows. Later gameplay involves an intergalactic feud involving an oppressive monarch, and other characters such as an oracle, and space cows. Gameplay The game is a point-and-click adventure game.” Players start by exploring the farm and surrounding area, encountering various challenges and puzzles. The game allows both running and walking speed. Early tasks include milking cows, patching the roof, making cheese, and also rescuing a lost cow. Puzzle solving is used to get through obstacles, not leveling up, and the skills learned in the first day are useful later on in the game. In between gameplay, there are also animated video clips to move the story along. On day two, the game becomes a science fiction venture concerning alien situations. When a spaceship abducts Ruth’s cows, Ruth has to get on the wing of the ship as it flies away and figure out how to get inside. Development The game was independently developed by Mattis \\"machineboy\\" Folkestad, a developer in Oslo, Norway. He got illustrator Natalie Foss to make the cover.Milkmaid of the Milky Way at Machinery’s website He worked on the project over two years, in his free time while also working a full-time job. The game was initially released for iOS. In January 2017, this was followed by a release for Steam (for Windows and Mac) and Apple’s Mac App Store. It only came out for Android on May 18, 2017. The soundtrack is available on iTunes. While the images are done in a pixelated style, the backgrounds are hand-painted with a pastel color palette. The game is completely written in rhyme, and is available in English, French, and Norwegian. Reception The Microsoft Windows version of the game was given a score of 74 out of 100 by Metacritic, a review aggregation website. Adventure Gamers praised its story, but complained about the rhyming and lack of hints, giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars overall. Stuff.tv gave it 4/5 stars, stating the script had moments like a Douglas Adams story, and the “entire project feels like a concise, modern take on a classic Lucasfilm game.” Gamezebo thought it was “charmingly retro.” iDigitalTimes gave it 5/5, saying that it was “already a strong contender for one of the best mobile games of 2017,” because of its “engaging storyline, beautiful graphics and clever gameplay.” Macworld thought that “everything about Milkmaid of the Milky Way has clearly been carefully designed, and the result is gorgeous.” Also, Pocket Gamer gave the game the “Pocket Game Silver Award.\\"Press for machineboy at the Machineboy.com website References 2017 video games Adventure games Android (operating system) games IOS games MacOS games Video games developed in Norway Video games featuring female protagonists Windows games ","title":"Milkmaid of the Milky Way"},{"id":"53426595","text":"Evren Korkmaz (born 27 April 1997) is a Turkish professional footballer who plays as a defender for Turkish club Adanaspor.

Since 1990, ha has always cast his vote to the party which could ensure the unity and rise of the Hungarians. Critical reception His poems are significant in his oeuvre: he combines verse and poetic prose. The coexistence of permanent avant-garde and modernised tradition is the novelty in his style. \\"Dante was the first who dared to write a poetic worldview on time on his own, the lyrical universes of Milton, Goethe, Madách, Ferenc Juhász also exist on the ontic plane.

Poéma, His drama trilogy presents existence philosophically: \\"Your dramas are large-scale, difficult to interpret. No-one has such dramatic technique, drama language together today. I tend to see the personalised reflections of Kleist’s and Brecht’s sense of the world in your works: strangely, these evidently opposite passions fit together well in your creative world.\\" (Tamás Tarján, literary historian, theater critic). He renews novel with the reg genre. His related works titled REN uniquely contextualise narratives, philosophical mosaics, speeches, dreams, lyrical and dramatic inserts, and more. \\"It was good to read REN. Hamvas and Krúdy came to my mind. And I saw the continuation of tradition in you book. The text is poetic and the presentation of the world delightfully delicate, mysterious.\\" (Róbert Barna, writer, translator) He uses revelation as a base genre, applies his specific association method in his travelogue; his essays fill some blank pages of not only literary history, but also of art history.

Bailey powder puff design, U.S. patent no. 471,680, 1892. Ellene Alice Bailey (1853 – July 22, 1897) was an American designer and inventor specializing in clothing and household goods. She patented over a dozen of her many inventions. Biography Ellene Alice Bailey was born in Pond Fort, just south of Wentzville, Missouri, the third daughter of Robert Bailey, a judge, and Lucinda (Zumwalt) Bailey. Early in her career, she moved to New York and built a business from manufacturing her own designs or selling them for outside manufacture. Bailey became a designer of clothing and household goods, as well as an inventor of practical devices. Her first design was the \\"Pond Fort boot\\", a close-fitting, knee-high boot that she patented in both the United States and Canada in 1880. Later clothing designs included a perforated felt chest protector, a sleeve holder, a waterproof leg protector, a detachable brassiere frame, and a corset shield. One of her early inventions was the \\"Dart\\" needle, first patented in 1884. She initially manufactured the Dart needle herself, making the first 60,000 on her own after the man she hired for the job absconded. She later had the needle manufactured by an outside firm. Other practical objects for the home included a holder for rubber overshoes, a manicure case, a photograph album, several clocks, ornamental tables, and a hand pinking device. A number of Bailey's inventions were novelty or seasonal goods, such as a silver whisk broom and a music roll sold as a Christmas card. On occasion, she improved designs originated by other inventors to make them salable. Bailey may have been the first American to patent a powder puff with her 1882 invention of a small drawstring cloth bag with a perforated bottom to distributed the powder evenly. She went on to invent three more variations on her powder puff, the last of them patented in 1892.

This saturation reaction is assisted by a FMN cofactor and the enzyme is a member of the a/ß-barrel flavoprotein family. The sequence of the enzyme has been obtained from bacteria Pseudomonas putida M10 and has been successfully expressed in yeast and other bacterial species. The enzyme is reported to harbor high sequence and structural similarity to the Old Yellow Enzyme, a large group of flavin- dependent redox biocatalysts of yeast species, and an oestrogen-binding protein of Candida albicans. The enzyme has demonstrated value in biosynthesis of semi-opiate drugs in microorganisms, expanding the chemical diversity of BIA biosynthesis.  Enzyme structure  Morphinone reductase is a dimeric flavoenzyme comprising two 8-fold a/ß-barrel domains, each with a non- covalently bound FMN prosthetic group located toward the center and C-terminal end of the barrel. At the active site, the Cys-191 residue serves as a proton donor in the oxidative half-reaction with a/ß unsaturated enones. Residues His-186 and Asn-189 are involved in ligand binding and they represent a conserved feature which is also observed in Old Yellow Enzymes. The residue Arg-238 contributes to a key interaction with the flavin as the side chain of this group is located close to the N-1/C-2 carbonyl region of the flavin isoalloxazine ring, stabilizing the negative charge developed during enzyme reduction. {style=\\"margin: 3 auto;\\"  3D structure of a morphinone reductase single subunit. The non-covalently bound FMN prosthetic group is shown in sticks. PDB ID: 1GWJ. Figure generated by PyMOL.  FMN prosthetic group and key residues at the active site of morphinone reductase. }  Enzyme catalysis  Morphinone reductase takes two substrates, namely morphinone and codeinone, and converts them to hydromorphone and hydrocodone respectively. The catalysis is part of the degradation pathway of morphine and codeine in Pseudomonas putida M10: morphine dehydrogenase and morphinone reductase together form a two-step catalysis converting morphine to hydromorphone, and codeine to hydrocondone. {style=\\"margin: 3 auto;\\"  Initial steps of the morphine degradation pathway in Pseudomonas putida M10.  A proposed reduction mechanism catalyzed by morphinone reductase. } The prosthetic group FMN serves as a cofactor in the redox reaction catalyzed by morphinone reductase. In the reduction of morphinone to hydromorphone, FMNH2 is oxidized to FMN which is then reduced by NADH (and H+) to regenerate FMNH2. Previous studies showed that NADPH could not be used as a reducing agent, which suggested the enzyme's specific toward NADH as a substrate. Studies have shown that the mechanism of flavin reduction in morphinone reductase involve the rapid formation of an E-NADHCT charge-transfer intermediate prior to FMN reduction. It was suggested that the enzyme adapts a two-step kinetic model where the oxidized enzyme (state A) undergoes an enzyme-coenzyme charge-transfer intermediate (state B) before regenerating the reduced form of FMN cofactor (state C). The reduction mechanism involves transfer of a hydride ion from the N5 atom of FMN to 2-cyclohexenone. The other proton donor for the saturation reaction remained uncertain. Steady-state kinetics experiments suggested that morphinone reductase may follow a hybrid two-site, ping-pong kinetic mechanism in which the alkaloid substrates, i.e. morphinone and codeinone, bind independently at separate sites and sequential redox reaction is facilitated by reducing equivalents passed between the binding sites by means of redox- active prosthetic groups, i.e. FMN.  Potential regulatory mechanism  The enzyme was shown to be highly similar to an oestrogen-binding protein from the fungus species Candida albicans, in which the binding of oestrogen prevents the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone. In addition, previous experimental characterization results suggested that morphinone reductase activity is competitively inhibited by progesterone and cortisone, which indicates that the regulatory mechanism of morphinone reductase could be related to its structural resemblance to the oestrogen-binding protein.  Industrial relevance  The enzyme yields hydromorphone and hydrocodone, which are both valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs. Hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic, which is shown to be more potent than morphine. Hydrocodone is a FDA-approved, mild analgesic and antitussive. Notably, morphine and codeine are natural products of the opiate biosynthetic pathway in opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum. Modern technologies in genetic engineering and metabolic engineering enabled the production of these natural products in microorganisms. Complete biosynthesis of opiate compounds has been achieved in genetically tractable organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Morphinone reductase was also successfully expressed in these two organisms. The enzyme represents a promising candidate for downstream modifications of opiate compounds, allowing the biosynthesis of valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs in microorganisms. As an example, morphinone reductase was used as part of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of hydrocodone in yeast.

Life  Sophia was a daughter of Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels (1649-1697) by his first wife Johanna Magdalena of Saxe-Altenburg (1656-1686), daughter of Frederick William II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. This made her a princess of Saxe-Weissenfels and a member of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin. In Leipzig on 16 October 1699 Sophia herself married George William, Margrave of Brandenburg- Bayreuth (1678-1726), who she had met during a visit to the Leipzig Fair earlier the same year. She thus became margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Soon afterwards he founded his own court, giving him the opportunity to build the Schloss Erlangen. Sophia had considerable influence on cultural life in Bayreuth, which was described as the finest venue for singspiel in Germany. Hans Joachim Bauer: Barockoper in Bayreuth, Laaber 1982, S. 5 Sophia brought her love for German-language opera to Weissenfels, making it the only theatre which exclusively showed German-language works. However, her spending on festivities and culture increased the state's debt. In 1705 the foundation stone was laid for a new church in the St. Georgen district of the city - it was dedicated to Hagia Sophia after her. Sophia was described as superficial, and her marriage proved unhappy. Her dalliance with a Swedish baron irritated George William that he attacked the baron at table with a stick and had his wife taken to Plassenburg. Historischer Verein für Oberfranken zu Bayreuth: Archiv für Geschichte von Oberfranken, Band 5-6, S. 12 After her husband's death, she moved to Schloss Erlangen, where she lived for 8 years.

To marry him Sophia converted to Catholicism and as a result she was granted an annual pension from the imperial court in Vienna.

Influenced by house music, Detroit techno, and disco, she released several recordings on the independent dance music label 100% Silk, including Queen of Cups, Far Away So Close, and Memory of Water, reissued in 2017. KQED named Cherushii's album Meow Wolf’s Arcade Soundtracks: Wiggy’s Plasma Plex one of the 10 best Bay Area albums of 2016. Fellow electronic musician Maria Minerva has called Cherushii \\"criminally underrated\\". Dolan was one of 36 victims of a fire that broke out at an underground venue and artist collective in Oakland, California commonly referred to as the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016. Biography Cherushii was born Chelsea Faith Dolan on September 14, 1983. She grew up in Marin County, California and began playing music around the age of 6, when she was gifted a Casio keyboard. She was classically trained at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music as a teenager. After years of written correspondence with Japanese pen pals Chelsea traveled to Japan, where she adopted the moniker Cherushii because it was easier to pronounce than her name. Her introduction to electronic music at raves in the early 2000s set the path for her career as an electronic musician. Cherushii was a champion of women in electronic music and recognized their contributions as a source of influence in a field that often lacks recognition for women. In an interview with Chicago's Reader about the influence of Detroit DJ and producer Kelli Hand (aka K-Hand) Cherushii said \\"I deeply admire her for all the work she's done, and yet her lack of recognition is so discouraging. In a culture as supposedly forward-thinking as electronic music, women are still so often invisible.\\" From January 2014 to December 2016 Cherushii was host of radio shows on UC Berkeley's community radio station KALX, where she devoted sets to Italo Disco, Detroit techno, or contemporaries in the local electronic music scene such as David Last and Roche. In August 2015 Cherushii co-founded a dance music night called Run the Length of Your Wildness to provide a space for local electronic musicians to showcase their music. =Death= Cherushii was scheduled to perform at the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016 as part of fellow music producer Golden Donna's (Joel Shanahan) tour. At approximately 11:20 pm a fire started inside the warehouse, trapping attendees inside. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau confirmed 36 people trapped inside, including Cherushii, died of smoke inhalation. A public memorial was held on December 17, 2016 at Public Works in San Francisco. Music In 2013 Cherushii signed with 100% Silk and released Queen of Cups, a four track album described as an \\"expansive blueprint of slow-burn deep house but threads it through with waves of synth wash, acid flash, and simmering strobe glow, for a loose yet composed suite of 21st-century free-spirit pulse generation.\\" In 2015 Cherushii released Starlight Express, Nobody's Fool, and Far Away So Close, 3 EPs. In 2016 Cherushii released Manic. After Cherushii's death 100% Silk released a memorial edition tape of Memory of Water, previously out of print. =Gear= Cherushii opted for hardware analog gear at a time when laptops were transforming electronic music production and was known to carry heavy suitcases full of equipment to her shows. She used a Yamaha RS7000 before advancing onto the Elektron Octatrack of which she was quoted as saying: \\"Like most Elektron gear, learning to play it is an ongoing journey that you definitely won't complete in the first few months. But its ability to sequence both audio and MIDI makes it a great machine for live sets, and you can't beat its compact size for travel.\\" Cherushii also used the compact Access Virus TI,a digital multitimbral polyphonic synth. Among her gear was also a hand built and highly modified X0xb0x (analog Roland TB-303 hardware clone), which she received as a gift from fellow musicians.

History The property that Pacific Shores Center was developed on had many uses through the years from part of the Redwood City Harbor Company to cement production to being part of saltworks with Leslie Salt. In the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois bought of land adjacent to the Port of Redwood City and Westpoint Slough and formed the Pacific Shores Center Partnership to develop it. After many years of planning Redwood City and the partnership had a complete development agreement with plans for a land swap, that decreased the total property to , and public shore space to allow for public use of parts of the property. In Jay Paul Company entered into an agreement to buy the rights for the project by outbidding several other competing developers with a bid. By early 2000 with the buildings not even complete; Excite@Home, Phone.com, Informatica Corp, and BroadVision Inc. had all signed leases. Demand at the time caused rent prices to increase for the center as well. At this time there were plans for a ferry service to connect San Francisco and Alameda, California to an adjacent ferry terminal to mitigate traffic concerns at the time with so many of the expected workers to be projected commuting. By the burst of the Dot-com bubble had decreased demand for office space and the center previously estimated to fill completely was sitting with a vacancy rate of 65%. However fortunes changed and in late 2006 the campus was sold from Jay Paul to Starwood Capital Group for over for the center which had hit 90% capacity. Tenants at the time included Eidos Interactive, PDL BioPharma, DreamWorks Animation, Threshold Pharmaceutical, Openwave, Symantec, and engineering firm Rudolph and Sletten. The following year two of the buildings, specifically the ones PDL BioPharma was located within, were sold to Shorenstein Properties for an undisclosed sum, for the first time making Pacific Shores Center to have more than one owner. San Mateo County filed a lawsuit in August 2009 over a tax dispute with the Center. County officials claimed that the sale of property in 2006 never had the property transfer taxes paid while the Center argued over the county tax code. Starwood Capital ran into issues with overdue debt in and brought in Blackstone with an ownership stake. Starwood also sold off two of the buildings at the complex to Informatica for . In , Google bought the six buildings, over half the center, at of office space, which Starwood and Blackstone owned, for . Shortly after Google's purchase, Shorenstein Properties sold the two buildings they owned to DivcoWest Properties for about . This has left Pacific Shores Center with fragmented ownership to this day with the three owners all with different sections. Other Pacific Shores Center is used more than just as an area for work. The facilities present include a fitness center that includes a gym, pool, and spa along with playing fields. Public shore access allows for people to park and walk along the Westpoint Slough on a section of the San Francisco Bay Trail. The annual Stanford University Treeathlon triathlon competition is hosted in part at the center along with the Westpoint Harbor.

Early life Pomeroy was born in Astoria, Oregon, and later moved with his parents to the state of Washington. He received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Washington in 1927 where he was a founding member of the Sigma Pi fraternity chapter. He earned his law degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1931. He married Loretta Tyler and they had a daughter, Paula Pomeroy LeFavor, and a son, Allan Merritt Pomeroy. After graduating from law school, Pomeroy became a practicing lawyer. He eventually became a judge and public servant, serving as Justice of the Peace in Kitsap County (1934-1936), acting Seattle municipal judge (1942), assistant United States Attorney for Western Washington (1942-1948), and King County Superior Court judge (1948). Mayor In 1948, Pomeroy was defeated by a slim margin in his first bid for the mayor's office by incumbent Mayor William F. Devin. The defining issue of the election had been Devin's Tolerance Policy where small time gambling was tolerated. Devin (and Police Chief Eastman) said this was the best deterrent to major vice and police corruption. Pomeroy said this was an official acceptance of illegality. He promised to end the practice and get rid of Eastman. This promise led to enough voters switching sides for Pomeroy to win the 1952 election by a small margin. He named H.J. Lawrence as Police Chief and said that card rooms would no longer be permitted. Pomeroy was credited with making Seattle a well known city by bringing the World's Fair to the city in 1962. Pomeroy had to bring in community and business leaders, as well as a petition campaign, to convince the city council to approve an $8.5 million bond issue to build the opera house and sports center needed to attract the fair. Eventually the council approved a $7.5 million bond issue with the state matching that amount. In 1952, Pomeroy cut the ribbon opening the Alaskan Way Viaduct. In April 1954, during the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic police in the Seattle area were swamped with calls of car windshields being pitted. Close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as being pitted, and no one knew what to do. Under pressure, Pomeroy first wired Washington Governor Arthur B. Langlie, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking for assistance. Many theories were put forth for the cause of the damage but an investigation by the Seattle Police Department determined that most of the damage was to the windshields of older cars. In cases were auto lots were involved, brand new cars were unpitted; used cars were. The damage had been there all along, it had just gone unnoticed. Sergeant Max Allison of the Seattle Police crime laboratory declared that all the damage reports were \\"5 percent hoodlum-ism, and 95 percent public hysteria.\\" Area residents had become participants in a collective delusion. Within a couple of days reports of damage had ceased. In 1955, Pomeroy appointed the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Police Practices to investigate charges of police brutality. The committee condemned police practices in the predominantly black Central District neighborhood. As a result, a program was started to improve police relations with the black community. Several police officers participated in intercultural workshops sponsored by the Seattle Public Schools and others were enrolled in race relations classes at Seattle University. The effectiveness of the program was questioned by many. In 1956 Pomeroy lost his re-election bid to Gordon S. Clinton. Pomeroy and Police Chief Lawrence's inability to close down the card rooms were a major reason for Clinton's victory. The ousting of an incumbent mayor is rare in Seattle. It wouldn't happen again until Greg Nickels beat Paul Schell in 2001. After politics After losing the mayor's race Pomeroy went back to practicing law. At the time of his death he was a senior partner in the law firm of Pomeroy, Zelensky, Furnia, and Munro. He was a member of several clubs and societies, including the Moose Lodge, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Kiwanis Club, the Sons of Norway and the Alaska-Yukon Pioneers. He also served as Exalted Ruler of the Seattle Elks. He died on July 7, 1966, of a heart attack in his Seattle home, at the age of 59.

The buildings are late 17th century although the institution developed from an earlier Augustinian community. The chapel was completed by 1671, date in which it was consecrated; and in 1677, year of the death of the convent's patron Cardinal Don Pascual de Aragón, the works of the conventual dependences were practically finished.  Description of church  Although the church's crossing, in its lateral development, protrudes slightly in floor, the plan cannot be described as a Latin cross, it is essentially rectangular with a single nave divided in three sections: the crossing, the greater chapel and the choir, high, at the feet, on a wide lowered arch. The nave and the main chapel have half-barrel vaulted ceilings and lunettes; In the transept, dome on pechinas (pendentives), without drum and with blind lantern. On a base of ashlar masonry, there is a limpid and undeveloped interior elevation, articulated by Tuscan pilasters that, extended on the smooth frieze, reach the capitals located directly under the cornices. Four buttresses support the dome in the crossing. Regarding this, the presbytery is slightly elevated, where the pilasters of articulation appear subtly boxed; On its front, the main altarpiece; On the side of the epistle, the fence that gives to the low choir of the nuns - wide rectangular stay and of low height, whose low ceiling is materially occupied by an enormous shield, frescoed by Francisco Rizi, of the Cardinal Pascual de Aragón, and on the gospel side, the chapel of the Christ. Fine simplicity and marked desornamentation are the criteria handled throughout the interior. The counterpart is in the nobility of materials - marble, jaspers and bronzes - used for altarpieces, picture frames and plaques with inscriptions. Each of the details that configure this architectural space is executed with a weighting, exquisiteness and a final finish that surprise; Fruit, all of it, of a measured proportion and balance. The exterior is, in general, of brick seen with rafters of stone, of cubic volumes and rectilinear profiles, as is customary in the 17th-century architecture of Toledo.  Other buildings  Among the conventual dependences is to note the small cloister, which acts as a distributing element of rooms, formed by two floors, four galleries each, which, through arches of half a point, open to a courtyard.  Paintings  The walls of the nave are decorated with paintings by Simón de León Leal, which represents Ferdinand III the Saint before Saint Hermenegild (1670), and of Carlo Francesco Nuvolone (before 1646), represents the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\", Giovanni Peruzzini, Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis, and Giacinto Giminiani, Apparition of the Child to Santa Rosa de Lima, both signed in 1670.Nicolau Castro, Juan, \\"A work signed by the Madrilenian painter Simón León de Leal and details of other paintings in Toledo\\", \\"Bulletin of the Seminar of Studies in Art and Archeology\\", t. 58, 1992, pp. 425-430.

She completed twenty-five murals and seven sculptures throughout Chicago, as part of the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Later, she completed seventeen ceramic murals for the 3rd Unitarian Church, which was designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1960. In addition to her artwork and exhibitions, Kauffman taught art for forty-one years at various universities in Chicago, Rockford, Illinois and Valparaiso, Indiana. Early life Camille Andrene Kauffman was born on April 19, 1905 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois to Charlotte Camille (née Henriksen) and George Francis Kauffman Kauffman came from an artistic family. Her father was a dress designer and her paternal grandfather, Francis Xavier Kauffman designed furniture. Her brother G. Francis would become a cartoonist and illustrator. She attended Austin Community Academy High School of Chicago before entering the Art Institute of Chicago, graduating in 1926 and winning the John Quincy Adams Fellowship from the Institute for a year of continued study abroad. In 1927, Kauffman went to Paris, where she studied with André Lhote and traveled throughout Europe, before returning in 1928 to take up a teaching post at Valparaiso University. Career Kauffman was hired as a professor of Painting and drawing at the Art Institute of Chicago upon her return and simultaneously worked instructing art at Valparaiso University. Both assignments were part time and in 1933, when she was approached by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), she joined the federal program. During her time with the WPA, Kauffman produced over 50 easel paintings, 25 murals and 7 sculpture projects earning $24.50 per week. Some of her first works for the WPA were murals painted for the Brookfield Zoo, which was under construction at the time. Between 1936 and 1940, Kauffman painted four murals for the cafeteria of the Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School including Amusement Park, Circus, Rodeo, and Stock Show The murals were painted over with housepaint, but the outlines of the canvases are visible on the walls and might be able to be restored. In 1937, Kauffman painted Incidents in the Life of Luther Burbank for the Luther Burbank School. The following year, she completed a second mural at the school, Circus. The murals at Burbank were still extant in 2001. The playground houses at Oak Park, Illinois contain Kaufman's bas relief sculptures depicting fairy tales. These included a cast stone relief based on Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen, at the Watts Playground on Hayes Avenue at Division Street; a stone sculpture titled The Cutting of the Cake based on Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, for the Lincoln Playground at Kenilworth Avenue and Fillmore Street; and a cast stone work Captain Flint based on Robert Louis Stevenson's character at the Pyott Playground on Lake Street at Taylor Avenue. She painted murals at the Cook County Children's Hospital, but they were destroyed when the building was demolished. Kauffman created two bas reliefs for the Lincoln Elementary School in Evanston, Illinois. Children in Fruit Tree and Monkeys are intricate wood carvings with three-dimensional style. In addition, she completed commissions at the Washington School in Evanston and the Lowell School in Oak Park, as well as a mural for the Forest Park Public Library. In 1940, Kauffman won the federal commission to paint Preparation for the First County Fair in Ida Grove–1872 for the post office mural in Ida Grove, Iowa. During her time with the WPA project, Kauffman earned her bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in 1939 and completed her Master of Fine Arts in 1941. In 1943, when the WPA project ended, Kauffman resigned her teaching post at Valparaiso University and took a position as an aircraft engineering drafter in a war plant. When the war ended, she returned to teaching, taking a position at Rockford College as the chair of the art department, while still teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1947, she designed the Jane Addams medal for Rockford to be awarded to students for distinguished service. Taking a sabbatical to study ceramics in 1951 at the Art Institute, she returned as an associate professor to Rockford in 1952. She completed two ceramic murals that year, Deduction and Induction, which were installed on either side of the entrance of the new science building at the university. In 1955, Kauffman began a series of seventeen murals for the Third Unitarian Church, for which she also designed a large stained glass window, which is the dominant feature of the south wall of the building. The first ceramic tile portrait was of Woodrow Wilson and was unveiled as part of the centennial celebrations for Wilson's birth. The last portrait was of Roger Williams and was completed in 1963. Kauffman retired in 1967 from the Art Institute, but continued working and exhibiting her works. She held a one-woman show at the Vanderpoel Art Gallery in 1971, painted a mural for the Viola Gitzel Memorial Addition to the Forest Park Library in 1972, and was part of a three-artist exhibit at Loyola University in 1985. One of her works was chosen in 1990 from a state-wide competition, to hang in Chicago's State of Illinois Building. Death and legacy Kauffman died on July 4, 1993 in Chicago. Throughout her lifetime, her works were exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, Riverside Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, as well as at numerous galleries in Chicago. The Third Unitarian Church of Chicago, known as the \\"church of the murals\\" because of Kauffman's artwork has been designated a Chicago architectural landmark. Photographs of the murals were displayed in New York and at an exhibit hosted by the U.S. National Society of Mural Painters in Moscow, at the College of Industrial and Applied Arts.

Work was initially led by Antonio della Porta and after his death in 1702 by Gottfried von Gedeler. It was the first baroque building built from scratch in Franconia. Christian Ernst moved his third wife Margravine Elisabeth Sophie of Brandenburg into the Schloss in 1703 when it was still incomplete, giving it its initial name, the Elisabethenburg. Behind it was a 280 metre wide and 550 metre long garden with an orangery (completed in 1706), the Konkordienkirche (completed in 1706, now the Geological Institute), the Hugenottenbrunnen fountain, an equestrian statue and a now-lost Sylvan theater. After a short time as a princely residence, the castle served as a widow's residence until the early 19th century. It suffered several fires in the 18th century and on 14 January 1814 a final serious fire broke out in a roof space filled with rubbish - it could not be extinguished since the temperature was -25 ° C and the water froze in the hoses and even once the water had been heated the syringes could not pump it high enough. The castle was completely destroyed and only its furniture was saved. It was only rebuilt between 1821 and 1825, to plans by the university architect Friedrich Wilhelm Örtel with much flatter rooves than the original structure, and used to house the library of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität.

This species is endemic to Kenya, and grows in along roads and other open treaded places in the forest zones the central highlands of Kenya.  Taxonomy  In 1902, Spencer Le Marchant Moore was the first to describe this species of sunfleck as Coreopsis jacksonii, based on a specimen collected by Frederick John Jackson from the Kiambu County in Kenya in 1899. John Hutchinson assigned a plant collected by Battiscombe from the Aberdare Range in Nyandarua County to the genus Guizotia and called it G. reptans. Earl Edward Sherff described in 1923 a plant from the western slopes of Mount Kenya, found by Mearns, as Bidens spathulata. By 1926 he had realised it was identical to Moore's species, but as he thought it better placed in Bidens, he made the new combination B. jacksonii. Robert Elias Fries collected a slightly different specimen in 1928 that he called Guizotia reptans var. keniensis, while Sherff also had a plant he regarded as sufficiently divergent and called it Coreopsis jacksonii var. arthrochaeta in 1929. It wasn't until 1974 that J. Baagøe synonymised all of these names, and had to create the new combination Guizotia jacksonii to satisfy the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. cited on  Description  Guizotia jacksonii is a low (about 1 cm high) perennial, herbaceous, creeping plant, which branches sparingly, each hairless stem 3–30 cm long, that makes roots at the nodes and sometimes forms clumps. The leaves are set opposite along the stem and may be unequal to each other, lacking a leaf stalk, oval in shape 1–6¼ cm long and ½–2½ cm wide, merged at the narrowed foot with the opposing leaf. The edge of the leaf has distanced and very small teeth ending in a gland, and are often rolled back. There may be some hairs on the leaf or only on the veins. The flowerheads sit individually in the axil of the leaves near the tip and stand on a stalk of ½–3 cm long. The involucre is ¾–1¼ cm long, the individual bract with a row of hairs along the rim. The scales (or paleas) set on the common base of the florets (called receptacle) at the foot of each floret are yellowish and up to 3 mm long. Each flowerhead has four to nine yellow ray florets on the outside with a tube of 2 mm long, and a strap of ¾–1½ cm long, tipped with three teeth. In the middle are seven to thirteen disc florets, each 3¾–5 mm long. The ripe indehiscent and one-seeded fruits (called cypselas) are brown in color and 3½ mm long. There is no hairy or scaly pappus present. The species has thirty chromosomes (2n=30).  Distribution  Guizotia jacksonii is an endemic of Mount Elgon, Cherangani Hills Forest, the Aberdare Range, Mau Forest and Mount Kenya, where it occurs between 2350–3900 m altitude.

Logging historians, such as Stewart Holbrook, Robert Pike, and others, have called him \\"the last lumberjack\\" of the old-fashioned type who \\"cut a swath of timber from Maine to Oregon\\" and \\"yelled like crazy devils every spring when they pounded the bars in Bangor, Saginaw, St. Paul, and Seattle\\". The U.S. Forest Service maintains the Jigger Johnson Campground in the White Mountain National Forest, which they named in honor of him. Early life Albert \\"Jigger\\" Johnson was born on May 12, 1871, in Fryeburg, Maine to parents of Yankee stock. According to legend, when Jigger was born he came out of his mother's womb with a wad of tobacco in his lip, caulk boots on his feet, and a peavey in one hand and an axe in the other.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Another legend states that he only had two formal days of schooling. On the first day, the Jigger forgot his books, and on the second day the teacher was out sick. At the young age of 12, he went to work in the woods as a \\"cookee\\", or cook's assistant, at a lumber camp in Milan, New Hampshire. Jigger's duties as cookee required him to help the cook prepare food, serve the loggers their meals, clean the dishes after mealtime, and to chop fire wood during any spare time. During meals, it was forbidden for the loggers to converse with one another, due to it interfering with the cook and cookee's job. One evening, a few newcomers decided to talk during dinner, and continued to talk after the young Jigger politely asked them to stop. One logger started arguing with the boy Jigger, and the next thing the loggers knew was that the youth had jumped onto the fully grown man and sunk his teeth into his ear. After the other men separated the two, part of the man's ear remained in Jigger's mouth.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. The other loggers were so impressed that a young boy would even attempt to take on a fully grown man that they all combined a portion of their wages and bought the Jigger a can of chewing tobacco.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Later loggers would say that because of this, men who fought Jigger would never caulk his face, from fear of his teeth. Logging career The young Jigger soon worked his way up the ranks in the woods - swamping roads, tending landing, and chopping, to eventually emerge at the age of 20 as head chopper in charge of a logging camp somewheres on the Androscoggin River. Old loggers who worked for him, such as Stewart Holbrook, claimed that Johnson had few equals as a woodsman at a time when a man working in the woods was judged by the smoothness of the scarf of his axe’s undercut. They said that the Jigger was an unusually good logger and that he could fell a tree uphill, downhill, with or against the wind, even so that upon falling it would drive a stake previously set in the ground. Johnson worked for many years as a logging foreman in the woods of Coös County, New Hampshire for the Connecticut Valley Lumber Company (C.V.L) in the winter, and as a river boss on the Connecticut River in the spring. Robert E. Pike claimed in his 1967 book, Tall Trees, Tough Men, that whenever Jigger entered the camp of a new logging operation, for his resume he would exclaim, \\"I can jump higher, squat lower, turn sideways quicker, and spit further than any son-of-a-bitch in a camp.\\"Pike, Robert E. (1967). Tall Trees, Tough Men, W. W. Norton & Company, New York. . As a foreman, Jigger was known to have kicked off the knots of a frozen hemlock log barefooted, and supposedly wouldn't hire anyone else who couldn't do the same.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. He was well known to be an honest, hardworking boss, who would pay his men high wages to work for him. He would walk into saloons at Berlin, New Hampshire and Sherbrooke, Quebec and could convince drunken loggers to work for him driving logs down the most dangerous parts of the Connecticut River.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Although he paid his men handsomely, he expected a lot from them. On one occasion during a river drive, Jigger told his men to wait at camp while he went to recruit more log drivers in West Stewartstown, New Hampshire. Some of his workers disobeyed his orders and went down to the Line House on the Beecher Falls–East Hereford Border Crossing.Holbrook, Stewart (1961). Yankee Loggers: A Recollection of Woodsmen, Cooks, and River Drivers, The International Paper Company, New York. . Once he returned to camp, Jigger realized at once where the missing men had gone and immediately left for the Line House. Upon entering the Line House, the Jigger grabbed a peavey that was hung on the wall, and ran into the crowd swinging. The bouncer, a bulky French-Canadian by the name of Lapointe, then knocked Johnson to the ground and began stomping him with his cork boots. Jigger managed to grab a hold of Lapointe's feet and lifted him up and placed him onto a hot wood stove and held him there for a few minutes, all the while Lapointe bellowed.Pike, Robert E. (1959). Spiked Boots: Sketches of the North County, W. W. Norton & Company, New York. . When Jigger finally let up, he proceeded to jump into the air and grabbed a hold of a kerosene lamp from the ceiling and smashed it over the bouncer's head. The kerosene met the heat and ignited Lapointe's clothes. Lapointe ran outside, still ablaze, and had to be put out by bystanders, while Jigger's frightened men returned to camp. In his younger years, Jigger Johnson boasted that he would not leave any tree standing from Bangor to Seattle, nor any virgins.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . He trekked from New England all the way to the Great Lakes States and then to the great pine forests of the Southeast,Robins, William. \\"Jigger Jones\\", Lumberjacks and Legislators, Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, Texas, December, 1982. before deciding to turn back to New England due to a sprained ankle and stomach problems.Oregon Department of Forestry. Forest Log, Oregon Department of Forestry, Salem, Oregon, 1931. Johnson worked on the Connecticut River for the C.V.L. until 1915, when the last long-log drive occurred. He then continued to work for the remainder of his logging career on the Androscoggin River. Sensing that the long-log drives were coming to an end, Jigger retired from working in the woods in the early 1920s.  Fire warden and the Civilian Conservation Corps Shortly after the end of his logging career, Jigger Johnson found a profession as a fire warden for the United States Forest Service and was stationed at their lookout tower on Mount Chocorua, and later at Carter Dome.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. It was there that Johnson, when sober, looked for forest fires. On days when he drank, mostly when the weather was rainy, he clogged up the telephone lines with reports of bizarre snakes and small dragons,Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. .Langlois, D. \\"Coffee Grounds\\", Dappled Grass, Concord, New Hampshire, 2006. a rare condition caused by extreme alcohol abuse known as alcoholic hallucinosis. On one occasion while the Jigger worked on Carter Dome, he and a friend, Robert Monahan, set off from \\"The Dome\\" to Berlin to replenish his potato supply and to stock up on bootlegged hard liquor.Burbank, Rob. \\"Fire Towers of Old\\", The Mountain Ear newspaper, Salmon Press, Wolfeboro Falls, New Hampshire, 1988. When they reached the town of Gorham, they stumbled upon a celebration that included a potato race. Bob and Jigger banded together and won the race, with the prize being a half-bushel of fresh potatoes. He and Monahan then lugged the sack of potatoes up to Carter Dome, where the two men had a feast.Monahan, Robert. \\"The Jigger\\", Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, 1975. After the U.S. Forest Service was forced to let him go due to his drinking, Johnson was hired to man a privately owned fire tower on Bald Mountain in Maine. However, this job did not last too long due to a conflagration that burnt down the tower, which was caused by one of Jigger's homemade alcohol stills exploding.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . After this, Jigger was hired to teach survival skills for the Civilian Conservation Corps in Gilead, Maine.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . It is there that the Jigger entranced the young men with his tales of old. The CCC, like the Forest Service, was forced to relieve him because of his heavy alcohol consumption, which forced the Jigger into finally deciding to go into self- employment as a trapper of wild game. Trapper Jigger's final job before his death was fur trapping. He erected a crude cabin in the White Mountain National Forest near Douglas Brook in Albany, New Hampshire. As a trapper, Johnson was known to have been somewhat of a one-man Hudson's Bay Company, catching lynx, bobcat, mink, muskrat, weasel, fox, and fisher, often alive and with nothing but his own hands.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. Once, the Jigger used a deer carcass to lure two bobcats under a tree that he had climbed. While the bobcats were having their feast, Johnson pounced on them and bagged them, live, barehanded. One of these cats was sold to the University of New Hampshire, which wanted a wildcat for use as a mascot, for the sum of $50. On another occasion, a man from Portland, Maine asked the Jigger if he could catch him two bobcats for a show he was doing, and if he could, he would pay him $25. Jigger agreed, and captured two bobcats and tied their feet together and started out for the train station, occasionally hitting their heads together to keep them quiet. Johnson asked the stationmaster how much it would cost to ship the cats to Portland, and after about ten minutes, the stationmaster revealed to Jigger that there wasn't any tariff on shipping bobcats, thus he could not ship them. Johnson ended up hiring a taxi driver to drive him to Portland, and he hand delivered the cats himself. Death After selling a lynx pelt for the sum of $100, the Jigger went to the town of Conway to celebrate. The next morning, after realizing he had not checked his traps in over 24 hours (as state laws required), Johnson hired a man to drive him back to Passaconaway. The car ended up sliding off the road just as the Jigger was about to get out of the car, pinning him to a tree. Jigger was taken to the Memorial Hospital in Conway, where he died on March 30, 1935. Legacy Following his death, Jigger Johnson was made famous by writers, such as Stewart Holbrook and Robert Pike, for his extraordinary intuition, tolerance to cold weather, ability to consume massive amounts of any proof alcohol, and his enormous strength.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. It is through the recounting of the Jigger's numerous off-the-job exploits by these historians that the Jigger has become somewhat of an American folk hero.Appalachia Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964. In the 1940 Warner Brothers film King of the Lumberjacks, there is a character played by Joe Sawyer named \\"Jigger\\", who is loosely based on Jigger Johnson. In 1969, the United States Forest Service opened the Jigger Johnson Campground in the White Mountain National Forest, near where the Jigger once trapped, which they named in his honor.

Marianne Nicolson (‘Tayagila’ogwa; born 1969) is a Dzawada’enuxw visual artist whose work explores the margins at which public access to First Nations artifacts clashes with the preservation of indigenous cultural knowledge. Born in Comox, British Columbia, she was trained by a master carver in traditional Kwakwaka’wakw design in the early 1990s. She utilizes painting, photography, mixed-media, sculpture, and installation to create modern depictions of traditional Kwakwaka’wakw beliefs, and has exhibited in Canada and throughout the world since 1992.  Personal life  Marianne Nicolson was born in 1969, in Comox, British Columbia to a Kwakwaka'wakw First Nations mother of the Dzawada'enuxw descent, and a Scottish immigrant father from Stornoway. She decided to become an artist when she was five years old. Nicolson is an outspoken advocate for Indigenous land rights, and integrates this in her artwork. Nicolson is involved in her community, both as a Nunwakola Cultural Society board member and through artistic projects. One community project in 2019 gathered over 55 participants, young and old, connected to the Musgamakw Dzawada’enuxw (part of the Kwakwaka’wakw First Nations). As part of a fish farming protest, Nicolson and the participants created a pictograph series. These pictographs were not only community building but they also played off her cliff painting from 1998. She currently lives in the Kwakwaka’wakw community of Kingcome Inlet, BC (Dzawada’enuxw people), after moving there in the 1990s.  Education  In 1996, Nicolson graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. She continued her education at the University of Victoria (UVIC) in 1999, receiving her Master of Fine Arts. In 2005, after returning to UVIC, she graduated with a Masters in Linguistics and Anthropology. Later on, she received her PhD in Anthropology and Art History, also from UVIC. She also studied the Kwak’wala language and directed research investigating the link between indigenous language and indigenous worldview.  Awards  * Emily Award- In 2019 Nicolson received Emily Carr University's Emily Award, which honours outstanding achievements by university alumni. * Fulmer Award of Distinction- She also received the Fulmer Award of Distinction in 2019. An award that recognizes individuals who have made a profound contribution to their First Nations culture.  Artistic career  Her practice is multi-disciplinary encompassing photography, painting, carving, video, installation, monumental public art, writing and speaking. All her work is political in nature and seeks to uphold Kwakwaka’wakw traditional philosophy and worldview through contemporary mediums and technology. Marianne Nicolson has exhibited in many countries. Such galleries and exhibitions include the 17th Biennale of Sydney, The Vancouver Art Gallery, The National Museum of the American Indian, Nuit Blanche in Toronto, Museum Arnhem and many others. Major monumental public artworks are situated in Vancouver International Airport, the Canadian Embassy in Amman, Jordan and the Canadian Embassy in Paris, France. = Cliff Painting = Marianne Nicolson's artistic career was established after the completion of her Cliff Painting in her traditional homeland of Kingcome Inlet in 1998. The pictograph, which covers a surface of 28 by 38 foot on 120 foot cliff makes reference to the history of the Dzawada‘enuxw tribe of the Kwakwaka’wakw First Nations. It is the first mural to be completed in sixty years, celebrating the strength of her community of Gwa’yi. A copper design represents wealth, and the Kawadilikala, the Dzawada'enuxw ancestor is also depicted while carrying a treasure box with the sun on it.  Major Exhibitions  =Bax'wana'tsi - The Container for Souls= This instillation was held at Artspeak, in Vancouver, BC from January 7 to February 11, 2006 and later held from October 19 to November 18, 2006 at Gallery 101, in Ottawa, ON. Nicolson's piece, a light box that casts shadows on the surrounding walls of a raven, owl and two girls — the artist's aunt and mother as young women, took up the entire gallery. Viewers become part of the work and part of the history it tells. The box holds the possibility for purification and healing for a landscape ravaged by the visitor, carrying the memories of Aboriginal life and community. = The House of the Ghosts = Nicolson transformed the Vancouver Art Gallery into a Northwest Coast Ceremonial House for the exhibition. This site-specific projection ran from October 4th to January 11th, 2009. The gallery used to be a former Provincial courthouse, through this piece Nicolson gives hope to the survival of Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations cultures and communities, despite active efforts to suppress and eradicate them. =Walking on Water (Thin Ice)= Exhibited at Equinox Gallery from April 6th to May 4th 2013, Nicolson's sculptural installation Walking on Water (Thin Ice) features a myriad of blue glass sculptures inserted into wooden supports. These glass shapes take the form of killer whale fins which, in Kwakwaka’wakw tradition, signify healing. Other Northwest Coast symbols are featured, such as owls, which carry the spirits of the deceased according to Kwakwaka’wakw principles, and also are becoming extinct as a result of habitat loss. The installation addresses issues of global warming through responding to a devastating flood that occurred in Kingcome Inlet. The title Walking on Water (Thin Ice) touches on this, inferring collective social denial and the repercussions they will inevitably face. =A Precarious State= This major installation consisted of a 6'x35' lit blue glass wall, which bears the carved image of a sinking killer whale being ridden by figures. The whale looks strained and it is not clear whether the figures are the source of the whale drowning or if they are drowning with the whale.This installation was commissioned by the Canadian Embassy in Amman, Jordan, in 2013 = Foolmakers in the Setting Sun (Ni’nułamgila le’e Banistida \`Tłisala) = Foolmakers in the Setting Sun (Ni’nułamgila le’e Banistida\`Tłisala), exhibited in 2014 at Gallery 2 in Grand Forks, British Columbia, depicts the dan\`tsikw (powerboards) that serve as spiritual powers during the 'tukwid, a traditional Kwakwaka’wakw ritual. Illustrations of a ghost and two nułamgila (foolmakers) are carved onto the three glass boards. Light is sent off onto the boards, simulating the sunset, producing shadows of the carved ghosts, which grow taller until they pass through an image of the Alberta Tar Sands on the wall at dusk. Foolmakers in the Setting Sun addresses how global warming and environmental contamination as a result of the pipeline project would destroy the planet, through the Kwakwaka’wakw worldview =The Rivers Monument= Her art piece titled The Rivers Monument has been installed at the A-B Connector at Vancouver International Airport, since January 2015. The Rivers Monument consists of two 8.5 m-tall blue glass poles, similar to totem poles on the Northwest Coast, enclosed by a water feature and an oval wooden bench at the base. Displaying indigenous designs inside the glass, the two poles represent the Columbia River and the Fraser River, revealing their respective histories concerning how European colonizers’ construction of dams greatly reduced the salmon population and obliterated thousands of indigenous pictographs. Marianne Nicolson has expressed optimism about the YVR for selecting her \\"very political\\" artwork for the connector, \\"[pushing] their own boundaries slightly\\" and raising awareness about indigenous peoples and their histories. = AWI'NAGWISKASU: Real Land = April 21 - July 2, 2017, The exhibit was curated by Jesse Birch and Liz Park and featured the artists' scope via paintings, installations and video. The works therein represented concerns/fears about the surrounding waters of the community. = Tunics of the Changing Tide: = In her 2007 painting Tunics of the Changing Tide, exhibited at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2017, Nicolson has illustrated two garments bearing the figures of a Thunderbird, a mink, a snake, and a tree. Outlines of ravens, wolves, and people are painted in the background, and objects such as coppers and coins, representing wealth and status, are attached on the surface. As its title implies, Nicolson's painting draws attention to the experiences of the Kwikwasut’inuxw and Dzawada̱’enux̱w in terms of their economic growth and decline due to colonization, and makes reference to the swing from the flourishing economy of the 1880s to the downfall of the Northwest Coast nations in the 1920s due to potlatch ban legislation. A 1929 coin on the Thunderbird denotes the revival of cultural traditions amongst the Kwakwa̱ka̱’wakw, and their resistance against assimilation. = To refuse, to wait, to sleep = The exhibition To refuse, to wait, to sleep was held at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2017. Nicolson's piece \\"The Sun is Setting on the British Empire\\" was commissioned for the exhibition. She reworks the British Columbia provincial flag by repositioning and inverting the Union Jack below a setting/rising sun that has been recreated in the Kwakwaka’wakw style. Nicolson references the flag's original orientation (1895-1906); while the early version shows the sun atop the Union Jack and suggests a cooperative situation and mutually beneficial alliances between the crown and Indigenous nations, these emblems were reversed in 1906 and symbolically reveal a relationship of oppression, theft and genocide. By righting the symbols of the flag back to their original relationship, Nicolson's banner instills hope for and assertion of Indigenous rights over the land, which today remain largely unresolved. It was installed on the exterior of the Belkin and remains there as an outdoor art piece. = Waterline = Nicolson's work Waterline, exhibited in 2018 at the Birmingham Museum of Art, gives focus to sacred and life-sustaining waterways. The form of the sculpture is derived from traditional bentwood boxes. The images that are presented as the light moves up and down, mimicking the tidal flow of waters, show animals and symbols important to Nicolson's Kwakwaka’wakw heritage. The installation references ancient Kwakwaka’wakw cliff pictographs that are in danger of being lost because of industrial structures now control the rise and fall of river-water levels and indigenous sites, causing ancient Kwakwaka’wakw pictographs on cliffs and river rocks to disappear under rising water, and then reemerge. = Hexsa'am: To Be Here Always = Exhibited at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2019, Hexsa'am: To Be Here Always aims to foreground Dzawada'enuxw First Nation's lawsuit to extend Indigenous land title to waters in order to fight Marine Harvest Canada and Cermaq Canada fish farms in the Broughton Archipelago near Kingcome Inlet. The lawsuit and exhibition raises issues about Indigenous jurisdiction, land and water \\"in a way that journalism or political protest in the streets do not\\".

Susan Frowde was born in East Knoyle in Wiltshire in 1756, the daughter of James Frowde Esq., a local gentleman. She met Pellew in 1782 and they married on 28 May 1783 when she was aged eighteen and he twenty-six. The couple lived in Truro, Cornwall, for a short period after their marriage before moving to New Road in Flushing, close to Falmouth where Susan's brother-in-law Samuel Pellew was Collector of Customs. Susan and her husband had six children: * Emma Mary Pellew (18 January 1785 – March 1835) * Pownoll Bastard Pellew, later 2nd Viscount Exmouth (1 July 1786 – 2 December 1833) * Julia Pellew (28 November 1787 – 26 December 1831) * Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds Pellew, later an admiral and knight (13 December 1789 – 28 July 1861) * George Pellew, Dean of Norwich (3 April 1793 – 13 October 1866) * Edward William Pellew, later a minister (3 November 1799 – 29 August 1869) After Pellew was knighted for defeating the French frigate Cléopâtre in the Action of 18 June 1793, King George III awarded Susan a £150 annuity from the Privy Purse to cover additional household expenses associated with her husband's new title. Susan later became Lady Exmouth, when Pellew was made Baron Exmouth of Canonteign in 1814. In 1797, as her husband's fame increased following the Action of 13 January 1797, when Pellew's frigate HMS Indefatigable and her consort HMS Amazon defeated the French 74-gun ship Droits de l'Homme, Susan and the family moved from their terraced house in Flushing to the rented Trefusis Manor. Susan was a devoted wife who supported her husband's naval career, managed their estate and raised their family during his absences at sea; however, she vehemently opposed his political ambitions and when he was appointed MP for Barnstaple in 1802 she refused to accompany him to London. When Pellew was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station in 1805, Susan chose to remain in England with her family. Though the couple were apart for five years, they maintained a regular correspondence. While Pellew was serving in the East Indies, Susan took in a young woman in reduced circumstances, Jane Smith, who came to regard Susan and Pellew as her adopted parents. In 1804 Susan bought the family's first property, Hampton House in Plymouth. She lived there until 1811 when she sold the property to the Reverend Robert Hawker. In 1812 Susan purchased two new properties for the family: Canonteign House, where her eldest son Pownoll lived with his wife Eliza, and West Cliffe House (now Bitton House) in Teignmouth where she and her husband resided after his retirement, with various children and grandchildren, until his death in 1833. Susan disapproved of the posthumous biography of Pellew, commissioned by his brother Samuel and written by Edward Osler, and she burned the majority of her husband's personal correspondence.

Luetta Elmina (Bumstead) Braumuller (December 4, 1856 – December 13, 1898) was an artist and publisher who founded the periodical The China Decorator. Biography Luetta Elmina Bumstead was born in Monson, Massachusetts, in 1856, the fourth of six children of Colonel Arnold Bumstead and Elmina M. Bumstead. Developing an early interest in art, she made several trips to Europe to study art, in 1880 (Berlin), 1882 (Berlin, Paris, and Sèvres), 1889 (Dresden), and 1890 (Paris). She studied drawing and painting, especially painting on porcelain and glass painting. She married Otto L. Braumuller, a New York piano manufacturer; they had two children, Herman and Bertha. In the United States, she taught ceramic art and in 1882 published a handbook entitled Lessons in China Painting. Feeling that a periodical would find a wider readership, in 1887 she founded The China Decorator, a monthly magazine devoted to the art of china painting. A success from its first issue, it had a large circulation in both the United States and Europe. Braumuller developed a reputation of one of the country's experts in modern porcelain and pottery, and her magazine spurred a surge of interest in china painting in the United States. After her death at the age of 42 in 1898, the magazine continued for a year under the direction of her husband and son. It was then sold to the publisher George Thiell Long, whose wife, Adelaide Husted Long, became the magazine's editor.

He specialized in the study of colloids. Early life and education Bartell was born on June 16, 1883 in Concord, Michigan. He was an undergraduate at Albion College and graduated in 1905. After a short period as an instructor of chemistry at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, Bartell returned to Michigan and began graduate studies in chemistry at the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. in 1910. Academic career After finishing his Ph.D., Bartell remained at the University of Michigan as faculty, reaching full professorship in 1924. Bartell's research and teaching were focused on colloid chemistry and included the development of one of the first courses on the topic in United States universities, first offered in 1913. This course led to the publication of widely used and well-regarded laboratory manual in colloid chemistry. Among those undergraduate chemistry students recruited to assist with Bartell's courses was future biochemist Albert Baird Hastings. Bartell served on several university administrative committees, co-organized conferences on colloid chemistry, and co-organized the American Chemical Society's Colloid Division in 1926. The ACS recognized him for his career achievements with the award of its Kendall Award in Colloid Chemistry in 1959. Bartell's research work had military applications and he was involved in war efforts throughout his career, serving as a captain in the Army's Nitrate Division starting during World War I and as a consultant to what was then the War Department starting in the 1920s. During World War II he was recognized for materials science advances in developing a water- and heat-resistant fabric treatment called \\"aerobond\\", for which he received funding from the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1944 and which was proposed in 1946 for further development for peacetime applications. Bartell retired from his faculty position, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1953, though he continued to advise Ph.D. students after his official retirement. Personal life Bartell and his wife married in 1921 and had two children. Their daughter died young in 1946; their son Lawrence Bartell eventually became a noted professor of chemistry in his own right, serving on the faculty of Iowa State University and later as the Philip J. Elving Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Floyd Bartell died on March 5, 1961.

He was suffect consul during the nundinium of September to October AD 83 with Lucius Calventius Sextius Carminius Vetus.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), p. 160 Although some experts consider him a rival with Trajan as heir apparent to the emperor Nerva, he is primarily known from inscriptions. His polyonymous name has led to many interpretations. One, based on the form of his name used in consular dating (\\"M. Cornelius Nigrinus\\"), is that he was born Cornelius and adopted by a Curiatius Maternus (likely the orator of Tacitus' Dialogus de oratoribus), but Olli Salomies notes \\"the order of the names makes this altogether unlikely\\".Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 132 Ronald Syme suggested that \\"not perhaps a Cornelius adopting a Curiatius (still less the reverse, as some incautiously assumed), but rather the son of a Curatia. That is, a presumed sister of (C.?) Curiatius Maternus, orator, dramatist, and the central character in the Dialogus of Tacitus.\\"Syme, \\"The Paternity of Polyonymous Consuls\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 61 (1985), p. 193 Some authorities have suggested that this Curiatius is the same person as the orator in Tacitus' short work.T. D. Barnes, \\"Curiatius Maternus\\", Hermes, 109 (1981), pp. 382-384  Life  Maternus was born to the equestrian order; his hometown was Liria in Hispania, where an inscription honoring him was found. While still an eques, Maternus served as a military tribune of Legio XIV Gemina, which was stationed in Roman Britain at the time. He was adlected into the Roman Senate as an ex-praetor by Vespasian for his loyalty in the Year of Four Emperors.George W. Houston, \\"Vespasian's Adlection of Men in Senatum\\", American Journal of Philology, 98 (1977), p. 39 He served as governor of Gallia Aquitania from AD 80 until at least as late as 83; we have no record of another governor for this province until 94, when Senecio Memmius Afer is known to have held the position.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 304-306 He was later governor of Moesia from 85 until its division into Moesia Inferior and Moesia Superior; subsequently he was governor of Moesia Inferior until 89.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 310-315 He apparently was involved in Domitian's Dacian War, for during his governorship Maternus received a number of dona militaria, or military decorations, including two mural crowns and two camp crowns. A few years passed until Maternus was appointed to govern Syria in 95, which he held into the reign of Nerva.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 324-328  Maternus and Nerva  In a letter Pliny the Younger wrote to his friend Quadratus, while recounting an anecdote set during the short reign of the emperor Nerva, Pliny alludes to a man in charge of a massive army in the eastern part of the empire, about whom there was a lot of gossip, some causing apprehension.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.13.11 It is commonly presumed that this person was the governor of Syria; further, due to the date, this person is commonly assumed to be a rival to Trajan for the position of successor to Nerva.Andrew Berriman, Malcolm Todd and Malcom Todd, \\"A Very Roman Coup: The Hidden War of Imperial Succession, AD 96-8\\", Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte, 50 (2001), pp. 317-323 It was thought that this unnamed person was Gaius Octavius Tidius Tossianus Lucius Javolenus Priscus, known to be governor of Syria in the 90s. However, Berriman, et al., believe it unlikely that Javolenus Priscus, \\"known as a jurist and member of Trajan's consilium rather than a military man, could have contemplated a challenge for the throne, much less that he would have remained in favour with Trajan thereafter\\".Berriman, et alia, \\"Very Roman Coup\\", p. 319 More recently Géza Alföldy and Helmut Halfmann have presented Maternus as the individual Pliny likely alluded to in his letter to Quadratus.Alföldy and Halfmann, \\"M. Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, General Domitians und Rivale\\", Chiron, 3 (1973), pp. 331–373 An anomaly in the career of Aulus Larcius Priscus, suffect consul in 110, supports Maternus' identification. At the time, Priscus, who had been quaestor of Asia, then military tribune of Legio IV Scythica based in Syria, was appointed to the governorship of Syria. Syria was an important province, and its administration was usually assigned to a senior senator who had previously held the consulate. An appointment like this would only be made in an emergency, when something had happened to the previous governor. Any rival to Trajan, upon the latter's ascension to the throne, at the least would have been removed from an imperial position, and at most would have been executed. Whatever his fate, we have no record of Maternus after AD 97.

She served as the art editor of Demorest's Magazine. Secret Society Buildings New Haven,\\" from a drawing by Alice Donlevy (ca. 1880) Early years and education Born in Manchester, England, 7 January 1846, Donlevy came to the United States in her infancy, after the death of her mother. In 1854, her father, the inventor-engraver, John Intaglio Donlevy, married Harriet Farley. In 1856, Horace Greeley took Donlevy to the New York School of Design, a free art school for Women founded in 1852. Greeley convinced the school's director, Henry Herrick, to allow the 10-year-old girl to begin studying the arts of engraving. When the School was moved to the Cooper Union in 1858, Donlevy went with it. For seven years, she devoted her attention to designing wood-engravings for books and magazines, being one of the first workers in this art to introduce that original feature of American wood-engraving, the use of dots instead of lines for shades and shadows. Later, engraving was given up for designing for decoration. Since childhood, she drew with pen and ink for reproduction, her father, John Intaglio Donlevy, having invented certain valuable reproductive processes. She exhibited, while still very young, in the Academy of Design, and won prizes for general attainments. She received a second prize awarded by the Philadelphia Sketch Club for illumination. At the age of 14, she wrote for the press. Career In 1867, Donlevy published \\"Practical Hints on the Art of Illumination.\\" The manual, illustrated with Donlevy's original art work, encouraged artists working for industry as copyists to learn the arts of design. Thereafter, she wrote for the Art Review of Boston, the Art Amateur, the Art Interchange, St. Nicholas, Harper's Young People, The Ladies' World, Demorest's Magazine, and the Chautauquan. She served as the art editor of Demorest's Magazine. In 1867, she was one of the nine professional women artists who founded the Ladies' Art Association of New York. Among new professions for women established by the association was that of porcelain painting. In 1887, Donlevy was one of the committee of three to go to Albany, New York and lay before the New York State Legislature plans of free art industrial instruction for talented boys, girls and women, to be given during vacation seasons and on Saturday afternoons. The bill passed both houses. It was defeated later by eight votes when called up for reconsideration by Robert Ray Hamilton. Probably the best work of Donlevy was the aid that she personally gave to promote the interests of struggling associations and individual artists by means of free lectures and free lessons, and also by giving the latter introduction by means of public receptions at which their works were exhibited. Donlevy died in 1929. Her papers are held by the New York Public Library.

Her ideas reflected the principles of the feminist movement in the 60´s. Women´s development through education is the main topic of many of her pedagogical reflections. As an active socialist, she was a member of the PSE (Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano) as she believed it to be the national revindication movement, that represented principles to fulfill Ecuadorian needs. She and her husband invested their intellectual effort, as well as their own economic resources, to change the methodology that teachers used in Ecuadorian schools. Her work is considered a milestone in the struggle to reach quality education for women.  Life  Elisa Ortiz was born on September 12, 1902 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Her parents were Ángel Jorge Ortiz Montufar and Victoria Guadalupe Garcés Salazar. She grew up in a changing time when Eloy Alfaro had begun a period of liberalism in Ecuador. When Elisa was eight, her family had to move to Ambato due to her mother’s illness. There, she studied in a private school where she was severely punished. Because of this traumatic event, she refused to attend an educational institution. She and her siblings were home-schooled. At the age of sixteen, she went back to Guayaquil to finish her education. She studied at “Normal Rita Lecumberri”, being one of the most brilliant students. She got a scholarship at “Normal Manuela Cañizares” High School. On July 25, 1921 she graduated and began to work as a Spanish teacher in the same High School at the age of nineteen. In 1924, she met Alfonso Aulestia Bravo, a coworker, and they got married. Sponsored by the German Mission, he got a scholarship to study in the “Tecnische Universität Berlin” in Berlin. Back from Germany, they both implemented new methodologies to improve technical education and try to contribute to the country’s development. She dedicated her life to her convictions of empowering women through education. On November 27, 1991, she died peacefully among her children at the age of 89.  Professional  = Educational field = * 1921: She joined the “Normal Manuela Cañizares” workforce.

She appended other institutions to the High School, she also appended two institutions created by herself, which would update teachers’ level of knowledge. * 1938: She planned a pedagogical and methodological reform to which many opposed. She traveled to Peru to understand its educational system, because of which she was accused of economically impairing the State treasury; she permitted the registration of two pregnant girls for their senior year and she accepted the registration of an Afro-Ecuadorian student. * 1941: Elisa was invited by the Ann Arbor University of the State of Michigan, USA, to teach Spanish and to observe the institutional structure, the academic fundamentals and the organization of that University’s educational system. When she returned to Ecuador, she had been removed from her position and told that her educational services were no longer required. * 1946 to 1963: due to the rejection experienced in her own country, she exiled herself to Chile, country that welcomed her, valued her professional competence and she was hired her as a Teacher in the Pedagogical Section of the Ministry of Education. * 1963: she was called by the Ministry of Education of Ecuador to work as a technical advisor for the Holistic Education Planning Department. * 1964 to 1971: She was a technical advisor for the Holistic Education Planning Department Planning until 1971 when she retired. =Political field= * 1922: She joined the “Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano” * 1924: She presided the “Centro Feminista Luz de Pichincha”.

Biography  Friedman, née Shenberg, was born in Los Angeles to Nathaniel and Hortense Schenberg. After majoring in design at University of California, Los Angeles, she taught design at Los Angeles City College before moving with her husband to Minneapolis in 1958. She was hired by the Walker Art Center as a design consultant in 1969. Friedman was promoted to Curator of Design in 1979, after having conceived and organized several seminal exhibitions, such as the 1975 exhibition, Nelson/Eames/Girard/Propst: The Design Process at Herman Miller (Design Quarterly 98/99),http://www.worldcat.org/title/nelson-eames-girard-propst-the-design- process-at-herman-miller/oclc/6202594&referer;=brief_results bringing about further scrutiny and critical accolades for design as an art. She continued to work at Walker Art Center in many capacities up until her retirement in 1990. In addition to curating exhibits on architecture and design, including the Walker's noted 1986 exhibition Frank Gehry, architect, Friedman was also instrumental in shaping the remodeling and interiors of the Walker. Friedman was also interested in making architecture and design more accessible. \\"What interests me about movements in architecture and design is when something really has an impact on the way people live and the way they think.\\" In addition to her role as Curator of Design, Friedman also wrote extensively and served as an editor for several exhibition publications. Her first job at the Walker Art Center in 1969 was as the editor of Design Quarterly, a publication started by the Walker (1954-1996; previous title: Everyday Art Quarterly, 1946-1953). The last issue she edited was no. 152 (1991). In 2013, the Walker Art Center named their design fellowship, the Mildred S. Friedman Design Fellowship, a program started under Friedman's leadership in the 1980, in Friedman's honor.  Major exhibitions  Friedman curated or co-curated many large shows, from the 1970s up until the mid-2000s. In addition to Frank Gehry, architect, other notable shows include De Stijl, 1917-1931: Visions of Utopia and Tokyo: Form and Spirit. The last show she curated, Architecture Tomorrow, was a three year long series that ran from 1988-1991, ending after she retired.

She was built in 2018 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France, the fourth in Royal Caribbean's Oasis class of cruise ships. At , she is the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassing her sister ship , also owned by Royal Caribbean International. Description and design Symphony of the Seas measures in length and has a gross tonnage of 228,081 across 18 decks. She is able to accommodate 5,518 passengers at double occupancy up to a maximum capacity of 6,680 passengers, as well as a 2,200-person crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 22 restaurants, 4 pools and 2,759 cabins. For size perspective, Symphony of the Seas is about 30 metres (98 feet) longer than the largest military ships ever built, the U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. When compared to landmarks, Symphony of the Seas is as long as 3.5 football fields and twice as long as the height of the Washington Monument. Facilities include a children's water park, a full-size basketball court, ice-skating rink, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a Broadway-style theater with seating capacity of 1,401 passengers, an outdoor aquatic theater with Olympic-height platforms, and two rock-climbing walls. There is also a park containing over 20,000 tropical plants. The plants are maintained by an onboard team of one landscape specialist and three horticulturalists. One of the cocktail bars onboard includes electronic ordering via tablet and drink preparation by two robot bartenders that can prepare up to two drinks per minute. A significant part of the ship design was focused on the infrastructure, including safety, air conditioning, electric systems, water systems, and power generation. The ship includes a number of independent fire zones which can be cut off in the event of an emergency. Symphony of the Seas is powered onboard by six marine-diesel sets each composed of three 16-cylinder Wärtsilä 16V46D common rail engines and three 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 12V46D engines. The ship power system has a fuel consumption rate between 1,033 and 1,377 gallons of fuel per engine per hour. The energy efficient design of Symphony of the Seas enables it to accomplish shipboard power generation with 85 MW versus the 100 MW normally found on Oasis class ships. One of the key design features is the use of only LED or fluorescent lights in order to avoid the heat generation from incandescent bulbs, thereby reducing the load on air conditioning systems. The air conditioning systems are localized in order to minimize the inefficiencies of blowing cold air around the ship from a central location. Additional energy efficiency is accomplished by using a 2 MW steam turbine to recover waste heat from the engines and converting it into energy to power a portion of the onboard hotel load, such as laundry and other electrical loads. The ship's size and electrical load made it favorable to install the waste heat recovery system, which reduces the need for oil-fired boilers. For propulsion, Symphony of the Seas uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7380 horsepower. Among the Oasis class ships, Symphony of the Seas uses 25% less fuel due to the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water. The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship. Symphony of the Seas is designed to be a zero-landfill ship with all waste recycled, processed through water-purification systems, incinerated, or sent to a waste-to-energy facility. Construction and career On 29 October 2015 the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint- Nazaire, France. Symphony of the Seas floated out on 9 June 2017. Actors Alexa Vega, Carlos Pena Jr. and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \\"Godfamily\\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor. The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018. Night view of Symphony of the Seas at Saint-Nazaire From 15 to 18 February 2018 the cruise ship underwent sea trials and was formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March. On 24 March the ship left Saint-Nazaire for Málaga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March, and arrived at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March. Symphony of the Seas in Naples, Italy On 31 March 2018 Symphony of the Seas offered her first passenger cruise and began her maiden voyage on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean. During her first season Symphony of the Seas continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the Caribbean. In January 2019, while Symphony of the Seas was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a passenger jumped overboard and survived. The passenger and his friends were turned over to Nassau law enforcement. They were not charged, but were required to return home at their own expense. In August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials. During the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean has suspended all service across most of its fleet, including Symphony of the Seas, until 31 October 2020. A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020. The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.

Alfredson's paintings do not fall into a single category but instead cross over and combine Surrealism and Magic Realism as well as Symbolist and Fantastic art; a strong emphasis on classical painting technique is a major feature of the artist's work. Alfredson is a \\"Pansurrealist\\" according to Terrance Lindall in his essay What's New in the Surreal World? Lindall makes the point that contemporary artists whose works evolve out of the subconscious and the dream state form a type of new surrealism. According to Lindall, this new form of surrealism is more diversified when compared to the original Surrealist movement, but Pansurrealist artists such as Alfredson continue to depend on the subconscious as the foundation for artworks that are surreal and visionary. Early life and education Alfredson was born in Örebro, Sweden, to a Finnish mother and a Swedish father. Early in life, Alfredson's parents recognized their young son's talent and, after Alfredson announced at age seven that he would become an artist, his father taught the young boy the basics of oil painting.Andersson, Yngve, (29 March 2003),\\"A Magical Realist\\" translated from Blekinge LänsTidning Magazine. In his early teens, Alfredson was submitting caricatures and cartoons to Swedish newspapers and magazines; the Swedish edition of Mad Magazine was one of the first to publish Alfredson's images. Sixteen-year-old Alfredson first exhibited his work professionally in a group show in Sölvesborg at Nicolaigården. The same year, he left home to attend Fetco's School of Fine Arts (now Konstskolan i Stockholm) and later took advanced classes in formal painting at Pernby's Målarskola in Stockholm. Early career In 1980, Alfredson sold his first painting UFO Sverige Aktuellt to a Swedish magazine; it subsequently was shown at an exhibition of UFO artwork in the Köpings Museum; the commissioned work depicted a UFO in the sky with two aliens standing below. During the 1980s, Alfredson lived, worked, and exhibited in Stockholm, participating in several art shows including Stockholm's Fria Konstmassa (Stockholm's Free Art Fair), juried by radio producer Peter R. Meyer. His work was also exhibited at Svarta Månen (Black Moon), a bookstore and arts center that featured concerts and poetry readings that were broadcast from an in-house radio station. From 1985 to 1987, Alfredson organized and catalogued artworks for Liljevalchs Konsthall, one of Stockholm's contemporary art museums. = Arrival in New York = Alfredson arrived in New York City in 1995 with a solo exhibition at the Limner Gallery in SoHo. Within a few months, the artist had earned the title \\"The darling of the New York underground scene\\" with artwork in twenty shows during the first year after his arrival. Alfredson's art career was given a boost in 1998 when Thelma Golden of the Whitney Museum curated one of his pieces into the juried show \\"Art as Spectacle\\" at the Katonah Museum. The exhibition, labeled the year's \\"most prestigious\\" by the New York Times, was considered a tri-state event. During the same year, while exhibiting in a gallery in Brooklyn, Alfredson met photographer Mia Hanson who later became his wife. In 1998, the couple lived and worked first in California, then in Stockholm, and in 2001 returned to Manhattan to take up residence in the Hotel Chelsea. = Living and painting in the Hotel Chelsea = For the next decade, Alfredson and his wife lived in New York's Chelsea Hotel where Alfredson produced and displayed as many as fifty pieces at a time in the hotel's stairwell and hallways. While being interviewed by Abel Ferrara in the documentary \\"Chelsea on the Rocks,\\" Alfredson told of a hotel resident who had a psychotic break and slashed several of Hawk's paintings. Alfredson said he had no animosity toward the man, stating the documentary's memorable words, \\"We all have our scars . . .he gave my paintings a couple of scars.\\" Hawk and his wife appeared on part of the \\"Hotel Secrets\\" series that marked the restructuring of the Hotel Chelsea and removal of the artistic element. The couple left in 2010 along with other long-time residents. Artwork Since Alfredson's work often depicts images taken from \\"the strange visionary periods between sleeping and waking,\\" the artist is associated with the Pansurrealism movement. His use of many motifs imbued with mystical symbolism also places his work into several categories such as Magic Realism and Symbolist Art. Alfredson works almost exclusively with oil paints, using detailed brushwork, multiple layers of glazing, and a northern European palette—classically rendering images with an emphasis on craftsmanship and composition. Dream-like environments and people form the basis of his representational work, with symbols and detailed patterns—\\"circlings\\" and complex Fibonacci spiral motifs—dominant in the non- objective paintings. Although Alfredson's artwork displays a variety of motifs and themes, many of the images can be loosely grouped into five major categories: frontal portraits such as those found in the Dream Ambassador series; solitary standing or floating figures often surrounded by mystical objects and symbols; large \\"swarm paintings\\" which show nightmarish, chaotic scenes; inorganic and organic objects with otherworldly, numinous qualities; and abstract paintings depicting spirals, circlings, and complex patterns. Representative samples of the five categories include: *Icon for an Unknown Religion (frontal portraits) *Stebuklingas Drugelis (the upright figure series) *Tight Antic II (the chaos series) *Nostradamus' Last Words I (the mystical objects series) *Blue World Circlings aka Blue World, (symbolic nonobjective category) During an interview in a New York gallery Hawk stated, \\"I want to transport the viewer into an altered state of consciousness. . . perceiving the images filtered through their own reality.\\"  Influences  When in art school in Stockholm, Hawk Alfredson was greatly influenced by the artwork of surrealists Salvador Dalí and René Magritte; Alfredson considers some of Dali's work remains \\"fascinating on many levels\\" but has not remained a major influence. Old Masters who influenced Alfredson's early artistic development include Johannes Vermeer, Jan van Eyck, and Georges de La Tour. Alfredson's artwork also shows the influence of Swiss Symbolist painter Arnold Böcklin. Of contemporary artists, Alfredson identifies Odd Nerdrum as having had a deep and lasting impact: \\"I think he's one of the best living artists on this planet.\\" Alfredson readily acknowledges the early influence of historical figures such as Visionary artists Hieronymus Bosch and William Blake or Symbolist artists Karel Vítězslav Mašek and Edvard Munch. When in his early 20s, Alfredson came upon a painting by Alberto Giacometti and \\"it truly mesmerized me and put me in a dreamlike, hypnotic state of mind where time and space disappeared. The films of Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Alain Resnais, and Carl Theodor Dreyer also helped strengthen the emerging artist's vision. Written works such as Gustav Meyrink's The Golem as well as hallucinatory stories of Carolos Castaneda, Zoran Zivkovic, and Hector Gramme have influenced Alfredson's artistic vision.

J. \\"Skid\\" Simon (190448), first published in 1945. It contains practical advice directed mainly towards rubber bridge players, and introduces to the world four stereotypical bad players: Mr Smug, the Unlucky Expert, Mrs Guggenheim, and Futile Willie. It has been much admired by duplicate bridge players as well as by rubber bridge players, and Simon's fictional characters have passed into legend. Cut for Partners, another book by Simon, recounts the further misadventures of his four fictional players. It was published posthumously in 1950.  Why You Lose at Bridge  = Introduction = Simon dedicated the book to the memory of Richard Lederer, his friend and fellow bridge expert. \\"Portrait\\" (Simon's title for his preface to his book) exemplifies his style of writing: According to Simon, the two primary reasons for losing at bridge are (a) lack of technical skill and (b) losing tactics. Simon claims to address the latter alone, but that is not entirely true: for example, Chapters II and III include sound technical advice on cardplay. = Summary of contents = The book consists of 12 chapters: I \\"The Points You Lose 'Ignoring the Odds'\\", II \\"The Points You Lose Playing the Dummy\\", III \\"The Points You Lose in Defence\\", IV \\"The Points You Lose 'Bidding'\\", V \\"The Points You Lose NOT Doubling\\", VI \\"Your Battlefield\\", VII \\"Don't Teach Your Partner\\", VIII \\"Half a Loaf\\", IX \\"They Can't Fool Me!\\", X \\"Fixed - By Palookas!\\", XI \\"The Logic of Luck\\", and XII \\"A Rubber at the Club\\". Chapters I-IV relate mainly to technical aspects of bidding and play. They include some of Simon's better-known aphorisms Chapter V discusses the penalty double; whose theory is, according to Simon, the least understood theory in Contract Bridge. In Chapters VI-VIII, Simon turns to the practicalities of cut-in rubber bridge played for money. The title of Chapter VIII alludes to the English proverb \\"Half a loaf is better than no bread\\". The professional rubber bridge player aims for: Chapters IX and X relate to how to counter preemptive and psychic bidding; and to when and to when not to use such tactics yourself. Chapter XI is concerned with the effect which good and bad runs of cards might have on a professional money bridge player's confidence and skill. In Chapter XII, Simon brings together, and completes, his quartet of fictional bridge players for: = A Rubber at the Club = In this, the concluding part of Why You Lose at Bridge, Simon describes and analyses a rubber played by his four fictional players: Mr Smug, the Unlucky Expert, Mrs Guggenheim, and Futile Willie. The rubber consists of nine deals, all from actual play. Each deal is shown in full; followed by the auction, with Simon's comments; a narrative description of the play; the players' post mortem, with interjections by Simon; and his calculation of the number of total points chucked away. Every hand exhibits various kinds and degrees of ineptitude; except that in the final one, the Unlucky Expert skilfully executes a dummy reversal and squeeze once played at the table by Jack Marx. The result is a washout: a trivial difference in score, with no winners and no losers. Simon then rapidly demonstrates how an \\"ordinary, sound, common-sense player\\" would have won a 9-, 12-, 14- or 20-point rubber.In England, rubber bridge is played for a fixed stake per hundred points difference between the total point scores of the two sides, rounding scores of 1040 down and of 5090 up to the nearest hundred. Each such hundred is a \\"point\\" for scoring purposes; for example, a score difference of 850940 total points would be a nine point, or nine hundred point,  Cut for Partners  Simon's book Cut for Partners is in effect a continuation of the chapter \\"A Rubber at the Club\\" in his book Why You Lose at Bridge. It has an Introduction by Terence Reese. The same four fictional characters play three more rubbers (34 deals). No-one ever wants to cut in at their table. Their bidding and play are both believable and ineffective; except that the Unlucky Expert does exhibit his card-playing skill, including one brilliancy. Two deals later, Futile Willie attempts the same brilliancy, on the wrong hand; and it backfires, badly. As before, each deal and auction is shown in full, with Simon's comments; followed by a narrative description of the play and its aftermath; and finally a brief analysis of the result.  Critical reception and legacy  Why You Lose at Bridge has rarely been out of print. Although it is primarily concerned with rubber bridge, it has been much admired by duplicate bridge players for its relevance to that form of the game also. * 1967The Bridge Players' Encyclopedia: a \\"classic\\", a book which made \\"a major contribution to the technical development of the game\\", and an \\"optional requirement for a modern technical bridge library\\". * 1977Terence Reese: \\"S.

Influenced by family members and Southern black gospel traditions, the ensemble recorded 18 singles during the peak of their popularity in the 1940s under the leadership of singer-songwriter Lander Coleman. In their heyday, the Coleman Brothers were a pioneering presence on music radio and received extended notice when their song \\"Milky White Way\\" was covered by the Trumpeteers to huge commercial success.  History  The nucleus of the Coleman Brothers came together, at least in rudimentary form, in 1932. All musicians in the group had a background rooted in spiritual and jubilee traditions, with each one singing, some independently of one another, in churches and concert programs. In addition, an earlier ensemble consisting of an older generation of Coleman family members performed throughout New Jersey under the same name between 1917 and 1925 but never recorded. The line- up was in a constant state of instability in the early years of its existence until brothers Lander (lead vocals), Russell (tenor), Wallace (baritone), Melvin (bass) and Everitte Coleman (guitar), as well as Danny Owens (second tenor), came together in 1935. Between 1935 and 1942, the Coleman Brothers were popular figures in package tours across the American south and west, appearing recurrently with the Soul Stirrers and the Dixie Hummingbirds. The group also spent time singing on radio programs WHBI, WPAT, and WABC before receiving a vocal staff contract with CBS in New York in 1943. There, the group sponsored major companies, becoming one of the first black ensembles to do so when they promoted the Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company on national television. As the Coleman Brothers broadcast an early morning programme for CBS, their manager Milt Lasnick arranged a one-off single deal with Decca Records. The record coupled cover versions of \\"Low Down Chariot\\" and \\"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\\". More recordings were released by Manor Records, including Coleman's \\"Milky White Way\\", a song that became an enormous hit for the Trumpeteers in 1948. The brothers became so popular that they established a business enterprise which included a record label (Coleman Records), a lodge, a hotel in Newark, and a collection of barbecue restaurants. Their label released six singles by the Coleman Brothers, among other acts, and had a national hit with the Ray-O-Vacs whose take on the song \\"I'll Always Be in Love with You\\" reached number eight on the Billboard R&B; Charts. To direct the rapidly expanding venture, Melvin Coleman left the group to become the business's full-time president, and was replaced by A.J. Eldridge. By 1946, the group moved to Cincinnati to work for WLW, the same station that launched the Mills Brothers' career. In 1951, the Coleman Brothers disbanded after recording three singles for Regal Records a year earlier. For a while, Lander Coleman managed a club in Newark before forming a new Coleman Brothers group in 1964 and recording a studio album, titled Milky White Way to capitalize on the rendition done by Elvis Presley. Coleman continued to perform with the quartet until two of its members were wounded in a robbery in 1978. The Coleman label, supervised by Melvin Coleman, was sold to Savoy Records after his death in 1959.

At sea it was employed as a light anti-aircraft gun, while on land it was mounted on armored command vehicles where it was used as a heavy machine gun. After World War II it remained in use aboard the patrol boats of the Guardia di Finanza. History The Breda Model 31 was a license built copy of the French Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun. Breda acquired a production license in 1929, but it did not enter production until 1931. The Model 31 was often mounted on single and twin mounts aboard surface ships and on a disappearing twin mount aboard submarines. The Model 31 was intended to provide close-range air defense, but like its counterparts in other nations, these small-caliber guns were found incapable of defending against low-level torpedo-bombers or high altitude level-bomber attacks because their bullets were too light and short ranged. Although a reliable gun with good performance, it was later replaced by the Breda 20/65 Mod. 1935. Construction The Model 31 was a gas-operated, air-cooled machine gun with a tilting bolt action. It was fed by top mounted, semi-circular, thirty round magazines, with cooling air drawn through the sleeve to fins along the barrel.

She is known for work that depicts South Asian women openly displaying body hair. Biography Khan is a first-generation Pakistani-American who was born and raised in New York City. She identifies as Muslim. Raised in a predominantly white area, Khan felt pressure to fit in with her peers and described herself in a 2018 interview with Allure as \\"somebody who had to prepare two hours to wake up early to make sure I had no hair on my face.\\" She continued removing unwanted hair until college. Between 2016 and 2017 she stopped removing any body hair at all and struggled with the reactions of the general public and her family. After beginning to reject societal expectations about body hair for herself, she began painting artwork featuring women with facial and body hair. As of 2020, Khan is a student at Cooper Union, and was selected to participate in a study abroad program at Central Saint Martins. Career Khan's work features traditional South Asian motifs and symbols of American youth culture and focuses on brown women with visible body hair they have decided not to remove. The women are often seen in casual, personal or social settings because, as she explained in a 2016 interview, \\"body hair is a natural thing and so it makes sense for me to want to project it into my drawings of people.\\" Lia McGarrigle argued that the appeal of Khan's work is tied to how it challenges the inherent shame of traditional beauty standards toward body hair. Khan uses Tumblr and Instagram to connect and engage with her audience. In a 2016 profile, WNYC's Studio 360 explained her online presence has been well received by young women who identify with the imagery she creates and who have, in turn, confided their own stories of navigating two cultural experiences. Creators echoed that sentiment explaining that she has created spaces for people to discuss and share their own relationships and experiences with body hair. In 2017 Khan contributed art for one of a series of Mother's Day greeting cards created by the California nonprofit Forward Together that aimed to promote awareness about different types of motherhood.

Dyson has been publicly bullish on the technology, and has stated that it is “committed to investing £1bn in battery technology over the coming years, and Sakti3 is an essential and exciting part of that program.”  History  Sakti3 is a battery company co-founded by Dr. Ann Marie Sastry, Dr. Chia-Wei Wang and Dr. Fabio Albano, regarded as globally influential battery technology innovators, in 2007 as a spin-out from University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Publications by Sastry and her collaborators have been cited over 6,400 times. She and her two former students Dr. Chi-Wei Wand and Dr. Fabio Albano formed the company, hence the number \\"3\\" in the name; most have remained at the firm, according to a recently granted patent.United States Patent 9,627,709 Work by this group, including Dr. Chia-Wei Wang, Dr. Fabio Albano, Dr. Yen-Hung Chen, Dr. Xiangchun Zhang, Dr. Myoungdo Chung, and Dr. HyonCheol Kim, has been cited extensively (collectively over 4100 times). As reported in Scientific American, Sakti3 claimed to achieve 1143 Wh/L in volumetric energy density in its prototype solid-state lithium battery cells in 2014. In 2015, Sakti3 was invited to the first ever White House Demo Day by President Barack Obama to showcase its innovations. In 2015, Sakti3 was acquired by Dyson Ltd. They initially paid $15m for an undisclosed stake, this being Dyson's first outside investment. Later in the year, Dyson paid another $90m for the rest of Sakti3. Other investors had included Beringea, General Motors, Khosla Ventures and Itochu.  Technology  Sakti3 has described methods for producing scalable solid-state batteries, using thin film deposition guided by numerical simulations and optimization and apparently used multiple deposition techniques.United States Patents 9,127,344 and 9,240,584 Sakti3 has been recognized with several technical awards, including MIT Technology Review's Top 50 Most Disruptive Companies in 2012, and MIT Technology Review's 50 Smartest Companies in 2015. In 2014, Sakti3 is named by Crain’s Detroit Business as one of its Most Innovative Companies for its patents on “methods for manufacturing batteries, a solid-state propulsion system and automotive hybrid technology.” Sakti3 has grown its intellectual property portfolio to 94 patents and patents pending. In 2017, it abandoned its licenses of its early University of Michigan patents.  Workplace Culture  Sakti3 has been recognized multiple times for excellence in workplace culture. Sakti3 has won the AWE Workplace Excellence Seal of Approval Award for its for “exemplary commitment to building excellent places to work” in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Sakti3 has been named 101 Best and Brightest Companies to Work For in 2015 and 2016 for its “commitment to excellence in their human resource practices and employee enrichment.” Sakti3 was also awarded Crain’s Detroit Cool Places to Work in Michigan in 2016.  Criticism  Sakti3 has been criticized for its secretive nature, a trait it apparently shares with its acquirer. Dyson takes great measures to protect its technology and is “as secretive” as Apple. During a tour of Dyson’s facilities, a New York Times reporter observed that “employees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects;” “prototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits;” and “machinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags.” Claims made by the company over technological advances as well as its secretive behavior regarding sharing data have been criticized by former employees and media following the acquisition by Dyson. The only independently verified data on Sakti3's prototypes by the United States Department of Energy show a capacity of 2.4 mAh, only capable of powering very small devices. Steve Buckingham, a former employee, has publicly expressed his disappointment with the small area (1 cm²) of the best cell produced. Bob Kruse, formerly GM's most senior electric vehicle executive, stayed on as COO for less than 2 years. In November 2017 Ann Marie Sastry, Sakti3's founder, unexpected and quiet exit from the company stoked speculation that the company oversold their early successes.  Speculation  In an interview by Car and Driver in 2015, when asked the readiness of Sakti3’s batteries for automotive applications, Dr. Ann Marie Sastry responded that Sakti3 would first go to markets where their batteries can meet regulatory standards for the products and pointed out that durability standards for batteries in automotive applications are very different from phones or vacuums. The company has been praised for staying afloat and ultimately being acquired in a well-documented acquisition, amidst an intense period of bankruptcies in cleantech. It has been pointed out that it takes a decade to invent a new hardware technology, and more than another decade for the invention to reach the hands of consumers. It took James Dyson 15 years and 5,127 attempts to perfect his flagship vacuum.

Jumbo Comics was Fiction House's first comics title; the publisher had previously specialized in pulp magazines. The lead feature for Jumbo Comics' entire run was Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Notable creators who worked on Jumbo Comics include Jack Kirby (working under a variety of pseudonyms), Bob Kane, Matt Baker, Mort Meskin, Lou Fine, Bob Powell, Mort Leav, Art Saaf, Dick Briefer, Lily Renée, and Ruth Roche. Jerry Iger was Jumbo Comics' art director for its entire run.  Publication history  By the late 1930s, Fiction House publisher Thurman T. Scott expanded the company from pulp magazines to comic books, an emerging medium that began to seem a viable adjunct to the fading pulps. Receptive to a sales call by Eisner & Iger, one of the prominent \\"packagers\\" of that time that produced complete comic books on demand for publishers looking to enter the field, Scott published Jumbo Comics #1 (Sept. 1938) under Fiction House's Real Adventures Publishing Company imprint.Real Adventures Publishing Co., Inc., Grand Comics Database. Accessed Mar. 10, 2017. Sheena, Queen of the Jungle appeared in that initial issue. The character had debuted in 1937 in the British magazine Wags.Sheena, Queen of the Jungle at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original November 10, 2011 Indeed, all the material Eisner & Iger prepared for Jumbo Comics #1 (and the subsequent seven issues) had originally appeared in Wags, which was a tabloid-sized publication. For this reason, Jumbo Comics #1-8 were oversize (10-1/2\\" x 14-1/2\\") and exclusively in black and white. (The name \\"Jumbo\\" was derived from the oversized publication size.)Sergi, Joe. \\"Tales From the Code: The Near Extinction of Sheena,\\" CBLDF website (January 25, 2013). With issue #9, the title reverted to standard Golden Age comic size (8-1/2\\" x 10-1/2\\") and was printed in color.Quattro, Ken. \\"Return to Wonderful Wags of Oz,\\" The Comics Detective (Apr. 25, 2010). Bob Powell's first published comic-book art is tentatively identified as the uncredited three- page story \\"A Letter of Introduction,\\" featuring the famed ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, in Jumbo Comics #2 (Oct. 1938). Lou Fine's first published comics art was the strip \\"Wilton of the West\\" in Jumbo Comics #4 (Dec. 1938), signed with the house pen name \\"Fred Sande\\" (which strip originator Jack Kirby had used in previous issues). Ultimately, Fiction House published 167 issues of Jumbo Comics from September 1938–March 1953.  Recurring features  Three features in Jumbo Comics #1 representing Jack Kirby's first comic-book work following his debut in Wild Boy Magazine:Per Kirby's recollection in interview, The Nostalgia Journal #30 (Nov. 1976), reprinted in The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby (2002) , p. 3 * \\"The Diary of Dr. Hayward\\" — science fiction strip under the pseudonym \\"Curt Davis\\"; the strip was later continued by other artists until issue #9 * \\"Wilton of the West\\" — modern-West crimefighter strip as \\"Fred Sande\\"; the strip was later continued by other artists until c. issue #24 * Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo — serialized adaptation as \\"Jack Curtiss\\" In addition, Dick Briefer produced a serialized adaptation (in five-page installments) of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame which ran in the first 8 issues. Other recurring features: Sheena, Queen of the Jungle — soon became the company's star character, and her adventures appeared in every issue of Jumbo Comics. Over the years the Sheena feature was worked on by notable creators like Bob Powell, Mort Meskin, and Matt Baker. ZX-5 Spies in Action — ran for almost the entire run of the title. Ghost Gallery — ran from issue #40 until the book was cancelled. Inspector Dayton — another recurring feature that debuted in the first issue and ran until issue #60 (Feb. 1944). Hawks of the Seas — period adventure continuing a story from Quality Comics' Feature Funnies #12, after Eisner-Iger and Quality had had a falling out; the strip lasted about ten issues. Peter Pupp — originally by Bob Kane; ran for the first 25 issues. Spencer Steel — ran for the first 12 issues; also appeared in Fiction House's Fight Comics. Sky Girl — by Matt Baker; ran in issues #69-139 (November 1944–December 1952), with some of the later stories being reprints. Long Bow — Western feature which ran in issues #141-160 (Nov. 1950–June 1952), roughly concurrent with Fiction House's Long Bow series (which ran nine issues from 1951–Winter 1952/1953).

History Mitford was born at St Pancras, London, the third of four sons of barrister John Mitford (1772–1851) of the celebrated Mitford family, and his wife Sarah Mitford née Woodward (1784–1836); his grandparents were the historian William Mitford (1743–1827) and his first wife Frances \\"Fanny\\" Mitford née Molloy ( –1776). He joined the Royal Navy at an early age, and before long transferred to the Spanish service, and may have subsequently served in the British Army, but no details are available; it seems Mitford though voluble about much else, was reticent about his personal history. Mitford and his small family emigrated to South Australia, arriving aboard Katherine Stewart Forbes (Capt. Alfred Fell) in March 1839 after a long voyage of around 150 days. South Australia's future first Chief Justice, Charles Cooper, was a fellow passenger. Mitford purchased a farming property of Section 114, Marion Road near the site of the present Ascot Park school. John Crozier's \\"Oaklands\\" selection was nearby, as was Section 115 of Dr Handasyde Duncan, a fellow passenger on the Katherine Stewart Forbes. Sections 114 and 115 now comprise the suburb of Park Holme. Despite augmenting his farm income by driving a bullock team between Port Adelaide and Burra, the farming venture was not a success, and after fifteen years' toil he sold up and moved to a house on South Road, Edwardstown. He tried his hand as a miner, which turned out to be a mistake. The Tiparra and Bald Hills survey prospects in which he invested proved worthless. He claimed to have been cheated of his rights to the Moonta copper discoveries. He had been, under the nom de plume of \\"Pasquin\\", publishing forthright letters to the Telegraph advocating freedom of communication and removal of Government controls on business, and had built up a following, impressed with his liberal views and idiosyncratic writing. On 26 January 1867 the first issue of his Pasquin: Pastoral, Mineral & Agricultural Advocate appeared, price 4d. (four pence, perhaps $10 in today's values) or by subscription at 4s. (four shillings) per quarter, published by Mitford and Henry Hutchings. Mitford served as editor, lead writer and caricaturist. His vigorous, infuriating, cantankerous and aggressive but entertaining prose achieved immediate recognition and a degree of financial success. :\\"A new weekly newspaper is to be published in Adelaide on and after tomorrow morrow, the editorship of Pasquin, whose clever satirical writings in the Telegraph were very popular.\\" — Kapunda Herald 25 January 1867 :\\"Pasquin is an amusing fellow, but his writing is only likely to be relished by the intellectual portion of the community, and we rather fear he will not find his literary bantlingbantling : derogatory term for a young boy; a brat, bastard. a paying speculation.\\" — Wallaroo Times 30 January 1867 :\\"Whether people will care to pay for it at the rate of fourpence for eight quarto pages Pasquin will of course soon find out.\\" — Southern Argus 2 February 1867 In June 1867 his printer, Samuel E. Roberts of King William Street, took over the business side of the paper, leaving Mitford free to concentrate on content. It was short-lived however, as two years later while suffering from a cold, Mitford suffered a sudden relapse and died. The paper did not long outlive him; its last issue was published on the last day of 1870. > We regret to see the announcement in the daily papers that this weekly > journal of fun ceased to exist on the 31st ultimo. Those who remember the > way in which the paper originated, and the rare genius and talent with which > it had been conducted, will share with us the sorrow we express at its > extinction. It was felt from the time of the lamented decease of the late > Eustace Revely [sic] Mitford, that it would be difficult to find any > gentleman capable of worthily taking up his pen, and although many able men > have since then contributed to its columns, the want which Mitford created > has not been met since his death. Unsparing in his merciless vivisection of > all that was dishonest, hypocritical, and unjust, there was an originality > and raciness of humour in his writings which, in its way, has not been > surpassed since the days of Rabelais.

Mitford was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's on the Sturt, the Anglican church he helped to found, in what is now the Adelaide suburb of St Marys.

Bucklin (1828–1902, in other sources listed as \\"Sophronia Brecklin\\") was a nurse during the American Civil War. From Auburn, New York, Bucklin served for almost three years of the American Civil War. She worked with numerous hospitals and was present at many notable battles throughout the latter half of the war, until General Lee's surrender. Bucklin was devoted to the war effort, and though dependent on wages for her own living, felt the \\"same patriotism\\" as male volunteers.  Civil War service  At the outbreak of the war, Bucklin was in her late 20s to early 30s, living independently as a seamstress in Auburn, New York. She enlisted her services for the Union effort, and left for the front on September 17, 1862 unaccompanied. As one of the many women serving under Dorothea Dix, Bucklin's service began at the Judiciary Hospital. A mere three months later, she was transferred to a Baptist church to take care of a nurse who had become ill. Bucklin's most notable service, however, took place when she was moved to a point lookout at Chesapeake Bay for the winter. Here, she cared for men fighting at the battles of Antietam, Bull Run, and Fredericksburg. In March, Bucklin moved again to Alexandria, Virginia, and then went on to serve at Gettysburg as a field nurse. She recounts in a letter to Mary G. Holland that she was among the first to arrive at Gettysburg and one of the last to leave. Upon her arrival, Bucklin was faced with a line of soldiers awaiting surgery a mile and a half long. At the completion of Gettysburg, Bucklin spent the next seven or eight months nearby at Stoneman's Cavalry Hospital near Washington, D.C. In the winter of 1863, Bucklin came down with a fever. Her illness proved to be quite extensive, and in her aforementioned letter to Holland she writes that the other hospital staff left her for dead. Her illness, however, did not deter her from caring for patients. All in all, Bucklin completed nearly three years total of service. She recounted her wartime experiences in her 1869 book, In Hospital and Camp: A Woman's Record of Thrilling Incidents Among the Wounded in the Late War. She died in Ithaca, New York, in 1902.

[2001] Federal Judicial Scholarship 11. Over time it took on more matters and its judges were allocated a wide range of judicial tasks until it was replaced in 1977 by the Federal Court of Australia which had a more general jurisdiction covering matters arising under Australian federal law. Background From 1904 until 1956 the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration had exercised both arbitration functions, hearing and settling interstate industrial disputes by making awards,Pursuant to the (xxxv). and judicial functions such as interpreting and enforcing those awards. In the Boilermaker's case,. Affirmed on appeal ; . the High Court held that a tribunal could not create new rights such as making an award, the arbitration function, and enforce those rights, the judicial function, due to the separation of powers in the Australian Constitution. The functions of the court were split, with the judicial functions being given to the newly created Commonwealth Industrial Court and the arbitration functions being given to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1956 (Cth) File:Icons-mini-file_acrobat.gif (PDF). The six remaining judges, Sir Raymond Kelly, the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, died on 25 July 1956. were similarly split with two judges, Edward Dunphy and Sir Edward Morgan, being appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court and four, Sir Richard Kirby, Alfred Foster, Sydney Wright and Richard Ashburner being appointed to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Establishment and operation The Australian Government challenged the High Court's decision in the Boilermaker's case and obtained special leave to appeal to the Privy Council on 1 June 1956. The Australian parliament did not wait for the outcome of the appeal, passing the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which received assent on 30 June 1956. The court was formally established on 15 August 1956 and then Attorney-General John Spicer was appointed the first, and as it transpired, only, Chief Judge. Judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration had previously been appointed to act in various courts,George Dethridge and Lionel Lukin had been appointed to the Federal Court of Bankruptcy while Dethridge and Harold Piper had been appointed to the Supreme Court (ACT). This practice continued with appointments to the supreme courts of the Australian Capital Territory,All judges with the exception of Chief Judge Sir John Spicer. Christmas,Edward Dunphy. Cocos (Keeling), & Norfolk Islands.Sir Richard Eggleston, Sir Percy Joske, Edward Dunphy, Robert St John and Phillip Evatt. Sir John Spicer was appointed to the first Royal Commission into the collision between HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager, and inquiries into the aviation crashes of TAA Flight 538 (1960), Ansett-ANA Flight 325 (1961) and Ansett-ANA Flight 149 (1966). Judges were also appointed to committees to review legislation and report to parliament, such as the appointment of Sir John Spicer to the Copyright Law Review Committee, and John Kerr to the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee.. The Copyright Law Review Committee subsequently recommended the appointment of the Copyright Tribunal and Sir John Spicer was appointed as its president. When the Australian Parliament passed the Trade Practices Act in 1965, the Commonwealth Industrial Court was given power to enforce orders of the Trade Practices Tribunal, sections 4 and 68. (2007) 31(3) Melbourne University Law Review 1017. and Sir Richard Eggleston was appointed the first president of the Trade Practices Tribunal. In 1976 when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established appeals were to the Australian Industrial Court, adding yet another non- industrial matter to the Court's jurisdiction, and Gerard Brennan was appointed as the first President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Replacement by Federal Court The establishment of a federal court was proposed at least as early as 1957, and was announced by Nigel Bowen, the Attorney-General, in 1967. Bowen said that a Commonwealth superior court was necessary because the burden of work in the High Court's original jurisdiction might limit its capacity to perform its primary roles of interpreting the Constitution and as the court of ultimate appeal.. It was however another 9 years until the Federal Court was established, absorbing the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Court, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy and some of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, including appeals from the supreme courts of the territories. It was initially announced that no judge would be appointed over the age of 65, When judges were appointed to the Federal Court on 1 February 1977, two judges over the age of 65 were appointed, Sir Reginald Smithers then aged 73 and Sir John Nimmo, then aged 68. Two judges of the Australian Industrial Court were not appointed to the Federal Court, Sir Percy Joske, then aged 81 and Edward Dunphy, then aged 69.

Elevation of Jehoiachin (2 Kings 25:27–30) The fall of Jerusalem and exile of Judah (25:1–21) King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon took the last of Solomon's accumulated masses of gold and silver () as he burned Solomon's Temple, palace and much of the city of Jerusalem (). The fall of Jerusalem parallels the fall of Samaria: #Both cities were besieged three times, from two different enemies. Samaria was twice besieged by the Arameans (; ) and once by the Assyrians (), whereas Jerusalem was besieged once by the Assyrians (2 Kings 18–19) and twice by the Babylonians (; ). Each city was ultimately destroyed in its third siege. # The attacks happened after the kings of Israel and Judah revolted against powerful neighbouring regional states. The last siege of Jerusalem lasted nineteen months (, 8), until 'the people of the land' being overcome by hunger (, ; , ). Zedekiah tried to escape the city, but was captured and heavily punished (). Thereafter, Jerusalem and its remaining inhabitants suffered destruction, burning, plundering, deportation and executions (). =Verse 7= :And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. KJV * Cross references: Jeremiah 39:7; Jeremiah 52:11 * Huey notes the fulfillment of two prophecies in this verse: *# Zedekiah would see the king of Babylon and then be taken to Babylon (the prophecy recorded in Jeremiah 32:4-5; Jeremiah 34:3) *# Zedekiah would die in Babylon without being able to see that country (the prophecy recorded in Ezekiel 12:13) =Verse 8= :And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: KJV * \\"The fifth month, on seventh day\\": or the 7th of Av, was the start of the destruction of Jerusalem. According to the Talmud,Ta'anit 29a the actual destruction of the First Temple built by King Solomon began on the Ninth of Av (Tisha B'Av), and it continued to burn throughout the Tenth of Av (Jeremiah 52:12). Gill interprets that Nebuzaradan departed from Riblah on the 7th and entered Jerusalem on the 10th. The Talmud reads: :: \\"On the seventh of Av, gentiles entered the Sanctuary, and on the seventh and the eighth they ate there and desecrated it, by engaging in acts of fornication. And on the ninth, adjacent to nightfall, they set fire to it, and it continuously burned the entire day, as it is stated: \\"Woe unto us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out\\" ().T.

Governorship of Gedaliah (25:22–26) The aftermath of Jerusalem's defeat seemed to start promisingly, but ended disastrously when the Babylon- appointed governor, Gedaliah ben Ahikam ben Safan was killed by Ishmael ben Nethaniah ben Elishama of the royal family, causing the remaining inhabitants to flee to Egypt in fear of Babylonian reprisal. This passage probably is a summary of a more detailed report in Jeremiah 40–41. =Verse 25= :But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. The assassination of Gedaliah was commemorated in Fast of Gedalia, one of the fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem ().Note on 2 Kings 25:25 in NET Bible. Jehoiachin pardoned (25:27–30) Shifting the view from the land of Judah and the community in Egypt to the situation in Babylonia, the books of Kings end with a sign of hope. King Jehoiachin who was in prison since his capture in 598 BCE (attested by clay tablets from 592 BCE reporting regular provisions he received from Babylonian administrators) was pardoned and received special honor from the king of Babylon. With this passage, the editors of the books wished to stress that the history of Davidic kingdom did not end with the fate of Zedekiah and his sons (verse 7), but continue in Jehoiachin as a symbol of hope for freedom, a return to the homeland, and the restoration of the kingdom. The book of Ezekiel, written during the exile in Babylon, dated its prophecies according to Jehoiachin's regnal years (Ezekiel 1:2; 29:17; 31:1). Among his sons and grandchildren (), Zerubbabel emerged as a hopeful political figure after Babylon's decline (Ezra 2:2; ). The conclusion of the book must have been written during the reign of Evil- Merodach (562-560 BCE), as it seems unaware of the Babylonian king's demise after only two year on throne. =Verse 27= :And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison KJV * \\"Seven and thirtieth year\\": This is 26 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. 2 Kings 25.

Biography  Louise Cruppi was raised from the age of 10 years old by her grandfather, Isaac Adolphe Crémieux (1796–1880), an influential political figure during the French Second Republic known primarily for his efforts to protect and extend the human rights of French Jews. Louise Crémieux received an excellent education and had a great talent for music. She took piano lessons with Gabriel Fauré and voice lessons with Pauline Viardot. On April 20, 1882, at the age of 20, she married Jean Cruppi (1855–1933). An elected member of parliament without interruption from 1898 to 1919, Cruppi held important ministerial posts in the governments of the Third Republic. The couple had 4 children and Louise Cruppi continued her musical activities, including hosting an important musical salon in her home at 80, rue de l’Université in Paris. She encouraged Maurice Ravel in his early work and, to thank her, he dedicated his 1907 opera, L’Heure espagnole, to her. Her daughter, Amélie Cruppi, married sculptor Paul Landowski in 1913. Landowski writes with great affection about his mother-in-law in his journal (http://journal.paul-landowski.com/).  Literary career and social activism  Cruppi's first novel appeared in 1905. Avant l’heure (Ollendorff) is based on the early career of the composer Georges Bizet. In 1908 her play, Répudiée, was performed at the Théâtre Antoine. She published an essay on Swedish women writers in 1912, entitled Les Femmes écrivains aujourd’hui 1. Her second novel, La Famille Sanarens, was published by Grasset in 1921. Cruppi was a member of the jury of the prix Femina from the early 1920s until her death in 1925. In addition to her literary and musical activities, Cruppi embraced many social causes. She founded public lending libraries in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Paris, was a member of the executive committee of the Conseil National des Femmes françaises. Louise Cruppi was a long-time correspondent of Romain Rolland. Between them they exchanged over 1000 letters between 1905 and her death in 1925.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Description The greatest eclipse was at 16:21:14 UTC (12:21 local time) at 21.3°N 60.2°W northeast of Antigua and Barbuda and lasted 9 min 27 sec. The maximum width of band was 326 km (203 mi). The eclipse was visible in North America (except for the Yukon, Alaska and the northernmost part of Greenland), Central America, the Caribbean South America including, the northern parts of Peru and Bolivia and most of Brazil, the westernmost parts of Africa and Europe (westernmost Spain and Portugal, Ireland and parts of Scotland). Areas that were in the edge of the eclipse included the Galapagos Islands. In North America, it occurred in the morning, in South America, midday and in Africa and Europe, near the evening hours.

Life Richter was born in 1844. When she was in her fifties she was earning her living as a seamstress, when she reported to the police that someone had robbed her. In 1893, Richter was admitted to a Heidelberg psychiatric hospital, at the behest of her father and brothers, following what has been recorded as several acute delusional episodes. This led to her being diagnosed as paranoid and she was incarcerated for the rest of her life (26 years). Richter's legacy has survived primarily because of a small, personal jacket that she sewed during her lengthy institutionalization. Pieced together from brown wool and coarse institutional linen, the jacket is covered in messily embroidered deutsche schrift, a script which has largely fallen out of use. The lines of red, yellow, blue, orange, and white threaded text are difficult to read, overlapping and obscured through continual use. Fragments of text from Richter's jacket have been deciphered though their significance and meaning remains unclear (e.g., I am not big, I wish to read, I plunge headlong into disaster). Her case number, 583m, appears repeatedly, suggesting that the jacket may represent a biographical object. Life in German asylums at the fin- de-siecle was highly regimented. While male patients worked in the grounds or in workshops to manufacture shoes or furniture, female patients were expected to clean, sew, knit, and launder institutional uniforms and textiles. Embracing these technologies in a manner, Richter assembled both a and a in the jacket. It bears the marks of its use, including sweat stains and a darted back that may have been meant to accommodate a physical deformity or hunchback. The jacket was collected by Hans Prinzhornn in the early 20th century. Since its rediscovery in the collections in 1980, the jacket has become an iconic piece in the Prinzhorn Collection at Heidelberg. Similar examples of asylum artistry from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries include Lorina Bulwer's samplers and Myrellen's Coat.

Life Graves had two adult children and had owned a gallery and craft studio in Roxburghshire, having lived in Scotland for ten years. She had moved to Bracklesham Bay not long before the murder to look after her then 87-year- old mother Eileen. Christmas 2013 Graves, Eileen, Graves' sister, Janet, and Janet's partner, Nigel, were housesitting in Smugglers Lane, Bosham, for friends who were out of the country at the time. Several members of her family and friends visited the house over this time and enjoyed both the Christmas celebrations and Valerie’s birthday, which was on Christmas Day. =Murder= On the morning of 30 December, Janet found Graves' body in her bedroom, having suffered severe head and facial injuries. A patio door, leading directly from the bedroom outside to the back of the premises, was found to be unlocked. Investigation A few days after the murder, a hammer was found by police at the entrance to the driveway of Harts' Farm on Hoe Lane, some 600m from the murder scene. The hammer was confirmed to be the murder weapon. A local man was arrested on 14 January 2014 and questioned about the murder, but was bailed and released without further action. In November 2014, a partial DNA profile for the subject was obtained. In January 2015, Sussex Police began a voluntary mass DNA screening programme in Bosham, asking men aged 17 and over to give samples. At the time, officers had interviewed 9,500 people in relation to the case, a reward of £20,000 had been offered and the murder had been featured on Crimewatch. In July 2019 Cristian Sabou was arrested in his home in Dej, Romania on a European Arrest Warrant. Sussex Police sought his extradition. He appeared in court in Cluj-Napoca. He was extradited to the UK and is scheduled to appear before Brighton Magistrates' court on 20 July 2019. He was remanded in custody with a further court appearance scheduled for 30 September. Conviction In November 2019 Sabou was convicted of her murder after pleading guilty. The prosecutor said that Sabou had entered the house with the intent to burgle it, expecting it to be empty. He had been told that a safe in the house contained a large amount of cash and ingots. He had previously done odd jobs for the owners. When he encountered Valerie Graves he attacked her with a hammer, leaving injuries that the prosecution compared to those sustained in traffic accidents.

She worked in water-color and black-and-white, as well as genre subjects and landscapes in oils. Since coming to the United States in 1884, Hirschberg contributed every year to the exhibitions of the American Watercolor Society in New York City. One of her most effective water-colors was Maggie Tulliver in the Red Deeps, from George Eliot's \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" which she sent to the Society in 1887. Her Trysting Place was published in an etching by William Langson Lathrop, and another of her drawings entitled How de Do was engraved by Frederick E. Girsch and also published. She also illustrated for magazines. Early years and education Alice Kerr-Nelson was born in England, 12 February 1856, daughter of George W. and Emily Kerr-Nelson. She belonged to an Old county family whose pedigree in Burke's Landed Gentry dates back to Richard Nelson, who flourished in 1377. She was educated without particular attention to her artistic talents. Like every English school-girl, she took drawing lessons as part of her regular studies; but it was not till she was 21 years old, after seeing some water-colors by David Cox and William Midler in the Print Room of the British Museum, that she made any serious effort to work in that medium. At the age of 22, she sent her first picture, a water-color, to the Royal Academy. It was rejected, but it found a purchaser. She obtained leave to copy at the Museum, and then worked at Heatherley School of Fine Art in Newman Street, London. There, she began to paint heads and costumed figures, which she sold in country exhibitions in England. In the school, she met Carl Hirschberg, and they married in 1882. Career After her marriage, she studied in one of the Paris ateliers for women, and exhibited a water- color in the Salon of 1884. Hirschberg said she owed more to her husband's teaching than to the slight criticisms of Raphael Collin, who visited the women's class once a week. Hirschberg exhibited some of her work in the Salon of 1884. In the same year, the Hirschbergs removed to the United States. She exhibited the next year in the collection of the American Watercolor Society, and was a regular contributor to its exhibitions.

With a growing student body, the Culinary Institute purchased a former Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971 and bachelor's degrees in 1993. The school opened its St. Helena campus in 1995, its Texas campus in 2008, its Singapore campus in 2010, and its Napa campus in 2016.  Beginnings: 1947–1969  The New Haven Restaurant Institute was founded by the New Haven Restaurant Association, with the assistance of culinary educator Frances Roth and Katharine Angell in New Haven, Connecticut. The vocational training school, intended for returning World War II veterans, held its first classes on May 22, 1946. Roth became the first Administrative Director, and Angell became the first President and Chairman of the Board, serving from 1946 to 1966. She built the school's relations with New Haven and especially close ties with Yale University. The first graduating class consisted of fifty students and three faculty: a dietitian, a baker, and a chef. Originally housed in a storefront in New Haven, the school moved in 1947. With assistance from Yale University, the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven's Prospect Hill neighborhood, spending $75,000. The building, known as Angell Hall after James Rowland Angell, had a private chapel, as Angell found important for cooking schools. The building was joined by the adjacent Taft Mansion, now demolished. In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute; the school's name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951.  Relocation and early history  Enrollment grew to approximately 1,000 students by 1969, beyond the capacity of its original campus, so the school sold the New Haven property to Yale and purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. The 5-story, 150-room building was purchased along with 80 acres for $1 million. Following the purchase, the school began a $4 million renovation. On November 19, 1971, the New York State Board of Regents granted the college its absolute charter incorporating a board of trustees and associates. The following year, the Board of Regents granted a charter for the college to begin awarding associate degrees. It began operating at the Hyde Park location in 1972. In 1973, the school opened the Epicurean Room, later named the Escoffier Restaurant, which had a three-star New York Times rating and four stars on the Mobil Travel Guide. In 1974 the college built three residence halls, housing 880 students total. A fourth residence hall, Hudson Hall, was built in 1896 housing 350 students. Early in 1988, following a $1.5 million grant, the school built the General Foods Nutrition Center, housing the student-run St. Andrew's Cafe. That year the school also opened its Takaki School of Baking and Pastry building, holding three bakeshops, four pastry shops, four kitchens, and four lecture halls. In 1993, the school was granted approval from the Board of Regents to establish two bachelors of professional studies degrees, and the school also opened its library building and Danny Kaye Theater. It was granted a $1.5 million gift from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. In July 1998, the Student Recreation Center opened.  Recent history: 2000–present  The Colavita Center houses the Ristorante Caterina de' Medici Copia, now the CIA at Copia campus The Apple Pie Bakery Café opened in 2000, and the Colavita Center opened the following year. More residence halls were built at the school's Hyde Park campus in 2004. In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility on the campus of Temasek Polytechnic. In 2012, the CIA began offering a bachelor's degree program in culinary science, and in 2014 introduced a bachelor's degree in applied food studies. In 2015, the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students, called The Egg. Both are housed in the CIA's Student Commons building. In the same year, the college acquired a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa, California that operated from 2001 to 2008. In 2016, the college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The college, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, purchased the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million (it was recently assessed for $21.3 million). In September 2016, the college replaced its Bachelor of Professional Studies business management program with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree program in food business management. On April 23, 2008, amid complaints directed toward CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved a vote of no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, laid out in a thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, substandard school-bland kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. As a result of the event and changes made, the board confirmed unanimously their confidence in him and extended his contract. Following the approval, students began organizing a protest, including creating several student groups on Facebook, and hanging \\"Fire Tim Ryan\\" signs in dorm rooms. The students described further complaints including the administration's close ties with the corporate food industry and less challenging kitchen tasks, such as frying frozen waffle fries. In May the school prevented the campus newspaper from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. The school later apologized and allowed a full report in the paper's next issue. Ryan held that he was trying to prevent students from being involved in a conflict between the faculty and administration. On April 23, 2013, About 90 students left classes to protest a recent trend of less enforcement of a school policy. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front- of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them. In May 2017, the college announced it will be offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Hospitality Management starting September 2018. Demographics The number of enrolled women has been increasing since the school opened in 1946, with its first graduating class having one woman among 50 students. By 1980, 20% of students were female, which rose to 30% by 2000 and 40% by 2006. In 2017, women became the majority at the school, with 51.6% of students. Although it is often cited that women were not admitted to the school until 1970, there was one women in the first class held, four in the next, and more in almost every class since then. From 1966 to 1971, women were not admitted, with the stated reason of limited facilities on their New Haven campus.

It is bordered by Paris Road/Highway 47 to the East, Downman Road to the West, and Interstate 10 and Morrison Road to the South. The name in French, \\"La Petite Bois\\" or The Little Woods can be found on the 1883 Lafon-Alphonse Michoud Map drafted by civil-engineer George N. Grandjean. \\"Little Woods\\", as a place designation that continues in local use. Little Woods also directly relates to the treed hammocks that were high Chénier ridges bordered by water and wetlands.  Geological formation  During the late Pleistocene or early Post-Pleistocene age, deltaic processes formed the beaches on the southshore of Lake Pontchartrain. Due to restricted flow resulting from the Pine Island trend, a series of 4600-year old barrier islands were formed. The discoveries of the Pine Island Beach Trend were compiled by Saucier (1963).http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/la/geology/Saucier-1963.pdf Previously, Rowett (1957) identified 87 species of mollusks here. He also established that there was a molluscan assemblage indicative of the conditions of deposition found on the shallow continental shelf described by Parker (1956).  Archaeological remains  Archaeological exploration of the Little Woods Middens led to discoveries of pot sherds and pumice, while burial sites uncovered quartz crystals and bones, no C14 data was collected. Cultural and geologic evidence collected from shell middens indicate this area was inhabited from 500 BCE to 1 CE during the Tchula period. The Tchefuncte Culture existed in the Early Woodland Period and were the first commonly making pottery from the native clay. Major excavations of shell deposits were directed by Maurice Weil in 1934 as part of a CWA project, followed by J. Richard Czajcowski as part of a large LSU New Deal Project. The sites at Little Woods are 16OR1-5, near to the site are two other sites Paris Road 16OR15 and Haughs Canal 16OR28. Of these sites only a few remain today. https://www.nolaenvironmental.gov/nola_public_data/projects/usace_levee/docs/original/draftier6.pdf  Early exploration and development  René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, or Robert de La Salle (1643 – 1687) noted among his discoveries that the natives in Louisiana lived on pier like structures. Later, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, Sieur d'Iberville, or Sieur d'Iberville et d'Ardillières (1661 –1706) explored the area for trade, from this time, King Louis XIV of France had a trading agreement with the local natives. A road was planned by Pierre Denis de la Ronde (1762 - 1824), the planned road went from Little Woods to the town of Versailles in St. Bernard Parish he envisioned a canal linking Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River along what is now Paris Road. In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte sold the Louisiana territories to the Spain.  Early development  By 1882, Little Woods was part of the Lafon-Alphonse Michaud Plantation and a railroad was being constructed to link New Orleans as part of New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad. The longest train trestle bridge in the world was constructed.https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/47th- congress/session-1/c47s1ch291.pdf Railroad workers built section houses along the track and switched the passing trains onto the single track trestle, therefore, Little Woods became a whistle stop where trains would wait to cross the bridge. The train route leaving New Orleans to Little Woods is described in a newspaper article from 1887. A large wooden dancing platform on piers is noted, also camps had thatched Palmetto roofs, people fished and sold their seafood in the city. In 1908 a train wreck occurred, one evening at the Little Woods Station two trains collided in the fog killing prominent figures of the community. One of the twelve victims was Jacob Salmen of The Salmen Brothers Brick and Lumber Company who later succumbed to his injuries.  The Roaring Twenties  Louis Armstrong recalled, on page 47 of his autobiography, Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans, in 1913 at 13 years old, he was made a band leader and was sent to play at Milneberg and Little Woods.https://archive.org/stream/satchmomylifeinn002187mbp/satchmomylifeinn002187mbp_djvu.txt By the 1920s hundreds of camps ranged from Milneberg at West End to Little Woods in the East. Little Woods had become a vacation resort, Ragtime and early Jazz, called Ragajazz, was the music of the day.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064020/1921-04-28/ed- 1/seq-1/ Heard in the area were bands like Kid Stevenson Jazz Hounds, Alcide yellow Nunez of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, and Froggy's Moonlight Serenaders.

Jason can also exit the tank to explore various areas into which the tank cannot venture. In addition to redone graphics and sound, Blaster Master Zero also adds various tweaks and features not seen in the NES game. Blaster Master Zero 2 was announced in March 2019. It was released on March 20, 2019 on Nintendo Switch and November 29, 2019 on Microsoft Windows., and was released for PS4 on June 29, 2020. Gameplay The game plays similarly to the NES original. Players control the SOPHIA vehicle in the side- scrolling levels, exploring environments and defeating enemies using the tank's various weapons. The player character Jason can also hop out of the tank to enter various passages and doors, where the view switches to an overhead perspective. Players can find various upgrades to the tank that may allow access to previously inaccessible areas. Throughout the game the player also encounters various boss characters that must be defeated to progress to later levels. A multiplayer mode allows a second player to take control of an aiming reticle to shoot at enemies. Plot and setting The game combines plot elements and character names from the original Blaster Master, its Worlds of Power novelization, as well as the Japanese version of the game, Metafight. In a distant future, earth falls into an ice age, after countless wars and environmental disasters. Due to the ice age, the human race was forced to live underground. When the ice age came to an end, humanity began making methods they learned while living underground to restore the planet and the environment. During that time, a large, mysterious comet fell to the earth, but that did not hinder their effort to restore the lost ecosystems, and humans were able to live on the earth's surface once again. Several hundred years later, Jason Frudnick, a young genius in the field of robotics, finds an unusual-looking and frog-like creature that he names Fred. His research is interrupted when Fred escapes into a wormhole that seemed to appear from nowhere, and Jason finds himself inside one of the underground environments from the past, where he encounters an armored tank named SOPHIA III, which he proceeds to use in order to fend off against the mutants that suddenly took over the underground and locate Fred. During his quest, Jason finds an unconscious girl named Eve, who has a strange connection to SOPHIA III. Together, they find and rescue Fred, whereupon Jason finds out that both Eve and Fred are actually aliens. Fred is a probe sent by the inhabitants of Eve's planet to locate the Mutants, who are alien invaders that once attempted to conquer her planet, whereas Eve is an android created to serve as pilot and support of SOPHIA III. Together, they defeat the Underworld Lord, who was the leader of the Mutants. In the basic ending, Eve thanks Jason and leaves Earth with the tank and, unbeknownst to Jason, somberly destroys herself along with it. If the player has collected all of SOPHIA III's weapon and upgrade chips, and all of the area maps, then an extended ending is unlocked. After the battle, Eve knocks Jason unconscious and leaves with SOPHIA III to defeat the true leader of the Mutants, the Mutant Core, alone. Fred uses his ability to create wormholes to take Jason to a base where he finds a new tank, the SOPHIA ZERO, a far more powerful version of the SOPHIA III. Eventually, Jason finds the Mutant Core, which has taken over and corrupted the SOPHIA III with Eve trapped inside of it. Jason fights and disables the corrupted SOPHIA III long enough to rescue Eve and destroys the SOPHIA III and the Mutant Core along with it. In the end, Eve finds out that SOPHIA ZERO was created for her by Kane and Jennifer Gardner, Eve's parents/creators. Eve is truly thankful for Jason that not only he saved the planet but also be there for her. The game ends with Jason watching the scenery, now filled with greenery, with Eve and Fred perched atop of SOPHIA ZERO.  Development  Two months after the game's release, Inti Creates released a patch for the game that added a new \\"Destroyer Mode\\", a harder difficulty setting available after players beat the game. They also announced the release of two DLC characters, Gunvolt from the company's Azure Striker Gunvolt and Ekoro from Gal*Gun, another Inti Creates title. Guest characters Shantae and Shovel Knight were subsequently announced in July. An update released in October 2017 added a boss rush game mode. Reception The game has received largely positive reviews. It received praise for its retro art style and being largely faithful to the original game, with Destructoid calling it \\"a loving recreation that serves as both a companion and in some ways a replacement for the original.\\" However, the game was also criticized for not improving enough over the original as well as being too easy. IGN's Tristan Ogilvie commented that the game \\"never offers an old-school level of adversity to match its charmingly chunky 8-bit aesthetic\\", while Game Informer called it \\"a blast from the past that feels like a bit of a relic.\\" By October 2017, Inti Creates reported over 110,000 sales for the game.

According to Jewish tradition, they were accepted by Moses as an integral part of the people. Their influence is said to have been involved in the golden calf and other incidents where the people questioned Moses and his laws. Etymology According to contemporary Jewish Orthodox commentary Da'at Miqra, the words roughly correspond to the \\"mixed many\\", while Targum Onkelos translates it as \\"many foreigners\\". The term appears in Exodus 12:38: \\"A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers, both flocks and herds\\" (NRSV). The \\"mixed crowd\\" is an English rendering of Erev Rav. While Exodus 12:38 is the only mention of the complete term Erev Rav in the entire Tanakh, the term Erev by itself (which also means evening in Hebrew),In Hebrew spelling without niqqud (vowel-points) the erev for evening and the erev for \\"mixed\\" are spelled identically. However, the first vowel in the two words is written and pronounced differently: evening has a segol, while mixed has a tzere. also appears in Nehemiah 13:3, where it is used to refer to non-Jews.Bar, Shaul. \\"Who Were The Mixed Multitudes?\\" Hebrew Studies, vol. 49, 2008, pp. 27–39., (www.jstor.org/stable/27913875). Biblical scholar Shaul Bar has suggested that the term may have referred specifically to foreign mercenaries who intermarried with the Israelite people in Egypt. In modern Hebrew, it is used as an idiom for a mixture that exists outside of Judaism, especially in reference to non-Jews. Jewish tradition According to the Arizal, in every generation, the souls of the Erev Rav are reincarnated in numerous individuals. The Zohar, which is the foundational text for Kabbalistic thought, says the Erev Rav not only exists in each generation, but it continues to be the cause for most of the problems affecting the Jewish people.The initial letters of the words Rosh Bnei Yisrael (ראש בני ישראל, the heads of the Jewish people) spell ReBY ( רבי, teacher). This indicates that the Jews require a qualified teacher to transmit God’s message. The initial letters of the words Rasha'im Ba-choshekh Yidamu (רשעים בחשך ידמו, the wicked are cut off in darkness) (I Samuel 2: 9) also spell ReBY (רבי) (Likutey Moharan I, 111). In this case, it is a reference to unworthy people who wrest the leadership of the Jews from genuine teachers. These false leaders, who are referred to as the “mixed multitude,” will eventually be “cut off.” And then, the Zohar (III, 297b) teaches: “When the mixed multitude leaves the presence of the Jews, the verse ‘Count the heads of the Jewish people’ will be fulfilled” Currently, the term \\"Erev Rav\\" is used by Jews in a derogatory manner describing someone who is perceived as a traitor.

His poems include motifs like childhood memories, love, landscapes and dreamworld, and in his last collection of poetry also his personal death and mankind's sufferings. Together with Uuno Kailas, Sarkia was the most prominent Finnish poet of the 1930s. As Kailas, his poetry also had homosexual themes. Sarkia published four collections of poetry between 1929 and 1943. In addition to his own works, Sarkia was known as a translator of French and Italian poetry. Sarkia was also a contemporary member of the Finnish literary group Tulenkantajat. Sarkia never had a permanent home or regular job and he used to spend terms in sanatoriums. Sarkia died of tuberculosis at the age of 43.  Life  Sarkia was born in the municipality of Kiikka, Satakunta in southwest Finland as an illegitimate child of the maid Aleksandra Sulin. Sarkia's father was most likely the local carpenter Malakias Korkki. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1916 and Sarkia moved to live with his godmother Hilda Runni. With a help of his grandparents Sarkia was able to finish the secondary school in Tyrvää. During his schoolyears, Sarkia got interested in poetry and also became aware of his homosexuality. Sarkia learned French and German in Tyrvää, where he lived by the local pharmacist whose wife was born in Switzerland. Sarkia graduated from the secondary school in 1923 and accomplished his military service in the Hennala Garrison in the spring of 1924. He worked for a year as a tutor in Rantasalmi and entered the University of Helsinki in 1925. In Helsinki Sarkia lived in cheap accommodation, suffered from poverty and was hospitalized several times for the tuberculosis he caught during the military service. In 1926 he received a scholarship and made a short trip to Germany. A year later he began studies at the University of Turku, joining the literary circle of V. A. Koskenniemi. His first collection, Kahlittu (″Chained″) was released in 1929. The second collection, Velka elämälle (″The Debt to Life″) in 1931, included the poem Antinous, which dealt with homoerotic love. Antinous was the lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The title poem was about love and desertion, dedicated to his mother. His two first collections did not cause much attention, but Sarkia became known for his translation of Arthur Rimbaud's Le Bateau ivre in 1932. In December 1933 Sarkia had a job at the university library in Turku, where the chief librarian was the writer Volter Kilpi. Just a month later, Sarkia tried to commit suicide with an oversdose of barbiturate. Sarkia's third book, Unen kaivo (″The Well of Dreams″, 1936), was a commercial and critical success. The collection included the poem Barcarola, which is influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's Die Sonne sinkt. It has been described as one of his most wonderful poems. In 1937, Sarkia traveled to Switzerland where he spent several months. He also visited Rome where Sarkia kept a speech against Hitler and was arrested. The grave of Kaarlo Sarkia in Helsinki. Sarkia never graduated from the universities of Helsinki or Turku. In the early 1943, Sarkia lived a couple of months in the small village of Sysmä, but moved soon to Helsinki, as the state granted him a pension. Sarkia also received a monthly payment from his publisher WSOY. At this time, Sarkia was already seriously ill. His fourth book, Kohtalon vaaka (″The Scale of Fate″) came out the same year, in the middle of the World War II, when Finland was fighting as an ally of Nazi Germany. Sarkia did not join the writers who produced patriotic propaganda. Instead, the collection featured several pacifist and anti-war poems. As a result, Sarkia was criticized for being unpatriotic. In 1944 Sarkia edited his collections into a single volume Runot (″The Poems″). As the war ended, Sarkia travelled to Sweden for a period at a local sanatorium. Sarkia never made it to the hospital, but spent his time in a Stockholm hotel. When Sarkia returned Finland, he went to Sysmä to the care of two sisters with whom he had become acquainted. Sarkia died there of tuberculosis in November 1945 at the age of 43. He was buried to the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.  Importance  According to the Finnish writer Tuomas Anhava, Sarkia occupies same position in the history of Finnish poetry that John Keats has in English and Alfred de Musset in French poetry. Sarkia has been described as a ″composer of words″ as his poems are known of their euphony and rhythm. Many of Sarkia's poems have been set to music, by composers like Erik Bergman and Kaj Chydenius. His poetry has even influenced on the lyrics of the Finnish death metal group Insomnium. Among the poets he translated were Arthur Rimbaud, François Villon, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire and Gabriele D’Annunzio. Sarkia's translation of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal has been praised of its rich imagery and rhythmical experimentations. Another famous translation is the Finnish version of Rimbaud's Le Bateau ivre, which is considered ″brilliant″. Sarkia's poems have never been published as a separate book in English. In 2008, the literary magazine Poetry Salzburg Review published some English translations by Pentti M. Rautaharju, a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Minnesota.  Commemoration  The literary society Sarkia-Seura was established in 1952. The Sarkia museum was opened in 1959 in the house where Sarkia lived with his godmother after his mother had died. Sarkia's statue was erected to his birthplace Kiikka in 1960. It is a work of the Finnish sculptor Kauko Räike. In 2010, the artistic residence Villa Sarkia, run by the literary society Nuoren Voiman Liitto, was opened in Sysmä. There is a street commemorating Kaarlo Sarkia in Vermonniitty (Espoo) named Kaarlo Sarkian katu. Streets commemorating other 1930s artists Uuno Kailas and Anna Sahlstén are also found nearby.

The prefix “Muthu”, literally means “pearl”. \\"Mari\\" means rain and \\"Amman\\" means mother in Tamil language. The temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of rain and fertility.  History  The land was originally part of a paddy field and was gifted by the owner in 1852. The current temple was built in 1874, funded by the Nattukkottai Chettiar. This temple is used by both Hindus and Buddhists. The temple was originally a small statue under a tree prayed to by the Hindu people but has been developed by the people in Matale. The temple was severely damaged during the anti-Tamil riots in July 1983 but has been subsequently restored. One of the most visually dominant features of this temple is its high Gopuram ('Raja Koburum'), a large decorated tower located above the main northern gateway ('Vadakku Vaayil') to the temple. The Raja Koburum is one of the largest Gopurams in Sri Lanka. The 1008 statues of Hindu deities are the work of South Indian sculptor, Nagalingam and his son Ramanathan, with the help of about 100 designers, painters and architects from Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The Raja Koburum was completed in 2007 at the cost of approximately Rs 150M.  Special events  The main religious festivals including the chariot festival at the temple are celebrated during February or March. The temple has five ornate chariots, which are used to convey statues of Hindu deities around the city on 'Ther' or 'Vettai Thiruvizha', the chariot ceremony day, which is held the day before 'Medin Poya' (the Poya day in March).  Wedding hall  There is a large wedding hall for the Hindu people. This wedding hall has been in use from 1856 to the present.

Cannabis has served as an entheogen—a chemical substance used in religious or spiritual contexts—in the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. Cannabis has been used by shamanic and pagan cultures to ponder deeply religious and philosophical subjects related to their tribe or society, to achieve a form of enlightenment, to unravel unknown facts and realms of the human mind and subconscious, and also as an aphrodisiac during rituals or orgies.Sayin, H. U. (2014). The Consumption of Psychoactive Plants in Ancient Global and Anatolian Cultures During Religious Rituals: The Roots of the Eruption of Mythological Figures and Common Symbols in Religions and Myths. NeuroQuantology, 12(2). There are several references in Greek mythology to a powerful drug that eliminated anguish and sorrow. Herodotus wrote about early ceremonial practices by the Scythians, thought to have occurred from the 5th to 2nd century BCE. Itinerant Hindu saints have used it in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Over the last few decades hundreds of archaeological and anthropological items of evidence have come out of Mexican, Mayan and Aztec cultures that suggest cannabis, along with magic mushrooms (psilocybin), peyote (mescaline) and other psychoactive plants were used in cultural shamanic and religious rituals. Mexican-Indian communities occasionally use cannabis in religious ceremonies by leaving bundles of it on church altars to be consumed by the attendees.Warf, B. (2014), High Points: An Historical Geography of Cannabis. Geogr Rev, 104: 414-438. doi:10.1111/j.1931-0846.2014.12038.x  Indian subcontinent  Bhang eaters from India c. 1790. Bhang is an edible preparation of cannabis native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by Hindus in ancient India. The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda estimated to have been written sometime around 2000–1400 BCE, which mentions cannabis as one of the \\"five sacred plants... which release us from anxiety\\" and that a guardian angel resides in its leaves. The Vedas also refer to it as a \\"source of happiness,\\" \\"joy-giver\\" and \\"liberator,\\" and in the Raja Valabba, the gods send hemp to the human race so that they might attain delight, lose fear and have sexual desires. Many households in India own and grow a cannabis plant to be able to offer cannabis to a passing sadhu (ascetic holy men), and during some evening devotional services it is not uncommon for cannabis to be smoked by everyone present.Touw, M. (1981). The religious and medicinal uses of Cannabis in China, India and Tibet. Journal of psychoactive drugs, 13(1), 23-34. A sadhu, or holy person, smoking cannabis in Kolkata, India. Cannabis was often consumed in weddings or festivals honoring Shiva, who is said to have brought it down from the Himalayas. It is still offered to Shiva in temples on Shivaratri day, while devotional meetings called bhajans, although not necessarily associated with Shiva, are occasions for devotees to consume the drug liberally. Yogis or sadhus along with other Hindu mystics have been known to smoke a mixture of cannabis sativa and tobacco in order to enhance meditation. This is particularly common during the festival of Diwali and Kumbha Mela. There are three types of cannabis used in the Indian subcontinent. The first, bhang, a type of cannabis edible, consists of the leaves and plant tops of the marijuana plant. It is usually consumed as an infusion in beverage form, and varies in strength according to how much cannabis is used in the preparation. The second, ganja, consisting of the leaves and the plant tops, is smoked. The third, called charas or hashish, consists of the resinous buds and/or extracted resin from the leaves of the marijuana plant. Typically, bhang is the most commonly used form of cannabis in religious festivals. In Tantric Buddhism, which originated in the Tibeto- Himalayan region, cannabis serves as an important part of a traditional ritual (which may or may not also include sexual intercourse). Cannabis is taken to facilitate meditation and also heighten awareness of all aspects of the ceremony, with a large oral dosage being taken in time with the ceremony so that the climax of the \\"high\\" coincides with the climax of the ceremony. Ancient China The sinologist and historian Joseph Needham concluded \\"the hallucinogenic properties of hemp were common knowledge in Chinese medical and Taoist circles for two millennia or more\\",Joseph Needham and Gwei-djen Lu (1974). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality. Cambridge University Press, p. 152 and other scholars associated Chinese wu (shamans) with the entheogenic use of cannabis in Central Asian shamanism.\\"Before the Christian Era\\" from The oldest texts of Traditional Chinese Medicine listed herbal uses for cannabis and noted some psychodynamic effects. The (ca. 100 CE) Chinese pharmacopeia Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica) described the use of mafen 麻蕡 \\"cannabis fruit/seeds\\": A Taoist priest in the fifth century A.D. wrote in the Ming-I Pieh Lu that: Later pharmacopia repeated this description, for instance the (ca. 1100 CE) Zhenglei bencao 證類本草 (\\"Classified Materia Medica\\"): The (ca. 730) dietary therapy book Shiliao bencao 食療本草 (\\"Nutritional Materia Medica\\") prescribes daily consumption of cannabis in the following case: \\"those who wish to see demons should take it (with certain other drugs) for up to a hundred days.\\" Yangshao culture (ca. 4800 BCE) amphora with hemp cord design Cannabis has been cultivated in China since Neolithic times, for instance, hemp cords were used to create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery). Early Chinese classics have many references to using the plant for clothing, fiber, and food, but none to its psychotropic properties. Some researchers think Chinese associations of cannabis with \\"indigenous central Asian shamanistic practices\\" can explain this \\"peculiar silence\\".Touw, Mia (1981). \\"The Religious and Medicinal Uses of Cannabis in China, India, and Tibet\\" , Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 13.1:23-34, p 23. The botanist Li Hui- lin noted linguistic evidence that the \\"stupefying effect of the hemp plant was commonly known from extremely early times\\"; the word ma \\"cannabis; hemp\\" has connotations of \\"numbed; tingling; senseless\\" (e.g., mamu 麻木 \\"numb\\" and mazui 麻醉 \\"anesthetic; narcotic\\"), which \\"apparently derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes.\\"Li (1973), p. 297-298. Li suggested shamans in Northeast Asia transmitted the medical and spiritual uses of cannabis to the ancient Chinese wu 巫 \\"shaman; spirit medium; doctor\\". Robert Clarke and Mark Merlin, the authors of Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany, suggest that: Ancient Central Asia The (ca. 440 BCE) Greek Histories of Herodotus record the early Scythians using cannabis steam baths. What Herodotus called the \\"hemp-seed\\" must have been the whole flowering tops of the plant, where the psychoactive resin is produced along with the fruit (\\"seeds\\"). Herodotus also noted that the Thracians, a people who had intimate contact with the Scythians, introduced the plant to the Dacians where it became popular among a shamanic cult named the Kapnobatai, or \\"Those Who Walk in the Clouds.\\" The shamans of the cult, also called Kapnobatai, were known to use hemp smoke to induce visions and trances. Burial tombs of the Phrygians and Scythians frequently contained cannabis sativa seeds. Several of the Tarim mummies excavated near Turpan in Xinjiang province of Northwestern China were buried with sacks of cannabis next to their heads. Based on additional grave goods, archaeologists concluded these individuals were shamans: \\"The marijuana must have been buried with the dead shamans who dreamed of continuing the profession in another world.\\" A team of scientists analyzed one shamanistic tomb that contained a leather basket with well-preserved cannabis (789 grams of leaves, shoots, and fruits; AMS dated 2475 ± 30 years BP) and a wooden bowl with cannabis traces. Lacking any \\"suitable evidence that the ancient, indigenous people utilized Cannabis for food, oil, or fiber\\", they concluded \\"the deceased was more concerned with the intoxicant and/or medicinal value of the Cannabis remains.\\" The Chinese archaeologist Hongen Jiang and his colleagues excavated a circa 2,400-2,800 BP tomb in northwest China's Turpan Basin and found the remains of an approximately 35-year-old man with Caucasian features who had been buried with thirteen 1-meter cannabis plants, placed diagonally across his chest. Jiang said this is the first archeological discovery of complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a burial shroud.Hongen Jiang et al. (2016), \\"Ancient Cannabis Burial Shroud in a Central Eurasian Cemetery\\", Economic Botany 70.3: 213-221.Kristin Romey, Ancient Cannabis 'Burial Shroud' Discovered in Desert Oasis, National Geographic, 4 October 2016. Cannabis has been associated with Central Asian burial rituals around the 5th century BCE, as archaeological excavations in 1947 of a series of burial mounds at Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of Siberia revealed 1.2 meter- high wooden frame tents in each of the mounds. Each frame surrounded a bronze vessel filled with the remains of hemp seeds and stones, and were presumably left smoking in the grave. In one of the mounds, a leather pouch containing hemp seeds, and scattered hemp, coriander, and melilotus seeds were also recovered.Merlin M. D. Archaeological evidence for the tradition of psychoactive plant use in the old world. Economic Botany, 2003; 57(3): 295–323. More recent excavations indicate the cannabis used in the most ancient burials were devoid of THC, while significantly stronger psychoactive cannabis was employed at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains. Historical Africa According to Alfred Dunhill (1924), Africans have had a long tradition of smoking hemp in gourd pipes, asserting that by 1884 the King of the Baluka tribe of the Congo had established a \\"riamba\\" or hemp-smoking cult in place of fetish-worship. Enormous gourd pipes were used.[Dunhill, Alfred  \\"The Pipe Book\\"  London  A & C Black, 1924] Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and relieve pain of hemorrhoids. It was also used as an antiseptic. In a number of countries, it was used to treat tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions, neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia, rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted labor during childbirth. In Africa, there were a number of cults and sects of hemp worship. Pogge and Wissman, during their explorations of 1881, visited the Bashilenge, living on the northern borders of the Lundu, between Sankrua and Balua. They found large plots of land around the villages used for the cultivation of hemp. Originally there were small clubs of hemp smokers, bound by ties of friendship, but these eventually led to the formation of a religious cult. The Bashilenge called themselves Bena Riamba, \\"the sons of hemp\\", and their land Lubuku, meaning friendship. They greeted each other with the expression \\"moio\\", meaning both \\"hemp\\" and \\"life.\\" Each tribesman was required to participate in the cult of Riamba and show his devotion by smoking as frequently as possible. They attributed universal magical powers to hemp, which was thought to combat all kinds of evil and they took it when they went to war and when they traveled. There were initiation rites for new members which usually took place before a war or long journey. The hemp pipe assumed a symbolic meaning for the Bashilenge somewhat analogous to the significance which the peace pipe had for American Indians. No holiday, no trade agreement, no peace treaty was transacted without it. In the middle Sahara region, the Senusi sect also cultivated hemp on a large scale for use in religious ceremonies.Wissman et al. 1888 Germanic paganism In ancient Germanic paganism, cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. The harvesting of the plant was connected with an erotic high festival. It was believed that Freya lived as a fertile force in the plant's feminine flowers and by ingesting them one became influenced by this divine force. Linguistics offers further evidence of prehistoric use of cannabis by Germanic peoples: The word hemp derives from Old English hænep, from Proto-Germanic *hanapiz, from the same Scythian word that cannabis derives from. The etymology of this word follows Grimm's Law by which Proto-Indo-European initial *k- becomes *h- in Germanic. The shift of *k→h indicates it was a loanword into the Germanic parent language at a time depth no later than the separation of Common Germanic from Proto-Indo-European, about 500 BC. The Celts may have also used cannabis, as evidence of hashish traces were found in Hallstatt, birthplace of Celtic culture. Also, the Dacians and the Scythians had a tradition where a fire was made in an enclosed space and cannabis seeds were burnt and the resulting smoke ingested.  Middle East  There exist reports that cannabis was ritually consumed by a Sufi sect called Melamis, and also in the cult of Hassan Sabbah, or the Hashshashin. The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Hebrews, among other Semitic cultures of the Middle East, mostly acquired cannabis from Aryan cultures and have burned it as an incense as early as 1000 BC. In Egypt, cannabis pollen was recovered from the tomb of Ramses II, who governed for sixty‐seven years during the 19th dynasty, and several mummies contain trace cannabinoids. Cannabis oil was likely used throughout the Middle East for centuries before and after the birth of Christ. It is mentioned in the original Hebrew Old Testament and in its Aramaic translations as both incense and as intoxicant. Cannabis, as an incense, was used in the temples of Assyria and Babylon because \\"its aroma was pleasing to the Gods.\\" In Exodus 30:23 of the Bible, God directed Moses to make a holy oil composed of “myrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm and kassia”. The root kan has two meanings in many Ancient languages; hemp and reed. In numerous translations of the original Hebrew Bible, kaneh bosm has been erroneously translated as “calamus” or “aromatic reed,” when the actual translation is closer to hemp. This error appears in translations as early as the third century B.C in Septuagint, the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and also appears in following translations such as Martin Luther's.
