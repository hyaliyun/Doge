Born in Dauphin, Manitoba, Lemieux was an ice hockey defenceman and was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins 110th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft. Lemieux started with the Dauphin Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, helping the Kings to the Manitoba championship in 1971-72. He played for the Green Bay Bobcats in the United States Hockey League for the 1974-75 season (scoring seven goals and eighteen assists), but was never called up to the NHL. He later coached girls' hockey in Lorette, Manitoba and St. Adolphe. After leaving hockey, Lemieux received a Bachelor of Arts in 1979 and a Bachelor of Education in 1985 from the University of Winnipeg. He completed post-baccalaureate work in education at the University of Manitoba. He worked as a teacher for several years, coaching various high school teams and holding positions in the teacher's association. In the provincial election of 1999, Lemieux was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the rural riding of La Verendrye, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Ben Sveinson by 3533 votes to 3367. Lemieux's victory was something of an upset, as it occurred in a riding which had never before been won by the New Democratic Party or its social-democratic predecessors (despite having existed since 1879). In the 2003 election, Lemieux was re- elected with 58% of the riding's vote. On October 5, 1999, Lemieux was appointed Minister of Consumer of Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act. He was relieved of the latter responsibility on July 4, 2000; after a cabinet shuffle on January 17, 2001, he was appointed Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism with responsibility for Sport. Lemieux has since been \\"shuffled\\" two further times: he became Minister of Education and Youth on September 25, 2002, and Minister of Transportation and Government Services on November 4, 2003. In September 2006 he was appointed Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation in Gary Doer's new cabinet. In October 2013 Lemieux was named Minister of Tourism, Culture, Sport and Consumer Protection. Lemieux has described his political views as being closer to Tony Blair's \\"New Labour\\" than to traditional democratic socialism. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party. He was re-elected in the 2007 and 2011 provincial elections.

She has been most notably played by Taylor Miller who exited the role in 1996. Miller returned for a special cameo in 2010, following the death of her father Palmer Cortlandt. Storylines =Arrival= Nina Cortlandt was her father's daughter; not that she had much of a choice after her mother died in childbirth. For as long as she could remember, she suffered from many ailments, most notably diabetes. The pressure of her recent move to Pine Valley made her ignore her health. At a party thrown in honor of the Cortlandts at the Tyler Estate, Nina fainted as a result of appendicitis. =Cliff and Nina = When Nina awoke, she saw the face of a handsome doctor, Cliff Warner. It was love at first sight. They began dating, but Palmer did not approve of Cliff. Palmer threw Nina a lavish 18th birthday party at Cortlandt Manor. The elite of Pine Valley were invited. Un known to Nina, Myra Murdock, the Cortlandt's housekeeper, was really Nina's grandmother. Myra phoned Nina'a Mom, who was not dead after all. Daisy had fled Palmer's wrath when he found out she was having an affair. Daisy was so incredibly sad to not be able to raise her daughter, but kept tabs on Nina by staying in touch with her mother, Myra. When Myra called to tell her Palmer was trying to interfere with Cliff and Nina, Daisy came into town to defend her daughter and Cliff's love. Myra had a seance where Nina was able to communicate with her \\"dead mother\\" who encouraged Nina to follow her heart. Daisy dressed up in a beautiful dress and mask for the costume ball and was able to be in the same room as her daughter for the first time in years. Palmer sensed her being there and sought her out in the stables on the property and tried to force her out of hiding with his growling dobermans. Nina and Cliff's love grew and grew. As they fell in love, Palmer jealously started to plot against them. When he found out his daughter had Nina had diabetic retinopathy he told her that she would go blind. Palmer told Nina she should not burden Cliff with a blind wife, so she broke off their engagement. Cliff, heart-broken by Nina breaking off their engagement, got drunk and was seduced by Sybil Thorne, a nurse who was jealous of Cliff and Nina's love. Nina began to spend time with Palmer's employee, Sean Cudahy. Sean and Nina were stuck in a bank robbery together. She passed out in a diabetic coma. Sean and Brooke English's efforts helped to stop the robbery and keep Nina alive. Nina also became friends with the new stable hand, Monique Jonvil. Nina learned that her eye condition was reversible with a non-invasive surgical technique. She traveled to Baltimore with her father to have the laser surgery done. When she returned to Pine Valley, she accepted Cliff's proposal. They married on the Cortland Manor grounds with horses and carriages. New friends Brooke and Monique were amongst her bridal party. But married bliss was not to be. Nurse Sybil Thorne revealed that when Cliff and Nina had broken up, she had gotten pregnant with his son. Nina moved back to Cortlandt Manor and filed for divorce from Cliff. Nina refused to see the man who had broken her heart. Nina still loved Cliff, but she knew they had no chance at happiness as long as Sybil held their unborn child as a bargaining chip. Monique convinced Nina to give Cliff another chance. Nina found herself falling back into his arms. They planned to announce their reconciliation at a dinner party in Cortlandt Manor. Sybil arrived to break up the party. After a heated argument with Nina, she went into labor. Cliff helped Sybil as she gave birth to Bobby Warner, their son. Nina watched from the sidelines as Sybil fumbled with life as single mother. She went to Sybil intent on offering to adopt her child and provide him the life she could not. Sybil threatened Nina, telling her if she did not leave Cliff she would give the child away to a stranger. When Cliff got word, he was enraged and stormed out to Sybil's apartment. That night, Sybil was found dead. Nina watched as Cliff fought for his innocence in court. But, things were looking very bleak. Then, a surprise witness entered the court: Monique. Monique implicated Sean in Sybil's murder. But, when the attorney asked her who she was, Monique made a startling revelation: she was Daisy Cortlandt, Nina's mother. Nina stood up in court and fainted in the center aisle upon hearing her mother was alive. In prison, Sean implicated Palmer as the mastermind of the entire plot. He was paying off both he and Sybil to keep Nina and Cliff apart. Nina rejected her father, and hoped to finally build a relationship with the mother he had exiled from her life. But, when Palmer went missing in Center City, Nina realized she could not cut her father out of her life forever. Palmer was found alive as an amnesiac. Nina hoped for his recovery. At the end of the year, Nina reconciled with Cliff, called off the divorce and they formally adopted Bobby. While her father was away on his honeymoon with the much younger Donna Beck, Nina got a frantic call from the Cortlandt Electronics Board of Directors. She used part of her trust fund to solve their fiscal problem. When Palmer returned he recognized his daughter's acumen for business and gave her an executive position in his company. Cliff did not want Nina working the long hours necessary for the job. He felt like she was beginning to neglect Bobby. Nina's coworker Steve Jacobi did not seem to understand that Nina was a married woman. At her Anniversary party, he planted a kiss on her. As much as Nina wanted to keep her relationship with Steve strictly business, things spiraled out of control. She began to fantasize about Steve while making love to Cliff. A storm hit Pine Valley while Steve and Nina were working at Cortlandt Manor. They were alone in the dark by the roaring fireplace. Nina succumbed to her innermost desires, sleeping with Steve. As much as she would want to forget her night of infidelity, she could not. They began an affair. Nina continued her torrid affair with Steve. Cliff went by his apartment one day to speak to Nina only to hear the lovers in a passionate embrace. Cliff filed for a quickie divorce. This time the divorce was finalized. Nina continued her life with Steve, but it was obvious his interest was waning. Nina wanted to talk marriage, while Steve was content with his life now. All the while, Nina and Cliff found themselves in many arguments over Bobby's welfare. This changed when Cliff believed that Nina had been killed in a helicopter crash. Cliff was ecstatic to learn Nina was alive. But, Cliff was now in a relationship with Devon Shepherd. Nina also knew she did not love Steve. She moved back in with her father at Cortlandt Manor. Devon stepped aside and left town. Eventually, Nna and Cliff reconciled and were married for the second time by a justice of the peace. Nina was mesmerized by the healing powers of a conman named Zach Grayson. Daisy tried to break Nina out of her trance. But, Nina's mental state weakened. Zach drugged and raped Nina, while Cliff's sister, Linda Warner, took photos. Zach planned to blackmail Nina with threats of showing Cliff the photos. Nina turned to her mother for help. Nina was shocked when Daisy was discovered in Zach's apartment, standing over his dead body with a bloody knife. In the duration of the trial, all of Zach's misdeeds came to light. The strain of the trial on her mother, and the end of any future with Cliff weighed heavily on Nina's psyche. Donna had served as a key witness for the duration of the trial. Nina began to displace all her aggression toward her father's former wife. Even after Donna exonerated Daisy for Zach's murder, Nina could not waive her intense feelings of hate towards her. At Donna's wedding to Benny Sago, Nina came with a gun. She tried to shoot Donna, but luckily missed. Nina finally broke from reality. She regressed to a state of adolescence, forgetting about her life as a mother and as Cliff's wife. It tore Palmer apart having to put his daughter in an asylum, but at least it kept her away from Cliff. Their second marriage ended in divorce. Nina tried to piece together her shattered life. She found solace in Benny's arms. But Benny was still very much married to Donna. Nina was convinced she was in love. Before things got out of hand, Daisy and Nina left on a long cruise. When Nina returned to Pine Valley, she began dating Matt Connolly. The couple ran into Cliff on Martha's Vineyard. Cliff's new fianc√©e, Dr. Amy Stone, was delayed in her arrival. Nina decided to keep Cliff company until Amy's train arrived. It was like no time had passed between the couple. When Nina saw Matt again, she knew their relationship was over. Waiting for her train to take her back to Pine Valley, Nina was plagued with thoughts of Cliff. But, she was not about to break up an engagement. At that very moment, she heard her name being called. Cliff was running on the platform, professing his love. Matt had told him that Nina still loved him. Nina got off the train as soon as she could, and the couple reunited. That Christmas, in front of family and friends, Nina and Cliff married for the third time at the Tavern on the Green in New York City. Nina anxiously awaited Cliff's return from a humanitarian mission in Hong Kong. But her world was turned upside down when news came that Cliff had gone to South America and was killed by rebels. Nina returned to Martha's Vineyard to mourne her husband. Matt followed her, afraid that she would have another break from reality. Nina wanted to be alone, but Matt refused to leave. In her moment of weakness, Nina and Matt shared a night of passionate lovemaking. As Nina lay next to Matt, she realized she did not want to be alone. She proposed to Matt and they married the next morning. Returning to Pine Valley, Nina got word that Cliff was alive. They had an emotional reunion where Cliff promised to never leave Nina again. Nina spent the night with Cliff. But, when Cliff learned about Nina's marriage to Matt, he rejected her. He wanted nothing to do with Nina anymore. She turned to Matt, hoping he would take her back. Nina found out she pregnant. She realized both Matt and Cliff could have been the child's father. Still recovering from Cliff's rejection, Nina told Matt the child was his. Matt got a new job in Chicago, and the Connolly's left Pine Valley. Because Cliff had been declared dead, Nina's marriage to him was dissolved. Nina returned to Pine Valley with a medical emergency. Her youngest son, Mikey Connolly, had fallen ill with a mysterious disease. She could not trust anyone else's diagnosis but Cliff's. Cliff was able to save Mikey, but in the process he uncovered something that Nina had feared all along: Mikey was Cliff's son, not Matt's. Upon learning the truth, Matt returned to Chicago without Nina. Nina and Cliff were drawn to each other again. Only, Cliff was now in a relationship with Angie Hubbard. When Nina admitted to Angie that she still loved Cliff, Angie stepped aside. Nina and Cliff married for the fourth and final time on the Cortlandt Manor grounds. The Warners then left for Denver to start their lives anew. =Trouble with Bobby, exit, and 2010 return= Nina arrived in Pine Valley for the Martin family housewarming. She had something important to talk about with her father, but decided to hold off after catching him in a heated argument with her mother. Nina sent Bobby to live with Palmer. He had grown up to be quiet the handful. Nina hoped that Palmer could instill the discipline that he was lacking. Upon learning that Bobby had impregnated Kesley Jefferson, Nina came back to Pine Valley. Palmer was ready to kick Bobby out of Cortlandt Manor. But Nina did not want Palmer to lose his relationship with his grandson because of one bad decision. Nina reminded Bobby how much she loved him, and that she would always support any decision he made. Nina returned in 2010 to mourn the death of her father, Palmer.

Filming began in Prescott, Arizona, in the fall of 1969, but the movie was not completed until 1971. Original filming location credits which were left out originally include: Plaza Santa Fe NM, Bandelier Indian Reservation NM, and Taos NM. American International Pictures pulled out, halting filming. 20th Century-Fox came forward and filming eventually resumed but when that studio refused to distribute the film, Warner Bros. stepped forward. Still, the film lacked distribution, so Laughlin booked it into theaters himself in 1971. The film grossed $10 million in its initial run, but eventually added close to $50 million in its re-release,\\"Revival of the fittest a Hollywood tradition\\", Leonard Klady, Variety, 11 November 1996, pg 75. with distribution supervised by Laughlin.  Plot  Billy Jack is a \\"half-breed\\" American Navajo, a Green Beret Vietnam War veteran, and a hapkido master. Jack defends the hippie-themed Freedom School (inspired by Prescott College) and students from townspeople who do not understand or like the counterculture students. The school is organized by its director Jean Roberts (Delores Taylor). A group of children of various races from the school go to town for ice cream and are refused service and then abused and humiliated by Bernard Posner (David Roya), the son of the county's corrupt political boss (Bert Freed), and his gang. This prompts a violent outburst by Billy. Later, Jean is raped by Bernard, who also murders a Native American student. Billy confronts Bernard, whom he catches in bed with a 13-year-old girl, and sustains a gunshot wound before killing him with a hand strike to the throat. After a climactic shootout with the police and pleading with Jean, Billy Jack surrenders to the authorities in exchange for a decade-long guarantee that the school will be allowed to continue to run with Jean as its head. As Billy is driven away in handcuffs, a large crowd of supporters raise their fists as a show of defiance and support.

In his Movie and Video Guide, film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, writing: \\"Seen today, its politics are highly questionable, and its 'message' of peace looks ridiculous, considering the amount of violence in the film.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and also saw the message of the film as self-contradictory, writing: \\"I'm also somewhat disturbed by the central theme of the movie. 'Billy Jack' seems to be saying the same thing as 'Born Losers,' that a gun is better than a constitution in the enforcement of justice.\\" Howard Thompson of The New York Times agreed, calling the film \\"well-aimed but misguided\\" as he wrote, \\"For a picture that preaches pacifism, 'Billy Jack' seems fascinated by its violence, of which it is full.\\" His review added that \\"some of the non-professional delivery of lines in the script by Mr. Frank and Teresa Christina is incredibly awful.\\" Variety opined that \\"the action frequently drags\\" and at nearly two hours' running length, \\"The message is rammed down the spectators' throats and is sorely in need of considerable editing to tell a straightforward story.\\" Gene Siskel gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, calling it \\"a film that tries to say too many things in too many ways within an adequate story line, but it has such freshness, original humor and compassion that one is frequently moved to genuine emotion.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 29, 1971). \\"Billy Jack\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 14. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times also liked the film, praising its \\"searing tension that sustains it through careening unevenness to a smash finish.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 10. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film as \\"horrendously self-righteous and devious,\\" explaining, \\"Every social issue is dramatized in terms of absolute, apolitical good and evil. The good guys ... are next to angelic, while the bad guys are, according to the needs of the moment, utter buffoons or utter devils. Anyone with the slightest trace of skepticism or sophistication would tend to reject the movie out of hand and with good reason, since this kind of simplification is dramatically and socially deceitful.\\" David Wilson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"If in the end Billy Jack is as much a sell-out as any glossier version of commercialised iconoclasm (Billy Jack is persuaded to accept guarantees which a hundred years of Indian history have repudiated), there is enough innocent sincerity in the film to demonstrate that Tom Laughlin at least has the courage of his convictions, even if those convictions are scarcely thought out.\\" Delores Taylor received a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcoming Actress. Tom Laughlin won the grand prize for the film at the 1971 Taormina International Film Festival in Italy.

It attained a cult following among younger audiences due to its youth-oriented, anti-authority message and the then-novel martial arts fight scenes which predate the Bruce Lee/kung fu movie trend that followed. The centerpiece of the film features Billy Jack, enraged over the mistreatment of his Native American friends, fighting racist thugs using hapkido techniques. In 2019, it was revealed that writer-director Quentin Tarantino and actor Brad Pitt used the film and Laughlin's performance as an influence while developing Pitt's character in Once Upon a Time in Hollywoodhttps://ew.com/movies/2019/07/03/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time- in-hollywood-inspiration-podcast/  References   External links  * Laughlin's official Billy Jack web site  Billy Jack at BLACK BELT TV The Martial Arts Network * The Man Who Made Billy Jack Go Berserk: A Conversation with David Roya‚ÄîInterview with Billy Jack co-star David \\"Bernard Posner\\" Roya * DVD review of the Billy Jack series and production history * A vision of American multiplicity, The Village Voice review, August 19, 1971 1971 films Fictional Navajo people Films about Native Americans Films shot in Arizona Films shot in California Films shot in New Mexico Hapkido films Hippie films Prescott, Arizona American vigilante films American films 1970s vigilante films Films directed by Tom Laughlin ","title":"Billy Jack"},{"id":"966555","text":"Map of The Maldives Mal√©, Capital of the Maldives This article shows a list of cities and towns in Maldives.

It is a portion of the old route of U.S. Highway 75 along the South Central Expressway, which now ends in downtown Dallas, in the southeastern part of Dallas that Interstate 45 and U.S. Highway 175 did not wholly supplant altogether. Route description Its northern terminus is US 175; its southern terminus is Interstate 45. The northern section is a freeway to Overton Road, just south of the Trinity River bridge, and a surface street from there to its southern terminus. The southbound bridge is the original simple steel girder bridge from abutment to abutment while the northbound is newer and largely precast concrete - the only steel girders are the longer spans directly over the river. The southbound bridge was repainted by CEKRA for TxDOT in late 2015. SH 310 north of Loop 12 (along with the northern portion of US 175 with which it connects) was co-named the S.M. Wright Freeway after a local minister. It is technically also referred to as Central Expressway, as the original US 75 was given this name. In practice, Dallasites refer to the current US 75 (the portion north of downtown) as Central Expressway and the decommissioned US 75 (the portion south of downtown) as the S.M. Wright Freeway. Through southern Dallas, Interstate 45 (also named the Julius Schepps Freeway) has replaced State Highway 310 as a through route. However, as I-45 is completely elevated between downtown and the Trinity River, during freezing rain events it is virtually impassable, whereupon it is closed and traffic is diverted onto State Highway 310. History An earlier SH 310 was designated on February 20, 1939 from SH 29 to the Lockhart Recreation Center. On September 26, 1939, SH 310 was cancelled and transferred to PR 10. The current SH 310 was designated on January 28, 1987, replacing part of US 75 from US 175 south to I-45. On April 29, 2013, SH 310 was extended north from US 175 to I-45, replacing part of US 175, which was designated to be rerouted on a more direct route west to I-45. The rerouting of US 175 is currently under construction.

In RAF slang, aircraftmen are sometimes called \\"erks\\". Aircraftman ranks below leading aircraftman and has a NATO rank code of OR-1. It is now a training rank only and no airmen in productive service hold this rank. Aircraftmen do not wear any rank insignia. History The rank was introduced to the RAF in January 1919, replacing the rank prefixes of \\"Air Mechanic\\", \\"Private\\" and \\"Clerk\\" that had been introduced under Air Memorandum No 1 in March 1918. There were three grades: leading aircraftman (LAC), aircraftman 1st class (AC1) and aircraftman 2nd class. A similar grading existed for junior ratings in the Royal Navy. The rank of senior aircraftman (SAC) was introduced on 1 January 1951. The lowest grade was an AC2; also colloquially known as an \\"AC plonk\\". With effect from 1 April 1964, the gradings of AC1 and AC2 were abolished, with \\"aircraftman\\" becoming the entry rank. Royal Canadian Air Force In the Royal Canadian Air Force, the rank is also known by the French term of aviateur. This was changed from private in spring 2015 when the RCAF changed the colour of its rank insignia from gold to pearl grey. It is the lowest rank in the RCAF.

T-VIS is intended to improve the low-end torque of high-performance, four- stroke internal combustion engines - by changing the geometry of the intake manifold according to the engine rotation speed. The system uses two separate intake runners per cylinder, one being equipped with a butterfly valve that can either open or close the runner. All valves are attached to a common shaft which is rotated by a vacuum actuator outside the manifold. T-VIS does not actually keep one of the intake valves from opening or seal off the port for one valve.Toyota Twin Cam, p. 11 The engine control unit (ECU) allows vacuum into the actuator by powering a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system is that in the lower engine speed band, the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine's power output may do so by increasing airflow per engine revolution, resulting in a high airflow at a lower rpm. In addition to providing more air at higher engine speeds, the system also creates a swirl in the combustion chamber at lower rpms. The swirl makes for more efficient combustion, and is due to the asymmetric nature of the airflow with one intake runner closed.

The most recent is the 2014 report. The reports were set up to inform the Montreal Protocol and amendments about ozone depletion.  Background  The Montreal and Vienna conventions were installed long before a scientific consensus was established.Technische Probleml√∂sung, Verhandeln und umfassende Probleml√∂sung, (eng. technical trouble shooting, negotiating and generic problem solving capability) in Gesellschaftliche Komplexit√§t und kollektive Handlungsf√§higkeit (Societys complexity and collective ability to act), ed. Schimank, U. (2000). Frankfurt/Main: Campus, p.154-182 book summary at the Max Planck Gesellschaft Until the 1980s, EU, NASA, NAS, UNEP, WMO and the British government had all issued further different scientific reports with dissenting conclusions. Sir Robert (Bob) Watson, Director of the Science Division of at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) played a crucial role in achieving unified reporting. The IPCC started from scratch with a more unified approach.  Findings  = Changes in Ozone-Depleting Compounds = * In the troposphere observations show that the total abundance of ozone-depleting compounds continues to decline slowly from the peak that occurred in 1992-1994. * Observations in the stratosphere indicate that the total chlorine abundance is at or near a peak, while bromine abundances are probably still increasing. * Analyses of air trapped in snow since the late 19th century have confirmed that non-industrial sources of the CFCs, halons, and major chlorocarbons were insignificant. The data suggest that substantial natural sources exist for atmospheric methyl bromide (CH3Br). * The abundances of HCFCs in the troposphere continue to increase. * water vapour is a greenhouse gas that has a greater overall effect on the ozone layer than carbon dioxide because of its higher concentrations but is not affected by human activities as it is caused mainly by evaporation and condensation rates. = Changes in the Ozone Layer over the Poles and Globally = * Springtime Antarctic ozone depletion due to halogens has been large (40-50%; exceptionally 70%) throughout the last decade. * In some recent cold Arctic winters during the last decade, maximum total column ozone losses due to halogens have reached 30%, but in warmer winters Arctic ozone loss is small. * Ozone remains depleted in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres. The global-average total column ozone amount for the period 1997-2001 was approximately 3% below the pre-1980 average values. * Models capture the observed long-term ozone changes in northern and southern midlatitudes. = Predictions = * Chemistry-climate models predict that springtime Antarctic ozone levels will be increasing by 2010 because of projected decreases of halogens in the stratosphere. A return to pre-1980 total column ozone amounts in the Antarctic is expected by the middle of this century. * Arctic ozone depletion is highly variable and difficult to predict, but a future Arctic polar ozone hole similar to that of the Antarctic appears unlikely. = Changes in Ultraviolet Radiation = * Decreases in ozone amounts lead to increases in UV radiation. Calculations of UV irradiance based on relationships with total ozone and total irradiance suggest that UV irradiance has increased since the early 1980s by 6-14% at more than 10 sites distributed over mid- and high latitudes of both hemispheres. But complexities (e.g. clouds, aerosol, snow cover, sea ice cover, and total ozone) limit the ability to describe fully surface ultraviolet radiation on the global scale. Surface ultraviolet data records, which started in the early 1990s, are still too short and too variable to permit the calculation of statistically significant long-term (i.e., multidecadal) trends. * However, estimates of surface UV radiation from satellite data (ozone and cloud cover) started in November 1978 with the launch of Nimbus-7/TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) followed by Meteor-3/TOMS in 1991, Earth-Probe/TOMS in 1996, and by OMI (Ozone Measuring Instrument on the EOS/AURA spacecraft) in July 2004. These time series are sufficient for estimates of multidecade trends in ozone, cloud cover, and UV irradiance (see ). The results clearly show that there have been significant increases in surface UVB at latitudes greater than about 40 degrees (northern US and Canada, most of Europe, Russia, and the southernmost portions of Argentina and Chile). The percent increase depends on the wavelength, with shorter wavelengths showing a larger percent increase. * Exposure to UV irradiance reaching the Earth's surface is also affected by the amount of cloud cover and by the altitude above sea level. These factors affect both UVA and UVB in nearly the same manner (less cloud cover or higher altitudes increase UV radiation at the Earth's surface). Some countries, such as Australia, have much less cloud cover than comparable sites in the Northern Hemisphere, and have much greater daily exposure to UV radiation. Australia, in particular, is known for health effects associated with UV exposure, and has a vigorous public health program to combat this problem. Satellite reflectivity data (TOMS) suggests that some populated regions (e.g., central Europe) have experienced small decreases in cloudiness, which would contribute to overall UV increases.

Al-Awda's name began appearing in Iraq in June 2003 in anti-occupation graffiti and leaflets in Baghdad and to the north and west of the capital. The group is led by Mohammed Younis al- Ahmed, who is based in Syria. Organization The organization was believed to be a network of underground cells, mainly in the key urban areas, composed of former Ba'ath Party officials, intelligence agents, former members of the Iraqi Republican Guard, and Fedayeen Saddam militia. The group was believed to rely on the pre-war organization of the Ba'ath Party and the relationships forged between various individuals and organizations within Saddam Hussein's regime. Propaganda and goals The group's propaganda indicated that its goal was to restore the regime of Saddam Hussein to power, as the name indicates, and expel multinational occupation forces from the country. Al-Awda is believed is to be the term coined by the insurgents for the Ba'ath Party following the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. The name was apparently chosen for propaganda reasons to raise the threat of the Ba'ath Party's return to power and to evoke the Palestinian struggle against Israel. In contrast to the JRTN, Ahmed has focused far more on securing political rehabilitation, amnesties and the repatriation of Baathist exiles than he has the violent overthrow of the Iraqi government and a Baathist return to power. Ahmed, in his attempts to reunite the party, and built a close working relationship with the Syrian government. Unlike al-Douri, who distrusts the Syrians due to their alliance with the Iranians. The Syrian government is quietly supporting Ahmed in order to gain more control over the Iraqi Ba'ath party. Ahmed's attempts to recruit support in Syria from former Iraqi Ba'athists is meeting some success, particularly among the poorer Sunni Arab segment of the refugee population, due in part to Ahmed's ability to offer cash incentives and Syrian residency permits due to their closeness to the Syrian government. The al-Awda group led by Ahmed is believed to contain most of the remaining leading party figures who were not arrested or executed, including Mezher Motni Awad, To'ma Di'aiyef Getan, Jabbar Haddoosh, Sajer Zubair, and Nihad alDulaimi. It could be said that al-Ahmed has returned to the Ba'ath Party's original ideology of secular pan-Arab nationalism which, in many cases, has proven successful in Iraq's Shi'a dominated southern provinces. However, despite his attempts, al-Ahmed has failed in his goal to overthrow al-Douri. Al-Douri's faction is the largest and the most active on the Internet, and the large majority of Ba'athist websites are aligned to al-Douri. Another failure is that al-Ahmed's faction, which is based in Syria, does not have exclusive Syrian support and, considering that it is based in Syria, the party is susceptible to Syrian interference in its affairs. However, despite the differences between the al- Douri and al-Ahmed factions, both of them adhere to Ba'athist thought. In contrast to al-Douri's group, al-Ahmad's faction has had success in recruiting Shi'as to the party. While al-Ahmed and the faction's senior leaders are Sunnis, there are many Shiites who are working in the organization's middle level. Upon his election as leader, an al-Douri faction statement said he was \\"of Shia origins and coming from Shia areas in Nineveh governorate\\". In contrast to al-Ahmed, al-Douri has stuck to a more conservative policy, recruiting members from a largely Sunni-dominated areas. =Saddam's death and party split: 2006‚Äì2011= The al-Awda party has schismed from the wider party, led by al-Douri. Following al-Douri's succession as the Regional Secretary of the Ba'ath Party, Younis al-Ahmed, called for a General Conference of the Iraqi Ba'ath party in Syria to elect a new leadership. This move caused a significant amount of controversy within the party, with al-Douri issuing a statement criticizing Syria for what al-Douri claimed was an American- supported attempt to undermine the Iraqi Ba'ath party, although this statement was later downplayed. The conference elected al-Ahmed as secretary-general, and al-Ahmed issued an order expelling al-Douri from the party, resulting in al-Douri issuing a counter order expelling al-Ahmed and 150 other party members. These events led to the existence, in effect, of two Iraqi Ba'ath Parties: the main party led by al-Douri, and the splinter al-Awda party led by al-Ahmed. =Attempts at reconciliation= According to leaked Wikileaks cables, in March 2009 several members of the former Ba'athist government claiming to represent the Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed led faction of the Ba'ath party approached Coalition Forces and the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Saladin Governorate. The figures met with representatives of the Coalition, instead of representatives of the Iraqi Government, because they claimed the Iraqi government was under Iranian influence, and might seek revenge against any Ba'ath Party members. The representatives claimed that the Younis-led faction were dissatisfied with the present government of Iraq, which they claimed was both sectarian and also failing to provide infrastructure and public services. The representatives claimed that the Younis led faction wasn't opposed to democracy, and instead wished to peacefully participate in the democratic process. They also claimed that unlike the al-Douri-led faction, they recognized that the pre-2003 Ba'athist government had made many mistakes, and that Iraq could not return to that system of government. =Government crackdowns= In December 2008 some 25 security officials were arrested for membership of Awda and attempting to restore the Ba'ath party, with some claiming they were planning a coup. The actual number of those involved may have reached 35, and included both Sunnis and Shiites and high ranking generals at the Interior Ministry, some of whom Awda had allegedly recruited through bribery. An Awda party senior official was arrested in a crackdown on the organisation in Baaquba, Diyala, on 2 July 2010. In October 2011 Iraqi security figures announced that they had detained 350 members of the Awda party, in a large operation across several provinces. The government claimed the group had been trying to reorganize the Ba'ath party, and work to undermine stability in the country, with a mind to seizing power following the US withdrawal the following year. The group appeared to be quite active in Nasiriyah, with 36 Ba'ath party leaders arrested there.

The elevated trains were noisy and often dirty (in the 19th century they were pulled by soot-spewing steam locomotives). This depressed land values along Second Avenue during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Partially because of the presence of the El, most buildings constructed during this era were working class tenements. The line was finally torn down in 1942 because it was deteriorated and obsolete, and the cost of World War II made upkeep impossible. Second Avenue maintains its modest architectural character today, despite running through a number of high income areas.

Rodzaevsky was also the chief editor of the RFP paper Nash Put. After the defeat of anti- communist forces in the Russian Civil War, he and his followers fled to Japanese-controlled China. He was lured by the NKVD to return to the Soviet Union with false promises of immunity and executed after a show trial in a Lubyanka prison cellar for \\"anti-soviet and counter-revolutionary activities\\". Far Eastern Fascism Born in Blagoveshchensk (across the Amur from China) in a family of the Siberian middle-class, he fled the Soviet Union for Manchuria in 1925. In Harbin, Rodzaevsky entered the law academy and joined the Russian Fascist Organization. On May 26, 1931, he became the Secretary General of the newly created Russian Fascist Party; in 1934 the Party amalgamated with the Russian Fascist Organization of Anastasy Vonsyatsky, Rodzaevsky becoming its leader. He modeled himself on Benito Mussolini, and also used the Swastika as one of the symbols of the movement. Rodzaevsky collected around himself personally selected bodyguards, and used symbolism of the former Russian Empire along with Russian nationalist symbols; like the Italian Blackshirts, the Russian Fascists wore black uniforms with black crossed belts; they were armed with weapons obtained from Japan's Imperial Japanese Army. They created an international organization of White √©migr√©s with a central office in Harbin, the \\"Russian Far East Moscow\\", and links in twenty-six nations around the world. The most important of these international posts was in New York City. Manchukuo Russian Club in Manzhouli. Rodzaevsky had around 12,000 followers in Manchukuo. During the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire of Japan, Rodzaevsky, with a select group of people, paid his respects to Emperor Hirohito at the official celebration in the region. The fascists installed a great swastika of neon light at their branch in Manzhouli (Manchouli), at least 3 km from the Soviet border. It was kept on all day and night to provide a show of power against the Soviet government. Rodzaevsky awaited the day when, leaving these signs on the Russian border, he would lead the White Anti-Soviet forces, joining White General Kislitsin and Japanese forces, into battle to \\"liberate the people of Russia from Soviet rule\\". Their main military acts involved the training of Asano Detachment, the all ethnic-Russian special forces in the Kwantung Army, organized for carrying out sabotage against Soviet forces in case of any Japanese invasion of Siberia and Russian Far East areas; Japan was apparently interested in creating a White Russian state in Outer Manchuria. World War II and execution During World War II, Rodzaevsky tried to launch an open struggle against Bolshevism, but Japanese authorities limited the RFP‚Äôs activities to acts of sabotage in the Soviet Union. A notorious anti-Semite, Rodzaevsky published numerous articles in the party newspapers Our way and The Nation; he was also the author of the brochure \\"Judas‚Äô End\\"Judas End and the book \\"Contemporary Judaisation of the World or the Jewish Question in the 20th Century\\".Contemporary Judaisation of the World or the Jewish Question in the 20th Century At the end of the war, perhaps as a desperate attempt to avoid execution in case that he would be captured by the advancing Red Army, Rodzaevsky began to state that the Soviet regime under Joseph Stalin was evolving into a nationalist one. He gave himself up to Soviet authorities in Harbin in 1945, with a letter that shows striking similarities with the doctrines of National Bolshevism: He returned to Russia, where he was promised freedom and a job in one of the Soviet newspapers. Instead, he was arrested (along with fellow party-member Lev Okhotin) and sentenced to death by show trial along with Grigory Semyonov, Vasilevsky Lev Fillipovich, Baksheev Aleksei Proklovich, Lev Okhotin, Ukhtomsky and others. He was executed in a Lubyanka prison cellar. In 2001, a book by Rodzaevsky, Zaveshchanie russkogo fashista (\\"The Last Will of a Russian fascist\\"), was published in Russia.

Never, not even like a hundred dollars or something. My real sense is that he (Bernard Stollman) was abducted by aliens, and when he was probed it erased his memory of where all the money was\\". The strongly anti-war themed Balaklava (1968) followed, inspired by the Charge of the Light Brigade. Rapp has said \\"The first two albums are probably considered the druggiest, and I had never done any drugs at that point. I smoked Winston cigarettes at that time, so these are all Winston-induced hallucinations.\\"Sleevenotes to Jewels Were The Stars box set The album covers featured paintings by Bosch and Brueghel, while the records themselves included interpretations of the writings of Tolkien and Herodotus as well as archive recordings from the 1890s, with innovatively arranged songs using an eclectic variety of instruments. Reprise period, 1969-72 The band signed for Reprise Records in 1969, although by this time the other original members had left and the band name now referred to Rapp and whichever musicians he was recording or touring with, one of whom, Jim Fairs, was previously a member of The Cryan' Shames. The five albums on Reprise were generally more conventional in sound, but contained a unique blend of humanistic and mystical songs, with some whimsical touches. Some were recorded in New York and others ‚Äì particularly The Use of Ashes and City of Gold - in Nashville with top session musicians including Charlie McCoy, Kenny Buttrey, and other members of Area Code 615. Several also featured Rapp's then-wife Elisabeth on vocals. The oddly-upbeat \\"The Man\\", from City of Gold, was sung by David Noyes and recorded at A&R; Studios in New York City during the summer of 1970. Noyes' friend, Jon Tooker, took his position when the band toured Europe that fall. In his teens, Rapp lived close to Cape Canaveral and watched the rockets take off. The song \\"Rocket Man\\", on the album The Use of Ashes - written the day Neil Armstrong landed on the moon - was credited by Bernie Taupin with inspiring his hit song with Elton John of the same title. Quote : \\"We didn't steal that one from Bowie, we stole it from another guy, called Tom Rapp...\\". Many of the other songs of this period reflected Rapp's interests in mysticism, his relationship with his alcoholic father, and his experiences of living for a time in (and marrying a native of) the Netherlands. \\"Rocket Man\\" was based on a story by Ray Bradbury. In 1971, Pearls Before Swine toured for the first time, the group then comprising Rapp, Mike Krawitz (piano), Gordon Hayes (bass) and Jon Tooker (guitar). Around this time, Rapp often referred onstage, not quite seriously, to the group as \\"the house band for the SDS.\\" A live album from this period, Live Pearls, recorded at Yale University, was released as a download in December 2008.Official PBS site The final Reprise album, Familiar Songs, consisted of newly conceived, arranged, and produced recordings of some of Rapp's earlier songs, along with a few new and unreleased, featuring his then-current band, Morrie Brown (bass, guitar, mandolin and vocals), Robby Merkin (piano, organ, synth, bass and vocals), and David Wolfert (acoustic and electric guitar, 12-string, Dobro and vocals) along with drummer Billy Mundi, formerly of The Mothers Of Invention. Without Rapp's knowledge, the label released it not as a \\"Pearls Before Swine\\" album, but under his name alone.Sleevenotes to Familiar Songs CD reissue Later years Two further albums followed, released under Rapp's own name on Blue Thumb Records. The first, Stardancer, was again recorded in Nashville, followed by Sunforest. The band - by that time comprising Rapp, Art Ellis (flute), Bill Rollins (bass, cello) and Harry Orlove (guitar, banjo) - toured until 1974, with Rapp from then performing solo until a final appearance in 1976 supporting Patti Smith. After this, Rapp retired from music and, after graduating from Brandeis University, became a civil rights lawyer. After being contacted by the magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope, he re-appeared in 1997 at Terrastock, a music festival in Providence, Rhode Island, with his son's band, Shy Camp, and began recording again with 1999's A Journal of the Plague Year. Tom Rapp appears on the Neil Young 2CD tribute This Note's For You Too with the song \\"After the Gold Rush\\" on Inbetweens Records. Original member Roger Crissinger left the group in 1968, joining San Francisco band One (1) led by Reality D. Blipcrotch.The Hangar Lane Lederer is now a member of the Florida Orchestra. Bass guitarist Morrie Brown became a record producer in R&B; music. He was responsible for mentoring up and coming songwriters and producers Paul Laurence and Kashif. Brown collaborated with Kashif and Laurence on creating hit singles for B.T. Express and Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King - the latter of which Brown produced her biggest hits \\"I'm in Love\\", \\"Love Come Down\\" and \\"Betcha She Don't Love You\\" - as well as Howard Johnson's 1982 hit \\"So Fine\\". Since 1992, Brown has been the owner and founder of the printing software company PrintPoint. Guitarist David Wolfert also became a record producer, as well as session musician. Wolfert worked on albums by Barbra Streisand, Don Covay, and the Four Tops, where he would produce the song \\"I Believe in You and Me\\" which would later be covered by Whitney Houston. Wolfert also produced the solo debut Out of Control for Kiss drummer Peter Criss. In recent years, Wolfert composed the music for the English language version of the anime, Pok√©mon.

The two married on 8 June 1869. From the late 1870s, Wilfrid and Lady Anne travelled extensively in Arabia and the Middle East, buying Arabian horses from Bedouin tribesmen and the Egyptian Ali Pasha Sherif. Among the great and influential horses they took to England were Azrek, Dajania, Queen of Sheba, Rodania and the famous Ali Pasha Sherif stallion Mesaoud. To this day, the vast majority of purebred Arabian horses trace their lineage to at least one Crabbet ancestor. Life and work Lady Anne was a daughter of William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace, and Hon. Augusta Ada Byron, the world's first computer programmer. Her maternal grandparents were the poet Lord Byron and Annabella Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth. In childhood, she was known as \\"Annabella,\\" after the grandmother for whom she was named. A watercolour by Blunt described as \\"'Window onto an (?)Italian lake'. Dated ‚ÄòNov.26 / (18)67‚Äô. Inscribed verso of backing and dated 1868. 15x11 inches.\\" Lady Anne was fluent in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Arabic, a skilled violinist and a gifted artist who studied drawing with John Ruskin. She also had a lifelong love of horses, dating from childhood, and was an accomplished equestrienne.Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. The Authentic Arabian Horse, 3rd ed. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1979 Her interest in the Arabian horse, combined with Wilfrid's interest in Middle Eastern politics, led to their mutual interest in saving the Arabian breed and thus their many journeys. Lady Anne travelled extensively in the Middle East, and is particularly noted as the first European woman to ride through the Arabian desert to reach the city of Ha'il. The books Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates and A Pilgrimage to Nejd are attributed to her and were based on her journals, but were extensively edited by her husband. Her own voice comes through more clearly in her published journals.Archer, Rosemary and James Fleming, ed. Lady Anne Blunt: Journals and Correspondence 1878‚Äì1917, publ. 1986 She owned a violin made by Stradivarius, since known as the Lady Blunt Stradivarius, though she was not the original owner.Simeon Bennett, \\"Stradivarius at $15.9 Million Means Investors Bet on Violins\\", Bloomberg, 22 June 2011. It was extensively refurbished in 1864 by Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, from whom she purchased the instrument upon recommendation of her instructor, Leopold Jansahttp://tarisio.com/cozio- archive/cozio-carteggio/the-lady-blunt-stradivarius-violin-cremona-1721/ and she possessed the instrument for 30 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-13852872 selling it in 1895. Lady Anne's 1869 marriage to Blunt was not a happy one. Her many pregnancies produced a single surviving child, Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth. Anne never ceased to grieve over her miscarriages and the babies who died soon after birth. Although a fond father to Judith when she was a child, Blunt made no secret that he would have preferred a son. Lady Anne and Wilfrid differed over management of their horses, with Wilfrid, though the less talented horseman, often prevailing on management decisions. At times, this meant leaving valuable bloodstock in Egypt under the care of inept managers who neglected the horses to the point that some died of exposure and thirst. In England, his theory that Arabian horses should live under \\"desert conditions\\", even in a cold, damp climate, often meant the animals lived with insufficient fodder and were exposed to the elements to an unnecessary degree. Blunt also had many mistresses, often simultaneously. However, in 1906, when his mistress Dorothy Carleton (later adopted as his niece) moved into their home, Lady Anne, unable to tolerate what she termed an \\"oriental\\" lifestyle, left him. The Blunts agreed to a formal separation and the Stud was divided. Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid. Under its terms, Lady Anne kept Crabbet Park and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Following the separation, Lady Anne spent several months each year at her Sheykh Obeyd estate near Cairo, a 32-acre (129,000 m2) apricot orchard the Blunts had purchased in 1882 and set up as a breeding farm for the horses they owned in Egypt. Her daughter Judith lived full-time at the Crabbet estate with her own husband and children. Finally, leaving the stud under the management of Judith, Lady Anne left England permanently in October 1915 and spent the remaining years of her life at Sheykh Obeyd. Legacy Shortly before her own death in 1917, Lady Anne inherited the Wentworth title after her niece, Ada King-Milbanke, 14th Baroness Wentworth died childless. Wilfrid, always short of money, made a number of attempts to get Lady Anne to sign control or ownership of her portion of Crabbet to him, going so far at one point as to alienate Judith and her mother to the point that Lady Anne disinherited Judith (though she wisely chose not to favour Wilfred). Following Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Wentworth title passed to Judith, who by that time owned some horses and property in her own right, and Lady Anne bequeathed her remaining portion of Crabbet to Judith's daughters, appointing a trustee to oversee the estate. Wilfrid and Judith disputed Lady Anne's estate and the ownership of many horses. The bitter battle went to court, where a verdict in favour of Judith's children was rendered in 1920, invalidating the deed of partition and reunifying most of the stud. Wilfrid died in 1922, having verbally reconciled with Judith but without rewriting his will to grant her any inheritance of his remaining property. Over time Judith had managed to buy out her daughters' shares of Crabbet and Newbuidings from the trustee, buy back many of the horses Wilfrid had sold to third parties, and the Crabbet stud continued under Judith's management. Under Judith, her management and breeding decisions improved upon the \\"desert conditions\\" theories of Wilfrid. Her addition of non-desertbred Arabian stock, such as the Polish-bred Arabian stallion Skowronek, created controversy, but the stud survived and prospered for almost fifty years until 1971, when the property itself was bisected by a motorway. Judith sold Crabbet horses all over the world, including to the United States, Australia, Spain and Russia. She sold some horses bred from the Blunt lines back to Egypt, where they have a legacy today. Modern studs known for Crabbet breeding, including Al-Marah in America and Fenwick in Australia, which both owe their existence to large-scale importations of horses bred at Crabbet. Today, due to the worldwide dispersal of Crabbet stock over its near-century of existence, most modern Arabian horses contain lines to Crabbet breeding, regardless of their nation of birth. Over 90% of all Arabians registered in the United States, for example, contain one or more lines to the Crabbet Park Stud. Arabian Horse Association website; accessed 27 March 2014. Some \\"Crabbet\\" breeders consider themselves preservationists, maintaining a small pool of pure or high-percentage Crabbet horses, while others use these lines as an outcross on other strains. In either situation, Crabbet-bred Arabian horses have a reputation for athleticism and classic type, good temperament, performance ability and soundness. The Lady Blunt Stradivarius is now considered one of the best-preserved Stradivarius violins in the world. It was sold at auction in Japan in 2011 for a world record high of ¬£9.8 million (US$15.9 million). It has previously sold for ¬£84,500 (US$200,000), also a record at the time, in 1971.

First appearing in the works of cartoonist Charles Addams, she is a supporting character in series film, television and stage adaptations. Character background Grandmama Addams is an aged witch who concocts potions and spells, and dabbles in fortune telling and knife throwing. She is the grandmother of the Addams children, Pugsley and Wednesday, although her relationship to the other family members is less consistent. Grandmama first appeared along with the then-unnamed Addams family in Charles Addams' original cartoons published in The New Yorker, in which she was regularly illustrated with shoulder-length frizzy hair and a fringed shawl. Addams described Grandmama in a 1963 character synopsis as \\"a disrespectful old hag\\" and \\"foolishly good-natured ... a weak character [who] is easily led.\\" In Charles Addams' original The New Yorker cartoon strips, the character was referred to as Grandma Frump,Miserocchi, Kevin, (2010) The Addams Family: An Evilution, p.2 (online sample pages) therefore making her Morticia's mother. For the original television series ‚Äî as well as The New Addams Family, in which she is named Eudora Addams ‚Äî her relationship to the family is retconned and she becomes Gomez‚Äôs mother. However, both the feature films and animated television series conform to Charles Addams' original concept of Grandmama as Wednesday's and Pugsley's maternal grandmother. In the first film, Morticia and Fester discuss how \\"Mother and Father Addams\\" were killed by an angry mob, removing any possibility that Grandmama could be Gomez and Fester's mother. In the third film, in which she is named Esmeralda, she is again implied to come from Morticia's family. The character is simply referred to as Granny in the two animated series. In the 1992 series, Grandmama is of Morticia's family, when she introduces herself with the line \\"the name's Granny Frump\\".Episode 1x02, \\"Dead and Breakfast\\", (1992) The Addams Family In the Broadway musical The Addams Family, Morticia refers to Grandmama as Gomez and Uncle Fester's mother, to which Gomez reacts with surprise and says that he thought she was Morticia's mother; Morticia later says that Grandmama \\"may not even be part of this family\\". In the animated film, she is Gomez and Fester's mother. Appearances =Television and film= The character was named \\"Grandmama\\" for the 1960s television series in order to avoid confusion with Granny from The Beverly Hillbillies. She was played by Blossom Rock, who won the role over actresses such as Minerva Urecal and Marjorie Bennett,Image gallery from Time magazine; reposted on tumblr.com while Alice Pearce had been rejected after the producers deemed her too young for the part. She is depicted as being good friends with Morticia's mother Granny Frump (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton). Due to illness, Rock was the one regular cast member from the show who did not return for the 1977 reunion film Halloween with the New Addams Family, and she was replaced as Grandmama by Jane Rose. The character was played by Betty Phillips in the 1998-99 television series The New Addams Family. Janet Waldo voiced Grandmama in the 1973 animated series, and Carol Channing provided the character's voice for the 1992 animated series. Bette Midler voiced the character in the 2019 computer-animated film. She is shown to be Gomez's and Fester's mother, with Morticia's parents having died years ago. Grandmama is also revealed to have a dwarfish sister named Sloom (voiced by Jenifer Lewis) who oversees Pugsley's Mazurka. Three different actresses played Grandmama in the three Addams Family feature films. Judith Malina appeared in the 1991 film The Addams Family, and was replaced by Carol Kane for the 1993 sequel Addams Family Values. For the 1998 direct-to-video picture Addams Family Reunion, Grandmama was played by Alice Ghostley. =In other media= In the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System game Fester's Quest, the instruction booklet says Grandmama's psychic powers foretold the alien invasion that would come and abduct all the people in the city, so she invokes a curse on the family mansion. As a result, when extraterrestrial scouts scan the Addams residence for life forms they find none, thanks to Grandmama's curse. Grandmama was played by Jackie Hoffman in the 2010 Broadway musical, in which her relation to the family in the storyline is ambiguous. In Act Two, Morticia tells Gomez that \\"[his] mother came to our home and now she's here forever\\" to which he replies \\"wait, I thought she was your mother\\", referencing Grandmama's ever changing relation to the family in the franchise.

A combination print made from six different negatives. Combination printing is the photographic technique of using the negatives of two or more images in conjunction with one another to create a single image. Similar to dual-negative landscape photography, combination printing was technically much more complex. The concept of combination printing stemmed from the desire to create more of a fine art within photography and often more idealized images.Davenport, Alma. The History of Photography: An Overview. Boston: Focal, 1991. Print. Combination printing was popular in the mid-19th century due to the limitations of the negative's light sensitivity and camera technology. For example, the long exposures required at the time to create an image would properly expose the main subject, such as a building, but would completely overexpose the sky. The sky would then lack detail, usually appearing as solid white. Hippolyte Bayard, a French photographer, was the first to suggest combining two separate negatives, one of the subject matter and one of a properly exposed negative of clouds, to create a balanced photograph. The technique was also used to create new, original compositions and provided new ways for photographers to be more creative with their work. Later on, the technique paved the way for yet another artistic process, photomontage.  Process  In combination printing, you use two or more negatives to make one good print.Kodak - Basic Dark Room Techniques: Combination Printing Combination printing required a lot of careful work to plan out the concept of what the final image was desired to look like. It was also a task of great skill and patience. When a photographer wished to create a combination print, issues of good exposures, scaling the subjects to match up, and consistent lighting were all essentials if they aimed to make it look as realistic as possible.Hannavy, John. Encyclopedia of Nineteenth Century Photography. Vol. 1. London: Routledge, 2008. Print. For instance, in the example of combining a foreground subject with adding clouds to a sky, it is important to make sure that the direction of the light falling on the clouds is the same as the light used on the main subject in the original foreground negative.Kodak - Basic Dark Room Techniques: Combination Printing In actually exposing the negatives to combine them, the photographer must control the exposure of the portion of the initial photo that they will be adding to or replacing. Therefore, for adding clouds into the sky, the photographer would have to hold back light from the sky area and expose the foreground area.Kodak - Basic Dark Room Techniques: Combination Printing Then, when printing the negative of the clouds, do the opposite and only expose the cloud and sky portion of the photo. After this, they would be able to combine the two negatives by blending them together. History Photographers such as William Frederick Lake Price and Oscar Rejlander are famous for using combination printing. Starting as early as the mid-19th century, new methods such as the combination printing, began to change the way people looked at different photographic techniques. Controversy broke out in the photographic community about the use of combination printing. Photographs originally had been regarded as truth and it was perceived that the camera never lied. However, with the newfound ability to manipulate the final product, the notion that photographs depicted \\"truth\\" was soon shattered. Henry Peach Robinson, considered to be another one of the pioneers of combination printing,Robinson, H. P. (1860). On Printing Photographic Pictures from Several Negatives. British Journal of Photography, 7(115), 94. was not only an artist, but also an author, and wrote many journal articles on photography. He then published a book in 1869 entitled Pictorial Effect in Photography. His writings about technique became fairly well known and he was held in high esteem, despite having critics who accused him of misrepresenting the real world and the truth by using the combination printing method.Hannavy, John. Encyclopedia of Nineteenth Century Photography. Vol. 1. London: Routledge, 2008. Print. In his book, Robinson attempts to add some reasoning to appease the critics, by comparing the photograph editing to other art forms and writing that, \\"As music is only sound under governance of certain laws, so is pictorial effect only the combination of certain forms and lights and shadows in like manner harmoniously brought together.\\"Robinson, Henry Peach. Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints on Composition and Chiaro-oscuro for Photographers. Philadelphia: E.L. Wilson, 1881. Print. He agrees about the argument of staying true to nature in photographs, but alternatively writes that when a photographer obtains a foreground subject, they need the perfect background to create the \\"harmony\\" of a good photo, and \\"if nature does not supply such object, the pictorial requirement may often, without violating material truth, be furnished by art.\\"Robinson, Henry Peach. Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints on Composition and Chiaro-oscuro for Photographers. Philadelphia: E.L. Wilson, 1881. Print. In pointing this out, he is saying that it is often necessary to add artistic techniques to photographs. Discussing the benefits of composition in the art of photography and using combination printing, Robinson wrote, in Pictorial Effect in Photography, that the method of combination served to \\"produce an agreeable presentation of forms and tones, to tell the story which is to be elucidated, and to embody the spirit of what it is intended the picture shall represent or suggest.\\"Robinson, Henry Peach. Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints on Composition and Chiaro-oscuro for Photographers. Philadelphia: E.L. Wilson, 1881. Print. His writings show his knowledge and his passion for creating new content in his photos with using this process. During the Victorian Era, another proponent of the technique of combination printing was Queen Victoria herself. At the time, artists tried to represent ideal images from natural scenes to portraits. Photographers wished to do the same through creating perfected images after combining them. Queen Victoria was said to have belief in the power that photography could have to visually translate and promote ideals yet still be reality.Davenport, Alma. The History of Photography: An Overview. Boston: Focal, 1991. Print.  Early examples Oscar Gustave Rejlander's Two Ways of Life, 1857 One of the earliest and most famous combination prints is Oscar Rejlander's Two Ways of Life. The print was created in 1857. It was first exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition and it is considered one of the most distinguished examples of the technique. It used a combination of 32 negatives to create the complete image of the final product. The process took about six weeks.Lima, Marcelo Guimaraes, PhD. \\"Oscar Rejlander - The Two Ways of Life.\\" Web log post. Introduction to the History of Photography. N.p., 9 Feb. 2012. Web. . Other examples of the technique can be seen in Henry Peach Robinson's works. In one of his pieces, entitled Autumn there is a darker foreground subject with some hazy distance created with trees visible in the far background. The piece includes several human subjects, some facing the camera with light hitting them, and one darker and facing away from view. Henry Peach Robinson's Autumn, 1860 This was an albumen print photo that he put together in 1863. When explaining the print, Robinson discussed that he initially sketched out the scene that he hoped to produce, trying different various samples of what he could do with putting the scenery and figures together. Only after he was happy with his sketched out plan would he finally shoot the individual photos and then eventually combine the negatives in printing. Henry Peach Robinson's Fading Away, 1858 Sometimes called Robinson's \\"masterpiece,\\" his photograph, Fading Away, was a combination print that he generated in 1858. It took him around five negatives to create the final image. The photo shows a death of a young girl and her grieving family surrounding her. The subject was made up by Robinson and the figures were only posing, but the scene with the girl being centered and bright and the figure turned away, behind in the darkness, created an emotional exhibit.  Modern applications In more modern times of photography, there exists a theory, presented by Jerry Uelsmann in 1965 to The Society for Photographic Education, called Post-Visualization, that can be connected back to the creation of combination printing.Uelsmann, Jerry. Uelsmann: Process and Perception. Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 1985. Post-Visualization was the idea that photographers can rethink what they are creating and manipulate images in the darkroom after photographing their subjects. This allows photographers additional ways to express themselves instead of just following the common belief that photography is a simply mechanical, straightforward process with no creative elements.Harding, Kerri. \\"Post-Visualization and Combination Printing: The Influence of Photographic Process on Contemporary Photography.\\" Ed. Catherine Pagani, Ph.D. The University of Alabama McNair Journal (2008): 63-84. Web. . Combination printing remained a great way of working with changing images to add that creativity.

Early life Crawford was born in Bagni di Lucca, Grand Duchy of Tuscany on August 2, 1854. He was the only son of the American sculptor Thomas Crawford and Louisa Cutler Ward. His sister was the writer Mary Crawford Fraser (aka Mrs. Hugh Fraser), and he was the nephew of Julia Ward Howe, the American poet. After his father's death in 1857, his mother remarried to Luther Terry, with whom she had Crawford's half-sister, Margaret Ward Terry, who later became the wife of Winthrop Astor Chanler. He studied successively at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire; Cambridge University; University of Heidelberg; and the University of Rome. In 1879, he went to India, where he studied Sanskrit and edited in Allahabad The Indian Herald. Returning to America in February 1881, he continued to study Sanskrit at Harvard University for a year and for two years contributed to various periodicals, mainly The Critic. Early in 1882, he established his lifelong close friendship with Isabella Stewart Gardner. During this period he lived most of the time in Boston at his Aunt Julia Ward Howe's house and in the company of his Uncle, Sam Ward. His family was concerned about his financial prospects. His mother had hoped he could train in Boston for a career as an operatic baritone based on his private renditions of Schubert lieder. In January 1882, George Henschel, conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, assess his prospects and determined Crawford would \\"never be able to sing in perfect tune\\". His Uncle Sam Ward suggested he try writing about his years in India and helped him develop contacts with New York publishers. Career In December 1882, he produced his first novel, Mr Isaacs, a sketch of modern Anglo-Indian life mingled with a touch of Oriental mystery. It had an immediate success, and Dr Claudius (1883) followed promptly. In May 1883, he returned to Italy, where he made his permanent home. He lived at the historic Hotel Cocumella in Sorrento during 1885 and settled permanently in Sant'Agnello, where in the fall he bought the Villa Renzi that became Villa Crawford. More than half his novels are set in Italy. He wrote three long historical studies of Italy and was well advanced with a history of Rome in the Middle Ages when he died. This may explain why Marion Crawford's books stand apart from any distinctively American current in literature. Francis Marion Crawford Year by year Crawford published a number of successful novels. However his 1896 novel Adam Johnstone's Son was thought by the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing to be \\"rubbish\\".Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.423. Late in the 1890s, Crawford began to write his historical works. These are: Ave Roma Immortalis (1898), Rulers of the South (1900) renamed Southern Italy and Sicily and The Rulers of the South in 1905 for the American market, and Gleanings from Venetian History (1905) with the American title Salvae Venetia, reissued in 1909 as Venice; the Place and the People. In these, his intimate knowledge of local Italian history combines with the romanticist's imaginative faculty to excellent effect. His shorter book Constantinople (1895) belongs to this category. After most of his fictional works had been published, most came to think he was a gifted narrator; and his books of fiction, full of historic vitality and dramatic characterization, became widely popular among readers to whom the realism of problems or the eccentricities of subjective analysis were repellent. In The Novel: What It Is (1893), he defended his literary approach, self-conceived as a combination of romanticism and realism, defining the art form in terms of its marketplace and audience. The novel, he wrote, is \\"a marketable commodity\\" and \\"intellectual artistic luxury\\" (8, 9) that \\"must amuse, indeed, but should amuse reasonably, from an intellectual point of view. . . . Its intention is to amuse and please, and certainly not to teach and preach; but in order to amuse well it must be a finely-balanced creation. . . .\\" (82). The Saracinesca series is perhaps known to be his best work, with the third in the series, Don Orsino (1892) set against the background of a real estate bubble, told with effective concision. The second volume is Sant' Ilario [Hilary] (1889). A fourth book in the series, Corleone (1897), was the first major treatment of the Mafia in literature, and used the now-familiar but then-original device of a priest unable to testify to a crime because of the Seal of the Confessional; the novel is not one of his major works, having failed to live up to the standard set by the books earlier in the series. Crawford ended Rulers of the South (1900) with a chapter about the Sicilian Mafia. Crawford himself was fondest of Khaled: A Tale of Arabia (1891), a story of a genie (genius is Crawford's word) who becomes human, which was reprinted (1971) in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series of the early 1970s. A Cigarette-Maker's Romance (1890) was dramatized, and had considerable popularity on the stage as well as in its novel form; and in 1902 an original play from his pen, Francesca da Rimini, was produced in Paris by his friend Sarah Bernhardt. Crawford's best known dramatization was that of The White Sister (1909). Its main actress was Viola Allen, whose first film was the 1915 film of this novel; it was filmed again in 1923 and 1933. In the Palace of the King (1900) was filmed in 1915 and 1923; Mr. Isaacs (1882) was filmed in 1931 as Son of India. Several of his short stories, such as \\"The Upper Berth\\" (1886; written in 1885), \\"For the Blood Is the Life\\" (1905, a vampiress tale), \\"The Dead Smile\\" (1899), and \\"The Screaming Skull\\" (1908), are often- anthologized classics of the horror genre. An essay on Crawford's weird tales can be found in S. T. Joshi's The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004); there are many other essays and introductions. The collected weird stories were posthumously published in 1911 as Wandering Ghosts in the U.S. and as Uncanny Tales in the UK, both without the long-forgotten \\"The King's Messenger\\" (1907). The present definitive edition is that edited by Richard Dalby as Uncanny Tales and published by the Tartarus Press (1997; 2008). Crawford's novella Man Overboard! (1903) is often overlooked, but belongs with his supernatural works. In 1901, the American Macmillan firm began a deluxe uniform edition of his novels, as reprintings required. In 1904 the P. F. Collier Co. (N. Y.) was authorized to publish a 25-volume edition, later increased to 32 volumes. Around 1914 the subscription firm McKinlay, Stone, Mackenzie was authorized to publish an edition using the Macmillan binding decorations. In 1919 the American Macmillan firm published the \\"Sorrento Edition\\". They also had issued some first American editions and reprints in a uniform binding from 1891 through 1899. The British Macmillan firm used two separate uniform bindings from 1889 until after 1910. Crawford wrote numerous articles for major periodicals and a few contributions to books. See the section \\"Bibliographical History\\" in An F. Marion Crawford Companion (1981) by John C. Moran. Personal life In 1880, Crawford converted to Roman Catholicism. \\"After converting to Catholicism in 1880, at the age of twenty‚Äîsix, Crawford wrote dozens of books in which Catholic religion is prominent but not evangelically presented, frequently using his native Italy as the setting for his stories.\\" James Emmett Ryan, Faithful Passages: American Catholicism in Literary Culture, 1844‚Äì1931. University of Wisconsin Press, 2013 (p.166). In October 1884 he married Elizabeth Berdan, the daughter of the American Civil War Union General Hiram Berdan. They had two sons and two daughters, Eleanor, Harold, Clara and Bertram. Crawford died at Sorrento on Good Friday 1909 at Villa Crawford of a heart attack. It was the result of a severe lung injury ten years previous, caused by inhalation of toxic gases at a glass-smelting works in Colorado, which happened during his American lecture tour in the winter of 1897‚Äì1898. He was gathering technical information for his historical novel Marietta (1901), that describes glass- making in late medieval Venice. After his death, his widow sued for breach of contract related to the production of Crawford's novels into a film. =Legacy and influence= In his 1929 article \\"Some Remarks on Ghost Stories\\" M. R. James praised Crawford's supernatural fiction. James stated that \\"Marion Crawford and his horrid story of \\"The Upper Berth\\", which (with \\"The Screaming Skull\\" some distance behind) is the best in his collection of Uncanny Tales, and stands high among ghost stories in general.\\" James, M. R. \\"Some Remarks on Ghost Stories\\", in The Bookman, December 1929. Reprinted in James, Collected Ghost Stories, edited by Darryl Jones. Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2011. p. 415\\\\. H.

Russell Wakefield, \\"Why I Write Ghost Stories\\", in Stories From The Clock Strikes Twelve, New York : Ballantine Books, 1961. (p. 7) Norman Douglas credits Crawford's financial success as instrumental in encouraging himself to write (though he remained critical of Crawford's habit of inserting first-person editorial comments into his fiction).Norman Douglas, Looking Back (Chatto and Windus, 1934) p. 496-8 The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society was founded in 1975 and published the literary review The Romantist from 1977 until 1997. In 1997 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford was founded at Sant'Agnello di Sorrento. It is formally associated with the FMC Memorial Society and continues The Romantist in its annual review Genius Loci (1997‚Äì). In early May 1988 at Sant'Agnello, a Conference was held to commemorate Crawford. It was organized by the Comune di Sant' Agnello di Sorrento and the Istituto Universitario Orientale (Naples). Its \\"Acta\\" were published in English and Italian as Il Magnifico Crawford. Scrittore per Mestiere / The Magnificent Crawford. Writer by Trade (1990), edited by Gordon Poole. In mid- May 2009 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford and the Comune di Sant' Agnello organized another Conference ‚Äì Francis Marion Crawford; 100 Anni Dopo ‚Äì to remember Crawford on the centenary of his death. Its \\"Acta\\" were published in Italian and English as Nuova Luce Su Francis Marion Crawford. Cento Anni Dopo 2009-1909 / A Hundred Years Later: New Light on Francis Marion Crawford early in 2011, edited by Gordon Poole. The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society collaborated in the organization of both Conferences. There is a major street in the Italian town of Sant'Agnello di Sorrento (the town where he died) named after him, the Corso Marion Crawford. There is a historical marker on the house where Crawford was born, in Bagni di Lucca. Villa Crawford was donated many years ago by Crawford's daughters Lady Eleanor Rocca-Crawford and Mother Clare Marion-Crawford to the Salesian Sisters, who operate it today as a high school for girls.

It stands on a hill in the neck of the meander of the River Severn on which the town originally developed. The castle, directly above Shrewsbury railway station, is a Grade I listed building. History Shrewsbury Castle, c.1778 Shrewsbury Castle viewed from Laura's Tower A castle was ordered on the site by William I c. 1067 - a very early date - but it was greatly extended under Roger de Montgomery circa 1070 as a base for operations into Wales, an administrative centre and as a defensive fortification for the town, which was otherwise protected by the loop of the river. Town walls, of which little now remains, were later added to the defences, as a response to Welsh raids and radiated out from the castle and surrounded the town; the area known as Town Walls still has a small section of them and a single tower, known as Town Walls Tower, which is in the care of the National Trust). In 1138, King Stephen successfully besieged the castle held by William FitzAlan for the Empress Maud during the period known as The Anarchy. The castle was briefly held by Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales, in 1215. Parts of the original medieval structure remain largely incorporating the inner bailey of the castle; the outer bailey, which extended into the town, has long ago vanished under the encroachment of later shops and buildings. Having fallen into decay after c. 1300 (at the end of the Welsh wars) the castle became a domestic residence during the reign of Elizabeth I and passed to the ownership of the town council c.1600. The castle was extensively repaired in 1643 during the Civil War and was briefly besieged by Parliamentary forces from Wem before its surrender. It was acquired by Sir Francis Newport in 1663. Further repairs were carried out by Thomas Telford on behalf of Sir William Pulteney, M.P. for Shrewsbury, after 1780 to the designs of the architect Robert Adam.Gareth Williams, The Hidden Hand of Genius; Robert Adam & The Pulteney Estate in Shropshire, in Georgian Group Journal vol. XXIV pp. 65‚Äì80 The Shropshire Horticultural Society purchased the castle from a private owner and gave it to the town in 1924 and it became the location of Shrewsbury Town Council chambers for over 50 years. The castle was internally restructured to become the home of the Shropshire Regimental Museum when it moved from Copthorne Barracks and other local sites in 1985. The museum was attacked by the IRA on 25 August 1992 and extensive damage to the collection and to some of the Castle resulted. The museum was officially re-opened by Princess Alexandra on 2 May 1995. In 2019 and 2020 an archaeology project by Shropshire Council and the University of Chester undertook excavations in the castle. Work in 2019 found the remains of the original ditch surrounding the motte of c.1067, along with a range of medieval pottery and two arrow heads or crossbow-bolt heads. Excavations in 2020 failed to locate St Michael's chapel, but did recover evidence of 'high-status feasting', including the bones of a pike and possibly a swan. Collection The museum combines the collections of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry and the Shropshire Yeomanry. Laura's Tower overlooks the surrounding townscape and countryside and is often used as a backdrop for functions and weddings.

It is used as a method of purification for proteins, as well as preventing protein denaturation due to excessively diluted samples during experiments. The salt concentration needed for the protein to precipitate out of the solution differs from protein to protein. This process is also used to concentrate dilute solutions of proteins. Dialysis can be used to remove the salt if needed. Principle Salt compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions. This property is exploited in the process of salting out. When the salt concentration is increased, some of the water molecules are attracted by the salt ions, which decreases the number of water molecules available to interact with the charged part of the protein. There are hydrophobic amino acids and hydrophilic amino acids in protein molecules. After protein folding in aqueous solution, hydrophobic amino acids usually form protected hydrophobic areas while hydrophilic amino acids interact with the molecules of solvation and allow proteins to form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules. If enough of the protein surface is hydrophilic, the protein can be dissolved in water. When salt is added to the solution, there is more frequent interaction between solvent molecules and salt ions. As a result, the protein and salt ions compete to interact with the solvent molecules with the result that there are fewer solvent molecules available for interaction with the protein molecules than before. The protein‚Äìprotein interactions thus become stronger than the solvent‚Äìsolute interactions and the protein molecules associate by forming hydrophobic interactions with each other. After dissociation in a given solvent, the negatively charged atoms from a chosen salt begin to compete for interactions with positively charged molecules present in the solution. Similarly, the positively charged cations compete for interactions with the negatively charged molecules of the solvent. This process is known as salting out. Soaps are easily precipitated by concentrated salt solution, the metal ion in the salt reacts with the fatty acids forming back the soap and glycerol. Application As different proteins have different compositions of amino acids, different protein molecules precipitate at different concentrations of salt solution. Unwanted proteins can be removed from a protein solution mixture by salting out as long as the solubility of the protein in various concentrations of salt solution is known. After removing the precipitate by filtration or centrifugation, the desired protein can be precipitated by altering the salt concentration to the level at which the desired protein becomes insoluble. One demerit of salting out in purification of proteins is that, in addition to precipitating a specific protein of interest, contaminants are also precipitated as well. Thus to obtain a purer protein of interest, additional purification methods such as ion exchange chromatography may be required.

These proteins' basic amino acids bind to the acidic phosphate groups on DNA. lambda repressor helix-turn-helix transcription factor bound to its DNA targetCreated from PDB 1LMB The restriction enzyme EcoRV (green) in a complex with its substrate DNACreated from PDB 1RVA DNA-binding proteins are proteins that have DNA-binding domains and thus have a specific or general affinity for single- or double-stranded DNA. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes more functional groups that identify a base pair. However, there are some known minor groove DNA-binding ligands such as netropsin, distamycin, Hoechst 33258, pentamidine, DAPI and others. Examples DNA-binding proteins include transcription factors which modulate the process of transcription, various polymerases, nucleases which cleave DNA molecules, and histones which are involved in chromosome packaging and transcription in the cell nucleus. DNA- binding proteins can incorporate such domains as the zinc finger, the helix- turn-helix, and the leucine zipper (among many others) that facilitate binding to nucleic acid. There are also more unusual examples such as transcription activator like effectors. Non-specific DNA-protein interactions Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA- protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones. In prokaryotes, multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation. These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group (HMG) proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. Biophysical studies show that these architectural HMG proteins bind, bend and loop DNA to perform its biological functions. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that form chromosomes. Proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases. Binding to specific DNA sequences In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to specific DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one specific set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences near their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This alters the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase. These DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome. Thus, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Thus, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to read the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible. Mathematical descriptions of protein-DNA binding taking into account sequence-specificity, and competitive and cooperative binding of proteins of different types are usually performed with the help of the lattice models. Computational methods to identify the DNA binding sequence specificity have been proposed to make a good use of the abundant sequence data in the post-genomic era.  Protein‚ÄìDNA interactions  Protein‚ÄìDNA interactions occur when a protein binds a molecule of DNA, often to regulate the biological function of DNA, usually the expression of a gene. Among the proteins that bind to DNA are transcription factors that activate or repress gene expression by binding to DNA motifs and histones that form part of the structure of DNA and bind to it less specifically. Also proteins that repair DNA such as uracil-DNA glycosylase interact closely with it. In general, proteins bind to DNA in the major groove; however, there are exceptions. Protein‚ÄìDNA interaction are of mainly two types, either specific interaction, or non- specific interaction. Recent single-molecule experiments showed that DNA binding proteins undergo of rapid rebinding in order to bind in correct orientation for recognizing the target site. = Design = Designing DNA- binding proteins that have a specified DNA-binding site has been an important goal for biotechnology. Zinc finger proteins have been designed to bind to specific DNA sequences and this is the basis of zinc finger nucleases. Recently transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been created which are based on natural proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. = Detection methods = There are many in vitro and in vivo techniques which are useful in detecting DNA-Protein Interactions. The following lists some methods currently in use: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay is a widespread technique to identify protein‚ÄìDNA interactions. DNase footprinting assay can be used to identify the specific site of binding of a protein to DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation is used to identify the sequence of the DNA fragments which bind to a known transcription factor. This technique when combined with high throughput sequencing is known as ChIP-Seq and when combined with microarrays it is known as ChIP-chip. Yeast one-hybrid System (Y1H) is used to identify which protein binds to a particular DNA fragment. Bacterial one-hybrid system (B1H) is used to identify which protein binds to a particular DNA fragment. Structure determination using X-ray crystallography has been used to give a highly detailed atomic view of protein‚ÄìDNA interactions. = Manipulating the interactions = The protein‚ÄìDNA interactions can be modulated using stimuli like ionic strength of the buffer, macromolecular crowding, temperature, pH and electric field. This can lead to reversible dissociation/association of the protein‚ÄìDNA complex.

Biography Paul Johnson orbited the peripheries of the British comic book industry in the early 1980s, self-publishing and appearing in short-lived publications such as Psst! and Escape Magazine. His first major comics work was the graphic novel London's DarkLondon's Dark review, Ninth Art, January 2003 but he came to international attention when he painted the art on The Road to Nowhere, the fourth and final chapter of The Books of Magic mini- series, written by Neil Gaiman and released by DC/Vertigo in 1993. Johnson worked abroad for Marvel Comics (Interface, Hellraiser, Children of the Voyager), DC Comics (Mercy, Invisibles, Legends of the Dark Knight) and Dark Horse Comics (Aliens) before working in Britain's home-grown industry for Crisis, 2000 AD, and the Eaglemoss publication Spinechillers. In 2000 Johnson was awarded a grant by the Arts Council of Great Britain to run a series of comic book workshops with Ed Hillyer (also known as Ilya) at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in the publication of Hospitales, which was distributed free of charge in hospitals across the UK. In addition to his interest in comics, Johnson wrote regularly for the IPC music magazine Uncut from 1999 to 2004. Influenced by the work of European comics artists such as Moebius (Jean Giraud), Hugo Pratt, Alberto Breccia and Lorenzo Mattotti, Johnson struggled to find work that interested him as most commercial publishers failed to make the jump from producing superhero comics to the more esoteric genres of their continental counterparts. Disillusioned with the opportunities available to him, Johnson retrained as an acupuncturist and herbalist. He is now in private practice and lectures regularly at LCTA, England's largest college dedicated to teaching Traditional Chinese Medicine. He is the chief presenter on How To Locate Acupuncture Points - The Definitive DVD, released in 2008.

Koodli is the place where two rivers, the Tunga River and Bhadra River, meet to give rise to the Tungabhadra River.  Location  Koodli is 16 km from Shivamogga, a place where rivers Tunga and Bhadra flow together, hence the name Koodli. It has a smartha monastery stated to have been founded in the 16th century by Jagadguru Narasimha Bharathi Swamigalu of Sringeri. Within the premises of the matha, there are shrines of Sharadamba and Shankaracharya. Outside, there are two temples of Hoysala times dedicated to Rameshwara and Narasimha. Koodali is also known as Varanasi of the south. It is home to Rushyashrama, Brahmeshwara, Narasimha and Rameshwara temples. The 600-year-old mutt of Shankaracharya still stands with inscriptions of Hoysala and Okkeri kings.  History  Tunga Joins Bhadra in Koodli Hoysala style at the Sangama Ornate entrance to the main shrine inside the Rameshvara temple A small shrine inside the Rameshvara temple The place has a historic value, with temples of near Hoysala time. There are shasanas carved near the temples that indicate the era when they were built. The exact dates are disputed, but the sculptures date back to age old Indian culture and look exotic. There are various temples - small and large ones built by the rulers who ruled this place in the age old era.  Religion  The 12th century Rameshwara Temple is located in the area. There is also a Sri Chintamani Narasimha Swamy Temple beside the Sangameshwara temple. It is believed to be installed and worshipped by Sri Prahlada. The rivers are worshipped and considered to be sacred. A small temple with Nandi denotes the exact point where the two rivers meet, and is considered to be sacred. There are two mutts (schools) in Koodli. One is Shankara mutt (Advaita Philosophy) & the other being Akshobhya Thirtha Mutt (Dvaita Philosophy). =Shankara Mutt = There is very old Indian style school of learning for Shankara philosophy, called the Koodli mutt. This has a long history: Once upon a time in the 15th or 16th century, the chief swamy of Shringeri had been on a teerthayaatre, probably to Kashi. He did not return for a long time, which caused the deputy chief to take up the chief's position. But the chief was alive and did return to Sringeri after a few days. But he of course could not go in to the mutt where his own pupil was the chief, so he left Sringeri and started his own mutt at the sangama of Tunga and Bhadra, Koodli and this came to be known as Koodli Sringeri Mutt. Now in the beginning of the 1900s, a new swami took the position of the chief swamy here. He was formerly the teacher of his highness Krishnaraja Wodeyar the 4th, Maharaja of Mysore. This brought good times to this mutt again. Between the original founder and this person, a few talented persons had been chiefs here which made this place keep up the standards. After independence, one particular person was very talented and influential and made the mutt a noted place again. = Koodli Arya Akshobhya Thirtha Mutt = The Mutt was established by Sri Akshobhya Thirtha (a prominent disciple of Sri Madhvacharya) around the 13th or 14th century. This matha was bifurcated when Akshobhya theertha fell ill and his disciple Sri Jayatirtha was on pilgrimage. Knowing that the time had came for him to enter vrindavana, he ordered one of his disciples to be the pontiff of the Uttaradi Math till Sri Jayatirtha returned. Akshobhya tirtha named him as Sri Trailokyabhushana tirtha, and went into the vrindavan. He had ordered Sri Trailokyabhushana theertha to return all the belongings and deity's of Sri Uttaradi Matha to Sri Jayatirtha once he came back from pilgrimage, in a ceremonius way, and ordered that Sri Jayatirtha would become the next pontiff of Sri Uttaradi Math. So when Sri Jayatirtha returned, Sri Trailokyabhusana handed him all the belongings and deity's of Sri Uttaradi Matha, in a ceremonious way. Seeing the respect of Sri Trailokyabhushana, Sri Jayatirtha handed him some idols and belongings of Sri Uttaradi Matha and advised him to create his own samsthana. So Sri Trailokyabhushana founded Sri Koodli Arya Akshobhya Tirtha Matha at Koodli. The mutt has a rich tradition and is famed for its knowledge of Sanskrit & Madhvacharya's philosophy. There have been three peetadhipathis till date. The current peetadhipathi is H.H. Sri Raghuvijaya Thirta.

He was grand prince of Kiev (1236‚Äì1240, 1240, 1241‚Äì1243); and he was also prince of Pereyaslavl (1206), of Novgorod-Seversk (1219‚Äì1226), of Chernigov (1223‚Äì1235, 1242‚Äì1246), of Novgorod (1225‚Äì1226, 1229‚Äì1230), and of Halych (1235‚Äì1236). Archaeological evidence reveals that Chernihiv towns enjoyed an unprecedented degree of prosperity during his period which suggests that promoting trade was a priority for him. Commercial interests, in part, also motivated him to seize control of Halych and Kiev because they were channels through which goods from the Rhine valley and Hungary passed to Chernihiv (Ukraine). He also negotiated commercial treaties and political alliances with the Poles and the Hungarians. He alleviated the tax burden of the Novgorodians and granted their boyars greater political freedom from the prince. He was the last autonomous senior prince of Kiev, where he was deposed not by a more powerful prince but by the invincible Mongols. On the eve of Mongol invasion, he was one of the most powerful princes in Rus'. He has been accused of ineffective leadership because he failed to unite the princes of Rus' against the invaders; in his defense it must be pointed out that this was an impossible task. Mikhail was the first prince of the Olgovichi (the dynasty of Chernigov) to become a martyr according to the commonly understood meaning of the word: he underwent the penalty of death for persistence in his Christian faith. He and his boyar Fedor (Theodore) were tortured and beheaded by the Tatars. They later became known as \\"The Passion-Sufferers of Chernigov\\" and \\"The Miracle-Workers of Chernigov\\". His early life He was the only known son of prince Vsevolod Svyatoslavich (who later became grand prince Vsevolod IV the Red of Kiev), by Anastasia, the daughter of grand duke Casimir II of Poland. The patrimonial domain of his father was located in the northwestern part of the Vyatichi lands where he undoubtedly spent his childhood. Saint Nikita Stylites When Mikhail was a child, he suffered from a paralyzing illness. His grandfather, grand prince Svyatoslav III Vsevolodovich of Kiev gave much wealth to churches in unsuccessful attempts to obtain a cure. Finally, he heard of the miracle- worker Nikita living in the Monastery of St. Nicetas at Pereyaslavl-Zalessky in Suzdalia. The prince, accompanied by boyars, rode to the town and arrived at the monk's pillar. The stylite gave his staff to one of his boyars to take to the prince; Mikhail took hold of it, was cured, and walked to the miracle- worker's pillar for his blessing. Following his cure, he gave a generous benefaction to the monastery and ordered a stone cross to be erected, according to one source on 16 May 1186, on the spot where he was cured. Although the event is reported only in late sources and embellished with pious details, the account has a ring of truth. In the summer of 1206, his father seized Kiev, sent his posadniki to all the Kievan towns, and forced grand prince Rurik Rostislavich to withdraw to Vruchiy (today Ovruch in Ukraine). Vsevolod Svyatoslavich also evicted Yaroslav Vsevolodovich (son of grand prince Vsevolod Yuryevich of Vladimir) from Pereyaslavl, and gave the town to Mikhail. However, Rurik Rostislavich was determined to regain control of Kiev, and expelled Vsevolod Svyatoslavich with relative ease. Rurik Rostislavich also ordered Mikhail, who had only a small retinue at his disposal, to vacate Pereyaslavl, and thus he withdrew to his father in Chernihiv. Some time in the summer of 1207, his father occupied again Kiev, but in October, Rurik Rostislavich rode to Kiev, drove out Vsevolod Svyatoslavich for the second time and occupied the town; Mikhail accompanied his father from Kiev. No sources report Mikhail's marriage, but evidence suggests that he married Elena Romanovna (or Maria Romanovna), a daughter of prince Roman Mstislavich of Halych in 1210 or 1211. In June 1212, prince Mstislav Romanovich of Smolensk, prince Mstislav Mstislavich the Bold of Novgorod and prince Ingvar Yaroslavich of Lutsk launched a major offensive against Vsevolod Svyatoslavich who confronted the attackers at Vyshgorod. However, the Rostislavichi occupied Kiev. Vsevolod Svyatoslavich fled from Kiev, probably accompanied by Mikhail, for the third time and sought safety in Chernihiv where he died sometime in August 1212. Mikhail probably inherited Bryn, Serensk, and Mosalsk from his father. When his uncle Gleb Svyatoslavich died between 1215 and 1220, and Mstislav II Svyatoslavich moved to Chernihiv, Mikhail, because of his status as the second in seniority, probably occupied Novgorod-Seversk. The movements of Genghis Khan and his generals In the spring of 1223, a strong Mongol cavalry corps under the command of Jebe and Subutai which had been sent by Genghis Khan to reconnoiter the \\"western lands\\" entered the land of the Cumans. Unable to withstand the onslaught, the Cumans fled to Rus' warning the princes that if they refused to send aid the same fate would befall them. At the war council of the Rus' princes it was decided not to wait for the coming of the Tatars but to attack them deep in the Cuman steppes. Mikhail also attended the meeting. The united forces of the princes went down the river Dnieper, and the first skirmish took place on the banks of the river. In this vanguard battle Mstislav Mstislavich the Bold succeeded in defeating a detachment of Mongol troops. Crossing the Dnieper, their armies marched through the steppes for 8 days before they met the main Mongol force at the banks of the Kalka River. There was no unity of command in the Russian army. The results were disastrous: a number of princes (including Mstislav II Svyatoslavich of Chernigov) had perished during the fight. Prince of Chernigov and Novgorod The Holy Saviour Cathedral of Chernihiv (1030s) Mikhail was probably among the first survivors who returned to Chernihiv. The chronicles do not tell us that Mikhail replaced Mstislav II Svyatoslavich as prince of Chernigov, but later evidence reveals that after his uncle's demise he sat on the throne of his father and grandfather in the Holy Saviour Cathedral. The ceremony probably took place around 16 June. Because princes of his generation predeceased him and had no heirs, Mikhail, in his capacity as senior prince, assumed control over a number of their domains. This accumulation of territories made him the largest landowner in the land. Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod At that time, the Novgorodians acknowledged grand prince Yuri II Vsevolodovich of Vladimir as their overlord, but they frequently challenged his appointment of princes. In 1224, his son, Vsevolod Yuryevich had to flee from Novgorod. It appears that Mikhail was already in Vladimir on the Klyazma when Yuri Vsevolodovich learnt of his son's flight. Yuri Vsevolodovich threatened the Novgorodians to attack; in response, they confirmed their loyalty to him but made a pact to die in the defense of the Cathedral of St. Sofia. Yuri Vsevolodovich, therefore, proposed that they accept Mikhail as prince. The Novgorodians agreed and, in March 1225, Mikhail occupied Novgorod. Nevertheless, Yuri Vsevolodovich demanded the sum of 7,000 novuyu as a fine from the citizens and confiscated their goods. Mikhail went to Novgorod, where he acted as Yuri Vsevolodovich's appointee and not as an autonomous ruler, with the intention of returning to Chernihiv. One of his most important tasks was to recover the Novgorodians' wares that Yuri Vsevolodovich had confiscated at Torzhok and in his own domain. Before departing from Novgorod, Mikhail invited the townsmen to send merchants to Chernihiv and declared that their lands and his would be as one. After he departed from Novgorod, the veche sent its request for a prince to Yuri Vsevolodovich's brother, prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Pereyaslavl Zalesskiy. About a year after Mikhail returned to Chernihiv, it appears he became involved in a dynastic dispute: Oleg Svyatoslavich of Kursk prepared to wage war on him. The available evidence suggests that the bone of contention was Novhorod-Siverskyi. It is noteworthy that the chroniclers accuse neither Mikhail nor Oleg of wrongdoing which suggests that each had a just cause. During the winter of 1227, Yuri Vsevolodovich, and his nephews (prince Vasilko Konstantinovich of Rostov and prince Vsevolod Konstantinovich of Pereyaslavl) came to help Mikhail against Oleg Svyatoslavich; in addition to them, Metropolitan Kirill I of Kiev also helped to reconcile Mikhail with Oleg who evidently became the prince of Novgorod Seversk. In 1228, grand prince Vladimir III Rurikovich of Kiev summoned Mikhail and attacked the latter's brother-in-law, prince Daniil Romanovich of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, who had seized the towns of Lutsk and Chertoryysk, in Kamenets. However, they failed to take Kamenets whose ability to withstand the siege is all the more impressive because Vladimir III Rurikovich allegedly attacked with all his allies. In December 1228, the common people of Novgorod rose up in arms against tysyatskiy Vyacheslav and appointed Boris Negochevich in his place, and invited Yaroslav Vsevolodovich to return according to a new agreement. They insisted that he abide by all their terms and by all the laws of Yaroslav the Wise; he also had to cancel the zaboshnitse (a special tax levied on churches which also served as warehouses), and to stop appointing his judges in the Novgorodian lands. On 20 February 1229, therefore, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich's sons (Fedor Yaroslavich and Aleksandr Yaroslavich) fled to their father. The Novgorodians got word to Mikhail, and he set out for Novgorod upon receiving the invitation; he arrived in Novgorod around the beginning of May. Mikhail and the townsmen introduced measures to waken Yaroslav Vsevolodovich's power: the veche appointed Vnezd Vodovik as the new posadnik and also removed his other administrators. After levying heavy fines on Yaroslav Vsevolodovich's supporters, the Novgorodians used the money for the benefit of the entire community by paying for the construction of a new bridge. Mikhail's pro-Novgorod legislation included granting the town officials some of the prince's power: he permitted the boyars to appoint their own judges. He also abrogated the zabozhnitse, placed a moratorium on the payment of tribute for five years on those peasants who had fled to other lands and agreed to return to their Novgorodian homes, and lessened the tax burden of the common people. After spending some three months in Novgorod, Mikhail returned home. When he departed from Novgorod, he designated his son Rostislav Mikhailovich to remain as his lieutenant, and on returning to Chernihiv he took with him prominent Novgorodians. In May 1230 he returned to Novgorod where he installed his son on the throne. Before departing, he promised the Novgorodians to return with troops by 14 September. On 8 December the Novgorodians forced Rostislav Mikhailovich to flee to his father on just the feeble pretext that Mikhail had promised to bring troops by 14 September, but it was already December and he had not come. In this way Yaroslav Vsevolodovich's supporters evicted the Olgovichi from Novgorod, as it turned out, for the last time. They summoned Yaroslav Vsevolodovich and he came on December 30. Meanwhile, a core of dissenters found refuge with Mikhail; to secure his hegemony over Novgorod, therefore, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich had to stop Mikhail from giving them support. Prince of Chernigov and grand prince of Kiev The Kievan Rus' in 1237 In the summer or autumn of 1231, Mikhail waged war against grand prince Vladimir III Rurikovich of Kiev who sent an appeal for help to Daniil Romanovich (Mikhail's brother-in-law). We are told that Daniil Romanovich came and pacified the two princes. In the autumn of 1231, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich attacked the northwest district of the Vyatichi lands. He set fire to Serensk (which was most likely the administrative center of Mikhail's patrimony), but when he besieged Mosalsk, he failed to take it. Yaroslav, however, refused to conclude peace which signaled to Mikhail that he was prepared to pursue his objective until Mikhail expelled the Novgorodian fugitives from his lands. Towards the end of 1231 Vnezd Vodovik died in Chernihiv; Mikhail had been bound to support Vodovik owing to their mutual oaths, and Vodovik's deaths released him from that obligation. Therefore, tysyatskiy Boris Negochevich and his band left Chernihiv before Easter of 1232. In 1232, troops sent by Vladimir III Rurikovich pursued and captured the princes of Bolokhoveni who had invaded Daniil Romanovich's lands and handed them over to the latter. Mikhail and prince Iziaslav Vladimirovich of Putyvl threatened to attack Daniil Romanovich if he refused to release them. Although Vladimir Rurikovich renewed his pact with Daniil Romanovich, Mikhail and Iziaslav Vladimirovich continued waging war against them. In January 1235, Vladimir Rurikovich and Daniil Romanovich attacked Chernihiv, plundered the environs and set fire to the outer town hoping to make Mikhail submit. He, however, promised Daniil Romanovich many gifts if he would desert Vladimir III Rurikovich. Daniil Romanovich agreed and attempted to persuade Vladimir to lift the siege; but Mikhail sallied out of Chernihiv at night, caught Daniil Romanovich's troops by surprise, and killed many of them. His brother-in-law barely escaped and was forced to withdraw to the Kievan land. Mikhail waited until Iziaslav Vladimirovich brought the Cumans and then rode in pursuit. The two sides clashed near Torchesk where Vladimir Rurikovich and Daniil Romanovich were defeated, and the former and many boyars were also taken captive. Meanwhile, Mikhail's allies took Kiev where he evidently made the German merchants, who had come to Kiev via Novgorod, pay redemption-fees for their goods, and then appointed his puppet, Izyaslav Mstislavich (one of the Rostislavichi) to the throne. Halych-Volhynia in the 13th-14th century At an undisclosed date after Daniil Romanovich returned to Halych from his defeat at Torchesk, its boyars rebelled and forced him to flee to Hungary. Towards the end of September, Mikhail occupied Halych, while his comrade-in-arms, Izyaslav Vladimirovich seized Kamenets. In the spring of 1236, Mikhail attacked Daniil Romanovich in Volhynia. In addition to his own retinue, he was probably accompanied by Galician boyars, the princes of Bolokhoveni, and troops from the Kievan land. He also sent Izyaslav Vladimirovich to bring the Cumans; and finally, he summoned duke Konrad I of Masovia (his maternal uncle) who had broken off friendly ties with Daniil Romanovich. The size of his attacking force suggests that he intended to capture his brother-in-law's capital of Volodymyr-Volynskyi. However, the Cumans plundered the Galician lands forcing Mikhail to abandon his campaign. Meanwhile, king B√©la IV of Hungary renewed his father's pact with Mikhail, and seemingly relinquished his claim to Halych and also agreed to give Mikhail military aid. At the beginning of the summer of 1236, Daniil Romanovich and his brother Vasilko Romanovich rallied their troops to march against Mikhail. However, he barricaded himself in Halych with his retinue, the local militia, and a contingent of Hungarians. Dissuaded from taking Halych, they sought to assuage their frustration by seizing its northern outpost of Zvenigorod, but its citizens repelled the attack. After the Hungarian troops had departed, Daniil Romanovich tried again; Mikhail attempted to placate his brother-in-law by giving him Przemy≈õl whose inhabitants had supported him in the past. Meanwhile, grand prince Yuri II Vsevolodovich of Vladimir and Daniil Romanovich formed a pact, forced Vladimir Ryurikovich, who had replaced Izyaslav Mstislavich, to vacate Kiev, and appointed Yury Vsevolodovich's brother Yaroslav Vsevolodovich to the town. The latter arrived in Kiev around March 1236; but he failed to consolidate his rule and returned to Suzdalia. After appointing his son to rule Halych, Mikhail came to Kiev where he entered uncontested. Soon after occupying Kiev, he and his son attacked Przemy≈õl and took it back from Daniil Romanovich. The people of Halych, however, summoned Daniil Romanovich around 1237, and installed him as prince; Mikhail's son fled to king B√©la IV and all the boyars of Halych submitted to Mikhail's brother-in-law. The Mongol invasion of Rus' In the winter of 1237, Batu Khan came to the frontiers of Ryazan; it is possible that Prince Yury Ingvarevich (Prince of Ryazan)Yury Ingvarevich of Ryazan sent his brother, Ingvar II Ingvarevich (Prince of Ryazan)Ingvar Ingvarevich to Chernihiv to seek help from Mikhail, but he sent no troops to the beleaguered princes. On 21 December the Mongols took Ryazan, and they plundered the treasures of the inhabitants including the wealth of their relatives from Kiev and Chernihiv. Sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in February 1238 In March 1238 the Mongols, who had routed Yuri II Vsevolodovich's troops and killed him, continued their march, and in the Vyatichi lands they came upon the town of Kozelsk, and they struggled 7 weeks to crush it. Archaeological evidence reveals that Mikhail's domains of Mosalsk and Serensk suffered the same fate. The second phase of the Mongol invasion began early in 1239; on March 3 one contingent took Pereyaslavl and set fire to it. Not long after Pereyaslavl fell, it would appear, Mikhail went to Kamenets, and organized a general evacuation of his retinue from Kiev. However, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich in Suzdalia got word of his destination; he besieged Kamenets, captured Mikhail's wife, and seized much booty, but Mikhail escaped and returned to Kiev. When Daniil Romanovich learnt that his sister (Mikhail's wife) was being held captive, he asked Yaroslav Vsevolodovich to send her to him. In the autumn of 1239, the Mongols, who had occupied Chernihiv on October 18, sent messengers to Kiev proposing peace, but Mikhail refused to submit. During the first half of 1240, we are told, Batu Khan sent M√∂ngke to reconnoiter Kiev; when his messengers came to Mikhail for the second time seeking to coax him into submitting, he defied the khan by putting his envoys to deaths. The forces in Rus' on whom Mikhail could still rely were his own druzhina and the Kievan militia, and therefore he fled to Hungary. In the chaos that preceded the invasion of the west bank of the river Dnieper, minor princelings and boyars took advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves to seize power: Rostislav Mstislavich seized Kiev, but he was evicted by Daniil Romanovich. Meanwhile, Mikhail had arrived in Hungary where he attempted to arrange a marriage for his son Rostislav Mikhailovich with the king's daughter. In the light of Mikhail's plight, B√©la IV saw no advantage to forming such an alliance and evicted Mikhail and his son from Hungary. In Mazovia, Mikhail received a warm welcome from his uncle, but he decided that the expedient course of action was to seek reconciliation and sent envoys to his brother-in-law. Mikhail pledged never again to antagonize Daniil Romanovich and forswore making any future attempts on Halych. Daniil Romanovich invited him to Volhynia, returned his wife, and relinquished control of Kiev. In the face of the Mongol attack, however, Mikhail did not return to Kiev but allowed his brother-in-law's men to remain there. Towards the end of 1240, Batu Khan encircled Kiev with his troops, and the town fell on December 6. On learning Kiev's fate, Mikhail withdrew from Volhynia and for the second time imposed himself on his maternal uncle's good graces. When, however, the Mongols also threatened Mazovia, he traveled west to Wroc≈Çaw in Silesia. As his caravan pressed northwest, it came to ≈öroda, where the local inhabitants attacked Mikhail's train; they plundered his goods and killed a number of his people including his granddaughter. The Mongols invaded Silesia, and after the invaders had passed through Volhynia and the Polish lands, Mikhail returned to Mazovia. His last years Some time in the spring of 1241, he considered it safe to go home. He stopped at the devastated town of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, rode northeast to Pinsk, and then traveled down the river Pripyat to Kiev. Unable to return to his court on the citadel because Batu Khan's official had presumably occupied it, he took up residence on an island near the Podil (Old Kyiv was razed). Significantly, Batu Khan's man did not challenge his arrival thereby indicating that the Mongols were willing to let refugee princes return to their ravaged towns without obstruction. On learning that B√©la IV had given his daughter in marriage to his son, Rostislav Mikhailovich (who had fled to the Hungarians) in 1242, Mikhail believed that his efforts to form an alliance with the √Årp√°d dynasty had finally been realized. He therefore rode to Hungary expecting to negotiate the agreements that normally accompanied such an alliance. However, his hopes were dashed: the king and his son rebuffed him when he came to the king's court. Mikhail, greatly angered by his son, returned empty-handed to Chernihiv. Meanwhile, Batu Khan commanded all the princes to visit Sarai and pay him homage. Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Suzdal was the first to respond to the summons: at the beginning of 1243, he traveled to Sarai, where Batu Khan appointed him senior prince in Rus'. After returning to Suzdal, he sent his commander to rule Kiev. Accordingly, some time during the second part of that year, Mikhail abandoned his court on the island below Kiev and returned to Chernihiv. But even there his authority was insecure: like all the other princes of Rus', he had to obtain Batu Khan's patent (yarlik) to rule his patrimony. His martyrdom and his cult Michael of Chernigov at the camp of Batu Khan (1883), painting by Vasiliy Smirnov. By the end of 1245, only Mikhail from among the three senior princes had not yet kowtowed to the conqueror. In the end, Mikhail went in time to pre-empt a Mongol punitive strike against his domain; his grandson, Boris Vasilkovich of Rostov accompanied him. When they arrived at Saray, Batu Khan sent messengers to Mikhail's camp instructing him to worship according to the laws of the Mongols by bowing to the fires and idols. Mikhail agreed to bow to the khan, but he insulted the Mongol by refusing to obey his command to worship idols. Enraged by the prince's retort, Batu Khan ordered that he be put to death. He was slaughtered by Doman of Putivls, and Fedor his boyar was killed after him. The Novgorod First Chronicle, the oldest chronicle reporting his death narrates that their bodies were thrown to the dogs; but as a sign of divine favor, their bodies remained unmolested and pillars of fire hovered over them. The chronicle narrative accounts show that the people of Rus' acknowledged Mikhail and Fedor as martyrs immediately after their deaths. Accordingly, their bodies were later brought to Chernihiv and entombed in a side-chapel dedicated to them (The Miracle-Workers of Chernigov) in the Holy Saviour Cathedral. His wife survived him and promoted his cult. His daughter Maria and her sons, Boris and Gleb Vasilkovich, inaugurated the Feast of the Miracle-Workers of Chernigov, on September 20, and built a church in their honor. Her sister, Feodula who had become the nun Evfrosinia also advanced his cult to judge from a 17th-century account which reports the existence of a wooden chapel in Suzdal dedicated to them. The cult was approved in 1547. When Chernihiv was occupied by the Poles in 1578, Ivan IV the Terrible had the relics of the two saints taken to Moscow, where they were placed in the cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel. In times of oppressions particularly, these martyrs have been regarded by the Russians as their special representatives before God. Marriage and children Michael married once and had several children, though the existence of the last four children in the list below is disputed.Nicolas Baumgarten, G√©n√©alogies et mariages occidentaux des Rurikides russes du Xe au XIIIe si√®cle, Orientalia christiana 9, no. 35 (1927): 86-88. *Elena Romanovna (or Maria Romanovna) (m. 1210 or 1211), a daughter of prince Roman Mstislavich of Halych and his wife, Predslava Rurikovna of Kiev #Feodula Mikhailovna (1212 ‚Äì 1250); became a nun and adopted the religious name Evfrosinia; #Duke Rostislav Mikhailovich of Macs√≥ (b. c. 1225 ‚Äì 1262); #Maria Mikhailovna (? ‚Äì 7 or 9 December 1271), wife of Prince Vasilko Konstantinovich of Rostov; #Prince Roman Mikhailovich of Chernigov and Bryansk (c. 1218 ‚Äì after 1288/1305); #Prince Mstislav Mikhailovich of Karachev and Zvenigorod (1220 ‚Äì 1280); #Prince Simeon Mikhailovich of Glukhov and Novosil; #Prince Yury Mikhailovich of Torusa and Bryansk.

It runs from downtown Fort Worth, Texas at the junction of Interstate 35W to Bonham, Texas, just north of a junction with U.S. Highway 82. Between Fort Worth and Euless, SH 121 is known as Airport Freeway (east of Euless, this name applies to SH 183). East of Coppell, the highway functions as the frontage road for the Sam Rayburn Tollway, a toll road that runs northeast to McKinney. From McKinney to Melissa, the state highway is concurrent with US 75 and the North Central Expressway. Northeast of Melissa, SH 121 is a less-traveled roadway often referred to as the Sam Rayburn Highway.  Route description  Grapevine Sections between downtown Fort Worth and Grapevine are freeway, including a small segment near Hurst that coincides with Interstate 820. At Bedford, Texas it has an interchange with SH 183, the Irving freeway that leads toward Dallas; it has an interchange with SH 360, which leads toward Arlington, just to the west of the north entrance to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, to which State Highway 121 gives access. At Grapevine it has interchanges with SH 114 and Interstate 635 before becoming a limited-access tollway that passes between Lewisville and Frisco. Signage originally used on the tolled mainlanes of SH 121 (now the Sam Rayburn Tollway) from 2006 to 2009. It is very heavily traveled south and west of McKinney and has become an urban highway due to the rapid growth of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Service roads extending southwest to northeast along the corridor from Lewisville to McKinney are free of charge; however the main lanes within the right-of-way are tolled as part of the Sam Rayburn Tollway operated by the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). The highway's northeastern section between Melissa and Bonham carries less traffic and until recently was a two- lane rural highway. However, in recent years with an increase in traffic, the 19 mile section between the Collin-Fannin County line and its junction with SH 56 in Bonham has been upgraded to a \\"Super Two\\" highway system. This allows for alternating passing lanes. Beginning in 2016, the segment between Melissa and the Collin-Fannin County line is being upgraded to a four-lane divided highway system. In addition, a two mile stretch between SH 56 and US 82 within Bonham city limits, was upgraded to a four-lane highway system with a continuous left-hand turn lane. Long term planning calls for upgrading the 19 mile stretch, from the Collin-Fannin County line to SH 56 in Bonham, into a four-lane divided highway system. It meets Interstate 35E at Lewisville, SH 289 near Frisco, US 75 and US 380 in McKinney, US 69 at Trenton, and SH 78 just north of Bonham. Construction began in 2009 on the extension of 121 south from Fort Worth to Cleburne, as a toll road called Chisholm Trail Parkway in Tarrant and Johnson Counties. This section is operated by the NTTA and the entire project, from IH 30 to U.S. 67 opened to traffic in 2013.http://www.ntta.org/NR/rdonlyres/3FFA8F0C-1525-445F-A169-8B47A341B396/0/NTTA_SWPCT_Brief.pdf\\", Southwest Parkway/Chisholm Trail Project Status Report March 2009 from the NTTA. In March 2009, work was completed on the eventual southbound lanes on a short stretch of 121 northeast of DFW Airport, which currently shares southbound and northbound traffic.

Interchange between SH 121 and SH 121 Business Route  Sam Rayburn Tollway  From McKinney to Coppell, State Highway 121 acts as a frontage road to Sam Rayburn Tollway, contrary to the popular misconception that the Sam Rayburn Tollway was the new SH 121. =Controversy= In early 2007, the Spanish firm Cintra agreed to a $2.8 billion, 50-year deal where they would lease the highway from TxDOT, finish building and maintain it, and collect the tolls. However, critics of the deal questioned both its length‚Äîthe contract allowed Cintra to collect tolls for 50 years‚Äîand the fact that the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) was prevented from bidding on the contract. In addition, general opposition to the toll plan organized, pointing out that the segment through Denton County had already been paid for by taxpayer money. To answer some of these complaints, Texas legislators pressed the Texas Department of Transportation to allow the NTTA to bid. The Authority announced their proposed bid in early May 2007, which would provide approximately $3.3 billion in road funding, but is based on traffic counts that differ from those used by Cintra. On June 28, 2007, the Texas Transportation Commission announced it would pursue the proposal from the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). Route history SH 121 was originally numbered on March 17, 1927 as a direct routing between Fort Worth and SH 40 near the Dallas-Denton County line. On April 24, 1928, it extended to McKinney. By 1933, the route had been completed from Ft. Worth northeast through Grapevine to its intersection with SH 40/U.S. Route 77 in far southern Denton County. On July 15, 1935, the east end was truncated to the Denton- Dallas county line. On January 6, 1939, the section from the Dallas-Denton County line to SH 40/US 77 was restored. A road was designated on February 21, 1938, from SH 114 to SH 121; either SH 114 Loop or SH 121 Loop. This was renumbered as Loop 10 on September 26, 1939. On November 24, 1941, SH 121 was extended from old US 77 to new US 77. On December 16, 1943, the section of SH 121 from US 77 (former SH 40) to McKinney was restored, and the ambitious plan to extend SH 121 northeast beyond McKinney to Bonham was approved by TxDOT, a part of which absorbed Farm to Market Road 82 between Bonham and Trenton. The section from Bonham to Randolph was designated as SH 263 until March 21, 1939. But it wasn't until 1954 that the next section of this highway was completed between U.S. 77 at Lewisville and U.S. Route 75 near McKinney. The final section between McKinney and Trenton was not completed until November 20, 1963, including an extension around the western side of Bonham. In 1965, the section from downtown Fort Worth to Interstate 820 was transferred to newly completed freeway sections. On November 31, 1969, SH 121 was rerouted over Spur 459, which was cancelled. The old route of SH 121 was given to the city of Grapevine. TxDOT proposed extending SH 121 to FM 1187, via a route to be known as the Northside‚ÄìSouthwest Freeway, on October 4, 1973. This proposed extension was canceled on August 29, 1985. On April 14, 1980, SH 121 was relocated in Bedford and Grapevine. On November 18, 1999, SH 121 was rerouted over Spur 553, which was cancelled. The old route of SH 121 became Business SH 121. On February 27, 2003, SH 121 was extended to US 67 in Cleburne.

Davis, Random House, 2006, Because \\"G√≥mez\\" is usually recognized as a family name in Spanish-speaking countries, in Hispanic America the character's name was changed to \\"Homero\\" (\\"Homer\\"). Personality Like the other members of the family, Gomez's personality became largely codified by the television series. Gomez is of Castilian extraction, which was first brought up in \\"Art and the Addams Family\\" on December 18, 1964. John Astin had long sessions with Addams and series producer David Levy, who gave him free rein in developing the character. Enlarging on Addams' description of Gomez as a Latin lover type, Astin suggested the eye-rolling, pencil moustache, and ardent devotion to Morticia. In the Addams cartoons and the television shows, Gomez wore a necktie to his chalk-stripe suit, though in the films, Gomez wears a bow tie and also wears a wide variety of extravagant clothing. He spends $1000 per month on cigars, and he is an accomplished juggler and knife- thrower. He loves crashing toy trains and diving for crabs on Halloween. When he wishes to know the time he will pull a pocket watch from the breast pocket of his coat (the chain is attached to the lapel) while simultaneously checking a wrist watch. Gomez is an athletic, acrobatic, and eccentric multi- billionaire. Though an extremely successful businessman, having acquired much of his wealth through inheritance and investments, he has little regard for money and will casually spend thousands of dollars on any whimsical endeavor. Gomez's investments are guided more by whimsy than strategy, yet luck rarely fails him. Gomez owns businesses around the world, including a swamp, bought for \\"scenic value\\", crocodile farm, a buzzard farm, a salt mine, a tombstone factory, a uranium mine, and many others. In Forbes 2007 \\"Fictional 15\\" list of the richest fictional characters, he was ranked #12 with a net worth of $2 billion. As a young man, Gomez was, per flashback in \\"Morticia's Romance,\\" a perennially sickly youth, gaining perfect health only after meeting Morticia. He nevertheless studied law (voted \\"Most Likely Never to Pass the Bar\\") and is quite proud his law class voted him \\"Least Likely to Succeed\\"; and although he rarely practices, he takes an absurd delight in losing cases, boasting of having put many criminals behind bars while acting as their defense attorney; this is somewhat contradicted in the episode \\"The Addams Family Goes to Court,\\" where it is noted that while Gomez has never won a case, he has never lost one either. In The New Addams Family, Gomez had also studied medicine. Gomez has offered contradictory views on work; in one episode, he claims that, although his family was wealthy even in his childhood, he nonetheless performed odd jobs and \\"scrimped and saved [his] kopeks,\\" which he considered character building. When his son Pugsley decided to find a job, however, Gomez was horrified, claiming that \\"No Addams has worked in 200 years!\\" In the 1991 animated series, Gomez deliberately tried to fail at something, anything, only to realize in the end of the episode that he is only a failure in failure. This is additionally contradicted in \\"New Neighbors Meet the Addams Family\\" Season 1 : Ep. 9 (1964). He specifically states that Thing always beats him at bridge. Portrayals Raul Julia (left) as Gomez in the 1991 live-action film. In the 1960s American television series, Gomez was portrayed by John Astin. Astin also voiced this character in an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies which featured the family. In the first animated series by Hanna- Barbera, Gomez was voiced by Lennie Weinrib. In the second animated series, also by Hanna-Barbera, Gomez's voice was again performed by John Astin. Gomez was played by Raul Julia in The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993). After Julia died in 1994, Tim Curry took up the role in the television film Addams Family Reunion in 1998 and in 1999 Gomez was played by Glenn Taranto in the TV series The New Addams Family, where he returned to the madcap attitude of his original 1960s incarnation with Astin guest starring as Gomez's grandfather. In the Broadway musical, Gomez was initially played by Nathan Lane and later by Roger Rees. The films differ from the television series in several ways, most significantly that Fester is Gomez's brother (in the television show, he was Morticia's uncle). The Addams Family notes that Gomez's parents were murdered by an angry mob, though in one scene in the sequel, when Gomez catches Fester with a pornographic magazine, they both look at the centerfold (unseen by the viewer) and fondly say \\"Mom\\". In Addams Family Values, Gomez and Morticia have a third child named Pubert, a seemingly indestructible baby with a thin, black moustache like his father. Oscar Isaac voiced Gomez in the 2019 computer-animated adaptation of The Addams Family and will reprise the role in its 2021 sequel.

Two subspecies are recognised. It is endangered and has disappeared from much of its former range. Taxonomy and naming The New Zealand kaka was described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788. There are two subspecies, the North Island kaka, Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis, and the South Island kaka, N. m. meridionalis, although more recent research has ruled out allopatric subspeciation. The MƒÅori language name kƒÅkƒÅ means \\"parrot\\", possibly related to kƒÅ, 'to screech'. The genus Nestor contains four species: the New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), the kea (N. notabilis), the extinct Norfolk kaka (N. productus), and the extinct Chatham kaka (N. chathamensis). All four are thought to stem from a \\"proto-kaka\\", dwelling in the forests of New Zealand five million years ago. Their closest relative is the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus).Juniper, T., Parr, M. (1998) Parrots: A guide to parrots of the world. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press () Together, they form the parrot superfamily Strigopoidea, an ancient group that split off from all other Psittacidae before their radiation. Description The New Zealand kaka, like many parrots, uses its feet to hold its food The New Zealand kaka is a medium-sized parrot, measuring in length and weighing from , with an average of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . It is closely related to the kea, but has darker plumage and is more arboreal. The forehead and crown are greyish white and the nape is greyish brown. The neck and abdomen are more reddish, while the wings are more brownish. Both sub-species have a strongly patterned brown/green/grey plumage with orange and scarlet flashes under the wings; colour variants which show red to yellow colouration especially on the breast are sometimes found. This group of parrots is unusual, retaining more primitive features lost in most other parrots because it split off from the rest around 100 million years ago. The calls include a harsh ka-aa and a whistling u-wiia.Falla RA, Sibson RB & Turbot EG (1966) A Field guide to the birds of New Zealand. Collins, London () Distribution and habitat The New Zealand kaka lives in lowland and mid-altitude native forest. Its strongholds are currently the offshore reserves of Kapiti Island, Codfish Island and Little Barrier Island. It is breeding rapidly in the mainland island sanctuary at Zealandia with over 800 birds banded since their reintroduction in 2002. From their reintroduction in 2002 the North Island kaka continue to re- colonise Wellington and a recent report shows a significant increase in their numbers over the last 12 years. Behaviour Kaka are mainly arboreal and occupy mid-to-high canopy. Often seen flying across valleys or calling from the top of emergent trees. They are very gregarious and move in large flocks often containing kea where present. Kaka enjoy dismantling pine cones to eat the seeds inside. Kaka feeding on tree buds in early spring, Wellington Botanic Gardens =Diet= Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre. thumbA North Island kaka at Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, Wellington, New Zealand The New Zealand kaka eats fruits, berries, seeds, flowers, buds, nectar, sap, plants and invertebrates. It uses its strong beak to shred the cones of the kauri tree to obtain the seeds. It has a brush tongue with which it feeds on nectar, and it uses its strong beak to dig out the grubs of the huhu beetle and to remove bark to feed on sap. Kaka drilling in to get tree sap fledgling in a nest in the Wellington Botanic Gardens Kaka pair feeding each other via regurgitation Fledgling climbing a tree in the Wellington Botanic Gardens thumb =Nesting= Six eggs laid by a North Island kaka in a wooden nestbox at Zealandia EcoSanctuary. New Zealand kaka make their nests in hollow trees, laying clutches of 2 to 4 eggs in late winter. Both parents assist in feeding the chicks. In a good fruiting year pairs can double clutch often utilising the same nest hole for the second clutch. It is unusual for a pair to raise more than three chicks in a clutch. young kaka begging for food Conservation status The New Zealand kaka is considered endangered (CITES II). It has greatly declined across its traditional range as a result of habitat loss, predation by introduced predators such as cats, rats, possums and stoats, and competition from wasps and bees for the honeydew excreted by scale insects. A closely related species, Nestor productus, the Norfolk kaka, became extinct in 1851 for similar reasons. =Predation= Predatory mammals are responsible for the loss of an estimated 26 million native birds and their eggs each year in New Zealand. As cavity nesters with a long incubation period that requires the mother to stay on the nest for at least 90 days, kaka are particularly vulnerable to predation. Stoats were the main cause of death of nesting adult females, nestlings and fledglings, but possums were also important predators of adult females, eggs and nestlings. There is strong evidence that predation of chicks and females has led to a serious age and sex imbalance, even amongst ostensibly healthy populations. In parts of the country, the Department of Conservation and local conservation groups have attempted to control predators of kaka through the use of traps, ground baiting and the aerial deployment of sodium fluoroacetate (1080). Where pest control has been carried out, there has been significant recovery of kaka populations. For example, in Pureora Forest Park 20 kaka were radio-tracked in an area to be treated with aerial 1080 in 2001. In nearby Waimanoa Forest, which was not to be treated with 1080, nine kaka were radio-tracked. In the area where 1080 was used, all 20 birds survived that season. Of the nine birds tagged in the untreated area, five were killed by predators that same season. =Competition= Research has shown that honeydew is very important for breeding birds, especially those breeding in southern beech forests. The difficult nature of controlling the wasps makes the New Zealand kaka's future very uncertain.  Human interaction  The increase in the population of North Island kaka in Wellington has led to birds visiting residential gardens and reserves and this in turn has led to more interactions with people. People have been feeding the birds unsuitable food such as nuts, various grains and cheese. Feeding kaka has resulted in metabolic bone disease in kaka chicks. In 2016 80% of the kaka chicks being monitored by the Wellington City Council died from this disease. There have also been instances of kaka nesting in the roofs of houses.

It is one of the two land hermit crabs commonly sold in North America as pets, the other being the Caribbean hermit crab (C. clypeatus).Audrey Pavia: Hermit Crab PG.18 Retrieved July, 2009Barren's: Hermit Crabs PG.9  Features and identification  thumb C. compressus is a member of the phylum Arthropoda and the class Malacostraca. They can be up to in length and are thought to be one of the smallest species of land hermit crabs. They have four walking legs, a small pincer, a large pincer, and antennae. Many people who keep these hermit crabs as pets notice that Ecuadorian crabs can be relatively fast walkers, even faster than Caribbean hermit crabs, and that they are quite active. Their eyes are more oval-shaped when compared to the round eyes of Caribbean hermit crabs and are thicker. Their big claw has four or five small ridges on the upper part. The tips of the second pair of walking legs are darker than the rest of the leg. The abdomen of the Ecuadorian hermit crab is short and fat. Ecuadorian hermit crabs vary greatly in colour, some are bright (yellow, dark grey, or orange), but more often they are a tan colour. Sometimes, they may have a blue or green tint to their bodies or the insides of their legs. They also have comma-shaped eyes, unlike the \\"purple pincher\\" (C. clypeatus), which has dot-shaped eyes. When choosing a shell, they tend to give preference to shells with a wide and round aperture. As with all hermit crabs, painted shells are harmful to them, as they often eat the paint chips and can be poisoned with chemicals used in the paint. This significantly shortens their lives.  Habitats  Native to Ecuador and Chile, these hermit crabs live on the Pacific seashore around tidal pools and high-tide zone. Their bodies have adapted to this seashore existence, and in captivity, they require access to seawater, as they must metabolize the salt in it and bathe in it to maintain gill moisture. Failure to provide access to seawater (real or artificial) will result in death. Like most hermit crabs, they are scavengers and consume seaweed, dead fish, and other detritus that washes up on the shore.  Studies  C. compressus prefers the odors of foods that they have not recently eaten. Hermit crabs exposed to one food for at least 9 hours preferred foods having other odors for the next 6 hours. This short-term avoidance of food (like human beings who get bored with the same meals over and over again) compels the crabs to seek out a wider range of food. This might be advantageous to the crabs, possibly through the consumption of a more nutritionally balanced diet. Ecuadorian hermit crabs can make a chirping sound to communicate with each other. As pets Hermit crabs overall were once seen as a \\"throwaway pet\\" that would live only a few months, but species such as C. clypeatus have a 23-year lifespan if properly treated and some have lived longer than 32 years. Alternate Citation: Similarly, Ecuadorian hermit crabs have been known to live to over 30 years. In general, and despite their moniker, hermit crabs are social animals that do best in groups. They also require a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment (ideally around 80% humidity or above and 75-85¬∞F), and adequate substrate to allow them to bury themselves while molting.

She was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 2015, representing the riding of Kildonan‚ÄîSt. Paul for the Liberal Party of Canada, and served as Minister of Employment, Workforce and Labour in the federal Cabinet until the January 10, 2017, cabinet shuffle by Justin Trudeau. She lost her seat in the House of Commons in the 2019 Canadian federal election. She was previously a cabinet minister in the government of Manitoba New Democratic Premier Gary Doer from 1999 to 2004. Mihychuk resigned to run for Mayor of Winnipeg in 2004, but was defeated by Sam Katz. Life and career Mihychuk was born in Vita, Manitoba, the daughter of Katherine Salamandyk and M√©tro Mihychuk. She received the degrees of Bachelor of Arts from the University of Winnipeg in 1979, and Master of Science from Brock University in 1984. She is certified as a Practicing Professional Geoscientist. Mihychuk worked as a geologist in Newfoundland and Labrador from 1984 to 1986 and in Manitoba from 1986 to 1992. In 1992, she married Kenneth Marshall. She has two daughters, Sarah Mihychuk and Hannah Mihychuk, and a son, John. Mihychuk was first elected as a Winnipeg School Division Trustee first in 1989 and was re- elected in 1992. =Provincial politics= She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1995, defeating Liberal leader Paul Edwards by 3,109 votes to 2,853 in the Winnipeg constituency of St. James. The 1995 election was won by Gary Filmon's Progressive Conservatives. Mihychuk and 22 other New Democrats formed the Official Opposition. The NDP won the following general election in 1999. This time Mihychuk was elected in the constituency of Minto, defeating Progressive Conservative Harry Lehotsky by 4,534 votes to 2,035. Gary Doer was sworn in as Premier and named Mihychuk Minister of Industry, Trade and Mines. Mihychuk was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 2003, winning almost 70% of the votes cast in her constituency. On November 4, 2003, she was named Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade, with responsibility for International Relations Coordination. =Post-provincial politics= Mihychuk resigned from cabinet and the legislature on May 21, 2004, to seek election as Mayor of Winnipeg. The 2004 election was held to determine the successor to former mayor Glen Murray. Murray had resigned to seek election to the House of Commons of Canada. Mihychuk's campaign platform focussed on increasing Winnipeg's population. Mihychuk lost this election, winning ten percent of the municipal electorate's vote. In 2005 Mihychuk relocated to Toronto, Ontario to work for the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) as Director of Regulatory Affairs. Mihychuk supported Lorne Nystrom's campaigns to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995 and 2003. =Federal politics= In 2014, Mihychuk was chosen as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Kildonan‚ÄîSt. Paul for the 2015 federal election, defeating the previous Liberal candidate, Victor Andres. Mihychuk said that her views on the economy and social views were closer to those of the federal Liberals. She was subsequently elected to the seat. She was the Minister of Employment, Workforce, and Labour from November 4, 2015, until a cabinet shuffle in January 2017. She was accused of being abusive and causing confusion by the Canadian Red Cross after visiting a shelter for evacuees from forest fires affecting Garden Hill First Nation in 2018, a formal complaint was filed against her to the federal government. She was accused of adding to the chaos and suggesting to evacuees that they should go to Selkirk, Manitoba, and on her advice 40-50 evacuees waited in the cold with their belongings for transportation to Selkirk that never arrived. Indigenous people had requested her assistance because the Red Cross was ignoring them and placing families in large centre mixed in with a population that had people convicted of sexual offenses. Mihychuk pushed the Red Cross to treat the evacuees with respect and only after advocating were the large centres closed down and the evacuees placed into hotels. While Red Cross officials were upset, the evacuees expressed their satisfaction with the outcome to Indigenous MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette.

The Quarry is the main recreational park in Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, England. The park was created in 1719 and encompasses 29 acres. With a location within easy walking distance of Shrewsbury town centre, Shrewsbury Sixth Form College and Shrewsbury School, it is the most heavily used public park within the county. Sites of interest =The Dingle= A centrepiece to the park is The Dingle, a former stone quarry, but now a landscaped sunken garden. Between 1324 and 1588 it was known as the Wet or Water Quarry because it was liable to flood. It was quarried for both stone and clay. The project to clear out the Dingle and then plant it was funded by the Shropshire Horticultural Society, with the ornamental gardens opened in 1879, featuring many flower beds and borders, with ponds and fountains. Although there are still formal planted beds, in recent years the planting scheme has become more naturalistic in style, reflecting modern tastes. A statue of the goddess Sabrina was presented by the Earl of Bradford in 1879. The inscription on the statue is based on a poem by John Milton (1608‚Äì1674). In myth, Sabrina was a nymph who drowned in the Severn. Another feature in the Dingle is the Shoemakers' Arbour. Associated with the pre-Victorian town festival, and originally sited in Kingsland, it was moved to the Dingle in 1879. It dates from 1679 and includes statues of Crispin and Crispinian, the patron saints of shoemakers. The gateway is built of stone, and bears the date of 1679 and the initials, H. P. and E. A.; the wardens of the Shoemakers' guild at that time. The Shoemakers' Arbour plays a large part in the song \\"Thomas Anderson\\" by David Harley that describes the execution in 1752 of a participant in the Jacobite rising of 1745. There are numerous memorial benches and plaques within the Dingle. Of special interest is a bust of Percy Thrower, formerly Shrewsbury Parks Superintendent. According to local legend, the Dingle is haunted by the ghost of Mrs Foxall, a local woman who was burnt at the stake nearby in the sixteenth century as punishment for witchcraft and murder. =Bandstand= This bandstand, which stands below the entrance to the Quarry in Shrewsbury, was built in 1879 and donated to the park by the Shropshire Horticultural Society. The bandstand is used by military bands during Shrewsbury Flower Show. Other uses include as a dry place for people practising fire arts, and other activities which require shelter from the rain. Between 2006 and 2008 the bandstand had a DJ playing music on most Saturdays during the day. =Harley Stone= This small boulder is said to be the anchor stone of the last surviving grazing allotment in the Quarry. This belonged to the Harley family, livestock were tied to the stone by a leash of no more than 16 yards in length. These 'circular' allotments once made use of the entire herbage ensuring that the grass was kept short through the entire year. This stone marked the boundary made by the Harley family of Rossall near Bicton who refused to sell their piece of land to the corporation when the rest of the Quarry was being acquired in the 18th century. =War memorial= Shrewsbury's main civic war memorial, the focus for Remembrance Sunday, is situated within the Quarry. near St Chad's Terrace. It consists of a bronze winged and armoured statue of St. Michael under a canopy designed like a classical Greek temple in the form of six Ionic columns supporting a circular dome. It is inscribed: 'Remember the gallant men and women of Shropshire who gave their lives for God, King and country 1914-18 and 1939‚Äì45'. This War Memorial was built in 1922-3. It was designed by George Hubbard and Son and built in Portland stone. The richly embellished floor shows the County, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) Regimental arms and French Croix de Guerre on a gold mosaic background. The seals or arms of the six boroughs of the County are embossed on the inside frieze. The bronze figure of Saint Michael beneath the canopy is by Allan G Wyon and was cast at the foundry of A.B. Burton of Thames Ditton. St. Michael the Archangel is viewed as the field commander of the Army of God. In late medieval Christianity, Michael, together with Saint George, became the patron saint of chivalry. Michael is also considered in many Christian circles as the patron saint of the warrior. =Victoria Avenue= The broad traffic-free avenue that runs along the River Severn is called Victoria Avenue and the largest avenue that runs downhill from the town centre to Victoria Avenue is Gloucester Avenue. The latter was known as Central Avenue, but in 1974 Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester came to the Shrewsbury Flower Show and the avenue was dedicated to her. A special feature of Victoria Avenue are the rows of lime trees on each side. These are actually the second generation of trees to be planted. Thomas Wright first planted avenues of hybrid limes in the Quarry in 1719. They had reached heights of over 40 metres by the early 1950s when they were felled on the orders of Percy Thrower. A falling branch had killed a young girl and so the trees were considered unsafe. It was felt that the trees had originally been planted too close together. The felled trees were found to contain bee and wasp nests, large amounts of mistletoe and much dead wood. They were replaced with hybrid limes at much wider spacing which are now reaching maturity. The clone that was planted produces a large number of epicomic sprouts which have to be pruned off annually. Opposite the School Boathouse is the remains of a wooden post used by a ferry crossing the river. In 1900, there were two ferry boats working on the River Severn in the Quarry, with the other operating across the river where Porthill Suspension Bridge has been sited since 1922. Events =Shrewsbury Flower Show= The Shrewsbury Flower Show is an annual event held in mid-August over two days (in recent times Friday and Saturday) within The Quarry. The show is organised by the Shropshire Horticultural Society and is one of the largest events of its type in the United Kingdom. It is also one of the longest-running shows in the country and featured in the 2005 Guinness Book of Records as the 'longest- running flower show\\" in the world.' =Live music= Recently The Quarry has been used as a live music venue, with performances in 2005 from Jools Holland and Will Young. The Sugababes appeared in July 2006. Such events are not without controversy within the town, with complaints that the public park is closed to all but paid ticket-holders during these events, preventing its use for informal recreation. A controversial live-music event by Jessie J in July 2012 was heavily criticised for leaving the Quarry like a mud bath and for excessive litter, with fears that future events may have been put in jeopardy. =Other events= The river is a focus for the Shrewsbury Regatta and Dragon Boat Races in May and June. As The Quarry is open space close to the town centre, it is often used in civic festivals, such as the annual Darwin Festival. Shrewsbury Carnival and Show is held here every June. The Quarry in flood Although the Quarry is sloping, low-lying parts are part of the natural overflow area for the River Severn in times of high flows. As a relatively low intensity land use, the Quarry is allowed to flood preferentially to other more built-up areas of the town. The boat launching jetty by Porthill Bridge is under water many times during a typical winter, with Victoria Avenue and the children's playground flooded perhaps once a year. Every few years, river flows are such that flood water almost reaches the Bandstand. A causeway of higher ground has been constructed to allow people to walk from Porthill Bridge towards St Chad's Church during most flood events.

The name Kennebecasis is thought to be derived from the Mi'kmaq \\"Kenepekachiachk\\", meaning \\"little long bay place.\\" It runs for approximately 95 kilometres, draining an area in the Caledonia Highlands, an extension of the Appalachian Mountains, inland from the Bay of Fundy.Kennebecasis Watershed, Kennebecasis Watershed Restoration Committee Description The river's source is in the foothills of Albert County, near the rural community of Goshen. It runs southwest through the community of Penobsquis; several tributaries join the river in the town of Sussex several kilometres further west. Between Sussex and the river's junction with the Saint John River at Millidgeville (part of Saint John), the Kennebecasis River runs through a well-defined river valley which has become one of the primary land transportation routes in the southern part of the province, hosting the Route 1 expressway and the Canadian National Railway line to the Port of Saint John. The upper two thirds of the Kennebecasis River passes through pastoral rural countryside consisting of Acadian mixed forest and various agricultural areas, notably dairy farms around Sussex. Southwest of Sussex, the river becomes increasingly larger as it passes the communities of Norton and Hampton, before it empties into a delta-like area informally called the Hampton Marsh. West of Hampton, the Kennebecasis flows in a broad fjord-like glacial valley which defines the southern side of the Kingston Peninsula. At its junction with the Saint John River, the Kennebecasis River helps to form Grand Bay. Several large islands can be found in the river, such as Kennebecasis Island just off-shore from Summerville on the Kingston Peninsula, and uninhabited (with the exception of a few summer cottages & an Off The Grid Community on the southern part of the island) Long Island, located near Rothesay. =Hampton Marsh= Image:River in Hampton.JPGThe river widens as it flows through the Hampton Marsh. Image:Hampton Marsh April.jpgHigh water in the Hampton Marsh in April 2008. Image:Hampton Marsh June.jpgThe same area in June 2008, demonstrating the difference in water level. Image:Hampton Marsh.jpgThe lower end of the Hampton Marsh looking across to Darlings Island. Lower Kennebecasis River valley Quispamsis, looking at the Kingston Peninsula. The communities of Nauwigewauk, Quispamsis and Rothesay become increasingly urban as the river approaches its junction with the Saint John River. The lower Kennebecasis River valley is largely a suburban/exurban region for Saint John. The area is outside the summer 'fog belt' for the Bay of Fundy and enjoys more sunshine year-round than Saint John. It is also substantially colder in winter than the Bay of Fundy-climate-controlled city proper. \\"The Valley\\" or \\"KV\\", as the lower Kennebecasis River valley is called by locals, has experienced dramatic population growth over the past several decades, largely owing to the development of Route 1 through the area in the 1960s. Once a minor dormitory suburb of the Saint John area, the towns of Rothesay and Quispamsis constitute a moderately-sized population centre with some commercial development. Saint John, by contrast, has suffered from an erosion of its tax and commercial bases as population and businesses have migrated away from the urban core. The Kennebecasis effectively isolates the Kingston Peninsula from suburban sprawl. It is crossed by two ferry services, the Gondola Point Ferry that connects Gondola Point to Reeds Point, and the Summerville to Millidgeville Ferry that connects Millidgeville to Summerville. A third ferry service, the Kennebecasis Island Ferry connects Summerville to Kennebecasis Island. Several controversial proposals have been made in recent decades to build a highway bridge over the Kennebecasis River to the Kingston Peninsula however this has been rejected by numerous provincial governments citing financial pressures as well as the likelihood of suburban sprawl occurring in this farming area as a result. The Kennebecasis River valley communities have rich histories; many were settled by Loyalists in the 1780s and 1790s who traveled upriver from Saint John to land grants offered by the British government. They became more prominent during the late 1800s following construction of the European and North American Railway through the area, which allowed for easier travel between Saint John and Moncton. Over the ensuing decades, the lower Kennebecasis River valley became a summer vacation destination for wealthy Maritimers, Americans and central Canadians. It is also a popular cruising destination for recreational boating as a result of its connection with the navigable portions of the Saint John River.

The garden front Attingham Park is an English country house and estate in Shropshire. Located near the village of Atcham, on the B4380 Shrewsbury to Wellington road. It is owned by the National Trust. It is a Grade I listed building. Attingham Park was built in 1785 for Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick, who received his title in 1784 during the premiership of Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. Noel Hill was a politician who aided William Pitt in the restructuring of the East India Company. Noel Hill already owned a house on the site of Attingham Park called Tern Hall, but with money he received along with his title he commissioned the architect George Steuart to design a new and grander house to be built around the original hall. The new country house encompassed the old property entirely, and once completed it was given the name Attingham Hall.Douglas, p.4 The Estate comprises roughly 4,000 acres, but during the early 1800s extended to twice that amount at 8,000 acres (3,000 hectares).Douglas, p.40 The extensive 640 acres (270 hectares) parkland and gardens of Attingham have a Grade II* Listed status. Over 470,000 people visited the house in 2017/18, placing it as the fourth most popular National Trust house. Across the 640 acre parkland there are five Grade II* listed buildings, including the stable block, the Tern Lodge toll house which can be seen on the B4380, and two bridges that span the River Tern. There are also twelve Grade II listed structures including the retaining walls of the estate, the bee house, the ice house, the walled garden, the ha-ha, which can be seen in the front of the mansion, and the Home Farm.  Historical use of the site  The archaeology of Attingham Park is diverse covering many different periods of history and human habitation. People have lived around the area of the estate for around 4,000 years since the Bronze Age, utilising the rich alluvial soils for agriculture. There are seven scheduled ancient monuments across the wider estate including an Iron Age settlement, Roman forts and a significant portion of the fourth largest civitas in Roman Britain, Viroconium, on the site of the nearby village of Wroxeter.Douglas, p.38 There are also Saxon palaces, and a mediaeval village which was called Berwick Maviston. Today the remains of a moat and fish ponds from the old manor can still be seen. The manor and the village dated back to the Norman invasion, being mentioned in the 1086 Domesday book. The original manor fell into disrepair in mediaeval times; another house known as Grant's Mansion was recorded on the site in 1790. The village was occupied until the late 1700s when the newly created Baron Berwick built Attingham and removed the village from his land. The title of Baron Berwick comes from the name of this village.  History  Attingham, including Cronkhill, was the seat of the Barons Berwick until that title became extinct in 1953. On the death of Thomas Henry Noel-Hill, 8th Baron Berwick (1877‚Äì1947) who died childless, the Attingham Estate, comprising the mansion and some 650 acres, was gifted to the National Trust. Attingham Park was designed by George Steuart, a follower of James Wyatt, whose only surviving country house this is.Jenkins, 638 It was built from 1772 to 1785 for Noel Hill, 1st Baron Berwick, on the site of an earlier house called Tern Hall (which had been built to his own designs by Richard Hill of Hawkstone). The proportions have been criticised: for Simon Jenkins \\"The facade is uncomfortably tall, almost barracks-like, the portico columns painfully thin\\".Jenkins, 638 There is a large entrance court, with an imposing gatehouse, and two single storey wings stretch out to either side of the main block. In 1805 John Nash added the picture gallery, a project that was flawed from the beginning as it suffered from leaks. Constructed using cast iron and curved glass to give the effect of coving, it throws light into the gallery below. In 2013 work began on building a new protective roof above the delicate Nash roof, replacing one installed in the 1970s with a new one which will stop leakage and reduce natural weather wear. The new roof will have temperature control, blinds, and UV resistant glass. The 2nd baron went bankrupt, and all the contents of the house were auctioned in 1827; some were reacquired later.Jenkins, 638 The main reception rooms were divided into a male and female set on either side of the house. Angelica Kaufmann decorated a boudoir and there are three of her paintings in the drawing room.Jenkins, 638 Kitchen at Attingham The nearby Italianate villa of Cronkhill on the estate is an important pioneer of this style in England. It was designed by John Nash for the 2nd Lord Berwick, as a generous gesture for his friend and agent, Francis Walford,\\"A generous gesture for a friend\\" according to the National Trust; other sources imply that Walford was Nash's patron in this project. during the same time the Picture Gallery and staircase was being built. Once a part of the wider estate, it is now isolated on a hillside overlooking the riverside. Although the villa is owned by the National Trust, it is privately tenanted and only open for visitors a few days of the year. During the First World War, Attingham was owned by Thomas, the 8th Lord Berwick. He had let the property to the Dutch-American Van Bergen family who encouraged the establishment of a hospital for wounded soldiers at Attingham. The hospital opened in October 1914 and by 1918 had 60 beds and an operating theatre. During the First World War, the 8th Lord Berwick served with the Shropshire Yeomanry and as a diplomat in Paris. Throughout the war years he corresponded with Teresa Hulton, whom he married in June 1919. During the First World War, Teresa Hulton had worked with Belgian refugees in London and as a Red Cross nurse in Italy. The internal courtyard Between 1948 and 1971, an Adult Education College occupied the hall, run by Sir George Trevelyan. In 1952 the Attingham Trust was set up by George Trevelyan and Helen Lowenthal, the purpose of the Attingham Trust being to offer American curators the opportunity to learn about British country houses. A summer school has been run by the Attingham Trust every year since 1952 and now takes in a diverse array of country houses around the United Kingdom including none National Trust properties. The Attingham name has since been used worldwide with the American Friends of the Attingham Trust being founded in 1962 in New York City, and the Attingham Society being founded in 1985. The Attingham Society covers the whole world and alongside the American Friends its purpose is to keep its members in touch and the continued education and interest of British country houses. Attingham Park is now the regional headquarters of the National Trust and also on the estate is the Shropshire office of Natural England.  The Estate  The park was landscaped by Humphry Repton and includes woodlands and a deer park, with between 200 and 300 head of Fallow deer (according to season). The estate has a walled garden and an orchard, which grows fresh produce which is used on the estate in the tearooms, and sold to visitors. The meat from the Fallow deer is also sold in the shop during the shooting season, in winter and early spring. The River Tern, which flows through the centre of the estate, joins the larger River Severn at the confluence just south of the Tern Bridge. Repton attempted to build a weir, the remains of which can now be seen, near the confluence but due to flooding it was washed away. The park is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest due to it being home to many rare species of invertebrates. The amount of deadwood left by fallen trees around the parkland makes it the perfect habitat for a variety of different species, primarily beetles. There are seven units of SSSI around the park totalling to 190 hectares or 470 acres, nearly three-quarters of the entire estate.

First administered statewide in 1998, it replaced the State Student Assessment Test (SSAT) and the High School Competency Test (HSCT). As of the 2014-2015 school year FCAT was replaced in the state of Florida. The Florida Department of Education later implemented the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) for English Language Arts, Reading, Mathematics and a Writing or typing test. A Comprehensive science test is still used for grades 5 and 8.  Administration and use  The FCAT (Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test) was administered annually, in late February and early to mid- March as well as April, to all public school students in grades three through eleven. Students in grades three through ten are required to take the reading and math portion every year. Private and parochial school students are not required to take the FCAT; most of these schools administer another standardized test instead, such as the Stanford Achievement Test, which is exactly the same as the FCAT NRT, formerly taken by public school students. FCAT Science is administered annually to public school students in the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades. In the fourth, eighth, and tenth grades, public school students take the FCAT Writes exam (formerly called \\"Florida Writes!\\" and \\"FCAT Writing+\\"); unlike the other tests, the FCAT Writes exam is administered in early February to allow adequate time for scoring before the end of the school year. Students' results from the FCAT are compiled to generate a grade for each public school. Under this plan, public schools receive a grade from A to F, based on what percentage of students pass the exams and what percentage of both the entire student body and the bottom 25% of the school demonstrate adequate growth on the exam over their previous year's performance. If a school improves a letter grade (including schools that improve from an F to a D), or maintains an A, the state direct-deposits \\"reward money\\" to the school in the amount of $75 per student enrolled (this amount used to be $100 before the 2008 recession). This money is not collectively bargained or funneled through the recipient school's district. Schools can use the money for staff bonuses, educational equipment, materials related to boosting student performance, or to hire temporary personnel to assist in improving student performance. Most of the money typically goes toward teacher bonuses, however. As of the 2010-2011 school year it has been called the \\"FCAT 2.0\\" On actual test material it is labeled \\"FCAT 2.0 Next Generation Sunshine State Standards.\\" As of the 2014-2015 school year, many grades do not take the FCAT, and it has now been formally replaced with the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA). http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2014/11/24/meet-floridas-new-statewide- test/  Promotion and graduation  When originally introduced, students in fourth grade were required to pass the reading portion of the test in order to be promoted to the fifth grade. After passage of the No Child Left Behind Act by the United States Congress in 2001, the mandatory passage was moved from fourth grade down to third grade, so as to align Florida with federal statutory requirements. In addition to the third grade requirement, public school students in Florida must also pass the tenth grade FCAT, not only in reading, but also in mathematics, in order to be eligible to receive a high school diploma. Grade 3 and graduation are the only two instances in which federal or state statute require passage of the FCAT; it is given at the other grades for the intention of providing diagnostic information, both on students and schools. However, many counties in the state have adopted other promotional requirements tied to the FCAT, but these are at the discretion of each individual county school board. Exceptional education (ESE) students were able to waive the FCAT requirement to get a Standard High School Diploma. Those ESE students wishing to obtain a regular high school diploma must score a passing grade on the FCAT or receive a waiver for the FCAT. In order to get the waiver, ESE students must prove that they have taken several steps to try to pass the FCAT and must also show that they have improved every time they have taken the test.  Options after failing the FCAT  A student failing the tenth grade test‚Äîthat is, the test required for graduation‚Äîis allowed approximately five additional opportunities to pass it prior to graduation. Originally, students were given four more chances to pass the test after failing it in 10th grade‚Äîin October and March of both their junior and senior years in high school. However, starting in 2006, students were provided an additional test administration during the summer between school years. Students, however, may not retake the Grade 10 FCAT during the summer between their sophomore and junior year because additional time is needed for remediation. If students do not pass the FCAT prior to their scheduled graduation, they may continue to retake it until they pass it to earn a standard high school diploma. If a student completes the minimum number of credits for high school graduation, but does not pass the FCAT, he or she may still be allowed to graduate with a certificate of completion. Students may substitute the appropriate subject-area score from either the ACT or SAT. A score of 19 on either the Reading or Mathematics sections of the ACT or a 280 on the Reading and a 370 on the Mathematics sections of the SAT can be used to waive the FCAT requirement after the student has failed the 10th grade test at least three times. Students may earn the concordant passing score prior to taking the FCAT Retake Reading or Mathematics examination three times, but they cannot substitute it in lieu of the passing FCAT score until they have taken the FCAT Retake Reading or Mathematics examination three times. In any case, students will receive a Certificate of Completion that allows for admittance in any state community college for which they have met all graduation requirements apart from passing the FCAT. Students may also transfer their credits to a private or out-of-state school. Several high schools in North Carolina and South Carolina regularly market in Florida on radio stations annually during the spring and early summer, advertising their 'service' that is available to 'graduating' Florida high school students who for whatever reason failed to pass the FCAT and were unable to receive a high school diploma, despite having excellent grade point averages and having completed all course requirements for a high school diploma.  Scoring  The FCAT is either machine-scored or hand-scored, depending on the section. Multiple-choice and gridded-response questions are machine-scored. Performance tasks, such as short-response, extended-response, and essay items, are hand- scored. Like several other standardized tests, the raw score does not directly reflect the final score; some questions are considered to be of a higher difficulty level than others and, therefore, carry more scoring weight. This type of scoring is called Item Response Theory (IRT).  Criticism  Though the system was designed to reward public schools for excellence in teaching, many educators and community members have criticized the program, claiming that the program takes funding from schools which need it most. It has also been criticized by many students and teachers because the schools put too much emphasis on the FCAT and not enough on preparing students for the real world. The FCAT tests have also come under fire from education groups and parents for encouraging teachers to teach students how to pass a test, rather than to teach students the fundamental material in the core subjects such as English. Another point of criticism on the FCAT is that all students of the same grade take the same test, despite the fact that different students are enrolled in different courses. To compensate for this, in many schools, teachers are directed to cover FCAT skills, regardless of what subject they are supposed to be covering. Retired teacher and Lakeland, FL political activist Carol Castagnero has been a harsh critic of the FCAT and ran for several offices to highlight her opposition to the exam. Castagnero called the test \\"unconstitutional\\" during her 2006 campaign for Governor and stated during her 2008 Congressional campaign that \\"children are being terrorized with a test called FCAT.\\" DOE says students must take FCAT ¬ª Local News ¬ª Suwannee Democrat Writers such as Diane Ravitch claim that high-stakes testing is driven by corporate interests rather than student and teacher interests.http://dianeravitch.com/dianes-books/  End-of-Course Assessments (EOC)  As of the 2010‚Äì11 school year, high school students in Florida in grades (9‚Äì12) will be required to pass End-of-Course exams for eligibility to obtain credit in the course in which the EOC exam was administered. The End- of-Course Assessments are being used to replace the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).The Algebra I EOC exam was the first end-of-course exam to be administered for Florida back in Spring 2011. As of now, the following EOC exams are being administered for Florida: Algebra I, Geometry, Biology, U.S. History. For the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the Algebra I EOC exam was worth 30% of the student's final grade. As for the 2011‚Äì12 school year, the Algebra I EOC exam was pass or fail. The students must achieve a 70% score (Level 3) or higher to be considered passing the Algebra I EOC exam. For 2012‚Äì13 school year, incoming ninth graders must pass not only the Algebra I EOC Exam, but also the Biology EOC to earn a high school diploma. The End-of-Course exams are used to ensure that the student has learned all the content in the course. End-of-Course exams are not required for students with specific learning disabilities. All EOCs are administered school-wide throughout a week, ensuring no issues occur while students are signing into the program. This has happened, on the first instance of EOC testing in the 2010‚Äì11 school year during the Algebra I exam. The exams are taken on a computer, generally on a standard model for all students to guarantee fairness. It is compulsory that students complete the test in a single sitting, being provided with as much as time as is necessary. However, rare is the time that a student needs more than the two provided 80-minute sessions. All necessary and admitted tools are provided electronically through the service. FCAT Explorer FCAT Explorer was an internet-based tool designed to help Florida students in grades 3‚Äì11 pass the FCAT by focusing on mastery of the Sunshine State Standards through several interactive programs. Each student received a unique username and password to access these programs, and schools in Florida often set aside time during the day to work specifically on FCAT Explorer. It now redirects to another website with resources for Florida students.FCAT Explorer See also * Florida Department of Education * Education in Florida References External links * FCAT Home Page * FCAT Reports View reports of scores by county and/or grade level * FCAT Explorer * FCAT Online * FCAT Test Maker FCAT Test Maker is Florida's leading provider of FCAT Practice Tests, Progress Monitoring and Formative Assessment tools. * Florida Department of Education * Interactive Map of Florida FCAT Scores by School, District and Zip Code Standardized tests in the United States Public education in Florida 1998 introductions 1998 establishments in Florida 2014 disestablishments in Florida ","title":"Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test"},{"id":"966728","text":"Tumbleweeds is an American comic strip that offered a skewed perspective on life on the American frontier. Writer-artist Tom K. Ryan (June 6, 1926 ‚Äì March 12, 2019Tom K. Ryan Obituary, Muncie, IN Star Press, 4/21/2019) (who signed the strip \\"T.K. Ryan\\") was very familiar with conventions of the Western genre he satirized. Launched September 6, 1965, the strip was distributed for decades initially by the Register and Tribune Syndicate and later by the King Features Syndicate after its acquisition.After a 42-year run, Ryan retired and, rather than let it become a \\"zombie strip\\", brought Tumbleweeds to a conclusion on December 30, 2007. Jim Davis, who created Garfield, was Ryan's assistant (from 1969 to 1978) while developing another strip, Gnorm Gnat.Tumbleweeds at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on September 3, 2015. Characters and story Tumbleweeds is set in and around the town of Grimy Gulch, whose population was stated as 49 (later it was crossed out and incremented to 50, and sometimes is revised down when the villain Snake-Eye leaves town), in an unspecified Western territory. Other locations include the nearby village of the Poohawk tribe of Native Americans, and the United States Army outpost Fort Ridiculous, manned by the 6 7/8 Cavalry. =Grimy Gulch= *Tumbleweeds, the main character, is a laconic cowpoke who would rather be anywhere else, but has no real ambition to do anything. Like his namesake, he is content to tumble wherever human foibles may carry him. His worst nightmare is to be caught by, and married to, Hildegard Hamhocker. *Blossom, Tumbleweeds' first horse; usually found asleep. *Epic, Tumbleweeds' toothless, alcoholic, plug-chewing, sway-backed second horse; once a U.S. Cavalry horse, but drummed out of the service. *Ace DeSilk, a professional gambler, Tumbleweeds' best pal and a very smooth operator. *Judge Horatio Curmudgeon Frump is the magistrate/mayor of Grimy Gulch, a pompous windbag who became Justice of the Peace and boasts that he cannot be bought, but is open to \\"rental fees\\"! *The Sheriff, a man with a ridiculous handlebar moustache, is the short-handed \\"long arm of the law.\\" *Deputy Knuckles, comic relief who does not carry a gun, but has a yo-yo instead. *Quiet Burp is a diminutive lawman from Texas. His name, a play on Wyatt Earp, is a character name also used in the comic strip Rick O'Shay. *Hildegard Hamhocker, the town's only known woman, is drawn as a stereotypical homely old maid, trying to snag Tumbleweeds as a husband. *Echo is an orphan girl. Cute and precocious, she knows how to use those qualities when necessary. She is Hildegard's adopted niece. *Pajamas is Echo's lazy pet dog ‚Äî so lazy that when it dreams, it dreams of sleeping. *Claude Clay is Grimy Gulch's undertaker, whose motto is, \\"You plug 'em ... I plant 'em.\\" *Wart Wimble is a gravedigger who works for Clay. *Blackie is Grimy Gulch's saloon keeper. *Soppy Sopwell is the town drunk. *Grover Galley is the dotty editor of the Desert Denouncer newspaper. *Percy is a sardonic newsboy and copyboy for the Denouncer. *Dusty Dewlap is a local cattle rancher. He only hires Tumbleweeds when he is desperate. *Snake-Eye McFoul is an outlaw. He visits Grimy Gulch from time to time to rob the bank and/or kill somebody. *Snookie is Snake-Eye's little brother, who suffers from an overactive pituitary gland. Though only 12, he appears to be in his thirties. He dresses in \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" outfits. Attends the John Wesley Hardin Memorial Elementary School. *Ham and Beans are muleskinners. Beans, who is short and loud-mouthed, screams at the big, gentle Ham for pampering the mules to the point of carrying them around like infants. *Slats is a cowboy who is always leaning on the fence. *Hogarth Hemp is the town hangman. *Clodwell Gunkley who apparently wandered into the wrong strip, according to whoever he encounters, is a semi-effeminate bulk of a man whose speech patterns are somewhat similar to those of Ed Wynn. Ace was pleased to learn that Gunkley had wandered into the strip, because \\"If there's a way in, there's a way out!\\" =The 6 7/8 Cavalry= *Colonel G. Armageddon Fluster, commander of the 6 7/8 Cavalry and Fort Ridiculous, is a parody of George Armstrong Custer. The Poohawk Chief refers to him as \\"Goldilocks\\" and \\"Poopsie.\\" *The 6 7/8 Cavalry consists of a major and troopers under Fluster's command. *The General is Fluster's superior. *Mole Eye, a scout from Fort Ridiculous, is usually shown coming in from the desert with a couple of arrows sticking out of his back; he wears a buckskin with the word \\"Scout\\" on his hat. =The Poohawks= *The Poohawk Chief is always lamenting his tribe's pathetic standing. *Little Pigeon is the Poohawk Chief's daughter, and \\"a flower among the weeds\\". *Limpid Lizard is a klutzy Poohawk (Indiandom's answer to Daffy Duck) and a suitor to Little Pigeon. His word balloons consist of misspelled words and homonyms. *Green Gills is a Poohawk who was an early suitor to Little Pigeon. *Lotsa Luck is a very rich Poohawk, depicted for years as mute and communicating by writing notes. He eventually started using a very posh voice when he had vocal cords cloned from William F. Buckley Jr. surgically implanted. He was a suitor for Little Pigeon. *Drudgeworth is a chauffeur employed by \\"Lotsa Luck\\" to \\"drive\\" his horse. *The Poohawk medicine man. *Screaming Flea is the smallest Poohawk, formally speaking in ornate word balloons. He is very sensitive about the size of his nose, which is enormous. *Bucolic Buffalo is the biggest and strongest of Poohawks, but he is not very smart. A running gag is that when anyone [such as \\"Lotsa Luck\\") makes him angry, he sends them \\"South\\" {into the ground.) He is another suitor for Little Pigeon. *Rain Drop is a boy, the only apparent child in the Poohawk Tribe, and at least as smart as some of the adults. *Hulking Hawk is a fearsome tribe-member and a more suitable suitor to Little Pigeon than Limpid Lizard, according to the Poohawk Chief. *Purple Polecat operates the trading post. Appearances in other media Tumbleweeds was to be one of the strips animated in Filmation's 1978 series Fabulous Funnies (along with Broom-Hilda, Nancy, Alley Oop and others) and was included in the series' premiere episode with Alan Oppenheimer doing the voice of the title character. However, after the first episode aired, it was learned that Filmation lacked the rights to use the property, and the segment was removed from future episodes. Tumbleweeds made another animated appearance in The Fantastic Funnies, a 1980 television special that showcased numerous comic strips. One of the strips was animated, courtesy of Bill Melendez Productions. Tumbleweeds Gulch became an MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park attraction, and the strip also was the basis for a Las Vegas stage show. In 1983, Tumbleweeds was adapted into a musical comedy for high school productions by the same company that adapted the strip Luann.

It was produced by Tsuburaya Productions, Ultracom Inc. and DIC Productions, L.P., with distribution by All American Television, and ran for a duration of 53 episodes from September 12, 1994 to April 11 the next year in syndication, as well as on ABC. It was an adaptation of the Japanese tokusatsu series Denkou Choujin Gridman (or Gridman the Hyper Agent) (from Tsuburaya). The series was originally going to be named PowerBoy, but was renamed Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad during production to avoid confusion with Saban Entertainment's American tokusatsu series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad was made to capitalize on the upsurge in popularity of imported Japanese monster-robot shows which could be adapted with new, regionalized live-action footage. The series development mirrored the creative construct established earlier with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The master toy licensee, Playmates Toys, funded the series, interpolated American development via toy licensing rights, and did a commercial buy-in on the Fox network, where Haim Saban had established a kids block with programs such as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers and the 1992 X-Men cartoon. Playmates called upon the development team at DIC‚Äîwhich, coincidentally, was working with Pangea Corporation, which assisted in the development of DIC's New Kids on the Block and Playmates's earlier hit, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. DIC, Pangea, and Playmates's marketing group created an ensemble of character names, traits and profiles, which were spun into a series offering. Under a product placement deal, Compaq computers were prominently featured in the series and were used to generate the show's computer-generated graphics. Elements of this series are used in the anime series adaptation of Gridman, the Hyper Agent, SSSS.Gridman. The \\"SSSS\\" abbreviation in the title references Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad. Plot High school student Sam Collins, the head of a band known as Team Samurai, is zapped during a recording session by a power surge and disappears, only to return seconds later with a strange device attached to his wrist which, at the time, is unremovable. Later after his friends, Amp, Sydney, and Tanker, leave, one of his video game programs, dubbed Servo, is subject to a power surge and zaps Sam again just after he has remarked \\"Cool battle armor!\\" - this time he is pulled into the digital world and transformed into his creation. As Servo, he roams the digital world and fights monsters dubbed Mega-Viruses which are capable of attacking any device on the electrical grid (including the grid itself), Internet or telephone network, usually having real-life consequences far beyond what any standard computer virus would be capable of achieving. Meanwhile, Malcolm Frink, another student from Sam's school, is designing monsters on his home computer when Kilokahn, an escaped military artificial- intelligence program that was presumed destroyed in the power surge, visits him via his computer screen and strikes a Faustian deal with him, transforming his digital monster into a Mega-Virus. Sam, now as Servo, must enter the digital world and stop Malcolm's and Kilokahn's Mega-Viruses. Sometimes, when Servo is unable to handle a virus by himself, he would enlist the help of his friends using his Arsenal Programs which could fight the viruses solo, transform, with the help of other Programs, and attach to Servo as armor. Since Team Samurai consists of only 3 people at any one time following Sam's disappearance, only 3 vehicles are available for use at any one time. When Servo combines with these Programs as armor, he changes his name to either Phormo once combined with Drago or Synchro once combined with Zenon. Characters =Team Samurai= The main character, Servo * Sam Collins / Servo (portrayed by Matthew Lawrence) - The frontman and guitarist of his band, Team Samurai. He is always willing to help anyone in need or be their friend and often vies for the attention of cheerleader Jennifer Doyle, having been in and out of relationships with her, sometimes even competing with Malcolm Frink for her affections. He even goes so far as to try to be friends with Malcolm, although Malcolm never returns the favor. He is clever and easygoing. He also loves his (unseen) little sister, Elizabeth, though often feels pestered by her shenanigans. * Tanker (portrayed by Kevin Castro) - Sam's best friend, the band's drummer, and a somewhat stereotypical athlete. He is particularly adept at school sports, especially football. He has a crush on fellow Team Samurai member Sydney, especially admiring her for her intelligence. He always seems to have a large appetite, and as evidenced in the episode \\"A Break in the Food Chain\\", he goes crazy if he eats nothing for a duration. He also holds a particularly strong dislike for Malcolm Frink. In Syberspace, Tanker's uniform was a black biker suit with a black helmet and a see-through visor. * Sydney \\"Syd\\" Forrester (portrayed by Robin Mary Florence) - The band's keyboard player and the brains of the group. She is also a good singer, as shown in \\"His Master's Voice\\". She is one of North Valley High's brightest students, and often displayed a caring personality. She is the object of Tanker's affection, and the two enjoy being together. Sydney's Syberspace uniform was a pink biker suit with a gold helmet and a see-through visor. * Amp Ere (portrayed by Troy Slaten) - The team's so-called \\"space cadet\\" and the band's bass player. He becomes the band's bass player after revealing to them that his brother (who was originally intended to join them instead of Amp) was going back to college. His intelligence is curious, as he either is clueless to his surroundings or displays some unusual intellect. He has an unorthodox way of performing tasks, such as writing in a notebook using his toes or studying by eating book pages with milk and sugar. To enter Syberspace, he always uses a different phrase to be humorous. Amp's uniform consisted of a helicopter helmet and leather jacket. It is later revealed that Amp is really an alien and returns to his own planet with his parents off- screen. * Lucky London (portrayed by Rembrandt Sabelis) - A surfer and Amp's replacement in Team Samurai. His attitude was often laid-back, sometimes to the dismay of Principal Pratchert. In Syberspace, Lucky's uniform is a red and white jet ski helmet with a black visor and life jacket. =Supporting characters= * Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Doyle (portrayed by Jayme Betcher) - Sam's on- again/off-again girlfriend and a cheerleader at North Valley High School. Malcolm tries to compete for her affections. In the alternate version, Jen is a genius who liked Malcolm befriended and helps Sam get back to his normal universe. * Principal Pratchert (portrayed by John Wesley) - The school principal who is usually strict, particularly when dealing with antics caused by either Sam and/or Malcolm. When his daughter loses the student council presidency to Malcolm in \\"The President's a Frink\\", he initially refuses to recount the votes when Malcolm comments it would make the Education Board suspect he was playing favorites and could do so only when he agreed that Malcolm could use his parking space should he remain victor. Pratchert would reconsider recounting the votes when Mrs. Starkey wisely suggests he does so for not only the sake of his job but also his daughter Yolanda. He does and it is revealed Malcolm rigged the votes using Skorn so he can win, so Pratchert punishes him by making him move his car out of his parking space for an undisclosed time in detention. In \\"Pratchert's Radical Departure\\", it is revealed that Pratchert used to be a hippie when he was younger - Malcolm uses this to his advantage by creating a Mega-Virus monster that makes him think he was a hippie again, much to the delight of Lucky London (at least until the Mega-Virus's destruction by Servo). * Mrs. Rimba \\"Cha-Cha\\" Starkey (portrayed by Diana Bellamy) - The cafeteria lunch lady who often cracks jokes relating to the poor quality of the food she serves, such as enjoying her hobby of riding her motorcycle and being married multiple times. She also seems to have an affinity for Dennis Quaid, as mentioned in a few episodes. She is the only faculty member in North Valley High School who doesn't like Malcolm. When Pratchert was depressed over Yolanda refusing to talk to him, Starkey wisely suggests he does the right thing and recount the votes and admits her suspicion that the voting was rigged. After the recount and although Mrs. Starkey pretends to forget suggesting it, she is touched that Pratchert does value her opinion. * Yolanda \\"Yoli\\" Pratchert (portrayed by Kelli Kirkland) - The principal's daughter and Jennifer's closest friend. She's North Valley High School's student council president, a position she temporarily loses in \\"The President's a Frink\\" when Malcolm cheats his way into office (with the help of a virus) but she regains it when Principal Pratchert recounts the votes after Servo defeats the virus sent to change the results. In \\"What Rad Universe!\\", an alternate dimension version of Yolanda finds companionship in Kilokahn making her that dimension's version of Malcolm while the Malcolm of that dimension is a good person much like the real Yoli and Sam. * Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Collins (voiced by Kath Soucie) - Sam's \\"unseen\\" younger sister who communicates with her brother off-screen through a laundry chute connected from the upstairs. She always plays pranks on her older brother, usually dropping things on top of him through the chute. Liz has shown she does care for Sam and drops a ton of cookies to share with him. =Villains= * Kilokahn (voiced by Tim Curry) - Short for \\"Kilometric Knowledge-base Animate Human Nullity,\\" Kilokahn is a military artificial intelligence program who unleashes computer viruses to attack major computer systems. He derisively refers to humans as \\"meat-things.\\" He considers himself the ruler of the digital world and also wishes to take over the real world (Earth) starting with its computer network. * Malcolm Frink (played by Glen Beaudin) - A loner who dresses in black garb and also attends North Valley High School. He only finds companionship in Kilokahn. Using a special program, he designs the Mega- Viruses which are brought to life by Kilokahn and sent into a specific electronic object. Most of the Mega-Viruses are either designed on his computer or have their drawings image-scanned into his computer so that Kilokhan brings them to life. Sam sees that Malcolm is alone and tries to strike up a friendship with him, but Malcolm rejects his offers stating that he likes being alone. The only exceptions to that rule are in \\"His Master's Voice\\" when Malcolm was touched by Sydney's apology and in \\"Kilo is Coming to Town\\" when he finally realizes that his selfish nature nearly cost Sam his life. Malcolm has a very strong dislike of Tanker and is intimidated by Mrs. Starkey. He derives enjoyment out of hurting others with his computer viruses which he creates and Kilokahn brings to life. In spite of Kilokahn's regular betrayal of him and lacking any other 'friends', Malcolm always comes back to him. He even purposely restores Kilokahn to his sociopathic self after he is temporarily rendered harmless. In the alternate universe version, Malcolm is a generous and caring person who likes to help people unlike the alternate Yoli who takes pleasure from harming others. Mega-Virus Monsters The Mega- Virus Monsters are Kaiju-style computer viruses produced by Malcolm and given sentience by Kilokhan. Malcolm creates the Mega-Viruses since Kilokhan lacks the ability. Only a few Mega-Viruses have the power of speech. * Kathod - The very first virus that Servo ever fought after Malcolm first met Kilokhan. Kathod was a long-tailed turtle-style creature who mostly crawled on four legs (though once during the battle, he was up on two) and had two volcano holes built into its shell, from which he could erupt powerful fireballs. He could also breathe fireballs at will. Kathod was brought to life by Kilokhan in \\"To Protect and Servo\\" to tamper with phone communications on Malcolm's request so that Sam would not call Jennifer. Around the same time, a freak accident with Sam's computer turns him into Servo for the first time and is transported to where Kathod is causing havoc. After a fierce battle, Kathod was destroyed by Servo's Grid Power Punch. In \\"Just Brown and Servo,\\" Kathod went into every car engine to tamper with it until it was destroyed by Servo. * Blink - Blink is an armored cycloptic virus with skilled fighting techniques. He was sent into the police files in \\"Samurize\\" in order to create false arrests including one on Jennifer during her date with Sam as the police were looking for Sam. He wielded dual metal combat sticks with pointy ends. When he proved to be too much for Servo, Tanker boarded Drago and went into the sytstem to aid Servo. By combining him with Drago, they became Servo's upgrade known as Phormo. During this part of the battle, Blink took his two sticks and merged them into one long, double-edged combat stick. It would do him no good in the end though, because he ended up getting taken out of the picture by Phormo, who used a special Grid Power Fire Stream that erupted from the gem on Phormo's chest. * Trembulor - This was a large black spike-covered virus who, hence his name, could shake wildly, causing tremors in Syberspace. He was sent into the government's defense satellites in \\"Samurize, Guys!\\" to create an electrical barrier around Sam's house, trapping Sam and the rest of Team Samurai inside when they were to appear for a band performance at North Valley High School that night. As Servo, Sam went in to battle the virus. This monster demonstrated the ability to suck up Servo's main power right through the gem on Servo's chest. Servo lost 80% of his power after this move, so Sydney tried to program some help for him. She, Tanker and Amp were thrust into their vehicles (Borr, Tracto, and Vitor, respectively) for the very first time. They used their vehicles to aid Servo in battle, and soon merged with him to create the Synchro program. Synchro's formation turned the battle back in Team Samurai's favor, and he proceeded to destroy the virus by launching his Shoulder Drill Missiles directly at him. Servo faced him twice later on in the series, and both times he used the Synchro program to win the battles. In \\"Foreign Languages,\\" Trembulor is upgraded with armor where he is sent to make sure that nobody will understand Servo when he calls for help. * Thorned Virus - A pinkish-colored plant/dinosauric monster with leaf veins patterned throughout its body. It shot white powder from its mouth. Servo and Tanker in Drago battled with it in \\"Out of Sight, Out of Time.\\" In \\"My Virus Ate My Homework,\\" it was formerly introduced where Kilokhan wanted to send it into the nuclear missiles. When Malcolm was against this plot, Kilokhan brought it to life before Malcolm could delete it. Servo entered the internet through Sydney's laptop. As Tanker controlled Drago, he helped Servo fight the Thorned Virus. Servo was able to destroy the Thorned Virus and the missile was averted. * Krono - A diamond-backed dinosauric Mega-Virus monster. Krono can shoot a blue beam from its mouth. In its first appearance in \\"Out of Sight, Out of Time,\\" Malcolm created Krono and had Kilokhan send it into an atomic clock in England to render time in the world meaningless. Upon learning this, Sam became Servo to fight Krono. Sydney joined the battle in Vitor and was hit by Krono's attack. Tanker and Amp joined the battle and helped to form Synchro. He was destroyed by Synchro's Grid Power Punch. In \\"To Sleep Perchance To Scream,\\" he was sent into the tracking satellite that the Navy sent up. Servo (as Synchro) destroyed him again, but it turned out that it was only the first in a series of nightmares Sam would have throughout the episode. In \\"Syber-Dunk,\\" Krono creates a barrier that prevents Team Samurai and basketball star Charles \\"High Jump\\" Johnson from leaving the school when the latter had a basketball game to play in that night. With the unlikely help of High Jump (who was forced to board Borr), Synchro destroyed Krono again with his Grid Power. * Plexton - A dinosauric fire virus. He appeared several different times. He first appeared in \\"Some Like it Scalding\\" where Kilokhan sent him into the school's thermostat to make the temperature scorching hot. Servo fought him in a hot battle until Sydney creates the Samurai Sword and a shield for Servo to use. After Servo beheads and betails Plexton, Malcolm prepared a backup disk so Kilokhan can withdraw Plexton from battle. He later appeared in \\"The Cold Shoulder\\" alongside his sister Gramm and battled Servo. Servo tricked the two monsters into attacking each other causing them to turn against each other and it seemed that Plexton had the upper hand in their sibling rivalry. They were taken down by Servo's sword (which was powered up by his Grid Power) while the two monsters were distracted. In \\"Rock 'n' Roll Virucide,\\" Servo fought Plexton and Gramm again. Servo defeats them with the same tactic. He then appeared with an armor upgrade and went inside Sam's blow dryer in the episode \\"Hair I Stand, Hand to Hand.\\" With the aid of Sydney and Tanker (who were in the vehicles Jamb and Torb), Servo was able to knock him out this time with his main Grid Power Punch. Servo met him once more in \\"Hide and Servo\\" when Kilokhan chose him among Malcolm's drawings to see which Mega- Virus Monster will combat Servo after he is uncontrollably thrusted throughout cyberspace. After the battle, Plexton once again retreated (Plexton seemingly lost a portion of his tail while retreating). * Chronic - A virus made from chromium alloy with a bladed left arm and a pincerlike right arm. On its chest was a red jewel that unleashed a barrier when attacked by beam weapons. First appearing in \\"Money For Nothin' and Bits for Free,\\" Chronic tapped into the city's bank accounts making Malcolm rich. Servo then engages Chronic. After Tanker goes in and helps to get Servo unpinned from Chronic while destroying its red jewel, Servo destroyed it. In \\"Romeo and Joule-Watt,\\" Malcolm revamps Chronic and sends him into the school's stage lights during the school's play of Romeo and Juliet. In \\"It's Magic,\\" Chronic returned to disrupt Sam and Lucky London's magic show. * Skorn (voiced by Neil Ross) - A ninja-style virus. Deemed as perhaps the smartest of viruses, second-in-command to Kilokahn, and one of the only few who could actually speak. His combat skills were similar in technique to both a samurai and a ninja and were up to par with Servo's, and he wielded different weapons in battle, such as a sword, and a pair of nunchaku (which he also turned into a bo). Skorn also had the ability to create multiple clones of himself. Malcolm created him in \\"His Master's Voice\\" to send into the keyboard synthesizer to swap Sydney's voice with Tanker's voice. Sam transformed into Servo and fought Skorn. Tanker piloted Drago to help Servo. They formed Phormo and used its Lightning Grid Power to destroy Skorn. In \\"An Unhelping Hand,\\" Malcolm revived Skorn and has Kilokhan send him into Sydney's wristwatch and controlled her hand. Skorn used this to hinder the attempts of Servo's friends to help him. Eventually, with Tanker holding back Sydney's hand and Amp typing in the computer for Sydney, they managed to send Servo his shield and sword programs to help him when Skorn clones himself. He was killed by Servo when Servo launched his sword/shield directly through Skorn. In \\"The President's a Frink,\\" Malcolm uses him to fix the school presidential election. Here, he is destroyed again by Servo's shield/sword combo. In \\"Loose Lips Sink Microchips,\\" Malcolm revives Skorn and sends him into Sam's school radio show at school to reveal embarrassing secrets about people. Here, he is again destroyed by Phormo. * Kord - A giant reptilian monster with a camera-style eye, blinding floodlights built into his back, two tails, and is covered in magnetic plates. Kord had the ability to shoot fireballs of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius (as measured by Sydney) and could also make his shell super-heated, making physical contact with him dangerous. He could also restrain his opponents, leaving them vulnerable to his fireball attacks. He was responsible for trapping Sam inside a video camera in \\"Lights, Camera, Action.\\" Servo had the initiative early on but then got burned when touching Kord's high-temperature eye/camera. Kord proceeded to have Servo shackled where he was burned by Kord's fireballs. Eventually, with the help of Xenon, who smashed the virus's camera eye, Servo was able to defeat Kord with his Grid Power slicer, which he launched at the virus, slicing him up before turning orange and disintegrating. In \\"Little Ditch, Big Glitch,\\" Kord was later given some upgrades by Malcolm. This time, he had new black armor, no camera-style eye, and also had the ability to suck out Servo's main power. Servo was able to defeat him again with the Grid Power Punch after being aided in battle by Xenon. In \\"Give 'Til It Megahertz,\\" Malcolm resurrects the Kord virus in its upgraded form and uses him to turn the people of Earth into a bunch of overly generous people including Team Samurai. In \\"Lucky's Unlucky Adventure,\\" Kord is sent into Mrs. Starkey's cash register to make sure that the money comes up short enough to frame Lucky for the missing money. With help from Xenon, Servo destroys Kord with his Grid Power slicer. * Gramm - A dinosauric ice virus and the sister of Plexton. She was sent into Sam's air conditioner in \\"The Cold Shoulder\\" causing Sydney, Tanker and Amp to turn cold and against one another. She was destroyed when Servo thrust his sword through the gem on her chest, just moments after Servo wiped out Plexton in the fight. She later teamed up once again with her brother against Servo, but was again tricked into attacking each other, causing the two of them to fight. Servo then took this opportunity to destroy them with his sword. In \\"Rock 'n' Roll Virucide,\\" Servo fought Plexton and Gramm again. Servo defeats them with the same tactic. * Sucker Virus - A dinosauric virus with a large mouth (with coils built into it). In \\"Amp Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!,\\" the Sucker Virus was sent to suck in all the power from every nuclear power plant. In battle, he tried to suck Servo inside of him until Sydney rushed in with Borr and bailed him out. However, Sydney took some damage, but Tanker and Amp turned the tide by coming in on Tracto and Vitor, respectively. They all merged with Servo to create Synchro, who then proceeded to wipe out the virus with a Grid Power Punch. * Skeleton Virus - A Ceratopsian-headed dinosauric Mega-Virus monster. It had an armor that made him resemble a skeleton and he had something of a loud howl. While this virus was introduced in \\"Lights, Camera, Action\\", he had no formal introduction as the team fought him at the beginning of the episode. Plus, that battle was mirror-imaged. First appearing in \\"Amp Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!,\\" Kilokahn sent him to damage all the communication networks. The damage was shorting machinery circuits everywhere, jamming TV signals, and created an earthquake in the high school. Sam went into the digital realm as Servo to take this menace on. Servo had his way early on, but was sent reeling by fireballs that the virus shot from his mouth. Sydney sent Servo his Battle Shield to protect him from the fiery projectiles. The virus had another trick up his sleeve - he also had arrows built right into his armor, which he then proceeded to shoot right at Servo! Then, following another fireball attack, Servo's damage levels overloaded to the point that he was sent out of SyberSpace and the next second, Sam was back in his basement again! This time, Sam and Sydney, as well as Tanker and Amp, all went in to confront the virus again, and using Tracto, Borr and Vitor, they quickly merged with Servo to make the Synchro program. Synchro gave the virus a good thrashing, and neither the virus's fireballs nor arrows could faze Synchro. Synchro then used his Shoulder Drill Missile attack on the virus, and afterwards (in a move similar to the finisher that Phormo executed on Blink) finished off this virus by using the Grid Power Fire Stream from the gem on his chest. Servo later encountered this virus in the episode \\"Forget You!\\" where he was the cause of widespread amnesia in the real world and again came out the victor by using his Synchro powers. * Unnamed Virus #1 - This draconic virus was sent into the fortune-telling game in \\"Que Sera Servo\\" that would turn everyone into the opposite of what their future would be. While fighting a cowardly Servo (as a result of Sam becoming a coward because of the spell), he used a spell that turned Servo evil. When Xenon came in to attack the virus, he had the upper hand until Kilokahn intervened using his powers to throw Team Samurai back out of cyberspace. Amp (who had become a genius because of the effects of the virus) took one of Sydney's chains and smashed the game, with the shock caused in Syberspace rocking Servo and turning him good once again, turning the tide of the battle back in his favor. He then used a powerful Grid Power kick on the virus, which caused him to actually go right through, and ultimately destroy, the virus. * Hock - One of the deadliest viruses drawn by Malcolm and brought to life by Kilokhan. This green aardvark/dinosauric virus had tough armor and was armed with a pair of sword gauntlets on both arms. First appearing in \\"A Break in the Food Chain,\\" Malcolm and Kilokhan sent him into the food factories for the purpose of stopping shipments of food to the world that needs it. In battle, he was actually able to block Servo's Grid Power punch, but as the battle was turned back in Servo's favor (after Servo was able to strike him with his sword/Grid Power combination), the virus retreated. Servo took him on again in \\"Sweet and Sour Kilokahn\\" at the time when Sydney used a program that made Kilokahn good causing him to not bring Hock to life for Malcolm. When that was eliminated from Kilokhan, Servo fought Hock and the virus again retreated. He later reappeared in \\"The Taunt Heard Round the World\\" with some upgraded armor and was redubbed \\"The Hockinator\\". He had a target system in one eye and threw powerful boomerangs at Servo that would knock out at least 12% of his power per hit. After Sydney sent him the Dragon Cannon, Servo used it to turn the tide of the battle back in his favor, and then soon afterwards, Hock was finally eliminated by Servo's Grid Power. The normal Hock did appear again in the episode \\"Truant False\\", inside the school's computer, but was destroyed by an anti-virus system that appeared similar to Manfu. Then in the episode \\"What Rad Universe!\\", Sam, who was in an alternate dimension, became Servo with the help of Malcolm (who in that dimension was a nice guy and a computer whiz) to fight against the Hockinator once again (who was brought to life by Yolanda Pratchert instead of Malcolm Frink), and defeated him again with the Grid Power. * Sybo (voiced by Glen Beaudin in the first appearance) - When Kilokahn took over Malcolm's body in \\"Mal-Khan-Tent,\\" he stuck Malcolm inside this orange dinosauric virus (who still had Malcolm's voice) with six long spikelike appendages. He tried to break out of Syberspace but he was stopped by Servo and was destroyed by his Grid Power. After that Malcolm was back in his old body again. Some episodes later Servo fought and defeated this virus again (but obviously without Malcolm attached to him). In \\"Just Brown & Servo,\\" this virus was re-designed by Malcolm with some upgraded armor and a mace ball on both his tail and left hand. He was destroyed by the Grid Power of Synchro this time. In \\"Beep My, Beep My Baby,\\" Sybo is sent into Jennifer's pager to give off a hypnotic beep to maker her love Malcolm and not Sam. When Sybo assumes its upgraded form, Synchro defeats him in the same manner. * Troid - A blue Pterodactylus-style virus who had the ability to fly and attack from the air. Troid also had the ability to turn invisible while attacking, initially leaving Servo helpless to fight back until he summoned his computer's art program to help him, covering it in paint and leaving it visible. He first appeared inside Jennifer's Pom-Poms in \\"Ashes to Ashes, Disk to Disk,\\" causing whoever held them to be trapped inside SyberSpace where they were stored on floppy disks. After a battle with Servo, he retreated. Servo fought him again at the beginning of \\"My Virus Ate My Homework\\", and it was very much the same battle. Only this time, Servo destroyed him with his Grid Power Punch. * Unnamed Virus #2 - A robotic dinosauric virus used by Malcolm to knock out the world's electricity in \\"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend.\\" After an argument with Malcolm about who created the Internet, Kilokhan went behind Malcolm's back and brought this virus to life in order to have the world's electricity flow to him. Malcolm did not like this plan when he found out about it. Because of the power outage, Amp had to operate the exercise bike to provide power so that Sam can become Servo and fight this virus. With help from Tanker and Drago, Servo was able to defeat this virus with the Grid Power Punch and restore power to the world. In \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Virus,\\" Malcolm recreates this virus to alter the high school schedules so that he would be put in the same class as Jennifer. Like before, Servo and Drago defeated this virus. In \\"Pratchert's Radical Departure,\\" this virus is sent into Principal Pratchert's bullhorn to regress him back to his hippie days. * Sydney's Virus - As Kilokahn decided he no longer wanted Malcolm creating viruses for him in \\"Pride Goeth Before a Brawl,\\" he decided to enlist the aid of another computer user with that person being Sydney. He was able to coerce her to make a virus, which looked like nothing more than a peach- colored, timid creature (with a head actually found on her abdomen) who was not exactly evil and had a voice similar to Sydney's. Servo went in to face her, but the confused virus was not in a fighting mood and apologized for the rampage. Later, Kilokahn showed Malcolm what Sydney created, and Malcolm made the virus truly evil this time (giving her an upgrade in the form of a black, rhinocerotiform face), and Servo would struggle against her this time. Sydney, feeling responsible, offered to pilot Drago in Tanker's place (to which Tanker agreed) and combined Drago with Servo to bring in Phormo. Towards the end of the battle the virus tried to apologize again, but to no avail. She was eliminated by Phormo's Lightning Grid Power Punch. * Nightmare Virus - This stag beetle/dinosauric virus had a large shell, a mouth with several jagged teeth, and two long, powerful tentacles for arms. It briefly fought Servo in \\"An Un-helping Hand.\\" Sydney and Tanker boarded Tracto and Borr to help Servo. In \\"To Sleep, Perchance to Scream\\", the Nightmare Virus was sent into Sam's digital clock to give him numerous nightmares. When the morning seemingly came, and Sam's friends were able to find out where the virus is, it was destroyed by Servo with his Grid Power Punch with help from Jamb & Torb. After that, Sam woke up....it all seemed to be a dream. * Rock n' Roll Virus (voiced by Jess Harnell) - A musical delinquent-themed dinosauric virus responsible for turning Mrs. Starkey into a heavy rock and roll maniac in \\"Rock n' Roll Virucide.\\" * Smog Virus - This tall, black dinosauric virus had two tails from which he could emit deadly red smog. After a new floppy drive ate Malcolm's disk and nearly ate his hand (causing him to only be able to type with one hand), he used this virus to get revenge on the people of Tokyo, where the floppy drive was presumably made in \\"Born with a Jealous Mind.\\" The smog from the virus caused the residents of Tokyo to collapse everywhere in the streets. Sam told Tanker of this danger as he tried to convince Tanker to not be so jealous of the fact that Sydney was on a date with superstar Chad Williams. Sam then became Servo and went in to confront the virus. He had the upper-hand early on, but once the Smog Virus became too powerful for him - especially when he started using his smog against Servo - Tanker boarded Drago and went in to help his buddy. After he had Drago breathe fire at the virus, Tanker used Drago to merge with Servo and create the Phormo program. Phormo manhandled the virus and soon put him out with the Lightning Grid Power Punch. The Smog Virus was later seen in the episode \\"Do Not Reboot 'Til Christmas\\", where he was used to make all battery-powered toys explode at midnight on Christmas Eve. With the help of Phormo (piloted by Tanker), Servo was able to destroy him again, a split second before midnight. * Stupid Virus (voiced by Neil Ross) - A black dinosauric Mega-Virus similar to Skeleton who tampered with the national test scores at high school in \\"Cheater, Cheater, Megabyte Eater.\\" Its key power and weakness was its third eye, which was taken out by Servo after being pinned down by Xenon. Earlier in the battle, when Xenon fired its missile fists, the third eye was able to redirect the fists to hit Servo instead. In \\"Over the River and Through the Grid,\\" the Stupid Virus was sent to cut Mrs. Starkey's utilities making her unable to attend the annual Thanksgiving motorcycle trip with her friends as it was instructed to immobilize any electronic device within a certain radius. Servo and Xenon defeated it with the same tactic. * Manfu - A dark green hunchbacked Mega- Virus whose head is embedded in his abdomen, and on that head he had two horns from which he could emit blasts of electricity. This was one of Malcolm's deadliest viruses. Servo encountered him three different times. He first was sent into the school's water fountain in \\"Stiff as a Motherboard\\" and when Sam tried to drink from it, he became completely paralyzed, unable to move or speak. With the help of his friends, Sam was able to go into the computer and become Servo. In battle, Manfu trapped Servo (encasing him in computer chips from the waist down), and while Servo managed to hold back Manfu for some time with his shield and sword, it was not enough and it prompted the others to form Xenon to help Servo. However, Manfu proved to be too much for Xenon (first shooting off its arms and then finishing it off with a second blast, causing Sydney, Tanker and Amp to be thrust back out of Cyberspace and into the real world again). Servo then escaped by reflecting back the energy at him. He then broke off Manfu's horns, and then tossed him high in the air. While he was still spinning in the air, Servo eliminated him with his Grid Power Punch. In \\"Syberteria Combat,\\" Manfu created a barrier around the school at night. The battle went similarly, though this time Manfu took out Xenon in one blast, but Servo emerged victorious again. In \\"Truant False,\\" the school computer sent an anti-virus after Hock, which Malcolm used to try to alter his attendance records so he could skip summer school. After the anti-virus destroyed Hock, Malcolm decided to corrupt the anti-virus, modifying its look to make it look exactly like Manfu, and Servo went to battle it. Sydney reminded Servo that he could not destroy it since it was actually an anti- virus, and destroying it would crash the computer system. The anti-virus very nearly destroyed Servo, but Sydney was able to reprogram it just in time, turning it back into the anti-virus and making it good again. * Nixtor - A Hercules Beetle/dinosauric Mega-Virus used by Malcolm in \\"Water You Doing?\\" to turn the city's water supply into hydrochloric acid. He was brown in color, crawled on four legs, and had two pincerlike horns sticking out of his head. When Servo first encountered him, Nixtor made the ground below Servo melt, causing him to fall one level to where Nixtor was actually hiding. He then had Servo locked up in chains and caused deadly gas to spray at Servo. The gang prepared to aid Servo, but Tanker could not go in the end due to being sick in his stomach. Sydney and Amp boarded Borr and Vitor to aid Servo in battle. They freed him and helped turn the tide of the battle back in his favor. In the end Servo managed to win by wiping out the virus with his Grid Power Punch. This virus would be used again in \\"Tanks For the Memories\\" where he would be sent into Tanker's Walkman, completely messing with Tanker's personality by distracting him and making him say obscure quotes. The battle was the same as before, with Tanker's impairment keeping him from joining the battle this time. * Raedon - A Mega-Virus that resembles an armor upgraded version of Troid. Its wings can emit deadly lasers or be used to fly. In \\"Starkey in Syberspace,\\" Kilokahn and Malcolm realized that typically their monsters were stronger than Servo, but he managed to win because of the others providing back-up in their vehicles. Kilokahn created an Input/Output barrier so that the next time Servo went into Syberspace to battle Raedon, he would be cut off from the help of Team Samurai. However, Mrs. Starkey had accidentally transported herself into the digital world before the barrier was up when she mistook a picture of the Drago Jet on Sydney's laptop for a video game. Per Kilokahn's expectations, this virus proved to be super strong and almost had Servo beaten. However, Mrs. Starkey (who was obviously unaware of Servo's origins or identity) helped Servo out against the monster. After getting fired at a few times by the Starkey-piloted Drago Jet, Raedon was finally eliminated by Servo's Grid Power Punch. * Unnamed Virus #3 - This virus was not officially named on the show, but because he very much resembled a non-armored version of Krono. This version of him had a light bulb-like structure on his head. Upon reluctantly agreeing to save Malcolm from Mrs. Starkey (who was under the love spell that came from the music box that the virus was placed into) in \\"Love Me Don't,\\" Sam went in as Servo and made short work of the monster, tossing him about, breaking the light bulb on his head, and destroying him with his Grid Power. This was also the virus featured in \\"Take a Hike\\" where he was modified to knock out all the electricity in the world. As Sam was not present due to him being out of town, Tanker had to become Servo to take this virus on. He did and he manhandled the virus (Sydney remarked that Tanker fights viruses like he plays football) before destroying him with the Grid Power Punch. Arsenal programs =Zenon program= * Zenon: A powerful humanoid created when the Vitor, Tracto, and Borr programs combine. Its fists can execute a ranged rocket punch, as in the battle against Kord, which it almost defeats on its own.  Borr: An orange and black twin- drilled tank that can fly or burrow underground. Its driver is Sydney. Also, a famous basketball player - Charles \\"High Jump\\" Johnson - is dragged along to fight a Mega-Virus monster as a temporary driver for Borr when the band use the vehicles to escape the locked high school (in \\"Syber-Dunk\\"). Borr forms either Synchro's gauntlets and shoulder armor or Zenon's lower torso and upper legs.  Tracto: A blue laser-equipped mini-tank. Its driver is Tanker. Tracto forms either Synchro's boots or Zenon's legs.  Vitor: A red fighter jet armed with lasers, missiles, and a rig to restrain monsters. Its pilot is Amp and later Lucky. On one occasion it is piloted by Sydney, who has trouble flying it. Vitor forms either Synchro's helmet and body armor or Zenon's head, arms, and upper. In an odd occurrence, Zenon fights Servo in \\"Que Sera Servo\\" when a Mega-Virus places Servo under a spell which has him obey solely Kilokahn, until Amp is able to break the virus' hold by using Syd's belt to reboot him. When Borr, Tracto, and Vitor combine with Servo, they form Servo's upgrade known as Synchro, which is armed with a pair of shoulder drill missiles. =Drago program= * Drago: A wingless dragon assembled when Jamb and Torb combine. It is piloted by almost always Tanker and occasionally Sydney. Later in the series, Jamb and Torb would just appear as one single jet fighter that is piloted by either Sydney or Tanker and eventually just transforms into Drago. Neither Amp or Lucky pilot Drago during the series' run. While Tanker and Syd are the default pilots for the \\"Drago Jet\\", Mrs. Starkey did act as the pilot in \\"Starkey in Syberspace\\".  Jamb: A dragon- head-shaped mini-jet which also is the bazooka-like flamethrower Dragon Cannon that is used by Servo. Its main pilot is Sydney.  Torb: A jet with various weaponry. Its main pilot is Tanker. When Drago combines with Servo, they form Servo's second upgrade known as Phormo, which is armed with a pair of laser gauntlets. Battle cries =Main characters= *Sam: \\"Let's Samuraize, guys!\\" *Sydney: \\"Pump up the power!\\" *Tanker: \\"Let's kick some Giga-Butt!\\" *Lucky: \\"Surf's up!\\" *Amp usually has a random battle cry every episode he \\"samurized\\", such as these examples: \\"Two for a Dollar!\\", \\"Three for a Dollar!\\", \\"With a Cherry on Top!\\" Episodes for most of the series' run, Brad Kreisberg has been the director of several entries while most of the episodes are written by Jymn Magon & Mark Zaslove - any differences regarding who wrote or directed the episodes is minimal and varies: { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#92000a; color:#fff;\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#92000a; color:#fff;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#92000a; color:#fff;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#92000a; color:#fff;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#92000a; color:#fff;\\" Original air date } Home media release In 1995, Buena Vista Home Video (under the DIC Toon Time Video label) released the series on three two-episode VHS cassettes. On February 19, 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment releases the series' first DVD volume in Region 1 for the very first time. The 3-disc set features the first 28 episodes of the series. On October 1 in that year, Mill Creek releases the second DVD volume which features the remaining 25 episodes. Online distribution Recently, five episodes (new episodes were added and old episodes were removed on Wednesdays) were available on Jaroo, which was an online video site then operated by Cookie Jar Entertainment with which DIC later merges. In or after 2013, Cookie Jar was taken over by DHX Media. The Jaroo site closes as a result, but DHX Media mentions that it planned to re-locate the site, and its shows, for online distribution. As of February 2016, the series could be streamed through the Pluto TV app on the \\"After School Cartoons\\" channel 370.

Toth's work began in the American comic book industry, but he is also known for his animation designs for Hanna- Barbera throughout the 1960s and 1970s. His work included Super Friends, Fantastic Four, Space Ghost, Sealab 2020, The Herculoids and Birdman. Toth's work has been resurrected in the late-night, adult-themed spin-offs on Cartoon Network: Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Sealab 2021 and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. He was inducted into the comic book industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990. Biography =Early life and career= Alex Toth was born in 1928 to immigrants from Hungary, who were part of the Slovak minority in Hungary. His father was Sandor Toth, a musician, his mother was Mary Elizabeth. Toth's talent was noticed early, and a teacher from his poster class in junior high school urged him to devote himself to art. Enrolling in the School of Industrial Art, Toth studied illustration. He began his career when he sold his first freelance art at the age of 15, subsequently illustrating true stories for Heroic magazine through a comic book packager named Steve Douglas. Although he initially aimed to do newspaper strips (\\"It was my dream to do what Caniff, Raymond, and Foster had done\\"), he found the industry \\"dying\\" and instead moved into comic books. After graduating from the School of Industrial Art in 1947, Toth was hired by Sheldon Mayer at National/DC Comics. Green Lantern #28 (Oct.‚ÄìNov. 1947) was one of the first comics he drew for the company. He drew four issues of All Star Comics including issues #38 and #41 in which the Black Canary first met the Justice Society of America and then joined the team.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 57: \\"In a sign of the character's growing popularity, Black Canary made her first appearance outside of Flash Comics in a feature by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Alex Toth...By the story's end, Black Canary was considered for JSA membership but wouldn't officially join until All Star Comics #41.\\" A canine sidekick for Green Lantern named Streak was introduced in Green Lantern #30 (Feb.‚ÄìMarch 1948) and the dog proved so popular that he became the featured character on several covers of the series starting with #34.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 59: \\"The debut of Streak the Wonder Dog in a story by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Alex Toth wasn't a good sign for Green Lantern...Streak took over the cover of issue #34 in September, but he couldn't save his master's series from cancelation the following year.\\" He worked at DC for five years, drawing the Golden Age versions of the Flash, Doctor Mid-Nite, and the Atom. In addition to superheroes, Toth drew Western comics for DC including All-Star Western.Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 66: \\"With work by artists Gil Kane, Carmine Infantino, and Alex Toth, and writer Robert Kanigher, among others, All-Star Western would run for ten years as a bimonthly title.\\" He was assigned to the \\"Johnny Thunder\\" feature in All-Star Western because editor Julius Schwartz considered him to be \\"my best artist at the time.\\" Toth and writer Robert Kanigher co-created Rex the Wonder Dog in 1952.Irvine \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 68: \\"Rex the Wonder Dog leaped into comics with his own bimonthly series...written by Robert Kanigher and [drawn by] Alex Toth.\\" For a brief time in 1950, Toth was able to realize his dream of working on newspaper comic strips by ghost illustrating Casey Ruggles with Warren Tufts. In 1952 Toth ended his contract with DC Comics and moved to California. It is during that time that he worked on crime, war and romance comics for Standard Comics. In 1954, Toth was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan, he wrote and drew his own weekly adventure strip, Jon Fury, for the base paper, Depot Diary. =Animation and later career= Space Ghost, one of Toth's most famous designs. Returning to the United States in 1956, Toth settled in the Los Angeles area and worked primarily for Dell Comics until 1960. In that year, Toth became art director for the Space Angel animated science fiction show. This led to his being hired by Hanna-Barbera, where he created the character Space Ghost for the animated series of the same name. His other creations include The Herculoids, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and Dino Boy in the Lost Valley. He worked as a storyboard and design artist until 1968 and then again in 1973 when he was assigned to Australia for five months to produce the TV series Super Friends. He continued to work in comic books, contributing to Warren Publishing's magazines Eerie, Creepy and The Rook. For DC Comics, he drew the first issue of The Witching Hour (February‚ÄìMarch 1969) and introduced the series' three witches.McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 132: \\"For the first issue, writer/artist Alex Toth provided a framing sequence...that introduced readers to cronish Mordred, motherly Mildred, and beautiful maiden Cynthia.\\" Toth illustrated the comic book tie-in to the Hot Wheels animated series based on the toy line.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 138: \\"Toth's aerodynamic storytelling fueled a series that took licensed tie- ins in a bold new direction.\\" His collaboration with writer Bob Haney on the four page story \\"Dirty Job\\" in Our Army at War #241 (Feb. 1972), has been described as a \\"true masterpiece\\". Toth worked with writer/editor Archie Goodwin on the story \\"Burma Sky\\" in Our Fighting Forces #146 (Dec. 1973‚ÄìJan. 1974) and Goodwin praised Toth's art in a 1998 interview: \\"To me, having Alex Toth do any kind of airplane story, it's a joy for me. If I see a chance to do something like that, I will. He did a really fabulous job on it.\\" The two men crafted a Batman story for Detective Comics #442 (Aug.-Sept. 1974) as well. Toth and E. Nelson Bridwell produced a framing sequence for the Super Friends feature in Limited Collectors' Edition #C-41 (Dec 1975‚ÄìJan. 1976). Toth's final work for DC was the cover for Batman Black and White #4 (Sept. 1996).Levitz \\"The Dark Age 1984‚Äì1998\\" p. 574: \\"Only fate understood the juxtaposition of having the first cover [to the series] be Jim Lee's debut as a DC contributor and the last be Alex Toth's final contribution, placing the star artist of DC's next decades against the artist's artist of its Golden and Silver ages.\\" =Death= Toth died at his drawing table on May 27, 2006 from a heart attack. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. =Personal life= Alex Toth was the father of four children, sons Eric and Damon and daughters Dana and Carrie. His marriage to Christina Schraber Hyde ended in divorce in 1968 and his second wife Guyla Avery died in 1985. Legacy Toth did much of his comics work outside superhero comics, concentrating instead on such subjects as hot rod racing, romance, horror, and action-adventure. His work on Disney's Zorro has been reprinted in trade paperback form several times. Also, there are two volumes of The Alex Toth Reader, published by Pure Imagination, which focuses on his work for Standard Comics and Western Publishing. Brian Bolland has cited Toth as one of his idols. Journalist Tom Spurgeon wrote that Toth possessed \\"an almost transcendent understanding of the power of art as a visual story component\\", and called him \\"one of the handful of people who could seriously enter into Greatest Comic Book Artist of All-Time discussions\\" and \\"a giant of 20th-century cartoon design\\". Toth was known for his exhaustive study of other artists and his outspoken analysis of comics art past and present. For example, in a 2001 interview he criticized the trend of fully painted comics, saying \\"It could be comics if those who know how to paint also knew how to tell a story! Who knew what pacing was, and didn't just jam a lot of pretty pictures together into a page, pages, and call it a story, continuity! It ain't!\\" Toth lamented what he saw as a lack of awareness on the part of younger artists of their predecessors, as well as a feeling that the innocent fun of comics' past was being lost in the pursuit of pointless nihilism and mature content. In the 1990s and 2000s, he contributed to the magazines Comic Book Artist and Alter Ego, writing the columns \\"Before I Forget\\" and \\"Who Cares? I Do!\\", respectively. In 2006, James Counts and Billy Ingram compiled personal anecdotes, hundreds of unseen sketches from famous Alex Toth comic and animated works combined with correspondence with friend and comics dealer John Hitchcock in the book Dear John: The Alex Toth Doodle Book (Octopus Press). Launched at ComicCon 2006, the first printing sold out within weeks of first publication. Film director Michael Almereyda has stated that Toth was a formative influence on his youth, and credits his lifelong interest in Nikola Tesla as the initial catalyst for Almereyda's Tesla biopic.

United Kingdom Regimental quartermaster sergeant is an appointment held by a warrant officer class 2 in the British Army and Royal Marines. The RQMS is the senior assistant to the quartermaster of a regiment or battalion and also usually functions as the deputy regimental sergeant major. Some units have more than one. RQMS was a separate rank until 1915, when it became a warrant officer appointment with the creation of the rank of warrant officer class II. In the Household Cavalry, the appointment is instead regimental quartermaster corporal.

Patterson was also named a Baseball America second-team selection after his junior season. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= Patterson was selected by the Chicago Cubs as the third overall pick in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut in 1999 with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class-A Midwest League, and was selected as that league's \\"Prospect of the Year\\" after leading the league in slugging percentage (.592), extra base hits (72) and triples (17). He also batted .320 with 20 homers and 79 RBI, and was named to the league's all-star team both at mid-season and postseason. Baseball America named Patterson the league's top prospect. After the 1999 season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was that league's youngest player. He batted .368 with 4 home runs, 24 RBI, and 8 stolen bases in 35 games, and was named to the league's all-star team. In 2000, Patterson was promoted to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League. He was named to the league's mid-season and postseason all-star team, and was named the league's top prospect by Baseball America. Patterson batted .268 with 22 home runs and 82 RBI, finishing second in the league in home runs. After playing in the 2000 Southern League playoffs, Patterson was called up from the minors to play for the Cubs. He made his Major League debut on September 18, 2000, against the Milwaukee Brewers. The next day Patterson recorded his first Major League hit, a home run off Juan Acevedo. He finished the 2000 season with seven hits in 42 at bats, and two home runs. Patterson did not start playing a full season until 2002, when he finished with a .253 batting average. In 2003, he batted .298 with 55 RBI in only 83 games before suffering a torn ACL while running to first on a base hit against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 6. The injury ended Patterson's 2003 campaign.https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/07/08/Knee-injury-ends-season- for-Patterson/32651057662928/ Patterson played 157 games in 2004, with a .266 batting average, 24 home runs, and 72 RBI in 631 at-bats. His on-base plus slugging of .771, while only average, is his best of the six seasons in which he played more than 83 games. He had the lowest range factor (2.18) among all starting Major League center fielders in 2004. In the 2005 season Patterson did not do well. On July 7, he was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. The demotion came after the Cubs had lost a season-high eight games in a row. Published reports indicated that center fielder F√©lix Pie, the Cubs' top prospect, was slated to be called up from Double-A West Tenn in July when Patterson was sent down. Patterson was back up with the Major League team on August 9, after his one-month stint in Triple-A Iowa. Patterson batting for the Baltimore Orioles in 2007. =Baltimore Orioles= Patterson was traded by the Cubs to the Orioles on January 9, 2006, for Class-A Minor league players Nate Spears and Carlos Perez. On February 10, 2007 Patterson signed a 1-year deal worth $4.3 million to avoid arbitration.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2760715 In his first of two years with the Orioles, he batted .276 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI. He also stole 45 bases, which ranked third in the American League. Patterson's contract was not renewed after the 2007 season. =Cincinnati Reds= On March 3, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds signed Patterson to a minor league contract. At the end of Spring training, he was added to the 40-man roster. Dusty Baker, manager of the Reds and Patterson's manager in Chicago, was instrumental in signing Patterson. Baker often voiced his opinion on Patterson saying he thought Patterson is still a developing player. Patterson was invited to the Reds' spring training camp, and he started the 2008 season in center field for Cincinnati. Platooning with utility man Ryan Freel, Patterson began the season well. Gradually his average deteriorated, culminating in an 0‚Äì8 performance during Cincinnati's 18-inning loss to San Diego on May 25. The following day top outfield prospect Jay Bruce was called up from the Triple-A Louisville Bats to start in center field, demoting Patterson to the Reds' bench. On May 28, Patterson accepted a reassignment to Triple-A Louisville.Patterson accepts demotion to minors The demotion lasted only one week, however, when Patterson was recalled to replace Ryan Freel, who went to the disabled list with a strained right hamstring on June 4. Patterson ended the season with a .205 batting average and .238 OBP. =Washington Nationals= On December 18, 2008, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals. Due to Josh Willingham being placed on the bereavement list, Patterson had his contract purchased from the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs on June 13, 2009. He hit .302, with six home runs and 23 RBIs in a 39 games with the Chiefs, but hit only .133 with 2 stolen bases in 5 games for the Nationals. He was reassigned to Triple-A on June 20, 2009. He was released by the Nationals on July 29, 2009. =Milwaukee Brewers= Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on August 1, 2009.http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2009/08/brewers-sign-corey- patterson.html Patterson hit well with the AAA affiliate Nashville Sound, batting .331 with a .963 OPS over 29 games and 124 at-bats. However, he struggled with the parent club, where his BA, OBP, and SLG were all .071 over 11 games and 14 at-bats.http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/P/corey- patterson.shtml =Seattle Mariners= Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 9, 2009. However, he opted out of his contract on March 31, 2010 after being informed he had not made the Major League team.Mariners announce Spring Training roster move =Return to Baltimore= On April 21, 2010, Corey agreed to re-join the Orioles on a 1-year minor league deal. He was promoted to the Orioles on May 12, 2010 On July 9, 2010, Patterson hit his first career grand slam against the Texas Rangers. It was a remarkable feat as Patterson faced the season's eventual saves leader and rookie of the year in the hard throwing Neftal√≠ Feliz, with a 2‚Äì2 count and two outs in the top of the 9th inning representing the tying run. Patterson drilled his pitch over the right field fence to tie the game at 6. Jake Fox hit a solo homer in the top of the 10th for the game winner. =Toronto Blue Jays= Patterson with the Toronto Blue Jays On December 21, 2010, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He began the season on the Major League roster, but on the disabled list because of a head injury. Patterson made his regular season debut as a Blue Jay on April 11, 2011 against the Seattle Mariners, hitting a home run and finishing the night 2‚Äì4 with 2 RBI =St. Louis Cardinals= On July 27, 2011, Patterson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Edwin Jackson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet. =Return to Milwaukee= On January 30, 2012, Patterson signed a minor league contract to return to the Brewers organization. He played 117 games for Nashville Sounds, the AAA team of the Brewers, batting .251 with 39 RBI in 390 plate appearances. For the first season since his Major League debut, he did not play in the Major Leagues. =New York Mets= He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in February 2013.

In reality the action was brought by Factortame Limited against the Secretary of State. was a judicial review case taken against the United Kingdom government by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached European Union law by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK. The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law. The litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages: *Factortame I, where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the European Court of Justice on the legality of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988's (\\"MSA\\") requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75% UK owned. After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law, Factortame saw the House of Lords confirm the supremacy of EU law over national law in the areas where the EU has competence because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties.The House of Lords judgment is referred to as R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 2) [1991] 1 AC 603. *Factortame II, where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law. *Factortame III, where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law. *Factortame IV, where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the Francovich v Italy(1990) C-6/90 principle, that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss (also known as the doctrine of state liability). *Factortame V, holding that claims after 1996 were statute-barred, since claims against a member state were like other claims in tort under the Limitation Act 1980. Facts The EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all member states and introducing structural funds to ensure modernisation of the sector. In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their exclusive economic zone, which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985, which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on fishing stocks led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of \\"total allowable catches\\" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the British Fishing Boats Act 1983 (BFBA). In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen. From 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy fishing vessel registration requirements contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as \\"quota hopping\\". In order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked preliminary questions to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG ‚Äì see Agegate (C-3/87, ) and Jaderow (C-216/87, ). In 1988 the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had \\"a genuine and substantial connection\\" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any charterer, manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A \\"qualified person or company\\" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, \\"qualified persons\\". As from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for judicial review was brought by its owners in the Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in December 1988. Factortame I Factortame Ltd sought, first, a preliminary injunction declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to directly effective rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the Treaty of Rome), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43‚Äì48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the Secretary of State from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased. HMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries. In the event this assertion proved false. =High Court= On 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court (Neill LJ and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: European Union law). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of English law and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the status quo ante. HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the Court of Appeal. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson MR, Bingham LJ and Mann LJ) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged \\"to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right\\". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had \\"acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established\\". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ. =House of Lords= The case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the House of Lords (Lord Bridge, Lord Brandon, Lord Oliver, Lord Goff and Lord Jauncey) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an Act of Parliament. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have \\"conferred upon them rights directly contrary to Parliament's sovereign will\\". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown. Nevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts \\"against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law\\" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law. =European Court of Justice= The action was lodged at the ECJ on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame. Advocate-General Tesauro argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 (). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in Simmenthal (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not \\"be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect\\" (case 61/79, Denkavit, ). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate- General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights. On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as \\"full court\\" of 11 justices) en banc gave its ruling,bailii.org: 1st ECJ decision in re Factortame. Tesauro, AG; David Vaughan, Gerald Barling, David Anderson, and Stephen Swabey for the Applicant; Timothy J G Pratt, Sir Nicholas Lyell, Christopher Bellamy, Christopher Vajda for the Respondent; as well as the state of Ireland, the European Commission, and Rawlings Trawling Ltd. rephrasing the question posed as \\"whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\\". Following the Advocate- General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ. =Back to the House of Lords= On 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on parliamentary sovereignty. Lord Goff acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the Senior Courts Act 1981). In deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had \\"considerable force\\". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law. Addressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, Lord Bridge remarked that such comments were \\"based on a misconception\\", and that under the European Communities Act 1972, the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had \\"always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law\\". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU directives, the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies. These commentsLord Bridge [1991] 1 AC 603, 658; quoted in were perceived by Sir William Wade as \\"revolutionary\\", in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed. Such an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in Thoburn v Sunderland City Council and Hunt v Hackney Borough Council to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and \\"statutory\\" or \\"constitutional\\" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in Thoburn.) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972. Furthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by Lord Diplock in the case of Garland v British Rail Engineering). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of Macarthys v Smith, Lord Denning suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European. Factortame II compatibility On 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court,, 2nd ECJ decision in re Factortame. David Vaughan, Gerald Barling, David Anderson, and Stephen Swabey for the Applicant, Timothy J.G. Pratt, Sir Nicholas Lyell, Christopher Bellamy, Christopher Vajda, and Andrew Macnab for the Respondent, and six national governments plus the European Commission. Opinion Advocate-General: namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General Mischo's opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that \\"it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law\\". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality. In the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as \\"the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]\\". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law. The UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the Common Fisheries Policy allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a \\"real economic link\\" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to \\"concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries\\". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions. Factortame III state liability Following the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the German Federal Court had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of Brasserie du P√™cheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined. At this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in Francovich (), which established the principle that \\"a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law\\". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to \\"the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States\\". In its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996,, Joined Cases C-46/93 and C-48/93: Brasserie du P√™cheur SA v Federal Republic of Germany; and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd and Others\\" 5 Mar 1996. Tesauro, AG; 6 other EU member state governments; the European Commission, 8 lawyers for 97 Claimants, and J.E. Collins, Stephen Richards, Christopher Vajda and Rhodri Thompson for the Respondent. the court of nine justices en banc reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question. The court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are: # the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals; # the breach must be sufficiently serious; # there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation and the damage sustained by the injured party. In the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be \\"sufficiently serious\\" it must be \\"manifest\\" and \\"grave\\". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance. Factortame IV right to damages The matter came back to the Divisional Court (Hobhouse LJ, Collins J and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for exemplary damages. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Schiemann LJ and Walker LJ) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998. HMG appealed again to the House of Lords (Lord Slynn, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope). The House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined. In March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed ¬£285 million, received ¬£55 million including interest of some ¬£26 million. Factortame V limitation issues On 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the Technology and Construction Court (a division of the High Court) held, under the Limitation Act 1980, Factortame's claims against the UK government were \\"actions founded on tort\\", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996. The judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the Race Relations Act 1976. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem. Significance The Factortame case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by Dicey. Sir William Wade argues that the Factortame judgment alters the Rule of Recognition. The issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice had ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which applied to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. Prior to Brexit (31 January 2020), the UK recognised the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in Macarthys Ltd v Smith, Lord Denning MR said, \\"If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act‚Äîwith the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it‚Äîor intentionally of acting inconsistently with it‚Äîand says so in express terms‚Äîthen ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament.\\"Lord Denning in Macarthys Ltd v Smith [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in This view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by Lord Justice Laws in the Thoburn v Sunderland City Council case, when he said that \\"there is nothing in the European Communities Act which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions.\\" That European law had primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 Costa v ENEL (1964), the ECJ stated that \\"the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields\\". In Case 26/62 Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (1963) their ruling states that \\"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights\\". The question of who has the ultimate kompetenz-kompetenz (i.e. the right to decide the limits of jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice) has not been settled.

Livestock market in Mali. Pastoralism is a form of animal husbandry where domesticated animals known as livestock are released onto large vegetated outdoor lands (pastures) for grazing, historically by nomadic people who moved around with their herds. The species involved include cattle, camels, goats, yaks, llamas, reindeer, horse and sheep. Pastoralism is found in many variations throughout the world, generally where environmental characteristics such as aridity, poor soils, cold or hot temperature, and lack of water make crop growing difficult or impossible. Operating in these more extreme environments with more marginal lands, mean that pastoral communities are very vulnerable to global warming. Pastoralism remains a way of life in many geographies including Africa, the Tibetan plateau, the Eurasian steppes, the Andes, Patagonia, the Pampas, Australia and many other places. As of 2019, 200-500 million people practise pastoralism globally, and 75% of all countries have pastoral communities. Pastoral communities have different levels of mobility. Sedentary pastoralism is becoming more common as the hardening of political borders, land tenures, expansion of crop farming, and construction of fences and dedicated agricultural buildings all reduce the ability to move livestocks around freely, leading to the rise of pastoral farming on established grazing zones called ranches. Sedentary pastoralists might also raise crops and livestocks together in the form of mixed farming, for the purpose of diversifying productivity, obtaining manure for organic farming, and improve pasture conditions for their livestock. Mobile pastoralism includes moving herds locally across short distances in search of fresh forage and water, something that can occur daily or even within a few hours; to transhumance, where animals are routinely moved between different seasonal pastures across regions; to nomadism, where pastoralists and families move with the animals in search for any available grazing grounds without much long-term planning. Grazing in woodlands and forests may be referred to as silvopastoralism. Pastoralist herds interact with their environment, and mediate human relations with the environment as a way of turning uncultivated plants like wild grass into food. In many places, grazing herds on savannas and woodlands can help maintain the biodiversity of the savannas and prevent them from evolving into dense shrublands or forests. Grazing and browsing at the appropriate levels often can increase biodiversity in Mediterranean climate regions. Pastoralists shape ecosystems in different ways: some communities use fire to make ecosystems more suitable for grazing and browsing animals. Origins Khoikhoi dismantling their huts, preparing to move to new pastures. Aquatint by Samuel Daniell (1805). One theory is that pastoralism was created from mixed farming. Bates and Lees proposed that it was the incorporation of irrigation into farming which ensued in specialization. Advantages of mixed farming include reducing risk of failure, spreading labour, and re-utilizing resources. The importance of these advantages and disadvantages to different farmers differs according to the sociocultural preferences of the farmers and the biophysical conditions as determined by rainfall, radiation, soil type, and disease. The increased productivity of irrigation agriculture led to an increase in population and an added impact on resources. Bordering areas of land remained in use for animal breeding. This meant that large distances had to be covered by herds to collect sufficient forage. Specialization occurred as a result of the increasing importance of both intensive agriculture and pastoralism. Both agriculture and pastoralism developed alongside each other, with continuous interactions. There is another theory that suggests pastoralism evolved from hunting and gathering. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility and the needs of the animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by taming and domesticating them. Hunter-gatherers' strategies in the past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environment conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping big game and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering wild plant foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts. These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism. Resources Pastoralism occurs in uncultivated areas. Wild animals eat the forage from the marginal lands and humans survive from milk, blood, and often meat of the herds and often trade by-products like wool and milk for money and food.Bates, 1998:105 Pastoralists do not exist at basic subsistence. Pastoralists often compile wealth and participate in international trade. Pastoralists have trade relations with agriculturalists, horticulturalists, and other groups. Pastoralists are not extensively dependent on milk, blood, and meat of their herd. McCabe noted that when common property institutions are created, in long-lived communities, resource sustainability is much higher, which is evident in the East African grasslands of pastoralist populations. However, it needs to be noted that the property rights structure is only one of the many different parameters that affect the sustainability of resources, and common or private property per se, does not necessarily lead to sustainability. Global map of pastoralism, origins and spread, from Some pastoralists supplement herding with hunting and gathering, fishing and/or small-scale farming or pastoral farming. =Mobility= Mongol pastoralist in the Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province Mobility allows pastoralists to adapt to the environment, which opens up the possibility for both fertile and infertile regions to support human existence. Important components of pastoralism include low population density, mobility, vitality, and intricate information systems. The system is transformed to fit the environment rather than adjusting the environment to support the \\"food production system.\\"(Bates, 1998:104) Mobile pastoralists can often cover a radius of a hundred to five hundred kilometers. Pastoralists and their livestock have impacted the environment. Lands long used for pastoralism have transformed under the forces of grazing livestock and anthropogenic fire. Fire was a method of revitalizing pastureland and preventing forest regrowth. The collective environmental weights of fire and livestock browsing have transformed landscapes in many parts of the world. Fire has permitted pastoralists to tend the land for their livestock. Political boundaries are based on environmental boundaries. The Maquis shrublands of the Mediterranean region are dominated by pyrophytic plants that thrive under conditions of anthropogenic fire and livestock grazing.Pyne, Stephen J. (1997) Vestal Fire: An Environmental History, Told through Fire, of Europe and Europe's Encounter with the World. Seattle and London: University of Washington Press. Nomadic pastoralists have a global food-producing strategy depending on the management of herd animals for meat, skin, wool, milk, blood, manure, and transport. Nomadic pastoralism is practiced in different climates and environments with daily movement and seasonal migration. Pastoralists are among the most flexible populations. Pastoralist societies have had field armed men protect their livestock and their people and then to return into a disorganized pattern of foraging. The products of the herd animals are the most important resources, although the use of other resources, including domesticated and wild plants, hunted animals, and goods accessible in a market economy are not excluded. The boundaries between states impact the viability of subsistence and trade relations with cultivators. Pastoralist strategies typify effective adaptation to the environment.Fagan, B. (1999) \\"Drought Follows the Plow\\", Chapter 11 of Floods, Famines and Emperors: Basic Books. Precipitation differences are evaluated by pastoralists. In East Africa, different animals are taken to specific regions throughout the year that corresponds to the seasonal patterns of precipitation.Giulio Angioni (1989) I pascoli erranti: Liguori Transhumance is the seasonal migration of livestock and pastoralists between higher and lower pastures. Some pastoralists are constantly moving, which may put them at odds with sedentary people of towns and cities. The resulting conflicts can result in war for disputed lands. These disputes are recorded in ancient times in the Middle East, as well as for East Asia. Other pastoralists are able to remain in the same location which results in longer-standing housing. Camel market in Sudan Different mobility patterns can be observed: Somali pastoralists keep their animals in one of the harshest environments but they have evolved of the centuries. Somalis have well developed pastoral culture where complete system of life and governance has been refined. Somali poetry depicts humans interactions, pastoral animals, beasts on the prowl, and other natural things such the rain, celestial events and historic events of significance. Mobility was an important strategy for the Ariaal; however with the loss of grazing land impacted by the growth in population, severe drought, the expansion of agriculture, and the expansion of commercial ranches and game parks, mobility was lost. The poorest families were driven out of pastoralism and into towns to take jobs. Few Ariaal families benefited from education, healthcare, and income earning. The flexibility of pastoralists to respond to environmental change was reduced by colonization. For example, mobility was limited in the Sahel region of Africa with settlement being encouraged. The population tripled and sanitation and medical treatment were improved. The Afar pastoralists in Ethiopia uses an indigenous communication method called dagu for information. This helps them in getting crucial information about climate and availability of pastures at various locations. =Information= Pastoralists have mental maps of the value of specific environments at different times of year. Pastoralists have an understanding of ecological processes and the environment. Information sharing is vital for creating knowledge through the networks of linked societies. Pastoralists produce food in the world's harshest environments, and pastoral production supports the livelihoods of rural populations on almost half of the world's land. Several hundred million people are pastoralists, mostly in Africa and Asia. ReliefWeb reported that \\"Several hundred million people practice pastoralism‚Äîthe use of extensive grazing on rangelands for livestock production, in over 100 countries worldwide. The African Union estimated that Africa has about 268 million pastoralists‚Äîover a quarter of the total population‚Äîliving on about 43 percent of the continent‚Äôs total land mass.\\" Pastoralists manage rangelands covering about a third of the Earth's terrestrial surface and are able to produce food where crop production is not possible. Nenets reindeer herders in Russia Pastoralism has been shown, \\"based on a review of many studies, to be between 2 and 10 times more productive per unit of land than the capital intensive alternatives that have been put forward\\". However, many of these benefits go unmeasured and are frequently squandered by policies and investments that seek to replace pastoralism with more capital intensive modes of production. They have traditionally suffered from poor understanding, marginalization and exclusion from dialogue. The Pastoralist Knowledge Hub, managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN serves as a knowledge repository on technical excellence on pastoralism as well as \\"a neutral forum for exchange and alliance building among pastoralists and stakeholders working on pastoralist issues\\".FAO, 2016. The Pastoralist Knowledge Hub. http://www.fao.org/pastoralist-knowledge-hub/background/why-a- hub/en/ retrieved Nov. 2016  Pastoralism and farm animal genetic resource  There is a variation in genetic makeup of the farm animals driven mainly by natural and human based selection. For example, pastoralists in large parts of Sub Saharan Africa are preferring livestock breeds which are adapted to their environment and able to tolerate drought and diseases. However, in other animal production systems these breeds are discouraged and more productive exotic ones are favored. This situation could not be left unaddressed due to the changes in market preferences and climate all over the world, which could lead to changes in livestock diseases occurrence and decline forage quality and availability. Hence pastoralists can maintain farm animal genetic resources by conserving local livestock breeds. Generally conserving farm animal genetic resources under pastoralism is advantageous in terms of reliability and associated cost. =Tragedy of the commons= Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons (1968) described how common property resources, such as the land shared by pastoralists, eventually become overused and ruined. According to Hardin's paper, the pastoralist land use strategy suffered criticisms of being unstable and a cause of environmental degradation. Tuareg pastoralists and their herds flee south into Nigeria from Niger during the 2005‚Äì06 Niger food crisis However, one of Hardin's conditions for a \\"tragedy of the commons\\" is that people can't communicate with each other or make agreements and contracts. Many scholars have pointed out that this is ridiculous, and yet it is applied in development projects around the globe, motivating the destruction of community and other governance systems that have managed sustainable pastoral systems for thousands of years. The outcomes have often been disastrous. In her book Governing the Commons, Elinor Ostrom showed that communities were not trapped and helpless amid diminishing commons. She argued that a Common-pool resource, such as grazing lands used for pastoralism, can be managed more sustainably through community groups and cooperatives than through privatization or total governmental control. Ostrom was awarded a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her work. Pastoralists in the Sahel zone in Africa were held responsible for the depletion of resources. The depletion of resources was actually triggered by a prior interference and punitive climate conditions. Hardin's paper suggests a solution to the problems, offering a coherent basis for privatization of land, which stimulates the transfer of land from tribal peoples to the state or to individuals. The privatized programs impact the livelihood of the pastoralist societies while weakening the environment. Settlement programs often serve the needs of the state in reducing the autonomy and livelihoods of pastoral people. The violent herder‚Äìfarmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan, Ethiopia and other countries in the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions have been exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and population growth. However, recently it has been shown that pastoralism supports human existence in harsh environments and often represents a sustainable approach to land use.

He was a director of William Brandt's insurance brokers and became a member of Lloyds in 1965. Political career Edwards left insurance to take Desmond Donnelly's old seat of Pembroke and served as Secretary of State for Wales in Margaret Thatcher's first and second administrations. He was adopted by the Pembrokeshire Conservative Party as parliamentary candidate for Pembroke in 1968. At the 1970 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire, which he represented until his retirement at the 1987 general election. From 1975 to 1979, he was Opposition Spokesman for Welsh Affairs (in other words, the Shadow Secretary of State for Wales). When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, Edwards was appointed Secretary of State for Wales. He served in that position until 1987, when he was given a life peerage, being created on 15 October 1987 as Baron Crickhowell, of Pont Esgob in the Black Mountains and County of Powys. Later career Lord Crickhowell was the sole chairman of the National Rivers Authority (NRA) from its inception in 1989 until its merger into the newly created Environment Agency in 1996. Although his was a direct political appointment from the Conservative government, Lord Crickhowell showed commitment to the principles of the NRA and the legislation that it enforced. He spoke in favour of the natural environment and supporting strong enforcement action against major corporate polluters. During the 1990s, Lord Crickhowell became a leading figure in the campaign for a permanent home for the Welsh National Opera in Cardiff. When the plans were rejected by the Government in 1995, he launched a public attack on his former Conservative colleagues. Lord Crickhowell sat in the House of Lords as a life peer for over 30 years from 1987 until his death in 2018, making his last appearance in September 2017. He had been associated with many British institutions, including the University of Wales, Cardiff (now Cardiff University), where he was awarded an honorary fellowship in 1984 and served as president from 1988 to 1998. He received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Glamorgan in 2001. Death He died on 17 March 2018 at the age of 84.

History  GPA was based in Shannon, Ireland. During the 1980s it became the world's largest commercial aircraft lessor and expanded its shareholding to include Air Canada, General Electric, Short Term Credit Bank of Japan and companies in the Mitsubishi group. GPA also had financing joint ventures with key aircraft manufactures, including Airbus, Fokker and McDonnell Douglas. At its peak, the company was valued at $4 bn. Net income reached $265 mn in the year to 31 March 1992. Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, former British chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, Peter Sutherland and the former Chairman of ICI, Sir John Harvey-Jones, were among GPA's non-executive directors. Lawson joined the board of GPA in February 1990 but he also became chairman of GPA Financial, a subsidiary company. In 1990, GPA stunned the aviation world by placing a $17 billion order for 700 new aircraft over the following decade. A new company, GPA Helicopters Ltd., was set up in June 1990 as a joint venture with CHC Helicopter to acquire, own and lease helicopters worldwide. = Downfall = The decision to float the company on the stock market in 1992, during an aviation industry downturn following the 1991 Gulf War, proved disastrous, as international financial institutions refused to buy shares. Unable to raise the capital it needed to continue its ambitious operations, the company plunged into crisis, with some $10 billion in debts. The story of GPA's downfall is told by Christopher Brown, aviation lawyer and GPA Senior Vice-President, in his 2009 book Crash Landing ‚Äì An Inside Account of the Fall of GPA. The book is a personal memoir of the history, background and run-in to the failed initial public offering (share flotation), GPA's subsequent financial collapse and later restructuring and involvement of GE Capital (GECAS). It is based on a contemporaneous diary of events kept by the author from 1990 to 1996 while employed by GPA and subsequently GECAS. = Restructuring = In a subsequent restructuring completed in November 1993, GPA avoided default on its debts by selling some of its aircraft to a subsidiary of General Electric, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), which also took over the operational management of GPA's fleet and most of GPA's technical and marketing staff. GE Capital also acquired an option to purchase 90% of GPA's ordinary shares at a low price. GPA used the cash from this transaction to repay all its unsecured debt. Chairman and chief executive Tony Ryan transferred to GECAS. He was replaced by Patrick Blaney as chief executive and by Dennis Stevenson (later Lord Stevenson of Coddenham) as chairman. GPA continued to own a substantial fleet and in March 1996 sold 229 aircraft for $4 bn in what was at the time the second largest securitisation transaction ever. GPA used the cash from this sale to repay all of its secured debt and the company returned to profit in the year to 31 March 1996 with net income of $65 mn. GPA further consolidated its position in the years to 31 March 1997, 1998 and 1999, reporting net income of $108 mn, $64 mn and $47 mn. In November 1998, Texas Pacific Group acquired 62% of the company's shares and GE Capital's 1993 option was replaced by one to acquire an interest of 23%. As part of this transaction, the name of the company was changed to AerFi Group plc. In December 1999, AerFi acquired Indigo Aviation, a Swedish aircraft lessor, and by 31 March 2000 was managing a fleet of 104 aircraft and reporting a profit of $68 mn. In November 2000, AerFi was acquired by debis AirFinance, an affiliate of DaimlerChrysler AG, for $750 mn. AerFi's fleet and staff were then merged into those of debis AirFinance. In March 2005, debis AirFinance was acquired by Cerberus Capital and subsequently renamed AerCap.  Legacy  Many of the directors and staff of GPA subsequently went on to found or work for other aircraft lessors, such as GECAS, Genesis Lease, CIT, AerCap (a successor to Guinness Peat and previously debisAirFinance), ILFC (now merged into AerCap), Pembroke Capital, International Aircraft Management Group (subsequently RBS Aviation Capital and later SMBC Aviation Capital), Babcock & Brown (now Fly Leasing) and Aircastle. The availability of this cadre of highly trained specialists in Ireland is one of the principal reasons (along with a favourable corporate tax environment associated with the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin) why the country has become one of the worldwide centres of the commercial aircraft financing and leasing industry, with over 40 companies, most located in the IFSC. GPA's founder, Tony Ryan, set up his own airline, Ryanair, that was Europe's biggest in 2014, carrying over 83.8 mn passengers annually.  Sponsorship  During the Ethiopian famine, GPA sponsored two airlifts of emergency supplies in October and November 1984. A number of other, mainly artistic endeavours benefited from sponsorship by GPA that included the following: In 1988 the first GPA Dublin International Piano Competition took place and was won by French pianist Philippe Cassard. In 1984 Robert Armstrong won the Guinness Peat Aviation Awards for Emerging Artists and in 1986 Eithne Jordan won during the show held in Dublin. One of the exhibitors was Vincent Killowry and in 1987 GPA bought most of the works at his first one-man show in Limerick. In 1989 John Banville received the Guinness Peat Aviation Book Award for his novel The Book of Evidence, also shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction. Also in 1989 the Foynes Flying boat Museum , at its inception, was sponsored as the GPA Foynes Flying Boat Museum.

The parish's population was recorded as 8,517 in the 2001 census. The name is not derived from \\"oak\\" or \\"gates\\" but is derived from the Ancient Brythonic name for the valley which was Usc-con, meaning The Lake(Usc(water) and the confluence(Cond) of two streams (see Cartlidge), and from the Old Norse gata, path; see gh- in Indo-European roots. meaning boundary or Road. So Usc-con gait is at the Road at the vale of Usc-con. A history of Oakengates was written by local historian Reverend J.E.G. Cartlidge whose name is commemorated in the name of the retirement home Cartlidge House. The Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton railway line runs through the town and there is a station and a tunnel (Oakengates Tunnel). Oakengates was also served by the Coalport Branch Line and had a second station called Oakengates Market Street railway station which closed in 1952. It is now Station Hill with only the goods shed still standing. In the late 18th century the Ketley Canal was constructed to carry coal and ironstone from Oakengates to Ketley works. The canal has long since fallen into disuse and little trace of it can be found today. The first boat lift in Britain was an experimental one built at Oakengates in 1794 by Robert Weldon of Lichfield. A full-scale version was to be built on the Somerset Coal Canal at Rowley Bottom near Combe Hay, but the lift jammed and failed while being demonstrated and the construction was abandoned. The town had a considerable manufacturing sector well into the c20 and one of the products of this can still be seen at the Museum of Power in Langford, Essex. This has, still in working order, what is believed to be the last steam engine built and installed by the Lilleshall Company Ltd. It was commissioned on 13 January 1931. Shadrach Fox ran the Wombridge Iron Works in Oakengates and with Abraham Darby was involved in experiments on methods of producing pig iron in a blast furnace fuelled by coke rather than charcoal. This was a major step forward in the production of iron as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution . In 1701 he placed his brother in charge of the blast furnace, at Wombridge to which Isaac Hawkins supplied a large quantity of coal and ironstone, which suggests that they already smelted iron with coke there - a major technological breakthrough which is now solely commemorated at nearby Coalbrookdale. Ferrous metallurgy Oakengates has Telford's main theatre. Nearby are the town council's headquarters and the United Reformed/Methodist church. The town has a growing reputation as offering an \\"all year real ale festival\\". It has three pubs in the CAMRA guide (2015) more than many towns very much greater in size. These are the Crown Inn, The Old Fighting Cocks and The Station Inn which are all within a few feet of each other and collectively offer a wide range of real ales, principally from smaller breweries. Over 20 can typically be found at any one time and special beer festivals at the individual pubs can expand this range even further at certain times of year.  Urban District Council  Before the formation of the District of The Wrekin (Telford) and later the Borough of Telford and The Wrekin, the Urban District of Oakengates comprised Oakengates, Wrockwardine Wood, St. George's, Priorslee, Snedshill, The Nabb, Wombridge and Trench, and always had a Labour council.

Worrell is a fictional character, portrayed by Jim Varney in a series of television commercials and later in a television series (Hey Vern, It's Ernest!) as well as a series of feature films. Ernest was based on the Andy Griffith Show character Ernest T. Bass and created with Varney by the Nashville advertising agency Carden & Cherry and was used in various local television ad campaigns. The only national products he promoted were The Coca- Cola Company's sodas, Chex, and Taco John's. The first Ernest commercial, filmed in 1980, advertised an appearance by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders at Beech Bend Park, an amusement park near Bowling Green, Kentucky. The format of the commercials seldom varied, most often scripted to be comedic and fast- paced. The rubber-faced Ernest, almost always dressed in a denim vest and baseball cap, appeared at the door of an unseen, unheard, and seemingly unwilling neighbor named Vern. The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be \\"Vern\\", as Varney looked directly in the camera whenever Vern was addressed. Ernest's seemingly pointless conversations with Vern ‚Äì which were actually a monologue due to Vern never responding ‚Äì inevitably rambled around to a favorable description of the sponsor's product, followed by his signature close, \\"KnowhutImean?\\" While Vern is never shown to say anything, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest due to him trying to slam his door in Ernest's face on a few occasions. Vern also shakes his head \\"No\\" whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Ernest, despite having good intentions, is utterly oblivious to Vern's apparent distress regarding him and always regards Vern as his closest buddy and confidant. History The Ernest ads were shot with a handheld film camera at the Nashville-area home of producer John Cherry III and Jerry Carden, beginning in 1980. As their number of clients increased, Varney sometimes did upwards of 25 different versions of a spot in a single day. Producer Coke Sams stated that Varney had a photographic memory and would read through the script one time then insert the various products' names on different takes. The commercials and the character had definite impact; children especially seemed to imitate Ernest and \\"KnoWhutimean?\\" became a catchphrase. Carden & Cherry had begun receiving requests from major national companies to use Ernest, but were largely unable to agree to most of them because of conflicts with the exclusive rights local companies received when they had requested Ernest commercials. Carden & Cherry responded by transitioning the character to film and television. Ernest's first feature-film appearance was as one of Varney's numerous characters in the science fiction horror spoof Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, which introduced several supporting actors who would reappear throughout the Ernest franchise, including Bill Byrge, Myke R. Mueller, and Jackie Welch. A Saturday morning sketch comedy series, Hey Vern, It's Ernest!, followed shortly thereafter, which won Varney a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance. A series of five feature-length comedies starred Ernest between 1987 and 1993, followed by four more direct-to-video entries; all nine were directed by either John Cherry or Coke Sams. The movies were not critically well-received; however, they were produced on very low budgets and were quite profitable. In the films, Ernest is apparently somewhat aware of his extreme resistance to harm, as in Ernest Rides Again, he seemed barely fazed by nails bending after being fired at his skull, remarking \\"Good thing they hit the hard end\\", he also commented that he would be dead \\"If I wasn't this close to being an actual cartoon.\\" To allow Varney to act out his numerous other characters, Ernest is portrayed as a master of disguise, able to pose as one of any number of relatives to get out of a predicament. He also is impervious to electrocution, instead becoming a powerful electromagnet (among other surreal side effects) when hit with a large shock: this is a major plot device in Ernest Goes to Jail and also appears in Ernest Rides Again. In his Ernest role, Varney appeared in dozens of Cerritos Auto Square commercials for many years on Los Angeles area television stations; he also appeared in commercials for Audubon Chrysler Center in Henderson, Kentucky, John L. Sullivan auto dealerships in the Sacramento, California area, the Pontiac, Michigan-based electronics store ABC Warehouse, and the Oklahoma City-based Braum's Ice Cream and Dairy Store. In the Southeast, the Ernest character was the spokesman for Purity milk. In New Mexico, he appeared in commercials for Blake's Lotaburger. In northern Virginia Ernest appeared a series of commercials for Tyson's Toyota. In Houston, he did commercials promoting Channel 2 News KPRC-TV. In 2005, five years after Varney's death, the Ernest P. Worrell character returned in new commercials as a CGI cartoon, created by an animation company called face2face and produced by Ernest originators Carden & Cherry. Ernest was voiced by John C. Hudgens, an advertising and broadcast producer from Little Rock, Arkansas, who also played an Ernest type character in some regional live action commercials. Family Ernest has a large family made up of people with similar traits to him, all of whom were portrayed by Jim Varney. Varney, as Worrell, mentioned that his family was from Kentucky (Varney's real-life birthplace) when he hosted Happy New Year, America on CBS December 31, 1988. Most of Worrell's family members had their appearance in either Hey Vern, It's My Family Album, Your World as I See It, or Varney's stand-up routine. ;Edna Worrell :Ernest's wife according to the television commercials and Hey Vern, It's My Family Album. According to Ernest, Edna makes a great deep dish pie. Her middle initial is also said to be P. in Ernest's newsletter during the 1980s. In the film series, Ernest has become a confirmed bachelor, living alone with his dog. ;Ace Worrell :A fighter pilot who served in the army. His relation to Ernest is unknown though he is believed to be a great uncle. ;Astor Clement :Ernest's uncle, a wealthy college professor who likes to brag about his rich status and unusual intelligence and was the main narrator of Your World As I See It. Astor was also one of Ernest's disguises in Ernest Saves Christmas. ;Bunny Jeannette Rogers :The slow-witted and confused sister of Ernest who runs her own quirky hair salon called \\"Bunny's Beauty World.\\" Her beautifying tactics often involve painful torture for her clients. ;Lloyd Rowe :Ernest's great uncle, a mean-spirited, impoverished Appalachian mountain man. He was Ernest's disguise as \\"The Snake Guy\\" in Ernest Saves Christmas. Lloyd was one of Varney's stand- up characters before the creation of Ernest; he was originally conceived as the Appalachian answer to a mountaintop guru with an obese wife named Ruth and an even more massive, indestructible eight-year-old son named Mistake. ;Auntie Nelda :Ernest's elderly, sarcastic and dramatic great-aunt. She regularly complains about her son Izzy not visiting enough, noting that her other son Hymie had always treated her well but died. Her late husband Morris was cremated and she still harangues his ashes. She tries to get men to notice her by acting innocent all the time. One of Varney's most frequent characters, Auntie Nelda was one of Ernest's \\"multiple personalities\\" in Ernest Scared Stupid and one of his disguises in Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest Goes to Jail, Ernest Rides Again, and Ernest Goes to Africa. Auntie Nelda was also used as one of Dr. Otto's disguises in Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam and was a regular segment on Hey Vern, It's Ernest! ;Coy Worrell :Ernest's redneck brother who is stuck in a 1950s rockabilly mindset and runs a store that sells car parts. He is a Bears fan, has virtually no thoughts on any substantive issues (shrugging his shoulders and responding \\"dunno\\" whenever asked) is quite proud of the tattoo collection on his body. Coy has been married at least twice: first to Rayette Worrell and then to Anita Worrell. ;Billy \\"Boogie\\" Worrell :Ernest's cousin, a carny who operates the Scrambler at an amusement park, speaks to his patrons in rhyming jive, and dances to a disco beat. While he frequently makes passes at attractive female patrons, he is in fact a married man with a teenage son and speaks with a normal voice outside of work. ;Davy Worrell :Ernest's light-headed great, great uncle who was a war veteran in the late 19th century. He helped his army troop win a battle against a Native American tribe led by Chief Running Vern, even though his troop was not even present at the time. He is a spoof of frontiersman Davy Crockett. ;Rhetch Worrell :Ernest's great, great-grandfather who was popular with women and had a girlfriend named Verna. He was a heavy gambler and incredibly stupid. ;Pa Worrell :Ernest's elderly father, a World War II veteran who has a politically incorrect view of the world. His first name is never revealed. He is an avid fisherman and is friends with an African savage named Qui Qua. ;Ma Worrell :Ernest's elderly mother. She is known to be a good cook and according to Ernest she used to make a great chocolate milk, which is Ernest's favorite drink. ;Reverend Phineas Worrell :A distant English-born ancestor of Ernest in \\"Ernest Scared Stupid\\". He helped banish a troll named Trantor, who Ernest accidentally released several generations later. Phineas was unique among the known Worrell family in that he appeared to have a relatively serious disposition and appeared to be quite intelligent for the brief moment that he was shown. However, as Trantor was being banished, the troll placed a curse on the Worrell family that would make members of the family considerably less intelligent with each successive generation, ultimately culminating in a member of the family that would release Trantor. ;Stephani P. Worrell :Ernest's aunt from the television series. She had thick glasses and cried a lot. ;Ernie P. Worrell :Ernest's son. Only mentioned once by Ernest while answering fan mail in his own newsletter. (In the films and commercials, Ernest is usually portrayed as a confirmed bachelor with no children.) ;Dingus Worrell :A potato, who Ernest says came over during the potato famine and went on to become a yam magnate. Pets Ernest also had several pets during the course of his career. They are listed below in order of appearance. ;Shorty :Ernest's first dog. She appeared in several commercials usually having given birth to a litter of puppies in the back of Vern's new pick up truck while out driving with Ernest. Shorty's exact breed is unknown as she was portrayed by a different breed in each of her appearances. In the Hey Vern, It's Ernest episode \\"Hey Vern, It's Magic\\", Shorty was a male and Vern's dog. He was portrayed by a Border Collie on the show. ;Pokey :A Box Turtle that Ernest had adopted from \\"actual nature\\" in Ernest Goes to Camp. Pokey and his family were used as \\"turtle paratroopers\\" during the battle with the miners toward the end of the movie. ;Ants :In Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest mentions that he once had an ant farm. ;Rover :Ernest's second dog. Ernest's pursuit of Rover was the subject of a Hey Vern, It's Ernest! episode. Ernest spent the episode saving up to buy Rover but Vern ended up buying him first only to give him to Ernest at the end. ;Rimshot :Ernest's third dog, a male Jack Russell Terrier. Rimshot is Ernest's best known pet. He is characterized as very smart. He was featured in two of the movies, Ernest Goes to Jail and Ernest Scared Stupid, in which he was also shown to be very brave and tough, as he would stand up to the main villains which would usually lead to his near demise. ;Jake :Ernest's Fantail (goldfish) in Ernest Goes to Africa. Sadly, Jake died when Ernest accidentally broke his fish bowl and then dropped him into the kitchen garbage disposal and mistakenly hit the wrong switch.

Coke Sams said in 2011 that Ernest Spaced Out may have gotten as far as a film treatment. Sams said about the film, \\"I believe that was kind of a Lost in Space epic. It seems like there were astronauts and maybe a space capsule.\\" Sams said a script had been written for Ernest and the Voodoo Curse: \\"We went back to the Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein kind of thing. It had a really bad guy and happened on an island like Hawaii. [‚Ä¶] So we had Voodoo and a high priest. It was like the idiot version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. We had lines of zombies, Voodoo potions, and Ernest pretending to be a zombie. Ernest and the Voodoo Curse actually was pretty funny. There was a woman in it, who had one blue eye and one brown eye. She was supposed to be the woman of Ernest's dreams. Of course, she would have nothing to do with him.\\" By 2003, Jim Varney's IMDb biography page stated that he had died before he could finish filming a tenth Ernest film, titled Ernest the Pirate, which had been stated to be scheduled for release in 2000. In November 2011, Sams said the film never existed. Varney had actually been in consideration for a role in the 1999 film, Pirates of the Plain. Parodies Ernest has been parodied in numerous television series, including Beavis and Butt-Head, Family Guy and The Simpsons. Some of the \\"fake\\" Ernest films from The Simpsons include Ernest Needs A Kidney, Ernest vs. the Pope, Ernest goes to Broadway, Ernest Goes Straight to Video, and Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap (footage from Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap was shown in the episode Cape Feare, in which Ernest is seen in a public library with Vern and gets his head stuck in a toilet). In the Family Guy episode \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", Peter remembers the time he went to Blockbuster two minutes before closing and was forced to choose between Ernest Goes to the Beach and Ernest Doesn't Go to the Beach. In the Beavis and Butt-Head episode \\"At the Movies,\\" the boys are watching Ernest at the drive-in. Ernest is inside the Statue of Liberty and comes across a door with a sign that reads \\"DO NOT ENTER.\\" However, Ernest misreads it as \\"donut entry\\" and opens the door, falling through the statue's nose. Other TV shows that have referenced the Ernest movies include ALF, Saved by the Bell, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Kenan & Kel, The Nanny, How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, Teen Titans Go, and many more. Commercials on home video Most of Ernest's commercials were released on VHS tapes from Disney's Touchstone Pictures, and Hollywood Pictures Home Video. Many are also available on DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment and Image Entertainment. Merchandise A comedic paperback book titled \\"Hey, Vern! It's the Ernest P. Worrell Book of Knowledge\\" was published by Camden & Cherry in 1985, which was re-released with the title \\"It's the Ernest P. Worrell Book of Knawledge\\" (sic) in 1986. It was followed by the book \\"Ask Ernest: What, When, Where, Why, Who Cares?\\", published by Rutledge Hill Press in 1993. Both books were designed as if Ernest had created his own homemade zine, featuring a varied collection of jokes, puns, musings, and art. A 16\\" Ernest talking doll based on the TV series Hey Vern, It's Ernest! was produced by Kenner in 1989. Reboot In October 2012, a film reboot was announced, tentatively titled Son of Ernest. As suggested by the title the film will focus on Ernest's long lost son, presumably Ernie P. Worrell as mentioned above. No update had been given ever since.

She has been a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba legislature since 1986, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1999. She also served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in 2000, following Filmon's resignation. Early life and history Born Bonnie Bester, the daughter of Henry Bester and Millie Leslie, she was educated at the Health Sciences Centre School of Nursing and practiced as a Registered Nurse. In 1969, she married Don Mitchelson, who has been a politician, having served as a city councillor in Winnipeg. Political career She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1986, defeating incumbent New Democrat Phil Eyler in the northeast Winnipeg riding of River East. She was re-elected by a wider margin in 1988, as Filmon's Tories won a minority government. On May 9, 1988, Mitchelson was appointed Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation (later renamed Culture, Heritage and Citizenship), with responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act. On February 5, 1991, she was also named Minister of Multiculturalism with responsibility for Status of Women. As Minister of Culture, Mitchelson made the controversial decision to establish a review commission for Manitoba's arts policy that was made up entirely of non- artists. After a cabinet shuffle on September 10, 1993, she was named Minister of Family Services, and retained the position until the Filmon government was defeated in 1999. Prior to the election of 1999, she proposed a series of workfare measures as part of a policy of welfare reform. Mitchelson was re- elected by a comfortable margin in 1990, and again in 1995 and 1999. She was chosen as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party on May 29, 2000, and held the position until Stuart Murray was acclaimed as party leader in November. She was then named as the party's Deputy Leader. To date, she is the only woman to lead the Manitoba Progressive Conservative party, and only the third female party leader in Manitoba's history. In the general election of 2003, Mitchelson defeated New Democrat Doug Longstaffe, 4,935 votes to 4,402. She was the only Progressive Conservative MLA to hold a seat in the north of Winnipeg. She was a supporter of Hugh McFadyen's campaign to succeed Stuart Murray as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, and was narrowly re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

The population of Donnington Ward within the mentioned borough was 6,883 at the 2011 Census. Aside from the rest of urban Telford, which is to the southwest, History Before the Romans arrived in Britain the area around Donnington was a mixture of forest and open rough ground in some respects more suitable to sheep rather than humans. Further down Donnington's low lying valley, north of Donnington, the ground was marshy wetland habitat; today this has been drained for farming. This wet moorland provided protection for pre-Roman Celts living between 300BC and 100AD near the hill fort at the now small settlement of Wall North of Donnington. The original Donnington village was to the northeast of the current centre of Donnington. A map of Shropshire from 1610 refers to Donnington as Dunnyton, the ending ington meaning in Anglo Saxon Dunny's homestead or farm. This farm was most likely leased from the Saxon Minster of St Alkmund's Shrewsbury who when the Normans arrived held the land around Lilleshall (according to the Domesday Survey (1086)). Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 the land was eventually passed to Godbald, religious adviser to the Norman magnate Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury; Godbald descendants, the Belmeis family, endowed the land in 1145 to the Christian Augustinian foundation from North East France who built Lilleshall Abbey. Over 400 years later the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII ended centuries of church dominated society and the land was purchased in 1539 by James Leveson, a Wolverhampton wool merchant and was then passed down his family's inheritance to eventually become part of the Duke of Sutherland's estate. Leveson's descendants over the centuries invested heavily in draining the sodden moors to the north of Donnington so they could be farmed and in mining coal from the Donnington wood coalfield. Locals, mostly men, would have found work in these enterprises and at the local farms. By the early 20th century Donnington was a minor industrial centre where \\"Walker's works\\" (C&W; Walker Ltd) iron works produced components of gasometers and ship's engines. The Clock Tower restaurant commemorates the landmark Walker's Clock which now sits on a road island near where \\"Walker's works\\" once was. This roundabout is just a hundred metres north from the centre of the original village of Donnington. Walker's Clock's distinctive audible blast called the workers living in Donnington and nearby to work and was a time keeper for every one else. At the same location there was, as shown on an Ordnance Survey from 1833, Donnington railway station with freight and passenger connections to Wellington and Stafford; this was closed as part of Beeching cuts in 1964. Only further north, at The Humbers, iron-making is thought to have taken place since the late 16th Century, with the name 'Humbers' deriving from a set of water-driven ‚Äòhammers‚Äô which in 1580 were owned by the Duke of Sutherland ancestors (whose Lilleshall Ironworks was one of the first blast furnaces in the West Midlands). The Hammers were located on or near the site of a mill on Lubstree Pool, which before the dissolution of the monasteries had belonged to the Canons of the nearby Lilleshall Abbey. At the original Donnington village centre there was a coal wharf linked by rail to the Granville Colliery, Shropshire's last deep coal mine. This mine tapped into the Donnington Wood coalfield (where most of the local coal and ironstone reserves are located and which once came to the surface where it was mined in the 18th Century at Donnington Wood). In 1818 the Lilleshall Company began sinking a number of deep mines around Donnington Wood, extracting over 400,000 tons of coal a year from the area by 1871. This industrial heritage links the original Donnington village to the Industrial Revolution that Telford proudly asserts began with the first large scale smelting of iron using coke in the Coalbrookdale area of Telford. The current centre of Donnington, near the Parade (as in the photo here), is actually the centre of a planned village initially called New Donnington, a housing development that began in the late 1930s when the War Office bought land to house the workers who would be employed at the Donnington Army Ordnance Depot, which was established in 1936 and remains in use as a logistics base. The new planned town of Telford that includes Donnington was a separate planned development begun in 1963. Today Donnington is a ward of Telford with a long parade of shops down the high street. In the 21st Century this has grown with an Asda superstore and an Aldi supermarket added to the Co-op supermarket that already existed. Additionally a Home Bargains supermarket has replaced the Netto store)supermarket then Netto replaced Morrison‚Äôs supermarket in the centre of Donnington on the site of the old pub \\"The Champion Jockey\\". The Telford International Railfreight Park has been recently developed on a site formerly part of the MoD depot, given rail access by rebuilding of the former Shropshire Union Railway west towards Wellington. It is expected this development will attract more light industry to the industrial estates near Donnington.

It is a type of zone electrophoresis usually performed on proteins in a gel that takes advantage of the fact that overall charge on the molecule of interest is a function of the pH of its surroundings. Procedure IEF involves adding an ampholyte solution into immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels. IPGs are the acrylamide gel matrix co-polymerized with the pH gradient, which result in completely stable gradients except the most alkaline (>12) pH values. The immobilized pH gradient is obtained by the continuous change in the ratio of immobilines. An immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value. A protein that is in a pH region below its isoelectric point (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate toward the cathode (negatively charged electrode). As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein's overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction toward either electrode). As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands. Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by aliphatic ampholytes). An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a \\"positive\\" anode and \\"negative\\" cathode end. Negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the \\"positive\\" end while positively charged molecules move toward the \\"negative\\" end. As a particle moves toward the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached. At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as polyampholytes with varying pI values to electrophoresis. The method is applied particularly often in the study of proteins, which separate based on their relative content of acidic and basic residues, whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an Immobilized pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch, or agarose where a pH gradient has been established. Gels with large pores are usually used in this process to eliminate any \\"sieving\\" effects, or artifacts in the pI caused by differing migration rates for proteins of differing sizes. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in pI value by as little as 0.01.Stryer, Lubert: \\"Biochemie\\", page 50. Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 1996 (German) Isoelectric focusing is the first step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which proteins are first separated by their pI value and then further separated by molecular weight through SDS- PAGE. Living cells According to some opinions, living eukaryotic cells perform isoelectric focusing of proteins in their interior to overcome a limitation of the rate of metabolic reaction by diffusion of enzymes and their reactants, and to regulate the rate of particular biochemical processes. By concentrating the enzymes of particular metabolic pathways into distinct and small regions of its interior, the cell can increase the rate of particular biochemical pathways by several orders of magnitude. By modification of the isoelectric point (pI) of molecules of an enzyme by, e.g., phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, the cell can transfer molecules of the enzyme between different parts of its interior, to switch on or switch off particular biochemical processes. Microfluidic chip based Microchip based electrophoresis is a promising alternative to capillary electrophoresis since it has the potential to provide rapid protein analysis, straightforward integration with other microfluidic unit operations, whole channel detection, nitrocellulose films, smaller sample sizes and lower fabrication costs. Multi-junction The increased demand for faster and easy-to-use protein separation tools has accelerated the evolution of IEF towards in-solution separations. In this context, a multi-junction IEF system was developed to perform fast and gel-free IEF separations. The multi-junction IEF system utilizes a series of vessels with a capillary passing through each vessel. Part of the capillary in each vessel is replaced by a semipermeable membrane. The vessels contain buffer solutions with different pH values, so that a pH gradient is effectively established inside the capillary. The buffer solution in each vessel has an electrical contact with a voltage divider connected to a high-voltage power supply, which established electrical field along the capillary. When a sample (a mixture of peptides or proteins) is injected in the capillary, the presence of the electrical field and the pH gradient separates these molecules according to their isoelectric points. The multi- junction IEF system has been used to separate tryptic peptide mixtures for two-dimensional proteomics and blood plasma proteins from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients for biomarker discovery.

The park‚Äôs museum exhibits and interpretive features share the story of the citrus industry's role in the history and development of Southern California, and is told through the experiences of the diverse migrant and immigrant groups who made it all possible. The California Citrus State Historic Park is in the city of Riverside in Riverside County, California, United States. The park was established in 1993. This California State Historic Park reveals the cultural, political, and environmental aspects of the time when \\"Citrus was King\\" in California, especially the Navel orange from Riverside, and recognizing the importance of the citrus industry in Southern California. History In 1873, Riverside resident Eliza Tibbets planted two orange trees from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The success of these trees launched the orange industry in the area. Open-air museum and visitor center An orange grove in California The design of the park is reminiscent of a 1900s city park, complete with an activity center, interpretive structure, amphitheater, picnic area, and demonstration groves of citrus tree orchards. The land contained within the park still continues to produce high-quality fruits. The park's visitor center houses a museum about California's citrus industry, and antique citrus grove farm equipment is on display around the park. In 2002 Huell Howser Productions, in association with KCET/Los Angeles, featured the park in California's Golden Parks; the 28 minute program is available as a VHS videorecording.

The prominent Bernal Heights hill overlooks the San Francisco skyline and features a microwave transmission tower. The nearby Sutro Tower can be seen from the Bernal Heights neighborhood. Location Bernal Heights lies to the south of San Francisco's Mission District. Its most prominent feature is the open parkland and radio tower on its large rocky hill, Bernal Heights Summit. Bernal is bounded by Cesar Chavez Street to the north, San Jose Avenue to the west, US 101 to the east, and I-280 to the south.  History  Bernal Heights was part of the 1839 Rancho Rincon de las Salinas y Potrero Viejo, a Mexican land grant awarded to Jos√© Cornelio Bernal (1796‚Äì1842). By 1860, the land belonged to Fran√ßois Louis Alfred Pioche (1818‚Äì1872), a Frenchman and financier, who subdivided it into smaller lots. Its streets were laid out during the Civil War by Army engineers from the Presidio, which explains why so many Bernal streets are named for military men. It was first populated primarily by Irish immigrants who farmed the land and ran dairy ranches. According to legend, a mini gold rush was triggered in 1876 when con artists planted the hilltop with traces of gold. Bernal Heights remained undeveloped until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Built atop bedrock, the hill's structures survived the tremor, and the sparseness of the development saved much of Bernal from the ravages of the firestorm that followed. The commercial corridor of Eugenia Avenue filled in with shops as the pastureland on the hilltop was developed for workers' homes during the rapid rebuilding of the city. Some of the tiny earthquake cottages cottages], which the city built to house quake refugees, survive to this day, including three that were moved up to Bernal Heights. During World War II, the area saw another population surge. The new arrivals included many African-American families who worked at the nearby San Francisco Naval Shipyard at Hunters Point. During the Vietnam War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Hill\\" for the anti-war activists in shared households and collectives who moved in among the working-class families.Marlene Goldman, Little Black Book of San Francisco, Peter Pauper Press, Inc., Jun 1, 2007 By the 1990s, Bernal's pleasant microclimate, small houses (some with traditional Victorian or Edwardian architecture) and freeway access to the peninsula and Silicon Valley led to a third wave of migration. Bernal has not gentrified to the extent of its neighbor Noe Valley, but gentrification and property values are increasing as urban professionals replace working-class home owners and renters. Notable residents and former residents include Tom Ammiano, Honey Lee Cottrell, Dan Nakamura, Annie Sprinkle, Charles Gatewood, Terry Zwigoff Matt Nathanson, and children's author Jane Wattenberg (aka Mrs. Mustard). Bernal Heights. The Mission District is in the foreground and Hunters Point and the bay are in the background Attractions and characteristics Swing near the top of Bernal Heights Park, looking east. The neighborhood is primarily residential, with a commercial strip along Cortland Avenue featuring restaurants, bakeries, a fish and butchery shop, multiple salons, the second Good Life natural grocery store (the first is on Potrero Hill), a wine and beer store, restaurants, and bars. The local branch of the San Francisco Public Library at 500 Cortland was built by Frederick H. Meyer with funding from the Works Progress Administration and dedicated in 1940. After closing for nearly two years for renovations and after much long-standing contention over the murals that adorn the library's exterior, the library reopened in January 2010. There is also a collection of restaurants and caf√©s at the bottom of the northern slope, near the Cesar Chavez Avenue border. They center around the newly renovated rectangular Precita Park. Also notable in that area is Precita Eyes, a mural art center. A strong tradition of neighborhood activism led to the establishment of the Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center in 1979. It works to promote community organizing, affordable housing services, senior services, and youth services. Additionally, the neighborhood center hosts \\"Fiesta on the Hill,\\" one of the last street fairs of the summer festival season. The fair is billed as a \\"community-building event,\\" and takes place on the third Sunday in October. Bernal's north slope has been referred to as one of San Francisco's \\"banana belts\\", with warmer temperatures from San Francisco Bay and less marine fog making its way inland. The grassland on the hilltop is home to a remarkable urban ecosystem, including the majority of native north-coast wildflowers ‚Äî most notable of which is the state flower: the California poppy ‚Äî raccoons, opossums, skunks, raptors (including American kestrels, red-tailed hawks, Cooper's hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and great horned owls), and at times, at least one coyote. The radio tower is a major connection point for the metropolitan San Francisco area. Bernal Hill Park is a designated \\"off-leash\\" park for dogs, and it is a destination for many dogs and their owners since it is one of the largest parks in San Francisco. Bernal Heights Boulevard, which circles the hilltop, has about a path of asphalt and hard packed sand for walking and running that is closed to motor traffic. It is also the site of the San Francisco Illegal Soapbox Society's annual derby. Precita Park, named after its eponymous creek, and Holly Park provide grassy open areas to the north and south of the hill, respectively. The park is known for its unusually steep streets. Bradford above Tompkins, with an alleged 41% grade, is claimed to be the steepest in the world, but this has yet to be graded by Guinness World Records. =Alemany Farmers' Market= The southeast corner of Bernal Heights is home to the open-air Alemany Farmers' Market, one of the oldest extant farmers' markets in the US, operating every Saturday in this location since August 4, 1947. A flea market occupies the market area on Sundays. The Market gets its name from the Alemany Farm located in the neighborhood. In turn, the farm is home to the Alemany Farm Springs. Geology Bernal Hill, along with the other hills in the San Francisco area, is a folded hill, created by the \\"wrinkling up\\" effect of the Pacific Plate subducting under the North American Plate, when the North American and Pacific plates were converging, around 150 million years ago. Near the summit you will find folded layers of very hard rock called radiolarian chert. It is a high in silica sedimentary rock which gets its silica content from the shells of microscopic creatures called radiolaria. The red color comes from iron oxide. In between the layers of chert are thinner layers of shale in many different colors from the same red as the surrounding rock to white, green and purple. Other types of rocks and minerals on the hill include serpentinite,Serpentinite jasperJasper and clay. The alternating layers of rock type suggest a seasonal cycle of influx of sea water, carrying the radiolaria and outflow of the Sacramento River carrying silt and mud.

It is named in honor of American Revolutionary War Brigadier General Francis Marion. History The university dates back to 1957, when the University of South Carolina set up a freshman college in a basement room of the Florence County Library. A few years later, in 1961, USC-Florence was set up on land donated by the Wallace family six miles east of Florence, South Carolina. Buoyed by these successes, a group of Florence-area citizens continued to push for the establishment of a four-year university in Florence to allow better access to higher education for the people of that area. The existing USC-F was an obvious foundation for a new institution. After several years of lobbying, Governor Robert E. McNair signed into law an act creating Francis Marion College, effective July 1, 1970. The newly created Francis Marion College initially enrolled 907 students from 23 of South Carolina's 46 counties. In 1992, Francis Marion College achieved university status and subsequently changed its name to Francis Marion University. Today, Francis Marion has a student body of approximately 4,000. FMU draws students from across the country and around the world, but remains true to its original mission: to educate the people of the Pee Dee Region and the State of South Carolina. The student body's average in-state enrollment is 95 percent. Just more than half of FMU's students come from the Pee Dee Region. Francis Marion is one of South Carolina's 13 public universities. Its academic departments are segmented into three schools (School of Business, School of Education, School of Health Sciences) and the College of Liberal Arts. The Slave Houses, Gregg Plantation, located on the FMU campus, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Academics Forest Villas, Francis Marion's apartment complex Francis Marion University offers five undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of General Studies, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Graduate degrees include the Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, Master of Science in Applied Psychology (clinical and school psychology tracks), and Specialist in School Psychology. All master's degree programs are accredited by their respective professional organizations. In 2017, FMU gained approval for its first doctoral program, a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). The first class of DNP students enrolled in January 2018. Front View of Stokes Administration Building Francis Marion is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award bachelor's and master's degrees. The business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The teacher education programs of the university are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and approved by the South Carolina State Board of Education under standards developed by the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC). The baccalaureate degree nursing program is accredited by the National League for Nursing. The chemistry program is approved by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society. The graduate psychology program is accredited by the Masters in Psychology Accreditation Council (MPAC) and meets the standards of training approved by the Council of Applied Master's Programs in Psychology (CAMPP). The Master of Science in Applied Psychology Program is accredited by the Interorganizational Board for Accreditation of Master's in Psychology Programs (IBAMPP). The theater arts program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST), and the visual arts and art education programs are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). The University is approved by the South Carolina State Board of Education and is a member of the American Council on Education and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. Campus Located on a tract of land originally included in a grant by the King of England and later made a cotton plantation by the Wallace Family, Francis Marion University is situated east of Florence. The campus includes of mixed pine- hardwood and bottomland forests accessed by a series of trails. The University is located on U.S. Highways 76 and 301 and is just an hour's drive from Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand and 4 hours from the Blue Ridge Mountains. With a metropolitan-area population of 200,000, the city of Florence is nestled alongside Interstate 95, the main north‚Äìsouth corridor from the New England area to Miami, and at the eastern end of Interstate 20. The city is served by Amtrak, bus service, and a regional airport. =Academic facilities= Lee Nursing Building, home of the FMU Nursing Program The university's physical plant includes ten major buildings: J.

She is twice runner-up at the Women's World Chess Championship, in 1999 and 2006, and three-time Russian women's champion (1997, 2009, 2010). She was known as \\"Alisa Galliamova-Ivanchuk\\" from 1993 to 2001. She played for the gold medal- winning Russian team at the 2010 Women's Chess Olympiad and for the gold medal-winning Ukrainian team in the 1992 Women's European Team Chess Championship. Career Galliamova won the World Under-16 Girls' Championship in 1987 and 1988. In 1988 she also won the World Junior Girls Championship. In December 1997, she won the Candidates Tournament for the Women's World Chess Championship held in Groningen, Netherlands. She was scheduled to play a match with Xie Jun, who finished second, in August, 1998 and the winner of that match was supposed to play a match in November 1998 with Zsuzsa Polgar for the Women's World Chess Championship. However, after the match with Xie Jun had already been scheduled, Galliamova objected because the entire match was scheduled to be played in China, the home of her rival. The reason for this was because only China had bid for the match. Galliamova wanted half of the match to be played in Kazan, Russia. However, the Russians did not have the money required. Xie-Galliamova: From Beginning to End By Sun Lianzhi Finally, when Galliamova failed to show up to play the match, the match was declared forfeited to Xie Jun. FIDE then scheduled a match between Xie Jun and Zsuzsa Polgar for November 1998. However, Polgar said that she could not play at that time because she was pregnant. After Polgar had given birth to her son, Tom, in March, 1999, FIDE again tried to schedule a match. This time Polgar said that she could not play the match because she was nursing.

It runs westward from Kenai Lake in the Kenai Mountains, through the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and Skilak Lake to its outlet into the Cook Inlet of the Pacific Ocean near Kenai and Soldotna. Geography Kenai River bank The Kenai River [Kee-nye] is a meltwater river that drains the central Kenai Peninsula region. Its source is the Kenai Lake. Near Cooper Landing, the lake narrows to form the river. About from the lake, the river passes through Kenai Canyon for about of fast-flowing whitewater rapids. The Russian River empties into the Kenai several miles west of Cooper Landing. from Kenai Lake, the river enters Skilak Lake. The Kenai Lake to Skilak section is commonly referred to as the \\"Upper River\\". The portion from Skilak Lake downstream to the Sterling Highway bridge near Soldotna is known as \\"Middle River\\". The final from the bridge to the mouth at Cook Inlet is known as the \\"Lower River\\", where the flow is much gentler. The final are greatly influenced by changing tides. Fish The Kenai River running past Soldotna Creek Park in downtown Soldotna, June 2013 The Kenai River is the most popular sport fishing destination in Alaska, particularly for king salmon (Chinook salmon). Each year there are two runs each of king salmon, coho salmon, sockeye salmon, plus a run of pink salmon every other year. The world record king salmon, which weighed about 44 kg (97 lb), was caught in the Kenai River in 1985. The Kenai is also the home of trophy size rainbow trout and Dolly Varden. Stretching to sizes over 76.2 cm (30 inches). Occasionally there will be reports of catching of \\"Steelhead\\"(Sea-run Trout). The king salmon fishery is not as prolific as in other Alaskan rivers, but the Kenai is known for its large fish. A typical king in the second run, beginning in mid-July, weighs 40‚Äì85 pounds (18‚Äì23 kg), with considerably larger specimens not uncommon. The \\"Lower Kenai\\" is well known for its run and sizes of its king salmon. In recent years, the king salmon fishery has been closed or heavily restricted due to low returns of fish.Cochran, Shaylon, ADFG Anticipating another low king salmon return KDLL/Alaska News Nightly1/22/2014 The coho salmon runs occur in early August and early October. The September run is favored by local anglers due to the larger size of the silver salmon. The sockeye salmon runs are in late-June (bluebacks) and early-August. Sockeyes are considered the premier salmon for eating, canning, and smoking. The pink salmon run occurs in even numbered years only. These fish are considered pests by many anglers because they interfere with catching other species and because, by the time they reach inland freshwater, their meat may be soft and oily compared to other species. On a heavy day, even a casual fisher might catch several dozen of the species. Other wildlife The Kenai in winter, March 2007 Along with Kenai's fish, the Kenai River area is home to other wildlife, including moose, bears, and multiple species of birds. Management Over of the river and lakes are managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources as the Kenai River Special Management Area, from inland of the river mouth at Cook Inlet, to upstream. Adjacent to the management district are fifteen different parks.

It is located in Mariposa on the Mariposa County fairgrounds. The big news of 1848 was the discovery of gold in California. This event created international interest and soon a mass immigration of fortune seekers and pioneers trekked their way to pan the streams for gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills. More than a century later, gold and legends of Old West mining continue to fascinate historians. Although this is one of California's newest state parks, the museum houses a collection that was started in 1865 in San Francisco ‚Äî the official California State Mineral Collection, with over 13,000 minerals, rocks, gems, fossils, and historic artifacts. Recently returned (in 2000) is the popular crystalline gold \\"Fricot Nugget\\", weighing 201 troy ounces (6.25 kg) ‚Äî the largest one found during the Gold Rush. Illustrative of days long-gone is a working scale model of a stamp mill, demonstrating the process of extracting gold from quartz rock. In spring of 2001, the mining tunnel connected to the museum was reopened. The tunnel is a trip back through time, focusing on the lives of miners working in California's hard rock mines during the later part of the Gold Rush. It allows visitors to experience first-hand what it felt like to spend the day working inside a dark, cool and damp underground chamber, excavated from solid rock and shored up with timbers. A visit to the California State Mining and Mineral Museum offers the visitor the chance to explore the wealth of the Mother Lode, view minerals and gems from around the world, and to experience a little bit of California's mining history adventures. Throughout the year special rotating displays from private collections and other institutions will be exhibited, making return trips to this museum well worth your time. Educators can call the museum for information on curriculum based educational programs for Grades 1 to 12 and college level.

In 1992, she became the fifth woman to earn the FIDE title of Grandmaster (GM). Since the early 1980s, she has been one of the strongest female players in the world as well as having been the highest rated woman in the FIDE World Rankings on three occasions. She was the clear number one rated woman in the January 1984 rating lists, and joint number one rated woman in the July 1984 and January 1996 lists. Career Cramling is, aside from Judit Polgar (who elected to not play in women's events), the only woman to have earned the grandmaster title before 2000 who has never won the Women's World Champion crown. According to Cramling, one explanation for this is that the World Championship is a team effort and more prominent chess nations are able to give their players better support in important events. Nevertheless, Cramling has been in reasonably close contention for the crown on four occasions (all in different decades). In the 1986 and 1996 Candidates cycle she came in fourth and third respectively. Since the Women's World Championship has been held with the knock-out format, she reached the semifinals in 2008 and 2015. These latter results qualified her to play in the FIDE Women's Grand Prix series in 2009‚Äì11 and 2015‚Äì16 respectively. She has had greater success in Europe where she won the Women's European Individual Chess Championship in 2003 and 2010. In 2006, she won the Accentus Ladies Tournament in Biel. In team competitions, Cramling represented Sweden in the Chess Olympiad in both the open and women's events, European Team Chess Championship in both open and women's sections, Telechess Olympiad and Nordic Cup.

Scholarship fund The Ninety-Nines Amelia Earhart Memorial Scholarship Fund (AEMSF) program assists in funding flight training for both recreational and career track women pilots by awarding a scholarship for an entire pilot certificate or rating to qualified members. The AEMSF \\"Fly Now\\" scholarship is a progressive milestone award of up to $6,000 to assist a Ninety-Nine in completing her Private Pilot training. In addition to the AEMSF program, many individual chapters of the Ninety-Nines give their own flight scholarships to benefit local woman aviators. Aspiring professional pilots can find career guidance and mentors in the Ninety-Nines \\"Professional Pilot Leadership Initiative\\" program. Museums and activities =Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum= The Ninety-Nines are owner-custodians of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison, Kansas. The birthplace and early childhood home of early aviator Amelia Earhart has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been returned to its turn-of-the-century condition by the \\"99s\\"; it features an abundance of personal and family memorabilia. =99s Museum of Women Pilots= Their international headquarters building on Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is home to the 99s Museum of Women Pilots. Museum artifacts include historical papers, personal items, video and oral histories, photos, memorabilia and other notable artifacts from famed woman aviators from around the globe. The museum collection and exhibits provide insight into the role women pilots played in the development of aviation and their historical footprint. =Activities= Ninety-Nines members support the goals of the organization by being active in numerous aviation activities, including : aviation education seminars in the community, air racing, from the Powder Puff Derby to the Palms to Pines and the Air Race Classic; and airmarking by volunteering their time to paint airport names, compass rose symbols and other identifications on airports and the National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA). Most regional and national NIFA competitions have \\"99s\\" on their panels of judges.

The Grimaldi dynasty is a princely house originating in Genoa, founded by the Genoese leader of the Guelphs, Francesco Grimaldi, who in 1297 took the lordship of Monaco along with his soldiers dressed as Franciscans. In that principality his successors have reigned to the present day. During much of the Ancien Regime the family spent much of its time in the French court, where from 1642 they used their French title of Duke of Valentinois. The current head of the family is Albert II of Monaco, Sovereign Prince of Monaco, son and successor of Prince Rainier III and the princess consort Grace of Monaco, formerly Grace Kelly. Prince's Palace of Monaco Beginnings in Genoa The Grimaldis descend from Grimaldo, a Genoese statesman at the time of the early Crusades. He may have been a son of Otto Canella, a consul of the Republic of Genoa in 1133. In turn Grimaldo became a consul in 1160, 1170 and again in 1184. His numerous descendants led maritime expeditions throughout the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and soon the North Sea. They quickly became one of the most powerful families of Genoa. The Grimaldis feared that the head of a rival Genoese family could break the fragile balance of power in a political coup and become lord of Genoa, as had happened in other Italian cities. They entered into a Guelphic alliance with the Fieschi family and defended their interests with the sword. But the Guelfs were banned from the city in 1271, and took refuge in their castles in Liguria and Provence. They signed a treaty with Charles of Anjou, King of Naples and Count of Provence to retake control of Genoa, and generally to provide mutual assistance. In 1276, they accepted a peace under the auspices of the Pope, which however did not put an end to the civil war. Not all the Grimaldis chose to return to Genoa, as they preferred to settle in their fiefdoms, where they could raise armies. In 1299, the Grimaldis and their allies launched a few galleys to attack the port of Genoa before taking refuge on the Western Riviera. During the following years, the Grimaldis entered into different alliances that would allow them to return to power in Genoa. This time, it was the turn of their rivals, the Spinola family, to be exiled from the city. During this period, both the Guelphs and Ghibellines took and abandoned the castle of Monaco, which was ideally located to launch political and military operations against Genoa. Therefore, the tale of Francis Grimaldi and his faction ‚Äî who took the castle of Monaco disguised as friars in 1297 ‚Äî is largely anecdotal. In the early 14th century, the Aragonese raided the shores of Provence and Liguria, challenging Genoa and King Robert of Provence. In 1353, the combined fleet of eighty Venetian and Aragonese galleys gathered in Sardinia to meet the fleet of sixty galleys under the command of Anthony Grimaldi. Only nineteen Genoese vessels survived the battle. Fearing an invasion, Genoa rushed to request the protection of the Lord of Milan. Several of the oldest feudal branches of the House of Grimaldi appeared during these conflicts, such as the branches of Antibes, Beuil, Nice, Puget, and Sicily. In 1395, the Grimaldis took advantage of the discords in Genoa to take possession of Monaco, which they then ruled as a condominium. This is the origin of today's principality. As was customary in Genoa, the Grimaldis organised their family ties within a corporation called albergo. In the political reform of 1528, the Grimaldi became one of the 28 alberghi of the Republic of Genoa, which included the Doria and Pallavicini families, and to which other families were formally invited to join. The House of Grimaldi provided several doges, cardinals, cabinet ministers, and military officers of historical note. French influences Provence became a part of the Kingdom of France from 1486, and occasionally the Grimaldi relied upon French support to preserve their independence from the Republic of Genoa and the Duchy of Savoy. In the process they married into the French nobility in the 1600s, inherited French estates, and often lived in Paris, latterly at the H√¥tel Matignon, until the French Revolution of 1789. Monaco and the neighbouring County of Nice was taken by the revolutionary army in 1792, and were French-controlled until 1815. Nice passed back to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815; then it was ceded to France by the Treaty of Turin (1860). Monaco was re-established by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, with a brief Italian occupation in 1940-43. Modern succession By convention, sovereign European houses are reckoned in the male line. Therefore, since 1731, it has been determined genealogically that it was in fact the French noble House of Goyon-Matignon that ruled as Princes of Monaco until 1949. However, one of the terms of James de Goyon de Matignon becoming Prince of Monaco jure uxoris was that he adopt the name and arms of Grimaldi so that the house would be preserved on the throne, and the right of succession was through his wife Louise-Hippolyte Grimaldi, who abdicated in her husband's favour. Similarly, when Charlotte Louvet was legitimised in 1911 and made successor to Monaco, her husband, Count Pierre de Polignac, adopted, as a condition of the marriage, the name and arms of Grimaldi. In this way the \\"Grimaldi\\" name and arms were continued. Until 2002, a treaty between Monaco and France stated that if the reigning Prince ever failed to leave dynastic offspring, then sovereignty over the Grimaldi realm would revert to France. The 2002 agreement modified this to expand the pool of potential heirs to dynastic collaterals of the reigning Prince (excluding adoptive heirs, hitherto allowed, e.g. Princess Charlotte and her descendants), guaranteeing Monegasque independence. Article I of Monaco's house law requires that the reigning Prince or Princess bear the surname of Grimaldi. The coat of arms of the House of Grimaldi is simply described as fusily argent and gules, i.e., a red and white diamond pattern, with no further modifiers.

Given a field F, if D is a subring of F such that either x or x ‚àí1 belongs to D for every nonzero x in F, then D is said to be a valuation ring for the field F or a place of F. Since F in this case is indeed the field of fractions of D, a valuation ring for a field is a valuation ring. Another way to characterize the valuation rings of a field F is that valuation rings D of F have F as their field of fractions, and their ideals are totally ordered by inclusion; or equivalently their principal ideals are totally ordered by inclusion. In particular, every valuation ring is a local ring. The valuation rings of a field are the maximal elements of the set of the local subrings in the field partially ordered by dominance or refinement, where :(A,\\\\mathfrak{m}_A) dominates (B,\\\\mathfrak{m}_B) if A \\\\supset B and \\\\mathfrak{m}_A \\\\cap B = \\\\mathfrak{m}_B. Every local ring in a field K is dominated by some valuation ring of K. An integral domain whose localization at any prime ideal is a valuation ring is called a Pr√ºfer domain.  Definitions  There are several equivalent definitions of valuation ring (see below for the characterization in terms of dominance). For an integral domain D and its field of fractions K, the following are equivalent: # For every nonzero x in K, either x in D or x‚àí1 in D. # The ideals of D are totally ordered by inclusion. # The principal ideals of D are totally ordered by inclusion (i.e., the elements in D are totally ordered by divisibility.) # There is a totally ordered abelian group Œì (called the value group) and a surjective group homomorphism (called the valuation) ŒΩ: K√ó ‚Üí Œì with D = { x ‚àà K√ó  ŒΩ(x) ‚â• 0 } ‚à™ {0}. The equivalence of the first three definitions follows easily. A theorem of states that any ring satisfying the first three conditions satisfies the fourth: take Œì to be the quotient K√ó/D√ó of the unit group of K by the unit group of D, and take ŒΩ to be the natural projection. We can turn Œì into a totally ordered group by declaring the residue classes of elements of D as \\"positive\\". Even further, given any totally ordered abelian group Œì, there is a valuation ring D with value group Œì (see a section below). From the fact that the ideals of a valuation ring are totally ordered, one can conclude that a valuation ring is a local domain, and that every finitely generated ideal of a valuation ring is principal (i.e., a valuation ring is a B√©zout domain). In fact, it is a theorem of Krull that an integral domain is a valuation ring if and only if it is a local B√©zout domain. It also follows from this that a valuation ring is Noetherian if and only if it is a principal ideal domain. In this case, it is either a field or it has exactly one non- zero prime ideal; in the latter case it is called a discrete valuation ring. (By convention, a field is not a discrete valuation ring.) A value group is called discrete if it is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers, and a valuation ring has a discrete valuation group if and only if it is a discrete valuation ring. Very rarely, valuation ring may refer to a ring that satisfies the second or third condition but is not necessarily a domain. A more common term for this type of ring is \\"uniserial ring\\".  Examples  * Any field \\\\mathbb{F} is a valuation ring. For example, the ring of rational functions \\\\mathbb{F}(X) on an algebraic variety X.The role of valuation rings in algebraic geometryDoes there exist a Riemann surface corresponding to every field extension? Any other hypothesis needed? * A simple non-example is the integral domain \\\\Complex[X] since the inverse of a generic f/g \\\\in \\\\Complex(X) is g/f ot\\\\in \\\\Complex[X] * The field of power series: ::\\\\mathbb{F}((X)) =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f(X) = \\\\sum_{i> -\\\\infty}^\\\\infty a_iX^i \\\\right\\\\\\\\} :has the valuation v(f) = \\\\inf olimits_{a_n eq 0} n. The subring \\\\mathbb{F}X is a valuation ring as well. * \\\\Z_{(p)}, the localization of the integers \\\\Z at the prime ideal (p), consisting of ratios where the numerator is any integer and the denominator is not divisible by p. The field of fractions is the field of rational numbers \\\\Q. * The ring of meromorphic functions on the entire complex plane which have a Maclaurin series (Taylor series expansion at zero) is a valuation ring. The field of fractions are the functions meromorphic on the whole plane. If f does not have a Maclaurin series then 1/f does. * Any ring of p-adic integers \\\\Z_p for a given prime p is a local ring, with field of fractions the p-adic numbers \\\\Q_p. The integral closure \\\\Z_p^{\\\\text{cl}} of the p-adic integers is also a local ring, with field of fractions \\\\Q_p^{\\\\text{cl}} (the algebraic closure of p-adic numbers). Both \\\\Z_p and \\\\Z_p^{\\\\text{cl}} are valuation rings. * Let k be an ordered field. An element of k is called finite if it lies between two integers n < x < m; otherwise it is called infinite. The set D of finite elements of k is a valuation ring. The set of elements x such that x ‚àà D and x‚àí1‚àâD is the set of infinitesimal elements; and an element x such that x ‚àâ D and x‚àí1 ‚àà D is called infinite. * The ring F of finite elements of a hyperreal field *R (an ordered field containing the real numbers) is a valuation ring of *R. F consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, which is equivalent to saying a hyperreal number x such that ‚àín < x < n for some standard integer n. The residue field, finite hyperreal numbers modulo the ideal of infinitesimal hyperreal numbers, is isomorphic to the real numbers. * A common geometric example comes from algebraic plane curves. Consider the polynomial ring \\\\Complex[x, y] and an irreducible polynomial f in that ring. Then the ring \\\\Complex[x, y] / (f) is the ring of polynomial functions on the curve \\\\\\\\{(x, y) : f(x, y) = 0\\\\\\\\}. Choose a point P = (P_x, P_y) \\\\in \\\\Complex^2 such that f(P) = 0 and it is a regular point on the curve; i.e., the local ring R at the point is a regular local ring of Krull dimension one or a discrete valuation ring. * For example, consider the inclusion (\\\\mathbb{C}X^2,(X^2)) \\\\hookrightarrow (\\\\mathbb{C}X,(X)). These are all subrings in the field of bounded-below power series \\\\mathbb{C}((X)).  Construction  For a given totally ordered abelian group Œì and a residue field k, define K = k((Œì)) to be the ring of formal power series whose powers come from Œì, that is, the elements of K are functions from Œì to k such that the support (the elements of Œì where the function value is not the zero of k) of each function is a well-ordered subset of Œì. Addition is pointwise, and multiplication is the Cauchy product or convolution, that is the natural operation when viewing the functions as power series: : \\\\sum_{g \\\\in G} f(g) x^g with x^g \\\\cdot x^h = x^{g+h}. The valuation ŒΩ(f) for f in K is defined to be the least element of the support of f, that is the least element g of Œì such that f(g) is nonzero. The f with ŒΩ(f)‚â•0 (along with 0 in K), form a subring D of K that is a valuation ring with value group Œì, valuation ŒΩ, and residue field k. This construction is detailed in , and follows a construction of which uses quotients of polynomials instead of power series.  Dominance and integral closure  The units, or invertible elements, of a valuation ring are the elements x such that x ‚àí1 is also a member of D. The other elements of D, called nonunits, do not have an inverse, and they form an ideal M. This ideal is maximal among the (totally ordered) ideals of D. Since M is a maximal ideal, the quotient ring D/M is a field, called the residue field of D. In general, we say a local ring (S,\\\\mathfrak{m}_S) dominates a local ring (R,\\\\mathfrak{m}_R) if S \\\\supset R and \\\\mathfrak{m}_S \\\\cap R = \\\\mathfrak{m}_R; in other words, the inclusion R \\\\subset S is a local ring homomorphism. Every local ring (A, \\\\mathfrak{p}) in a field K is dominated by some valuation ring of K. Indeed, the set consisting of all subrings R of K containing A and 1 ot\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}R is nonempty and is inductive; thus, has a maximal element R by Zorn's lemma. We claim R is a valuation ring. R is a local ring with maximal ideal containing \\\\mathfrak{p}R by maximality. Again by maximality it is also integrally closed. Now, if x ot\\\\in R, then, by maximality, \\\\mathfrak{p}R[x] = R[x] and thus we can write: :1 = r_0 + r_1 x + \\\\cdots + r_n x^n, \\\\quad r_i \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}R. Since 1 - r_0 is a unit element, this implies that x^{-1} is integral over R; thus is in R. This proves R is a valuation ring. (R dominates A since its maximal ideal contains \\\\mathfrak{p} by construction.) A local ring R in a field K is a valuation ring if and only if it is a maximal element of the set of all local rings contained in K partially ordered by dominance. This easily follows from the above. Let A be a subring of a field K and f: A \\\\to k a ring homomorphism into an algebraically closed field k. Then f extends to a ring homomorphism g: D \\\\to k, D some valuation ring of K containing A. (Proof: Let g: R \\\\to k be a maximal extension, which clearly exists by Zorn's lemma. By maximality, R is a local ring with maximal ideal containing the kernel of f. If S is a local ring dominating R, then S is algebraic over R; if not, S contains a polynomial ring R[x] to which g extends, a contradiction to maximality. It follows S/\\\\mathfrak{m}_S is an algebraic field extension of R/\\\\mathfrak{m}_R. Thus, S \\\\to S/\\\\mathfrak{m}_S \\\\hookrightarrow k extends g; hence, S = R.) If a subring R of a field K contains a valuation ring D of K, then, by checking Definition 1, R is also a valuation ring of K. In particular, R is local and its maximal ideal contracts to some prime ideal of D, say, \\\\mathfrak{p}. Then R = D_\\\\mathfrak{p} since R dominates D_\\\\mathfrak{p}, which is a valuation ring since the ideals are totally ordered. This observation is subsumed to the following: there is a bijective correspondence \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\mapsto D_\\\\mathfrak{p}, \\\\operatorname{Spec}(D) \\\\to the set of all subrings of K containing D. In particular, D is integrally closed, and the Krull dimension of D is the cardinality of proper subrings of K containing D. In fact, the integral closure of an integral domain A in the field of fractions K of A is the intersection of all valuation rings of K containing A. Indeed, the integral closure is contained in the intersection since the valuation rings are integrally closed. Conversely, let x be in K but not integral over A. Since the ideal x^{-1} A[x^{-1}] is not A[x^{-1}], it is contained in a maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{p}. Then there is a valuation ring R that dominates the localization of A[x^{-1}] at \\\\mathfrak{p}. Since x^{-1} \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{m}_R, x ot\\\\in R. The dominance is used in algebraic geometry. Let X be an algebraic variety over a field k. Then we say a valuation ring R in k(X) has \\"center x on X\\" if R dominates the local ring \\\\mathcal{O}_{x, X} of the structure sheaf at x.  Ideals in valuation rings  We may describe the ideals in the valuation ring by means of its value group. Let Œì be a totally ordered abelian group. A subset Œî of Œì is called a segment if it is nonempty and, for any Œ± in Œî, any element between -Œ± and Œ± is also in Œî (end points included). A subgroup of Œì is called an isolated subgroup if it is a segment and is a proper subgroup. Let D be a valuation ring with valuation v and value group Œì. For any subset A of D, we let \\\\Gamma_A be the complement of the union of v(A - 0) and -v(A - 0) in \\\\Gamma. If I is a proper ideal, then \\\\Gamma_I is a segment of \\\\Gamma. In fact, the mapping I \\\\mapsto \\\\Gamma_I defines an inclusion-reversing bijection between the set of proper ideals of D and the set of segments of \\\\Gamma. Under this correspondence, the nonzero prime ideals of D correspond bijectively to the isolated subgroups of Œì. Example: The ring of p-adic integers \\\\Z_p is a valuation ring with value group \\\\Z. The zero subgroup of \\\\Z corresponds to the unique maximal ideal (p) \\\\subset \\\\Z_p and the whole group to the zero ideal. The maximal ideal is the only isolated subgroup of \\\\Z. The set of isolated subgroups is totally ordered by inclusion. The height or rank r(Œì) of Œì is defined to be the cardinality of the set of isolated subgroups of Œì. Since the nonzero prime ideals are totally ordered and they correspond to isolated subgroups of Œì, the height of Œì is equal to the Krull dimension of the valuation ring D associated with Œì. The most important special case is height one, which is equivalent to Œì being a subgroup of the real numbers ‚Ñù under addition (or equivalently, of the positive real numbers ‚Ñù+ under multiplication.) A valuation ring with a valuation of height one has a corresponding absolute value defining an ultrametric place. A special case of this are the discrete valuation rings mentioned earlier. The rational rank rr(Œì) is defined as the rank of the value group as an abelian group, :\\\\mathrm{dim}_\\\\Q(\\\\Gamma \\\\otimes_\\\\Z \\\\Q). Places = General definition = A place of a field K is a ring homomorphism p from a valuation ring D of K to some field such that, for any x ot\\\\in D, p(1/x) = 0. The image of a place is a field called the residue field of p. For example, the canonical map D \\\\to D/\\\\mathfrak{m}_D is a place.  Example  Let A be a Dedekind domain and \\\\mathfrak{p} a prime ideal. Then the canonical map A_{\\\\mathfrak{p}} \\\\to k(\\\\mathfrak{p}) is a place. = Specialization of places = We say a place p specializes to a place p, denoted by p \\\\rightsquigarrow p', if the valuation ring of p contains the valuation ring of p. In algebraic geometry, we say a prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} specializes to \\\\mathfrak{p}' if \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}'. The two notions coincide: p \\\\rightsquigarrow p' if and only if a prime ideal corresponding to p specializes to a prime ideal corresponding to p in some valuation ring (recall that if D \\\\supset D' are valuation rings of the same field, then D corresponds to a prime ideal of D'.)  Example  For example, in the function field \\\\mathbb{F}(X) of some algebraic variety X every prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\in \\\\text{Spec}(R) contained in a maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} gives a specialization \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\rightsquigarrow \\\\mathfrak{m}.  Remarks  It can be shown: if p \\\\rightsquigarrow p', then p' = q \\\\circ p_{D'} for some place q of the residue field k(p) of p. (Observe p(D') is a valuation ring of k(p) and let q be the corresponding place; the rest is mechanical.) If D is a valuation ring of p, then its Krull dimension is the cardinarity of the specializations other than p to p. Thus, for any place p with valuation ring D of a field K over a field k, we have: : \\\\operatorname{tr.deg}_k k(p) + \\\\dim D \\\\le \\\\operatorname{tr.deg}_k K. If p is a place and A is a subring of the valuation ring of p, then \\\\operatorname{ker}(p) \\\\cap A is called the center of p in A. = Places at infinity = For the function field on an affine variety X there are valuations which are not associated to any of the primes of X. These valuations are called the places at infinity. For example, the affine line \\\\mathbb{A}^1_k has function field k(x). The place associated to the localization of > k\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right] at the maximal ideal > \\\\mathfrak{m}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) is a place at infinity.

Of the five TOMS instruments which were built, four entered successful orbit. The satellites carrying TOMS instruments were: * Nimbus 7; launched October 24, 1978. Operated until 1 August 1994. Carried TOMS instrument number 1. * Meteor-3-5; launched 15 August 1991. Operated until December 1994. Was the first and last Soviet satellite to carry a USA made instrument. Carried TOMS instrument number 2. * ADEOS I; launched 17 August 1996. Operated until 30 June 1997. Mission was cut short by a spacecraft failure. * TOMS-Earth Probe; launched on July 2, 1996. Operated until 2 December 2006. Carried TOMS instrument number 3. * QuikTOMS; launched 21 September 2001. Suffered launch failure and did not enter orbit. Nimbus 7 and Meteor-3-5 provided global measurements of total column ozone on a daily basis and together provided a complete data set of daily ozone from November 1978 to December 1994. After an eighteen-month period when the program had no on-orbit capability, TOMS-Earth Probe launched in 2 July 1996, followed by . ADEOS I was launched on August 17, 1996 and the TOMS-instrument onboard provided data until the satellite which housed it lost power on June 30, 1997. TOMS-Earth Probe (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer - Earth Probe, TOMS-EP, originally just TOMS, COSPAR 1996-037A)https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/toms-ep.htm was launched on July 2, 1996 from Vandenberg AFB by a Pegasus XL rocket. The satellite project was originally known as TOMS, back in 1989 when it was selected as a SMEX mission in the Explorer program. However, it found no funding as an Explorer mission and transferred to NASA's Earth Probe program, getting funding and becoming TOMS-EP. The small, 295 kg satellite was built for NASA by TRW; the single instrument was the TOMS 3 spectrometer. The satellite had a two-year planned life. TOMS-EP suffered a two-year delay to its launch due to launch failures of the first two Pegasus XL rockets. The launch delays led to alternations in the mission; the satellite was placed in a lower than originally planned orbit to achieve higher resolution and to enable more thorough study of UV-absorbing aerosols in the troposphere. The lower orbit was meant to complement measurements from ADEOS I enabling TOMS-EP to provide supplemental measurements. After ADEOS I failed in orbit, TOMS-EP was boosted to a higher orbit to replace ADEOS I. The transmitter for TOMS-Earth Probe failed on December 2, 2006. The only total failure in the series was QuikTOMS, which was launched on September 21, 2001 on a Taurus rocket from Vandenberg AFB, but did not achieve orbit. Since January 1, 2006, data from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has replaced data from TOMS-Earth Probe. The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite on Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 have further continued the data record.

It is one of three Latin American species of tapir. Names Baird's tapir is named for the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird, who traveled to Mexico in 1843 and observed the animals. However, the species was first documented by another American naturalist, W. T. White.Huffman, Brent. Tapirus bairdii. Ultimate Ungulate The tapir is the largest land mammal in Central America. Like the other Latin American tapirs (the mountain tapir, the South American tapir, and the little black tapir), the Baird's tapir is commonly called danta by people in all areas. In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it is referred to as the anteburro. Panamanians, and Colombians call it macho de monte, and in Belize, where the Baird's tapir is the national animal, it is known as the mountain cow. In Mexico, it is called tzemen in Tzeltal; in Lacandon, it is called cash-i-tzimin, meaning \\"jungle horse\\" and in Tojolab'al it is called niguanchan, meaning \\"big animal\\". In Panama, the Kunas people call the Baird's tapir moli in their colloquial language (Tule kaya), oloalikinyalilele, oloswikinyaliler, or oloalikinyappi in their political language (Sakla kaya), and ekwirmakka or ekwilamakkatola in their spiritual language (Suar mimmi kaya). Description Front foot Baird's tapir skull on display at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Baird's tapir has a distinctive cream-colored marking on its face, throat, and tips of its ears with a dark spot on each cheek, behind and below the eye. The rest of its hair is dark brown or grayish brown. This tapir is the largest of the four American species and the largest native land mammal in both Central and South America. Baird's tapirs average in length but can range between , not counting a stubby, vestigal tail of , and in height. Body mass in adults can range from .Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Like the other species of tapirs, they have small, stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. Lifecycle The gestation period is about 400 days, after which one offspring is born. Multiple births are extremely rare, but in September 2020 a Baird's tapir in Boston's Franklin Park Zoo birthed twins. The babies, as with all species of tapir, have reddish-brown hair with white spots and stripes, a camouflage which affords them excellent protection in the dappled light of the forest. This pattern eventually fades into the adult coloration. For the first week of their lives, infant Baird's tapirs are hidden in secluded locations while their mothers forage for food and return periodically to nurse them. Later, the young follow their mothers on feeding expeditions. At three weeks of age, the young are able to swim. Weaning occurs after one year, and sexual maturity is usually reached six to 12 months later. Baird's tapirs can live for over 30 years. Behavior Baird's tapir: sniffing Baird's tapir may be active at all hours, but is primarily nocturnal. It forages for leaves and fallen fruit, using well-worn tapir paths which zig-zag through the thick undergrowth of the forest. The animal usually stays close to water and enjoys swimming and wading ‚Äì on especially hot days, individuals will rest in a watering hole for hours with only their heads above water. It generally leads a solitary life, though feeding groups are not uncommon and individuals, especially those of different ages (young with their mothers, juveniles with adults) are often observed together. The animals communicate with one another through shrill whistles and squeaks. The Baird's tapir has a symbiotic relationship with cleaner birds that remove ticks from its fur: the Yellow-headed Caracara (Milvago chimachima) and the Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus) have both been observed removing and eating ticks from tapirs. The tapirs often lie down for cleaning and also present tick-infested areas to the cleaner birds by lifting limbs and rolling from one side to the other. Adults can be potentially dangerous to humans and should not be approached if spotted in the wild. The animal is most likely to follow or chase a human for a bit, though they have been known to charge and gore humans on rare occasions. Predation and vulnerability A Baird's tapir in a zoo, exhibiting the flehmen response According to the IUCN, Baird's tapir is in danger of extinction, and in 1996 it was officially classified as \\"Vulnerable\\". There are two main contributing factors in the decline of the species; poaching and habitat loss. Though in many areas the animal is only hunted by a few humans, any loss of life is a serious blow to the tapir population, especially because their reproductive rate is so slow. Additionally, there was a study that showed a small population of Baird's tapir in North American and Central American zoos had inbreeding and divergence from the wild population.Norton, J. E. and M. V. Ashley. 2004. Genetic variability and population differentiation in captive Baird's tapirs, Tapirus bairdii. Zoo Biology 23:521-531. In Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama, hunting of the Baird's tapirs is illegal, but the laws protecting them are often unenforced. Furthermore, restrictions against hunting do not address the problem of deforestation. Therefore, many conservationists focus on environmental education and sustainable forestry to try to save the Baird's tapir and other rainforest species from extinction. Attacks on humans are rare and normally in self-defense. In 2006, Carlos Manuel Rodr√≠guez Echandi, the former Costa Rican Minister of Environment and Energy, was attacked and injured by a tapir after he followed it off the trail.Tapir Specialist Group, A High-level Tapir Run-in An adult Baird's tapir, being such a massive mammal, has very few natural predators. Only large adult American crocodiles ( or more) and adult jaguars are capable of preying on tapirs, although even in these cases the outcomes are unpredictable and often in the tapir's favor (as is evident on multiple tapirs documented in Corcovado National Park with large claw marks covering their hides).

Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001, it was later ported to Xbox (which is only released in Europe) and Microsoft Windows in 2002. A PlayStation Portable version was released on October 1, 2009 in Japan and on January 26, 2010 in North America. Gameplay The color tone varies depending on which era Eike time-travels to. For example, the early twentieth century is depicted in grey tones while 1580 appears in earth-colored ones. The objective of Shadow of Memories is to guide player character Eike Kusch through the fictional German town of Lebensbaum (Life's Tree) as he travels through time to prevent and unmask his murderer. The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue. In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the non-player character Homunculus, and travels back in time before his death with the intent of changing events to prevent it. Shadow of Memories lacks traditional action elements, and Eike cannot attack nor does he have a bar displaying his health. The digipad, a time-traveling item given to Eike by Homunculus, requires energy units, which the player can find scattered around the town. The gameplay primarily consists of time-traveling through the different eras, finding items, and interacting through dialogue with the non- player characters. Actions taken in one time period affect future ones; for example, if Eike removes a seal from the squire's manor in 1580, the seal will not appear in the present era. Additionally, the game keeps two digital clocks: one depicting the time in the present-day era and another for whichever era Eike time-travels to. The amount of time Eike spends in the different eras also passes in the present-day one. The cut-scenes and dialogue takes up varying amounts of in-game time. When the clock arrives at the time of Eike's death, the chapter restarts, however, if Eike is not in his time period at the time of his death, the game ends.  Plot  Set in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), Shadow of Memories revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time- traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras‚Äî2001, 1979/1980, 1902 and 1580 to 1584 ‚Äî as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarete; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart. Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarete or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's Stone, to resurrect his mother. =Endings= Shadow of Memories contains eight endings to the plot, with six available at first, the last two being unlocked by achieving the first six. In all endings, Eike discovers that Homunculus was using him to ensure that he would be \\"created\\" (actually unsealed) by Wagner, and returns the digipad to him. Development Developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, a playable demo of Shadow of Memories debuted at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2000. The game went through several development titles: The Day and Night of Walpurgisnacht, Days of Walpurgis, and Time Adventure. Konami released Shadow of Memories for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on February 22, 2001, in North America on March 5, 2001 (retitled as \\"Shadow of Destiny\\"), and in Europe on March 30, 2001. In 2002, the now-defunct Runecraft company ported it to the PC, while an Xbox port appeared simultaneously in Europe and Australasia; a PlayStation Portable port arrived in 2009.  Reception and legacy The PlayStation 2 version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PC and PSP versions received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40. Reviewers praised the overall plot of the PS2 version as the game's strength. IGN's David Zdyrko called the story \\"one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame.\\" Andrew Vestal of GameSpot enjoyed the idea of the detective in a murder mystery as the intended victim. Writing for Game Revolution, Shawn Sanders liked the time-traveling aspect of the game. The graphics of the PS2 version received mixed responses. Sanders found the textures of the game \\"clean and detailed\\". Zdyrko disliked the low amount of detail on the characters and some of the background, but enjoyed the \\"lighting and particle effects\\", particularly the snow and night. Vestal praised the different visual depictions of Lebensbaum, and felt that high level of detail in the backgrounds helped to somewhat counterbalance the low-resolution of the game's graphics. Critics agreed that the full motion videos were well-done, and praised the realistic character animation. Critics commented on the general absence of action in the gameplay. Sanders considered it the game's greatest flaw and a possible source of frustration for players. The slow beginning to the PS2 version was remarked on by critics, who felt that the game eventually picked up after a while. Additionally, the \\"stiff\\" motion of the protagonist when running drew criticism. Reviewers noted the relatively short play time, and felt that the multiple endings enhanced the game's replay value. Kevin Rice reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Good adventure games on consoles are rare, and even if you normally don't like adventure games, this one is worth checking out. It lures players in like few others in recent memory.\\" The game's soundtrack was well received. Critics wrote that it suited the mood and occasionally helped to build suspense. The voice acting also went over well, with several critics remarking on the quality of it. Zdyrko described it as \\"first-class\\" and believable, and commented that since much of the PS2 version consists of dialogue, flawed voice acting might have ruined the game. Vestal considered the voice acting of B-movie quality, but not flawed enough to be a major distraction. Shadow of Memories was a nominee for The Electric Playgrounds 2002 \\"Best Adventure Game for PC\\" and GameSpot's \\"Best Adventure Game on PC\\" awards, but lost variously to Syberia and Silent Hill 2. The latter publication's editors called it \\"one of the best PC adventure games to come around in some time\\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Shadow of Memories the 68th-best adventure game ever released. =Time Hollow= After Shadow of Memories, Kawano wrote and directed another game with a time-traveling element: the 2008 Nintendo DS title Time Hollow; it focuses on seventeen-year-old Ethan Kairos, who awakens in a world where his parents have been missing for twelve years, and his quest to find them. Along the way, he obtains the Hollow Pen, which allows him to create time portals to solve the mystery. Time Hollow continues the \\"themes of time manipulation and paradoxes\\", for which Kawano has expressed an interest.

A total of 1,158 athletes representing 37 National Olympic Committees (NOCs)‚Äîincluding Morocco's first delegation‚Äîparticipated in 35 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. The team relay (4 √ó 7.5 km) event in biathlon was contested for the first time. Fifteen NOCs won at least one medal, and thirteen of them secured at least one gold. For the first time, after three consecutive editions of the Winter Olympics, the Soviet Union did not finish first in the overall and gold medal counts. Having won a total of thirteen medals, of which five were gold, they came second to Norway, whose athletes took home fourteen medals (six golds, six silvers, and two bronzes). This was Norway's comeback to the top spot of both medal rankings, after the 1952 Winter Olympics, and the sixth time since the nation first competed at the inaugural 1924 Winter Games. The host team, France, concluded its participation with a set of nine medals: four golds (tied with Italy), three silvers, and two bronzes. Eight of these medals were obtained in alpine skiing events, and three of the four French Olympic titles were won by a single alpine skier, Jean-Claude Killy, who swept the men's events. East and West Germany entered separate teams for the first time, ending a run of three straight editions (1956‚Äì1964) in which German athletes participated as a single team. Victories by Thomas K√∂hler and Klaus-Michael Bonsack (luge doubles), and by Franz Keller (Nordic combined), resulted in the first Winter Olympics gold medal for East and West Germany, respectively. Czechoslovakia also got its first-ever gold at the Winter Games, thanks to a successful combination of ski jumps by Ji≈ô√≠ Ra≈°ka in the normal hill (70 m) event. Ra≈°ka also secured a silver medal in the large hill (90 m) event, after becoming one of the first Olympic ski jumpers to cross the 100-metre mark. Czechoslovak athletes collected a second silver, in ice hockey, and a bronze, in figure skating, helping the nation to achieve its best result in the Winter Olympics, at that time. In Grenoble, Romania won its first and so far only medal at the Winter Games, as Ion Pan≈£uru and Nicolae Neagoe secured the bronze in bobsleigh's two-man event. Toini Gustafsson, a Swedish cross-country skier, contributed three of her NOC's eight medals, including two of its three golds, with victories in both women's individual events and a runner-up place in the team relay. Half of Italy's four gold medals were obtained by nine-time bobsleigh world champion Eugenio Monti, who finally drove his sled to the Olympic two- and four-man titles, after two silvers in Cortina d'Ampezzo 1956 and two bronzes in Innsbruck 1964. Canada collected three medals, of which two were won by alpine skier Nancy Greene (gold in women's giant slalom and silver in women's slalom). All nine medals secured by athletes of the Dutch delegation were in speed skating events.  Medal table The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by an NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. In speed skating, ties for the second place in the men's 500 m, 1,500 m, and women's 500 m events resulted in the awarding of an additional four silver medals; as a consequence, three bronzes were not presented. This explains the uneven number of total gold (35), silver (39), and bronze (32) medals distributed in these Games. Notes # The Soviet Union began competing at the Winter Games in 1956, and until 1968, it always lead the gold and total medal categories. # Norway's previous medal table leads occurred in 1924, 1928, 1936, 1948 (shared with Sweden), and 1952.

It is located in Old Sacramento State Historic Park at 111 I Street, Sacramento.Addresses- Sacramento Railroad Museum The museum features 21 restored locomotives and railroad cars, some dating back to 1862. The \\"Sierra Scene\\" shows a large scale mockup of a construction scene high in the Sierra Nevada representing Donner Pass circa 1867, featuring the locomotive Gov. Stanford. Other exhibits show how the influence of railroads changed American society, influencing travel, commerce and daily life, as well as the lives of railroaders and the diversity of people who work on railroads. Changing exhibits featuring photography, ephemera, and artifacts from the museum's collection, add depth and incidental information to the overall story of railroad history. The Museum has an extensive educational program for elementary students from across the region to help them learn about railroad history using re- enactments, costumed docents, and including train and handcar rides. The roundhouse area of the museum features a rotating display of locomotives and equipment belonging to the museum. When not on display, these items are stored and worked on at the nearby Sacramento Railyards in the remaining buildings that were part of the original Southern Pacific Shop complex. A large 3-rail O-gauge model train layout is also located in the museum. Adjacent to the main museum building is a reconstruction of the 1870s-era Central Pacific Railroad passenger station and freight depot on Front Street, which houses historic and contemporary railroad equipment. In early 2011, the interior remained closed to public use, but is occasionally open for special events. Between April and October, the Sacramento Southern Railroad, operated by the museum, takes passengers on a 40-minute, roundtrip route along the Sacramento River on a portion of the Walnut Grove branch of the former Southern Pacific Railroad. The Sacramento Southern Railroad owns the Walnut Grove Branch right-of-way that extends south from Sacramento along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River. A few miles of track were rebuilt along the levee near Freeport, California as part of a US Army Corps of Engineers project. The CSRRM hopes to one day have a longer excursion line, perhaps as far as Hood, California. At that location the railroad passengers could disembark the train and take a tourist steamboat back up the Sacramento River to Old Sacramento. History The museum has its origins in 1937, when a group of railroad enthusiasts in the San Francisco Bay Area formed the Pacific Coast Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society. This organization worked for years to promote the idea of a railroad museum, donating 30 historic locomotives and cars to the California Department of Parks and Recreation to be the nucleus of a State-operated museum in Sacramento. The Museum's first facility, the Central Pacific Railroad Passenger Station, opened in 1976. The Railroad History Museum was completed in 1981. Steam-powered passenger train service on the Sacramento Southern Railroad began in 1984, with the Central Pacific Railroad Freight Depot opening three years later. Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown was added to the Museum complex during 1992. The museum became a Smithsonian affiliate in June 2017.

Types =Gram-positive= Streptococcus pneumoniae () is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in all age groups except newborn infants. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium that often lives in the throat of people who do not have pneumonia. 3D medical animation still showing Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria (causative bacteria of meningitis). Other important Gram-positive causes of pneumonia are Staphylococcus aureus () and Bacillus anthracis. =Gram-negative= Gram-negative bacteria are seen less frequently: Haemophilus influenzae (), Klebsiella pneumoniae (), Escherichia coli (), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (), Bordetella pertussis, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common. These bacteria often live in the gut and enter the lungs when contents of the gut (such as vomit or faeces) are inhaled. =Atypical= Atypical bacteria causing pneumonia are Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (), and Legionella pneumophila. The term \\"atypical\\" does not relate to how commonly these organisms cause pneumonia, how well it responds to common antibiotics or how typical the symptoms are; it refers instead to the fact that these organisms have atypical or absent cell wall structures and do not take up Gram stain in the same manner as gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Pneumonia caused by Yersinia pestis is usually called pneumonic plague. Signs and symptoms *Pneumonia *Fever *Rigors *Cough *Runny nose (either direct bacterial pneumonia or accompanied by primary viral pneumonia) *Dyspnea ‚Äì shortness of breath *Chest pain *Shaking chills *Pneumococcal pneumonia can cause coughing up of blood, or hemoptysis, characteristically associated with \\"rusty\\" sputum  Pathophysiology  Bacteria typically enter the lung with inhalation, though they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if other parts of the body are infected. Often, bacteria live in parts of the upper respiratory tract and are continuously being inhaled into the alveoli, the cavities deep in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. Once inside the alveoli, bacteria travel into the spaces between the cells and also between adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. This invasion triggers the immune system to respond by sending white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms (neutrophils) to the lungs. The neutrophils engulf and kill the offending organisms but also release cytokines that result in a general activation of the immune system. This results in the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial and fungal pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and result in impaired oxygen transportation. Bacteria can travel from the lung into the blood stream (bacteremia) and can result in serious illness such as sepsis and eventually septic shock, in which there is low blood pressure leading to damage in multiple parts of the body including the brain, kidney, and heart. They can also travel to the area between the lungs and the chest wall, called the pleural cavity. Prevention Prevention of bacterial pneumonia is by vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for adults and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children), Haemophilus influenzae type B, meningococcus, Bordetella pertussis, Bacillus anthracis, and Yersinia pestis.  Treatment  Antibiotics are the treatment of choice for bacterial pneumonia, with ventilation (oxygen supplement) as supportive therapy. The antibiotic choice depends on the nature of the pneumonia, the microorganisms most commonly causing pneumonia in the geographical region, and the immune status and underlying health of the individual. In the United Kingdom, amoxicillin is used as first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients acquiring pneumonia in the community, sometimes with added clarithromycin. In North America, where the \\"atypical\\" forms of community-acquired pneumonia are becoming more common, clarithromycin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones as single therapy have displaced the amoxicillin as first-line therapy. Local patterns of antibiotic resistance always need to be considered when initiating pharmacotherapy. In hospitalized individuals or those with immune deficiencies, local guidelines determine the selection of antibiotics. =Gram-positive organisms= Streptococcus pneumoniae ‚Äî amoxicillin (or erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin); cefuroxime and erythromycin in severe cases. Staphylococcus aureus ‚Äî flucloxacillin (to counteract the organism's Œ≤-lactamase). =Gram- negative organisms= *Haemophilus influenzae ‚Äî doxycycline; second generation cephalosporins such as cefaclor *Klebsiella pneumoniae *Escherichia coli *Pseudomonas aeruginosa ‚Äî ciprofloxacin *Moraxella catarrhalis =Atypical organisms= *Chlamydophila pneumoniae ‚Äî doxycycline *Chlamydophila psittaci ‚Äî erythromycin *Mycoplasma pneumoniae ‚Äî erythromycin *Coxiella burnetti ‚Äî doxycycline *Legionella pneumophila ‚Äî erythromycin, with rifampicin sometimes added. People who have difficulty breathing due to pneumonia may require extra oxygen. An extremely sick individual may require artificial ventilation and intensive care as life-saving measures while his or her immune system fights off the infectious cause with the help of antibiotics and other drugs.

It was made famous by its transatlantic flight, being the smallest aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Development The RWD 5 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki (their designs were named RWD after their initial letters). It was a further development of earlier RWD aircraft series (RWD 1, RWD 2, RWD 3 and RWD 7), especially of its direct predecessor, the RWD 4. It shared the same wing shape and construction, while the fuselage was totally new, constructed of steel frame, unlike its wooden predecessors. The fuselage had a modern shape and a closed canopy with panoramic windows (earlier models had atypical fish-shaped fuselages with no direct forward view from the pilot's seat). The first prototype (registration SP-AGJ) was flown on 7 August 1931 by its designer Jerzy Drzewiecki. It was built in new workshops of Warsaw University of Technology near Okƒôcie airport, from 1933 converted to Do≈õwiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze (DWL) company. After successes of the prototype in air competitions, a small-scale series production was set up, mostly for the Polish Aero Club. Series aircraft had improved landing gear. Two were built in 1932 (registration SP-AJA and AJB), five in 1933 (including the single-seater RWD 5bis), eleven in 1934 (including one in Aero Club workshops in Lublin) and one more in 1937 (SP-BGX), for a total of 20 aircraft. In 1932, the RWD 5 was shown at the International Air Show in Paris. Service RWD 5s were mostly used as trainers and sport planes by Polish regional aero clubs. They scored good results in local competitions, starting from 1931, when the prototype won the 3rd South-Western Poland Flight (pilot M. Pronaszko) and the 4th Touring Aircraft Contest (pilot Franciszek ≈ªwirko). As sport and touring planes, they were later superseded by the RWD 13, and were relegated mostly for training. Three were written off before 1939. One aircraft was used by LOT Polish Airlines in 1933‚Äì1936 for taxi flights (registration SP-LOT), one by LOPP organization (SP-LOP). After the outbreak of World War II, during the Polish September Campaign, at least three RWD 5 were utilized as liaison aircraft by the Polish Air Force (SP-ALR, ALX, ALZ). Also, Maj. E. Wyrwicki flew RWD 5 from Romania to besieged Warsaw (according to other sources, he flew RWD-5 SP-AJB from Warsaw). None of the RWD 5s survived the war. One RWD 5 was sold to Brazil in 1938 (former SP-LO, removed from the Polish registry on 4 December 1936) and registered there as PP-TDX in 1939. Its airworthiness expired in 1943. In late 1990s, a flying replica of the RWD 5, named RWD 5R, was built in Poland by EEA991 association. It flew first on 26 August 2000,Marcin Sigmund (2018): Na przek√≥r przeciwno≈õciom, \\"Skrzydlata Polska\\" nr 8(2466)/2018, p.44-45 (in Polish) and is powered with 140 hp LOM Praha Avia M-332 engine (registration SP-LOT). The flight across the Atlantic RWD 5bis SP-AJU In March 1933 a special single-seater variant was built, called RWD 5bis (registration SP-AJU), powered with 130 hp Gipsy Major engine. The rear cabin was replaced with an additional 300 l (79 US gal) fuel tank, and the windows were removed. Additional fuel tanks were added in wings, the fuel capacity reached 752 l (199 US gal) in total and a range increased to . Stanis≈Çaw Skar≈ºy≈Ñski flew this plane from Warsaw to Rio de Janeiro from 27 April to 24 June 1933, on a path of . During his travel, on 7 May/8 May, Skar≈ºynski flew the RWD 5bis across the southern Atlantic, from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Maceio in Brazil. The flight took 20 hours 30 minutes (17 hours above the ocean). He crossed , establishing a distance record in the FAI light tourist plane class. The RWD 5bis was at that time the smallest plane that has ever flown across the Atlantic  its empty weight was below 450 kg (1000 lb), loaded 1100 kg (2425 lb). The plane had no radio nor safety equipment, due to weight. It returned to Europe on a ship. After its record-breaking flight, the RWD 5bis was converted to a two-seater variant without additional tanks, and used by Skar≈ºy≈Ñski. The SP-AJU was seized by the Soviets in Lw√≥w in September 1939, after their invasion on Poland. Modern replica Description Mixed construction (steel and wood) high-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout. The fuselage of a steel frame, covered with canvas on a wooden frame (with duralumin in engine section). Trapezoid one-part wing, canvas covered (plywood in front), two-spar, with no mechanization. A crew of two, sitting in tandem in a glazed cockpit, with dual controls and individual doors on the right.

The NIST stone test wall is an experiment by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology to determine how different types of construction stone weather. It includes 2352 samples of stone from 47 different states within the US and 16 different countries. The wall measures approximately 12 m long, 4 m high, 0.6 m thick at the bottom, and 0.3 m at the top. It includes varieties of andesite, argillite, basalt, bluestone, breccia, conglomerate, coquina, coral, dacite, diabase, diorite, dolomite, gabbro, gneiss, granite, granodiorite, greenstone, labradorite, limestone, marble, melaphyre, pitchstone, pumice, pyrophyllite, quartz, quartzite, sandstone, schist, serpentinite, shellstone, soapstone, syenite, travertine, and tuff. The wall was built by one stonemason, Vincent Di Benedeto, in 1948. He used two types of stone-setting mortar on the front. He used both a 1:3 lime mortar, with a high calcium hydrate and a 1:0.4:3 portland cement, whiting, and sand mortar. The wall was moved from its original location in Washington, D.C. to Gaithersburg, Maryland in May 1977.
