It was written during Ignatius' transport from Antioch to his execution in Rome.H. Burn-Murdoch, Church, Continuity and Unity (Cambridge University Press, 2014) p. 120 Composition To the Ephesians is one of seven epistles attributed to Ignatius that are generally accepted as authentic. In 5th century, this collection was enlarged by spurious letters.\\"Spurious Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch\\" at NewAdvent.org It is clear that To the Ephesians was written soon before the martyrdom of Ignatius, but it is uncertain when precisely this martyrdom occurred. Tradition places the martyrdom of Ignatius in the reign of Trajan, who was emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. While many scholars accept the traditional dating of Ignatius' martyrdom under Trajan, others have argued for a somewhat later date. Richard Pervo dated Ignatius' death to 135-140 AD, and British classicist Timothy Barnes has argued for a date some time in the 140s AD. Content Ignatius advises the Ephesians that they should revere and obey their bishop as if he were Christ himself: Interestingly, Ignatius seems to refer to some unknown gospel story, which is not mentioned in the canonical gospel texts: This story of a spectacular celestial light bears some similarities to the nativity story found in the Gospel of Matthew, but Ignatius places it after the death of Jesus, rather than before it.

The company, located in Sebaldsbr√ºck, a settlement in Hemelingen, Bremen, Germany previously produced radiators and fenders for Hansa-Lloyd. Between 1929 and 1931 Hansa-Lloyd was acquired by Carl Borgward and his co-investor Wilhelm Tecklenborg. Borgward also renamed his radiator manufacturing company to Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co.

In 1924, responding to a designer complaining about the material transport for radiator production between the workshops by handcart, Borgward constructed this light truck. In difficult economic times before the Great Depression Borgward discovered a gap in the market. There was a great demand from traders and small business owners for affordable motorized freight carts, that were legal to drive without a license. A Blitzkarren cost 980 Reichsmark. In 1929, a quarter of the licensed commercial vehicles were made in Bremen. Carl Borgward had patented the Blitzkarren division. The patents were granted on June 20, 1925 in Germany, and on March 11, 1926 in England. Previously there had been similar tricycles used as passenger transporters, usually single-seater. Blitzkarren had neither clutch nor starter. The two-stroke motorcycle engine, under the flatbed, was coupled over a V-belt on the left rear wheel and was pushed to start, and choked to stop, which was not difficult from the driver seat in the rear of a 250 kg payload vehicle on a flat road. The single front wheel was mounted in a motorcycle fork, which was controlled from the rear.

His works were filmed and performed on stage and in film in the UK and the United States from the 1920s to the 1940s. Biography Turner married the Scottish silent film actress, Laura Cowie, on June 20, 1918. They later settled in Blue Tiles Farm near Fakenham, Norfolk. During World War 1 Turner wrote three plays: Nothing New, Peace Time Prophecies or Stories Gone Wrong and Tails Up. An early published novel of his from 1919, Simple Souls, was made into a movie in 1920 with a scenario by Fred Myton, directed by the American Robert Thornby. In 1926, Turner's play The Scarlet Lady, a comedy, opened at the Criterion Theatre in London, starring Marie Tempest, a friend and the driving force behind the establishment of the actors' union Equity. Supporting Tempest was an ing√©nue, Fabia Drake, who became Tempest's firm confidante and then Turner's sister-in-law through marriage to his barrister brother, Maxwell Turner. Thereafter, in addition to his solo work, Turner collaborated with other writers, notably Roland Pertwee, with whom he wrote plays, scenarios or dialogues for a number of productions in the early 1930s, including a series of movies directed by John Daumery and William C. McGann, and Irving Asher's now-lost 1935 U.K. production Murder at Monte Carlo directed by Michael Barringer and starring Errol Flynn in his first major role. Turner's work was performed by other leading actors including Margot Grahame (A Letter of Warning, 1932), Nora Swinburne (A Voice Said Goodnight, 1932, Cedric Hardwicke, Boris Karloff and Ralph Richardson (The Ghoul, 1933), and Jane Baxter (The Night of the Party, 1935, directed by Michael Powell.

On 23 October 1918 following the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration was established over Levantine provinces of the former Ottoman Empire. Earlier, on 1 October 1918, General Allenby had been authorized to permit the hoisting of the Arab flag at Damascus.Hansard, : HC Deb 31 October 1918 vol 110 c1640W The political scene in Damascus was dominated by three organizations, al-Nadi al-'Arabi (the Arab Club with strong Palestinian connections), Hizbal-Istiqlal al-'Arabi (the Arab Independence Party connected to al-Fatat) and Al-'Ahd (an Iraqi-run officers association). An Arab government was announced on 5 October 1918 and gained de facto independence after the withdrawal of the British forces on 26 November 1919. The Arab Kingdom of Syria was an unrecognized state proclaimed as a Kingdom on 8 March 1920 and existed until 25 July 1920. During its brief existence, the kingdom was led by Sharif Hussein bin Ali's son Faisal bin Hussein. Despite its claims to the territory of Greater Syria, Faisal's government controlled a limited area and was dependent on Britain which, along with France, generally opposed the idea of a Greater Syria and refused to recognize the kingdom.Itamar Rabinovich, Symposium: The Greater-Syria Plan and the Palestine Problem in The Jerusalem Cathedra (1982), p. 262.

Guatemala is situated in the central area of Central America. In more densely populated regions along the borders there are fences to prevent illegal immigration. Areas close to Guatemalan borders experience high rates of crime. The Central American area, notably the Guatemalan border area, is listed as one of the world's most dangerous places. Guatemala-Mexico Border For nearly 60 years following Guatemalan independence the Guatemalan-Mexican border was the subject of a territorial dispute between the two countries. Particularly, Guatemala claimed Chiapas (especially Soconusco within that state). This dispute was settled in 1882 by an agreement between the two countries following negotiations in New York. In 1958, a brief conflict erupted between the two countries as a result of illegal border crossings. The Guatemala-Mexico border is also an important way-station on the route for migrants fleeing Central America and heading towards the United States. Guatemala-Honduras Border The Guatemala- Honduras border was the subject of a territorial dispute from Guatemalan independence. In 1930, an agreement was signed between the two countries in Washington to settle their dispute through arbitration. The dispute was finally settled through a unanimous award in 1933. Guatemala-Belize dispute Belize and Guatemala have had a long running border dispute, with Guatemala claiming all of Belize's territory. Guatemala-El Salvador border During the civil war in El Salvador, the Guatemalan government was primarily concerned with the risk of conflict and instability spilling over the border between the two countries. This was due to the flight of refugees from the conflict over the border into Guatemala.

The Collected Works by V.Y. Shishkov in 10 volumes. Moscow, Pravda Publishers. 1974.

The fragment of Part 6 was published by Krasnaya Nov in 1932 (Nos. 9 and 10). The whole novel (which took Shishkov twelve years to write) came out as a separate edition in 1933 via Khudozhestvennaya Literatura.

The book was privately published in 2006 by Harry Henderson, Irina Henderson's husband.Gloomy River at the Modern Novel Background In 1891 Shishkov graduated from the Vyshnevolotsk technical college and, after a three-year practice joined the Tomsk regional transport ministry. There he met Nikolai Yefimovich Matyunin, an heir to the rich Yenisei-based merchant family who told him a lot about the history of gold-mining in this region. The prototypes for the Gromov family (grandfather, father and son, respectively) became Kosma, Averyan and Nikolai Matonins.

Synopsis  It is the mid-19th century Siberia, and Danila Gromov on his deathbed reveals to his son Pyotr the whereabouts of the huge wealth he had hidden in the forest, which he had collected in the old times, when being a member of the gang of criminals. Pyotr, even if dogged by huge personal issues, including heavy drinking and mental issues (which eventually drive him into the institution), manages to build a prosperous business on this money, but even more successful proves to be his son Prokhor, a talented and purposeful young man, who creates an industrial empire all through Siberia which brings him great wealth, power and influence. But it seems the evil that Danila Gromov had done, haunts his grandson. Initially, an honest man, Prokhor, through the sequence of catastrophes (including the mysterious death of his lover Anfisa, whom his father also fancies) descends into the mire of vice, betrayal, emotional turmoil and, finally madness which leads him to suicide. Analysis According to Shishkov himself, \\"The major theme of the novel‚Ä¶ is the Capital, with all of its specific stenches and vices. It grows into itself, as well as in every possible way outwards, develops and gains strength, and then, after having reached its limits, it crumbles down, its spurious solidity being challenged by the growing self-consciousness of the workers... Lawlessness, violence, barbarity, merciless exploitation of the labour, all of this is being cursed I the novel, which could be seen as a requiem for the capital, for the whole repressive system of old. The Gloomy River has locked upon itself, and now there is the sunset breaking through the darkness of the old world, there are new voices of the future battles and victories from where the River of Joy flows,\\" he wrote in Literaturny Leningrad, on 7 November 1933. Critical reception and legacy  The book received very positive reviews at the time it was published. It has been described as \\"a vast tapestry\\", \\"a huge integral picture, investigating the genesis of the Russian gold mining industry, its inner contradictions and the birth of the vast working movement.\\"Literaturny Leningrad, 1933, No.13Zvezda, 1935, No.4 \\"Once you've read The Gloomy River, it stays with you forever,\\" wrote B.

Such books are the pride of our literary heritage.\\" Shishkov considered the novel to be his lifetime achievement, and once called it 'great forfeit'. \\"This thing, in terms of density, the concentration of real life and human suffering it deals with, is the main book of my life, and could be the one reason was born at all,\\" he wrote in his 5 April 1933 letter to his brother A.Y.

He currently lives in Pendleton, South Carolina.  Life  Burnside was born on November 29, 1944 in Baltimore, Maryland, but moved to South Carolina when he was five years old. He attended Sterling high School in Greenville, South Carolina. He held many jobs throughout his life including seven years working at the S&H; Green Stamp store in Greenville, a seven year stint in the U.S. military, and later as a hotel chef in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Conn in 1948 Harold Joel Conn (May 29, 1886 ‚Äì November 10, 1975) was an American agricultural bacteriologist, known for his work on soil microbiology and bacterial staining techniques. He was one of the founders of the Biological Stain Commission and also founded their journal, Stain Technology (now Biotechnic & Histochemistry). He served as President of the Society of American Bacteriologists (now the American Society for Microbiology) in 1948. Early life and education Conn was born in Middletown, Connecticut in 1886. His parents were the bacteriologist Herbert William Conn (1859‚Äì1917), one of the founders of the Society of American Bacteriologists, and his wife, Julia M. Joel. He had one sister, Bertha. Conn started to experience progressive hearing loss as a child of 12; he describes his father as having encouraged him to overcome the challenges posed by his deafness. He attended Wesleyan University, where his father had started an early course in bacteriology, gaining a doctorate in 1908, despite being obliged by his deafness to copy another student's lecture notes. He went on to pursue a second PhD in the relatively new discipline of soil bacteriology at the New York State School of Agriculture, Cornell University, under the direction of T. L. Lyon, who specialized in agricultural science rather than bacteriology. He completed this PhD in 1911; his thesis is entitled \\"A study of seasonal variation among the bacteria in two soil plats of unequal fertility\\". Conn showed that soil bacteria can sometimes increase when the soil is frozen; the counterintuitive result led to considerable discussion in the scientific community. Career, research and societies In 1911, Conn joined the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York as an associate bacteriologist. He spent his entire career at the station, which became part of Cornell University, being appointed chief in research in 1920 and, in addition, professor of bacteriology in 1945. He initially worked under H. A. Harding, a dairy bacteriologist, and from 1913 under Robert S. Breed. Conn retired from the station in 1948. Conn's research at the station continued his PhD investigations on soil bacteria. He invented a technique to stain bacteria so that they could be studied under the light microscope, and from around 1920, staining techniques became his main research focus, to the extent that he was sometimes called \\"Dr. Stain\\". In November 1921, he founded the precursor to the American Biological Stain Commission with Rolland T. Will, C. E. McClung, S. I. Kornhauser and L. W. Sharp, and served as one of its founding executive committee members and later its chairman. The commission tested bacteriological and histochemical stains from the fledgling American dye industry, brought into existence by the problems in acquiring stains from Germany after the First World War. From 1922, Conn supervised thirty assistants at the Agricultural Experiment Station in this work. He served as President of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1948, and also chaired the society's techniques committee. He was an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Writings and editorial work In 1920, Conn published Manual of Methods for Pure Culture Study of Bacteria, an influential work that was important in devising methods to classify bacteria. In 1923, he published a successful general textbook, Bacteriology; the text had been initiated by his father, who had died in 1917. He edited the Manual of Microbiological Methods (1957) and was a trustee of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1948‚Äì65). He also published several texts on staining including Biological Stains (1925), History of Staining (1933; 1948) and Staining Procedures (1944‚Äì55; 1960). According to the Biological Stain Commission, Biological Stains \\"has become a standard source of reference in technical and research histopathological and biological laboratories using dyes\\" and was brought out in a tenth edition in 2002. Conn founded the journal Stain Technology in 1926, serving as its founding editor for nearly 30 years, into his retirement. After his death, the journal's 52nd volume (1977) was dedicated to him. Conn published more than 200 journal articles, predominantly in the fields of soil microbiology and bacterial staining techniques. He wrote two biographies of his father, Herbert William Conn: one appears in Bacteriological Reviews and deals with the foundation of the Society of American Bacteriologists; the other unpublished text, \\"A Religious Scientist at the Turn of the Century\\", includes a bibliography. Other unpublished works include an autobiography and a history of the Biological Stain Commission (1955). His papers are archived at the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections of Cornell University Library. Personal life Conn's hearing loss was progressive throughout his life. Deafness significantly impaired his ability to communicate face to face with other scientists. He was little helped by hearing aids, and also had difficulties with lip reading. He was married; he and his wife had a son and a daughter, Jean, who also became a bacteriologist and was Conn's long-term assistant. She married the mycologist Vincent W. Cochrane, with whom she collaborated. Conn's wife died in 1963. Conn died in Geneva, New York, in 1975, aged 89.

L√©onide Lavinge is also considered a co-founder of the company. The company dissolved in 1951.  History  Financial support at the debut of the company was provided by L√©onide (Bobby) Lavinge, the father of Fran√ßois Lavinge, one of the original members of the company. Although his father did not support his son's choice of profession as an actor (and disinherited him for this reason), he still provided considerable financial support of the company. Among others, he bought the property and the farm which served as a rehearsal place for the company. According to his son, the building was cold and difficult to heat in the winter and the members of the company did not like those conditions. L√©onide would eventually sell the property, which was later purchased by F√©lix Leclerc for his home residence. The property is now a Quebec cultural heritage site. At the funeral of Fran√ßois Lavinge in Montr√©al in 1989, √âmilie Legault made the eulogy. In the early history of the company, it favoured the principle of strictly religious performances, but later adopted a more national approach. The company travelled across Quebec and would give, for many people, the first theatrical experience of their lives. To do this, the group often performed in venues that did not look like rooms, such as fire stations. The company had the distinction of having brought a new cultural dimension to ensemble in Quebec, breaking up the monopoly held by Montreal until then. The performances of the company were well received by critics and the public. The company received the troph√©e Bessbourough for the best theatre company in Canada, affirming the cultural vocation of the college, it had to relocate several times to larger venues to accommodate larger audiences and larger productions. The company was a part of the Coll√®ge de Saint-Laurent from 1938 until 1942, then at L'Ermitage from 1942 to 1945, then at the Church of the Ges√π (Montreal) from 1945 to 1948 and finally at the Th√©√¢tre des Compagnons from 1948 to 1952.

It is the seat for the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Our Lady of Nareg in the United States of America and Canada. History In the 19th century Catholic Armenians from Western Armenia, mainly from the towns and cities of Karin (Erzurum), Constantinople, Mardin etc., came to the United States seeking employment. At the end of the same century, many survivors of the Hamidian Massacres had concentrated in several U.S. cities, chiefly in New York. Catholic Armenian communities were also founded in New Jersey, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, and other cities of California. Catholic Armenian educational organizations were also founded in many cities. In Philadelphia and Boston Colleges of Armenian sisters were founded, educating hundreds of children. Later, a similar college was founded in Los Angeles. Mechitarists were preoccupied with the problem of preserving Armenian identity. By the effort of Mekhitarists in Venice and Vienna, the Mkhitarian College was founded in Los Angeles. Many Armenians came to the United States and Canada from the Middle Eastern countries of Lebanon and Syria in the 1970s and in later years. Also many Armenians immigrated from Argentina, because of the economic crisis. At the same time, many Catholic Armenians inside the United States moved to San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami and Indianapolis. Rev. Rapha√´l Minassian was appointed to the mission in Los Angeles in 1989, taking up residence at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs. He began to plan a new church in Glendale. Minassian acquired a Lutheran church on Mountain Street in 1997. The building was renovated so the Armenian rite liturgy could be celebrated. The Armenian style altar was created by Fathers Raphael and Dajad Yardemian. St. Gregory the Illuminator parish was established in 1998 and Minassian left Our Lady Queen of Martyrs. The old church was torn down to make way for a new church. The cornerstone for the present church was laid on August 15, 1999. It was designed in the traditional Armenian style and took two years to construct. The property includes a monument commemorating the seventeen centuries of Armenian Christianity. It features the names of all the sponsors and benefactors of the parish. Bishop Manuel Batakian, the Exarch of Armenian Catholics in the United States and Canada, consecrated the church on March 18, 2001. The monument commemorating the 17 centuries of Armenian Christianity. Minassian left St. Gregory's in 2004 and was replaced by Rev. Andon Noradounkian who had come to the parish the year before as assistant pastor. The following year he was replaced by Rev. Andon Saroyan. In 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI's decision, the Catholic Exarchate of the USA and Canada was advanced to the status of a diocese. It serviced 35,000 Catholic Armenians in the United States and some 10,000 in Canada. The bishop, or eparch, of the diocese, which has jurisdiction over Canadian and American Catholics who are members of the Armenian Catholic Church, became Manuel Batakian. According to a Monday, May 23, 2011 news release by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Pope Benedict XVI, named Archpriest Mika√´l Antoine Mouradian, superior of the Convent of Notre Dame in Bzommar, Lebanon, as the new bishop of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Nareg in New York for Armenian Catholics. The appointment of Lebanon-born Bishop Mouradian was publicized in Washington, May 21, by Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. In 2012, the eparchy moved from New York City to Glendale, California. The church in New York was being sold and while the eparchy was offered a new church, the bishop decided to move the eparchy to Glendale since there were more Armenian Catholic families in the area than in New York.

Koshe (alternatively spelled Quoshee or Repi), derived from the Amharic word for \\"dirty,\\" had hundreds of people living in unincorporated communities beneath the 50 year-old garbage dump's unstable mounds. Both shanty houses and concrete structures were built in Koshe by residents attracted to the area's cheap cost-of-living and availability of recyclables to collect for income. Destabilized by constant human interaction, a segment of one of the garbage mounds collapsed during the evening onto one of Koshe's communities. Landslide The landslide occurred Saturday evening at 20:00 as many people were inside of their homes. A large garbage mound collapsed onto a neighborhood of about 150 people, sliding into the community with enough force destroy brick and concrete structures as well as shanty houses. Garbage landslides are particularly deadly because buried victims are often quickly suffocated by landfill gases like methane and carbon dioxide, in addition to temperatures within decomposing mounds easily reaching 140 ¬∞F (60 ¬∞C) or higher. Six excavators were hired by authorities to clear away rubble in the search for survivors or victims Emergency officials rescued 37 people in the immediate aftermath of the landslide, but struggled to reach dozens more buried beneath the black dirt and debris. Despite the inhospitable environment, another man was rescued from beneath the collapsed mound two days after the slide. Officials redeployed excavators from across Addis Ababa to help search efforts. The garbage landslide killed at least 115 people and left dozens of others missing. Speculation by locals in the immediate aftermath blamed the landslides on new garbage dumping in the area after a several-year cessation, and bulldozers used in construction of a nearby biogas plant for packing down and shaking the area's dirt, possibly destabilizing the garbage mounds in the process.  Government Response  The response to the landslide by Ethiopia's government underscored public outrage over the impoverished conditions of Koshe, prompting policy changes in housing and construction. Ethiopia's Communications Minister Negeri Lencho announced the creation of investigative committee had been created to determine the cause of the landslide. 56 families were moved to temporary government housing in Koshe's Nifas Silk Sub-City and Kolfe Keranio Sub-City as part of resettlement efforts with plans to eventually permanently resettle them. Additionally, plans were made to convert the disaster site into an open-air park. But Koshe's makeshift communities remained populated when another landslide struck in June 2019, killing an elderly man.

Louis Oppenstein became the head of his family at the age of 14. Louis was able to employ his brothers as they came of age, and by 1898 the group was able to operate a much larger store in Denver. In 1902 the brothers moved from Denver to Kansas City, Missouri, where they purchased the Herman Streicher Watch and Jewelry Company at 1017 Main Street. The shop became quite a success, and Louis was able to invest in Kansas City real estate. In 1919 the brothers purchased the Navarro building in Kansas City. The brothers, though quite wealthy, were publicly modest; they used their wealth to help support various communities in Kansas City, including its Jewish community. Louis Oppenstein died at age 63 from a heart attack; his funeral drew over 1,000 attendees. His three surviving brothers who sold the jewelry business after Louis' death and eventually the proceeds were used to form the Oppenstein Brothers Foundation which was established in 1941. Louis Oppenstein's generosity was summed up in his obituary: \\"He responded eagerly to those in distress and despair, and to every call of philanthropy.

Completed in 1927, the building's grand opening as The Campbell's Department Store took place on March 9, 1928. The building is significant for its type of brick and steel construction, finishing, unique craftsmanship, and history with local families. The building was rehabilitated between October 2015 and June 2018 History of Campbell Business alt= Prior to the grand opening of the final Campbell's Department Store, Reuben Edgar Campbell (1878-1955) married Ester Yelton. After working in a monazite mine, he built and operated a local general store. Later, Campbell opened a second general store in Shelby, where he lived above the retail operations in 1916. A 1917 newspaper reported that the store sold boys and men's clothing, trucks, gabs, shoes, millinery, dress goods, ladies and children's clothes, groceries, drugs, and furniture. He opened a third store on November 9, 1923, in nearby Lawndale, North Carolina, a thriving textile center. The building was owned by Campbell and J. Ogburn Lutz. These two men were highly successful in the retail trade, and in 1927 completed building their flagship store in Shelby, the fourth Campbell's Department Store. At this time they focused attention on this store and closed all of their other operations. At the time of construction, the building was among the tallest in Shelby, and used all local materials. Grand opening The Campbell Building was immediately emblematic of local craftsmanship and a source of pride for every Shelbian who contributed work on the project. At its opening the Cleveland Star noted in an article on March 7, 1928 that the Bostic Brick Company of Bostic, North Carolina provided all of the brick. Eighty tons of structural steel was manufactured and used in the building by J.C. Weathers of Shelby, North Carolina; and the millwork for the flooring, stairs, and show windows were completed by A.J. Thompson of Shelby. The 30,000 square foot, five-level building was a full service department store selling groceries, bedding, hats, yard goods, footwear, furniture, appliances, farm supplies, toys, caskets, and clothing for women, men, and children. There was also a beloved bargain basement. For many years, a camel, Campbell's trademark, was painted on the exposed south side of the building. This billboard-like emblem has now disappeared from the brick. Campbell's was known locally for its elaborately ornamented pressed tin ceilings and mezzanine lunchroom. Many Cleveland County locals still recall the Campbell department store. One local woman said, \\"You'd walk up those stairs to the second floor and take a right, and you'd see the most beautiful Sunday dresses in the world!\\" Shelby in the late 1920s At the time that Campbell's opened their big store in 1927, Shelby was thriving economically. The town was accessible by railroad, close to Charlotte, North Carolina, and served as a center for trade for the booming textile industries throughout Cleveland and Mecklenburg counties. By 1930, the population of Shelby had grown to 12,000 people. The town was \\"the leading shopping center between Charlotte and Asheville\\". By 1935, State Highway 20 had been completed which allowed for a bus service to the town. A new High School was scheduled to be built at the cost of $150,000. There were over eight churches, a public library, a modern hospital, and electricity and water systems in place and many Federal improvement programs were underway. In 1929, the earliest Shelby city directory available after Campbell's was opened, noted that other stores in operation included Efird's, Paragon, Montgomery Ward, J.C. Penney, A.V. Wray & 6 Sons, Carolina Stores, Charles Stores, Acorn, Haines, Ingram-Liles, and McNeely and Company. All of them, except for Campbell's and A.V. Wray, were part of much larger department store chains. Of the remaining buildings, only Campbell's and Efird's retain their original architecture and a high degree of integrity on their exterior. Present day alt= Although the Campbell Department Store closed in 1950, the building stayed in the same family, later becoming a furniture store for 25 years, a restaurant, and then sitting dormant for 12 years. In 2014, a Shelby family became the second family to own the Campbell Building. Preservation of the historic elements of the building was important to the Franklin family; therefore, they spent three full years rehabilitating the building before reopening it to the community. The Campbell Building retains a high degree of architectural integrity even today. At over 30,000 square feet in size, the building preserves extensive features on its interior, including its original mezzanine and railing overlooking the first floor, tin ceilings on all levels, wood floors, and most significantly, the original grand wooden staircase which extended from the ground floor all the way to the third floor. An 800 square foot rooftop terrace was added to the building making it the tallest rooftop terrace between Charlotte and Asheville, NC. After completing their work, the Franklin family opened an event venue, Uptown Indigo, on the second and third floors as well as the rooftop. The first floor and mezzanine is home to the Greenbrook Design Center. The Historic Campbell building is a member of the Central Shelby Historic District.

He has written op-eds for G√∂teborgsposten, Hallandsposten and Svenska Dagbladet. Arpi supports freedom of speech and believes that pluralism of opinion is important for society to develop.  Politics  Arpi grew up in a left-wing area in Majorna, Gothenburg. He called himself communist but turned right-wing after becoming skeptical of the Swedish left wing ideology doctrine that all oppression could be singled down to gender oppression, class oppression and racism. For this change he received much criticism. In an interview with Sveriges Radio he has stated that gender ideology is taking over the Swedish universities. Vetenskapsr√•det criticized his stand. He has also criticized the demographic changes in Sweden which he was criticized for by Per Svensson of Dagens Nyheter. In 2016, Arpi published an article in Svenska Dagbladet criticizing transactivists for claiming \\"veto on the truth\\". Arpi has also been criticized for proposing a more strict asylum and migration politics. During the election of 2018 Arpi stated that one party leader would have to disappoint their voters. He has also criticized the United Nations critique to Sweden for allowing \\"organizations who support hate groups\\".  Globalism and nationalism  Ivar Arpi is a strong opponent of globalism and has debated with reporters from Expressen who claimed his stand was \\"inappropriate\\". Arpi has stated that \\"the EU was invented for Europeans, not in order to take on asylum seekers\\". He has also supported Polands and Hungarys restricted migration policy and border customs. Arpi has also stated that the EU is tyrannical in its forcing of mass-migration.

The model achieved a good sales success, and had the highest production of any machine from MV Agusta. Many brought the bike as the only means of family transport or as a work vehicle. Despite the questionable aesthetics, the Pullman offered a comfortable ride, derived by the driving position, soft suspension and large section tires. This was particularly appreciated by users, so much so that they were imitated by some competitors. 27,000 machines of this model series were produced. The model was also produced under licence in Spain by Avello, where it was marketed as the MV Avello 125 Pullman Turismo. Background At the beginning of the fifties, the motorcycle manufacturers tried to counter the rampant success of scooters produced by Piaggio and Innocenti by creating utility motorcycle that offered good versatility and practicality of use, overcoming the serious stability problems of the scooter, due to the small diameter of its wheels. Following the lead of Moto Guzzi who, in 1950, had put the Galletto into production, other motorcycle manufacturers ventured into the construction of hybrid models, such as the Sterzi Confort and Motom Delfino. Series 1 Unveiled at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1953, the \\"Pullman\\" stood out for its rather original appearance. The cycle parts apparently stretched by the effect of the engine in a very rearward position with the rear suspension mounted on it. The engine was a unit construction, The engine was an air-cooled single-cylinder two-stroke with a bore and stroke of 53 √ó 56 mm giving a displacement 123.5 cc. These dimensions were the same as the previous Motore Lungo model. Compression ratio was 6:1, and the engine was fed by a Dell'Orto MA17 carburetor. Ignition was by a flywheel magneto. A Wet multi-plate clutch was driven by gears from the crankshaft, and a three- speed gearbox was fitted, which was controlled by a twist grip. Drive to the rear wheel was by chain. The MV Agusta had an open cradle frame, made of steel tube, similar in shape to that of MV's \\"125 Ovunque\\" scooter, which itself was modelled on the successful \\"Lambretta 125 C\\" of 1950. Attached to the gearbox was the swinging arm, with an undamped shock absorber each side. Additionally a hydraulic central shock absorber was fitted. The machine was fitted with telescopic forks and 130 mm drum brakes. Rider comfort was enhanced by foot plates rather than the usual footrests, a single saddle and wide, for its class, 3,50 x 15 tyres. A rack was fitted above the rear mudguard. The position of the engine created an unusual gap between the front wheel and the downtube of the frame that could be fitted with an optional sheet metal fairing, which could be used as a storage compartment. Priced between 155,000 to 163,000 Lira, dependent on options, sales of the model were good and helped MV Augusta to achieve and annual production of over 20,000 units. Series 2 The second series of the Pullman introduced in 1954. Apart from cosmetic changes, the twist grip gearchange was replaced by a conventional foot change. The rear shock absorbers were changed to hydraulically damped units, and the now redundant third shock absorber omitted. Production of this model stopped in 1956. Super Pullman In 1955 the Pullman was joined by the \\"Super Pullman\\" model. This model was intended to look more like a \\"normal\\" motorcycle. A sheet metal beam frame was used. The frame was pressed in two halves that were electrowelded together. Earles forks and more conventionally sized 18\\" wheels were fitted. Engine power was increased to 6 bhp @ 5,200 rpm. The last machines produced in 1957 were used to test a prototype fuel injection 125 cm¬≥ two-stroke engine which, due to the crisis in the motorcycle sector following the marketing of the Fiat 500, did not go into production. Production of the Super Pullman ceased in 1958, after approximately 3,000 machines had been made.

Mainzer Arch√§ologische Schriften (herausgegeben von der Generaldirektion Kulturelles Erbe Rheinland-Pfalz, Direktion Landesarch√§ologie Mainz), Bd. 9, Mainz 2012, The temple was founded during the 1st century and active until at least the 3rd century. Since 1999, substantial excavations have been made on the site.Sanctuary of Isis & Mater Magna During construction work of a shopping gallery later named \\"R√∂merpassage\\" in the city centre of Mainz, its structural remains were discovered and uncovered at the end of 1999. Consecration inscriptions prove the connection between the Flavian imperial house and the erection of the sanctuary and suggest a possible connection between the foundation of the sanctuary and a politically explosive reason for the consecration. The remains of the building, selected finds, and a multimedia framework presentation can be viewed in the form of a small museum in the basement of the R√∂merpassage.  Historical background  Remains of the sanctuary (Taberna archaeologica, Mainz) In the year 13/12 B.C. the Roman history of Mainz, which lasted almost 500 years, began with the construction of a legion camp on the Mainz K√§strich, a hill above the Rhine valley. The rapidly developing Canaba, the civil vicus towards the Rhine and the public buildings of the later provincial capital, such as thermal baths, theatres, administrative buildings and temples, followed quickly, especially under the Flavian dynasty. During this time, the temple complex for Isis and Magna Mater was built. In the sanctuary in Mogontiacum both Isis ‚Äì here with the additions Panthea ('Allgoddess') and Regina ('Queen') ‚Äì and the mother god Magna Mater were worshipped according to the found inscriptions. Both goddesses were most probably introduced by the Roman army in Mainz, who brought their religion with them, in the context of the expansion of the Roman empire. The cult of Isis originates from Egypt, the deity Mater Magna goes back at least to the small Asian goddess Kybele (see Isis- and Osiris cult and Kybele- and Attis cult). Both cults already had a longer tradition in the Roman Empire: Kybele/Mater Magna had been worshipped in Rome since the end of the 3rd century BC. Isis had long been part of the pantheon in the Egyptian pharaonic empire. Through the Ptolemies and the Hellenistic culture, the Roman world also came into contact with the Isis cult. In the Roman republic and at the beginning of the imperial period up to Tiberius partly forbidden, the Isis cult finally established itself under Emperor Caligula. In the new province of Germania superior with its provincial capital Mogontiacum, however, these cults were new. Since the founder of the Flavian imperial house, Emperor Vespasian, had received his destiny of rule in Alexandria from the Egyptian deity Serapis, the Flaviers had a close connection to oriental cults. The Egyptian goddess Isis was a representative of the imperial cult, comparable to the position of Venus in the Julian imperial house. In this context, bricks with military brick stamps found on site suggest that a building had been erected on behalf of the Emperor for the purpose of cult practice promoted by the Emperor. The sanctuary was fundamentally rebuilt several times over the next 200 years and, after the first city wall was built around 250, was also located within the protected city area. Towards the end of the 3rd century AD, perhaps even later, the cult of Isis and Mater Magna was no longer practiced in Mainz. The sanctuary was abandoned and the building complex fell into disrepair. Concrete reasons for the cessation of cult activities are not known. Datable finds are mainly from the 1st and 2nd centuries and prove the active use of the sanctuary during this period. It is possible that the further processing of the extensive find material may enable a more precise dating of the useful life of the sanctuary. Due to its peripheral location in early medieval Mainz, the site probably lay fallow for some time. Beginning with the construction of the monastery of the Poor Clares after 1330 and the construction of the Wamboldt court in a similar time frame, the site was built over with monastery complexes and patrician courts in the Middle Ages.  Rediscovery, excavation and rescue  In 1999 one of the last inner-city areas with buildings from the 1950s was to be upgraded. In order to build a shopping arcade, the existing buildings were demolished and a correspondingly large excavation pit was dug for the foundations. The construction project was accompanied by the General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate. Since the Roman road in this area ran from the legionary camp towards the Rhine bridge (parts of which were uncovered during the excavations), the archaeologists involved reckoned with a typical strip house development and smaller workshops from Roman times. At a depth of five metres at the end of 1999, two archaeologically important finds were unexpectedly discovered: the remains of a sanctuary from the Roman period and an underlying burial site from the Hallstatt period that was around 700 years older. During the subsequent archaeological excavations, both the building complex of the sanctuary and a women's grave of the Hallstatt burial ground dated 680-650 BC were documented. The excavations lasted about 17 months and ended at the beginning of 2001. Fifteen tons of soil were removed from the excavation site for further archaeobotanical and archaeozoological evaluation, in addition to 49 m¬≥ of other recovered finds. Initially, it was planned to remove the structural remains according to the archaeological documentation and to continue with the construction work for the shopping arcade. The Mithr√§um at Ballplatz, which was discovered in the 1970s and also dates back to the 1st century, suffered a similar fate. It was irretrievably destroyed during the construction work - insufficiently documented. Resistance against these plans formed among the population of Mainz and a newly founded citizens' initiative, the Initiative R√∂misches Mainz, collected several 10,000 signatures for the preservation of the sanctuary within a short time. This achieved a permanent conservation of the sanctuary and its inclusion in the newly built shopping arcade. Due to the planned construction of an underground car park at this location, however, the finds had to be translocated. The structural remains of the sanctuary were dismantled in a complex procedure and moved several metres. The resulting costs of 3.43 million euros were shared between the city of Mainz and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Since the festive opening on 30 August 2003 - an estimated 25,000 visitors came to the Mainz city centre for the festival ‚Äì the sanctuary of Isis and Mater Magna can be visited in the so-called Taberna archaeologica in the basement of the R√∂merpassage Mainz.

The Genesis limousines were used after the inauguration of Moon. The former state Hyundai Equus vehicle was built and developed in South Korea and was part of a highly classified project. At the time of its production, it was the first and only armored stretched limousine built entirely in South Korea. As of 2019 the current Presidential state car is a Hyundai Nexo SUV used by President Moon Jae-in. He chose the Nexo for its eco friendly build and to create an incentive to the Korean people to use more eco friendly vehicles in South Korea. Also, It is the first FCEV state car around the world.  Previous generations  The 1992 Cadillac that served as the former Presidential state car of South Korea with the Presidential seal on the license plate President Roh Moo-hyun rode in an armoured BMW E65 Security 760Li purchased in 2005 and a 2002-model Mercedes-Benz W220 S600 Guard. Roh used the W220 during peace talks with North Korea. The presidential motorcade was escorted by Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion, also with several identical Mercedes-Benz W220s. It is believed that Blue House prefers to use the Mercedes vehicles instead of the Genesis in talks with North Korea to present a neutral brand that is also favored by North Korea. The late president Kim Dae-jung used an armored BMW E38 Security 760Li, offered by BMW Korea, for his state visit to Mongolia in June 1999, while presidents Rhee, Yun, Park, and Chun used successive models of Cadillac Fleetwood limousines.

They also sit in the passenger side to not only do their duty but if somehow the motorcade is attacked, their job is to fire at the belligerent and neutralize them immediately. The gas tank is also non- explosive as there is a special foam that prevents the gas tank from exploding. There are always spare tires and parts in the motorcade in case of immediate repairs or tire changes.

Biography Graduated in law at the University of Florence in 1966, Ferri has been a magistrate since 1970 and since 1971 a praetor in Pontremoli. He was a member of the Superior Council of the Judiciary from 1976 to 1981, when he became National Secretary of the Independent Judiciary (1981‚àí1987). From 1988 to 1989 he served as Minister of Publick Works in the De Mita Cabinet and is known for having set the limit of 110 km/h on the highway. In 1989 he was elected MEP for the PSDI and in 1992 he was elected Deputy in the National Parliament. In 1990 he was also elected Mayor of Pontremoli (he held office until 2004). On 30 April 1993 he was appointed Secretary of the PSDIL' EX MINISTRO ENRICO FERRI E' IL NUOVO SEGRETARIO DEL PSDI. In 1994 he was newly elected MEP for his party. In 1995 he was also re- elected Mayor of Pontremoli, with the support of Forza Italia and National Alliance. This led to further fractures within the party and the official expulsion by the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists, to which the PSDI and Ferri adhered. Ferri was thus forced to leave the party secretariat. On 10 December 1994, together with Luigi Preti, he founded the European Liberal Social Democracy (SOLE). In January 1995 a PSDI congress definitively put the current of Ferri and Preti into the minority, appointing Gian Franco Schietroma as party secretary. In 1995 the SOLE movement became an autonomous party and approached the centre-right area, forging a privileged collaboration with the Christian Democratic Centre. Luigi Preti, not in favor of this choice, detached himself from the SOLE by creating the Movement for the Social Democratic Rebirth, a political subject federated with Forza Italia. At the 1996 general elections, Ferri was a candidate on the White Flower lists, without however being elected. In 1998 Ferri left the CCD (of which he became vice president in 1997-98) and followed Clemente Mastella into the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR) of Francesco Cossiga. However he soon left the party to join Forza Italia in 1999, resuming relations with Luigi Preti. In the 1999 European Parliament elections he ran with Forza Italia and was elected MEP, where he remained until 2004. On the occasion of the 2006 general elections, he returned to the centre-left area, joining the Union of Democrats for Europe of Clemente Mastella, but he was not elected. So he returned to the judiciary as Deputy Prosecutor General of the Cassation. With the appointment of Mastella as Minister of Justice, he was appointed head of the International Activities Coordination Office (UCAI) at the same Ministry of Justice, a position he held until the fall of the Prodi government in January 2008. Personal life Enrico Ferri is the father of four children: the eldest son, Filippo, was head of the Florence Police mobile team, before being definitively sentenced to three years and eight months for the violence in the Diaz school in 2001 during the G8 in Genoa; the second son, Jacopo, has been a regional councillor in Tuscany for Forza Italia; the third son, Cosimo Maria Ferri, is a former Undersecretary and a parliamentary Deputy for the Democratic Party; the fourth daughter, Camilla, works as a pharmacist at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan.

It became Wayne and Shuster's signature sketch, and both its television and radio recordings have been preserved as significant works. History \\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\\" was created to poke fun at the hoopla surrounding the Stratford Festival, a Shakespearean festival founded in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, in 1953. Like other works by Wayne and Shuster, the sketch assumes knowledge of the classics, in this case the plays Hamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar, and Richard III. In preparation for the sketch, the comedians read most of Shakespeare's plays and went to the Stratford Festival, the American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Connecticut, and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Wayne crafted the iambic pentameter for the sketch. Modal Elizabethan music was composed for the sketch by the comedy duo's arranger, Johnny Dobson. The sketch was first performed on television on May 22, 1958, closing The Wayne & Shuster Hours 1957‚Äì58 season with CBC Television. It was then performed on US television on June 1, on their third appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which they emceed while Sullivan was in Europe. The duo had been scheduled to perform game-show parody \\"The $64,000 Squeal\\", and had a heated argument over switching to \\"Shakespearean Baseball\\". Wayne was concerned that the new sketch wasn't yet ready for the US, while Shuster felt it was worth the risk to make a bigger impact and help attract additional job offers as their CBC contract had expired. The show was seen by an estimated 40 million viewers in the US and Canada. The sketch was performed for CBC Radio on June 18, 1959. This recording was among the Wayne and Shuster works restored and preserved in 2000 by the Masterworks program of National Archives Canada. The sketch was included on the duo's first comedy album, Wayne and Shuster: In Person Comedy Performance, in 1960. In 1971, the comedians slightly revised the script and re-broadcast the sketch on colour television. In 1977, the comedians produced a third version in honour of the formation of the Toronto Blue Jays. Description The setting for the sketch is \\"Bosworth Field (A Baseball Stadium Near Stratford)\\", an allusion to the site of the final battle in Richard III. That play was the first to be staged by the Stratford Festival in its 1953 debut season. The sketch incorporates 33 quotations and puns from Shakespearean plays, along with visual slapstick. Characters speak their lines in blank verse, with the poetic metering of iambic pentameter. The sketch runs 10 to 11 minutes. The main roles are the team's manager and catcher, in parodies of Horatio and Hamlet, with 11 supporting roles. Shuster plays the manager of the fictional Stratford team, while Wayne plays the team's catcher, a slugger who has not had a hit in ten games. The catcher mopes in the locker room and soliloquizes in the manner of Hamlet, \\"Oh, what a rogue and bush league slob am I, who has ten days hitless gone.\\" With the Stratford team down 1‚Äì0 in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs, the catcher is next at bat. Unlike \\"Casey at the Bat\\", to which it has been compared, \\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\\" ends with the would-be hero being hit by a pitch in the head, becoming delirious, and ultimately being carried off the field. His manager vows, \\"No longer would Stratford see Yogi play ball, I'm trading the bum to Montreal\\". In the 1977 version, the manager was named \\"The Mighty Thurman\\", the starting pitcher was called \\"Catfish\\", and the relief pitcher was dubbed \\"Sparky\\", incorporating names of baseball stars of that era. Reception The sketch was well received on its 1958 premieres on Canadian and US television. Arthur Brydon of The Globe and Mail called it \\"some of the cleverest Wayne and Shuster comedy of the season\\", and that it was suitable for Sullivan. William Drylie of the Toronto Daily Star wrote that the sketch was \\"one riot followed by another\\" in one of their strongest shows, and agreed that it was ready for Sullivan. Following the sketch's US debut on The Ed Sullivan Show, Variety reported that the duo were \\"the freshest comedy team extant\\" and suggested that Sullivan's show be renamed after them. There was considerable speculation that Wayne and Shuster might have permanently moved to New York, as their CBC contract had expired and their hosting Sullivan was a great success. On June 13, 1958, they signed a new contract with CBC which made them the highest-paid performers in Canadian television. Retrospectives \\"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\\" is considered Wayne and Shuster's signature sketch. In a CBC interview, the duo noted the sketch's initial performances as the height of their career. The sketch is included in The Wayne & Shuster Years, a 75-minute retrospective of their 50+ year career, broadcast on CBC Television on February 24, 1991, and released on home video on May 28, 1996. Hosting the special, Shuster introduces the sketch as \\"our personal best\\". The original television recording was included in Wayne and Shuster in Black and White, a retrospective series of 22 half-hour episodes, edited from the CBC archives by Shuster and broadcast on CBC Television in 1996. The Toronto Star rated that series 5 out of 5 and called the sketch a \\"grand takeoff\\" and \\"wonderful moments to savor\\". In 2002, John McKay of The Canadian Press wrote that the sketch remains \\"deceptively sophisticated\\". Legacy For decades, English teachers requested copies of the sketch for their classes. In the form of a short play, the sketch has been staged theatrically at the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory as part of the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, the Toronto Jewish Film Festival, and at numerous other theatre festivals and events. According to the Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project at the University of Guelph, the sketch influenced later sports comedy parodies of Shakespeare by Chris Coculuzzi and Matt Toner in \\"Shakespeare's Rugby Wars\\" (2001) and \\"Shakespeare's World Cup\\" (2002).

The film stars Rajasekhar,Rahul Ramakrishna,Adah Sharma, Nandita Swetha and Pujita Ponnada in the lead roles. Plot This plot begins in 1983 in Kollapur at United Andhra Pradesh. The story begins with a conversation regarding Kollapur rajmahal between a local of Kollapur and Deva Dutta (Rahul Ramakrishna), a reporter. Opposing the incorporation of independent kingdoms in the Indian Union, the Nizam of Hyderabad sends the Razakars to destroy Hindu provinces, temples and wealth. Raja Balakishan Rao, the king of Kollapur Province, has Raja ratnam (Nassar) as his confidante and Narsappa (Ashutosh Rana) as his commander in chief, gets killed at the Lord Narasimha Temple by Rajakars who entered kollapur with the help of Narsappa who has his eyes on the throne. After Nizam losing the war with the Indian Union, general elections are conducted in which Rani Ramachandramma wins inspite of the tactics played by Narsappa. With the help of Perumallu (Shatru)who is the son of Rajarathnam, Narsappa manages to destroy the palace of Rani Ramachandramma by looting the treasures and setting fire across the palace in which both Rani Ramachandramma and her son were killed. Then onwards Narsappa took control over Kollapur ruling Kollapur with his Iron fist. Meanwhile, at present fire takes place at a desi liquor store in which Deva Dutta finds that Sekhar Babu Siddu Jonnalagadda, younger brother of Narsappa is murdered. Then Narsappa believes his brother has been killed by Perumallu and begins a search for him. Afraid, Perumallu left his place and went underground. Unlike Narsappa, Sekhar Babu is an educated youth who heps the villagers. To investigate this case, the police department has appointed Kalki IPS Rajasekhar, a dashing police officer. Then Deva Dutta helps Kalki regarding the case. They come to know an incident that a murder attempt was done on Sekhar Babu earlier through a poisoned arrow. Then Kalki finds out that poison which is very rare and dangerous, he finds out the place called Nagulakona where the poison has been made but it was already destroyed by forest fire. After observing the place, Kalki understands that it's a man made fire. Meanwhile, Narsappa abducts a tribal girl called Paala Pitta to rape her, but she, tactically making reasons to stop him, escapes temporarily and became a maid in his home. Narsappa attacks Kalki by sending his henchmen by throwing molotov cocktail at him. During the treatment, Dutta observes there is a distance between Kalki and Dr. Padma who is the head doctor of the govt hospital. Later Kalki tells Dutta about their past relationship. In Kulumanali, when he used to work in CRPF they had met in a different situation. Later they become friends, it turns into love when Kalki decides to meet Padma's father for marriage proposal Kalki is transferred to Vikarabad to solve the Naxalites problem. Then in an operation, he kills a govt school teacher who is a Naxalite sympathizer giving shelter to Naxalites. He turns out to be Padma's father, then Padma misunderstands him and breaks up with him. After this story the investigation continues. Dutta finds out that Sekhar Babu has a friend called Asima Khan Nandita Swetha who villagers think they are in the relationship, he came to know that when Sekhar Babu had died the same day she shifted to the other place along with her father. Then Kalki and Dutta meet her father Kabir Khan who is an advocate. There he shares the relation between Sekhar Babu, i.e., Asima wants to start a boat business from Kollapur to Srisailam who has an intention to give employment for the villagers but the Muslim community people didn't accept her proposal because of their religious customs. But Sekhar Babu supports her and gives a positive stand. Then on their first trip all her boats have sunk suspiciously in the Krishna river. Thinking that Muslim community people are behind this act, Kabir becomes silent and decides to shift from the place, it is a coincidence that it's the same day of Sekhar Babu's death. After hearing this information through one of Kabir's servants, Narsappa becomes angry and tries to kill Asima, then Kalki came to her rescue and suspects Narsappa of murdering Sekhar Babu, because Sekhar Babu is his stepbrother, owing to jealousy due to the rising popularity of Sekhar Babu. Then Narsappa backs off without any reply. Later Kalki tells Dutta that he lied to stop him to save Asima from him. Meanwhile, Padma sees Kalki and Asima getting close and feels jealous. Asima tells Kalki that the boats have been sunk deliberately and created a lot of human loss. She knows the eyewitness of that incident, a Lord Hanuman devotee called Sambasivudu had not cooperated with her to tell truth in the court. She suggests to meet him, he may help them in the investigation. Sambasivudu approves what Asima said, but refuses to come to the court because he only helps him, but not to fight for him and encourages Kalki to investigate further. Then Dutta comes back to his cottage, observes the hotel receptionist acting suspicious, then he and Kalki follow him to the Sansthan's bungalow, which was abandoned after that fire which Perumallu has caused. All believe that a queen's ghost roams around the rajmahal, both find out that a man was the wine shop owner who hides his identity on fearing of Narsappa because before Sekhar Babu's death he met him with his friends and gave his diamond watch to him and bought the entire stock. After some time, the fire took place in the area Sekhar Babu has died at, then fearing for his life, the wine shop owner hid in the rajmahal with the help of the hotel receptionist. Then suddenly Kalki observes the portraits in rajmahal, he recognizes Sambasivudu as a trusted servant of the sansthan (Rajarathnam). Then both chase him, find out the hideout of Perumallu and catch them red handed. Sambasivudu confesses that he failed as a servant so he started living like a saint. But he didn't leave his loyalty to the sansthan, that's why he hides wounded Perumallu. Then Kalki, however, convinces them to come with them. In the forest suddenly some skeleton masked people attack them, Kalki successfully defeats all of them, in the chaos Sambasivudu dies saying everything is happening according to Karma not coincidence. Kalki arrests all the goons, then in govt hospital Padma treats the criminals who are familiar faces in the village including the servant in Kabir Khan's home. One of the goons puts a knife to Padma's neck and tries to escape. But Kalki saves Padma, killing him. Then Padma realises that her father's death was not intentional. On the same night, a person tries to kill Perumallu, but Kalki caught him and understands that he belongs to Nagulakona, he avenges on Perumallu and Narsappa for his people's death because they caused the fire and killed all of his people. That's why he tries to eliminate Narsappa along with his family so he tried to kill Shekhar Babu in a village function, unsuccessfully. Next morning, Perumallu escapes from the hospital. In the department meeting, Kalki submits his report and tells about his investigation. He observes that Sekhar Babu's murder was done because of sandalwood smuggling. When he observes in Nagulakona, he notices chopped sandalwood. Then he understands that Narsappa and Perumallu killed Nagulakona's people through fire and covers up because they are the only obstacle to their business. Later the same gang sunk the boats of Asima because if the population flow increases there will be no privacy for smuggling. Then Kalki arrests Narsappa at his home with the help of Paala pitta, who turns out to be Kalki's agent and an undercover cop. On the way, Perumallu attacks Narasappa and kills him, then in a shootout Kalki kills Perumallu. Finally the department closes Sekhar Babu's death case due to lack of suspects and finally, Dutta gets his promotion and fame for covering the entire incident. In the hospital, Asima meets Kalki along with Dutta, while they are talking, Padma sees them and tries to avoid the injured Kalki again. Asima stops her and tells a secret which she had never spoken. After the sinking of her boats she came to know through Sambasivudu that a gang is behind this, so she met Sekhar Babu privately at the wine shop which is located in the abandoned Lord Narasimha Swami temple. After knowing the facts, Sekhar Babu pressures her to tell the witness's name, but she doesn't want to, then Sekhar Babu reveals his real face and tells her that he is the one behind that act and he is the kingpin of the sandalwood smuggling who killed Nagulakona's people along with his brother and Perumallu. He sunk her boats to stop other people from the boat business. His aim is to get a good name among the people unlike Narsappa, stand for election in the near future and get overpowered. That's why he acts like a gentleman in the village then he orders his men to rape and kill Asima brutally and announces that he will use her death for a communal riot and then he makes this as an advantage to start his political career. After breaking up with Padma, depressed Kalki came to the same wine shop, came to the rescue of Asima and hangs Sekhar Babu and his men upside down. Sekhar Babu‚Äôs lighter falls out from his pocket and starts a fire which feeds the alcohol on the ground that they poured earlier to try to kill Asima. After revealing the secret, Asima tells Padma that Kalki is a god given brother to her like Lord Krishna to Draupadi. Padma and Kalki reconcile all conversation overheard by Deva Dutta, then he decides to tell the police about this, but later he notices that police are also involved in this issue, in fact, they send Kalki to kill Narsappa and Perumallu, which creates havoc in Kollapur and Kalki helps Perumallu to escape for taking shot on both of them. Later Kalki's mother came to see him then Dutta recognizes her as the wife of the zamindar, Rani Ramachandramma, then he understands that when Perumallu set fire to the rajmahal she managed to escape along with her son. Now Kalki unknowingly took vengeance on his father's death by killing Perumallu and Narsappa. Then he remembers Sambasivudu's words before his death that \\"\\". Like that all the people had paid their life for their misdeeds then Deva Dutta compares Kalki's actions with Lord Vishnu's Dashavatara. Finally, the film ends with Kalki discharged from the hospital and goes home along with his mother, Deva Dutta and Padma.

Early in her naval career, she saw combat in the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. After she was decommissioned, she was selected for conversion into the fuel oil barge YO-64, but she was lost in the early days of World War II in the Pacific before the conversion could be completed. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Wompatuck was completed in 1896 as the iron-hulled commercial screw tug Atlas for the Standard Oil Company of New York by Harlan and Hollingsworth at Wilmington, Delaware. Amid deteriorating relations with Spain in the spring of 1898, the U.S. Navy acquired Atlas from Standard Oil of New York on 4 April 1898. After refitting her for naval service at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, the Navy commissioned her there as USS Wompatuck on 6 April 1898 with Lieutenant Charles W. Jungen in command. Service history =Spanish-American War= Assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, Wompatuck departed New York City on 16 April 1898 and proceeded via Norfolk, Virginia; Port Royal, South Carolina; and Key West, Florida, to the Caribbean. During her journey, the Spanish-American War began on 25 April 1898, when the United States Congress declared was on Spain retroactive to 21 April. She arrived off Havana, Cuba, on 30 April 1898, bearing dispatches and mail for the ships of the North Atlantic Squadron blockading Cuba. Operations off southeast Cuba On 12 May 1898, Captain Charles P. Goodrich, the commanding officer of the auxiliary cruiser , embarked in Wompatuck with United States Marine Corps Lieutenant A. W. Catlin, eight U.S. Marines, and 11 volunteer U.S. Navy sailors. Wompatuck then headed for the mouth of the harbor at Santiago de Cuba on Cuba‚Ä≤s southeast coast to attempt to cut the undersea telegraph cable linking Cuba with Jamaica. Unluckily for the Americans, a Spanish patrol craft sighted them; and Goodrich ordered a hasty retirement, \\"not knowing what might be the resources of the defense in guns and search lights.\\" At daybreak on 18 May 1898, St. Louis and Wompatuck slowly closed the Santiago de Cuba harbor entrance in a second attempt to locate and destroy the cable. The St. Louis‚Ä≤s grapnel soon snagged on the telegraph cable; but, almost simultaneously, Spanish coastal artillery batteries opened fire on the two American warships. Although neither Wompatuck nor St. Louis was well-suited for a slugging match with coast defense batteries, both stayed on station until they had cut communications between Jamaica and Cuba. In his subsequent action report, Captain Goodrich lauded Lieutenant Jungen's \\"praise-worthy display of coolness and pluck in battle.\\" On 19 May 1898, St. Louis and Wompatuck attempted to cut Spanish cable connections at Guant√°namo Bay on Cuba‚Ä≤s southeast coast‚Ä≤. Wompatuck proceeded into the harbor and dragged her hook along the bottom while St. Louis lay-to outside, her main battery at the ready. Spanish shore batteries soon opened fire and eventually drove the American ships out to sea. After a brief period of repairs at Key West, Wompatuck returned to the blockade. She later took part in the landings of United States Army troops at Daiquir√≠ on Cuba‚Ä≤s southeast coast to relieve pressure on U.S. Marines entrenched at Guant√°namo Bay. During the Daiquir√≠ operation, Wompatuck screened U.S. Army transports on the voyage to the landing zone on 22 June 1898 and later towed 18 launches, whaleboats, and cutters towards the shore to help land the troops from the transports. After she had pointed the first landing parties toward the beaches, she shelled Spanish defense positions to prevent the Spanish defenders from launching a counterattack against the American force ashore. First Battle of Manzanillo On 30 June 1898, Wompatuck joined the gunboats and in reconnoitering the port of Manzanillo, Cuba. They encountered the Spanish 30-displacement ton gunboat Centinela near Niguero Bay; Wompatuck‚Ä≤s draft was too great for her to pursue Centinela as she retreated into shallow water near the coast, but Hist and Hornet followed her and, after they exchanged fire with Centinela and with Spanish troops on shore, Centinela‚Ä≤s crew beached her. The three American ships then proceeded to Manzanillo itself, where they found numerous merchant ships and six Spanish warships, the gunboats Cuba Espa√±ola, Delgado Parejo, Estrella, Guant√°namo, and Guardi√°n and the sailing vessel Maria; Cuba Espa√±ola, Guardi√°n, and Maria were functioning as immobile armed pontoons. Second in column, Wompatuck followed Hist‚Ä≤s lead and opened fire on the Spanish ships as soon as she reached firing range. The Spanish ships responded with an intense fusillade of their own. Wompatuck‚Ä≤s forward 3-pounder fired only seven rounds before the stress sheared off rivets at the base of the mount, rendering it useless,forcing Jungen to ordered her helm to be put over to starboard, causing Wompatuck to maneuver out of column formation but allowing her to bring her after battery to bear. Jungen reported that this permitted his vessel to maintain a \\"brisk...and well-directed\\" fire. A Spanish shell, meanwhile struck Hornet and severed a steam line. Escaping steam scalded three men, and least one of whom died. Wompatuck, seeing Hornet in distress, stopped, backed down, and passed Hornet a tow line which Wompatuck‚Ä≤s crew had laid out with foresight earlier that afternoon as she had cleared for action. After her first attempt to pull Hornet out of danger failed, Wompatuck came alongside to make certain that the towing hawser was securely fastened. Meanwhile, the Spanish had noticed that Hornet was disabled. The two-ship \\"nest\\" provided too good a target to pass up, and the Spaniards concentrated their gunfire on Wompatuck and Hornet. A \\"hot and uncomfortable\\" fire from cannon, mortars, and small arms soon fell around the two American warships. Wompatuck took three minor-caliber shell hits, one of which holed her port whaleboat and passed from Lieutenant Jungen. As the two American vessels crept out of danger, a sloop full of Spanish soldiers approached them from their disengaged side, hoping that the Americans were too busy to notice them. However, Hornet‚Ä≤s gunners sighted them and got off a well-placed 6-pounder shell which they reported sank the sloop. During the ensuing 55-minute duel, no ships ‚Äì except possibly the sloop ‚Äì were lost on either side, but the American ships claimed to have sunk a Spanish \\"torpedo boat.\\" After undergoing repairs, Wompatuck assisted Hist and Hornet in breaking Spanish undersea cables between Media Luna and Quizaro Island on 11 July 1898. Third Battle of Manzanillo One week later, on the morning of 18 July 1898, Wompatuck formed part of an American squadron that conducted a bold and devastating three-pronged raid on Manzanillo. The American warships, which also included Hist, Hornet, the gunboats and , the armed tug , and the armed yacht and were under the overall command of the commanding officer of Wilmington, Captain Chapman C. Todd,Naval History and Heritage Command \\"Naval Operations Manzanillo\\" approached the enemy from three directions through various shipping channels, with Helena and Wilmington attacking from the left by entering via a channel on the northern side of Manzanillo Bay, Osceola and Scorpion attacking via a central channel directly opposite the city, and Hist, Hornet, and Wompatuck approaching from the right through one of the southern entrance channels to the bay.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/07/22/102493236.pdf Anonymous, \\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships,\\" New York Times, July 22, 1898, p. 1. The three groups timed their passages so that would enter the bay simultaneously. The American squadron caught the Spanish by surprise, but at 07:04 Spanish coastal artillery batteries opened fire on the American ships.McKinley, William, The Abridgement, Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1899, p. 265 At about 07:19, Osceola and Scorpion commenced counterbattery fire against the Spanish coastal artillery. While Helena and Wilmington opened fire on the merchant steamers Gloria and Jose Garcia and the blockade runner Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n, several of the Spanish gunboats in the harbor ‚Äì Cuba Espa√±ola, Delgado Parejo, Estrella, Guant√°namo, and Guardi√°n ‚Äì steamed out to offer battle to the American ships but retreated back to their moorings under heavy fire.Everett, Marshall, Exciting Experiences in Our Wars with Spain and the Filipinos, Book Publishers Union, 1899, p. 142. Although forced to advance cautiously in the shallow waters of Manzanillo Bay to keep from running aground,Everett, Marshall, Exciting Experiences in Our Wars with Spain and the Filipinos, Book Publishers Union, 1899, p. 143. Hist, Hornet, and Wompatuck pursued the gunboats and engaged them at their moorings.McKinley, William, The Abridgement, Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1899, p. 263 Deciding that his ships were focusing too much of their attention on the merchant ships in the harbor and the hulk Maria, Todd ordered Helena to shift her fire from them to the gunboats, leaving it to Wilmington to finish off the merchant steamers. Helena systematically engaged the Spanish gunboats. Under fire by Helena, Hist, Hornet, and Wompatuck, three of these caught fire and exploded, one was beached and sank, and the fifth ran aground; the Americans assessed her as disabled, and her crew later removed her armor and scuttled her. With the entire Spanish flotilla at Manzanillo destroyed or disabled, Todd ordered the American ships to withdraw at 10:22 while Helena lay down suppressing fire, and battle was over at 10:35. The Americans emerged unscathed, but Wompatuck‚Ä≤s 3-pounder again had been put out of action when the rivets holding the base of its mount to the ship failed under the stress of firing. Following the Third Battle of Manzanillo, Wompatuck underwent repairs at Key West before returning to the waters off Cuba. The Spanish-American War came to an end on 13 August 1898. =Later career= Wompatuck departed Guant√°namo Bay on 14 August 1898, convoying the torpedo boat to Key West before proceeding north with the torpedo boat in tow and arriving at New York City on 26 August 1898. After repairs, Wompatuck proceeded on to Boston, Massachusetts, which she visited from 2 to 9 September 1898. After towing the monitor to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for decommissioning, Wompatuck returned to New York City on 15 September 1898 and was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 15 October 1898. Recommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 12 November 1900, Wompatuck departed New York City on 10 December 1900 and rendezvoused in Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the gunboat , the patrol yacht , and the tug . Underway for East Asia on 30 December 1900, the ships proceeded via the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, Colombo, and Singapore to the Philippines, arriving at Cavite on Luzon on 24 April 1901. Based at Cavite, Wompatuck spent the next few years participating in American military operations in the Philippine-American War, performing a wide variety of duties. She cooperated with U.S. Army units at Lubang, Tilig, and Luk Bay in the spring of 1901 and subsequently provisioned lighthouses at Kapones Island, Subig, and Olongapo; transported men and mail; and assisted vessels in distress. She carried out regular transportation services between Cavite and Olongapo into the spring of 1903 and later steamed to China to take part in the United States Asiatic Fleet's summer target practices at Chefoo. Assigned to the naval station at Cavite in 1904 and designated a \\"district harbor tug\\" with the hull classification symbol YT-27 on 17 July 1920, when the Navy adopted its modern, alphanumeric system of hull designations, Wompatuck performed harbor tug service until decommissioned on 31 July 1931. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 11 February 1938. Wompatuck apparently was laid up at Cavite for more than three years, awaiting disposal. However, she was withdrawn from the sale list on 9 July 1941 and selected for conversion into a self-propelled, diesel oil barge. She was reclassified as a \\"fuel oil barge\\" (YO) and renamed YO-64 on 9 October 1941, but her conversion apparently was incomplete when the Philippines fell to the Japanese in the early months of World War II in the Pacific. While no records have been found delineating her fate after war broke out in East Asia, it can be assumed that she was either captured by the Japanese when they took Cavite on 2 January 1942 or was scuttled by American or Filipino forces to prevent her capture. YO-64 was struck from the Navy list on 21 April 1944.

His selection came at a time after Ali had been charged with 19 counts of conspiracy and fraud by Guyana's Special Organized Crime Unit (SOCU). Ali's lawyers questioned the legality of these charges, and claimed that they were political in nature and \\"trumped up\\". At the time when Ali was running for president, the charges had never been brought to a full Court hearing. Immediately following his selection, Ali was accused of academic fraud, with opponents claiming that when Ali was in his early 20s, he had mis-represented one of his qualifications. Ali was also indicted on 19 charges of other fraud for allegedly defrauding the State of over $174M between the period 2011 and 2015, allegedly conspiring with persons unknown to \\"greatly undersell\\" 19 plots of state lands at Plantation Sparendaam and Goedverwagting in East Coast Demerara to current or former government officials. The trial on the matters was postponed several times. He was granted self bail on the charges. The lands, which were sold for $39.8M, are valued at $212.4M, according to the Special Organized Crime Unit (SOCU). On 14 August, the charges were dismissed. In the campaign for the Presidency, Ali ran on a mainly economic platform, citing declining growth and increased joblessness under the Granger Administration.

Production The design was built by Island Packet Yachts in the United States, with 178 examples completed between 1988 and 1994. It is now out of production. Design The Island Packet 35 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a cutter rig rig with anodized aluminum spars, a raked stem, a vertical transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel or optional long keel with a centerboard. It displaces and carries of ballast. The design features a platform-type bowsprit.

The galley is located on the starboard side and includes a three-burner gimballed liquid petroleum gas stove and oven, a double sink with pressurized hot and cold water and icebox. The head is located forward, just aft of the \\"V\\"-berth in the bow. Additional sleeping accommodation is provided by an aft private cabin with a double berth, plus the main saloon settees which convert to a single berth on the starboard side and a double on the port, for a total sleeping space for seven people. A navigation station is located on the port side of the cabin. The interior trim is teak with a holly cabin sole. Ventilation is provided by two opening ports and an overhead hatch in the aft cabin, a hatch and two opening ports in the bow cabin and a hatch and more opening ports in the main cabin. The cockpit has pedestal-mounted wheel steering, a coldwater shower and a separate icebox. The jib and boom-mounted staysail have furling systems, while the mainsail has a single-line reefing system. The mainsail is mid-boom sheeted to the cabin roof and has a mainsheet traveler. There are two mast-mounted halyard winches and two cockpit jib winches. The design features double backstays and an adjustable topping lift. Operational history In a review in 2000, yacht designer Robert Perry praised the style of the Island Packet 35 and wrote, \\"the Island Packet combines contemporary hull design with the forgiveness of a long keel to give the owner an easily handled yacht that takes care of itself with little helm assist. This is what a long keel boat should do.\\" A 2017 Spinsheet reviewer said, \\"I would characterize this design as a conservative, traditional cruiser that is likely to appeal to sailors more interested in comfort than speed made good to weather. The design has quite high freeboard and a high cabin trunk, but these features are disguised by a beautifully drawn sweeping sheerline and bowsprit, which make the boat look longer and lower than it really is ... For coastal cruising and livability aboard a 35-footer, this model has a lot to offer, and the prices reflect Island Packet‚Äôs popularity and reputation for solid construction.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *C&C; 34/36 *C&C; 35 *Cal 35 *Cal 35 Cruise *Express 35 *Freedom 35 *Goderich 35 *Hughes 36 *Hughes-Columbia 36 *Hunter 35 Legend *Hunter 35.5 Legend *Hunter 356 *Landfall 35 *Mirage 35 *Niagara 35 *Southern Cross 35 References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Island Packet 35"},{"id":"61153021","text":"Scenes from the heart () is a 2018 book by Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman, her husband Svante Thunberg, and their daughters, climate activist Greta Thunberg, and Beata Ernman.

She, her husband, and the other victims were posthumously rehabilitated after Stalin died. Early life Nesterenko was born sometime during August 1910 to a Ukrainian family in the village of Budy, then part of the Russian Empire. After completing her initial education she worked at a pottery factory while she dreamed of aviation in addition to having hobbies in music and sports. Aviation career Having become a member of the Communist Party in 1931, she graduated from the Kharkov Aviation School before entering the Kacha Military Aviation School of Pilots, which she graduated from in 1933. In July 1940 she flew as pilot-in-command with co-pilot Mariya Mikhaileva and navigator Nina Rusakova in an attempt to break the distance world record for a straight-line women's flight, which had been previously established by Valentina Grizodubova, Polina Osipenko, and Marina Raskova in 1938. The flight took off in Khabarovsk and was supposed to reach Mazyr, but due to a strong headwind combined with a thunderstorm and icing, the flight was forced to make an emergency landing in a field near the village of Isakovo in the Sanchursky District. The team flew nonstop for 22 hours and 32 minutes, but the attempt gained less publicity and was quickly forgotten. In October that year she was appointed as deputy commander of a special purpose-aviation regiment.  Downfall  Shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Nesterenko was arrested at an aerodome on 26 June 1941 and executed along with dozens of other high-ranking officers on 28 October 1941. Officially, she was shot for failure to report a crime, with Beria alleging that as wife of General Rychagov she would have to have been aware of his \\"traitorous activities\\"; it was later revealed that the entire case against Rychagov and his colleagues was fabricated by Beria, who had himself ordered that they be shot without trial. Some English sources claim that Rychagov had gotten in trouble for referring to Soviet aircraft as \\"flying coffins\\", although there is no mention of this in Russian sources.

His name is sometimes given as Iarbas, Hiartas or Hiarbal. Hiarbas may be the historical inspiration for the legendary figure of Iarbas, rejected suitor of Dido, described by Virgil as a Gaetulian. His origins are obscure. He may have been a Gaetulian. He was probably not related to the ruling family of Numidia, which had largely been wiped out following the Jugurthine War in 106. On the death of Gauda in 88, Numidia was divided into a smaller western and a larger eastern kingdom. Hiempsal II inherited the eastern kingdom, but was immediately confronted by a revolt led by Hiarbas. He was deposed and Hiarbas, who would have been regarded as a usurper by the Romans, seized the throne. After their defeat in the Roman civil war of 83‚Äì82, the supporters of Gaius Marius the Younger fled or were exiled to the Roman province of Africa. Under Domitius Ahenobarbus they succeeded in taking control of the province and allied with Hiarbas. Pompey the Great was sent to Africa to restore Roman control. In a campaign that lasted a mere forty days, he defeated and killed Domitius and forced Hiarbas to flee. The latter was soon captured near Bulla Regia and executed. Hiempsal was restored to the throne and the Gaetulians were formally placed under his authority. According to Plutarch, Pompey took Numidia from Hiarbas and gave it to Massinissa II. This seems to indicates that the petty kingdom of western Numidia (which belonged to Massinissa) was also formally recognized by the Romans at this time, having perhaps been under Hiarbas' authority. These events took place either in 82 or 81 BC. Coinage Several coin types have been tentatively attributed to Hiarbas.For images of the coins, see Camps 2000. They lack legends and their attribution is based largely on the lack of other known coins attributable Hiarbas. These coins, if they belong to the reign of Hiarbas, contain the earliest examples of personification from Numidia. The obverse of three show a long-haired bearded man facing right with a long- haired beardless man wearing an elephant scalp facing right on the reverse. This latter image has been taken to be a personification of Africa. The other coin depicts a bridled horse on the reverse.

History and design The bridge at night, 2014 On May 15, 2002, when the United States Department of Transportation approved a plan for the Oklahoma City Crosstown realignment it required that the city build a pedestrian bridge to cross Interstate 40. In 2008, Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett announced a design competition for the bridge. Hans Butzer, who also co-designed the Oklahoma City National Memorial, won the design challenge with a design inspired by the skydance of the Scissor-tailed flycatcher, the Oklahoma state bird. The location of the bridge was chosen because of the \\"Core to shore\\" initiative, intending to connect the core of Downtown Oklahoma City to the shore of the Oklahoma River and as part of the MAPS 3 project an urban park was in the early stages of planning in the same area; the bridge connects the upper portion of the park to the lower portion of the park. The city allocated a budget of $6.8 million and was originally estimated to be around $5.2 million, unexpected problems pushed the estimated cost to $12.8 million. Part of the bridge was redesigned to lower costs, including the removal large cables originally intended to stretch from the top of the bird design to the base of the bridge. Construction was originally expected to run from March to November 2011, but due to the cost issues on the project construction did not begin until August 2011, it was constructed at the same time as construction of the new Interstate 40. The Manhattan Road & Bridge Company built the 380-feet long, 192-feet tall, 20-feet wide, bridge. The bird sculpture was completed in December 2011, and construction was finished in April 2012. The bridge officially opened on April 23, 2012 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony with appearances by design architects and public officials. The design includes fully programmable energy efficient LED lights that illuminate the bridge from dusk to dawn. In June 2019, city leaders approved a $840,000 repair project on the bridge to replace the wood deck which had reached its lifespan, the wood deck was replaced with a fiberglass deck with construction that took place in the summer and fall of 2019.

It was originally the mountain retreat for a wealthy Sydney merchant and was owned by him for over twenty years. It was then the home of several other prominent people until about 1918 when it was converted into a hotel. Today it still provides hotel accommodation and is a venue for special events particularly weddings and conferences. Early history Advertisement for the sale of Craigieburn by Alexander Maxwell in 1888 Alexander Hamilton Keith Maxwell (1842-1907) built Craigieburn in about 1885. In June 1885 the builder John Joseph Campbell of Bowral advertised for tenders to haul 80 to 100 thousand bricks from a kiln to Mr Maxwell‚Äôs property. At the end of the year Mrs Maxwell placed an advertisement in the local paper for a ‚Äúhouse and parlour maid‚Äù at Craigieburn, Bowral. John Campbell was one of the earliest pioneers of Bowral and built many of the town‚Äôs public and private buildings. Alexander was born in Sydney in 1842. His father emigrated from Scotland to Australia in about 1840 and became the Registrar of the Sydney District Court. Alexander decided to become a merchant and was a partner in the firm of Caird, Maxwell and Co. He was quite wealthy and had a home in Darlinghurst Road in Potts Point. He also bought land in other areas of New South Wales. In 1872 he married Elizabeth Catherine Taylor (1852-1922) who was the daughter of John Taylor of ‚ÄúSugar Brae‚Äù in Waverley. The couple had three sons and two daughters. In 1888 Alexander decided to advertise Craigieburn for sale but he subsequently decided to keep the property. The sale notice is shown. The family continued to use the house as a summer residence until Alexander‚Äôs death in 1907. They also allowed some of their friends and family to stay on the property during this time. Their daughter Marion (called May) Pilcher and her husband Herbert who was a Sydney barrister were often there. In 1894 Thomas Forster Knox and his family took the house for the summer. Alexander died in 1907 and the house was bought by Joseph Cooper (1823-1909). He came from a family of wealthy pastoralists in the Hunter and New England districts. His brother was Theo Cooper and together they owned about six properties in this area. At his time both brothers, now widowers and in their 80s, decided to live in the Southern Highlands. Theo bought ‚ÄúWerrington‚Äù a large house in Burradoo at the same time that Joseph bought Craigieburn. Joseph died in 1909 and the property was advertised for sale. It was bought by the Minter family. Later owners Criagieburn at the beginning of the 20th Century Gordon Kennedy Minter (1858-1930) was also a wealthy pastoralist. He had properties at Condobolin, Canowindra, Grenfell and Forbes. He founded the Wooyeo Picnic Race Club and was one of the original members of the Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Association at Canowindra. In 1880 he married Helena Townsend who was the daughter of Thomas Townsend, a grazier. The couple had five sons and four daughters. Three of his sons enlisted to fight in World War 1. By 1918 Craigieburn was owned by Mrs Lydia Horton. She previously ran a boarding house in Neutral Bay.NSW Electoral Roll of 1913. In partnership with Richard Henry Allen she bought Craigieburn and over the next ten years they made major additions to the property to convert it to one of the most exclusive hotels in the Southern Highlands. In 1919 they opened the golf course and the event was marked with a huge celebration which was described in detail in a newspaper of that time. Her daughter Freda Horton was frequently mentioned in the social pages and in 1926 was married at Bowral with the reception being held at Craigieburn. In 1945 she and Allen handed the management of the hotel to a Board of Directors. Today the property operates as Peppers Craigieburn and provides hotel accommodation, dining facilities and is a venue for special events.

They are nocturnal, carnivorous, and flightless orthopterans belonging to the family Anostostomatidae. Being a nocturnal species, individuals remain in tunnels (galleries) during the day and emerge from their burrows after sunset to forage and hunt for small invertebrates. H. maculifrons is one of the smallest New Zealand weta species, averaging 15 mm in length (from the head to the tip of the last abdominal segment, excluding ovipositor in females) and weighing 1‚Äì3 g. Unlike the tree weta and tusked weta, where sexual dimorphism is found in the form of male weaponry, ground weta only exhibit sexual size dimorphism: the females are larger than the males. Morphology Hemiandrus maculifrons are characterized by a dark brown pronotum and upper abdomen, and a mottled femur. They are small to medium- sized, about 15 mm in length from the head to the tip of the abdomen. This species is very similar in appearance to three other Hemiandrus species found in New Zealand but can be recognized by a relatively long ovipositer in adult females. The head is shiny and brown with a darker shade on top, showing a faint pale dorsal midline. The antennae are longer than the body and the eyes are black. Ground weta are sexually sized dimorphic, with the females larger than males, unlike closely related species. Females also have a long, gently curved ovipositor protruding from the end of their abdomen. H. maculifrons has very long legs, the hind femora is 2.8‚Äì3.5 times head width. Femora are cream coloured and gradually becoming brown to the tibiae, both femora and tibiae are spotted. Spines are also present, thirteen cream articulated spines on the fore tibiae; seventeen cream articulated spines with brown tips on the mid tibiae; and about thirty to forty-seven spines on the hind tibiae. Fore tibiae also lack tympanum. Adult males are characterised by the presence of bark, sclerotised hooks (falci) underneath the ninth abdominal tergite. Adult females are identified by the shape of subgenital plate and a sclerotised ovipositor. Distribution and habitat Hemiandrus maculifrons is widespread in forested parts of South Island New Zealand. In northern South Island H. maculifrons is sympatric with the morphologically very similar species H. luna, H. brucei and H. nox. These cryptic species are hosts to the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which might explain their speciation without ecological differentiation or geographic separation. Although the species- complex extends across Cook Strait, H. maculifrons is the only one of these cryptic species that is not found in North Island. They hide during the day in tunnels in the ground (galleries) under moss, soil, leaf litter and rotting logs. Galleries are cavities that can extent up to 10 cm below the surface of the soil or moss, and are usually slightly wider than the weta's body length. When they are constructed under rotting logs, often the log is incorporated into one side of the gallery. Diet Hemiandrus maculifrons are primarily predators and scavengers: they usually hunt and forage in forest litter and in trees at night. Both adults and juveniles eat a range of small invertebrates such as beetles, moths, and flies. Interestingly, there is a single case where mountain snow berry (Gaultheria depressa) seeds were found in the frass of a H. maculifrons . This could indicate that this species can be omnivorous. Breeding Hemiandrus maculifrons has a non-seasonal life history: adults, young, and eggs can be found at any time of the year. Their food (the small leaf-litter invertebrates) do not change much in abundance over the year in New Zealand forests. =Courtship and copulation= Unlike other singing ensiferans, ground weta do not have tibial tympanae. Sexually active males hit their abdomens on substrates, such as leaf or soil surfaces, to produce pre- copulation vibratory sounds as signals for mate attraction; this is known as drumming. The number of abdomen hits on the substrate, the duration of the drumming, and the intervals between drumming all differ between species, these vibrations are believed to be species specific. Pheromones produced from anal secretions may be involved in long-distance communication. After locating a mate, the male and female come into antenna to antenna contact. If the female is accepted by the male, the male then turns to face the same direction as the female and backs under her, or alternatively the female mounts the male. Once underneath the female, the male transports a spermatophore, consisting of a spermatophylax and an ampulla, to the female through genital contact. The spermatophylax is a large, gelatinous substance attached to the ejaculate and sperm containing ampulla. The spermatopylax protects the ampulla from eaten by the female while the sperm and ejaculate are transferred from the ampulla to the female. =Nuptial feeding and post-copulatory guarding= Males of the members of the orthopteran family provide a nuptial gift to the female. The nuptial gift is produced from a gland on the dorsal surface of the male's metanotum, in this case the spermatophylax, and females consume this while the sperms are transferred from the ampulla. The female also bends to eat the ampulla post copulation (while she finished eating the spermatophylax). The nuptial gift is considered a mechanism which increases the number of sperm transferred into the female, by delaying the female from removing or eating the ampulla. Studies also show that nuptial gifts provide females with additional resources (amino acids) which the females allocate into their ovaries and eggs, thus increases egg production and egg quality. The males remain with the females after copulation while she consumes the spermatophylax. Post-copulatory guarding is thought to keep rivals males from disrupting insemination. =Oviposition= The female H. maculifrons has a long ovipositor which it uses to insert eggs into her tunnel (gallery) walls. H. maculifrons are not known to exhibit maternal care of eggs or young. Observations of related ground weta species found that females remain in their galleries with the eggs without emerging for several months after oviposition, tending to the nymphs _;_ however, parental care is unusually for ground weta species with long ovipositors. It may take several days for the females to oviposit a batch of eggs, and the egg incubation period is around 12‚Äì18 months. Environmental conditions such as seasonal temperature fluctuations will impact egg development, thus the incubation period. Taxonomy Apart from Hemiandrus, Anostostomatidae consists of three other New Zealand genera and about twenty-three other genera from Australia, Africa, South America and New Caledonia. In New Zealand are the tree weta (Hemideina White, 1846), the giant weta (Deinacrida White, 1846), and the tusked weta (Anisoura Ander, 1938, Motuweta Johns, 1997); with the genus Hemiandrus being the most speciose group. Hemiandrus maculifrons is one of the most widespread ground weta species in New Zealand. Hemiandrus maculifrons was first described by Walker in 1869. In 1997, Johns synonymised two Hemiandrus species H. maori (Pictet & Saussure 1893) and H. gracilis (Salmon 1950) with H. maculifrons. H. maculifrons is a cryptic species complex which comprises multiple species that all look very similar. Both specimens used by Pictet and Saussure (1893) and Salmon (1950) for their description appeared to belong to the same species of the H. maculifrons complex which were from the southernmost populations (body length varies from the norther to the southern population with the southern population being the largest). The southernmost species of this complex retained the name H. maculifrons whilst the others were given new names. A morphological and genetic study published in 2016 separated two new species from the specific name H. maculifrons: Hemiandrus luna sp. nov and Hemiandrus brucei sp. nov References External links *Southern Alps Photography with images Category:Weta ","title":"Hemiandrus maculifrons"},{"id":"61153394","text":"Paulo Abi-Ackel (born 21 June 1963) is a Brazilian politician and pastor.

Roosevelt.  Early life  Brant was born on January 17, 1885, in Walker, Iowa, the son of David Brant, the editor of the local newspaper, and Ruth Hurd Brant. After attending local schools, he earned a BA in 1909 at the University of Iowa. In 1918 Brant became a reporter St. Louis Star-Times. He left the Star- Times in 1923, to write poetry, plays and children's novels. In 1930, Brant returned to the newspaper as an editorial writer.  Journalism and writing  Brant wrote about conservation of natural resources for magazines and in 1930 was a founder of the Emergency Conservation Committee. Brant advised Roosevelt and Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, on conservation issues, such as the protection of migratory ducks against the demands of farmers.Irving Brant, \\"Adventures in Conservation Putting It Up to FDR.\\" Journal of Forest History 32.1 (1988): 32-41. In the late 1930s, Brant performed survey work that established the boundaries of the new Olympic National Park. In 1936, Brant wrote Storm over the Constitution, defense of the constitutionality of the New Deal, which was challenged repeatedly in the U.S. Supreme Court. Brant's work reportedly encouraged Roosevelt in 1937 to send a bill to the U.S. Congress to enlarge the membership of the Supreme Court and overcome the conservative majority. The so-called court packing plan lost in Congress after a bitter fight.  Madison biography  Brant's study of the Supreme Court led him to examine the legacy of former president James Madison, who was largely ignored by historians at the time. When he first started writing the biography, he operated under the assumption that Jefferson overshadowed Madison's political contributions, especially influenced by the writings of the historian Henry Adams and his history of the United States. \\"I began writing the life of Madison without the slightest suspicion that the prevailing estimates of him were incorrect.\\" While he had first focused on the then acknowledged contributions of Madison as architect of the Constitution and author of the Bill of Rights, he came to believe that Madison was equal in importance to Thomas Jefferson in creating the United States. \\"Not in the remotest fashion did I suspect that in their political symbiosis, Jefferson might owe as much to Madison as Madison to Jefferson\\". Brant wanted to rehabilitate Madison's reputation as a theorist of constitutional issues; to demonstrate Madison's mastery of practical politics; and to refute the states rights interpretation, which denied that the founding fathers considered the new country to be a single nation rather than a loose confederation of sovereign independent countries.Leonard W. Levy, Encyclopedia of the American Constitution (1986) 1:146. The first volume of the Madison biography was published in 1941, the sixth and final volume in 1961 Brant died on September 18, 1976.

It was written by Madonna and longtime collaborator Mirwais, and produced by the latter two along with Mike Dean. Lyrically the song talks about gun control and also touches on the political climate of the United States at the time. It is an experimental pop, disco, hi-NRG and electropop song and features the Tiffin Children's Chorus repeating \\"We lost god control\\" all throughout. In the music video, we can see Madonna typing \\"we lost gun control\\" and not \\"god control\\" as the song title suggests. American musician Casey Spooner later claimed he had been a co- writer and didn't received credits. It received positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it one of the best songs of the album. On June 26, an accompanying music video directed by Jonas √Ökerlund was released; it interspersed footage of Madonna as her alter ego Madame X with scenes of a nightclub where a shooting takes place. The video was reminiscent of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and was criticized by the media and the survivors of the massacre. However, it was praised by some gun control advocates. Madonna performed \\"God Control\\" during her appearance at Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019, and as the opening number of her 2019‚àí20 Madame X Tour.  Background and composition  In 2017, Madonna relocated to Lisbon, Portugal seeking a top football academy for her son David, who wanted to become a professional association football player. While living in the city, she began meeting artists, painters and musicians, who would invite her to \\"living room sessions\\". In these sessions, they would bring food, sit around the table and musicians would start playing instruments, singing fado and samba music. Finding herself \\"connected through music\\", the singer decided to create an album; \\"I found my tribe [in Lisbon] and a magical world of incredible musicians that reinforced my belief that music across the world is truly all connected and is the soul of the universe\\". On April 15 2019, Madonna revealed Madame X as the album's title. For the album, she worked with longtime collaborator Mirwais, who had previously worked on her albums Music (2000), American Life (2003) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), as well as Mike Dean, who served as a producer on Rebel Heart (2015), and Diplo. \\"God Control\\" was written by Madonna and Mirwais and produced by the latter two along with Mike Dean. It has been described as an experimental pop, disco, hi- NRG and electropop song. Lyrically, it talks about gun control, as well as democracy and the political state of the United States. Musically, it's been described as an \\"euphoric, densely layered samba-disco-gospel mash-up\\" with violins and a retro sound. It features a gospel choir, gunshot sounds and vocodered vocals. The song begins with Madonna singing \\"Everybody knows the damn truth/Our nation lied and lost respect\\" in a \\"clenched teeth\\" style, followed by the Tiffin Children's Chorus repeating the phrase \\"we lost gun control\\" in a \\"creepy\\" way. It is followed by a \\"schmaltzy\\" chorus inspired by Philadelphia soul in which Madonna sings \\"It's a hustle\\" amid \\"zany\\" backing verses about \\"a new democracy\\". On one particular section, there's a rap that features the artists using a \\"cheesy\\" accent - compared by some critics to the vocal style she used on her 1990 album I'm Breathless and electronic duo Daft Punk - to sing \\"Each new birthday gives me hope / that's why I don't smoke that dope\\" and talks about her brain being \\"her only friend\\". =Songwriting claim= In November 2019, American musician Casey Spooner claimed he had been a co-writer on \\"God Control\\" but was never credited or compensated for it. Spooner said he had created the song's melody when Mirwais asked him to rewrite the lyrics and mix the audio of a demo for his solo album, in which he wanted to sing in English about American politics. Soon afterwards, Mirwais abandoned the project to go work with Madonna; Spooner expressed interest in working with the singer but never received a response. When Spooner first heard the melody to \\"God Control\\", he felt it was too similar to the one he had created and accused the producer of using his work without permission; he then posted a snippet, comparing both songs, on his Instagram account. According to him, once Madonna heard this, she contacted Spooner claiming she was unaware of his contributions, and offered him $10,000 as an advance - which was later increased to $25,000 - as well as 15% of writing credits and royalties. Spooner turned this down, as he claimed he would only receive $10,000 of the $25,000 settlement after covering taxes and his legal fees. He also claimed that \\"there's no money in record sales. Not even for Madonna\\", and demanded he be paid 1% of the singer's touring profits to \\"cover [my] contribution and damages\\".  Reception  Madonna, flanked by her dancers, singing \\"God Control\\" during her appearance at Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019 The track received positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, wrote that \\"darkness hangs heavy [on the album], surfacing fiercely in the clenched-mouth phrasing on 'God Control'\\". Varietys Jeremy Helligar deemed it, alongside previous track \\"Dark Ballet\\", as one of the moments in Madame X where \\"true weirdness sets in\\", and \\"the closest Madonna may ever come to her own 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\\". Ben Beaumont-Thomas, from The Guardian, called it one of the album's \\"shockers suitable only for schadenfreude lovers or scholars of extreme camp\\". He further concluded that \\"it is ‚Äì only just ‚Äì brilliant, and will become an equally beloved and despised curio among fans\\". Mike Wass from Idolator, said it was a \\"daring, successful experiment [...] sprawling and perhaps unnecessarily baroque, but it burns with ambitious and anger. And still manages to be pop\\". Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield hailed it as \\"a rare moment of Madonna understatement\\". Louise Bruton from The Irish Times, stated that the song is \\"an experimental stand against authoritarianism and gun control through distorted Black Mirror- style pop [...] to basically shake our shoulders and tell us to wake up, sheeple\\". Samuel R. Murrian from Parade ranked it at number 96 on his list of the singer's 100 greatest songs. According to Nicolas Hautman from Us Weekly, \\"God Control\\" is Madonna's \\"most daring and epic\\" song since 2012's \\"Gang Bang\\". Gay Times Daniel Megarry deemed it \\"creative, dance-able and unexpected [...] pure perfection\\", as well as the best song on the album. Jonny Coleman from The Hollywood Reporter called the track a \\"a six-plus-minute odyssey\\". Papers Bradley Stern described it as a \\"happy-go-lucky disco ode to gun control\\". While reviewing Madame X for The Independent, Alexandra Pollard said \\"God Control\\" was \\"an attack on America's feeble gun-control laws\\". Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, opined it was the \\"album's pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\", as well as \\"the most exhilaratingly batshit thing she's done in years\\". For The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber, it felt \\"like a few songs in one\\". Nonetheless, he called it an \\"irresistible take on Philadelphia soul\\" and praised it for being both \\"a camp commentary on the way people can dance in the face of crisis\\" and \\"catchy and amusing\\". Wren Graves, from online magazine Consequence of Sound, listed \\"God Control\\" as one of the standout tracks in Madame X; \\"Madonna's ambitions aren't merely musical. Several songs [on the album] contain social messages with varying amounts of bite [...] But the message is even better expressed on the ambitious 'God Control'\\". The HuffPosts Daniel Welsh opined it was one of the album's \\"party tracks tinged with sadness\\". Robbie Barnett from the Washington Blade compared it to Madonna's 2000 songs \\"Music\\" and \\"Impressive Instant\\", calling it \\"perfectly fit for dance floor consumption\\", the singer's best dance track since \\"Hung Up\\" (2005), as well as the best song on the album. On a less favorable note, Rich Juzwiak from Pitchfork said it was \\"supposed to be fun, but it's exhausting\\".  Music video  = Background and synopsis = Screenshot of the \\"God Control\\" music video, depicting a dead, blood spattered Madonna just after a shooting broke out at a nightclub During an interview with People, Madonna said one of the main reasons she made a video for \\"God Control\\" were her kids; \\"I send my children to school with the same fear every mother in this era has [...] It's really scary to me that the once-safe spaces where we gather, worship and learn are targets. Nobody's safe\\". In another statement, she said that also wanted to draw attention to an ongoing problem in America. Regarding those who could criticize it for being too graphic, she answered: \\"this is what happens. Guns kill\\". The music video for \\"God Control\\" was released on June 26, 2019. It was directed by Jonas √Ökerlund, who had previously worked with Madonna in videos such as \\"Ray of Light\\" (1998), \\"Music\\" (2000), \\"American Life\\" (2003) and \\"Bitch I'm Madonna\\" (2015). It counted with the appearances of drag queen Mon√©t X Change, actress Sofia Boutella, and YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous. It opens with a text reading \\"The story you are about to see is very disturbing. It shows graphic scenes of gun violence. But it's happening every day. And it has to stop\\". Told through flashbacks in reverse chronological order, it begins with Madonna as her alter ego Madame X, wearing a short black wig and sitting at a typewriter typing the song's lyrics, interspersed with footage of the shooting at a New York Studio 54-like nightclub. These scenes were said to have evoked the 2016 Orland nightclub and 2018 Thousand Oaks shootings. The video then moves backwards in time and shows Madonna getting ready to go out; she's wearing a 1970s-inspired gold pantsuit and a blonde bob wig. Other scenes feature Madonna being assaulted on her way to the nightclub, a children's choir singing at a church vigil and footage of protests against guns and the NRA. It ends with the phrase ‚ÄúWake Up\\", and a quote from civil rights activist and Black Panther member Angela Davis, ‚ÄúI am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept\\". = Reception = The video was criticized for its depiction of violence. Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone, said it touched the theme of society's inability to restrict gun ownership, and that certain scenes were a contrast of \\"the joy of nightclub dancing\\" and \\"the brutality of a mass shooting\\". Slant Magazines Alexa Camp noted similarities to the original music video for \\"American Life\\"; while that one was a \\"satire of modern society's consumption of war as popular entertainment\\", 'God Control' depicts the carnage weapons of war can wreak here at home\\". Camp also highlighted easter eggs, including some to Madonna videos from the past. The scene in which the singer is assaulted could be seen as a reference to her 1989 video for \\"Like a Prayer\\", in which Madonna witnesses a young woman being sexually attacked by a group of men. The shot of a crucifix seemingly crying blood was another reference to \\"Like a Prayer\\", according to Camp. The author also pointed out framed photos of Frida Kahlo, Simone de Beauvoir, Patti Smith and Martha Graham hanging on the walls around Madonna's desk; this last one, according to the artist, christened her with the nickname ‚ÄúMadame X‚Äù in the late 1970s. Christopher Rudolph from The Backlot called it a \\"disturbing disco bloodbath\\". Spencer Kornhaben said that the graphic tones of the video took away the song's \\"ambiguity and subtext\\", and criticized it for glamourizing trauma and \\"amplifying it\\", without \\"pushing the conversation anywhere new\\". He concluded: \\"people unsympathetic to Madonna's cause are not likely to be moved; people sympathetic to her cause are left feeling drained\\". Gay Times Daniel Megarry called it the singer's \\"most shocking [video] yet\\". Billboards Sal Cinquemani listed \\"God Control\\" as one of Madonna's nine most controversial videos. Idolator named it the best music video of 2019; Mike Nied said it showed Madonna was still capable of \\"creating work that is both visually striking and capable of speaking to larger cultural issues\\". Shannon Watts, who founded Moms Demand Action, thanked Madonna for raising awareness about the horrors of gun violence. Actor George Takei, who set up the anti-gun group 1Pulse4America after the Orlando shooting, and March for Our Lives, the lobby group founded after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, were among those who praised the singer and the video. Patience Carter, survivor of the Orlando shooting, tweeted: \\"I applaud the attempt, but I am truly disturbed\\". Similarly, fellow survivor Brandon Wolf said that he appreciated the message, but felt the singer was using the tragedy and the victims as \\"props\\". Emma Gonzalez, Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor, panned the video for being \\"fucked up and horrible\\".  Live performances  Madonna first performed \\"God Control\\" during her appearance at Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019; she wore an eye-patch with an X, which was designed in the colors of the Rainbow flag, while her background dancers were decked as police officers wielding combat shields. Billboard praised the \\"visually powerful live performance [...] replete with detailed choreography and a disco groove that had the crowd gyrating and shimmying\\". The song was then performed as the opening number of the singer's Madame X Tour. The show began with a quote by James Baldwin: \\"Art is here to prove that all safety is an illusion... Artists are here to disturb the peace\\". Then, a silhouetted woman sat at a typewriter; each key press sounding like a gunshot, accompanied by a dancer jerking and flinching as if he's been shot. Madonna then appeared, decked in a glittery Revolutionary War attire and a feathered tricorne hat, to sing the song while being bounced between two police officers‚Äô shields; the performance featured two staircases, that moved and dismantled throughout the show, and cops attacking dancers under a video montage of news footage. On her review of one of the concert at Los Angeles' Wiltern Theatre, Kelli Syke Fadroski opined that \\"it was a bit unnerving to hear dozens of gunshot sound effects echo through a very dark venue. But that was the point\\".

In World War I Green fought in two of the bloodiest battles, the Battle of Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded twice. Green was already 52 when he signed up to fight in the Second World War and his escape from a Stalag Luft III was immortalized in the Hollywood movie The Great Escape. Because of his age at the onset of the Second World War, the troops affectionately called him \\"Pop\\". Military service Green was in the Territorial Army when the first world war began. He was sent to Oxfordshire and was part of the light infantry. In 1915 he was shipped to France and at Ploegsteert Wood he was wounded by shrapnel in the groin. He was then sent to the Machine Gun corps in 1916, he then fought in the Battle of Somme and Passchendaele. In October 1918, just one month before the Armistice, he was wounded again and sent home. Hampden bomber of the RAF In World War II Green enlisted in the RAF at the rank of Flight Lieutenant. He was 52 years old when he signed up with the RAF‚Äôs Bomber Command: he was shot down on his first mission over Denmark in July 1940. Green was operating the rear gunner position flying with the 44th squadron. In the early hours of 20 July 1940 the plane was hit by flak. The Hampden bomber went down in the sea. Two of his crew members were killed, but he and the pilot swam ashore. They were captured by the Germans that same day. Four years later in 1944, he and 75 others escaped from Stalag Luft III. Fifty of the 76 of the escapees were captured and executed. The Great Escape Green participated in the Great Escape. The orchestrators were British officers. The prisoners escaped Stalag Luft III by methodically digging a tunnel. Of the 76 who escaped, 3 men got away, 50 were executed, and 23 were returned to Stalag Luft III. Green was among those who were captured and sent back to Stalag Luft III.

The mountain is situated on the eastern side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Jack Mountain, to the west-southwest. Mount Lago is the highest summit of the Okanogan Range, and follows only Jack Mountain {9,075 ft} as the highest peak in the Pasayten Wilderness. Lago is the fourth-most prominent mountain in the Pasayten Wilderness. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Pasayten River and Methow River. The mountain was named for Lage Wernstedt (1878-1959), a Forest Service surveyor who made numerous first ascents of the mountains he was mapping in the North Cascades. Lago, is a play on the way Americans pronounced his name.Lage Werndtedt methow.net Lage, pronounced Loggy, had a son named Lago. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

It is an adaptation of the logic and principle behind Dogme 95, a Danish filmmaking movement, this time applied to the arena of the voice as opposed to the moving image.  History  Characterized early on as \\"strange Ugly Mane-esque satirical seriousness\\", music coming from The Unilalia Group (before and after incorporation) has always demonstrated a low-budget approach to pushing creative and stylistic boundaries in the studio of the vocalist. Dogma 19 represents a conventionalization of this approach, now packaged and ready for distribution.  Overview  Dogma 19 is a critical reaction to the advent of social media and its transformation of the art world, consumption patterns, and the palette of the consumer. Pulled directly from its manifesto: > \\"The purpose of Dogma 19 is to cultivate a new authenticity in the workrooms > and studios of the vocalist in particular ‚Äì the advent of clout culture and > its copy and paste styles of expression have contributed to a decline of > artistry in exchange for cultural assimilation. Public channels become > flooded with oversaturated, redundant, duplicative content while access > points are simultaneously consolidated. Multimedia conglomerates and > subsidiary labels alike project baseless archetypes, coded messages, and > manufactured associations which in turn shape the cultural palette of > today's consumer ‚Äì entertainment has conquered creativity as capital drives > the art world, irrespective of medium.\\" A set of rules and restrictions were developed to rejuvenate the creative process; vocalists are forced to depend solely on their own individual talent, ingenuity, and intelligence in the composition of a Dogma 19 record. = Rules and objectives = Dogma 19 seeks to purify the creative process of the vocalist by forbidding the use of expensive, artificial, and otherwise spectacular special effects, pitch correction, modifications and other technical gimmicks (autotune, quantizers, and so on). It is a challenge, a test, a ritualization of the vocalist's approach designed to raise talent and ingenuity to the forefront of the audience's concerns. Listeners are brought closer to the artist, their attention no longer distracted by overproduction. Dogma 19 records are characterized by a conformation to the following rules: # All writing and recording must be done alone, in isolation. Ghostwriters, writing in groups, or anything remotely similar is absolutely forbidden. # Vocalist must only use GarageBand. External plugins are forbidden. Built-in plugin use limited to Pitch Shifter, Fuzz-Wah, Compressor, and Channel EQ only. Any use of autotune, metronomes, quantizers, or anything similar is forbidden. # Vocalist must do all mixing and engineering by themselves. All outside assistance is forbidden. # All instrumentation must be externally sourced and licensed; no track-outs allowed under any circumstances. # Vocalist must record in same space they sleep in: all professional studios are forbidden. # Features are forbidden, no exceptions. # Records must be conceptual narrative works. # Lo-fi genre records are not acceptable. # Budget must not exceed $500 # Labels must not be credited. = Examples of Dogma 19 Records = * To Unilalia: Official Trailer (2019) * The Highway (2019)  Notes & references  Category:Music production ","title":"Dogma 19"},{"id":"61154047","text":"The Alhambra Theatre is a theatre that opened in 1952 in Berea, a neighborhood of Durban, South Africa.

He has lectured at many universities and medical centers around the world. His research has dealt with immunology, cellular therapy, policy and ethics. Millis received the Hippocrates Award in 2012, and the Global Citizen Hero Award from Red Cross and the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017.  Education  Millis graduated with a B.A. in Chemistry and Political Science from Emory University in 1981. Later, he completed his M.D. from University of Tennessee in 1985 and joined the University of California at Los Angeles as a surgery intern. In 1987, he also started research in liver transplantation at UCLA, becoming the Dumont Transplant Fellow at the institute in 1992. At the same time, he was an Instructor in Surgery at UCLA. In 2014, he received an MBA from University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Career  Millis left UCLA in 1994 to join the University of Chicago as assistant professor in Department of Surgery, becoming associate professor in 1997 and professor in 2002. In 1994, he also joined the University of Chicago Hospitals. In 1997, he was appointed the director of Pediatric Liver Transplant Program and Liver Transplant Program at University of Chicago Hospitals. He stepped down from the position of director at the Liver Transplant Program in 2006, being appointed again as the director of the program in 2014. From 2000 to 2016, he was the Chief of Section of Transplant Surgery at UCLA. In 2008, he founded the Transplant Center at University of Chicago Medical Center and led the center until 2016, stepping down to focus on his international efforts of improving surgical care and ethics, establishing the Global Surgery Program at the University of Chicago. Millis has done significant work in the area of global surgery, hosting dozens of physicians and scientists from China and other countries around the world desiring experience in the United States. He developed the Clinical Leadership Development Fellowship program at University of Chicago that provides people from other countries the training to lead clinical health care enterprises. He has hosted dozens of Chinese students, residents and faculty at the University of Chicago to provide them with first-hand knowledge of the delivery of surgical care at leading academic health centers. He has also facilitated visits by US residents, fellows and faculty to Chinese centers to broaden their exposure and experience. In 2015, he was appointed the Vice Chair of Global Surgery at the University of Chicago. In 2015, he became a senior faculty scholar at Bucksbaum Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2017 a faculty member at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Millis serves on the editorial board of many scientific journals in the field of transplantation and surgery including World Journal of Gastroenterology and Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. He is also the co-editor of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition. = Research = Since the beginning of his career in the late 1980s, Millis's research has been focused on liver transplant and developing innovate techniques for liver surgery. His research has dealt with immunology, cellular therapy, policy and ethics. Most of his initial research studied patient care following a liver transplant and techniques for improving liver transplantation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he started focusing on Pediatric liver transplant, studying both the techniques of liver transplantation in children and outcomes of the procedure. During this time also conducted some research on liver transplant in the Asian population. In late 1990s, a lot of his work was focused on liver transplantation in children. Towards the beginning of 2000, he started writing about ethics in medical practice in general and liver transplant in specific. Millis has also conducted researching exploring how cellular technology can be applied to patient care. He has organized many national and international conferences on the topics ranging from violence in healthcare to surgical research. = Healthy policy and ethics = A significant part of Millis's research has focused on policy and ethics in the field of health; and implementing ethical standards as the field of surgery becomes global. In 2006, he, with support of the China Medical Board, worked with Jiefu Huang, then the vice minister of health of China, to establish regulations governing the practice of transplantation in China and improve the outcomes and ethical standards of the transplantationin China. They initiated reforms that paved the way for banning transplant tourism and buying and selling of organs. They further established the requirements for transplant procedures including surgeon experience and ICU requirements. Millis and Huang initiated a pilot program in China that allowed for voluntary organ donation. Upon the success of the program, it was expanded nationally. Later, in January 2018, the use of organs from executed donors was also banned in China. Their work changed the entire policy of transplantation in China. Millis also organized several conferences in China on the issues of ethics in healthcare in international settings. In 2016, he helped the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in reforming their GME into a competency and milestone-based curriculum from their apprentice based system.

Each section was developed in 19th century, separately, before being joined in the 20th century. One section of more than 20 acres was previously used as a stone quarry. Originally the quarry was a private enterprise. It was purchased by the City of Madison in 1890. The other section once belonged to Edward T. Owen, a professor at what is now the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Owen eventually donated the land to a local private parks association and it became known as Owen Parkway. Additional land would be donated by Frank W. Hoyt, a key figure in the parks association. Eventually, the city closed down the stone quarry and the two sections were combined into one public park, later to be named after Frank W. Hoyt. During the Great Depression, several structures and pathways were developed by the Civil Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration. In 2018, the park was added to the State and the National Register of Historic Places.

He is currently an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. Early life and achievements Arakawa was the youngest of three sons. Living through World War II in Japan, he recalled his two older brothers served in the Japanese military without incident, while he was drafted to work as a fireman part-time while finishing high school. He entered the University of Tokyo in 1947, and spent three years majoring in physics. After graduating in 1950, he applied for one of the few jobs available for physics graduates, with the Japan Meteorological Agency. The agency stationed him on a weather ship to gain experience, and after working in that area for a year and a half, he sought another role in the agency, and was able to gain a position in the forecast research division. In the 1950s, Arakawa developed mathematics that \\"permitted the use of a coarser grid\\" to reduce the computational time needed to estimate climate changes from air sampling data. During this time, Arakawa consulted on the early Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) weather model, later taken up and further advanced by meteorologist Dr. James Hansen.Mark Bowen, Censoring Science: Dr. James Hansen and the Truth of Global Warming, Plume, 2007, p. 221.

It was produced by former Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning and Nick DiDia, it was recorded at Fannings and DiDia's studio in Byron Bay over the course of a year. The album marks lead guitarist Chris Antolak's last recording as a member of the band. Background and promotion The album artwork was created by Cristina Daura. Describing the album, frontwoman Maz DeVita said: :\\"The whole album is about grief for so many things that I felt when we were writing the record and still do now. The way the world is so volatile at the moment, our environment, I talk about anxiety, mania, cutting ties with old friends and habits, my problems in the past with body image, and it's almost like a big mourning for all that. It's definitely an outpouring of grief in every sense of the word. But as much as I explored darker themes for Big Grief, I framed my melodies and vocal very colourfully and lively.\\" Shortly after the band signed to Dew Process they released their first single \\"Labrador\\" on 27 April 2018. The music video was released on 8 June. On 24 February 2019, the band posted the date \\"27.02.2019\\" to their social media accounts, hinting at a new single release. The second single, \\"FU\\", was premiered on Triple J's Good Nights segment, and was then made commercially available a day later. On 9 April, a music video for \\"FU\\" was released. On 14 May, Waax released their third single \\"I Am\\". On the same day they also announced an national tour for August, after their USA and Canadian tour. On 18 June, the music video for \\"I Am\\" was released. Writing and composition The single \\"Labrador\\" as being about the Gold Coast suburb Labrador which frontwoman Maz DeVita described as a place where a significant relationship ended in her life. Speaking about the single \\"FU\\", DeVita said: \\"This song is about a situation with someone in your life who is taking advantage of you and finally having to acknowledge reality and stand up to them. I hope it‚Äôs as cathartic for the listener as it was to write.\\" The track \\"History\\" details DeVita's experience in her teenage years wherein she suffered from an eating disorder. \\"Fade\\" is about a friend of DeVita's who went through a hard time being victim blamed and having no one believe them. DeVita explained the single \\"I Am\\" as being \\"about wanting to please someone so much that you forget who you are in the process.\\" Critical reception The album received positive reviews. Jack Walsh from Depth magazine praised it saying the album's good points were: \\"Empowering words through hard themes. Nice runtime. Incredible production. Vocal skills are untouchable.\\" However criticised the bad points as: \\"At times it feels more like a collection of singles than a cohesive and continuous vibe.\\" In a positive review from Wall of Sound, Rory McDonald said: \\"Big Grief is gold from front to back. [...] the band has stayed true to their authentic brand of punk and they have served it up nicely.\\" In a 9-out-of-10 review, Hysteria praised DeVita's emotional vocal delivery of the lyrics. The Music, in a positive reviews states that: \\"WAAX have redefined what it means to be punk in the 21st century. This is an album that makes a point, one that sits on the top end of the anguish scale without sacrificing the band's melodic ingenuity.\\" Track listing Track listing adapted from Apple Music.

Washington Reviewing the Western Army at Fort Cumberland, Maryland Frederick Kemmelmeyer (c. 1755 - c. 1821) was a German-born American painter. He was entirely self-taught and his work is generally classified as folk art. Biography His approximate birth year has been established through census records, but no birth certificate or baptismal record has been found. Naturalization papers in Annapolis, Maryland, dating from 1788, list a Frederick Kimmelmeiger, who is assumed to be him, although it is not known when or why he came to the United States. Speculation has centered around a Friedrich Kimmelmeyer who served as a medic with the Hessians during the Revolution, deserted to the Americans, and was briefly married in South Carolina, but no firm connection has been made.Biography @ AskArt. Soon after becoming a citizen, he placed advertisements in the Maryland Gazette and the Baltimore Advertiser, offering his services as a drawing instructor, a painter of miniatures and a sign painter.Biography @ the National Gallery of Art. Many of his early works are copies of European lithographs and engravings. He remained in Baltimore until 1803, when he became an itinerant portrait painter. Over the next fourteen years, his travels can be traced through his advertisements, beginning in Alexandria, Virginia, where he opened a school. Shortly after, he relocated to Georgetown. Several of his paintings from that period are portraits of George Washington or scenes from battles that feature him. By 1805, he appears to have been in Hagerstown, then went a bit further, to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. This was followed, in 1810, by advertisements in Winchester, Virginia. Two years later, he taught and painted in what is now West Virginia. His last known advertisement appeared in 1816, in Hagerstown. A combination of age and alcoholism apparently had a serious negative effect on his ability to paint. His last years are largely undocumented. Only eleven portraits have been positively identified as his. References Further reading * A.

Life  Born in Berlin, Sebald was a daughter of the alto von Sebald, n√©e Schwadke, and of the Justice Council Karl Christian August Sebald. Like her sister Auguste, who later married the Protestant priest Carl Ritschl, she was a soprano. In the records of the Singakademie her mother is recorded for the year 1791, her daughters for 1801 and 1802 respectively; the three ladies appeared as soloists for the first time in 1794 and 1803 and 1804 respectively.A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, vol. 3, Beethoven met Sebald in the summer of 1811 in the spa resort Teplitz; she had arrived together with the countess Elisa von der Recke. At that time, the heart of the composer was won, who met her again in Teplice in 1812. Sebald later, on 17 October 1815, married the Berlin Justice Councillor Ludwig Krause (around 1781-1825), whom she survived. while Beethoven remained unmarried and five years later told Gianastasio de Rio that he had little hope of winning over the woman he had fallen in love with.Adolph Bernhard Marx, Ludwig van Beethoven. Leben und Schaffen, 5th edition, 2nd part, Berlin 1901, Sebald apparently still worked as a singing teacher after her marriage. One of her pupils was Lili Parthey, to whom she gave in 1817 a medallion with hair of Queen Luise for her birthday.  Beethoven's love letter  The Beethoven scholar Wolfgang Alexander Thomas-San-Galli believed in 1910 to have found in Sebald the addressee of the famous Letter to the Immortal Beloved, a letter which Beethoven had written to an unknown person in the Bohemian spa town Teplice on July 6-7, 1812. Thomas-San-Galli's thesis is no longer discussed today. Sebald died in Berlin at age 58.  Further reading  * Ludwig Nohl, Beethovens letzte Liebe.

Relative to simple linear regression, NGR uses the ensemble spread as an additional predictor, which is used to improve the prediction of uncertainty and allows the predicted uncertainty to vary from case to case. The prediction of uncertainty in NGR is derived from both past forecast errors statistics and the ensemble spread. NGR was originally developed for site-specific medium range temperature forecasting, but has since also been applied to site-specific medium-range wind forecasting and to seasonal forecasts, and has been adapted for precipitation forecasting. The introduction of NGR was the first demonstration that probabilistic forecasts that take account of the varying ensemble spread could achieve better skill scores than forecasts based on standard Model output statistics approaches applied to the ensemble mean. Intuition Weather forecasts generated by computer simulations of the atmosphere and ocean typically consist of an ensemble of individual forecasts. Ensembles are used as a way to attempt to capture and quantify the uncertainties in the weather forecasting process, such as uncertainty in the initial conditions and uncertainty in the parameterisations in the model. For point forecasts of normally distributed variables, one can summarize an ensemble forecast with the mean and the standard deviation of the ensemble. The ensemble mean is often a better forecast than any of the individual forecasts, and the ensemble standard deviation may give an indication of the uncertainty in the forecast. However, direct output from computer simulations of the atmosphere needs calibration before it can be meaningfully compared with observations of weather variables. This calibration process is often known as model output statistics (MOS). The simplest form of such calibration is to correct biases, using a bias correction calculated from past forecast errors. Bias correction can be applied to both individual ensemble members and the ensemble mean. A more complex form of calibration is to use past forecasts and past observations to train a simple linear regression model that maps the ensemble mean onto the observations. In such a model the uncertainty in the prediction is derived purely from the statistical properties of the past forecast errors. However, ensemble forecasts are constructed with the hope that the ensemble spread may contain additional information about the uncertainty, above and beyond the information that can be derived from analysing past performance of the forecast. In particular since the ensemble spread is typically different for each successive forecast, it has been suggested that the ensemble spread may give a basis for predicting different levels of uncertainty in different forecasts, which is difficult to do from past performance-based estimates of uncertainty. Whether the ensemble spread actually contains information about forecast uncertainty, and how much information it contains, depends on many factors such as the forecast system, the forecast variable, the resolution and the lead time of the forecast. NGR is a way to include information from the ensemble spread in the calibration of a forecast, by predicting future uncertainty as a weighted combination of the uncertainty estimated using past forecast errors, as in MOS, and the uncertainty estimated using the ensemble spread. The weights on the two sources of uncertainty information are calibrated using past forecasts and past observations in an attempt to derive optimal weighting. Overview Consider a series of past weather observations y_t over a period of T days (or other time interval): :y_t, \\\\quad t=1,\\\\ldots,T and a corresponding series of past ensemble forecasts, characterized by the sample mean m_t and standard deviation s_t of the ensemble: :(m_t,s_t), \\\\quad t=1,\\\\ldots,T. Also consider a new ensemble forecast from the same system with ensemble mean M and ensemble standard deviation S, intended as a forecast for an unknown future weather observation Y. A straightforward way to calibrate the new ensemble forecast output parameters (M,S) and produce a calibrated forecast for Y is to use a simple linear regression model based on the ensemble mean M, trained using the past weather observations and past forecasts: :y_t \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta m_t, \\\\sigma^2) This model has the effect of bias correcting the ensemble mean and adjusting the level of variability of the forecast. It can be applied to the new ensemble forecast (M,S) to generate a point forecast for Y using :\\\\hat{Y}\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}+\\\\hat{\\\\beta} M or to obtain a probabilistic forecast for the distribution of possible values for Y based on the normal distribution with mean \\\\hat{\\\\alpha}+\\\\hat{\\\\beta} M and variance \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2: :\\\\hat{Y} \\\\sim N(\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}+\\\\hat{\\\\beta} M, \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2) The use of regression to calibrate weather forecasts in this way is an example of model output statistics. However, this simple linear regression model does not use the ensemble standard deviation S, and hence misses any information that the ensemble standard deviation may contain about the forecast uncertainty. The NGR model was introduced as a way to potentially improve the prediction of uncertainty in the forecast of Y by including information extracted from the ensemble standard deviation. It achieves this by generalising the simple linear regression model to either: : y_t \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta m_t, \\\\sigma=\\\\gamma + \\\\delta s_t) or : y_t \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta m_t, \\\\sigma^2=\\\\gamma + \\\\delta s_t^2) this can then be used to calibrate the new ensemble forecast parameters (M,S) using either : \\\\hat{Y} \\\\sim N(\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}+\\\\hat{\\\\beta} M, \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}=\\\\hat{\\\\gamma} + \\\\hat{\\\\delta} S) or : \\\\hat{Y} \\\\sim N(\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}+\\\\hat{\\\\beta} M, \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^2=\\\\hat{\\\\gamma} + \\\\hat{\\\\delta} S^2) respectively. The prediction uncertainty is now given by two terms: the \\\\gamma term is constant in time, while the \\\\delta term varies as the ensemble spread varies. Parameter estimation In the scientific literature the four parameters \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\delta of NGR have been estimated either by maximum likelihood or by maximum CRPS. The pros and cons of these two approaches have also been discussed. History NGR was originally developed in the private sector by scientists at Risk Management Solutions Ltd for the purpose of using information in the ensemble spread for the valuation of weather derivatives. Terminology NGR was originally referred to as ‚Äòspread regression‚Äô rather than NGR. Subsequent authors, however, introduced first the alternative names Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) and then NGR. The original name ‚Äòspread regression‚Äô has now fallen from use, EMOS is used to refer generally to any method used for the calibration of ensembles, and NGR is typically used to refer to the method described in this article.

Cycling has been considered Cycling mobility must be contrasted with mass automobility for which it is an immediate competitor in cities and for shorter distances. Cities are a hotbed for experimenting with new bicycle-based forms of mobility like bicycle sharing, electric bicycles and transport of bulky goods with cargo bikes. After decades of relative stagnation in bicycle development, new technologies and materials are tried to further improve upon the environmental footprint of the bicycle. Even though it is recognized that cycling - the one foremost active mobility besides walking - is the most sustainable kind of mobility and means of transportation, in some countries, cycling is still the mode of transport for the poor; in others, cycling is seen fit only for leisure purposes. In a 2010 document requested by the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism that mobility not only entails the ability to travel, but also encompasses, more importantly, the possibility for the traveller to decide when and where to travel. In terms of this flexibility and cost, bicycles rank among the top choices for shorter distances, up to several kilometers. Positive aspects Further following positive aspects are: *transport efficiency - cycling is the fastest and most flexible mode for 'door to door' travel, like in bicycle commuting. *environmental benefits - most energy efficient means of transport, with the least pollution. *health and fitness issues - 4 hours of cycling per week or approximately 10 km of cycling per day, equivalent to the average cycle trip to and from work, is an adequate level of exercise. *economic and social impacts - cycling provides transport to segments of the population who would not otherwise be able to travel independently for reasons of age (student transport), poverty, insufficient public transport infrastructure, etc. Negative aspects *lack of or inadequacy of road and parking infrastructures - roads are built for cars and bicycle paths are often in worse condition than roads. Cycling infrastructure and bicycle-friendliness is generally neglected in favor of a car-centric infrastructure. *cyclists‚Äô safety and security - the common space for cars and bicycles on the road is not complemented by the same rights and significantly higher risk of accidents for cyclists. *weather conditions - rain and snow impact the unsheltered cyclist more than car drivers. *poor intermodality - because of lack of transport facilities for the bicycles themselves (in trains, buses, etc.) for longer distances.

Elle Hunt of The Guardian said \\"One has to imagine even the most bookish of children is capable of more noteworthy wrongdoings than causing fleeting irritation to local agriculturalists... But even if the transient displacement of grain was the pinnacle of May‚Äôs youthful misbehaviour, her response failed the test implied of the question.\\" Media Mole of the New Statesman argued that May had been much naughtier in her political career.  Impact  The 'fields of wheat' comment was widely reported in the media and became a phrase closely associated with May. Concerns began to grow that a large group of people could be inspired by May's comments to also run through fields, potentially damaging crops in the process. Close to 30,000 people signed up to a event scheduled to take place in Norfolk from 23 to 24 June, with a further 59,000 saying they were interested in attending. A spokesperson from the National Union of Farmers told The Telegraph: \\"We welcome members of the public to responsibly enjoy the countryside, but keep yourself and any dogs to the rights of way and follow the Countryside Code.\\" During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, frontrunner Boris Johnson appeared to mock May as he was pictured near his Oxfordshire home recreating May's \\"naughtiest\\" moment running through what the media reported as a field of wheat. As May neared the end of her Prime Ministership, she noted that \\"One of the silliest things I ever did was answering that question, but there we are.\\"  References  Category:Theresa May Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017 Category:Political Internet memes ","title":"Running through fields of wheat"},{"id":"61155308","text":"Boi is a 2019 Spanish thriller film directed and written by Jorge M.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. It is perhaps one of the best preserved Usonian houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. History Eric Brown was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, in 1914, graduated from Wayne State University, and received a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1937. He married Margaret Ann Davis in 1939. She was born in Plainwell, Michigan in 1913, and. She graduated from Carleton College in 1935. The couple lived in Grand Rapids for a few years, then moved to Kalamazoo in 1941. After a few years, Eric Brown started his own law firm. In 1946, the Browns and five other families established the Parkwyn Village Association, with the intention of constructing a \\"congenial housing community\\" where they could raise their families. The association contacted Frank Lloyd Wright about designing homes for the planned community. Construction began on the Brown's home in 1950, and the family moved in in 1951. The couple lived in the house until 2002, when health issued forced them to move, Eric Brown died later that year, and Margaret followed in 2006. In 2002, the Browns sold the home to Kathryn and Curtis Curtis-Smith. Peter and Janet Copeland purchased the Brown House in 2012. Description The Brown House is a single-story, rectangular Usonian house with a slightly pitched, cantilevered roof. The house measures 130 feet long and 18 to 32 feet wide, containing approximately 2,684 square feet of living space. It is set well back from the street on a mostly wooded, one acre lot. The house is constructed concrete blocks. The house is set into a sloping hillside, so that the house has a very low appearance from the street (the uphill side).

It took place on the same day as other district council elections in Wales and England. The Conservative Party regained control of the council from the Labour Party. The previous Cardiff City Council took place in 1979 and the next full elections took place in 1987. Ward changes This was the first election to be affected by the changes resulting from The City of Cardiff (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1982. Boundaries were redrawn and the number of electoral wards increased from 21 to 26, with a reduction in the numbers of councillors elected per ward. New wards of Butetown, Caerau, Cyncoed, Fairwater, Heath, Lisvane and St Mellons, Llandaff North, Llanrumney, Pentwyn, Radyr & St Fagans, Trowbridge and Whitchurch & Tongwynlais were introduced. The number of councillors reduced overall from 75 to 65. Overview Labour had been in control of the council for the previous four years, but at the 1983 election the Conservatives regained control. With 34 councillors, they had an overall majority of three. Winning only three seats, the SDP-Liberal Alliance did not perform as well as they expected. Labour blamed the ward boundary changes for the outcome. The former Labour council leader, Cllr John Reynolds, suggested it was a good performance, considering the number of council seats available had been reduced particularly in Labour voting areas. The Alliance failed to win seats in wards such as Gabalfa and blamed this on UK politics dominating the contest (with a possible general election on the horizon). The new Conservative council leader, Cllt Ron Watkiss, pledged to use the Tory majority to put some of the council's services out to private contractors. The next designated next Lord Mayor, Olwen Watkin and her designated deputy, Stan James, came top of the poll in Plasnewydd.

Modern arms of universities began appearing in England around the middle of the 15th century, with Oxford's being possibly the oldest university arms in the world, being adopted around the end of the 14th century. The earliest granting of university arms was to King's College Cambridge by Henry VIII in 1449. Arms are still granted by the College of Arms to universities today, with new universities continuing to register arms, which has been seen as an attempt to appear more traditional or legitimate. As corporations, older university arms have historically been granted without a crest, however newer institutions use crests with mantling, including new colleges at older universities. The first crest granted to a university was to Leeds in 1905 while the first British university to be granted supporters was Sussex in 1962, although both Oxford and Cambridge have used angels as supporters and Cambridge has used the 'alma mater' emblem as a crest without these components being officially granted. University and college arms often incorporate, or are simply copies of, arms of their founders or local authorities. At collegiate universities, constituent colleges may bear their own arms, such as at Cambridge and Oxford. Many older coats of arms were recorded by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in The Book of Public Arms in 1915, which also recorded some coats of arms of constituent colleges, and by John Woodward in A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry in 1894. Most university mottos are not granted with the coats of arms, instead being added by custom by the institution, an exception to this being the arms of Imperial College London.

He outlined these ideas in the landmark textbook Insect Resistance in Crop Plants (1951), in which he identified three distinct mechanisms and popularized the idea of host-plant resistance in integrated pest management. Painter was born in Brownwood, Texas and studied at Howard Payne College followed by the University of Texas from which he received his BS in 1922 and a MA in 1924. He then went to Ohio State University and received a Ph.D. in 1926. His research work was on the resistance of plants to insect attack and he pursued the idea of incorporating traits that increased host plant resistance to pest attack in the breeding of crop varieties. His landmark text on plant resistance to insects was Insect Resistance in Crop Plants (1951). In this book he identified three ways in which plants avoided insect damage by not being preferred, through anti-biosis (e.g. through toxicity to the insect) and by tolerating the damage caused by insects. Painter also introduced the phrase host-plant resistance which he defined as ‚Äúcharacters that enable a plant to avoid, tolerate or recover from attacks of insects under conditions that would cause greater injury to other plants of the same species.‚Äù At Kansas State University, Painter helped breed wheat cultivars that were resistant to Hessian fly, stem borers, and aphids. Painter's technique was to scan heavily infested fields and select individual plants that appeared to stand up and select seeds from these for further breeding. Resistance for multiple pests has however always been a challenge to incorporate into a single variety.

History The purpose-built site in Somerset opened in 1985. The Royal Navy previously had underwater breathing training for fixed-wing aircrew at the Royal Navy Air Medical School and had underwater escape for helicopter aircrew in a dunker at HMS VernonFlight International, 25 November 1971; HMS Vernon trained around 800 rotary wing aircrew a year, and had five naval divers. Civilian offshore workers in the UK are also trained at a dunker in Aberdeen. The 1985 site trained up to 1200 rotary wing aircrew a year. Aircrew carry STASS (Short Term Air Supply System). Other countries have the Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device (HABD). STASS was introduced into the Fleet Air Arm in 1992. The new ¬£15m Underwater Escape Training Unit opened on 27 February 2018. The UETU can train up to 6000 aircrew a year. Training The site offers tri-service training for the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps. Foreign countries also train at the dunker too. Fleet Air Arm pilots on Air 424 spend a week at the dunker, and must attend refresher courses every three years. For STASS training, there is a recompression chamber (diving chamber). There is a HUET system for the Lynx which seats eight, and one for the larger helicopters which seats twelve. There is buoyant ascent training. Structure It is situated off the B3151 (former A303), in South Somerset. The dunker operates from Monday to Friday all year. Every three months there is one week of diving training at the site.

Koontz and written by Cameron Burns, Keith Lansdale, and Koontz, with Joe R. Lansdale as executive producer. It stars Devin Druid, Zachary Knighton, Melora Walters, Bill Sage, Pat Healy, Stan Shaw, Natasha Bassett, Noah Segan and Tina Parker. Plot A family home is raided by an armed gang of thieves in the middle of the night. Brothers Jake and Duncan are saved by Lester. They are devastated to find their parents shot dead and watch helplessly as their house burns to the ground. Years later, the Dalton gang meets up with Jake, who is working in a saloon. After losing one of their members in a gun fight, the gang realizes they won't have enough manpower for their upcoming train heist. At the objection of his older brother Duncan, Jake volunteers and the gang is forced to use him as a substitute. The gang successfully pulls off the train heist, but instead of gold, the chest they steal reveals a young woman inside named Pearl. She claims she was taken from her home in Potemkin. She also claims there would be a handsome reward for the gang if they return her home. Duncan is wounded by a pinkerton's bullet. The gang travel to Potemkin with Pearl and arrive at the town brothel in order to get help for Duncan, who is slowly dying. The gang is welcomed by Maria, the leader of the brothel. They drink and partake in the pleasures of the town-women. Maria sits Jake down and shows him her past, where she was burned at the stake as a witch while pregnant with Pearl. The women transform into their true selves, hideous burnt witches and attack the gang, some of which are killed off. The remaining survivors fall back to a cabin to strategize an escape. Maria gathers her fellow witches and reveal that Jake is the one who can sustain them for many more years, as he's never taken a life and is virgin, innocent blood. Jake and Dodd go back to the brothel to find Duncan, but he's not there. They rendezvous with the rest of the group and fight their way to a church. In a hallucinatory state, Wylie eats some broken glass. Lester reveals to Jake that the reason his family was killed was because they were thieves, and they stole their own farm. Later, Jake goes outside and finds Duncan apparently healed. But Dodd shoots him and he morphs into a flock of crows. Lester starts convulsing and vomiting a black liquid, and a black crow crawls out of his mouth, killing him. Wylie is found having cut himself all over with broken glass and is cutting out his eyes. He then slashes his own throat and dies. Dodd and Jake leave the church to escape but are ambushed and fall back to the town. Dodd takes on the witches and is killed while Jake moves forward. He comes upon Maria and Pearl, who offer Duncan's life in exchange for Jake. He takes the deal and Duncan rides off, eventually buying back his family's old farm and having a child of his own, named Jacob. A black crow sits ominously on their balcony as the sun sets.

Koontz, who also co-wrote, and produced the film. It marks Koontz's third feature film effort, the first being the 2017 horror film Camera Obscura. the second being \\"Scare Package\\". In May 2019, it was reported that production was underway in Oklahoma. Koontz has stated \\"I love the idea of mixing these two disparate worlds of horror and western, and to do so with the help of Joe and Keith Lansdale, feels like the perfect devil's playground. It's 3:10 To Yuma meets The Descent, but doused, and then set on fire with psychological horror. Once this gets going, it's relentless.\\" Release The Pale Door was released in theaters, VOD and digital HD on August 21, 2020. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 51%, based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 5.09/10. It's consensus reads, \\"Beyond The Pale Door lies an intriguing western/horror hybrid -- albeit one that struggles to fashion its halves into a compelling whole.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on reviews from 4 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Tomris Laffly from Roger Ebert.com gave the film one star out of four, criticizing the film for its performances, \\"design elements\\", and lack of original ideas. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter felt that film was too chaotic due to its poor staging and editing, as well as its unconvincing characters, and pacing. Scheck concluded his review by stating, \\"The Pale Door represents yet another stylistic mash-up that ends up less than the sum of its parts\\". Cinemalogue.com Todd Jorgenson felt that the film's admittedly intriguing concept was undermined by poor execution and blending of western and horror genre cliches. Jonathan Christian of The Playlist gave the film score C-, calling it \\"disorganized\\", and criticized the use of genre cliches, pacing, \\"unfocused\\" plot, and soundtrack. Christian, however did commend the film for its retroactive style, and attention to period detail. Becca James of The Chicago Reader called it \\"a raucous ride through a different type of wild west\\", commending the film's plot, and mixture of horror and western genre elements. The Austin Chronicles Matthew Managle gave the film three out of five stars, commending the performances, particularly Walters', and horror/western elements. Managle did criticize the film for its soundtrack, and budgetary limitations. Grant Hermanns from ComingSoon.net noted that, while the film's first half was sluggishly paced, the film's cinematography, direction, and performances from the rest of its cast more than made up for it's shortcomings. Michelle Swope of Dread Central rated the film four out of five stars, commending the cast, direction, and use of practical effects. Swope concluded her review by calling it \\"a wildly entertaining combination of great practical effects and an outstanding cast that is sure to please any horror fan.\\" References External links Category:2020 films Category:2020 horror films Category:2020 independent films Category:2020s Western (genre) films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American Western (genre) horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films shot in Oklahoma Category:Weird West Category:Works by Joe R.

She was the first woman to be employed as a chemist at Dow Chemical Company. During her time at Dow, she made a number of major contributions, holding more than two dozen patents as a result of her research. Stoesser developed a dry cleaning fluid that used perchloroethylene and was safer than the naphtha-based solvents then in use. She was the first to explore the use of organic acid inhibitors to stimulate production in oil wells. Organic inhibitors were much more effective than inorganics, and became the basis for a profitable subsidiary, Dowell Incorporated. Stoesser improved the quality of ethylene, ethylbenzene, and styrene to create stable polymers including polystyrene and styrofoam. Her work on styrene led to major improvements in early plastics production and to the creation of synthetic substitutes for rubber during World War II. In 1952, she co-edited the first comprehensive work on Styrene, Its Polymers, Copolymers, and Derivatives.  Early life and education  Sylvia Marie Goergen was born on July 18, 1901, to Teresa M. and George J. Goergen of Buffalo, New York. She attended the University of Buffalo, where she received her B.S. magna cum laude in chemistry in 1923. She then attended the State University of Iowa, completing her Master's thesis, The potential of the silver in silver iodide electrode in 1925 and earning her Ph.D. in physical chemistry with the thesis The adsorption and catalytic properties of stannous acid in 1928. Her advisor was James Newton Pearce (1873‚Äì1936). On August 16, 1929, in Rock Creek, Maryland, she married Wesley Carl Stoesser (July 6, 1901 ‚Äì March 22, 1989), a fellow chemist who had also graduated from the University of Buffalo and the University of Iowa.  Career  Prior to her marriage, she was hired to study sugar at the National Bureau of Standards. She and Richard F. Jackson were given the task of finding a sweetener suitable for people with diabetes. They were the first to prepare Difructose anhydride I. In July 1928, Wesley Stoesser was hired to work in the Organic Lab at the Dow Chemical Company. In 1929, Stoesser was hired as well. She was the first woman to become a scientist at Dow, and was hired directly by Herbert Henry Dow, rather than going through the usual interview and hiring process. According to one account, Wesley confided to Grace A. Dow that Sylvia would only marry and move if she had a job in her field, and Grace interceded with her husband Henry. According to the Stoessers' daughter, Judith Jaastad (later Siembieda), only the two couples knew that the new hire was a woman before she walked into the Physical Research Laboratory to start work. Stories also suggest that she was assigned to Dow's Physical Research Laboratory because at that time, it was near a library, the only building with washroom facilities for women. At the time of her hiring in 1929, she was the only person with a Ph.D. in Dow's Physical Research Laboratory. Contemporaries emphasize that she was willing to help anyone who asked, making her expertise available both within and across departments. She was referred to as the \\"nasal chemist\\" because she could identify many of the ingredients in an unknown laboratory mixture by smelling it. After her daughter's birth in 1940, Stoesser was no longer employed on the Dow staff as a research chemist. However, she continued to consult for Dow.  Research  While working for Dow, Stoesser registered at least twenty-six patents. She helped to develop products including dry cleaning solvents, saran, polystyrene, styrofoam, high-pressure lubricants, and organic inhibitors for use in oil wells. One patent was held solely in her name. The rest list fifteen different co-owners, reflecting her extensive involvement in projects at Dow. One patent includes her husband as a co-owner. = Acid inhibitors = Five of Stoesser's patents involved the use of acid inhibitors to increase crude oil production in oil wells, a type of well stimulation. The flow of oil wells had been stimulated by the addition of acids as early as 1865, but acids tended to damage well casings and other equipment. Approached in 1932, John Grebe of Dow insisted that any acid used to improve oil well production must include an inhibitor to mitigate corrosion. One of several scientists tasked with developing effective inhibitors, Stoesser is credited as the \\"key inventor\\" of second-state inhibitors, achieving \\"the second great milestone in the history of acidizing\\" due to her work in 1932‚Äì1933. Her work was \\"particularly important\\" because she shifted focus from inorganic to organic compounds, seeking something that would produce a protective film on metallic surfaces. The organic inhibitors (including mercaptans) that she discovered were much more effective than the inorganics previously tried (arsenic acid and copper salts). Burgeoning demand for oil well treatment led to the creation of the Dow Well Service, which became the subsidiary Dowell Incorporated in November 1932. Stoesser's inhibitor research was essential to the creation and success of Dowell. Another problem that affected wells was the buildup of substances that clogged the well and restricted production. Stoesser and L. C. Chamberlain developed an organic solvent mixture that could be used to remove built-up paraffin deposits. Marketed as Dowell Paraffin Solvent, it contained carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, and petroleum naphtha. It was a very successful product for Dowell. Stoesser and John Grebe may also have described the first known case of the technique that is now called hydraulic fracturing. = Cleaning solvents = Another of Stoesser's assignments was to study cleaning solvents such as naphtha. Naphtha posed a combustion risk, and attempts were being made to ban its use. Stoesser developed an alternative dry cleaning fluid using perchloroethylene that was non-flammable and non-explosive. She also developed inhibitors that helped to prevent metal corrosion in the dry-cleaning equipment. = Styrene, polystyrene, and styrofoam = Twelve of Stoesser's patents relate to the development of early plastics in the 1930s. Stoesser was responsible for significant improvements in plastics production. Dow wanted to find ways to use benzene. Benzene reacted with ethylene to form the liquid hydrocarbon ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene could be hydrogenated to form the flammable liquid monomer styrene. Styrene could be used to make the hydrocarbon polymer polystyrene. The Dow Physics Laboratory began working with styrene in 1931. Styrene was difficult to process. Reactions were highly sensitive to even small differences in temperature, and styrene was capable of reacting with itself and releasing additional heat. Even in very small amounts, some of the compounds that were produced during processing could contaminate the desired end products of the reactions. As a result, polymers made from styrene were not stable: they tended to craze and change color over time. Stoesser took on the analytical work of testing the quality of the styrene and the polymers that were created. She also studied the effects of various inhibitors on the processes. After recommending the purchase and use of a special rotary Podbielnick still, and distilling the styrene six times, she was able to successfully produce small quantities of pure styrene for use as a standard. This demonstrated that it was possible to make a pure form which was stable. Stoesser's work was essential in identifying points in the process where contamination or uncontrolled heating caused impurities. Impurities due to traces of a sulfur compound were eventually tracked back to production of the original ethylene, from which they were transferred to ethylbenzene and styrene. Working with Jim Pierce, Stoesser developed an inhibitor to produce a polystyrene of extremely high quality. This was a key step towards a low-cost commercial process for polymerization of the polystyrene Styron and a related plastic called Styraloy. Styron was crystal-clear and could be colored. Styrene was important in creating synthetic substitutes for rubber, which were of great strategic importance in World War II. It also had great commercial importance. Styron, a polystyrene, was the first of the modern plastics. It became Dow's number one product in both sales volume and earnings, during Dow's first century. In 1941, Dow company developed processes for extruding polystyrene to form foam polystyrene, also known as Styrofoam. Stoesser contributed the brief reminiscence \\"A stimulating group\\" to the edited collection A History of the Dow Chemical Physics Lab : the freedom to be creative (1990). She describes the atmosphere created in her group, directed by John Grebe: Stoesser co-edited Styrene, Its Polymers, Copolymers, and Derivatives (1952) with Ray H. Boundy and Raymond F. Boyer. Stoesser is credited by Boundy as having been the primary writer of the two-volume work.  Volunteer work  Stoesser was the first woman to be elected to the Midland, Michigan, school board (1950‚Äì1958). She was a volunteer at the Midland hospital and at the King's Daughters Home for the Elderly.  Recognition  Stoesser died in Midland, Michigan, on March 17, 1991. On August 12, 1991, the Dow Chemical Company first aired a 30-second television commercial, \\"Inspiration\\", as part of its ‚ÄúDow lets you do great things‚Äù campaign. The commercial highlighted Stoesser's achievements as the first woman scientist at Dow. The Dow newsletter, Dow Today quoted from the script: \\"Dr. Stoesser created a new career path for women, and for her company... the same company that leads the nation in patents granted to women over the last decade.\\" Stoesser was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame as of October 22, 1992, as announced in the Midland Daily News of July 5, 1992. As of 2000, with the support of alumna Yulan Tong and Dow AgroSciences, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois established a lecture series for the Sylvia M. Stoesser Lecturer in Chemistry, which recognizes women from outside academia who have made outstanding contributions. In 2017, at the opening of the Global Dow Center in Midland, Michigan, the Dow Chemical Company announced that its Employee Development Center would be renamed the Stoesser Center.

Grown as an ornamental plant, it is very similar in appearance to Alternanthera dentata, which is listed as one of this species's synonyms. Description Flowers It is an erect, sprawling, herbaceous plant that may grow up to 3 metres tall, though it is usually less than 1 metre as a cultivated plant. The plant's stems, which range between red, green and purple, are delicately hirsute when juvenile, though they'd become glabrescent as they get older. Its opposite leaves, which are 1‚Äì10 cm long and 0.7‚Äì5 cm wide, are usually coloured purple-specked or luminous reddish- purple.Alternanthera brasiliana It may lose some of its leaves in winter, making it partially \\"deciduous\\" in places that have slightly cool winters. Its vanilla-coloured, pom-pom flowers are ordered in compact clusters (7‚Äì20 mm long) in the top leaf branching and are small in shape. These clusters are rounded to slightly lengthened in shape and are foaled on stalks which are normally 3‚Äì10 cm long. It can flower any time of the year, but in temperate and cooler subtropical climates it flowers more often in winter.Purple weed is a monsterby News Mail, Ian Read, 23rd Jun 2015 Its very small brown fruit (1.5‚Äì2 mm long) contains one seed that's generally hidden within the older flower parts.Purple joyweed Alternanthera brasiliana Cultivation It is used as an ornamental plant with many cultivars, such as 'Purple Prince' and 'Little Ruby' (this name is also used for the similar-looking Alternanthera dentata cultivars). It is often harvested from the wild for regional use as a food and medicine, where it is used as an antiviral and anti-diarrhoea agent. It grows in full sun in moist, well drained soils, where it will multiply by self-seeding. It can also be easily propagated by cuttings. Range The plant is native to Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guyanas, Nicaragua, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico and the Caribbean. Moreover, it is naturalised in the wilderness and cultivated land in west Africa, coastal districts of northern and eastern Australia, Florida, South Africa, some of the Pacific Islands, and in shaded ravine slopes and creeks in Java. Most species of joyweed, including this one, are considered as environmental weeds in Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia.

Founding  In May 1955, a first informal meeting of survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp took place in Israel, the participants of which decided to found an educational institution. In 1966 the Association was formed to commemorate the martyrs of Theresienstadt, whose members were former prisoners of the Theresienstadt concentration camp now living in Israel, including former members of Zionist youth organisations. The association did not only aim at meetings of the survivors, but also at the founding of an educational institution. This institution was to keep the memory of the murdered alive, especially that of the victims of the HeHalutz and their leading member Jacob Edelstein, the first Judenrat of the Theresienstadt ghetto. One motivation for setting up Beit Terezin was that the communist government of Czechoslovakia avoided commemorating the Holocaust. Therefore the Theresienstadt Small Fortress became a national memorial for the victims of fascism, but neither here nor on the commemorative plaque in the city were the murdered Jews explicitly mentioned. The Pinkas Synagogue in Prague, which served as the national memorial site for the murdered Jews of Czechoslovakia from 1960 to 1968, had not been open since the Prague Spring of 1968. In its first meetings, the preparatory committee dealt with fundamental questions such as the opening of the association for all survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp or only for the members of Hechaluz. A further question was whether only the victims who died in Theresienstadt or those who were murdered in other camps after imprisonment in Theresienstadt should be remembered here. In 1966, when the Association for the Remembrance of the Martyrs of Theresienstadt was formally recognised, the members met in caf√©s or in the offices of members who had access to suitable rooms due to their professional activities. It was agreed that there was an urgent need for rooms for meetings, commemorations, and for the storage of documents and research documents. In the mid-1960s many survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp lived in Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud). In addition, many Jews from Germany and Austria and members of the Zionist youth organisations, who had often lost relatives in Theresienstadt, were among the founders of the Kibbutz. This group of people was benevolent towards the establishment of a memorial or educational institution on the land of the kibbutz. In addition, it was the wish of the Association that Beit Terezin be established in the midst of a living community and not far from civilization. The choice of the Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud) was additionally favoured by its central location - at that time only a few of the members of the association scattered all over Israel had a motor vehicle, most of them relying on public transportation. After all, Jakob Edelstein, who was generally revered and murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp, wanted to settle in the then undivided Kibbutz Givat Haim after emigrating to Palestine. Because the kibbutz was to use rooms in Beit Terezin for its own cultural events from the very beginning, the association was assigned a building site in the middle of the kibbutz. Founding members of the association were the Israeli journalist and translator Ruth Bondy, a survivor of the Holocaust and former prisoner of the Theresienstadt concentration camp and several other concentration camps, and the diplomat Zeev Shek, also a survivor of Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and the Kaufering remote camp of the Dachau concentration camp. Shek later became Israeli ambassador to Austria. The foundation stone was laid in 1969 and the buildings were constructed with the support of Zionist youth organisations. Beit Terezin was opened at the beginning of May 1975 on the 30th anniversary of the liberation of the Theresienstadt concentration camp by the Red Army. At this time the facility was far from complete. Therefore the memorial hall consisted only of a floor mosaic and a torah, the walls were bare. There were proposals for a modern audiovisual presentation of the ghetto's history, but the available financial means ruled it out. Following a suggestion by Albin Glaser, backlit transparencies with accompanying texts were attached to the walls to illustrate the development of the ghetto. It took until 1974 to bring the exhibition to its desired Display.  Buildings  Sign at the entrance of Beit Terezin Interior view of the Rotunda Beit Terezin's planning had to take into account the limited financial means of the association in memory of the martyrs of Theresienstadt. The design of the complex was developed by the architect Albin Glaser, himself a survivor of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His design is an interior in simple architecture, the rooms of which can be used for a variety of purposes. The central element is the twelve-sided rotunda made of reddish-brown bricks, whose ground plan and material are intended to remind us of the Theresienstadt fortress, which originally served as a memorial hall and place of remembrance. Today it is the main room of the Beit Theresienstadt Museum and the core of Beit Terezin with its permanent exhibition. For use by the Kibbutz, a library with a reading room and a small hall for lectures and cultural events were built. For Beit Terezin itself, the complex includes an archive, a reading room and a lecture hall. Glaser's original planning included a building to house the documents about the Theresienstadt concentration camp that Zeev Shek had compiled in Prague immediately after the Second World War on behalf of the Jewish Agency for Israel and brought to Israel. These documents were initially housed for years at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and were to form the basis of the Beit Terezin archive. At the instigation of the then Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Scharet, whose secretary was Zeev Shek at the time, the documents on the Holocaust were not to be distributed among many small institutions, but stored centrally. Therefore, Shek handed the documents over to Yad Vashem. The resulting renunciation of a documentation and study center led to a dispute within the association. In the end, smaller premises were created to house the archive, without competing in any way with Yad Vashem or other large institutions. A second conflict over the design of Beit Terezin concerned the floor mosaic of the rotunda planned by Glaser. The design depicted the path network and the buildings of the Theresienstadt ghetto and its realisation cost 100,000 Israeli pounds. Within the association the costs were criticized, some members saw the amount better invested in education and research. In addition to the financial aspect, it was argued that the visual representation would be understood only by the survivors of the ghetto, while other members were convinced that the detailed representation of the ghetto's streets, paths, and buildings would preserve the atmosphere of oppression for future generations. Finally, the mosaics were made according to Glaser's design in Kibbutz Givat HaShlosha, and the design is generally accepted.  Exhibitions  Exhibition room of Bei Terezin with children's drawings The theme of the permanent exhibition is the occupation of the Czech Republic by National Socialist Germany from 1939 to 1945, in particular the history of the Jews in the Theresienstadt Ghetto from November 1941 to May 1945. Other exhibitions include works by artists from the ghetto. In 2009, a special exhibition on the Theresienstadt football league was prepared under the title Liga Terez√≠n. Oded Breda, then director of Beit Terezin, supported director Michael Schwartz and cameraman Avi Kanner in the production of their documentary film Liga Terez√≠n from 2013, in which they tell the story of the football matches in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Also with the support of Beit Terezin, the German Football Museum, opened in 2015, created part of the permanent exhibition in memory of the Theresienstadt football league and Julius Hirsch and other persecuted and murdered Jewish footballers. Beit Terezin has created two exhibitions that are particularly aimed at children and young people. The first exhibition, entitled \\"They called him a friend\\", deals with the children's magazine \\"Kamar√°d\\" of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, in which contributions written or drawn by children about their everyday experiences with hunger, death, illness, dirt and overcrowding of the camp were published. In addition to the description of the magazine with exhibits, the fates of the authors up to their murder in the Auschwitz concentration camp are presented. A second exhibition is entitled \\"Sport and Youth in Theresienstadt\\". The exhibition is dedicated to the many sporting activities of children and young people in the concentration camp and refers in particular to the importance of sport for the education and value education of young prisoners. In 2011 Beit Terezin was accredited as the 54th Museum and Third Holocaust Museum of the State of Israel.  Educational center  The Beit Terezin Education Centre was opened in 1993 and is dedicated to researching and documenting the Holocaust. For this purpose, events and seminars are offered for pupils of all ages. Other seminars are aimed at students of various disciplines, members of the Israel Defence Forces, teachers and other multipliers and pensioners. The topics dealt with in the events include the history and fate of Central European Jewry, the measures to establish the ghetto and the \\"final solution\\", the internal resistance, the function of sport in the camp, the maintenance of educational institutions under the most difficult circumstances, art as a means of survival and more. Beit Terezin organizes the Annual Hana Greenfield Writing Competition, an annual writing competition for young people named after Hana Greenfield, an Israeli writer and survivor of the concentration camps Theresienstadt, Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen  Archives  The Beit Terezin archive is one of the four most important archives with material on the Theresienstadt concentration camp, along with the archives of Yad Vashem, the Jewish Museum in Prague and the archive of the Theresienstadt Memorial. Numerous archival materials come from the private collections of survivors, including diaries, photographs, materials for school lessons in the concentration camp, pictures and other works of art. Numerous documents were donated to the Beit Terezin archive. Thanks to his good contacts, Zeev Shek was able to obtain a copy of an index containing the data of more than 162,000 Jewish prisoners of the Theresienstadt concentration camp from Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and other European countries. The index was produced in Prague immediately after the Second World War. This index was invaluable during the Cold War, especially since the Czechoslovak government had broken off diplomatic relations and severely restricted the exchange of information after Israel's victory in the Six-Day War in 1967, as had all the Eastern bloc states. This index forms the core of Beit Terezin's archive and information about the fate of missing persons is still provided to their relatives upon request. In addition to the aforementioned index, Shek succeeded in taking the archives of Hechaluz Theresienstadt to Palestine. He initially handed the material over to the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, most of which was handed over to Yad Vashem in 1976. Extensive photographic material from this collection is in the Beit Terezin archive.  Staff  In the early years almost all the work, from the construction of Beit Terezin, the administration, the guided tours through the exhibition to the educational events, was carried out by volunteers. In most cases these were survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and to a lesser extent residents of the kibbutz and other volunteers. The administration of the Kibbutz Givat Haim (Ihud) assigned Pinda Shefa (until 1982) and Aliza Schiller (until 1998), two members of the Kibbutz and Theresienstadt survivors, to run Beit Terezin. The age and deaths of the members of the first generation and the steadily increasing workload made it necessary to fill the management of Beit Terezin full-time from 1998. Today, permanent staff are employed for various tasks in the museum, educational sector and archive.  Sponsoring association  Beit Terezin is still under the auspices of the Association for the Remembrance of the Martyrs of Theresienstadt (Theresienstadt (Terezin) Martyrs Remembrance Association). In the beginning, the association was made up of survivors of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. However, the association gradually opened up, first by welcoming the \\"second generation\\", children of survivors born after the liberation of their parents. In 1997, the statutes of the association established the representation of the \\"second generation\\" in all committees of the association. Today any member who is willing to support the work and goals of Beit Terezin can become a member.  Newsletter Dapei Kesher  Since 1976, Beit Terezin has published the semi-annual newsletter Dapei Kesher. The purpose of this publication is to maintain contact and exchange information about Beit Terezin between members of the (Terezin) Martyrs Remembrance Association spread all over the world. Further contents refer to the history of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, with information on meetings of survivors, congresses, exhibitions, cultural events, publications of books and media from all over the world. Since the first editions publication, the Dapei Kesher was published by Ruth Bondy for more than 20 years.

Funded by USAID, it records major incidents from 1997 to present, of attacks on humanitarian workers worldwide. As cited in the New York Times, ‚Äúit is widely regarded as an authoritative reference for aid organisations and governments in assessing trends in security threats.‚Äù Since its inception in 2005 as the first fully comprehensive compilation of this data, the AWSD has been a source of quantitative evidence on matters related to the security of humanitarian operations in conflict, referenced in policy debates and cited in official United Nations statements, United Nations General Assembly resolutions, United Nations Security Council documents, and reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The data, which is openly available for searching and downloading, is regularly relied upon by other databases in the humanitarian crisis analysis community, such as ACLED. It has also been cited in US Congressional and State Department documents and UK Parliament reports, as well as by major media outlets including: The Associated Press, BBC News, The New York Times, Reuters, The Economist, Al Jazeera, El Pais, The Guardian, The Irish Times, La Figaro, La Monde, Scientific American, Christian Science Monitor, and National Public Radio.  History  The AWSD was developed by Humanitarian Outcomes partners Abby Stoddard and Adele Harmer, then at New York University‚Äôs Center on International Cooperation and the Overseas Development Institute‚Äôs Humanitarian Policy Group, respectively. The first published research using this data was a 2006 report titled Providing Aid in Insecure Environments, by Stoddard, Harmer, and a colleague, Katherine Haver. This report provided statistical analysis, finding attacks on aid workers worldwide nearly doubled between 1997 and 2005 in absolute terms, and rose by 20 percent in terms of per capita rates.  Data  From the website, customizable search options allow for users of the data to download Excel csv formats with relevantly sorted information. An API is also available. The online dataset contains security incidents (attacks) from 1997 to present, and is updated in real time. = Parameters = Attacks against aid workers recorded in the AWSD are defined as ‚Äúmajor,‚Äù including intentional killings, kidnappings, serious sexual assault/rape, and attacks causing serious injury. The definition of an aid worker is also limited to those working in emergency contexts to provide humanitarian relief (as opposed to political, developmental or other assistance). The aid worker victims are employees, or contractors and consultants, of not-for-profit aid agencies. All organisations and victim names are kept confidential and not included in the public data. This choice was made because victim information is not available for all incidents, and those close to the victims may not wish to have the names published. The information that is publicly available for each incident is as follows: * Date of incident * Location (country/province/city) and geocodes * Gender * Aid organisation affiliation (UN/Red Cross/NGO/Other) * National or international staff * Type of intentional act (killing/wounding/kidnapping/rape) * Type of violence ( e.g. assault, shooting, IED, aerial bombardment) * Attack situation (e.g. ambush, armed incursion, individual attack) *Perpetrator (e.g. non-state armed group, police, criminal) * Public description: who, what, when, where, why (when available) = Sources = The AWSD engages with a variety of sources to ensure completeness of the dataset. Each incident publicly lists one of the following sources; * Media: using a media filtering tool developed as an internet data scraper for Humanitarian Outcomes * Official report: provided directly by regional and global security entities/consortiums, or by aid organisations official reports/press releases * Focal point: security personnel within organisations affected by an incident against a staff member. (Victim self-reporting is also put in this category) = Verification = Annually, all incidents from the previous year are comprehensively verified with agencies who work in the humanitarian sector, to ensure all the details are accurately reflected in the database. The team works with 100 NGO/INGO and UN agencies per year in order to confirm, update, and collect additional incident data, and to source additional incidents that may not have been previously captured via other means. Each year the verified numbers are presented in the Aid Worker Security Report, which is published on the Humanitarian Outcomes website and publicly available. This verified data also supports and helps define the theme of the annual report, which is on a topic that is significant to the humanitarian community or highlighted by trends supported by the data. An easily digestible one-page fact sheet, Figures at Glance, is also usually published in August and highlights the findings from the previous years verified data.

It was founded by the Cherokee Nation in 2001 for the purpose of preserving the heavily endangered Cherokee language. Students must be members of a federally recognized tribe, and an application process is used as class size is limited. After finishing at the Cherokee Immersion School, students typically transfer to an affiliated school for grades 7 and 8. Attending the immersion school can help students enroll into Sequoyah High School (grades 9 through 12). Total enrollment was reported to be 141 in August 2018. Background There were 1,520 Cherokee speakers out of 376,000 Cherokee in 2018 according to Ethnologue, which classified the language as \\"moribund\\", meaning children are not learning and speaking the language. Only a handful of people under 40 years of age are fluent, and about 8 speakers die each month. In 2018, 1,200 speakers were present in the Cherokee Nation and 101 were present in the United Keetoowah Band. The Kituwah (Middle or Eastern) dialect, which is taught at New Kituwah Academy in North Carolina, was known by ~220 Eastern Band Cherokee in 2018. In June 2019, the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes declared a state of emergency for the language due to the threat of it going extinct, calling for the enhancement of revitalization programs. A tally by the three tribes had garnered a list of ~2,100 remaining speakers at that time.

During the Boer War he was in charge of the Edinburgh South African Hospital, an experience which impressed upon him the importance of the Red Cross movement in reducing and mitigating the horrors of war. Becoming active in the British Red Cross Society, he was instrumental in forming the Edinburgh branch and was its Chairman for over 30 years. He was knighted in 1920 and elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1921.

He was educated at Dollar Academy going on to Edinburgh University medical school and graduating MB, CM from the University of Edinburgh in 1884. After posts in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) as house surgeon under Professor John Chiene and house physician under Professor John Wylie, he trained as a surgeon, initially working as a demonstrator in anatomy. He then trained for some years under Professor Chiene and it was at this time that his interest in urological surgery developed. He passed the examinations to become M.R.C.S. Eng. in 1886 and the next year became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd). He became assistant surgeon in the RIE In 1892.  War service  Wallace saw service in the Boer War as Surgeon in charge of the Edinburgh Hospital in South Africa. This 100-bed hospital opened at Norvalspont in the Northern Cape in May 1890. It remained in service until October 1891, when it was given over to Government. During this campaign Wallace was mentioned in despatches, was awarded the South African Medal and clasp and was appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). His wartime experience had shown him the importance of the British Red Cross Society and he was instrumental in founding the Edinburgh branch and was to become its Honorary Secretary or Chairman for more than 30 years. In 1908 he joined the recently formed Territorial Force, and, along with several other RIE surgeons, including Sir Joseph Cotterill, Charles W Cathcart, George A Berry and Alexis Thomson, he was a member of the surgical staff of the 2nd Scottish General Hospital at Craigleith (later the Western General Hospital). The hospital was mobilised in 1914, but it was felt that because of his knowledge and experience of the Red Cross Society, he could make a greater contribution to the war effort by working in that organisation. He was Red Cross Commissioner for South East Scotland, a post regarded by many as more demanding than an Army command. This involved organising and supervising the many convalescent homes which had been established in south-east Scotland.  Later career  Wallace had been appointed surgeon in charge of wards in 1908 and held this post for the standard fifteen years. In 1923 he became consulting surgeon. Although a general surgeon he had developed an interest in urological surgery from an early stage. He was regarded as a popular surgical teacher attracting large numbers of students to his surgical classes. After retiring from the RIE he became for many years surgeon to the Edinburgh Hospitals for Incurables, later Longmore Hospital. He died in 1952.  Honours and awards  Wallace received many honours. He was elected to the French Association of Urology and was President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1921 to 1923. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the City of Edinburgh. The University of Edinburgh awarded him the Honorary degree of LLD. For his services he was appointed C.B.E. in 1918 and K.B.E. in 1920.  Family  In 1905 he married Augusta Maud Clouston, daughter of Sir Thomas Clouston.Scotland's people. Marriages 1905 . Edinburgh, St Giles. Ref: 685/4 233 They had two sons.

She is the first female professor of engineering at the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Laval University, and is an expert in hydraulic turbine technology, hydrodynamics, and fluid mechanics. Early life and education While she was in a CEGEP program, Desch√™nes' father passed away and her mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Desch√™nes completed two years of CEGEP in psychology, before taking a year off to take care of her mother, and then completed a CEGEP year in the mathematics, physics, and biology stream. Later on, she pursued mechanical engineering during her undergraduate degree, and cites her reasons for going into science to include the desire to have a stable career as she may have to help her siblings one day. Desch√™nes was the only woman in her undergraduate program, and went on to do a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Universit√© Laval. Upon receiving a scholarship to study abroad, Desch√™nes pursued a PhD at the Institut National Politechnique de Grenoble in France, where she studied computational fluid dynamics in hydraulic turbines, and completed her degree in January 1990 before returning to her Universit√© Laval to become the first female professor of engineering at the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Career Desch√™nes founded the Laboratoire de Machines Hydrauliques (LAMH) in 1989, which is a centre for hydraulic turbines research. In 2007, Desch√™nes created the Consortium en machines hydrauliques, which is an academic-industry collaboration, including Hydro Qu√©bec and Natural Resources Canada, to carry out research on high-power hydraulic turbines. Desch√™nes and the Consortium have received support from industry and federal grants (including those from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and NSERC Collaborative Research and Development grants) to purchase equipment and carry out collaborative research, such as analysing 3D turbine flow patterns with computer simulations, and investigating factors which influence durability of low-head turbines. Desch√™nes' findings have led to a better understanding of turbines and hydro-electric technology. Between 1997 and 2006, Desch√™nes served as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Alcan International Limited Chair for Women in Science and Engineering at Universit√© Laval. She has co-founded three non-profit organizations to support and promote women in science and engineering: the International Network for Women Engineers and Scientists (INWES), the Association de la francophonie √† propos des femmes en sciences, technologies, ing√©nierie et math√©matiques (AFFESTIM), and the INWES Educational and Research Institute (ERI). Desch√™nes has received multiple honours and awards. Of note, in 2015, Desch√™nes received the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council's Synergy Award for Innovation, in the partnership category, in recognition of her effective collaborations between industry and academia. She is a fellow of Engineers Canada (2015), and been named a Le Soleil and Radio- Canada laureate twice (in the science and research category). She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Ottawa in 2016. On 27 June 2019, Desch√™nes was appointed a member of the Order of Canada for her \\"contributions to mechanical engineering research and teaching, and for championing women in science and engineering.\\" On September 21, 2019, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke.

The company provides what it calls ‚Äúmiddle office‚Äù solutions, utilizing artificial intelligence to optimize various financial and commercial functions, such as quote-to-cash, revenue management, and e-commerce management. Apttus‚Äô software was originally developed to leverage the Salesforce customer relationship management platform, but it has since been integrated with Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud as well. In September 2018, private equity firm Thoma Bravo purchased a majority stake in Apttus. This resulted in significant turnover in the executive ranks, as Thoma Bravo installed a new CEO, CFO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief People Officer, Vice President of Finance, and Corporate Controller by the end of 2018.  History  Apttus was founded in 2006 by Kirk Krappe, Neehar Giri, and Kent Perkocha. The three co-founders reportedly developed the company from ideas written down on napkins in a laundry room. Krappe served as the company's first CEO, with Giri as Chief Solutions Officer and Perkocha as Chief Customer Officer. The company was bootstrapped and took no outside funding until 2013, when it raised $37 million in Series A financing from a group of investors including K1 Capital, ICONIQ, and Salesforce. By the time of its 2018 buyout, Apttus had received a total of $404 million in investment capital from five rounds of fundraising, which gave the company a valuation of approximately $1.3 billion, as of September 2016. Despite publicly discussing the likelihood of an initial public offering in 2016, Apttus never went public before being acquired by Thoma Bravo. The 2015 acquisition of Apttus rival SteelBrick by Salesforce, an early Apttus investor, was widely blamed for Apttus‚Äô inability to complete an IPO or find a buyer at more favorable terms. Thoma Bravo took a majority stake in Apttus in September 2018. The cost of the purchase was not revealed.  Controversy  In July 2018, Krappe departed Apttus with little warning, a move later reported to have been driven by accusations of sexual assault and misrepresentations of the company's financial performance. The allegations, which became public on November 1, 2018 with the publication of a Business Insider investigative piece, highlighted a company sales retreat at the One&Only; Palmilla resort near Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, during which Krappe reportedly sexually assaulted a 26-year-old female business development employee. Other allegations accused Krappe of presenting misleading data on Apttus‚Äô size and financial health, and at the time of the report, there were ‚Äúseveral‚Äù sexual harassment claims underway, as well as three lawsuits over the financial misrepresentation issues.

The game put emphasis on both exploration and combat as the player character, an android gardener named Vesper, traverses an alien planet from a first- person perspective. The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. Gameplay The game is an action-adventure game played from a first-person perspective. In the game, the player controls Vesper, an android gardener who was taking care of an alien planet until it was shot by an alien faction named The Temptest. The player's main goal is to take revenge on the Tempest by constructing a new body and collect upgrades. The game features an open world that the player can freely explore. Vesper is equipped with various gadgets that aid exploration and climbing, such as the Slipstream Thruster, which is a jetpack that allows players to rocket through the game's environments. The android is equipped with a variety of futuristic weapons such as SMG and shotguns to defeat enemies. Once an enemy is defeated, they will drop scrap resources than can be used to craft weapon upgrades. After the player finishes the game's story, the game entered a mode named Cycling World, in which the game's locations and missions are reset every week via procedural generation. The game can also be played cooperatively with other players. Development The exploration aspect of the game was inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while the combat component was inspired by Insomniac's own Ratchet & Clank series and Sunset Overdrive. Insomniac had previously developed three VR games, including Edge of Nowhere, Feral Rights and The Unspoken, and the studio hoped to apply their experience working on these games into Stormland. According to Chad Dezern, Insomniac's Chief Creative Officer, the game \\"[stays] in first-person from start to finish\\" to avoid taking agency away from players, while Mike Daly, the game's lead designer, stated that the Cycling World mode was designed to \\"[sustain] a player‚Äôs interest perpetually\\". Publisher Oculus Studios had high hope for the title as the game was significantly different from other major Oculus games, which were mainly arcade game or story-focused experiences. Oculus announced the game on June 7, 2018 and released the game on November 14, 2019 for its VR headset Oculus Rift. Reception Stormland received generally positive reviews from critics upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic. For IGN, Gabriel Moss wrote that the story was \\"decently told\\" though it was not the game's \\"main draw\\". However, he noted that he was impressed by the game's movement mechanics and world design. Meanwhile, Samuel Horti from PC Gamer praised the game's combat system, though he disliked the quest structure for being too repetitive.

It is often the dominant tree species of the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. The timber is traded as limbali, and is used for construction, flooring and railway sleepers. It is also used for making boats, furniture, tool handles and joinery and for making charcoal. Description Gilbertiodendron dewevrei is a large evergreen tree, reaching a height of up to . The crown is dense and allows little light through. The unbuttressed trunk is cylindrical, with a diameter of up to or more, the lower half usually being devoid of branches. The bark is rough, greyish-brown or yellowish brown, peeling off in large flakes. The leaves are pendulous and leathery, the underside being covered with papillae, and they often have a few glands near the margins. They are alternate and pinnate with two to five pairs of leaflets. Each leaflet is ovate or elliptical, the lower leaflets being smaller than the terminal ones; they have rounded or cordate bases and obtuse apices. The inflorescence is a loose terminal or axillary panicle clad with red hairs, the individual flowers being fragrant and having parts in fives. The sepals are purplish-red and fused at the base. The petals are unequal, one being deeply two-lobed and red, while the remainder are lanceolate. The fruits are flattened, woody pods, long by wide, with longitudinal ridges, and covered with short, dense, brown hairs. The seeds are shiny brown, oblong to triangular, flattened and up to in diameter. Distribution and habitat Gilbertiodendron dewevrei is native to tropical forests in Central Africa, its range including Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo and northern Angola. It occurs in areas with an average annual precipitation of and a short dry season, at altitudes of up to . It often grows in nearly pure, single species stands. Ecology The seeds of this tree are eaten by various mammals including rodents, pigs, duikers, African buffaloes, elephants, gorillas and humans. The seeds are spread when the pods split explosively. The tree casts dense shade and this suppresses herbs and undergrowth on the forest floor, but is tolerated by the tree's own seedlings and saplings to the exclusion of other species. However, the pure stands of this tree are very sensitive to habitat disturbance; the felling of trees allows more light to reach the forest floor and the seedlings of G. dewevrei are outperformed by those of other, faster growing species of tree. This tree has an ectomycorrhizal relationship with fungi that grow on its roots, particularly Pulveroboletus bembae. Several species of comet orchid grow on Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, including Angraecum distichum, Angraecum subulatum, Angraecum aporoides, and Angraecum podochiloides, and on fallen trees and branches, Angraecum gabonense. Uses The timber has many uses in construction and building, including ship building, railway sleepers, mine props, flooring, joinery, doors and window frames, agricultural implements, garden furniture, turnery and toys. It is not generally used for cabinet work or firewood, but makes good charcoal. The seeds contain certain toxic substances which can be removed by treatment. They are used for human consumption but mostly when other foods are scarce, boiled, roasted, ground into flour for making porridge or fermented and wrapped in Megaphrynium macrostachyum leaves, and subsequently roasted. The bark, leaves and sap have uses in herbal medicine, and strips of the inner bark are used to make bands for carrying baskets. In the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, whole huts are constructed from this tree, with the addition of clay; the main supports are made from branches and partitions from smaller branches, tied together with string made from the inner bark, and the roof is thatched with the tree's leaves.

Family background The Trotter family were part of the Edinburgh Merchant Company from 1691. William was born in Edinburgh on 10 November 1772 the son of Thomas Trotter (1724-1804) and his wife, Charlotte Knox.

She has also served as Chief of Staff for the United States Trade Representative in the Executive Office of the President. Early career and education Originally from California, Sullivan graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in political science from Stanford University and was a two-year MacArthur Fellow at the University of Maryland where she earned a Master's Degree in public management.http://www.onecalbank.com/ContentPage.aspx?name=biomsullivan.aspx Upon graduation, Sullivan worked as a legislative assistant for Senator Gary Hart from 1984 to 1987. After she served as Congressman Nicholas Mavroules' representative to the Armed Services Committee. She also worked on the staff of House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 1991 and as a senior policy advisor to House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt from 1992 to 1994.HUD News Release Political career =Defense= Sullivan began working as the Special Assistant, the civilian equivalent to the Chief of Staff, to Defense Secretary William Perry in 1994 where she managed the Secretary's relationship with the press corps, the White House and the United States Congress.Marinucci, p1 The press debacle during the Somalia operations of the early 1990s, the emergence of the 24-hour news cycle and the widespread adoption of the internet forced the military to alter its interaction with the press corps around military operations. Sullivan and White House advisor David Gergen coordinated the Defense Department and the U.S. military's interaction with the media during the invasion of Haiti. To protect the lives of U.S. soldiers and ensure the military's strategy was accurately understood by the media, Sullivan coordinated conference calls between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the network bureau chiefs to brief the media on what the military expected to happen each day in Haiti. According to the McCormick Tribune Foundation, this more open model of communication between the press and the military is now commonplace. Sullivan also helped manage the reorganization of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the agency that provides finance and accounting services for the civil and military members of the Department. In the mid-1990s, the agency allowed municipalities to bid on where the Department would operate DFAS centers.

The passage of Congressional legislation granting China PNTR status cleared the final hurdle for China‚Äôs accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2000 and the opening of the country to the world. According to the International Monetary Fund, China's GDP has grown at an average rate of 9.9% since being accepted to the WTO. In her role as Chief of Staff, Sullivan helped manage the USTR office‚Äôs role in negotiating the 1996 WTO Telecommunications Agreement which opened worldwide telecommunication markets to competition and set the rules that governed the emerging wireless, cable and fixed-line communications market.

Previously he was general director of Culture and Education of the province of Buenos Aires and Secretary of Educational Policies and Teaching Career in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.  Education  Finocchiaro is a graduate of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and has a master's degree in education from the University of San Andr√©s. He also holds a doctorate in history from the Universidad del Salvador. Academic career Finocchiaro is an associate professor of state theory at UBA Law School, head of contemporary international policy at the University of Business and Social Sciences (UCES), and professor of political law at the National University of La Matanza (UNLaM); he served as Dean of the College of Law and Political Science at the latter institution from 2004 to 2011. Finocchiaro has authored the books UBA c / Estado Nacional. A study on university autonomy and El mito reformista, as well as articles on international politics, education, history, and political philosophy. Political career Between 2011 and 2015, Finocchiaro served as Secretary of Educational Policies and Teaching Career in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. In December 2015 he was appointed by governor Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal as general director of Culture and Education of the province of Buenos Aires. Since July 2017 he has served as Argentina's Minister of education. Shortly after assuming his post, he decided to reduce the Our School program by canceling the plan that allowed thousands of teachers across the country to access a free postgraduate course through online training courses, starting in January 2018 with the closing of three posts. At the same time, the decree eliminated the national parity of teachers, which caused conflicts in several provinces. The conflict led to a strike and suspended the teaching of classes in the 57 national universities, covering 190,000 teachers and 1.6 million students, in addition to the 3,000 million pesos cut in public universities. In September 2018, after the reduction of ministries implemented by President Mauricio Macri, Finocchiaro was put in charge of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Technology, absorbing the former ministries of Culture and of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation. In 2019 he is running for mayor of La Matanza under the Together for Change Party. Minister of Education His greatest achievement is the arrival of technology in the classroom: he connected 19 thousand schools to the Internet and now Argentine children learn programming and robotics from kindergarten. During his tenure, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) highlighted progress that made Argentina an \\"emerging leader\\" in education. In 2018, he pointed to Argentina as one of the five countries in the world that had made the greatest progress in digital literacy and in 2019 in a document entitled \\"Artificial Intelligence in education: challenges and opportunities for sustainable development\\", highlights the Learn Connected program that promoted the Ministry of Education. Controversy On 27 June 2019, Finocchiaro strongly condemned a school in Chaco Province which displayed a Cuban flag on Argentina's Flag Day labeling the Cuban regime as \\"What differences are there between the regime of Cuba and Nazism?\\". He also described Che Guevara as a \\"criminal and genocider\\". Days later he recalled that the school was indoctrinating children with \\"communism and ideologies of totalitarian and populist governments\\"; he further said the school would be reviewed. Other activities Finocchiaro is Argentina's ambassador to the Working Group on International Cooperation for Education, Remembrance and Holocaust Research at the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. Finocchiaro produced the 2008 documentary Mujeres de la Sho√° (\\"Women of the Holocaust\\") in a joint production of the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires and the UNLaM.

The park, which is connected to the regional pathway, has a boardwalk, cycling and walking trails, the Nautilus Pond, a polishing marsh, a wet meadow, man-made streams, vantage points of the Bow River, and wildlife habitat. The $26.8 million project to \\"restore native riparian habitats\\" of the contaminated Klippert gravel pit, then known as the East Bowmont Natural Environment Park (NEP), began in 2010. It was completed in the fall of 2018 and officially opened to the public on June 26, 2019, following a ceremony in which Mayor Naheed Nenshi dedicated the park to Dale Hodges, in recognition of his many contributions to Calgary as the longest service member of council. Alderman Hodges was active for 30 years‚Äîfrom 1983 to 2013‚Äî\\"protecting and creating Calgary's green spaces\\". Features Overlooking Bowness.A City of Calgary press release described the Park as a \\"one-of-a-kind\\", \\"beautiful stormwater treatment facility\\" that filters and treats stormwater through a combination of natural and man-made processes. One of the main focuses of the project was to improve the underground storm drain system of stormwater collected from eight northwest communities, including Silver Springs and Varsity. Before the creation of Dale Hodges Park, stormwaters from these communities, representing nearly , ran through underground storm drains in the gravel pit, directly into the Bow River. According to a June 26, 2019 City of Calgary press release, Dale Hodges Park \\"is one of a kind in North America in the way that it is designed to handle and filter the stormwater...The park‚Äôs proximity to the river presented a rare and unique opportunity to protect the Bow River ...as it is estimated that the annual sediment loads to the Bow River from this area will be reduced by 50%.\\" leftThe design includes a Nautilus Pond, a polishing marsh, a wet meadow, a stream, outfall, a dry stream, riparian areas, and a lookout mound. The polishing marshes, wet meadow, and a surface stream carry the stormwater from the Nautilus Pond to the polishing marshes. The stream also collects the wet meadow stormwater and \\"conveys it to the outfall\\". The lookout knoll is encircled by the marsh with sedge and willows growing nearby. Residential snow and rain runoff travels through pipes then resurfaces in Nautilus Pond which is located at the west of the Park. Large sediment particles are removed in the pond draining system which \\"swirls the water before dropping it down a halo drain\\". rightThe water moves slowly through meandering man-made side streams in the polishing marsh area where wetland plants remove finer particles. The water flows through \\"cells\\" in the park \\"stopping at various river banks\\" that \\"polish\\" the water before it enters the Bow River. The design for the \\"sculpted polishing marshes and wet meadows\\" was a collaboration by O2 Planning + Design, Source 2 Source Inc., and Sans fa√ßon for Watershed+. According to the February 2014 East Bowmont NEP Design Development Plan, the collaborators drew their inspiration from the \\"unique riparian phenomenon\\" known as anabranches, or \\"meander[ing] scrolls, which are sections of streams that divert from and then rejoin the main channel of a watercourse. Thousands of trees, bushes and native plants were planted and seeded as part of the restoration process using phytoremediation to treat the contaminated soil from the gravel pit. In their 2012 and 2014 reports, O2 Planning + Design Inc said that phytoremediation would be used to treat the contaminated soil from the gravel pit. According to O2 Planning + Design, the \\"final outflow stream discharges to an important trout habitat area, designed to serve as refuge during river flood conditions\\". Collaborators leftThe transformation of the site, which incorporated \\"water engineering, public art, landscape architecture and ecological design\\", was the result of a collaboration between O2 Planning + Design, Source 2 Source Inc., Sans fa√ßon for Watershed+Sans Fa√ßon is a collaborative partnership that began in Glasgow c. 2001 between the English artist Tristan Surtees and French architect Charles Blanc. Since 2007, Surtees and Blanc developed and led Watershed+, which is a public art program operating out of the City of Calgary's Department of Utilities and Environmental Protection (UEP) since 2007. Watershed+ adds \\"creative practice\\" to water management in Calgary, connecting Calgarians emotionally to the Bow River watershed. In 2016, Sans Fa√ßon also worked on Seattle's Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) project. According to a November 1, 2014 article in Avenue Calgary, Surtees and Blanc, who were included in Calgary's Top 40 under 40, had created Watershed+ in 2009 as a proposal for UEP's Public Art funding. By 2014, Watershed+ had over 20 projects. and AECOM. Wilco Southwest undertook the construction. The City of Calgary departments involved in the project include Calgary Parks, Water Resources and Public art teams City of Calgary Arts and Culture. According to a February 27, 2013 article in Canadian Art, the City of Calgary's Department of Utilities and Environmental Protection (UEP) created its own public art program as a result of the City's establishment in 2004 of the City of Calgary‚Äôs Public Art Program. In According to a February 27, 2013 article in Canadian Art the City of Calgary‚Äôs Public Art Program devotes 1 per cent \\"of all project costs for municipal capital projects over one million dollars\\" to public art. By 2013, the \\"Glasgow-based collective\\" Sans fa√ßon had two commissions with UEP. Dale Hodges Park is part of a larger series of initiatives undertaken by the City of Calgary for flood mitigation strategies. Wildlife corridor Dale Hodges Park provides habitat for wildlife and is part of Bowmont Park's wildlife corridor connecting Nose Hill Park to the east, Edworthy Park and Shouldice Park downstream from Bowmont Park, and Bowness Parkand Baker Parks upstream. History Bowmont Park was expanded with the addition of the land at the east end of the park, formerly used as a gravel-mining pit, which the City of Calgary had acquired in 2010, to \\"restore the area‚Äôs ecological integrity while improving the underground storm drain system.\\" The Klippert gravel pit, a former gravel-mining pit was run by Klippert Concrete for sixty years. The area was temporarily named the East Bowmont Natural Environment Park (NEP). The City hired AECOM to undertake a scoping study, which was completed in 2010. One of the first projects in the transformation of the area from gravel pit to a restored natural area, was creation of two \\"new wet ponds\\". The wet ponds, which were both educational and functional, serve to \\"protect the Bow River by incorporating green stormwater treatment\\", according to Chris Manderson, natural area management lead with the City of Calgary parks department. By April 2014 Calgary's Recreations department said that the East Bowmont Natural Environment Park (NEP) would become a natural environment park and would \\"incorporate stormwater treatment for a large northwest Calgary drainage catchment.\\" The NEP was designated as a \\"high priority as a stormwater quality retrofit project.\\" In November 2015, the City of Calgary began the actual physical work of developing the Natural Environment Park. The project incorporates \\"green stormwater treatment as a functional element of the park\\" with \\"stormwater wetlands\\" that provide wildlife habitat\\". On April 25, 2017, Calgary's City Council officially renamed East Bowmont Natural Environment Park (NEP) Dale Hodges Park, The engineering firm AECOM Canada, a local subsidiary of Los Angeles-based AECOM, a multinational, was formerly Tecsult. in recognition of the many contributions to the city made by Alderman Dale Hodges, who had served Calgary from 1983 to 2013, making him Calgary‚Äôs longest-serving member of council. The $2,006,000 project was completed in the fall of 2018, and was officially opened by the Mayor of Calgary on June 26, 2019 at the dedication of the park to Dale Hodges. Dale Hodges Dale Hodges served as Calgary City Council Ward 1 Alderman for thirty years‚Äîfrom 1983 until his retirement in 2013. In April 2017 the city council surprised Hodges with the news that they had unanimously agreed to rename East Bowmont Park as Dale Hodges Park. Hodges worked extensively to protect and create parks including Nose Hill Park, Baker Park, and Dale Hodges Park. He also worked towards the establishment of the Enmax Legacy Parks Program which provides ongoing funds to maintain the parks.

History The mountains of Saghrou in the High Atlas: the theater of colonial military operations. Every corner of the Ait Atta region continues to remember the Battle of Bougafer. Bougafer is named after a summit of peaks of Jbel Saghro which raises to an altitude of 2275 meters. The Ait Atta tribes marked Moroccan history since they were delivered a ruthless battle in Bougafer, equal connoisseur under the name the Battle of Saghro to the French troops allied with the forces of the Sultan during the protectorate, in 1933. They resisted for 42 days against 83,000 French soldiers supported by military aircraft. The Aitta warriors were led by Assou Oubasslam and they master their environment so much that they became almost invisible. The armies of the French occupation, led by General Henri, the commander-in-chief of the French forces in Morocco, suffered heavy and humiliating losses, despite their military superiority and sophisticated weapons, but they could not withstand the courage of the Ait Atta tribes, according to David Hart in The A√Øt ‚ÄòAtta of Southern Morocco, ‚Äúthe hardest single battle which the French had ever had to fight in the course of their ‚Äòpacification‚Äô of Morocco‚Äù. After heavy losses on both sides, opponents agreed that the tribe could maintain its jurisdiction and not subject to the rule of Thami El Glaoui. An agreement was signed between the parties, which is in some of these clauses: *1 - Surrender to the Moroccan Makhzan. *2 - The removal of the authority of the Glaoui from the territory of Ait Atta. *3 - Keeping weapons in the hands of the inhabitants. *4 - Non-employment of the population in forced labor. *5 - Not forced inviting women to sing in official parties.
