Part of the volcanoes of the Marra Mountains, it lies on the Darfur dome and like the Tagabo Hills and Meidob Hills volcanism may be the consequence of a mantle plume. The highest point of Sudan (after the separation of South Sudan) lies on the margin of the caldera. The caldera lies atop a shield volcano or ash cone in the southern Marra Mountains, which developed first as a pile of basaltic lava flows and later as layers of volcanic ash and tuff, including the eruptions that formed the caldera. A large eruption occurred about 3,520 ¬± 100 years before present, and hot springs and fumaroles are active to the present day. Deriba contains two lakes, one in the northeastern side of the main caldera and the other in a cone in the southwestern sector of the Deriba caldera. The fresher southwestern lake is smaller but considerably deeper than the saltier northeastern lake; in the late Pleistocene the caldera was filled with a larger lake.  Geography and geomorphology  Map of the Deriba caldera Deriba lies in the Marra Mountains of Sudan, Africa's geographic centre; Deriba is in the southern sector of these mountains and close to the main summit thereof. The caldera rim became Sudan's new highest point, after the independence of South Sudan. The town of Nyala lies south of Deriba. Deriba is an oval, wide and deep caldera, with a volcanic cone occupying the southwestern part of the caldera floor. The rim of the caldera reaches a maximum elevation of in the southwest. The caldera is cut into volcanic ash, lapilli, lavas, obsidian and tuffs, and the floor is strewn with pumice blocks. A gap lies in the eastern caldera wall. = Lakes = Deriba contains two lakes, which are known as the \\"Deriba lakes\\". A deep lake occupies the northeastern area of the caldera, and being located in the lowest part of the caldera floor it is the sink of Deriba. In 1918 it had dimensions of , but by 1964 the size of the lake had increased. The lake is surrounded by a gradually sloping muddy beach with the exception of the northern shore. This lake is also known as the \\"female\\" lake, with green salty water. The salt consists of chloride, potassium and sodium salts. The volcanic cone has a lake as well, which is deep and smaller, with a roughly rectangular shape that extends in north-south direction. In comparison to the other lake northwest, this \\"male\\" lake had dimensions of in 1918. Steep slopes surround this lake, which is filled with fresher water. Reportedly, the local Fur people considered the lake haunted, but the lakes were also used as a source for salt. Water levels in these lakes are fairly stable from season to season although evidence for substantial fluctuations have been found. Together with several perennial streams they are thus perennial waterbodies. Around the Deriba caldera, drainage occurs either southward or westward, leading into the Bahr El-Arab of the White Nile and the Chari River of Lake Chad respectively. The lakes themselves have no surface outlets. In the past, larger lakes existed inside the Deriba caldera. The first such lake stage has been dated to 19,000 years before present when water levels rose above the present-day levels, the second 19,600 - 16,000 years before present when they were higher than currently and the third 14,000 years before present, then above present-day. Similar lake stages have been documented in Trou au Natron in Tibesti, where shifts of the position of the subtropical jet stream and the tropical depressions associated with the jet stream have been invoked as an explanation. These lake stages have left limestone deposits in the caldera, and it is likely that the lakes sometimes overflowed through the eastern caldera rim gap.  Geology  Deriba is part of Jebel Marra volcano, which together with the Tagabo Hills and the Meidob Hills is one of three volcanic fields in Darfur; these form the little known Darfur Volcanic Province. The Jebel Marra volcano is maximally wide and long in north-south direction, where the northern segment is centered around Jebel Gurgei. Jebel Marra consists of a pile of mostly basaltic lava which has been covered by pumice and volcanic ash as well as pyroclastic rocks and ignimbrites. The Deriba caldera which forms the top of the entire complex, which around Deriba has the appearance of a large ash cone or shield volcano. Other, less spectacular vents are found elsewhere in the Marra Mountains. Erosion has cut canyons into the volcanic complex. The occurrence of volcanism has been explained with a mantle plume centered between Meidob and Jebel Marra. The basement is formed by crystalline rocks, mainly metamorphosed gneisses and schists, and is a mobile belt of Panafrican age. They are in part covered by the Nubian Sandstones of Cretaceous age and aeolian sands, and by the Jebel Marra massif which occupies a surface of . Tectonic uplift of the Darfur dome commenced in the Cretaceous and resulted in a noticeable upwarp of the basement beneath Jebel Marra. Two major tectonic lineaments intersect at Jebel Marra. = Eruptive history = Volcanism in the southwestern Marra mountains took place between 4.35 million years ago and 60,000 years ago, subdivided into an Old Series and a New Series which is younger than 2 million years ago. After an initial stage, during which olivine basalt and small amounts of pyroclastic material were erupted, trachyte were emplaced. The Deriba caldera probably formed either 60,000 or 3,520 ¬± 100 years before present (BP), but activity continued with the volcanic cone inside of the caldera and peripheral vents, possibly into historical time. The 3,520 ¬± 100 BP eruption was a Plinian eruption that deposited pyroclastic material containing blocks of basement material. The ash fall from the eruption reaches thicknesses of as far as away from Deriba, while pyroclastic flows have been identified as far as from the caldera. The eruption has an estimated volcanic explosivity index of 4 and may be associated with the volcanic cone inside the caldera. The volcano was formerly considered to be extinct. Hot springs whose temperature reaches and which may be supplied by magmatic water and fumaroles, both within the caldera around the volcanic cone and in the surrounding Marra Mountains, indicate that Jebel Marra and the Deriba caldera are a dormant volcano. Reportedly, the exhalations of the fumaroles can kill birds and insects, and some fumarolic vents may have formed between 1964 and 1966, implying that the fumarolic activity may reflect a recent change of volcanic activity.  Climate  Jebel Marra has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) bordering on a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). Precipitation on Jebel Marra is about , the mountain lies at the eastern margin of the Sahel and receives more precipitation than the surrounding region. Between 12,000 and 8,000 years before present, the climate was wetter as a consequence of a northward shift of climate zones.  Biology  Vegetation around Deriba consists of grassland with scarce trees such as the wild olive. The plant life is classified as Afromontane, it also includes species from temperate climates. It is likely that past humid periods permitted the expansion of Mediterranean species into the Jebel Marra mountains. Presently, Jebel Marra may be a suitable site for agriculture. Semidesert and desert landscapes dominate the region around the Marra Mountains. Generally, the lakes are salty, oxygen poor and remote and thus contain little plant or animal life. Some vegetation grows around the smaller lake, as well as in other parts of the Deriba caldera where water is available. Copepods live in the smaller lake, while the larger one is populated by blue-green algae and rotifers. Spirulina occurs in the large lake, and Melosira and Nitzscia diatoms have been identified in the small lake. The copepod Eucyclops gibsoni has been encountered in the small lake. Among the rotifers are Brachionus dimidiatus, Brachionus plicatilis, Hexarthra jenkinae and Lecane bulla, some of which also occur in the smaller lake. Ephedra flies are widespread around the large lake, and other insects were collected on the small lake. Birds are uncommon, with greenshanks, little grebes, sacred ibis and stilts.

He is best known as the producer of the kawaii metal group Babymetal.  Biography  Kobayashi's interest in heavy metal music started around his sixth grade in elementary school after listening to the band Seikima-II. He joined Amuse in 1996 and spent the early years of his career doing media promotion for visual kei bands such as Siam Shade and Cascade. On March 14, 2009, he accompanied Mini-Pati, a patissier-themed girl group formed by Amuse in cooperation with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in their appearance at the farewell concert of Karen Girl's, of which Suzuka Nakamoto was a member. After watching Nakamoto's performance, Kobayashi planned to launch a new musical unit combining J-pop and heavy metal with her as the lead singer. Future Babymetal member Yui Mizuno was also present at the concert. In 2010, the idol group Sakura Gakuin was formed by Amuse with a theme of school life and club activities.

He has been with the Department of Mechanical Engineering until 2018 when he retired as a Professor Emeritus. During 1987-1991 Ben-Dor served as the Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering; he served as the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences during 1994-2000 and 2008-2011; during 2000-2006 he served as the Director of the Institutes for Applied Research of the Ben-Gurion University. In addition, since 1997 Ben-Dor served as the Head of the Protective Technologies R&D; Center until his retirement in 2018. = Fraud suspicion = During 2005, Prof. Ben-Dor has been under fraud suspicion by the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) of the Ben- Gurion University of the Negev. The claims of CIA were based on the receipts of Ben-Dor's private company that he used by himself to get a refund from his research account (e.g. public money) being financed by the Israeli government. Despite a detailed report submitted by the CIA to the university management, the university's rector decided only to reprimand Ben-Dor. That decision and the detailed report was leaked to the media, and the most famous investigative journalist in Israel those days: Mordechay Gilat, published the story in the most popular Israeli newspaper, while attacking and blaming Ben-Dor of fraud, and the rector of unjustified cover upMordechay Gilat, 2005. \\"The Professor got a punishment‚Äù (free translation from Hebrew), Yediot Achronot, June 17th 2005, the main appendix, p. 21 (in Hebrew). . 7 years later, following a legal opinion by the university attorneyA Legal opinion Concerning Prof. Gabi Ben- Dor. Chen Yaary Advocates, Amot Investments Tower, Tel-Aviv 64239, August 02nd 2012, 12 pages (in Hebrew), Ben-Dor was suspected once again by the university CIA of receiving funds fraudulently from the universitySuspicious of Fraud under conflict of interests. BGU CIA Inspection No. 120 dated June 13th 2012, 21 pages with appendixes.. In aim to clear the accusations, Ben-Dor agreed to refund the university (half a million NIS - as $140,000)Prof. Gabi Ben-Dor to the President of the university, to the Rector & to the CEO, dated March 6th 2012., and so he did. The university submitted a complaint to the police, but the case was dismissed with no criminal charges. Ben-Dor did not receive his refund back, as the university started a disciplinary procedure by its internal committee, replacing the criminal process. At last, a plea has been reached between the university and Ben-Dor stating that he will retire immediately (6 months before his official retirement) and will donate from his research accounts a sum of 60,000 NIS for students advanced research, in addition to the money he paid already to the university.

Buchenwald was a labor camp, and as a result a child's chances of survival depended greatly on their age. The older they were, the better, because that meant that they were fit to do work. Oftentimes, children lied about their ages to make them older, so that rather than being sent to Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen to be killed, they could work in the camp. Children were at high risk for being killed at Buchenwald, because if they were too weak or young, this meant that they were unfit for labor, and therefore had no use. The creation of the children's barrack, Block 66, served to protect these children from the Nazi agenda. History Block 66 was created in 1945, during the last year of the war. The need for this block was related to the rapidly increasing number of children in Buchenwald. In April 1943, there were only 142 inmates under the age of twenty. At this time, the children were kept hidden in Block 8, located in the main camp. By the time December 1944 rolled around however, there were over 23,000 inmates under the age of 20, which was 37% percent of the population. The age group of specifically 14-18 year olds, was around eighty-five percent of the total number of children in the camp. The youngest reported inmate was a Polish three years-old. During the last year of the war, the Nazis began sending large numbers of Jewish Eastern European children to Buchenwald as a result of their failing war efforts. The Nazis were forced to evacuate other camps due to the Allied Powers closing in on the German fronts. Establishment of the block The establishment of the children's block was led by Antonin Kalina, a Czech communist prisoner. Kalina, with the help of other political prisoners, was able to persuade the SS at Buchenwald to let them create a block for the new influx of adolescents coming in from the East. The block used for the children was conveniently located in the corner of the little camp, ensuring that it was as far away from the Nazi's watch as possible. Every block had what was called a ‚Äúblock elder‚Äù who was responsible for ensuring that the inmates of their block went to roll-call, followed orders, did their work, and kept up with their daily tasks. The block elder of Block 66 was Kalina, and he is primarily responsible for saving the lives of the 900 boys living in Block 66. Life in the barrack While conditions were not great anywhere in the camp, for the children of Block 66, they were slightly better. Unlike adults, most children could not fend off the disease, hunger, and physical and psychological trauma as well. Adults, specifically the communist prisoners directly tried to help the children. The other prisoners in Buchenwald did all that they could in their power to try and protect the children from the SS, and as the war was clearly ending, from being taken out on death marches. Men would also give extra food to these starving boys and share packages from The Red Cross with them. Had there not been Block 66, most of these children would have perished in the camp. The children were not made to work in the camp, as most were too weak and young to do any actual labor. During the days, when it was possible, the children were taught songs in Yiddish and told stories by some elders and older children to keep them occupied and filled with hope for the outside world. Additionally, Kalina, to help protect the children in the barrack, made them change clothes, so as not to be dressed as Jews, and changed the Jewish sounding names of the boys, so that when the SS officers came by looking for Jews, he could tell them that there were none in his block. Liberation On April 11, 1945, at approximately 3:15 pm, Buchenwald was finally liberated by the U.S. Army; 21,000 inmates were liberated that day of which 904 were children. After liberation, most of these boys, after receiving medical attention and aid, having lost their families, were sent to orphanages. After the war Years later, Antonin Kalina was accepted as ‚Äúrighteous among the nations‚Äù at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel, in 2012, for his efforts and for successfully saving the lives of 904 youths.

It was founded at the initiative of Erkki Tuomioja, the former foreign minister of Finland. The purpose of the organization is to further public discussion about history and to promote the use of historical knowledge for peace-building and conflict- resolution. The organisation has an international network of Historians without Borders and coordinating committee, with which the organisation aims to promote their goals.  History  In June 2015, Erkki tuomioja convened a number of historians and policy makers to a meeting, which led to the founding of HWB. First board was appointed, which included names like Finnish politician and historian Pilvi Torsti, former editor-in-chief of Helsingin Sanomat Janne Virkkunen and executive director of CMI Tuija Talvitie. Erkki Tuomioja has acted as Chairman of the Board since the founding meeting. Behind the initiative was Tuomioja's concern, that history is often used and abused for personal or political purposes. Inadequate knowledge of history makes people more vulnerable to manipulation of politicians, who can use historical myths and propaganda to their advantage easier. HWB aims to prevent the abuse of history by bringing historians and their knowledge to society and conflict- resolution. HWB has aimed from the beginning to the wider international co- operation between historians across the borders. With this in mind, HWB organised in May 2016 and international conference \\"Historians without Borders: The Use and Abuse of History in Conflicts\\" at the University of Helsinki. Around 300 participants gathered in Helsinki and the conference ended with the creation of an international network of Historians without Borders and the appointment of a Coordinating Committee. Members of this committee are Jan C. Behrends, Carl Bildt, Vasu Gounden, Margaret MacMillan, Erkki Tuomioja, Christina Twomey and Sergei Zhuravlev.  Aims  * promote and deepen general and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of history * promote open and free access to historical material and archives * promote interactive dialogue between different views and interpretations of history to bring closer diverging views of the course of historical events * support efforts to impede the abuse of history to foster conflicts or to sustain enemy images and distorted myths, and to contribute to the use of history in defusing and resolving conflicts.

The sites associated with it are located in Gujarat, India. Nomenclature During the earlier excavations at Surkotada, the ceramics of this culture were described as the coarse red or gray \\"local\\" ware. P. Ajitprasad and V. H. Sonawane described these non-Harappan ceramics from north Gujarat as the \\"Anarta ware\\". Anarta is a historical name of north Gujarat. The name later applied retrospectively to this type of ceramics found from other sites. Publicly accessible Penn Dissertations. Paper 359.  Geographical range  The core area of Anarta tradition is located in north Gujarat having 67 sites while four sites are reported from Kutch and three sites from Saurashtra regions. The Padri Ware is not very different from the Anarta tradition. So if it is considered as the Anarta tradition, its ten sites in Saurashtra can be added to the Anarta tradition. Sites and association with Harappans The ceramics similar to the Anarta tradition was first reported from Surkotada with Classical Harappan (IA, IB and IC periods) ceramics. When Nagwada in Surendranagar district was excavated, this distinctive regional type of ceramics were first recognized where it was associated with Pre-Urban and Urban Harappan artifacts. The Anarta tradition was recognized as an independent culture when Loteshwar in Patan district was excavated in 1991-92. These ceramics are also associated with Pre-Urban Harappan Sindh Type Pottery/Burial pottery (Amri Nal type) found at Motipipli and Datrana and with Pre-Prabhas pottery at Datrana. These ceramics are also compared and found similar to the Padri Ware. These ceramics are also found in the association of the Classical Harappan and Sorath Harappan elements at Gola Dhoro (Bagasara) in Saurashtra and Shikarpur in Kutch. These ceramics are also found Rangpur IIC period. They are not found associated with Post-Urban Harrapan artefacts at any sites. Other sites are Panchasar, Santhli, Lothal, Zekhada, Rojdi and possibly Desalpur. These sites are concentrated in Patan, Mehsana and Banaskantha districts in north Gujarat. These sites in north Gujarat are located in sand dunes which may have provided fresh water from its interdunal depressions and pastures for animals. These people may have originated from the early Mesolithic people settled here. The lived alongside other \\"aboriginal\\" hunter-gatherer people. Ceramics The Anarta ceramics include gritty red ware, fine red ware, burnished red ware and burnished grey/black wares. The pottery from this tradition are hand or slow wheel made and are coarse and well-fired. The vessel forms include straight or convex sided bowls with incurved rims; basins with thick flaring rim; pots or jars with flaring rim, narrow neck and bulging body. These vessels are treated with red slip with paintings in red, black and white.

Her father's death brought many problems and difficulties for her and her mother. Her aunts began to mistreat them. After watching this her maternal grandfather took his daughter (Basant's mother) back to his home and decided to marry her off again. Basant's grandfather made a condition to them that Basant will live at her paternal home and not with her mother. Panchayat agreed with them and gave permission to marry Basant's mother again and separated her from Basant. Also, for their relation allowed her to visit her mother once in 6 months. Her mother was married in the village Khiwa. After six months, Basant's aunt taught her to say that she doesn't want to meet her mother. Therefore, she couldn't meet her mother and was separated from her forever. After some time, her grandfather thought he should marry her off as well as he could die anytime and can't trust his family members to take care of her after him. And coincidentally, she is married to Mehtaab Singh in a village where her inlaws will be neighbours to her mother. It instilled a hope in her that she will meet her mother again and she was happy to get married there. And when she would grow up they would send her there. After many years, there were two Mehtaab Singh's in army also the names of their villages were also same. One of them was whom to Basant Kaur was married dies during war with China.

He gets mistaken for Basant's husband Mehtaab and cousin brother requests him to pretend so that his Basant can finally have some happiness in her life. While, on other hand, Basant's aunt asks Mehtaab to marry Basant and he unwillingly agrees. But when marriage was supposed to happen Bheem Singh saw it and tells the truth to other family members. All this leads to chaos and Basant's uncles trying to kill Mehtaab but however Basant's cousin Bahadur Singh convinces everyone on behalf of Basant's life and what has happened to her in whole life and he succeeds. Basant is married to Mehtaab Singh. In next scene, Mehtaab and Basant come to Kheewa, Mehtaab's village and when the door opens it is the Basant's mother who is performing the rituals, Basant identifies her and both reconcile after a long time. Later, Basant lives with her mother for the rest of her life, she has a daughter named Seerat who is in Canada and Mehtaab also died a year earlier who inspired her to write an auto- biography.

He is known as the Rio Bravo Assassin, alluding to his motive. He was captured and sentenced to prison time for three murders in 1986, but he escaped in 1990 and after remaining a fugitive from justice, he was recaptured in New Mexico and deported from the US back to Ciudad Ju√°rez. On January 24, 2014 he was delivered halfway through the Reforma International Bridge, from Lerdo Avenue by ICE agents to agens from the Mexican Ministerial Police. Currently, he is one of the main suspects in the unsolved femincides in Ciudad Ju√°rez. He was a disorganized, sedentary, hedonistic murderer motivated by sexual compulsion and predatory behaviour.  Background  Padilla lived in the Mariscal district of downtown Ju√°rez as a regular drug addict.  Crimes  In 1986, the bodies of young women began to appear on the banks of the Rio Grande, representing one of the first feminicides reported in Ciudad Ju√°rez. The women, some of them underage, showed signs of sexual abuse and were killed by strangulation. Pedro Padilla used to follow his victims to deserted places where he subdued and raped them, choking them with his bare hands, supposedly this was done to make the vagina contract during the violation. Quite possibly, Flores committed the crimes under the influence of drugs. According to Joel Norris, drug use is frequent during the first behavioural phase of a serial killer, in which they distance themselves from reality.  Apprehension, condemnation and escape  Padilla was captured in 1986, by the Second Commander of the Judicial Police of the state of Chihuahua, Felipe Pando. Pedro Padilla Flores confessed to 30 murders but only 3 could be proven: two of women and one of a 13-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was held for only 4 years in the Social Rehabilitation Center of Ciudad Ju√°rez, and since his escape from prison in 1990 in what represents one of largest cases of police negligence and incompetence in Mexico, but was arrested in the US by ICE agents and handed over to the Mexican authorities on January 24, 2014 to be tried for the pending crimes.  New crimes  In 1992, the murders of women in Ju√°rez began again. For Felipe Pando, Flores remains the main suspect:Although Pando has one of the worst reputations within the border police, with several complaints of torture and forced confessions, it is undeniable that many of the recent crimes against women in Ju√°rez correspond to the pattern and modus operandi of Padilla Flores. = The murder of Hester S. van Nierop = On September 20, 1998, the body of Dutch citizen Hester Suzanne van Nierop was found under the bed of a hotel room in the red zone of Ciudad Ju√°rez; she had been raped and strangled, had multiple mutilations that correspond to defeminization pattern and also had incisions on her neck. Hester had arrived at the hotel on September 19, 1998 in the company of a man. The person who had rented the room had signed in as \\"Roberto Flores\\". = Portrayal = Van Nierop's partner was described to the police as: The description matched to that of Pedro Padilla Flores' and the murderer had signed in with his second name, but the modus operandi did not match, as this time it was an organized killer, apparently evolving. Hester was not the first and not last to die this way, and Flores became the main suspect in her death and the deaths of others. = Investigation and detention = The Attorney General of the State of Chihuahua implemented a series of intelligence and covert operations, after resuming the matter, since 2004 an arrest was issued. The probable culprit was a moderately-known person in central Ju√°rez, a subject that attracted attention with his special characteristics: deformed handset, athletic build and striking tattoos that showed a naked woman. Ramiro Adame L√≥pez/Roberto Flores was placed in a USA jail; however, an extensive search was made, as he used up to seven different aliases. Agents of the Cyber Police and the Intelligence Agency made contact with the murderer on Facebook, where an agent passed himself off as a woman, kept constant communication and in a span of seven months managed to gain his trust, which was reflected when he confessed to the committing the murder of the Dutch citizen. In December 2013, investigating agents of the Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Attorney General of Chihuahua obtained specific data on Ramiro Adame L√≥pez's location - he was in Adams County, Mississippi in a Federal Bureau of Prisoners, where he was detained for drug trafficking. In cooperation with the FBI and ICE, the detention of L√≥pez in one of the latter's prisons was confirmed, for which international legal assistance began to move him back to Ciudad Ju√°rez and judge him for the crime. On January 15, 2014, L√≥pez was deported to Ju√°rez, where he was served with the arrest warrant for the murder of van Nierop, and placed at the disposal of the judge who required it. = Sentence = Once in national territory, the judge who displaced the arrest warrant claimed it and a process against L√≥pez was initiated, which ended on December 1, 2015, when the General Prosecutor presented a solid and reliable investigation, integrated by technical tests, scientific studies, analysis, documentaries, expert opinions that ultimately convicted Ramiro Adame L√≥pez for the homicide of Hester van Nierop. The Public Ministry had a total of seven testimonies who saw him together at the crime scene with the victim. A receptionist who was present said: \\"I wrote down his name with my own hand and have the record book from the time\\", but in addition expert tests which included footprints were presented. Finally, after a 17-year struggle, justice was done to the victim's family, which is recounted by Mrs. Ars√©ne van Nierop's book \\"A cry for help from Ju√°rez\\", which also details the creation of the Hester Foundation in 2005, in which the work of the Casa Amiga crisis center is supported by offering psychic, legal, educational and social help to Mexican women and informing about the prevention of violence. = A matter of international relevance = The issue generated a strong reaction from the Dutch government that made an international diplomatic claim. The matter was practically without movement, the alleged perpetrator was not captured and during all that time there was strong pressure due to the intervention of the United States Organization and the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights. On the day of the sentencing, Attorney General of Chihuahua, Jorge Enrique Gonz√°lez Nicol√°s, contacted the Dutch ambassador in Mexico, who, during the entire process, was on the watch and in touch with the agency. He also linked with the victim's mother and the federal authorities to inform them of the conclusion of the criminal process. Once the murderer was arrested, diplomatic authorities from the Netherlands made a comment of gratitude to the Mexican State, as this was a matter of international importance and interest. With the condemnatory sentence of 35 years in prison and reparation of damage, it is fully complied with the petition before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights to do justice for van Nierop.

It is a mostly residential area known for its high concentration of Victorian and early 20th-century houses and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Huning Highlands Historic District. There is also a commercial district along the main thoroughfares, Central Avenue (former U.S. Route 66) and Broadway Boulevard. Huning Highlands was developed starting in 1880 and is named for Franz Huning, a prominent businessman at the time. Geography The generally accepted boundaries of the neighborhood are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue to the north, Locust Street to the east, Coal Avenue to the south, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks to the west. The historic district boundaries extend an additional block south to Iron Avenue. with Adjacent neighborhoods include Downtown to the west, Martineztown-Santa Barbara to the north, Sycamore to the east, and South Broadway to the south. The terrain consists of rising sand hills which increase in elevation from west to east. Demographics The 2010 United States Census recorded a population in Huning Highlands of approximately 1,047 residents. The racial breakdown of the neighborhood was 51% non-Hispanic white, 37% Hispanic, 4% American Indian, 3% Asian, 2% Black, and 3% other races or mixed-race. History The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached Albuquerque in 1880, fueling land speculation as investors hoped to profit from its arrival. The New Mexico Town Company, formed by local businessmen Franz Huning, Elias S. Stover, and William Hazeldine, succeeded in attracting the railroad facilities to their chosen site about from the existing community at Old Town. The parcel they assembled quickly developed into the booming community of New Town‚Äîtoday's Downtown. Huning also owned land in the rolling sandhills further to the east, which was known as the Highlands due to its elevation. In 1880, the land was platted as the first subdivision to be added to the original townsite. This new neighborhood was named Huning's Highland Addition, which later shifted to Huning Highlands. The neighborhood was laid out by civil engineer Walter G. Marmon, who named the main north-south streets Arno, after Franz Huning's son, Walter and Edith after his own son and daughter, and Broadway, because \\"every town should have a Broadway\\". The uppermost street of the gently sloping neighborhood was named High Street. The Highlands quickly became one of Albuquerque's most popular residential areas and was home to many of the city's prominent early residents. Unlike the old Hispanic neighborhoods like Old Town, Barelas, and Atrisco, Huning Highlands was primarily built by recently arrived Anglo-Americans and European immigrants. As such, the houses in the neighborhood reflected styles and materials popular in the eastern and Midwestern United States‚ÄîQueen Anne, Italianate, and other Victorian styles‚Äîrather than traditional regional forms. Most of the houses were built using prefabricated trim and architectural elements in a mix-and- match approach not adhering to any particular style, though some are more cohesive. The neighborhood continued to fill in between the 1880s and 1920s, by which time it was almost completely built up. Residents enjoyed amenities like Highland Park, one of the city's oldest public parks, the Old Main Library, and an electric streetcar line which went into service in 1911. However, as the city continued to grow, many wealthy residents abandoned the older inner-city neighborhoods in favor of the more suburban developments further to the east. By the 1970s, Huning Highlands had become a relatively poor neighborhood consisting largely of absentee-owned rental housing. The Huning Highlands Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and in 1980, the Albuquerque City Council approved the city's first Historic Overlay Zone for the neighborhood. The city designation requires approval from the Landmarks and Urban Conservation Commission for any alterations to contributing properties in the district and provides tax incentives for home restoration projects. These actions had a positive effect on the neighborhood and led to many of the historic houses being restored. According to the Huning Highlands Historic District Association, the percentage of properties that were considered \\"blighted or substandard\\" decreased from 52% in 1976 to 17% in 1986 and was estimated at less than 5% by 2005. Development in the neighborhood's commercial district has also increased since the early 2000s, with large projects including the Albuquerque High Lofts and Innovate ABQ, a mixed-use tech campus. Education Huning Highlands is served by Albuquerque Public Schools. Public school students from the neighborhood attend Longfellow or Eugene Field Elementary School, Jefferson Middle School, and Albuquerque High School. Transportation The main east-west streets in Huning Highlands are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Central Avenue, and Lead and Coal Avenues, a pair of one-way arterials. The major north-south street is Broadway Boulevard. The neighborhood also has access to Interstate 25 immediately to the east. Huning Highlands is served by the Albuquerque Rapid Transit Red and Green rapid bus lines via the EDo station. Local (non-express) bus service also operates on the following routes: 12 Constitution Commuter, 50 Airport-Downtown, and 92 Taylor Ranch Express on Martin Luther King; 66 Central on Central; 97 Zuni and 217 Downtown-KAFB Limited on Lead/Coal; and 16 Broadway-University-Gibson on Broadway. The major transit hub at Alvarado Transportation Center is just outside the neighborhood to the west.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History The Detroit and Bay City Railroad first reached Rochester in 1872, and a local merchant immediately erected an elevator. In 1880, brothers Charles Kelley and Albert G. Griggs broke ground on this competing elevator. It was such a success that the brothers build a second elevator in 1884. In 1900, the Griggs sold the elevator to Erastus S. Letts, who sold it a few years later to Ferrin Brothers and Company, a large firm based in Rochester, New York. IN 1909, a group of local investors, including both Charles K. Griggs and Erastus S. Letts, formed the Rochester Elevator Company and repurchased the elevator from Ferrin Brothers. The company immediately began expanding and improving the elevator, likely by moving previously existing buildings into place and joining them to the 1880 elevator. The Rochester Elevator changed ownership again in 1913, 1922, and 1930. In 1932, local businessman Lewis Cass Crissman purchased it, turning over operation to his son, L. Keith Crissman, who purchased it himself in 1942. It was sold again in 1952, 1956, and 1962, and Lawrence Smith eventually took over operation of the elevator. However, by the 1960s, the need for an elevator in Rochester was rapidly waning, and shipping became a minor portion of the business. Smith transitioned the company to a retail feed and seed and home and garden supply outlet, and continued operating it well into the 21st century. Description The Rochester Grain Elevator is a two- and three-story wood frame grain elevator, made up of three separate buildings joined together to make one structure. The three portions are of roughly equal length, and are joined together end-to-end. The central building is the original 1880 Griggs Brothers elevator. It is a two-story timber frame structure on a fieldstone foundation, covered in board and batten wood siding, with a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles. The southern section is a two-story plank frame building moved to the site in 1909. It is sheathed in rough sawn vertical wood siding and has a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, and sits on a concrete block foundation. The northern section is a three-story timber frame building sheathed with wood siding on two sides and sawn vertical wood siding on the other two. It has a gambrel roof covered in asphalt shingles and sits on a poured concrete foundation. This section is likely constructed from nearby building that was salvaged in 1909 and joined to the original elevator. The entire structure is painted barn red. The facade facing the street has two public entrances covered by a corrugated metal awning, which runs the length of the building. A small shed- roofed addition is on one end. The facade at the end facing University drive has advertising signage painted directly on the siding.

They frequently utilize pre-existing cavities, but also excavate their own nests. A Stigmus americanus wasp provisions its nest with paralyzed aphids, and places its eggs on the thoracic ventor and abdomen of the aphids in its nest. When an egg hatches, the larva feeds on the paralyzed aphid and eventually emerges from the aphid shell as an adult wasp. The cuckoo wasps Omalus iridescens and O. purpuratus parasitize Stigmus americanus (along some other aphid wasps) by laying eggs in live aphids at a hunting site of Stigmus americanus, which then paralyzes the aphids and moves them to its nest along with the embedded eggs.

Life and career Gale was born in Salford. He played football for South Salford Lads' Club and Sedgley Park, from where he signed for First Division club Bury. He made his debut in 1926, but played infrequently for the first team39 appearances spread over five seasons of which two-thirds were in 1928‚Äì29and spent the 1930‚Äì31 season at Chester. In that season Gale scored more than 100 goals, of which no fewer than 73 goals came in Cheshire League matches. Chester were elected to the Football League for the 1931‚Äì32 season, and were willing to pay Bury the ¬£400 fee, but he was sold instead to First Division club West Bromwich Albion, who as part of the deal allowed their player Frank Cresswell to rejoin Chester. He remained a fringe player at West Bromwich Albion, and the club encouraged him to continue in his chosen profession, as a schoolteacher in the Manchester area. He did however play a major role in their progress to the 1935 FA Cup Final. He came into the team in place of the injured Tommy Glidden, and scored in each round from third to sixth, but was dropped in favour of Glidden for the final, which Albion lost to Sheffield Wednesday. After five-and-a-half seasons during which he made 23 league appearances and scored 18 league goals, he returned to Chester. Less prolific and less of a regular in the side than before, Gale still produced 16 goals from 35 matches in the Third Division North11 from 16 in the 1937‚Äì38 seasonbefore moving back to the Cheshire League with Macclesfield in October 1938. He finished as their top scorer for 1938‚Äì39, and earned himself a return to the Football League with Accrington Stanley, but appeared just once before competitive football was abandoned for the duration of the war. He played and scored in the wartime competitions for Altrincham, and went on to act as the club's reserve team manager, first-team coach, assistant first-team manager and scout. Gale became head of Lower Kersal Council School in Salford, where one of his pupils was the mountaineer Don Whillans. He died in 1976 in Trafford at the age of 71.

She is most known for her role in the assassination of Wilhelm Kube, for which she and her fellow co-conspirators were honored with the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 October 1943.  Early life  Troyan was born on 24 October 1921 to a working-class Belarussian family in the village of Drissa, located within the Vitebsk province of present-day Belarus. Her family frequently moved to different parts of the Soviet Union including Chechnya and Siberia. After completing ten grades of school with excellent marks she entered training at the Moscow Medical Institute, but transferred to the Minsk Medical Institute when her family moved to Minsk.  World War II  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 the German army quickly took control of Troyan's hometown and she was forced to clean the Wehrmacht's barracks. She was later reassigned to kitchen duty and worked with several prisoners of war. She found an anti-occupation pamphlet in her backyard and spread out several copies, but after her family moved to Smalyavichy she became more involved in the resistance movement after learning that a fellow nurse at the hospital where she worked, Nyura Kosarevskaya, was helping a group of partisans. Eventually, Troyan gained Kosarevskaya's trust and Troyan assisted the partisan unit by working as a translator since she knew quite a bit of German. She began producing leaflets written in German directed at Wehrmacht soldiers, then hid them in the bottom of containers of food sold to German troops, and she would smuggle weapons and supplies to the Minsk resistance whenever a German officer took her to Minsk. Later the Germans became more suspicious of her in the summer of 1942, so they forced her to watch a mass execution of alleged partisans. After that she managed to lead Smalyavichy and began working as a nurse in the \\"Dyadi Koli\\" partisan unit. She was then assigned to the 5th sub- detachment, which was supposed to derail trains, destroy German equipment, and help Soviet prisoners escape. In Spring 1943 Troyan was assigned the dangerous task of finding someone to assassinate Wilhelm Kube, a high-ranking member of the SS and the General-Kommissar of Nazi-occupied Belarus. Troyan eventually settled on a young woman by the name of Yelena Mazanik, who worked in Kube's mansion as a maid and was the sister of another partisan, Valentina Shchutskoi. Mazanik was very afraid to trust Troyan at first but after Mazanik's sister verified the identity of the co-conspirator who would provide the bomb, Mariya Osipova, Mazanik was more at ease and agreed to the plan. Mazanik planted the bomb the assassination went as planned; afterward all three members of the plot including Troyan were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 October 1943. She continued participating in resistance activities until the end of the war.  Later life  After the end of the war Troyan graduated in 1947 from medical school in Moscow and went on to become a surgeon. She became a Candidate of Medical Sciences in 1962 after writing her dissertation, after which she worked for the Ministry of Health at the Central Scientific Research Institute for Health Education of the USSR, and eventually became the program's director. Her son Aleksei became a cardiovascular surgeon. She died in Moscow on 7 September 2011 at the age of 89.

Such scientists are seen to exceed the ordinary university professors in research qualification and are elected on a competitive basis.For example, in March 2018, there were over 800 applicants for 114 professorships in the Russian Academy of Sciences. The academy professors have an employment relationship with the organizations where their research posts are located. Such academy professors exist in Finland, Russia and Kasachstan. Some academies, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, may also award the honorary academy professor titles.  Finland  In Finland, the academy professors () are assigned by the Academy of Finland (). Presently there are 25 scientists in this status. Among these, there are, for example, an ecologist Johanna Mappes and a specialist in computational nanoscience Hannu H√§kkinen. The service duration is five years. In order to be considered for an Academy Professorship, applicants must have demonstrated their skills and competencies in research and be regarded as contributing to the progress of research within their own field. Research posts as Academy Professor presumes a full-time research work where the professors carry out their own research plan, supervise their research team and provide guidance to junior researchers. Their duties also include supervision of thesis and dissertation writers in their own field and teaching related to their research.

The election is based on scientific achievements. The titles are either \\"RAS Professor\\" (), with 605 holders in 2018, or \\"RAE Professor\\" (), respectively. Along with a current work at their institutions, these professors are expected to take part in the strategic planning of scientific politics in Russia at different levels; they are also treated as possible candidates for membership in the Academy in the future. The professor titles are also introduced in several non-state academies, like, e.g. the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (s. sample certificate), but reputation of such academies is doubtful and their titles are not considered seriously.

between Iceland and Greenland, while on its way to Halifax, Canada. It was the first crash of the Antonov 22 model and it resulted in the deaths of all 22 people on board. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-22 heavy-lift freighter built in the Tashkent Mechanical Plant between late 1969 and early 1970 with the construction number 00340207 and serial number 02-07. The aircraft was built for the Soviet Air Forces, where it was assigned the registration CCCP-09303, and was stationed at Ivanovo Severny Air Base near Ivanovo. Background and flight Following the 1970 Ancash earthquake, which killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed many cities in Peru, the 81st Military Transport Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces participated in the transport of humanitarian aid to that country. The unit operated heavy-lift aircraft, among them the Antonov An-22. Due to the limited range and heavy cargo of food and seven passengers, the flight plan called for the aircraft to make several stops while on its way to Peru. Since the flight was longer than , two crews were used for the flight. This also served as a training opportunity for the pilots. Crash On 18 July the aircraft took off from Keflafik airport in Iceland on its way to Halifax. Forty-seven minutes after the aircraft took off, at 14:30 all contact with it was lost and it disappeared from radar screens. As the crew did not respond to communication from the air traffic controllers and no airport recorded the aircraft landing, it was presumed that the aircraft had crashed in the ocean. Soon after a search and rescue operation began together with NATO aircraft and a Soviet Antonov An-12. During the search pieces of the aircraft were found, confirming that it had indeed crashed. No survivors were found. Investigation Following the inspection of recovered pieces of the aircraft, an in-flight fire was ruled out. The Soviet Ministry of Aviation Production made a hypothesis that an uncontrolled decompression had occurred, the cause of which has never been fully established. Five months after the crash of CCCP-09303, a sister aircraft crashed in India, killing all 17 on board. The cause of that crash was the separation of one of the propeller blades, which struck the fuselage of the aircraft and caused an explosive decompression. It is believed that this was most likely also the cause of the crash of CCCP-09303 in the Atlantic. Aftermath Following the disaster, all pressurized An-22s were grounded. Memorials to the flight crew of CCCP-09303 were built in Moscow and Lima.

It was produced by Jeffrey S. Magnussen, Ian Truitner and Richard Halpern, and written by Mike Le and Ian Truitner.  Plot  The Iraq War remains one of the most controversial U.S. overseas engagements of past 30 years. The instability it wrought on the region gave rise to ISIS and a host of other problems to Iraq and surrounding countries. And yet the primary rationales for going to war WMDs and Saddam Hussein's links to Al Qaeda, have been proven false. Streets across America now have an endemic problem of veterans with PTSD, leading to violence, suicide and homelessness. In an alternate 2007 reality, a group of disgruntled soldiers stationed in Iraq kidnap the visiting U.S. President, and interrogate him using the same techniques they were trained to inflict on Hussein's old cohorts and other terror 'suspects'. Their purpose is to extract from the president the real reasons for the Iraq invasion, as they know by now the stated reasons were bogus. The soldiers have a very limited amount of time to complete this fateful mission though, as the full force of the United States military is deployed to extract the President from captivity no matter what the cost.

Explanations for this relationship have come from both medical and evolutionary approaches, with disagreements stemming primarily about whether the connection is functional and why depression and inflammation share similar physiological pathways.  Depression and inflammation  Major depression is often associated with biomarkers indicative of inflammatory responses, with interleukin-6, interleukin-1, interleukin-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 all being found to be elevated in those with depression. Similarly, the same biomarkers are also strongly associated with sickness behavior, with both humans and non-human animals displaying decreased motor activity and lowered interest in normal activities in experimental and naturalistic studies. Despite these symptoms overlapping with major depression, they are insufficient to result in a diagnosis on their own, with their connection to inflammation being better understood than their connection to depression. The relationship between inflammation and depression is also seen across the lifespan, with inflammation at one point being associated with increased risk of depression later in life. This has been seen in relatively short periods with both adult men and women with high levels of inflammatory markers experiencing increased risk of depression in the following years. Similar affects are also seen over longer periods of time, with multiple longitudinal studies finding high levels of inflammation early in life to be associated with increased risk of depression as an adult. Although less studied, evidence also exists for this relationship also being found in the opposite direction, with early experiences of major depression being associated with stronger inflammatory responses to social stressors later in life. Despite these associations between inflammation and depression symptoms, the degree to which this relationship is casual it is still largely unclear. Of the reasons for this, one is that most of the studies examining inflammation are limited to peripheral markers of inflammation, with direct examinations of their connection to processes in the brain being rare. Another is the fact that both depression and inflammation are often confounded with other conditions, allowing for the possibility they both may be caused by other variables rather than one directly causing the other. Of these potential variables, obesity has received the most attention due to findings that BMI often moderates or mediates the link between depression symptoms and inflammation. = Comorbidity = Although not as strong as a risk factor as social adversity, illness is often associated with depression. Compared to the healthy portion of the US population, those experiencing illness are 5-10 times more likely to experience depression or depression-like symptoms. This association appears to often develop rapidly and is not constrained to individual with the condition, with a large-scale twin study finding that individuals with severe illness or injury had an odds ratio of 3.1 for developing major depression in the first month of their condition and those with an important member in their social network becoming severely ill having an odds ratio of 2.5 over the same time period. However, the increased association between inflammatory responses and depression is not constrained to times around illness, with both infections and autoimmune disorders increasing one's risk of depression later in life. In addition to its association with illness in general, depression appears to be particularly connected to conditions in which inflammation makes up a substantial part of symptomology. For example, asthma, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis are all often co-morbid with depression and characterized by seemingly excessive inflammatory responses. Although much of these symptoms overlap both sickness behavior and depression, symptoms associated with solely with depression are also often found, with suicidal ideation and increased anxiety being common in individuals with autoimmune disorders. = Anti- inflammatories = Although in the early stages of research, there are indications that anti-inflammatories can reduce symptoms in those with depression and mood disorders. While depression symptoms tend to be sensitive to placebo responses, clinical trials have shown that these benefits often outperform placebos when used on their own or in conjunction with anti- depressants, with NSAIDs and cytokine inhibitors each being shown effective by multiple trials. In addition, statins, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatories aimed at specific illnesses all have been shown to has positive effects on depression but in a lesser number of studies. However, despite initial evidence for the ability of anti- inflammatories to lessen depression symptoms, the diverse nature of methods used in these studies and the risks of side effects have been suggested to warrant caution when considering their potential as depression treatments. The use of NSAIDs in particular, has been cautioned due to concerns over potential side-effects and their potential the limit the effectiveness of certain antidepressants. = Antidepressants = Similar to findings that anti- inflammatories may reduce depression symptoms, antidepressants have been shown to reduce inflammation levels. In particular, both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are often reported to come with both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in clinical trials. In addition to this, a smaller number of studies have reported that those who did not respond to antidepressants had higher levels of inflammatory markers than those who the treatments worked for.  Risk factors  Beyond often being associated between with one another, both depression and inflammation are similarly sensitive to external stressors, something which has been used to further argue in favor of their connection. Of the possible types of stressors, those involving social adversity tend to be the most likely to result in depression and are significant predictors of inflammation levels in both experimental and observational studies. This is often seen short term, with inflammation markers often being found to be elevated in response to negative social outcomes and throughout the course of one's depression, with bereaved individuals often experiencing greater inflammation than non-greaving individuals. Both one's risk of depression and inflammation levels have also been found to be higher in adults who experienced childhood adversity. Similarly, these individuals also face increased risk of autoimmune diseases, which are both indicative of greater inflammatory responses and risk factors for depression. As with the relationship between depression and inflammation as a whole, this relationship is thought to be bidirectional with both depression increasing one's risk of autoimmune disease and autoimmune disease increasing one's risk of depression. However, it is also likely that this connection is also due in part to depression and inflammation sharing many risk factors that may contribute to both conditions. = Social support as a protective factor = Similar to their shared risk factors, social support has been found to reduce the risk of both depression and pro-inflammatory phenotypes. This is seen with relatively high levels of social support being found to be associated with decreased risk of depression as well as asthma and heart disease, while also being associated with decreased levels of inflammatory markers as a whole following negative social interactions.  Physiological pathways  = Inflammasomes = Of the pathways linking the non-pathogenic stressors associated with depression to inflammation, inflammasome activation has been highlighted as one of the most promising. While major depression is associated with increased inflammasome activation in general, the NLRP3 inflammasome complex has received the most attention in relation to major depression due to both its role in triggering the release of interleukin-1Œ≤ and interleukin-18 and its association with depression and depression-like symptoms in both humans and non-human animals. Compared to other inflammasomes, NLPR3 is sensitive to a greater number and variety of stressors and has been shown to result in inflammation without the presence of pathogens. This is possible due to NLPR3's sensitivity to a wide range of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which can indicate the presence of various forms noninfectious stressors throughout the body. Due to this sensitivity and NLPR3's role in triggering cytokine release, NLPR3 is thought to be a key component in sterile inflammatory responses, something which has led to the suggestion that it is a likely mechanism linking non-pathogen induced stress to the increased inflammation that is common in depression and other forms of psychological distress. =Macrophages= It has been argued that depression may be the result of macrophage activity as part of the process of inflammation. = Link between symptoms = Compared to the link between external stressors and inflammation, the connection between peripheral inflammation and depression symptoms is better understood. This is due to cytokines being directly involved with inflammatory responses while also serving as a signal that can lead to changes in behavior. Despite cytokines often being too large to pass through the blood-brain barrier alone, their effect on the central nervous system (CNS) can happen with cytokines entering the CNS in areas where the blood-brain barrier is permeable, by being carried across the blood-brain barrier, or by binding with the cerebral vascular endothelium, thereby signaling the presence of inflammation to the brain. There is also initial evidence that major depression and stress can alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing substances which would normally not be able to pass through enter the brain, thereby increasing the ways peripheral inflammation can affect the brain. Once peripheral cytokines initially communicate the existence of inflammation outside of the CNS, microglia and astrocytes within the CNS are activated and release additional cytokines and chemokines, which then results in the production of neurotransmitters that can contribute to sickness behavior or depression. Although the possibility of maladptive outcomes due to dysregulation, this connection is largely thought to be adaptive due to the benefits of coordinating the CNS with broader immune processes and due to the role immune function in the brain has in facilitating learning and memory.  Incomplete connection  Despite being associated in many ways, the connection between the between depression and inflammation is not complete. This is seen in that immune activity does not appear to be enough on its own to cause depression. Evidence for this comes primarily from treatments that involve the pro- inflammatory IFN-Œ±, which is commonly used in treating viral infections but only results in major depression in about one third of patients. Of the reasons why this might be, one suggestion is that symptoms relating to low mood and anxiety are brought about less in patients relative to increases in symptoms relating to reduced activity and appetite suppression, which tend to almost always occur. This has been seen to indicate that depression as a whole cannot be seen as sickness behavior. However, others have suggested the need for approaches that include illness symptoms as a sub-type of depression, with certain types being more connected to inflammation. In addition to evidence suggesting that inflammation is not sufficient for the development of major depression, evidence for a lack of complete overlap also comes from findings that depression often occurs without existing immune challenges, with social adversity appearing to cause depression without the requirement of underlying inflammation. Similarly, the existence of variation in the degree to which depressed individuals experience inflammation has also been seen to suggest that it is possible that some instances of depression may occur without inflammation. However, it is possible that all instances of depression involve increased inflammation, something which is consistent with the idea that depression may have evolved through the co-option of sickness behavior.  In animals  Although major depression is primarily studied in humans, there is evidence that depression-like symptoms beyond sickness behavior are also seen in non-human animals and that these symptoms often are accompanied by increased inflammation. Primarily seen in experimental studies, these symptoms often take the form of states that appear similar to the helplessness, anxiety, anhedonia, and weight change seen in human depression. However, the degree to which these symptoms are comparable to human symptoms is unknown, with the full suite of cognitive symptoms associated with depression having yet to be found in any study of non-human animals. Compared to the uncertainty about how the behaviors observed in non-human animals are experienced cognitively, there is much more evidence supporting the connection between inflammation and sickness behavior in non-human animals. As with humans, this is mainly seen experimentally, with injections of pro-inflammatory cytokines often resulting in sickness behavior and occasionally other depression-like symptoms. Likewise, the ability for anti-inflammatories to reduce these symptoms is also seen in experimental studies as is seen in humans.  Medical explanations  = From immune response = One explanation for the connection between inflammation and depression symptoms, is that depression is a disorder that stems from immune responses across the body. Due in large part to the systems that bring them about both involving the same pro-inflammatory cytokines, the suggestion is that strong or prolonged immune responses allow for those with susceptibilities to depression to experience it outside of experiences with any other risk factors. Of the ways this might happen, one is that those whose immune responses have been shifted to be pro-inflammatory without sufficient anti-inflammatory compensation have elevated risk of experiencing inflammation intense enough to cause depression. Another suggestion is that variation in neurotransmitter production or receptors may also play a role in one's risk of experiencing inflammation-based depression if certain combinations result in increased risk of inflammation, similarly putting them at risk of maladaptive changes in brain chemistry. However, findings that depression and pro-inflammatory responses do not require the presence of the other for one to develop have led others to argue that the two conditions are often distinct, something which has been suggested to reduce the explanation's appeal to psychiatrists.  Evolutionary explanations  = Pathogen host defense hypothesis = One explanation that sees the connection between depression and inflammation as the result of adaptations is the Pathogen Host Defense Hypothesis (PATHOS-D), which proposes that depression is directly tied to immune responses. From this perspective, depression-like symptoms are thought to reduce energy consumption and reallocate resources so that one can mount a stronger immune defense, thereby reducing the organism's risk of death. In addition to this, both the reduction in activity and social withdrawal that often accompanies depression are also suggested to provide benefits by decreasing one's risk of encountering new pathogens or exposing kin or cooperative partners to one's illness, although they are likely of secondary importance. Beyond serving as an explanation for the connection between depression and inflammation, PATHOS-D was also designed to account for the connection between social stressors and depression. By viewing social adversity as a recurrent cue of likely injury and infection risk across human evolutionary history, social stressors are incorporated into the hypothesis with the expectation that their presence can be used to inform the need to up- regulate immune function before the actual injury or infection risk occurs. As the risk of death in these situations was high ancestrally, false alarms in which social adversity results in one experiencing the costs of depression without any pathogen threat are expected to be common due to the greater costs of failing to respond to an actual threat. Therefore, the benefits of depression in terms of reduced mortality are expected to outweigh the costs of depression throughout our evolutionary history both in terms of false alarms and the costs of depression in general. Although serving as an explanation for the association between depression and increased inflammation levels, the host-defense hypothesis cannot currently explain many of the symptoms outside of reduced activity or social withdrawal. For example, both depression's connection to suicidality and the fact that depression symptoms often persist outside of illness or after a pathogen has been dealt with suggest that there is more to depression than its role as a coordinated immune defense. However, the host-defense hypothesis is not mutually exclusive with other explanations for these occurrences, and it is possible that illness symptoms can be co- opted for other purposes, such as signaling weakness and need for help. = Social signal transduction theory = Closely related to the host-defense hypothesis, the Social Signal Transduction Theory of Depression also directly incorporates social stressors into its explanation for the connection between depression and up-regulated immune responses. However, compared to PATHOS-D, it emphasizes the role of depression as the body's way to prepare itself for the threat of future infection to a greater degree. It also differs in that while PATHOS-D still allows for many cases of depression to be adaptive in Western, Industrialized societies, the Social Signal Transduction Theory expects most instances to be maladaptive. This is due to the expectation that much of the cues indicating risk of injury are less relevant now due to both their lesser connection with violence and the fact that modern medicine has greatly reduced one's risk of death or long-term damage from infection. However, like PATHOS-D, the Social Signal Transduction Theory of Depression has been suggested to be compatible with other explanations, with there being potential for both the cognitive and inflammatory symptoms of depression to be functional in times of social adversity. = Immune dysregulation hypothesis = Another explanation for the connection between depression and inflammation that emphasizes the role of environmental mismatch is the Immune Dysregulation Hypothesis. The Immune Dysregulation hypothesis is based on the old friends hypothesis, which suggests that Western, sanitary environments fail to provide sufficient microorganism exposure to train the immune system to tolerate safe or difficult to eradicate microorganisms, thereby resulting in greater prevalence of the pro-inflammatory phenotypes that typify autoimmune diseases. As depression is also associated with pro-inflammatory responses, the suggestion is that the causes of depression are little different from the causes of the autoimmune diseases it is largely co-morbid with, with sanitary environments increasing the risk of excessive inflammation in response to psychosocial stressors just as it is thought to with otherwise harmless microorganisms. However, evidence of increased inflammation among depressed individuals is also seen among the Tsiman√©, which has been presented as challenge for the Immune Dysregulation Hypothesis' expectation that this association is restricted to Western environments. = Co-opted sickness behavior = An additional explanation for the overlap in symptoms shared by depression and sickness behavior is that the neurobiology associated with sickness behavior was co-opted to result in melancholic symptoms outside of illness by other adaptations. Based largely on the degree of overlap in symptoms major depression, sickness behavior, and starvation depression share, the argument is that sickness behavior likely evolved first due to its prevalence across animal species and the role infection plays as a major fitness threat. However, once the ability to down-regulate behavior to divert resources for immune function existed, the underlying mechanisms could then be used by other systems. This is thought to then allow for additional adaptations that add cognitive symptoms unique to melancholic depression to those stemming from normal sickness behavior. Although likely consistent with any explanation of the evolution as major depression as the result of psychological adaptations, Andrews and Durisko present the co-option hypothesis as mainly consistent with the analytical rumination hypothesis. From this perspective, major depression is thought to often result in improved problem solving due to the redistribution of energy away from physical activity for increased rumination. As this is thought to be energetically costly, it therefore functions very similarly to sickness behavior with it both being adaptive for redistributing energy flows, differing primarily in whether increasing energy goes to cognition or immune defense.

The oldest known dracohorsian is Asilisaurus, dating to about 245 million years ago in the Anisian age of the middle Triassic period.

Of particular debate are the positions of various basal Triassic dinosaurs such as Eodromaeus, Daemonosaurus, Pisanosaurus, and herrerasaurids; and the interrelationships of the major dinosaur groups Sauropodomorpha, Theropoda, and Ornithischia. The reason for this uncertainty is the taxon sampling size and the implications of how they affect the coding for the phylogenetic tree.
