She was built at W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland, in 1960 and was at the time of her delivery the largest and most powerful non- nuclear icebreaker ever built. Shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moskva was decommissioned after a long and successful career along the Northern Sea Route and sold for scrap in 1992. In February 1985, Moskva became the center of international attention when a herd of beluga whales was trapped by ice near the Chukchi Peninsula in the Soviet Far East. The icebreaker broke a channel through the ice pack and managed to lead about 2,000 whales to the open sea.  Construction  Moskva under construction at W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard. In 1956, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to increase the importance and capacity of the Northern Sea Route. This ambitious plan called for the construction of stronger and more powerful icebreakers, including the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker Lenin, that could overcome the challenging ice conditions and extend the navigating season in the Russian Arctic.Horensma, P. The Soviet Arctic. Taylor & Francis e-Library, 2005. .

Following the successful delivery of three smaller diesel-electric icebreakers to the Soviet Union in 1954‚Äì1956, the Finnish shipbuilder W√§rtsil√§ had established itself as one of the leading builders of icebreaking ships. Once when the Soviet minister of commerce Anastas Mikoyan met the W√§rtsil√§ manager Wilhelm Wahlforss, he expressed his satisfaction on quality and performance of Kapitan-class, and casually mentioned, that there is a need for even stronger icebreakers for the polar waters. He listed the requirements on a sheet of paper. Wahlforss called the Hietalahti shipyard manager Eric Holmstr√∂m and the company's icebreaker specialist Ernst B√§ckstr√∂m to a meeting asking: \\"Are we able to construct such a ship?\\" B√§ckstr√∂m answered directly: \\"Yes, we are.\\" Subsequently, B√§ckstr√∂m made a 1:500-scaled sketch of the new 22,000-hp icebreaker in relation to Kapitan-class. Wahlforss took the drawing with him in 1954 to a meeting in Moscow where he had dinner with Mikoyan. When Mikoyan opened the discussion about the new icebreaker concept, Wahlforss took the drawing from his suitcase asking \\"Is this what you need?\\". Mikoyan became very delighted and said: \\"For three years I have asked from our own shipyards for possibility to construct such a icebreaker, but I have only got headshaking!\\" On 24 May 1956, W√§rtsil√§ and Sudoimport, the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract for the construction of two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000hp Lenin, the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time. The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised W√§rtsil√§ to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's engineering expertise to a tough test. At the end, however, W√§rtsil√§ could deliver what Wahlforss had promised. Few years later, W√§rtsil√§ received a follow-up order for three more icebreakers of the same design. The hull of the icebreaker was assembled on a slipway and launched on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be dredged. In addition, a special steel pontoon had to be constructed and welded to the stern of the icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull. In the launching ceremony, the new icebreaker was given the name Moskva after the capital city. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and Moskva was delivered during the summer of 1960.  Service history  In October 1961, after assisting more than a hundred cargo ships in the Russian Arctic during the autumn navigating season, Moskva completed an eastbound transit of the Northern Sea Route from Murmansk to Vladivostok in only 10 days. This was both a record time as well as the latest time a successful transit had been completed before the winter, and demonstrated how the shipping season could be extended with modern icebreakers. Afterwards, Moskva was stationed in Vladivostok and used to escort in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route. On 20 October 1965, Moskva and her sister ship Leningrad came to assist Vitimles, a merchant ship that had been waiting for icebreaker assistance for 30 days in the East Siberian Sea. However, by the time the icebreakers arrived, the pack ice had begun to drift at a considerable speed and a dangerous phenomenon known as \\"ice jet\\" appeared,Weintrit, A. and Neumann, T. (2013): Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation. CRC Press. Page 462. immobilizing the icebreakers. The ice pressure caused severe damage to Vitimles and the ship, which had been built in Poland only a year before, sank with no loss of life on 24 October. During the same season, both icebreakers also damaged their propellers due to the severe ice conditions. In 1966, Moskva was awarded the Order of Lenin for her successful service on the Northern Sea Route.Lenin- palkinto Suomessa tehdylle j√§√§nmurtajalle. Helsingin Sanomat, 9 August 2016. While new and more powerful icebreakers were built in the 1970s and 1980s, Moskva continued to escort merchant ships in the eastern part of the Northern Sea Route. However, already by the mid-1980s the icebreaker was described as being \\"definitely past its prime\\". Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the traffic volumes along the Northern Sea Route declined drastically in the early 1990s due to the slowdown of the Russian economy. As a result, it was decided to decommission the Moskva-class icebreakers. The oldest vessel of the series, Moskva, was sold for scrap in 1992. The name was later given to a 2008-built diesel-electric icebreaker, the first non-nuclear icebreaker delivered by a Russian shipyard in more than three decades. = Operation Beluga = Admiral Makarov (left) and Moskva in 1992, shortly before the latter was sold for scrap. Both vessels were involved in two separate whale rescue operations in the 1980s. In late December 1984, a Chukchi hunter spotted a herd of up to 3,000 beluga whales struggling for breathing room in small pools of open water in the ice-covered waters off the Chukchi Peninsula. Easterly winds had packed the narrow Senyavin Strait with drift ice up to thick, creating a wide ice pack that the whales could not cross on a single breath. While the locals tried to keep the animals alive by feeding them with frozen fish and keeping the breathing holes open, it soon became evident that the belugas would eventually perish unless they could be freed.Ice Breaker Suite. Our Fascinating Earth. Russians tell saga of whales rescued by an icebreaker. New York Times, 12 March 1985. In February 1985, Moskva was called from the Bering Sea in to break a channel through the ice pack and free the trapped herd. On 22 February, the icebreaker finally reached the belugas, but at first they refused to follow the ship to open water. However, when the crew began playing classical music through the ship's loudspeakers, the whales finally followed Moskva to the unfrozen sea. In the end, it was estimated that about 2,000 whales escaped while slightly more than 500 were taken by the local hunters.Russian Icebreaker Whale Rescue Delayed. Discovery, 20 December 2011. Using Moskva for the rescue operation, dubbed \\"Operation Beluga\\", cost the Soviet government about $80,000.Soviet Ship Cracks Wall of Ice to Free Trapped Whales. Los Angeles Times, 22 February 1985. Moscow saving the whales. UPI, 22 February 1985. In 1988, a similar rescue operation was attempted to free three gray whales from pack ice in the Beaufort Sea near Point Barrow, Alaska. As part of the $1 million effort, the United States Department of State requested help from the Soviet Union who sent two icebreakers, Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev, to break the ice trapping the whales.  Technical details  = General characteristics = Moskva was long overall and at the waterline. At the widest point of the hull, the vessel had a beam of , but due to the sloping sides the maximum beam at waterline was slightly less, . At design waterline, the icebreaker drew of water and had a displacement of 13,290 tonnes. However, the maximum draught of the vessel was , corresponding to a maximum displacement of 15,360 tonnes. Moskva was the largest non-nuclear icebreaker in the world at the time of the delivery, having almost twice the displacement of the largest western icebreakers. Designed to withstand the compression of the polar pack ice, the fully welded steel hull of Moskva was very strong. The wide ice belt, where the hull plating was over thick in the bow, was designed to withstand ice pressures of up to 1,000 tonnes per square meter (about ), more than 30 to 60 times as much as normal merchant ships at the time. In bow and stern, the web frames were aligned perpendicularly to the shell plating. Longitudinally, the hull was divided into nine watertight compartments and the vessel had a full-length double hull below tweendeck. Moskva had single and double cabins for 109 persons. In addition to vessel crew and aviation detachment, accommodation and laboratories were reserved for scientists when the icebreaker carried out research expeditions in the polar waters. Special attention had been paid to the furnishing and decoration of the public spaces, which included a game room and a music room with a piano for the officers. The icebreaker was delivered from the shipyard with a total of three television sets. Designed to escort merchant ships through ice-covered waters, Moskva had a towing winch and a notch in the stern where the bow of the towed ship would be pulled. For ice reconnaissance, the icebreaker had a helicopter hangar and a landing platform in the stern. The vessel had two motor lifeboats for 60 persons and two 70-person lifeboats with manually operated propeller. In addition, the icebreaker carried a motor launch with a steel hull, a aluminum boat, two fiberglass ice sledge-boats, a rowing boat and a light aluminum dinghy. The boats were launched using the icebreakers' two 10-ton deck cranes. = Power and propulsion = Moskva was a diesel-electric icebreaker with a power plant consisting of eight 9-cylinder W√§rtsil√§-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting two-stroke diesel engines, each of which was rated at 3,250hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to Siemens direct current (DC) generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied Ward Leonard drive system. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure. The electric power produced by the main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side by side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder. With an overall propulsion power of 22,000hp, Moskva was at the time the most powerful diesel-electric icebreaker in the world. She was second only to the nuclear-powered Lenin which, at 44,000hp, had twice the power of the Moskva-class icebreakers. While the most powerful western icebreaker at the time, the 1955-built USS Glacier, had two propulsion motors rated at 10,500hp each and was thus nearly as powerful as Moskva, the American icebreaker could maintain this power level only for a period of four hours at a time and the total continuous rating was only 16,900hp.The Icebreaker USS/USCGC Glacier.

His appearance in the entertainment world helped spawn the Kyodai Hero genre with countless shows such as Godman and Iron King. Ultraman first appeared as the titular character alongside his human host Shin Hayata in the 1966‚Äì1967 Japanese television series, Ultraman which ran for 39 episodes. Following Ultraman's success, Tsuburaya created another Kyodai hero series still as part of their Ultra Series project, Ultra Seven. While both series shared the same genre with very similar heroes, there was originally no relations between the two. It was not until The Return of Ultraman was created four years later in 1971 that both Ultraman and Ultra Seven came together into the same story. This event cemented Tsuburaya Productions' decision to have the Ultra Series continue to follow the trend of focusing on an Ultraman with each new entry. The original red-and-silver giant hero himself enjoyed a long series of popularity and has continued to appear in various works in the Ultra Series. Apart from that, he also has a lot of popularity trademarks which make him memorable to this day: his Color Timer, the Specium Ray stance and his famous cry . In the series, Ultraman's grunts and his iconic shout \\"Shuwatch\\" were provided by , who would later voice him as an actual character in episode 33 during his fight with Alien Mefilas. His dialogue in episodes 1 and 39 were provided by while in episode 15, he was voiced by , the narrator of episodes 1 to 19. In subsequent appearances, Ultraman reuses Masao's grunt while his voice being provided by Susumu Kurobe (Shin Hayata's actor) or just simply being speechless during the screen time. Ultraman's suit actor was during the original season. He would later went on to portray Ultra Guard member Amagi, one of the characters in the later series, Ultra Seven. Ultraman appeared in later works of the Ultra Series played by various voice and suit actors. Although Susumu Kurobe did reprise his role as Hayata or provided the voice of Ultraman himself at times (though his grunts were still reused from the late Masao Nakasone) but there are other occasions where he was voiced by other voice actors. The Ultraman brand generated in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the world's third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia. Character conception Ultraman's suit variations in 1966: Type A (left), Type B (middle) and Type C (right) Writer Tetsuo Kinjo originally envisioned an intergalactic reptilian creature named Bemler to be the character that would become Ultraman. The creature could grow in size to 164 feet, with the design being a cross between Garuda and Tengu. Ultraman's memorable design was done by Tohl Narita and clay sculptor Akira Sasaki, with the grey alien concept in mind. Three Ultraman body suits were created for the show, all of which were based on the size of suit actor Bin Furuya. A lot of improvements to Ultraman's design were made during the series' progression. The first suit was known as Type A (episodes 1 to 13), followed by Type B (14‚Äì29) and finally Type C (30 and subsequent episodes). The Type A suit had its mask created from fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) and coated with latex, giving Ultraman a \\"wrinkled\\" face. The mask was originally intended to have a mouth-opening mechanism but the latex-coating prevented such functions. Bin Furuya mentioned that Type A fitted him poorly and it forced him to hunch a bit. Followed by the deterioration of the Type A suit, Type B was made later on. Its mask removed the mouth-opening mechanism concept and latex coating, opting instead for a full FRP cover. Some of the staff in the series were not made aware of the changes that were made and were surprised by Ultraman's face having the sudden change from an alien-like face to an \\"iron mask\\" looking face. The Type B mask even had its jaw feature more narrow and sharpened compared to the Type A design. Type B was also bigger compared to Type A and according to Furuya; \\"it was better fitting, and had padding so it looked like Ultraman was more muscular\\". The Type C suit was nonetheless an improved variant of Type B, which featured slight changes in the facial positions of the eyes, mouth and ears. The rest of the body of each suit was a painted wetsuit, a design choice that was previously used for the Kemur Man from Ultra Q, the series that preceded Ultraman. Type A's boots were derived from modified Jika-tabi, Type B variant were pointed shoes with hidden zippers and Type C were red leather shoes painted silver. Due to being made with using wet-suits and latices, the suits were incapable of sustaining long periods of time. What happened to each of the suits were as follows: *Type A: Was decommissioned due to deterioration, its mask had aged poorly due to its latex-coating. It was briefly modified into Imitation Ultraman for episode 18. *Type B: Was put into storage after the Type C suit was commissioned. It was later stolen from Tsuburaya's warehouse sometime in the 1970s and its current location and status are unknown. *Type C: Was handed over to the programming staff following the series' conclusion. The mask was removed at that time due to being poorly-aged. According to Furuya, the original Ultraman suit was destroyed, but it is unknown if this story is actually true. =The Color Timer= Ultraman's victory was never assured, as Ultraman's powers and, indeed, his very life force, came from solar energy, which was heavily reduced by Earth's filtering atmosphere. His time limit was stated to be three minutes, though certain scenes do show him capable of still fighting while exceeding this limit. When Ultraman first appeared, his , was a rich cyan color. As time goes on, the color timer turns solid red, and then starts to blink, giving off a warning chime as it did so. When Ultraman runs out of energy, the color timer goes out, and turns black. Ultraman's color timer is linked directly to his heart, and damaging it will cause mortal injury or serious pain to Ultraman. Ultraman and other Ultra Warriors from M-78 receive their Color Timers through modification surgery in hopes of notifying them about energy reduction when fighting against monster threats in certain planets or locations. According to Tohl Narita, Ultraman was not originally meant to have a time limit, as the original design he made lacked one. This was actually made to reduce the cost of the special effects. The protagonist of the succeeding series, Ultra Seven, averted this through his forehead \\"Beam Lamp\\" feature but subsequent Ultra Warriors after Seven, however, returned to the time limit trend. These cases were explained by Tsuburaya that Seven's lack of Color Timer is due to his early days as a non-combatant officer, as he was only sent to observe the Milky Way before getting involved in the Earth's affairs. =Naming= The name Ultraman was originally what the alien spaceman from Nebula M78 called himself when he spoke to a comatose Hayata about merging their forms as compensation for the accident that caused their ships to collide. After Ultraman's first battle with the monster Bemular, Ide asks Hayata what the hero's name is; Hayata replies \\"Does 'Ultraman' sound all right?\\" This originally implied that the name was conceived by Hayata himself, but later appearances by other aliens and Zoffy confirm that it is his actual name. In certain media, Ultraman was referred to as . Dating back to 1971, the emergence of the main character of the fourth Ultra Series, The Return of Ultraman would cause confusion due to sharing the same name, hence the original was called Original Ultraman and the second incarnation was called before he received his own name, by Noboru Tsuburaya, Tsuburaya Productions' president at that time. Said name is also one of the original concepts of Ultraman Taro and it first appeared in acknowledgement during the 1984 film, Ultraman Story. Additionally, Ultraman Jack was meant to be Ultraman returning to Earth but was made as a separate character out of respect to the late Eiji Tsuburaya, who passed away in 1970. History =Showa era= Ultraman is an that hails from Nebula M78. While chasing the space monster Bemular, he accidentally collided with SSSP Officer Shin Hayata who was on a patrolling duty. Feeling guilty for playing a part in his death, Ultraman merged their bodies together and gave Shin the Beta Capsule. From that day forward, Ultraman staunchly defended Earth against aliens and monsters, with Shin Hayata and the SSSP assisting him. While Hayata worked alongside his fellow SSSP members, he would switch to Ultraman, should the situation call for it. In the series finale, a race of aliens from the planet Zetton, and their vanguard kaiju, Zetton (named after its planet of origin), attack. Ultraman, aided by the SSSP, battled Zetton, but before Zetton was defeated, he mortally wounded Ultraman with a weapon the hero had not expected, one that directly targeted his Color Timer/warning light. That damage caused him to lose almost all his energy instantly. When Zoffy, Ultraman's superior, arrived to retrieve the fallen hero with a special life energy, Ultraman pleaded for Hayata's life to also be spared, going as far as to offer his new life to the human, so that Hayata could live as a normal man. Zoffy agreed with Ultraman and gave Hayata a spare life energy, he then separated them, but left Hayata with no memory between the time that he first collided with Ultraman's ship (in the first episode), and the time that he is shown standing outside the Science Special Search Party Headquarters, holding the Beta Capsule but apparently not knowing what it is or what it does as he watched Zoffy take Ultraman home. This is a rather different finish to the series than stated in the English dub, which states both that Ultraman will return and that Hayata retains not only his Beta Capsule but also, apparently, his full memories of all his experiences as he awaits Ultraman's return. Coincidentally, this ending appears to have become the definitive ending to Tsuburaya, as Hayata reappears several times throughout succeeding Ultra Series as Ultraman's host in times of need. Revive! Ultraman gives an alternate ending to the series 29 years after the series finale, where Zoffy recombines Hayata and Ultraman after giving the former another life-force. After the battle against Zetton, both Hayata and Ultraman were shaken to the core following their previous defeat. Past monsters were mysteriously revived and Ultraman defeated them again but is once again weakened by Zetton. When it seemed that his defeat would be repeated, SSSP member Ide created a specialized formula that replenished Ultraman's energy, allowing him to finally defeating Zetton and properly put an end to his mission on Earth. He would later join the , a group of Ultra Warriors dedicated to protecting the galaxy. =Subsequent history in the Showa era=The Return of Ultraman (1971): Appeared in episode 38, he and Ultraseven rescued Ultraman Jack who was defeated by Alien Nackle. Though not appearing at first, he communicated with Go/Ultraman Jack via telepathy in episode 51. In the latter episode, he was voiced by . *Ultraman Ace (1972): Appeared in episodes 1, 13, 14, 26 and 27 but out of all episodes, the only scene that featured him talking was in episode 13 with his voice provided by . He was shown witnessing Ace's fusion with Hokuto and Minami. In subsequent appearances, he and his Ultra Brothers were captured by Yapool in episodes 13 and 14 and by Alien Hipporito in 26 and 27. His suit in episode 1 is simply repainted from Ultraman Jack. *Ultraman Taro (1973): Appeared in episodes 1, 25, 33, 34 and 40. In episode 1, he was among the Ultra Brothers that witnessed the fusion if Ultraman Taro and Kotaro and later deliver the Ultra Bell to the Ultra Tower in episode 25. In 33 and 34, he and the rest of the Ultra Brothers joined Taro on Earth while fighting against Alien Temperor. In episode 40, he was the first to fight Tyrant on Uranus, but defeated in the end. *Ultraman Leo (1974): Appeared in episodes 38 and 39. He and the Ultra Brothers tried to confront Astra, who had stolen the Ultra Key from the Land of Light until he was revealed to be an impostor named Alien Babarue by Ultraman King. He is voiced by . *The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army (1974 (Thailand)/1979 (Japan)): In this work, Ultraman was voiced by . *Ultraman 80: Ultraman was mentioned by Ultraman 80 during the latter's battle against Alien Baltan VI as he used the same cutting halo to defeat his opponent. Ultraman's \\"reappearance\\" here was reused from episode 16 of the original series. *Ultraman Zoffy: Ultra Warriors vs. the Giant Monster Army (1984): In this work, Ultraman is voiced by . *Ultraman Story (1984): Kenyu Horiuchi reprises his role in this work. =Heisei era=Ultraman Zearth (1996): Ultraman was referenced multiple times in this movie, as his giant statue which was dedicated to his series' 30th anniversary was quickly eaten by Cotton-Poppe. When Katsuto/Ultraman Zearth performed his Speciu-shula Ray in front of a mirror, Ultraman's image can be seen on his reflection. In the second movie, Ultraman was referenced again where his defeat by Zetton becomes an inspiration for MYDO officers to create a cannon with a similar energy beam output to Zetton's to defeat Lady Benzene's Ultraman Shadow. However the plan backfired, not only because of Shadow not being a genuine Ultraman but of quickly setting up a protector on his Color Timer the moment the beam hit his chest, which resulted in reflecting it back to MYDO. *Ultraman Tiga (1996): Appeared in episode 49, Ultraman assisted Ultraman Tiga to defeat monster Yanakahgi. Considering that Tiga is from an entirely different timeline than the original Nebula M78 universe, so a lot of plot contortions are made in order to bring together this dream team, to honor the 30th anniversary of the original Ultraman. Thus, the Ultraman in question here is in fact an alternate universe version. He is voiced by . *Ultraman Mebius & Ultraman Brothers (2006): In this movie, it was revealed that Ultraman, Ultraseven, Ultraman Jack and Ultraman Ace had sealed Yapool and his Super Beast, U-Killersaurus, beneath the lake of Kobe at the cost of most of their energy. In the end, they assumed human lives, Ultraman masking himself as Hayata. 20 years later, Hayata becomes the airport administrator in Kobe Airport and approaches himself to Mirai Hibino (the human form of Ultraman Mebius) alongside his comrades, giving him advice after being shaken due to being unable to save a young boy in the past. The human Ultra Brothers later witnessed Mebius' battle against an alien group that had arrived to revive Yapool. When Mebius was unable to handle the invaders, the Ultra Brothers had no choice but to transform again for the first time in 20 years. But even after Mebius was rescued, they quickly fell prey to the aliens' trap and were used to unseal Yapool before they could stop them. While fighting against Yapool/U-Killersaurus, Zoffy and Ultraman Taro came to their aid and replenished their energies. With the Ultra Brothers united, they combined with Mebius to form Mebius Infinity to defeat Yapool and freed Kobe. As this film also commemorated the 40th anniversary of the Ultra Series and Ultraman, the character himself was given a wrinkled face, in tribute to the original Type A suit. *Ultraman Mebius (2006): Following the events of the movie, Ultraman returned in episode 47 and 50 of the series. After Alien Mefilas brainwashed the whole population into his servants, Mirai seeks Hayata's help but he was not able to do anything as Mefilas' actions were not endangering the civilians. However, after seeing Ultraman Mebius fighting against Mefilas (the latter almost killing the GUYS officers), Hayata was able to interfere again as Ultraman and ended the fight with no losses on both sides, telling Mefilas to retreat instead. The alien complied to his wishes and looked forward to their next confrontation, although he was killed by Alien Empera shortly after due to his incompetence. He later had a short conversation with Teppei Kuze, one of the GUYS officers, and was among the Ultra Warriors that cleansed the Sun from Alien Empera's sunspot. *Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers (2008): In this work, Ultraman is also an alternate universe character who came to Earth alongside his comrades, Ultra Seven, Ultraman Jack and Ultraman Ace. Having arrived on Earth, they assumed the lives of mundane civilians with Ultraman disguising himself as bike shop owner Shin Hayata, having married Akiko Fuji and having a daughter named Rena Hayata (based on Rena Yanase from Ultraman Tiga). Having lived on Earth for a long time, they eventually forgotten their actual identities. This, however, changes when the safety of their Earth were threatened by unnamed dark figures, until their wives reminded them whom they really were, allowing Hayata and the others to regain their memories and powers as Ultra Warriors, assisting the alternate Heisei Ultra Warriors and Ultraman Mebius (the prime reality version which was forcefully brought into their universe) against their enemy. In the end, after Daigo completed the space vessel which meant to bring its passengers to the Land of Light, Hayata and his comrades join along with their wives, as Hayata and Akiko rode a space vessel that resembles the SSSP's Jet VTOL. This work also reuses the \\"New Type A\\" face used by Ultraman in the previous film. =Galaxy Crisis era= For the following appearances below, refer to List of Mega Monster Battle characters#Ultra Brothers: *Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle (2007): Ultraman pursued the evil Alien Raybrad but was defeated and petrified in a mountain on the planet Boris until Reimon and ZAP SPACY freed him.

In the director's cut version of the movie, the Ultra Brothers arrived to assist Ultraman Saga in fighting against Hyper Zetton's revived monster army. Ultraman fought against Antlar, an old foe from his time on Earth. =New Generation Heroes era=Ultraman Ginga (2013): Alongside the Ultra Brothers, Ultraman was among the combatants of the Dark Spark War, fighting against Zetton but soon cursed into a Spark Doll by Dark Lugiel when he and the rest of the Space Garrisons tried to protect Taro (thus making him the only Spark Doll to retain sentience in the series). His Spark Doll soon fell into Dark Lugiel's hands and was used by Seiichir≈ç Isurugi alongside Ultra Seven against Ultraman Ginga before the man was defeated, allowing Hikaru (Ginga's host) to recover it. Chigusa briefly uses the Spark Doll alongside Kenta (Ultraman Tiga) and a reformed Seiichir≈ç to hold off Super Grand King for Ginga to free Misuzu. In the aftermath of Ginga's battle with Lugiel, Ultraman and the other Spark Dolls were lifted from their curse and returned to space. In the Extra Episode, a copy of Ultraman's Spark Doll was utilized by Chigusa again to fight Zetton, who was controlled by Dark Lugiel's former minion, Alien Magma. Previously in 2013, he was present in an award ceremony when the Ultra Series was nominated as the series with the most spin-offs and sequels, holding the certificate given by Guinness World Records with Takuya Negishi, Hikaru Raido's actor in Ultraman Ginga. *Ultraman Ginga Theater Special: Ultra Monster ‚òÜ Hero Battle Royal! (2014): Ultraman was among the sketches that Tomoya draw in his book until a strange cosmic energy wave took effect thus materializing Ultraman and other sketches into Spark Dolls. Ultraman was used by Tomoya when he and his friends tried to play using Ultra Warrior Spark Dolls until software bugs created a group of five Dark Ultramen for them to fight. Tomoya/Ultraman fights against Chaosroid U and wins by firing his Specium Ray. *Ultraman Ginga S (2014): As revealed in episode 54 of Shin Ultraman Retsuden, Ultraman and the rest of the Ultra Brothers donated their powers to Taro when he raced to Earth after detecting a new threat.

After his job on Earth ended, Taro returned the loaned powers back to the Ultra Brothers. *Ultraman X The Movie (2016): Ultraman was summoned by the blue stone that was previously used to seal Zaigorg and assisted Ultraman Tiga and Ultraman X against Zaigorg and his Devil Clone Beasts. Facing Gorg Fire Golza, Ultraman finds himself accompanied by Asuna via Xio Bazooka and Wataru in Land Musketty. With Ultraman injured by Golza's cannonball, Asuna and Wataru used the powers of Cyber Gomora and Cyber Zetton respectively to delay Golza while Ultraman recovers and destroyed it with his Specium Ray. After being captured and had its energy stolen by Zaigorg, Ultraman's Cyper Card resonated with Ultraman X and created the Beta Spark Armor, with X using it to free Ultraman and Tiga. Both him and Tiga participated in the formation of Cyber Wing to ease the worldwide Ultras' battles with Tsurugi Demaaga. After the battle ended, Ultraman took his leave, followed by Ultraman X. *Ultraman Orb (2016): Ultraman was the one who sealed Maga-Zetton until it was reawakened sometime prior to the series. Maga-Zetton fought Ultraman Orb and was defeated, revealing Ultraman's Ultra Fusion Card but the ensuing battle turned the entire forest area into a smoldering crater. Alongside Ultraman Tiga, Ultraman's power is channeled to Ultraman Orb when using the form Spacium Zeperion, which allowed him to use Ultraman's power as well. In his human form of Gai Kurenai, he is able to utilize Ultraman's power in a smaller range by reflecting an incoming attack, having first used to counter Alien Zetton Maddock. During the final episode of the series, Ultraman and the other Ultra Fusion Cards in Gai's possession transform into physical projections of themselves to assist Ultraman Orb in delivering the finishing blow on Magata no Orochi while Juggler hold off the monster long enough to expose its weak spot. *Ultraman Geed (2017): Alongside the Ultra Brothers, Ultraman participated in a fight against Belial before he was caught in the Crisis Impact. His power lives on through his Ultra Capsule, called an as Riku used it in unison with the Belial Capsule to assume Ultraman Geed (Primitive). According to director Koichi Sakamoto, said form utilizes the brutish strength of Belial while retaining Ultraman's heart of justice. In the final episode, Ultraman was among the Ultras whose beings resonated with Geed's spirit during his final fight with Belial Atrocious, as Ultraman King materialized other four clones of his Fusion Rise forms to join the battle. *Ultraman R/B (2018): Ultraman and Belial's R/B Crystals were among those in Saki's possession before she relinquished it to Asahi. *Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes (2019): Alongside members of the Ultra Brothers, Ultraman was mentioned to have fought against Ultra Dsrk-Killer and succeeded by donating his energy to Taro. After the fiend revived and established the League of Darkness, the Ultra Brothers assembled the New Generation Heroes and observe their battle from the Land of Light. =Reiwa Era=Ultraman Z (2020): His power inhabited the , one of the many Ultra Medals manufactured in the Land of Light. When Genegarg stole them and was destroyed by Ultraman Z's Zestium Beam, said Medal was among those scattered from the explosion and salvaged by STORAGE member Yoko. She would give it to the Ultra, allowing Z to assume Beta Smash. Profile Ultraman's statistics below were never mentioned in the original series, but were brought up in magazines and official websites. There are also certain succeeding series that deviate Ultraman's original statistics: *Height: 40 m (50 m in episode 40 of Ultraman Taro) *Weight: 35,000 t *Flight Speed: Mach 5 *Birthplace: Nebula M78, Land of Light *Age: Over 20,000 years old *Year Debut: 1966 *First Appearance: The Birth of Ultraman (1966) =Description= As the official website of Tsuburaya Productions stated: \\"[Ultraman] visited the Earth after chasing the Space Monster Bemular, he protected the Earth against monster and alien threats. Aside from his main attack Specium Ray, he also possesses a number of techniques. His place of origin is Nebula M78. Despite his strength, he is also friendly to non-hostile monsters. His human form on Earth is Shin Hayata of the Science Special Search-Party. He is also a member of the Ultra Brothers.\\" =Transformation= Hayata himself transform into Ultraman through the use of the , a flashlight-like object which allows him to switch between his human state and Ultraman. By pressing the red button on the capsule, a stream of light forms a spiral-like circle which warped his body as Ultraman rises, appearing in a manner that involves his right arm forming a fist forward and his left folded down. The Beta Capsule is always shown stored in Hayata's SSSP jacket. In episode 22 of Ultraman, the Beta Capsule (or to a lesser extent, Ultraman's power) had the ability to free Hayata from external influence, as the Underground People tried to control Ultraman by brainwashing Hayata until Ultraman's transformation freed him. But despite this, the gadget can also be easily lost, as shown in episode 26 during Ultraman's fight with Gomora, where he accidentally dropped it and it was picked up by a local boy who mistook it for a toy. This was also played for the sake of comedy as seen in episode 34 when Hayata mistook a curry spoon for the Beta Capsule before switching to the original one. Two other versions also existed: *In the beginning of Ultraman X The Movie, Dr. Guruman attempted to replicate the Beta Capsule in hopes of summoning Ultraman. But instead, it triggered a chain reaction that sets the whole research lab in Operation Base X in explosion. *Ultraman's data was later used by Guruman to create his Cyber Card, which soon brings forth the creation of for Daichi to use with X Park Lence and transform into Ultraman Exceed X Beta Spark Armor. In the original concept for The Return of Ultraman, Hideki Goh (the series' main protagonist) was meant to use the Beta Capsule to become Ultraman Jack. =Other forms=: Featured in Superior 8 Ultraman Brothers. Ultraman and the alternate Ultra Warriors received strength from the citizens' hopes and gained a power boost that was identical to Tiga's Glitter Tiga. His attack, combined with the alternate Ultras, was called , made by combining their original finisher attacks. *: The corrupted form of Ultraman, which first appeared during the events of Ultraman Ginga. After Seiichir≈ç Isurugi was given the Spark Dolls of Ultraman and Ultraseven, the given to him allows the man to assume the corrupted forms of the two Ultra Warriors, Ultraman Dark and Ultra Seven Dark respectively. Ultraman Dark's appearance is identical to Ultraman, but with black colors replacing the original silver, and Ultraman's eyes and Color Timer both shine red. His attacks retain the same name and power statistics, though they appear to be darker. Ultraman Dark (Seiichir≈ç) first appeared after Ultraman Ginga defeated Zaragas, and brutally attacked the Ultra Warrior before swapping out with Ultra Seven, but before he could deliver the finishing blow, Seiichir≈ç was stopped by Misuzu Isurugi, his daughter. Ultraman's Spark Doll was returned to normal after Ultraman Ginga defeated Seiichir≈ç. The suit of Ultraman Dark was reused from Ultraman Geist, another evil doppelg√§nger of Ultraman that appeared in certain stage shows. Also, the third volume of Ultraman Ginga's Blu-ray DVD release stated that his conception was based on Imitation Ultraman, a disguise assumed by Alien Zarab from episode 18 of Ultraman. In the 2014 crossover game Super Hero Generation, he demonstrated the attacks and . =Powers and abilities= Ultraman's combat technique usually relied on brute strength, which goes by fighting his opponents in melee combat, then finishing them with his beam attacks. In the middle of combat, he sometimes used different skills that either assist him in the combat or neutralize dangerous situations that the SSSP are involved in. His skin possessed natural protection against extreme heat, electricity and atomic bomb explosions. His signature attack was the , which was performed by having his forearms form a cross stance, with his left arm in a horizontal position and placed forward while his right arm is in a vertical position and placed backward, reflecting a shuriken. This finisher launches a beam of white energy which consists of an extraterrestrial mineral called that can be found on Mars (ep. 2). When his arms form the \\"+\\" stance, his right hand emits negative Specium and his left arm emits positive Specium, thus creating a destruction beam with the heat of 500,000 degrees and power level of 500,000 horsepower. Said mineral itself is the main weakness of Alien Baltan, one of the adversaries of Ultraman, and is frequently used to defeat other monsters-of- the-week. However, Specium also has a counterpart, Spellgen, which was used by the second generation Alien Baltan (ep. 16) to counteract the Specium Ray, prompting Ultraman to slice the Alien in half with the Ultra Slash attack. Certain monsters in the series have been shown to be resistant to the Specium Ray, and took more than one shot to be killed. Ultraman also uses the , an energy projectile saw disc attack launched from Ultraman's right arm in a manner of a flying disc. This is mainly used to dismember an opponent, usually by slicing them into half down the middle. Like the Specium Ray, it had its own weakness, certain opponents like Gubila (ep 23) or Kiyla (ep 39) were able to catch the disk moments before it hit them and throw it back at the Ultra Warrior. There are also other non-conventional uses for the Ultra Slash: *In episode 13 (the final episode) of Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle, Ultraman summoned the Ultra Slash from his left arm and instead of throwing it, he used it to chop off King Joe Black's left arm in a similar manner to a karate chop to save the ZAP Spacy's Space Pendragon and escape Planet Boris. *In Ultraman X The Movie, Ultraman first used the Ultra Slash in a manner of a shield to defend himself from Gorg Fire Golza's attack before it launched towards the monster. Human hosts/forms =Shin Hayata= , or full name is the protagonist of the Ultraman TV series. He is 25 years old at the start of the series; he first encountered Ultraman when the giant hero accidentally collided with Hayata's VTOL Jet with his \\"Travel Sphere\\". Feeling guilty about the accident, Ultraman fuses himself with Hayata to ensure the man's survival, causing them to share the same life, also giving Hayata the means to fight against monster and alien threats. He is the Sub-Captain of the Science Special Search-Party and is in charge whenever Captain Toshio Muramatsu is unavailable. Although portrayed as a dutiful officer, there are also times where he was out of focus, sometimes for the sake of comedy. His connection to Ultraman remains a secret to the rest of the SSSP members even until the series finale, however in episode 14 Muramatsu and member Arashi noticed that Hayata shared a similar injury to Ultraman after his fight against a monster. This was never brought up again later on. In episode 39, the series finale, both Ultraman and Hayata were gravely injured after Zetton defeated them. Zoffy arrived to recover Ultraman and gave Hayata another life, allowing him to live while being separated from Ultraman. In the original Japanese ending, Hayata was left without any memories of Ultraman, but in the English dub, he retained his memory while telling his SSSP teammates that Ultraman would return to Earth. Coincidentally, this ending appears to have become the definitive ending to Tsuburaya, as Hayata later appeared in subsequent series with Ultraman. Revive! Ultraman also gave an alternate ending that allowed Hayata to retain both his connection with Ultraman and his memories. Although Hayata does appear in person later on in other Ultra Series entries, starting from the following events of Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy, it was revealed that Hayata is no longer the original human who became one with Ultraman, but rather the Ultra Warrior in a human form, in a similar manner to Dan Moroboshi with Ultra Seven. While the reason for this is unknown, it is possible that Hayata and Ultraman separated sometime after Ultraman Mebius or the fact that since Return of Ultraman, the two never met again, thus \\"Hayata\\" becomes his human form ever since Ultraman's re-emergence. Hayata is portrayed by in all of his appearances. Originally, there was no audition for the role of Hayata, and he simply took the role after execs \\"ordered\\" him to take it without a choice. =Other hosts= In certain circumstances, Ultraman would possess other people as substitute human hosts. *In episode 33 and 34 of Ultraman Taro, the Ultra Brothers possessed the male ZAT officers in order to hide themselves from Alien Temperor, who was hunting them on Earth, and to teach Kotaro Higashi/Ultraman Taro not to be arrogant and to not rely on his brothers-in-arms too much. Ultraman possessed the ZAT officer and later a volleyball player once Temperor saw through their deception. *In Ultraman Ginga, Ultraman was transformed into a Spark Doll and was among those in Dark Lugiel's possession. It later ends up in Hikaru's possession. Ultraman would later be freed once Dark Lugiel was defeated, although another Ultraman Spark Doll appeared certain times after the series: Ultraman's original Spark Doll at first was given to alongside Ultra Seven's Spark Doll. Having been corrupted by Alien Nackle Gray, he used Ultraman's corrupted power, turning him into the dark Ultra Warriors Ultraman Dark and Ultra Seven Dark. He defeated Hikaru in their first encounter and invited him in his quest to rule over everything, but was rejected and defeated by Hikaru. Seiichir≈ç's defeat had saved him from Gray's brainwashing and purified the two Ultra Warriors' Spark Dolls. He would later use the Ultra Seven Spark Doll for good to assist Ultraman Ginga when his daughter Misuzu falls victim to it like him. In order to assist Ultraman Ginga in rescuing Misuzu from Gray's influence, Ultraman's Spark Doll was used by to help delay Super Grand King while Hikaru tried to reach Misuzu. She would later use the Spark Doll copy of Ultraman on two occasions, first against Alien Magma and Zetton in the extra episode of Ultraman Ginga and later in Mountain Peanuts (a magazine novel which served as a prologue to Ginga S) against Android One-Zero/Nosferu. During the events of Ultraman Ginga Theater Special: Ultra Monster ‚òÜ Hero Battle Royal!, Ultraman's Spark Doll was among the copies which were created when 's sketchbook of Ultra Monsters radiated strange cosmic waves. Tomoya would later use the Spark Doll when playing with his comrades but later participated in a fight against a group of five evil Ultramen, facing Chaosroid U. Ultraman and the other fake Spark Dolls later reverted into his sketchbook once the effects of the cosmic radiation dried out. Cultural impact =Design basis= In the Ultra Series, Ultraman's main body has become the basis for most of the succeeding Ultra Warriors onwards. This design can be seen in certain Ultras such as Ultraman Jack (who was originally meant to be the returned original Ultraman), Ultraman Tiga, Ultraman Cosmos and others. =Parodies= Ultraman, as well as the elements from his own series, has been referenced and parodied numerous times in popular culture; examples include: *The South Park episode \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" features Leonard Maltin as Ultraman. *Episode 30 and 57 of Sgt. Frog features the , a spoon-themed object which turns its user into a giant, much like the Beta Capsule. When activated, the user rises in a similar manner to the Ultraman. *Episode 3 of Wooser's Hand-to-Mouth Life Phantasmagoric Arc has Wooser imagine himself fighting against Len who wears a monster costume while he wears a cap with Ultraman's fin-like head and performs the Specium Ray pose. *Manga artist Akira Toriyama is a fan of science fiction movies, as well as the Ultra Series' Ultraman and Ultra Seven. One of his manga, Dr. Slump features two minor characters, Nekotoraman and Nekotoraseven, on a theatrical poster pointed out by Senbei Norikami. Also, episode 1 of the manga's anime adaptation has a character themed after Ultraman, who pulls up the sun with his fishing rod. *Chapter 1 of My Hero Academia manga features Ultraman as a silhouettes of one of the many superheroes. *Episode 15 of OVA Patlabor: The New Files bears multiple parodies and tributes to the final episodes of Ultraman and Ultra Seven. The point of view character, Noa Izumi transforms into Ingraman (parodying Ultraman and Ultra Seven) and fights against Griffon (parodying Zetton) but loses to it and the Section 2 Division 2 members destroy it by themselves. In the end, Ingraman's bond with Noa was ended by Zero (parodying Zoffy) and Noa gains another life. *According to A Certain Magical Index's writer Kiyotaka Haimura, the design of Accelerator's shirt changes from being based on Devilman to the original Ultraman. This change is made during Volume 5 of the novel series to commemorate the character's change in sides, from antagonist to supporting protagonist. *In the Ben 10 franchise, one of Ben Tennyson's aliens, Way Big, was made from DNA sample from the To'kustar. Way Big resembles the original Ultraman in both size and appearance and his species' name is a play on the Tokusatsu genre as a whole. His Cosmic Ray attack is based on the Specium Ray. *Ultimate Girls has the main character Silk Koharuno and UFO-man fighting giant monsters in a similar manner to Ultraman. *Episode 93 of Gin Tama features Space Woman, a gigantic alien with a similar appearance to Ultraman. *The first episode of Concrete Revolutio has the superhuman of the week, Gross Augen as a giant hero fuse with Akira Shirota and fight against the S Planeterian. *Issue #67 of Marvel Comics' Exile has Morph changing his appearance into that of Ultraman. Issue #66-68 of that comic introduced the Science Squad, an attack team founded by the Curt Connors of Earth-3752, based on the SSSP from Ultraman. *Peyton Reed, the director of the Ant-Man films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said that Ant-Man's costume design was influenced by Ultraman, along with another tokusatsu superhero, Inframan. In other media The following below refers to Ultraman and Hayata's appearance outside of TV, such as manga and novel adaptations: =Films= CGI Ultraman as shown in the clip Ultraman_n/a. *On July 16, 2015, Tsuburaya Productions streamed a region-locked video on their official YouTube site titled as \\"Ultraman_n/a\\" without any description. Set in Shibuya, Tokyo, a giant monster emerges from underground and is quickly countered by Ultraman, before the fight concludes the video ends with the text \\"7.7\\", a reference to series creator Eiji Tsuburaya's birth date. This video received a lot of attention, mainly due to both Ultraman and the monster in question being rendered CGI models instead of suit actors. In the clip, Ultraman is shown opening his mouth, a feature which was originally planned for the Type A suit, but had to be scrapped. *In August 2019, a movie adaptation for the original Ultraman was announced, named as Shin Ultraman under the direction of Shinji Higuchi and writing of Hideaki Anno, both men previously cooperated for Toho's Shin Godzilla. The movie was slated to be released in 2021, as additional cast members were announced a month later. On December 15, during Tsuburaya Production's Tsubucon fan convention, the design of the titular Ultraman was unveiled, which takes the design cues from Tohl Narita's early impression of the character, lacking a Color Timer. =Manga=Ultraman is the main character of a popular manga series, Ultraman Chotoshi Gekiden. In the 1996 OVA, he is voiced by . *In the 2003 manga Ultraman THE FIRST (:ja:„Ç¶„É´„Éà„É©„Éû„É≥ THE FIRST) Ultraman and Hayata's role remain the same, as the manga is a reinterpretation of the TV series. However, additional plot elements were added, such as making the Alien Baltan the manga's main antagonist, who orchestrates almost every event in hopes of studying Ultraman's strength and weaknesses. In his final battle, Ultraman fought against Zetton (which was re-imagined as a colossal monster with knowledge of Ultraman's techniques) and was defeated by its overwhelming strength until the SSSP defeated it in a similar manner to the series. Ultraman was soon picked up by Zoffy, with Hayata being separated and given a new life. *In the 2005 manga Ultraman Story 0 (:ja:„Ç¶„É´„Éà„É©„Éû„É≥STORY 0), Ultraman is the first of his kind to be mutated into a giant after the Plasma Spark radiated their world. He is also the first one to face the Alien Baltan, the Ultra Warriors' enemies. *The 2011 Ultraman manga takes in an alternate timeline with Ultraman being the only Ultra Warrior to set foot on Earth. Several years after the giant left the Earth, Shin Hayata's (voiced by in Motion Comic) memory of Ultraman is completely erased and he has settled down and had a family, with a son named Shinjiro Hayata. Hayata also becomes the Minister of Defense after retiring from his service in the SSSP. Although Ultraman had long left, his fusion with Hayata left the man with his DNA, which gives Hayata superhuman abilities. 12 years prior to the story, he regains his full memory of Ultraman after watching footage of Bemular attacking an airplane, and the rest of the SSSP members had protected him from being test subjects. His son, Shinjiro inherits these powers and the father-son pair are enlisted into the reformed SSSP, whose new mission is to fight against rogue aliens. The Ultraman title lives within battle suits called , which were designed for combat, with Shinjiro taking one of the suits and inheriting his father's title as Ultraman. Other than the prototype and finalized product used by Shinjiro, two more Ultraman suits were made as the series progressed, one was called Ver. 7.1 (based on Ultra Seven) used by Dan Moroboshi and the non-SSSP manufactured suit, Ver. A. (based on Ultraman Ace), used by civilian Seiji Hokuto. In Chapter 70, he was actually revealed to have been disguised as Bemular, an antihero alien whose exo-suit bears the same technology as the Ultraman Suits. His true motive is unknown, aside from calling Shinjiro Hayata's inheritance of Ultraman's power a nuisance. =Novels=The novel adaptation of Ultraman, written by Tetsuo Kinjo in August 1967, Ultraman's role is historically the same as the TV series. Aside from that, the novel incorporates leftover plans from the series which never made it into the final cut, such as having Alien Mefilas form an alliance with past aliens, and having Geronimon revive Gomora and Red King instead of Draco and Telesdon (as was done in episode 37 (the U.S. dub of said episode, however, used the first two names, probably by mistake)). Another leftover plan that was incorporated into the story is also the scene where Ultraman died after his Color Timer was shattered by Zetton, which was omitted from the television series due to it being too violent for children. *Another Genesis, a novel series launched in 2012, has Ultraman's design drastically altered. Following the destruction of the Land of Light at the hands of Ultraman Belial, Ultraman fell into a deep seclusion and went mad, resolving to restore his destroyed home world by hunting shards of the fallen Plasma Spark. He first appeared in Chapter 2, facing off against a giant Antlar that mutated from the effects of a Plasma Spark shard. He emerges victorious and mercilessly stabs Antlar with the shard to death. He reappears in Chapter 9, having trailed Blast, the main protagonist of the novel (whose body was altered after a Plasma Spark shard was imbued to his heart) and had a short scuffle with him until he ripped of the shard from Blast's chest, simultaneously killing him. During that time, his image drastically changed to resemble Ultraman Belial. *Ultraman appeared during the climax of Ernest Cline's 2011 novel Ready Player One, during which the main character, Wade Owen Watts/Parzival, acquired the Beta Capsule and transformed into Ultraman to fight against Nolan Sorrento/IOI-655321, who piloted Mechagodzilla. In the 2018 film adaptation of the novel, director Steven Spielberg was unable to secure the rights to Ultraman and instead had both the Iron Giant and the RX-78-2 Gundam fulfilled the same role. *Ultraman appeared in Mountain Peanuts, an anthology series from Tatarajima Futatabi released in June 2019. Taking place a year before Ultraman Ginga S, Ultraman was transformed from his Spark Doll by Chigusa Kuno, who wished to defend the civilians in against Nosferu Lived by Android One-Zero. Their battle resulted with Nosferu defeated and Chigusa awakened in a crater. *Although he never appeared, Ultraman was mentioned in the 2016 novel Ultraman F, which is a non-canon story that took place one year after Ultraman leaves the Earth. Here, Hayata allowed himself to be experimented on in hopes of gathering secrets from what is left of Ultraman's remains. A child scientist named Soso (who would later become Dark Mephisto) revealed that Ultraman had three forms (which is largely based on his costume changes during his show's runtime), with each symbolizing Ultraman's battle specifications (Type A for strength, Type B for random techniques and Type C for long-ranged attacks). =Video games= Ultraman as featured in City Shrouded in Shadow. *In the game City Shrouded in Shadow, Ultraman appears in the first level, fighting against his impostor, Imitation Ultraman (later revealing the fake to be Alien Zarab). Their battle puts Ichi City in danger and sets the motion of the game, which involves the players (portrayed as civilians) trying to escape from the city as soon as possible while the giant battle turns into the largest obstacle they will ever face. He later appears in level 14, teaming up with Ultramen Taro and Zero against the evil Ultra, Belial. *Ultraman is featured as one of the playable characters in the app game Monster Strike as part of the collaboration with the Ultra Series. When the players used the \\"Strike Shot\\", Ultraman would initiate his strongest attack, the Specium Ray. =Stage shows=Ultraman Festival live stages *2016: Ultraman appeared during the climax of the first arc of the stageshow when the Ultra Warriors were having a hard time facing Zetton Alien Baltan. Ultraman debuted his newest attack, the , an attack from a winning entry in a Televi Magazine competition. He was voiced by . *2018: Takahiro Sakurai reprised his role, along with the Ultra himself performing a combination attack with Taro, as part of the entry made by the children. =Comics=Marvel Comics announced in November 2019 that they have partnered with Tsuburaya Productions to publish Ultraman comic books and graphic novels titled The Rise of Ultraman, which will begin to be released in 2020. The series aim to introduce Ultraman to new generation. Reception =Critical commentary= Todd Gilchrist of the IGN describes both Hayata and Ultraman as \\"a Peter Parker-style everyman becomes a superhero whenever alien monsters invade Earth, which conveniently occurs at least once every episode; subsequently, some fairly awkward fight scenes ensue, and the world eventually is saved from certain destruction.\\" He also said that among the reason of the series' popularity were either due to Hayata talking directly to the audience, the SSSP investigating cases, or Ultraman's battle with the monsters and aliens \\"whose girth is matched only by his ability to flail his arms and flash his eyes.\\" He gives the series the rating of 8 out of 10. While reviewing the complete DVD series of Ultraman, R. L. Shaffer (also from IGN) described Ultraman as \\"a giant, skyscraper-sized extraterrestrial being that protects us from equally gigantic monsters, aliens, dinosaurs and other nefarious foes. Each week, Ultraman faces off against fantastically fun villains, destroying towns, villages, forests and cities along the way.\\". Nevertheless, he admitted that the series \\"become a cult sensation, largely thanks to its monsters and dazzling battles\\" and gives a rating 8 out of 10. Bin Furuya, Ultraman's suit actor, has said that when he first wore the Ultraman suit, Eiji Tsuburaya had predicted that the show would create good memories for the children watching. Furuya trained for his role in Ultraman by practicing its beam techniques and \\"Shuwatch!\\" pose, inspired by \\"tap dancing and karate movements\\". As the Ultraman suit was very thin, he mentioned having received injuries in several ways during the set, so much so that Kurobe and Hiroko joked \\"of all the casts of Ultraman, he would be the first to go\\". When being asked what Ultra Warrior and Ultra Monster is his favorite, he answered the original Ultraman and Red King respectively, having enjoyed their fight scene in the show. His favorite episode of Ultraman is 23, which featured the appearance of Jamila, a monster who was mutated from an abandoned astronaut and tried to seek vengeance upon the government. Furuya mentioned that he genuinely cried while portraying Ultraman when he was forced to kill the monster. He also stated that although he liked playing the role of Ultraman, he enjoyed his time as Member Amagi for being able to expose his face. Furuya originally did not like acting as Ultraman, fearing that several scenes on set would bring harm to him, especially when recording scenes in water, which would enter his suit and he feared he would drown, but in the end, he grew more absorbed in his work and took a liking to it. Susumu Kurobe in circa 2016. According to Susumu Kurobe, during his time playing Hayata, he felt uncomfortable when wearing the SSSP uniform during shooting, especially when filming on location, but Hiroko Sakurai stated that she had no problem with it and even commented that the cast once went out to lunch while wearing the uniform. Despite his character Hayata and Ultraman being related, he never get a chance to perform together with Ultraman's suit actor Bin Furuya, as both recorded in their respective scenes (real life for Kurobe and special effects studio for Furuya). Kurobe himself has a daughter named , whom played Rena Yanase, the secondary protagonist of Ultraman Tiga. Initially, Kurobe prevented his daughter from acting in the series but eventually gave her his blessing to do so. They both appeared together in the film Superior Ultraman 8 Brothers, with their characters likewise written as father and daughter. He has joked that the decision to have Hayata and Fuji married in the movie was a \\"mistake\\", as it made his wife \\"jealous\\". When asked who is his favorite Ultraman, Kurobe answered that it was Ultraman Zero. His favorite Ultra Monsters were Pigmon, Alien Baltan and Woo. If possible, Kurobe, Hiroko and Furuya wish to believe that Ultraman will surpass their lifetimes and hopes that Tsuburaya Productions will keep putting Ultraman in any form of media for all audiences worldwide to enjoy. =Popularity= Shin Hayata trying to transform with a spoon before switching to the Beta Capsule. One of the most popular jokes in Japanese culture is the scene from episode 34 of Ultraman, which involves Hayata mistaking a curry spoon for the Beta Capsule while hastily trying to transform and stop the monster Skydon from falling down to Earth. This scene was devised by Akio Jissoji, and while receiving complaints from Samaji Nonagase, another Ultraman director, the episode's high viewer ratings justified the work. Because of this, certain Japanese media (mostly in anime and manga) tends to reference an in-joke to the incident either by repeating the same mistake or simply using a pair of spoons to replicate Ultraman's eyes. There is also a Mexican pro-wrestler Milo Ventura Ch√°vez, whose alias during matches is Ultraman. His son is named Ultraman Jr.. Although unrelated, another Mexican pro-wrestler Starman was previously known by the name Ultraman Jr. The defeat of Ultraman at the hands of Zetton in episode 39 of his series delivers a huge impact to the audiences, so much so that it served as inspirations for Japanese pro wrestlers Atsushi Onita and Akira Maeda in their career in hopes of \\"avenging the fallen hero\\". In February 2007, a popular internet video called Omoide wa Okkusenman! simultaneously aired in Japan and quickly become a sensation. The song describes the singer reminiscing about his childhood and friends, particularly pretending to be Ultraman and Ultra Seven with them, while realizing his life and theirs is nothing like what it used to be. In September of the same year, Ultraman was the important guest of the year's Hugo Award ceremony. His design is presented in the year's Hugo Award, sculpted by Takashi Kinoshita of the world-famous model and figure company Kaiyodo Co., Ltd (:ja:Êµ∑Ê¥ãÂ†Ç). Ultraman was also the one who presented Steven Moffat, writer of \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" from series two of Doctor Who with the Hugo Award. In 2006, a character popularity poll was launched in response to the 40th anniversary of the Ultra Series. Based on Oricon's list, Ultraman was placed first in the list in according to the total of voters. He is ranked first place in by female voters and second place by of male voters. Five years later on the Ultra Series' 45th anniversary, Ultraman was placed seventh in the popularity poll after losing to Zero, who scored the first place and ranked 11th in 2013 after losing to Ultraman Tiga. Ultraman's Ultra- Act figure participated in a 2015 April Fool's Day joke, where P-Bandai announced the \\"release\\" of a 40 m scale of Ultraman's figure (which is Ultraman's own size). This was only during shown on said day and never revealed again afterwards. =Merchandise= Ultraman Milky, a result of a joint collaboration between Ultraman (right) and Fujiya Co.'s mascot Peko-chan (left), cosplaying as Ultraman. Having gained a long time popularity, Ultraman has also been featured in several promotions and merchandises, either by Tsuburaya Productions itself or by extension, a cross-promotion. The first one was a set of action figure from the Ultraman line sold by Marusan toy company back in 1966, the same year the character and his series' debuted. Said toys were later displayed at the Yokohama Doll Museum on March 12 and 13, 2016 as part of the 50th anniversary of Ultra Series celebration . Tsuburaya has also collaborated with Fujiya Co. twice; once in the 1990s where a chocolate confectionery was released alongside an Ultraman card and later in 2016, a collaboration with Peko-chan, Fujiya Co.'s main mascot (from the milk confectionary Milky) as said company is celebrating its 65th anniversary, which served as a tie-in to the Ultra Series' 50th anniversary. Ultraman's soft vinyl doll had been sold several times by Bandai since the 1990s. In 2010, Ultraman was given his first release as a highly articulated action figure in the ULTRA-ACT toyline. Following his temporary corruption into Ultraman Dark in Ultraman Ginga, both he and Ultra Seven Dark were released in 2014 as repainted versions of their original figures. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Ultra Series, Ultraman got his second release in July 2016 as a poseable action figure in the S.H. Figuarts line alongside two of his iconic enemies, Alien Baltan and Zetton. In 2014, Ultraman and several of the Ultra Monsters from his series helped promote TOEIC to Japanese citizens, while being portrayed as a well-dressed businessman. A promotional video features him communicating with Dada while English subtitles are displayed. Ultraman helps the alien by giving him advise on how to start a business, but he confronts him after Dada's business plan turned out be an invasion of Earth. In the fashion world, Ultraman is also a part of the \\"A Man of Ultra\\", a branch of a fashion house with clothing themed after the Ultra Series. Ultraman himself had been present to promote the company's products, though sometimes the character is also accompanied by other characters of the Ultra Series such as Ultra Seven and Ultraman Ace. On November 2, 2015, a special violin painted with the attributes of the Ultraman series was presented in a concert at the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre Concert Hall and was sold to a lucky spectator at the price of 780,000 yen (US$6,428). In a cross-promotion with the FamilyMart convenience store franchise, Ultraman and Alien Baltan were sold as Chinese steamed buns designed with their likeness. This was however sold to a limited date, starting from January 19, 2016.

This compound adopts the perovskite structure. Synthesis Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 is not a naturally occurring mineral and several synthesis routes to obtain the compound have been developed. It can be easily prepared by solid state reaction between Na2CO3, Bi2O3 and TiO2 at temperatures around 850 ¬∞C. Structure The exact room-temperature crystal structure of sodium bismuth titanate has been a matter of debate for several years. Early studies in the 1960s using X-ray diffraction suggested Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 to adopt either a pseudo-cubic or a rhombohedral crystal structure. In 2010, based on the high-resolution single- crystal X-ray diffraction data, a monoclinic structure (space group Cc) was proposed. On heating, Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 transforms at 533 ¬± 5 K to a tetragonal structure (space group P4bm) and above 793 ¬± 5 K to cubic structure (space group Pmm). Physical properties Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 is a relaxor ferroelectric. Its optical band gap was reported to be in the 3.0‚Äì3.5 eV.

Palmer, was a French gynecologist and pioneer in gynecologic laparoscopy. Palmer was born in Paris. His parents, Fritjof Palmer and Signe, n√©e Garling, were from Gothenburg, Sweden. Palmer was trained as a gynecologist and became the head of the gynecological research at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris in 1934. His experiments with intra-abdominal endoscopy started during World War II in Paris, and in his work he was supported by his wife Elisabeth. Using initially a cystoscope he observed the female genital organs via the transabdominal and transvaginal approach and realized that the former required a controlled pneumoperitoneum during the procedure. He developed instruments for his procedures and established safe criteria for insufflation using CO2 in lieu of oxygen via the Veress needle. Use of the Trendelenburg position and mobilizing the uterus by a transvaginal cannula were introduced by Palmer. In his first report he described his experience with 250 ‚Äúcoelioscopies gynecologiques‚Äù using both the transabdominal and the transvaginal approach. Palmer noted the advantages of the transabdominal approach. In 1949, he described the regular rhythmic contractions of uterus felt as early as 6‚Äì8 weeks, now known as the \\"Palmer's Sign\\". Procedures were performed at Hospital Broca first under local anesthesia; in 1952 Palmer switched to general anesthesia. New illumination techniques using quartz rods became available in 1952 greatly improving the laparoscopic image. In 1961 Palmer was the first to retrieve a human oocyte from a patient via laparoscopy. In 1962 Palmer performed laparoscopic tubal coagulations and other interventions. Palmer and his wife traveled extensively teaching and influencing many gynecologists throughout the world about the use and potential of laparoscopy. Others came to visit them at their hospital in Paris. Laparoscopic pioneers influenced by Palmer include Melvin Cohen, Hans Frangenheim, Richard Fikentscher, Kurt Semm, and Patrick Steptoe.

With syntax inspired by the language Ruby, it is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded. Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm. Crystal is currently in active development. It is released as free and open-source software under the Apache License version 2.0.  History  Work on the language began in June 2011, with the purpose of creating a language with the elegance and productivity of Ruby and the speed, efficiency, and type safety of a compiled language. Initially named Joy, it was quickly renamed to Crystal. The Crystal compiler was first written in Ruby, but later rewritten in Crystal, thus becoming self-hosting, as of November 2013. The first official version was released in June 2014. In July 2016, Crystal joined the TIOBE index.  Description  Although resembling the Ruby language in syntax, Crystal compiles to much more efficient native code using an LLVM backend, at the cost of precluding the dynamic aspects of Ruby. However, the advanced global type inference used by the Crystal compiler, combined with the use of union types, gives Crystal the feel of a higher-level scripting language more so than many other comparable programming languages. Garbage collection is used, which is implemented using Boehm GC. Macros, generics, method overloading, and operator overloading are supported. Crystal's concurrency model is inspired by communicating sequential processes (CSP) and implements light-weight fibers and channels (for communicating between fibers) inspired by the language Go.  Examples  = Hello World = This is the simplest way to write the Hello World program in Crystal: puts \\"Hello World!\\" The same as in Ruby.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Longfellow house is located in a rural area of eastern Gorham, on the north side of Longfellow Road, opposite its junction with Dragonfly Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a gabled pediment. A single-story ell extends to the northeast. The house interior is laid out in a typical center-chimney plan, with the front parlors feature carved paneling on the walls, and the center stairway featuring finely carved newel posts and an elegant handrail. The house was built in 1761, and was purchased in 1775 by Stephen Longfellow after his Portland home was destroyed by British military forces in the Burning of Falmouth. His son, Stephen Jr., was trained as a lawyer, and was active in the town's civic affairs, and also served as a trustee of the Gorham Academy and Bowdoin College. It is known that a young Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was a visitor to what was then his grandfather's farm.

Since the beginning Helsinki-based Propaganda specialized in independent punk music and hardcore. The label dominated the Finnish hardcore punk and underground scene from the early 1980s until 1986. Releases were soon distributed in West Germany, Brazil and the United States. They soon began reissues in West Germany. Propaganda history The Finnish Propaganda Records was founded in the beginning of 1981 in Helsinki by Heikki Vilenius. The actual label logo Propaganda had already been created in the summer of 1979 for the Propaganda fanzine issues. Soon after the first releases the founder had a continuing radio program at Finnish Yle with name Suomirock. The name has become as an important part of meaning of Finnish rock within the later decades. Quite soon after 1the firstst Propaganda compilation album, Propaganda - Russia bombs Finland, in 1982 they announced co-operation with rockabilly shop Jensen Studio and Rockphone with a show at Lepakkoluola, the former addict flophouse, with a pile of performing bands. Rockphone traded Propaganda issues well and imported actual punk rock until The Lords of the New Church from London via aeroplane. Later Propaganda arranged several hardcore shows in the year by the same way. Puntala-rock 1983 was one of the same kind of festivals around Finland. The event has returned latest since 2000 and has always performers around the world. In the late 1982 album issues Valtion vankina (As Prisoner of State) from Riistetyt and Ei raha oo mun valuuttaa (Money Is Not My Currency) from Appendix were just what was needed to offer a total shot of Finnish hardcore. A small flat record Totaalinen Kaaos (Total Chaos] by Kaaos was enough for a while. Soon in 1983 the other hillbilly Herbert Egoldt from West German Rock-O-Rama Records was interested to reissue and issue a couple of dozen albums from Finnish Propaganda Records. If the reason began from Egoldt's rockabilly years with John Peel in Britain since the late 1960s or comment by John Peel, who wrote to Egoldt in May 1980: \\"One thing about the records. Why do German singers sing in English? Is it because it is fashionable? Or is it a marketing consideration? Whichever it is, I think they should sing in German anyway.\\"Same Old Song zine, No. 29, June 1980 Now those were singing in Finnish in West Germany and in Western Europe. That will make a lot of sense. The Bastards were among the first ones to tour in Europe. Since beginning of 1984 the albums were distributed by new company the German SPV GmbH to all of Western Europe. In the same time in 1983 Propaganda was already like hot stuff in Western countries as the American Maximum Rocknroll from San Francisco wrote reviews and articles. As the albums were at Top 10 lists on couple of dozens MRR radio stations all over United States including the university stations in many states. Later Terveet K√§det appeared on Maximum Rocknroll international punk and hardcore compilation album, Welcome to 1984. But as much earlier The Bastards reached appearing on World Class Punk compilation from ROIR with 1982 material. Propaganda was a moment earlier for a while a local company for Reachout International Records in Finland as Mykel Board was visited in Finland and made a promotion at Finnish broadcasting company Yle. Mykel Board was as well a columnist from Maximum Rocknroll, but his own home district was at New York City like for his own company Seidboard International and for Neil Cooper (ROIR). In 1984 changed Riistetyt and The Holy Dolls were the first ones to tour around the United States from the east coast to the west coast with 30 gigs. They played at Los Angeles during 1984 Summer Olympics with Dead Kennedys at Olympic Hall, Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. Italian Raw Power was the other band with the Riistetyt during the tour. The Brazilian punks were very keen on that foreign material, fashion stuff and bands. Later Terveet K√§det was reissued there. It took until 2001 as Riistetyt toured in Brazil for the first time. Since then there have been a lot of large tours around Brazil. In the late 1980s Propaganda made more Suomirock, melodic rock, blues rock and made the incoming of Finnish hard rock. The next century Since 1993 have been many reissues on many labels and a pile of new bands performing with various music genres. Propaganda fanzine Propaganda magazine, fanzine started in Finland in early 1979 and was in the beginning issued from H√§me. Later in 1980 it was located in northern Helsinki. A dozen of different zines have been reissued with reissued vinyl records past the last two decades in Germany and Finland. During a couple of last years in Helsinki founded Oranssi ry. has made an archive concerning around 300 fanzine issues from Finland and including yet some Propaganda issues.

Costa was born into a powerful dynasty, with both Catholic and Brahmin roots, which had supported Portugal's Regeneration and also supported the extension of constitutional and democratic rights to Portuguese India. Costa studied law, but alongside his legal career developed a profile as a journalist and short-story writer. Costa's uncle Bernardo Francisco da Costa owned the weekly journal O Ultramar, associated with the Partido Ultramarino and Goa's Brahmin caste.Paul Melo e Castro (trans.), Lengthening Shadows, 2 vols (Salig√£o: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 13-14. Costa began writing for O Ultramar in 1882, most famously contributing the novel Jacob e Dulce ('Jacob and Dulce') in serial form between 10 November 1894 and 1 June 1895, prior to publishing the work as a book in 1896. It is set in a thinly disguised version of Costa's home town, Marg√£o, and focuses its satire on the Catholic bourgeoisie of the Velhas Conquistas of Goa. 'Rather than a novel, Jacob e Dulce is perhaps best read as a series of sketches pushed forward narratively by the machinations surrounding an arranged marriage' between its eponymous protagonists. Influenced by the writing of the Portuguese satiric realist E√ßa de Queiroz, Jacob e Dulce is noted for moving Goan writing beyond Romanticism towards Social realism, developing social sature, and capturing a colloquial and local tone in the Portguguese dialogue.Paul Melo e Castro (trans.), Lengthening Shadows, 2 vols (Salig√£o: Goa, 1556, 2016), I pp. 14-15, 17-18 (quoting p. 14). It has run to several editions.Gip, Jacob e Dulce: scenas da vida indiana (Marg√£o: Typographia do Ultramar, 1896); Francisco Jo√£o da Costa, Jacob e Dulce: scenas da vida Indiana, 2nd edn pref. by Visconde de Tauney (Nova Goa: Casa Luso- Francesa, 1907); Francisco Jo√£o da Costa, Jacob e Dulce, 3rd edn pref. by Jeremias Xavier de Carvalho (Goa: Tipografia Sadananda, 1974). It appears that the opprobrium which Costa's satires provoked led him to cease fiction-writing after Dulce e Dulce.Paul Melo e Castro (trans.), Lengthening Shadows, 2 vols (Salig√£o: Goa, 1556, 2016), I p. 21.

Background The use of cigarettes, where tobacco is rolled in thin paper, was imported to France from Spain by French soldiers of the army of occupation, particularly after the 1823 expedition of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis. Cigarette paper factories were built in the Pyrenees region, including Perpignan. Jean Bardou (1799‚Äì1852) was originally a baker, and later became a painter and draftsman. His eldest son Joseph (1823‚Äì84) learned the art of making cigarette papers from a manufacturer in Urgel. Jean Bardou decided to enter the business, and in 1849 was documented as a \\"fancy paper manufacturer\\". On 3 September 1849 he received a 15-year patent for manufacture of Job cigarette papers. The JOB brand was formed by the founder's initials separated by a diamond representing Perpignan, J‚ô¶B. This at once began to be spoken as \\"JOB\\". The small operation was based on the upper floors of a house rented by Jean Bardou on the rue du Bastion St Dominique, at first using paper from another manufacturer. Bardou's children Pierre (1826‚Äì92), Marie (1821‚Äì98) and Magdeleine Bardou (1829‚Äì1907) and four other workers undertook paper cutting and packaging into booklets using paper manufactured in Castres. The packages of rolling paper gave a time-saving alternative to the smoker who would otherwise cut his own paper from a sheet, and were advertised as being hygienic and healthful. Manufacturer Skylight of the \\"H√¥tel de l‚ÄôIndustrie du Papier a Cigarette Jean Bardou died in 1852. The JOB brand was auctioned in August 1853 and bought for 16,000 francs by Pierre Bardou. His brother Joseph Bardou had formed a separate company making \\"le Nil\\" cigarette papers, with a laughing elephant as its logo. In January 1854 Pierre began making his own paper in Perpignan. A range of flavored papers included licorice, anise, vanilla, juniper, camphor and so on. Careful attention to marketing included development of premium or luxury papers, with attractive boxes designed for ladies. Moulasse paper plant At the end of 1858 Bardou bought a large house at 18 rue St Sauveur in Perpignan (now the Rue Zola) for 40,000 francs, originally an apartment building, which he divided into one area for manufacturing and another for his residence. Pierre had a glass skylight installed in his \\"H√¥tel de l‚ÄôIndustrie du Papier a Cigarette\\" factory for illumination. It was used for manufacture from 1861 to 1879, and employed 80 workers in 1861. In 1865‚Äì66 a workshop was installed for lithography and printing. Around 1872‚Äì75 the Moulasse paper plant was opened on the Salat, a tributary of the Ari√®ge, registered under the names of Pierre Bardou and Leon Pauilhac. A second building was acquired at 13 St Sauveur, then additional buildings until an entire block was occupied, with the manufacturing process becoming increasingly automated, driven by steam power. By 1889 the Job company employed 290 women and 40 men. Pierre and his brother Joseph both employed excellent graphic artists, including Jane Atch√© of Toulouse and the Czech Alphonse Mucha, to create advertising material. Ch√¢teau d'Aubiry. built for Joseph Bardou Wealthy bourgeois In 1857 Pierre Bardou married L√©onie Amiel, daughter of a Perpignan confectioner, who brought no dowry. He bestowed 12,000 francs on her in case of his death. By the early 1860s Bardou had transformed his house on the rue Saint-Sauveur into a mansion with luxury furniture and valuable artworks. He owned a growing number of properties in the town and the countryside. Pierre's wife, L√©onie Amiel, died in 1871 leaving three children. His sister-in-law, Henriette Amiel, moved into the mansion on 18 rue Saint-Sauveur in Perpignan to care for them. Pierre Bardou was an avid collector of exotic and unusual objects. An 1871 inventory of the mansion at 18 rue St Sauveur listed 669 items of furniture and decoration. The private area had twelve main rooms arranged around a courtyard above which was a gallery, There were two dining rooms on the ground floor, two libraries and a chapel upstairs. The house held an eclectic collection of paintings, statues, bronzes, ivories, enamels and weapons. In 1877 Pierre's private assets were valued at an estimated 413,300 francs. In 1878 by presidential decree Bardou changed his name to Bardou-Job, an unusual example of the creator adopting the name of the brand rather than the reverse. His eldest daughter, Camille (1858‚Äì1934), married Charles Ducup de Saint-Paul, a senor officer. His son, Justin (1860‚Äì1930), married the daughter of a business lawyer. In 1888 Jules Pams married his youngest daughter Jeanne (1868‚Äì1918). Pams was an attorney and municipal councilor in Perpignan with a family fortune earned from maritime trade. While Pierre Bardou was an enthusiastic collector of \\"curiosities\\", Jules Pams was an enlightened amateur and patron of contemporary art, and in effect became Bardou's artistic adviser. Jeanne and Jules Pams moved into the H√¥tel de l'Industrie, which became known as the H√¥tel Pams, and no longer included manufacturing. Pierre continued to live in the mansion. In 1889 Pierre brought back to Perpignan part of the \\"Chinese pavilion\\" from the Exposition Universelle of that year. It was reassembled on the Promenade des Platanes for the 1890 Perpignan Industrial Exhibition. He provided more than 400 items for the exhibition's Fine Arts pavilion, including liturgical furniture, antique weapons, Egyptian and Roman antiquities, Louis XV and Louis XVI furniture, paintings and sculptures. Bardou commissioned the Danish architect Viggo Theodor Dorph-Petersen to design a chateau for each of his children. These buildings were completed after his death. Joseph was given the Ch√¢teau d'Aubiry (1894‚Äì1900) in C√©ret, Camille was given the Ch√¢teau Ducup St Paul (1892‚Äì1910) in Perpignan and Jeanne was given the Ch√¢teau de Valmy (1888‚Äì1906) in Argel√®s-sur-Mer. Legacy Pierre Bardou-Job died in Perpignan on 24 February 1892 at the age of 65. He died intestate, but his property was divided easily between his children. Jules Pams commissioned the architect Leopold Carlier to transform the mansion on rue St Sauveur, which Jeanne had inherited, into a lavishly decorated example of Belle Epoque taste. The Job brand had an estimated value of 1.2 million francs in 1892, and was held jointly by his heirs. They formed the Pierre Bardou-Job company, owned by Justin Bardou-Job, Charles Ducup de St Paul and Jules Pams, with headquarters on the rue Saint-Sauveur in Perpignan. Although there were some labor disputes, the company was generally paternalistic and gave good working conditions, in the spirit of Pierre Bardou-Job.

However, the Indians moniker would be used for decades by Cheyenne amateur and semi-professional teams.http://wyomuseum.state.wy.us/pdf/baseball.pdf The first minor league Cheyenne Indians became members of the short‚Äìlived Rocky Mountain League in 1912. The Rocky Mountain League evolved from a semi‚Äìprofessional league and lasted only the 1912 season, permanently folding as a minor league on July 5, 1912. Playing in the four‚Äìteam 1912 league, the Pueblo, Colorado franchise moved to Trinidad, Colorado on June 8, 1912. Trinidad then moved to Cheyenne on June 28, 1912, becoming the Cheyenne Indians.

Description and history The Samuel Gilbert Smith Farmstead is located in a rural area of northern Brattleboro, on the east side of Orchard Street. The property now consists of , although the farm originally associated with the property was in the 18th century. The farmstead sits on land that has open fields lined with stone walls, original 19th-century wells, and a partially lined streambed that passes through the property. The farmstead has a main house block, to which are connected a kitchen ell, equipment shed, and barn. All of these elements date to about 1870, and have vernacular style. The house is 1-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof and a pair of gabled wall dormers. The farm's origins date to 1767, when Dr. Henry Wells was granted 1000 acres on what was then known as Meeting House Hill. His acreage provided some of the earliest civic parcels in Brattleboro, including its first cemetery, town common, and meeting house site. The town's economic development, however, took place along its streams and rivers, and the area soon declined in importance. From 1801 to 1815, the farm (then about ) was owned by Royall Tyler, an early American playwright and Vermont jurist, who left a detailed description of the property from that time, when it had an older detached farm complex. In 1850 half of the farm passed to Samuel Gilbert Smith, who c. 1870 tore down the old farmstead and built the present connected one.

MacArthur Fellowship In its 2015 announcement, the MacArthur Foundation said that she had been given the 625,000 prize for \\"deploying her considerable prowess in languages, social history, and papyrology\\", and that Rustow is \\"rewriting our understanding of medieval Jewish life and transforming the historical study of the Fatimid empire\\". Rustow said that \\"The award is going to permit me to work in a way that I haven't really been able to work before,\\" and \\"to dig a little bit deeper\\". Academic research Chushiel ben Elchanan found in the Cairo geniza Ben Ezra Synagogue, original location of the Cairo geniza In her 2008 book Heresy and the Politics of Community: The Jews of the Fatimid Caliphate, Rustow challenged conventional wisdom about the relationships between two rival Jewish communities living under the Fatimid Caliphate from 909 to 1171 C.E. They were the mainstream Rabbanites and the Karaites, who reject the authority of the Talmud and rely only on the Hebrew Bible. Most previous historians had described them as \\"factions bitterly divided by theological difference, the latter branded as heretics and marginalized.\\" Rustow studied everyday documents that were part of a massive archive at the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Old Cairo. These documents, such as contracts, letters and government decrees and petitions, showed \\"a wealth of social, economic, and political transactions between the two groups\\". Her book calls into question \\"the depth of the religious schism, suggesting a higher level of tolerance and cooperation than had been assumed\\". Previous scholars of documents found in the Cairo geniza had concentrated on texts written in Hebrew and Aramaic. Rustow chose to study those written in Arabic, which often appear \\"in the margins and on the backs of such documents.\\" Her studies with colleagues have led to insights about the everyday lives of the Jews of Cairo, such as that they \\"imported sheep cheese from Sicily‚Äîit was deemed kosher‚Äîand filled containers at the bazaar with warm food in an early version of takeout.\\" There was a triangular Mediterranean trade route between Egypt, Tunisia and Sicily in the 11th century, and flax used to make linen fabric, and soap, were the main commodities. \\"Everyone wore linen all the time,\\" according to Rustow. She is studying the usage of the Arabic language by the Jews of Sicily in years following the expulsion of Muslims¬∑from Sicily in the 13th century C.E. The Muslims had previously ruled Sicily from the 9th century to the 11th century. In collaboration with Sacha Stern, she has also done research on the Jewish calendar, focusing on the 10th century C.E. dispute between Jewish authorities Aaron ben Me√Ør and Saadia Gaon about the calendar.

The bridge and its extension, the Stapenhill Viaduct, link Burton upon Trent town centre to the suburb of Stapenhill half a mile away on the other side of the river. The bridge is a \\"semi-suspension\\" bridge, of which this is the first and only one of its kind in Europe to be built to this design.A.O.F. Guide to Burton-on-Trent, 1911, p.13 It was designed and constructed by a local firm, Thornewill and Warham. It is a three-span footbridge totalling in length. The chains were made of flat bar iron, and are continuous from one end of the bridge to the other. They are riveted to the ends of the main girders, not anchored at a distance as they would normally be on a traditional suspension design. The bridge is made of wrought iron and cast iron, and is Grade II listed. The bridge was built to replace a small ferry service that had operated at the same site since the 13th century. The Ferry Bridge was gifted to the town by brewing magnate Michael Arthur Bass, later Lord Burton. It was officially opened on Wednesday 3 April 1889, and the ceremony was attended by between 8,000 and 10,000 people. The bridge has remained in use by hundreds of people every day, apart from during two renovations, most recently in 2015‚Äì2016. The bridge carries National Cycle Route 63 between Stapenhill and Burton town centre. Background In the 19th century the brewing industry in Burton and hence the population of the town expanded greatly. As a result, pedestrians often had to wait a considerable time for the ferry. Two boats were needed at peak times. The clamour for a second bridge over the Trent grew. In 1865, the Marquis of Anglesey, who owned the rights for the ferry, obtained an Act of Parliament authorising him to build and maintain a bridge over the River Trent. The bridge was intended to carry all traffic and to be as good as or better than the old Burton Bridge, at that time the only bridge across the river in Burton. Plans were drawn up but never implemented. In 1885 the Marquis sought parliamentary approval to build a smaller footbridge over the River Trent near the site of the Stapenhill ferry and to sell the ferry rights to Burton Corporation. After long negotiations between the council and the Marquis, Burton brewery owner Sir Michael Arthur Bass, (later Lord Burton, whose wife was Harriet Georgina n√©e Thornewillhttp://www.thepeerage.com/p2839.htm) offered to have a footbridge built at his own expense, as long as the council bought the ferry rights from the Marquis. The Council agreed to pay the Marquis the then huge sum of ¬£12,950 for the rights. Work started in 1888. Bridge builders Ferry bridge, after restoration in 2016 Thornewill and Warham Ltd, an engineering company in Burton, was selected to design and build the bridge. The business was founded by iron merchant Thomas Thornewill (born 1691) and his son Francis in 1740; located in Burton's New Street, it made spades and other edged tools. It remained largely focused on hardware manufacture until the 1840s. In 1849, Robert Thornewill (grandson of Thomas) entered into a partnership with John Robson Warham, an engineer from South Shields, and the firm became Thornewill and Warham. By 1862 they were making colliery winding engines,Victoria County History of Staffordshire, Vol.II, p. 150 steam engines and locomotives, and within a decade were supplying steam engines to Scotland, London and South Wales.\\"Burton upon Trent: The Development of Industry\\" by C.C. Owen, Phillimore & Co., 1978, p. 120 Apart from the manufacture of steam engines, the company was also notable for its construction engineering; they provided and installed much of the ironwork in the Burton breweries between 1850 and 1890.\\"The Noted Breweries of Great Britain and Ireland\\", A. Barnard, 1889, Vol. 1 pp. 409 The construction in 1889 of the Ferry Bridge and the connecting viaduct to Bond End, at a total cost of just over ¬£10,000, was one of the firm's major achievements in that field. Bridge design The bridge was designed by Edward William Ives (1851‚Äì1914?), supported by Alfred Andrew Langley, chief engineer of the Midland Railway. It is a suspension design, its distinctive feature being that the chains are not anchored at a distance to independent anchorages as they would normally be on a traditional suspension bridge, but are riveted to the ends of the main girders. These chains are made of flat iron bars riveted together, and continuous from one end to the other. This form of construction had not been previously used in bridge construction and the Ferry Bridge was the first bridge in Europe to be built to this specification, and is possibly the only one remaining. The bridge spans the river in three sections, supported by four cast iron piers each in diameter. The piers were placed in pairs from centre to centre and were sunk to a depth of between twelve and fifteen feet (3.66‚Äì4.57 metres) below the marl and sandstone river bed. The pier cylinders were filled with solid concrete and on top of this there was of non-porous engineering blue bricks cemented together. Finally, to complete the foundation, there was an ashlar stone bed onto which they were erected. The centre span of the bridge is long and the two symmetric end sections each measure . The bridge footway is wide and stands above the average water level at the centre and above at each end. The towers, each of which stands high, when first built were cased externally with ornamental cast-iron work and the bases were panelled and decorated with the arms and supporters of Lord Burton, together with his motto ‚Äì ‚ÄòBasis Virtutum Constantia‚Äô (The basis of virtue is constancy). The towers were surmounted with lions rampant each of which carried a wrought iron staff with gilded copper vanes and Lord Burton's monogram. The towers are high, of wrought-iron lattice work at the bottom, tapering to at the top. They were braced together at the top by a lattice girder deep. The girders are continuous from one end of the bridge to the other. The chains are made of flat bars thick, riveted to the main girders in the middle of the centre span and at the ends of the bridge. The piers and towers are placed outside the main girders, which increases the resistance of the bridge to wind pressure, the distance between the chains being wider at the tower than at the middle and ends of the girders; the hangers are inclined both along and across the bridge. The suspension \\"cables\\" were made from flat wrought iron plates riveted together to give a \\"cable\\" wide by thick. The lattice girders which tie the towers together are cased with more ornamental iron work bearing the date of the erection of the bridge, 1889 and underneath the ironwork appears the inscription ‚ÄòThe gift of Michael Arthur First Baron Burton‚Äô. The bridge was tested by loading the middle section of the bridge with several tons of old rails and its rigidity was further tested by 20 men from the Staffordshire regiment marching in synchronised double time across the bridge. This latter test was considered, in 1889, to be the most severe test to which a suspension bridge could be exposed. The footway was originally of red deal (Pinus sylvestris/European Redwood), higher in the middle than at the sides to ensure water runoff. The bridge was lit by six lamps in total, two Victorian lamps hanging from each of the cross braces between the towers with heavy cast iron lamp pillars in character, and four more similar lamps affixed to the towers at the ends of the bridge. The total weight of the iron work of the bridge is over 200 tons (203 tonnes). At both ends of the bridge span the stone substructure on which the superstructure rests was built by Messrs Lowe and Sons, and the carving of the patterns was executed by Mr Hilton of Victoria Street, Burton. Official opening The bridge had its grand opening on Wednesday 3 April 1889, an event attended by between 8,000 and 10,000 people, despite the wet and stormy weather. A photograph shows, in the front row, Mrs Harrison, Sir Michael Arthur Bass (later Lord Burton), Nellie Bass with Misses Kathleen and Violet Thornewill, daughters of the builder, Mr C. Harrison (Mayor) and Lady Bass. Following the official opening, Bass announced plans to erect a raised causeway across the meadows join the Ferry Bridge to Burton. A letter dated 9 April 1889 confirmed his proposal; erection of an 81-span iron viaduct, the 'Stapenhill Viaduct, began soon after and it was presented to the town in 1890. This elevated the total cost of the bridge from around ¬£7,000 to ¬£10,000. Today, the viaduct has modern steel decking on the original cast iron columns. The total cost of the structure and viaduct, including acquiring the river-crossing monopoly from the Marquis of Anglesey, was in the region of ¬£20,000. Initially, tolls were collected to help recoup costs, but Lord Burton terminated these charges in April 1898. Renovations =1970s renovation= In 1969, the Burton Mail reported that the bridge was in a \\"serious condition\\" after 80 years. There was a suggestion that the council (which now owned the bridge) should dismantle it and that a new one be built at a cost of ¬£60,000. Instead, specialists were called in to examine the whole structure. They concluded that the ornamental features and ironwork (described by the borough surveyor of the time as dead weight) were too heavy, were causing excessive stress to the structure, and should be removed. This was done. The council agreed to renovate the bridge, which was then enshrouded in scaffolding for nearly a year. When this was removed there was public disappointment that the bridge had lost all its embellishments, and that the previous colour scheme of gardenia and plum had been replaced by black and white. Local newspapers reported on the 'Rape of the Ferry Bridge'. Two of the original cast iron lions and one of the plaques which had stood on the piers to the bridge are now (2016) on display at the National Brewery Centre in Burton. A few other items removed in 1969 (lamps, etc.) can be found in the gardens and homes of local residents who saved them from the scrapyards. Following efforts by Burton Civic Society, on 22 June 1979, the bridge was Grade II listed by English Heritage. =2015‚Äì2016 renovation= In the mid- to late-2000s Burton Civic Society became aware that the bridge structure was deteriorating dramatically and brought this to the attention of both the local East Staffordshire Borough Council (ESBC) and to Staffordshire County Council (SCC), as responsibility for the bridge had passed from ESBC to SCC. Quotations and estimates were obtained for the refurbishment, and for the renovation and replacement of the embellishments that had been removed. However, the overall cost was prohibitive. There was much public concern that, if left to deteriorate further, the demolition of the bridge and its replacement with a modern structure was again a possibility. Lobbying by the Burton Civic Society continued, and by 2014 ‚Äì when the bridge celebrated its 125th anniversary ‚Äì the SCC acknowledged that work on the bridge was imperative. A campaign to restore the bridge was started by a social media group called \\"Friends of the Ferry Bridge\\", which had over 400 active members. SCC set up a Working Group to discuss the refurbishment of the bridge with representatives from ESBC, the Environment Agency, Historic England, Burton Civic Society and from the Friends of the Ferry Bridge. The majority of the refurbishment suggestions made by SCC were immediately accepted by the Group and a planning application for the required works was granted by ESBC. The Friends of the Ferry Bridge were asked to help choose the colours, and chose to maintain the main bridge in black and white with the rosettes or quatrefoils painted with red centres. The local population were advised from June 2015 of the closure of the footbridge which, 126 years since its opening, continued to be the major link between Stapenhill and the town centre. Work on the refurbishment started on 7 September 2015 and was due to be completed in about a year, at a cost of around ¬£1 million, and project managed by Amey. The work was hindered by some severe weather conditions, high river levels, gales etc. which affected the ability to carry out the work safely. Due to the extent of the work being undertaken, the bridge was closed, with traffic diverted over the nearby St Peter's Road Bridge. The refurbishment also resulted in a rare cancellation of the Burton Regatta. The bridge finally reopened on 21 October 2016. Plaque replacement In 1969, prior to the first refurbishment, four heavy cast iron plaques had been removed from the bridge's four piers. Each was four feet square, featured the arms of the bridge's benefactor Lord Burton, and were had been painted in full colour. Burton Civic Society wanted these to be replaced during the 2015‚Äì2016 refurbishment, but after extensive searches the plaques were not found to be in the Council's possession. However, one plaque was found on display at the Museum of Brewing in Burton, and it was established that this could be used to create moulds for lightweight aluminium replacement plaques, but they would have to be made and installed while the contractor's scaffolding was still in place. Local businessman and Civic Society member George Lawson, who had a keen interest in the bridge as past chairman of Burton Leander Rowing Club and Burton Regatta, approached local aluminium casting company Alpac Alloys who were able to confirm that a new mould could be made from the original. To remove the original plaque by crane from the museum wall, make a mould from it, cast four new plaques in aluminium, paint them in the original colours, and install them on the bridge was estimated to cost ¬£17,400. With no time to organise fundraising, Lawson took on the plaques' production management and paid for them to be made, and they were finished in time for installation while the scaffolding remained. Lawson subsequently organised a fundraising programme in the town and the cost figure of ¬£17,400 was quickly reached. Awards The Friends of Ferry Bridge community action group played a major role in pushing forward the restoration project. On 4 November 2016, at the annual \\"Impact on the Community Awards\\" ceremony of the Trent and Dove Housing Association held at the Pirelli Stadium, this Group won the \\"Best Community Project\\" Award, presented by Sally Gunnell OBE.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1244082225642171&set;=a.113825282001210.15925.100001212165273&type;=3&theater; On 3 November 2016 at Edgbaston stadium, the Midland Counties region of the Institution of Structural Engineers presented the Ferry Bridge with its award in the Pedestrian Bridge category. Love locks Within a few days of the re- opening, a love lock was affixed to the bridge, but it was quickly removed, as such items are unsightly, a hazard, add to the load on the structure, and are not allowed under the Listing Regulations. Any that do get affixed will be removed at once.

It is a successor of the highly popular CZ 452 rifles, and is chambered for the .22 LR (1:16\\" twist rate), .22 WMR (1:16\\" twist) and .17 HMR (1:9\\" twist) calibers. The CZ 455 is produced with new manufacturing technology capable of closer tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation.Tabor, Tom, Report From the Field: New Rifles, CZ-USA, Gun Digest (2012) p. 203 All CZ 455s have hammer-forged, hand-lapped steel barrels, a trigger that is adjustable for weight of pull, and the capability to interchange barrels in different contours and calibers by simply removing two set screws from the receiver. Design and operation Instead of the barrel being threaded into the receiver, as found on the CZ 452, all CZ 455 models use twin set-screws to fix the barrel in the frame as part of an interchangeable barrel system.CZ-USA Press Release - Kansas City, 17 Dec 2009: \\"The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of their rifle.\\" http://cz-usa.com/press-release/cz-455-american/ Additionally, actions can be swapped into any 455 stock without modifications. All versions feature a milled 11 mm dovetail rail atop the receiver for the mounting of optical or telescopic sights. History First introduced in 2010, the CZ 455 was designed to replace the CZ 452 series which is being phased out of current production. The CZ 452 first appeared in 1954 as the Model 2 (ZKM 452), and was a refinement of the CZ Model 1 (ZKM-451) .22-calibre rimfire bolt-action training rifle that first appeared in 1947. ZKM is an acronym for Zbrojovka- Kouck√Ω-Malor√°≈æka, the rifle's manufacturer ([ƒåesk√°] Zbrojovka), designer (Josef Kouck√Ω) and Malor√°≈æka - for rimfire rifle).Zve≈ôejnƒõno 29.4.2010, Kalend√°rium: 29. dubna 1969 ‚Äì Poƒç√°tek Unik√°tn√≠ ƒçesk√© zbranƒõ CZ 75, vlo≈æil admin, www.svornost.comFencl, Ji≈ô√≠, Zbra≈àa≈ôi par excellence - Brat≈ôi Josef a Franti≈°ek Kouƒçt√≠ (2. d√≠l), http://www.valka.cz, 31 Jan. 2015 The Model 1 or ZKM-451 was developed on the request of the occupying German authority in 1943-44, when very few rifles were built as fully stocked Mauser 98k-type trainers. The receivers of these early .22 training rifles were marked tgf (Tschechische Gewehr Fabrik - German for Czech Rifle Factory) by the German Heereswaffenamt. Because of wartime requirements for combat weapons, assembly and production was halted on all .22 training rifles, leaving a large stockpile of parts and receivers at war's end. After the war, these parts (some of which still have the tgf code) were used along with new barrels and stocks to make the Model 1.

It occurred to her that American democracy had a repository of words with \\"the power to hearten men and move them to action.\\" The original program notes state,\\" Our documents are our legends - our poignantly near history - our folk tales.\\" The notes also include the quotations from historical documents and figures that are spoken throughout the performance. The text is excerpted from The Declaration of Independence, Song of Songs, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address, the Emancipation Proclamation and the writings, speeches or sermons of Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Paine, John Wise, Francis Fergusson and Red Jacket, the Seneca orator.Dance Libretto, American Document, by Martha Graham,Theatre Arts Monthly, September 1942 Both setDance Gives Historic Significance, New York World Telegram, October 10, 1938 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200154057/pageturner.html and costumes subtly used a red, white and blue motif.Maureen Needham Costonis, Martha Graham's American Document: A Minstrel Show in Modern Dance Dress, American Music, Vol. 9, No. 3, University of Illinois Press, Autumn 1991, p. The ballet is patterned after a minstrel show, although Graham was careful to avoid degrading racial stereotypes. Green's original music was scored for piano and drums. It borrowed from American and African folk tunes and incorporated the fanfares and drum rolls characteristic of minstrel shows. The characters and structure are also derived from minstrelsy. The roles are: *The Actor as Interlocutor *The End Figures *The Chorus - a dance group and leader *Two Principals The Interlocutor introduces the show and addresses the audience directly, reading excerpts from the chosen documents. Although unnamed, the End Figures are the equivalent of Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones, minstrel show characters who traditionally interact with the Interlocutor in \\"Cross-Fire.\\" The chorus also is a feature of the theatrical form. At the first performance, Graham and Erick Hawkins danced the roles of Two Principals, May O'Donnell and Jane Dudley played the End Figures, and Sophie Maslow led the chorus. Actor Houseley Stevens, Jr. appeared in the role of Interlocutor.Owen Burke, An American Document, New Masses, October 18, 1938 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200154058/pageturner.html  Structure  The action takes place in six sequences, an entrance and five \\"episodes:\\" *Entrance: Walk Around; Cross-Fire *First Episode: Declaration *Second Episode: Occupation *Third Episode: The Puritan *Fourth Episode: Emancipation *Fifth Episode: The After Piece-Cross Fire-Cakewalk (1938), renamed Hold Your Hold! (1942) = Entrance = In the opening scene, the company struts and cakewalks, a dance also known as the walk-around. They bow to one other and to the audience, gathering in a semi-circle at the rear of the stage in conventional minstrel show fashion. Once all of the performers are present, the Interlocutor introduces the action.Susan Manning, Modern Dance, Negro Dance: Race in Motion, University of Minnesota Press, p. 136 \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening. This is a theater. The place is here in the United States of America. The time is now-tonight.\\" Each of the subsequent episodes is introduced by the Interlocutor; each concludes with a walk-around that ends in an empty stage. = Declaration = The first episode begins with the Interlocutor asking, \\"An American-What is an American?\\" The End Figures enter, running diagonally across the stage accompanied by a drum roll. They cross three times, then stop as the Interlocutor recites from the Declaration of Independence. As he speaks, the chorus members enter singly, slowly walking to positions in a line downstage. After a Dance of Declaration, featuring the chorus leader and male principal, all performers leave the stage. = Occupation = The second episode celebrates the country's Native American heritage. As the Interlocutor crosses from stage right to left, he asks, \\"America-What is America?\\" The sequence features a solemn solo, Native Figure, for the female principal accompanied by texts from Fergusson and Graham. An all-female ensemble then performs Lament to the Land with spoken words excerpted from a letter by Red Jacket mourning the native peoples' loss of country. = The Puritan = The scene's narration begins in similar fashion to the first episode with the Interlocutor querying, \\"An American-What is an American?\\" The focus of the sequence is a duet for the principals, ostensibly meant to show the conflict between the Puritan wish to lead \\"a simple life or an angry life of denial.\\" While the narration weaves the sensual Song of Songs with a fiery sermon from Puritan pastor Jonathan Edwards, the choreography tells a tale of unrepressed passion. = Emancipation = The fourth episode begins as a dance for the entire ensemble and concludes in a duet for the principals. The section begins with the Interlocutor onstage alone, \\"The United States of America-What is it?\\" The spoken word excerpts are taken from the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, and Graham's own writings. As described in the program notes, the ensemble dance and duet are \\"ecstatic.\\" The company ends the episode with outstretched arms and upturned faces. = Hold Your Hold! = The fifth episode, originally named the After Piece, later renamed Hold Your Hold!, brings the audience up to the present day. From 1938 through 1944, the Interlocutor introduced the piece by proclaiming the current year. Three women, speaking as \\"three million women\\" intone a \\"lament for the living.\\" One man, a surrogate for \\"one million men,\\" voices his hopes and fears. A Dance of Invocation brings the performance to a climax as the Interlocutor speaks, \\"America! Name me the word that is courage. America! Name me the word that is justice. America! Name me the word that is power. America! Name me the word that is freedom. America! Name me the word that is faith. Here is that word - Democracy!\\" The company exits with the exception of the Principals, who stand on opposite sides of the stage as the Interlocutor recites the famous words from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address \\"That government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.\\" The company enters in a final walk-around. The Interlocutor bids the audience goodnight.  Post-premiere changes  Graham frequently altered her work after their initial debuts.Stuart Hodes, Part Real, Part Dream: Dancing with Martha Graham, Concord ePress, 3rd edition, August 2011, location 2067 She modified the choreography of American Document from 1938 through 1944, years in which the country had also seen many changes. Bits of text were also added or deleted, although it is not clear in exactly what ways. = 1989 Version = Graham overhauled American Document in 1989 with almost all new choreography, revised narration and minimization of the minstrel show aspect. The world premiere of the work featured two guest artists, Mikhail Baryshnikov, as the male principal, and Cecilia Peck, as the Interlocutor. Baryshnikov danced the Native Figure solo, a dance Graham made for herself, in the Occupation episode. The new American Document also included men in the previously all-female chorus. New narrative passages included quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy. = 2010 Version = In 2010, director Anne Bogart and playwright Charles L. Mee reinvented American Document for 21st century audiences. Though not one of Martha Graham's dances, the work is closely tied to the original and poses the same question, \\"What is an American?\\" Bogart and Mee's American Document was staged for six SITI Company actors and ten Graham dancers. The dance/theater piece incorporated text from such sources as the free verse of Walt Whitman, the spontaneous prose of Jack Kerouac and the blog posts of American soldiers stationed in Iraq.Political Dance Project, Martha Graham Dance Company, http://marthagraham.org/the-martha-graham-dance-company/current- projects/#political  Critical reception  Following the premiere and Carnegie Hall performance that occurred shortly after, American Document was called \\"a moving testimonial to the greatest of American traditions- democracy.\\" Another critic gushed, \\"If there is any American who can witness Martha Graham's new dance composition American Document without emerging from the experience a finer prouder citizen, that person is impervious to reason, numb to emotion, insensible to art.\\"Viola Hegyi Swisher, Dancers Lauded for Universality, Citizen News, (Hollywood, California), March 11, 1939 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200154104/pageturner.html Some notices were more nuanced, praising the work for its honesty in pointing out the bad as well as the good in the American experience.Gervaise Butler, American Document Re-reviewed, The Dance Observer, November 1938 http://lcweb2.loc.gov/natlib/ihas/service/graham.1/200154015/200154015.pdf Reviewers noted the premiere marked the first appearance of a male dancer with the Graham company. Erick Hawkins performed courtesy of Ballet Caravan, a precursor of the New York City Ballet. Critics praised the inclusion of Hawkins and favorably reviewed his efforts, although many noted he came from a ballet tradition rather than one of modern dance. His duets with Graham were especially well received. From its 1938 debut through 1944, as Graham made changes to the ballet, the notices became less complimentary. New York Herald Tribune critic Edwin Denby pronounced a 1944 version \\"a complete failure,\\" adding that the work originally seemed to show America's history \\"as much for its disgraces as for its strengths. At present it seems intended merely as a smug glorification.\\"Edwin Denby, The Dance, The New York Herald Tribune, May 12, 1944 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200153456/pageturner.html American Document is now recognized as one of the most important works of Graham's Americana period, a phase that includes American Provincials (1934), Frontier (1935), Panorama (1935), Horizons (1936), El Penitente (1940), Letter to the World (1940), Salem Shore (1943) and Appalachian Spring (1944).Helen Thomas Dance, Modernity, and Culture: Explorations in the Sociology of Dance, Psychology Press, 1995 p. 115 = 1989 Reviews = Reviews of the 1989 version, for the most part, were not favorable. The dance was called \\"disassociated\\", \\"pretentious\\" \\"gibberish\\" in which the words did not illuminate the choreography and vice versa.Marcia B.

Advertised in 2015 with the tagline \\"The Movie You Will Never See\\", it is due to be released on November 18, 2115. The 100-year span matches the time it takes for a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac to be properly aged before its release to consumers. The film stars an international ensemble, with American actor John Malkovich, Taiwanese actress Shuya Chang, and Chilean actor Marko Zaror. 100 Years will apparently be a short film, Rodriguez having stated in a 2019 interview with French YouTuber InThePanda: \\"I was making several short films for them, and I finished that one first, we shot that one first, I thought that was gonna be a commercial or something. And then I showed them the movie and they said 'Yeah, that's great, that's great. That's the one we lock away.' And I said 'What? That's the one you lock away? What about the other one with the future' 'No, that's the commercial.' [...] The one that I was most attached to was the one they locked away.\\" Premise The plot is a closely held secret, which is not expected to be revealed until the film itself is released in November 2115. However, teasers suggest it will either be sci-fi themed, nature themed or retro and will involve a hero, a heroine, and a male villain. Cast While the details of the film have been kept highly secret, the names and roles of three actors have been released: * John Malkovich as the male protagonist. * Shuya Chang as the female protagonist. * Marko Zaror as the antagonist. Production Malkovich and Rodriguez announced in November 2015 that they had teamed with Louis XIII Cognac, owned by R√©my Martin, to create a film inspired by the hundred years it takes to make a bottle of Louis XIII. Although the film's plot remains a complete secret, on November 18, 2015, Malkovich and Rodriguez released three teaser trailers: Retro, Nature, and Future. Release Pending release, the film is being kept in a high-tech safe behind bulletproof glass that will open automatically on November 18, 2115, the day of the film's premiere. One thousand guests from around the world, including Malkovich and Rodriguez, have received a pair of invitation tickets made of metal for the premiere, which they can hand down to their descendants. The safe in which 100 Years is kept was showcased at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and various other cities before being returned to Cognac, France and the Louis XIII cellars. Related A song \\"100 Years\\", composed by Pharrell Williams in collaboration with Louis XIII, will be released in November 2117.

Career =Politics= Bouldin was briefly a member of a Tea Party group in Texas, but she left that group when she realized they did not share her values. Bouldin's ideals led her to become a Free State Project participant and move to New Hampshire. As a freshman representative, she introduced two bills addressing increasing heroin use in New Hampshire. HB 270 provided legal protection against arrest and prosecution for individuals calling for medical assistance for someone with an opiate-related medical problem. HB 271 relaxed restrictions on prescribing naloxone, granting authorized health care professionals the power to write a prescription for anyone at risk of an opiate overdose or for a person who knows someone at risk of an opiate overdose. The bills were passed by the legislature, signed by the governor, and became key planks of the state's response. In December 2015, Bouldin commented on Facebook that a proposed change in New Hampshire's public nudity law that would have allowed men to expose their nipples in public while prohibiting women from exposing their breasts while not breastfeeding was sexist.

It was founded in 2010 by Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman, who discovered the bracelets while on a vacation in Costa Rica. After a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the product, interest increased, and the company has since sold over 2 million bracelets. Pura Vida partners with a number of charities, producing bracelets in those charities' colors and donating a portion of those bracelets' sale prices back towards the partner charities. About The company, which is based in La Jolla, California, was founded by Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman in 2010. Thall and Goodman traveled to Costa Rica together on vacation after graduating from San Diego State University, where they met a pair of bracelet makers named Joaquin and Jorge. They then purchased 400 bracelets for $100 to bring back to the United States. The pair initially sold their original stock at Planet Blue, a small boutique located in Malibu, California. After a number of celebrities - including reality television personality Lauren Conrad, soccer player David Beckham, and musicians Rihanna and Skrillex - were seen with the bracelets, Pura Vida saw an increase in web traffic and sales. By late 2013, Pura Vida had grown to a dozen US-based staff and 50 Costa Rica-based staff. By the end of 2015, the number of Costa Rica-based employees had doubled to over 100. As of March 2015, Pura Vida moved 125,000 bracelets a month through 3,400 physical retail outlets and through their website. As of February 2015, over two million bracelets have been sold. As of July 2019, the company has over 650 employees that work to create these bracelets. Pura Vida means \\"pure life\\" in Spanish; in Costa Rica it is said frequently and has many meanings, such as hello, goodbye, or even to say thank you. In an interview, Thall and Goodman called the term \\"the slogan of Costa Rica, just like the word 'aloha' from Hawaii\\". The company initially began with the original 9-string bracelet model and later expanded their product line with the addition of different style bracelets. These bracelets include braided styles, charm bracelets, and bead bracelets. Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman explained that the charms on their products represent waves and mountains because they allude to the Pura Vida lifestyle. Pura Vida Bracelets can be found on many social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. As of April 2020, the company's Instagram account has over 1.9 million followers. Pura Vida also creates bracelets for charitable organizations, as a cause marketing fundraiser; bracelets are produced in a charitable organization's colors, and a portion of the sale of those bracelets goes to that charitable organization. As of March 2019, over $1.7 million has been donated to charitable organizations; over 174 charities have been the beneficiaries of this program. In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Pura Vida sold a memorial bracelet and was able to provide $30,000 to the memorial fund. In addition to producing its own line of products, Pura Vida produces bracelets for the MyIntent Project. Other charities Pura Vida Bracelet's has partnered with include: The American Heart Association, Shatterproof, UNICEF, charity:water, The Surfrider Foundation, Peach's Neat Feet, and many others listed on their website.In 2019, Vera Bradley purchased a 75% stakeholder share in Pura Vida‚Äôs parent company, Creative Genius.

After retiring from a career in the private sector, Tan began volunteering with the Archdiocesan Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ACMI), which she chaired. She left ACMI after it declined to support some of Tan's initiatives, and in 2004 she founded HOME, which provides services for and advocates on behalf of migrant workers. That same year she founded a sister organization in Indonesia, Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita (Indonesian for World Foundation For Women). For her work, Tan has been honored by the Asia Society, the United States Department of State, and the governments of Thailand and The Philippines. Background Bridget Tan was born in 1948, the third of four children. Her father was a doctor and her mother was a homemaker. Tan attended CHIJ Katong Convent, a Catholic girls' school. Tan worked in human resources in the private sector until her retirement at age 55. Tan has twin children - a son who is a doctor and a daughter who is a psychologist - and six grandchildren. Advocacy In 1998, Tan helped found the Roman Catholic Archdiocesan Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ACMI). She joined the initiative at the request of a Catholic priest, Father Andy Altamirano; he approached Tan about the initiative in 1997, and died shortly after the commission was founded. Tan became the initiative's chair, a volunteer position. In a 2011 interview, Tan expressed that she \\"felt the call of God\\" when Father Altamirano asked for her to become involved in the commission. With ACMI, Tan set up food, shelter, and training programs. Tan later left the ACMI due to the Church's refusal to support its programs. Tan founded the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) in 2004, using her own personal funds. The organization provides temporary room and board, medical, legal, and financial assistance, and job skills training to migrant workers that have been abused or exploited by their employers or by the agents that recruit migrant workers. Since its founding, the organization has expanded its focus, and now also works to support victims of the sex trade and to combat human trafficking. The organization also engages in advocacy efforts. Tan worked for HOME without pay until 2012, at which point the paid role of Chief Executive Officer was created, and Tan assumed the role. In 2004 Tan also founded Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita (Indonesian for World Foundation For Women), a women's shelter in Sekupang, Batam, Indonesia. HOME's website lists Yayasan Dunia Viva Wanita as its \\"cross border partner\\", and the organizations collaborated in 2012 on a survey of sex workers in Batam. For her advocacy work, Tan received a Hero Acting to End Modern-Day Slavery Award from then United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a June 2011 ceremony surrounding the release of the United States Department of State's 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report. She was also mentioned in Secretary of State Clinton's presentation, where Tan's work with the ACMI was highlighted.

The cemetery opened in 1906 on what was previously woodland in a rural area of Surrey. Originally, only half the site was given over for burials while the other half was maintained as a nursery before it was converted in the 1930s and the whole site was renamed East Sheen Cemetery. It is today contiguous with Richmond Cemetery, though the original boundary is marked by a hedge. The cemetery's chapel is used for services by both sites, as Richmond Cemetery's chapel is no longer in use as such. The chapel was built in 1906 in the Gothic revival style by local architect Reginald Rowell, who was himself later buried in the cemetery. Many prominent people are buried in the cemetery, which contains several significant memorials. The most important monument in the cemetery is the memorial to George William Lancaster and his wife by Sydney March‚Äîa bronze sculpture of an angel weeping over a stone sarcophagus dating from the 1920s, which is considered to be one of the most important sculptures of its type from the 20th century. Also significant are the memorial to Markham Buxton, a bronze relief on a stone stele by his son Alfred; a miniature walled garden commemorating Edouard Espinosa and his wife Eve Louise Kelland; and several other sculptures, both Christian-themed and secular. The cemetery also contains over 70 war graves, cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. History and setting The cemetery, which is on a 16-acre (6.5-hectare) site, was first opened as Barnes Cemetery in 1905 or 1906, prior to which the area was woodland. The land in the area was historically owned by King George III. Only the northern half of the site was originally for burials, with the southern half used as a nursery. The southern area was converted into a cemetery in the 1930s and the whole site was renamed East Sheen Cemetery. It was originally administered by the Municipal Borough of Barnes, with the adjacent Richmond Cemetery being administered by the Municipal Borough of Richmond (Surrey). Since 1965, when both boroughs joined the Municipal Borough of Twickenham to form the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the two cemeteries have been administered by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. The entrance to the cemetery is set back from the road along an avenue flanked by trees and behind a pair of brick gate piers; an entrance described at resembling the entrance to a country house. An air-raid shelter was built near the entrance during the Second World War. Although East Sheen and Richmond cemeteries are today contiguous, the original boundary is still clearly visible and is marked by a holly hedge. The cemetery contains a chapel, which is used for services by both East Sheen and Richmond cemeteries, as the latter's is no longer in use; the chapel is available for people of all faiths and beliefs. It was designed by Reginald Rowell, a local architect who was buried in the cemetery upon his death. The chapel, which is listed Grade II by Historic England, was constructed in 1906, but was designed in the 13th-century Gothic style with a slender fl√®che. East Sheen Cemetery enjoys protected status as a result of designation as Metropolitan Open Land and (jointly with Richmond Cemetery and Pesthouse Common) as a conservation area. Memorials East Sheen Cemetery contains several particularly noticeable memorials, the best-known of which is the Lancaster Memorial, dedicated to George William Lancaster and his wife Elisa Mary Lancaster who died in 1920 and 1922 respectively. Originally from the north of England, the Lancasters were industrialists who made their fortune in coal mining. The memorial is described by historian Hugh Meller as \\"arguably the most dramatic sculpture in any of London's cemeteries\\", eclipsing all other monuments in the cemetery. The Lancaster Memorial was designated a grade II* listed building in 1992, and according to Historic England is \\"considered one of the most significant 20th-century examples of funerary sculpture\\". It consists of a bronze sculpture of an angel mourning over a rectangular sarcophagus, which rests on a coved base and a rectangular plinth, all of which are constructed of Portland stone. The fluidity of the figure and the drooping of the angel's wings over the sarcophagus are singled out by Historic England as particularly memorable features. The angel was sculpted by Sydney March, who was later renowned for the National War Memorial of Canada‚Äîalso consisting of bronze and stone sculpture. The work is thought to be inspired by funerary sculptures by Leonardo Bistolfi in northern Italy. Also listed (at grade II) is the memorial to Markham Buxton (1852‚Äì1927), a bronze relief on a stone stele; the memorial was built by Buxton's son, Alfred Buxton, a sculptor who exhibited at the Royal Academy. The stele is of granite construction, topped with five antefixae and standing on a granite base, which bears an inscription. The relief features a woman in classical dress playing a lyre; it is inscribed with the verse \\"OUR SWEETEST SONGS ARE THOSE WHICH TELL OF SADDEST THOUGHTS\\". Alfred exhibited a relief by the name of \\"Chanson Triste\\" at the Royal Academy in 1927, which is likely to be the same work that features on his father's grave. Other significant memorials in the cemetery include a marble sculpture of a soldier commemorating William Rennie O'Mahony (d. 1928), a silver-painted wooden dolphin,a glass circular disc memorial and a sculpture of Jesus as the Good Shepherd and three lambs, and a mosaic of St Francis and Mary Magdalene on an illegible headstone. Secular memorials include a carving of an aircraft on the grave of Royal Air Force Pilot Officer Denis Power (d. 1931), a maritime-themed memorial on the Hervey grave (1917), and a miniature walled garden commemorating Louise Espinosa and her husband Edouard. The cemetery contains a war memorial to 79 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the two world wars, 71 of whom have individual headstones‚Äî33 from the First World War and 38 from the Second World War. The graves are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

Early life  Little is known of Costin's upbringing. His enslaved mother was Ann Dandridge- Costin, and her father is reputed to have been Col. John Dandridge of Williamsburg, Virginia, making her the half-sister of Martha Washington. Ann Dandridge-Costin was said to be of African and Cherokee descent. Native American slavery had ended and she should have been free under Virginia law via her maternal ancestry, but the slave colony put priority on African ancestry. While Ann and several of her children lived at the Mount Vernon plantation owned by George Washington on the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia, there is no evidence her son William lived there. He may have lived nearby with other family. Costin's legal status as \\"free\\" or \\"enslaved\\" is debated by historians, as is the identity of his father.  Career  Around 1800, Costin moved from Mount Vernon to Washington City, what later became known as Washington, D.C. About that time, he married Philadelphia \\"Delphy\\" Judge, whom Martha Washington had given to her granddaughter Elizabeth Parke Custis Law as a wedding present in 1796. She and her children were manumitted in 1807 by Thomas Law, Elizabeth's husband. (see below). In 1812, Costin built a house on A Street South on Capitol Hill. There he and his wife Delphy raised a large family. From 1818, Costin worked as a porter of the Bank of Washington. He worked to save his money and buy properties in the developing capital. In 1818, Costin helped start a school for African-American children, which his daughter, Louisa Parke Costin (c. 1804-October 31, 1831), eventually led. It was known as the first public school for black children in the city. In the August 1835 Snow Riot, when a white mob burned abolitionist institutions and those associated with free blacks, it spared the school. In addition to the school, Costin created other organizations. In 1821, he helped found the Israel Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, led by an African- American minister.Cromwell, John W. (1917). The First Negro Churches in the District of Columbia, 64-106, at 68 (Lancaster, Pa.; Washington, D. C.; The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, Inc.); and published in the Journal of Negro History 7, no.1 (January 1922), 64-106 (\\"Among the men and women active in the first efforts were Scipio Beans, George Simms, Peter Schureman, George Hicks, Dora Bowen, William Costin, William Datcher, William Warren and George Bell, one of the three colored men who fifteen years before had erected a building for a Negro school.\\") In June 1825, Costin co-founded an African-American masonic lodge known as Social Lodge #1 (originally #7)Miller, Randall M., and John David Smith (1997). of Afro-American Slavery (Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group), (Costin served as the third Worshipful Master of this lodge, dying while still in office.), at 265 (\\"Beside churches and schools, free Negroes associated with one another in various ways....The Prince Hall Freemasons (named after the founder of black freemasonry in America) attracted members notable for their economic achievements‚ÄîAbsalom Jones and James Forten of Philadelphia, William Wormley and William C. Costin of Washington, D.C.\\") In December 1825, he helped found the Columbian Harmony Society, providing burial benefits and a cemetery for use by African Americans. Working with nearly the same group with whom he started other organizations, including fellow hack driver William Wormley (ca. 1800-1855) and educator George Bell (1761‚Äì1843), Costin served as the Society's vice president through 1826.Sluby, Sr., Paul E., and Stanton Lawrence Wormley (2001).

Legal challenge  William Cranch, Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia (circa between 1844 and 1860) = Challenge to Surety Bond Law = In 1821, Costin challenged the part of a Black Code restricting African Americans in the District. It was an effort by the administration of Mayor Samuel Nicholas Smallwood to dissuade free blacks from settling there. The law required that free persons of color had > to appear before the mayor with documents signed by three 'respectable' > white inhabitants of their neighborhood vouching for their good character > and means of subsistence. If the evidence was satisfactory to the mayor, the > individuals were to post a yearly $20 bond with a 'good and respectable' > white person as assurance of their 'good, sober and orderly conduct,' and to > ensure that they would not become public charges or beggars in the streets. > to post an annual twenty dollar cash bond and present three references from > white neighbors, purportedly to guarantee their peaceful behavior.\\"An Early > Civil Rights Victory in a D.C. Court\\", Historical Society of the District of > Columbia Circuit Costin refused to comply, and was fined five dollars by a justice of the peace. He appealed his fine to the court. In the case, Chief Justice William Cranch accepted that the City charter authorized it \\"to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which free Negroes and mulattoes may reside in the city.\\" (He was a nephew of second U.S. President John Adams). Costin asked the court to strike the law entirely, saying that Congress could not delegate powers to the city that were unconstitutional, and that \\"the Constitution knows no distinction of color.\\" Cranch defended the peace-bond law by pointing to certain barriers in the state voting and jury laws of the time, writing: > It is said that the constitution gives equal rights to all the citizens of > the United States, in the several states. But that clause of the > constitution does not prohibit any state from denying to some of its > citizens some of the political rights enjoyed by others. In all the states > certain qualifications are necessary to the right of suffrage; the right to > serve on juries, and the right to hold certain offices; and in most of the > states the absence of the African color is among those qualifications. But Cranch conceded that the law was unfair to free blacks who had long lived in the city and contributed to it, noting that they could not compel whites to give surety, and that the law threatened to force families apart. He ruled that those who had lived in the District prior to the law's enactment were exempted from having to abide by it. He said, \\"It would seem to be unreasonable to suppose that Congress intended to give the [city] corporation the power to banish those free persons of color who had been guilty of no crime.\\"  Personal life  =Marriage= Gen. George Washington and his family. (Geo. Washington Parke Custis, Gen.

According to Virginia estate law, the dower slaves passed to the Custis children upon Martha's death. In 1807 and 1820, Costin purchased the freedom of seven relatives.

Bullseye shooting is a category of shooting sport disciplines where the objective is to score points by hitting a round shooting target as close to the center as possible with slow precision fire. The name refers to the center of the target, \\"the bull's-eye\\". In Scandinavia this type of shooting competition is referred to as Range- Shooting (Danish: baneskydning,Danish: DGI Skydning: Skyttebogen  Ultimativ guide til regler Norwegian: baneskyting.Norwegian: baneskyting med rifle ‚Äì Store norske leksikon Swedish: banskytteSwedish: Banskytte gev√§r f√∂rklarat  Sandvikens Skyttegille). A large emphasis is put on accuracy and precision through steady breath, sight picture and trigger control, and fixed and relatively long time limits give competitors time to concentrate for a perfect shot. An example of bullseye shooting competitions is the ISSF pistol and rifle events, but there are also many other national and international disciplines which can be classified as bullseye shooting, e.g., NRA Precision Pistol competitions in the United States. Matches are normally held at permanent shooting ranges where the competitors are lined up beside each other and shoot during the same predetermined time period at their own stationary targets which are placed at the same fixed distances from match to match. Distances in bullseye shooting disciplines are typically given in round numbers such as 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 meters, depending on firearm type and discipline. During competition, the line consisting of shooters is called the firing line, while the line consisting of targets is called the target line. Due to its simple format, bullseye shooting is often recommended for beginners in shooting sports in order to learn the general fundamentals of marksmanship. Bullseye shooting is a part of the olympics, and considerable training is needed to achieve a high level of proficiency.  Examples of bullseye disciplines  = Rifle disciplines = The 10-ring bullseye target used for the ISSF 300 meter rifle disciplines. Bullseye shooting with rifles can refer to several disciplines: * ISSF 10 meter air rifle is an air rifle discipline shot with 4.5 mm (0.177 in) caliber air rifles. * Small-bore shooting competitions are a set of several disciplines usually shot at distances of 10, 15 or 50 meters, usually only for small-bore rifles in .22 LR caliber.  ISSF 50 meter rifle prone  ISSF 50 meter rifle three positions  National Norwegian Small-Bore competitions (miniatyrgev√¶r or innend√∏rsskyting) are shot at 15 meters by both the Norwegian Shooting Association and the National Rifle Association of Norway, but at different target sizes. * Fullbore rifle shooting usually refers to disciplines where one uses intermediate (such as .223 Remington or 6mm BR) or battle rifle cartridges (such as the .308 Winchester or the .30-06 Springfield) which comparably are larger and more powerful cartridges than the small-bore .22 LR cartridge.  ISSF 300 meter standard rifle  ISSF 300 meter rifle prone  ISSF 300 meter rifle three positions  ICFRA Palma and F-Class, and various national fullbore target rifle disciplines in Commonwealth nations.  High power rifle, a fullbore rifle discipline arranged in the United States by the National Rifle Association of America.  Nordic Bullseye Rifle-Shooting (Danish: baneskydning, Norwegian: baneskyting, Swedish: banskytte) is fired at 100, 200 and 300 meters depending on class, and either with the small-bore .22 LR cartridge at 100 meters, or fullbore calibers at distances 100, 200 or 300 meters. Matches are usually held in the summer season, and are arranged by the National Rifle Association of Norway (DFS), the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI Shooting) and the Swedish Shooting Sport Association (SvSF). = Handgun disciplines = Bullseye shooting with handguns can refer to several disciplines: * Airgun:  ISSF 10 meter air pistol is an air pistol discipline shot with 4.5 mm (0.177 in) caliber air pistols. * Small-caliber (.22 LR):  ISSF 25 meter pistol  ISSF 25 meter standard pistol  ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol  ISSF 50 meter pistol * Large-caliber:  ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol allows many centerfire cartridges, but the most popular one is the .32 S&W; Long.  Comparing to other shooting disciplines  While many shooting sport disciplines share the same fundamental characteristics, bullseye competitions can be set apart from other disciplines in many ways. * In Clay pigeon shooting target scoring isn't graduated by rings or \\"scoring areas\\", but rather scored either a hit or miss. * Long range shooting competitions puts a larger emphasis on knowledge and application of ballistics in different weather conditions, mostly to compensate for wind drift on longer ranges. Rifle shooting disciplines with distances beyond 300 meters are often distinctively referred to as long range shooting, even though some of these disciplines also fulfill all the characteristics of the bullseye shooting disciplines which however are shot at shorter distances. Among long range disciplines are the ICFRA Palma and F-Class competitions, where competitors shoot from the same line, at fixed target ranges between 300 and 900 meters (or 300 to 1,000 yards) during the same predetermined time period. However, disciplines referred to as long range shooting differ from those simply referred to as bullseye in that external ballistics is of much larger importance. * Speed shooting competitions, which puts a large emphasis on time since a course must be shot with the most points in the shortest amount of time. * Field-shooting or terrain-shooting (Danish: terr√¶nskydning,Danish: Aalborg Skyttekreds af 1862 - Terr√¶nskydning Norwegian: feltskyting,Norwegian: feltskyting ‚Äì Store norske leksikonNorwegian: Litt om feltskyting ‚Äì Haugesund Pistolklubb (English: A little about field shooting - Haugesund Pistol Club) Swedish: f√§ltskytteSwedish: Svenska Pistolskyttef√∂rbundet-Om pistolskytte- F√§ltskjutningSwedish: F√§ltskytte gev√§r f√∂rklarat  Sandvikens Skyttegille) differ in that they usually are shot from temporary shooting ranges in the terrain at varying distances, rather than permanent shooting ranges at fixed distances. * Other disciplines differ for instance in that targets are moving (such as in running target shooting), or that the competitors shoots one and one at a time (such as in clay pigeon shooting and practical shooting sports).

The house is listed as having special architectural interest in Sweden (byggnadsminne). Architects Bengt Edman and Lennart Holm designed it as the residence of Pharmacia head Elis G√∂th. The building has significance in international architectural history as the believed source of the term brutalism. L√§nsstyrelsen i Uppland om Byggnadsminnet Villa G√∂th Villa G√∂th, which has two floors and a basement, is built in dark brick. The windows are plain but form partial rows in the fa√ßade. The visible I beams over the window sections in the front and rear of the building are an example of how the choice of materials is openly displayed in the house. The roof is a flat gable roof. On the interior, the floor plan is open, and materials are consistently made visible in a straightforward way. In the ceilings, the tongue-and-groove pattern of the boards used to build the forms for the poured concrete is visible. Several interior walls are of the same dark brick as the exterior. The bathrooms on the first floor are formed of raw concrete (b√©ton brut) in the form of Alvar Aalto‚Äôs famous Aalto Vase. Centrally located in the house is the open stairway that connects the floors.Printout from Arkitektmuseet's picture bank (id 199030)Printout from Arkitektmuseet's picture bank (id 199028)External and internal photos from 1952 by Sune Sundahl  Villa G√∂th and Brutalism  The term brutalism was made popular when the British architectural critic Reyner Banham used it in 1966 in his book, The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? to characterize a new group of architectural trends, specifically in Europe. It is believed to have originated in the expression ‚Äúnybrutalism‚Äù (new brutalism) coined in 1950 by the Swedish architect Hans Asplund in a facetious comment about Villa G√∂th. The expression was spread by British colleagues visiting Sweden and adopted by younger architects in the UK. In a letter from Hans Asplund to the editor of the Architectural Review, published in August 1956, Asplund describes how he first used the term. The letter is reproduced in Reyner Banham‚Äôs New Brutalism. New brutalism is not only an architectural style; it is also an approach to architecture, a striving to create simple, honest, and functional buildings by, for example, not allowing them to create associations or emotions. Stylistically, brutalism, with its strict, modernistic design language, is said to be a reaction to the architecture of the 1940s, much of which was characterized by a retrospective nostalgia. Brutalism is an expression often used derogatorily to denote large-scaleness, insensibility, and the use of raw materials. Villa G√∂th may make a severe, aloof impression, but it is at the same time a simple and carefully prepared building with great architectonic qualities. This well-preserved and culturally interesting house was listed as historically significant by the Uppsala county administrative board on March 3, 1995.

It subordinated Navarre to Aragon and defined their boundary. It was effective for five months, but in May it was unilaterally abrogated by Navarre. When Alfonso the Battler, the king of Aragon and Navarre, died in September 1134, separate claimants arose for his two kingdoms. His own will specified that both kingdoms should pass to the military orders, but it was disregarded in the succession crisis. In Aragon, Alfonso's younger brother, Ramiro, a childless monk was elected king by the nobility. In Navarre, Garc√≠a, a scion of the old Navarrese branch of the ruling house, was elected in an effort to restore Navarre's independence. The old Muslim kingdom of Zaragoza, which Alfonso had conquered, was occupied by Castile. The Pact of Vadoluengo was negotiated and signed on behalf of the king of Aragon by Fort√∫n Garc√©s Cajal, Pedro de Atar√©s and Ferriz de Huesca, and on behalf of the king of Navarre by Ladr√≥n √ç√±iguez, Guillermo Azn√°rez de Oteiza and Jimeno Azn√°rez de Torres. They agreed that the border would be the same as that of 1035, when Sancho III of Navarre set up Aragon as a separate kingdom. Four disputed locations‚ÄîAlasues, Cadreita, Roncal and Valtierra‚Äîwere assigned to Garc√≠a, who was to perform homage to Ramiro for them. The pact referred to Ramiro as the \\"father\\" (pater) and Garc√≠a as the \\"son\\" (filius), language that indicated not only the latter's subordinate status but probably also his status as heir to the childless and unmarried ex-monk. Following the signing, Ramiro went to Pamplona, where he was received as king in a ceremony. Thereafter, while the pact was in effect, Aragonese charters usually name him as king in Pamplona with Garc√≠a ruling under him. The usual form in Ramiro's own charters was label Garc√≠a as ruling \\"under my hand\\" (sub manu mea) or \\"under my empire\\" (sub meum imperium). Navarrese charters are more circumspect, usually naming Ramiro and Garc√≠a as kings without specifying their relationship. Shortly after 5 May, Garc√≠a abandoned the Pact of Vadoluengo. He met Alfonso VII of Le√≥n, probably in the vicinity of N√°jera, and agreed to become his vassal for Navarre.

She is the founder and head of Tenazas Design. Her work includes projects for the Henry Art Gallery, Rizzoli International, San Francisco International Airport, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Symphony, the Stanford University Art Museum, and the University of California, Berkeley. Tenazas is Associate Dean and Henry Wolf Professor in the School of Art, Media and Technology (AMT) at Parsons The New School for Design in New York. Biography Tenazas was born December 17, 1953 in the Philippines and raised in Manila. As a child, she won national painting contests. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the College of the Holy Spirit Manila. In the mid-1970s, her aunt in Michigan offered to pay for postgraduate tuition in the United States. Unable to find a closer school to her aunt and misunderstanding the country's geography, she enrolled at the California College of Arts and Crafts (now CCA), and moved to San Francisco in 1979. While visiting her aunt in Michigan in December 1979, she stopped by Cranbrook Academy of Art to show Katherine McCoy her portfolio. McCoy accepted Tenazas as a mid-year transfer student at Cranbrook, receiving an MFA in 2-D Design. In 1985, Tenazas moved to San Francisco for a faculty position at the California College of Arts and Crafts and founded her practice, Tenazas Design. In 2000, she founded the graphic design MFA program at CCA. She felt that the new graduate program ought to develop student‚Äôs ideas through a process of self-discovery. This process of self-discovery is evident in the program‚Äôs interdisciplinary focus which brings together theory and practice to develop the individual‚Äôs personal voice in design. She was the President of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) from 1996 to 1998, becoming the first to be based outside of New York. In 1996, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective of her work. She moved to New York in 2006 with Richard Barnes, her husband, and their two children. She is the Henry Wolf Professor and Associate Dean of the School of Art, Media and Technology (AMT) at the Parsons School of Design. Awards In 2002, Tenazas was awarded the National Design Award in Communications Design by the Smithsonian Cooper- Hewitt National Design Museum.

Biography Not much is known about the early life of Otar Beg. His original family name was Baratashvili-Orbelishvili, which is also referred to as Orbeliani and Qaplanshvili. His father's name was Aslamaz and he had two younger brothers, Vakhushti and Gorjasbi (Mansur), who also held prominent positions like him. According to Alexander Orbeliani (1802‚Äì1869), Otar had one more brother named Kaykhosrow. He furthermore had a known younger cousin named Qaplan Baratashili-Orbelishvili (Orbeliani) (?‚Äì1671), who had fled to mainland Iran in the early 17th century after the death of his father Erizbar Baratashvili-Orbelishvili, the latter being therefore Otar's uncle. Otar was mentioned for the first time in the Iranian sources in 1626, when he held the function of darugha (prefect) of New Julfa, having succeeded Mirman Mirimanidze (Safiqoli Khan) on this post. When king Abbas I died in 1629, he had already been appointed as governor of Semnan and possessed the rank of soltan. Later, in 1649, during the reign of king Abbas II (r. 1562-1666), he was given the governorship of Qandahar in the easternmost territories, as well as the honorary name of Zu al-FaqƒÅr Khan. When Qandahar was surrounded by the Mughal forces in 1653, the city nearly fell due to the protracted siege, and Otar was blamed for his soft attitude. According to the contemporary Safavid historian and author Valiqoli Shamlu, who served Otar personally in Qandahar, Otar answered that he would fight alone till the end and, after his death, behave as generals liked to do. He is quoted: \\"I have served the Safavid kings for seventy years. My bones are made from Shah's (kings) different kinds of graces\\".

Archaeologia Cambrensis 1930 Issue 85, p 409 Prichard reported that 'well constructed walls', one encasing a human skeleton, had been found during the extension of Parciau farmhouse, southwest of the fort, and this may possibly represent a prosperous Roman building. However, these walls were attributed by Prichard's informants to John Bodvel, a famous inhabitant of the 1600s, and a date more recent than Roman may be likely. Extramural traces Immediately west of the fort, on the gentle slope of Bryn Ddi√¥l, aerial photography has shown traces of earthworks (a track way and platforms), extending some 280m from the fort. These have not been excavated. Parciau farmstead lies immediately south of these traces; in 2011 earth working was undertaken to improve the farm buildings, and this work was monitored by Gwynedd Archaeological Trust. However, the area concerned showed no upstanding features of archaeological interest, and mechanical earth stripping showed only the foundations of the preceding structure, with various recent service trenches and access tracks. No archaeology was identified within the remaining undisturbed areas of the site. Summary interpretation Waddington interprets these finds as suggesting that an Iron Age hillfort was abandoned about the time of the Roman conquest of Anglesey, and later re- occupied when security worsened in the later Roman period.Waddington, K.

In Romania, Hilmi was affected by labour movements and he became a socialist. Hilmi and Anarchist Baha Tevfik published ƒ∞≈ütirak on 13 February 1909. With this, Hilmi's liberal life was dead. Now, Hilmi was known with ƒ∞≈ütirak Newspaper. And he was called ƒ∞≈ütirak√ßi Hilmi.  Ottoman Socialist Party era  The Ottoman Socialist Party () was founded by H√ºseyin Hilmi, Namƒ±k Hasan, ƒ∞bn√ºl Tahir ƒ∞smail Faik, Baha Tevfik and Hamit Suphi on August 1910. Party was not a normal socialist party. The party did not want a proletariat state. Also OSF was not interested in socialism. The party became a supporter of the liberal ideas of Prince Sabahaddin. The Ottoman Socialist Party was closed in 1912. After the assassination of Mahmut ≈ûevket Pasha, Hilmi was exiled to Sinop Fortress Prison in 1913. = Ottoman Socialist Party in Paris Branch = Paris Branch of OSF was founded by Doctor Refik Nevzat in the 1910s. After the closing of the party in Istanbul and the exiling of Hilmi, Refik Nevzat became the only representative person of the party. He published 3 brochures for OSF named Siyaset-i Hazƒ±ra-i Me≈ü'ume (Current Sinister Politics), Sosyalizm ve Rehber-i Amele (Socialism and Vanguard Workers) and Hara√ß Mezat Satƒ±yoruz (Auctions Sell Tribute).

Also TSF was a member of the Second International. = Strikes and TSF = In Istanbul, in 1920, the Ottoman worker class launched several strikes for occupation of the country, poor wages, and other reasons. In this atmosphere, TSF became vanguard for Istanbul workers.  Second Congress and dissolution  On 31 October 1920 Party prepared a second congress. In this congress H√ºseyin Hilmi became founder and unchangeable leader.Old Turkish: Fƒ±rkanƒ±n unvanƒ± \\"T√ºrkiye Sosyalist Fƒ±rkasƒ±\\" olup m√ºessisi evveli H√ºseyin Hilmi arkada≈ü l√¢yenazil ve daimi residir / English: Name of this party is \\"Socialist Party of Turkey\\" and our founder and unchangeable leader is H√ºseyin Hilmi friend (comrade). With this, the opposition tried to exile Hilmi and friends. But Hilmi and Hilmi's friends survived this opposition. With this, the opposition split from the party and founded the Independent Socialist Party. After the split, the party lost power.  Third Congress and exiling of Hilmi  On 8 March 1922, the party prepared a third congress. In this congress, Hilmi and supporters were exiled from the party. The party was democratic again but it did not have any effect on the outcome. The party was dissolved.

He played AD Carry for Cloud9 of the League of Legends Championship Series North America until 2019. He won the 2013 Summer NA LCS and 2014 Spring NA LCS with Cloud9.http://espn.go.com/esports/story/_/id/16585487/zachary-sneaky-scuderi Scuderi also gained media attention after posting a cosplay for a popular female League of Legends character, and has since been regularly posting further crossplays on his Twitter, Instagram, and Patreon accounts. He became an independent full-time streamer on Twitch leaving professional scene in January 2020. However, he said that he is not retiring. Biography Originally a Mid Laner for Ordinance Gaming, he quickly transitioned into an AD Carry and bounced around on several NA teams, one of which included Team Dignitas. Eventually, he ended up on Quantic Gaming and together with the original C9 roster which consisted of him, Balls, Meteos, Hai, and LemonNation, they qualified for the NA LCS. In their first split, they completely dominated the competition and won the NA LCS. Sneaky and LemonNation, in particular, gained a reputation for playing the combination of Ashe and Zyra, as well as being a very stable and consistent bottom lane. Sneaky has led Cloud9 to much success domestically, including being the only North American team to have qualified for Worlds every year since the team's inception. Sneaky and Cloud9 have consistently been the best representative of North America at international events including a top 4 placement at the Season 8 World Championship. Career A native of Winter Springs, Florida, just north of Orlando, Sneaky played World of WarCraft competitively achieving highest rated Mage Rogue in 2v2's sometime in Season 6. He also played a lot of HoN, along with playing DOTA on the side. Prior to LoL, He was studying Computer Science for a year at Florida Atlantic University before entering the NA LCS. Sneaky joined Quantic Gaming on April 6, 2013, and proceeded to qualify for the 2013 NA LCS Summer Split and subsequently joined Cloud 9 when C9 re-acquired the Quantic roster ahead of their LCS debut. = 2015 Preseason = Cloud 9 was the North American team fan-voted to IEM San Jose.[1] They defeated paiN Gaming 2‚Äì0, Alliance 2‚Äì1, and then Unicorns of Love 3‚Äì0 to win the tournament. Sneaky capped off the finals against UOL with a game-winning pentakill on Corki. = 2015 Season = Due to their IEM San Jose victory, Cloud9 qualified for IEM Katowice in March. They lost their only two games, first to GE Tigers and then to yoe Flash Wolves, and finished in 7th/8th place. Domestically, they underperformed at the start of the season and were in 8th place at the end of the second week of the spring LCS split. However, they improved over the course of the season, ending with a second-place finish behind Team SoloMid and a playoff bye; after beating Team Liquid 3‚Äì2, Cloud9 lost to TSM 1‚Äì3 in the finals and finished the split overall in second place. Cloud9 replaced mid laner Hai with Incarnati0n at the start of the Summer Split due to Hai's retirement. They performed poorly for the first five weeks of the split and replaced Meteos with Hai going into the sixth week. With Hai back on the team, Cloud9's record improved from 3‚Äì7 to 6‚Äì12 by the end of the split, and they finished in 7th place after a tie-breaker victory against Team 8, narrowly avoiding relegations and retaining their Championship Points, though they did not qualify for playoffs. In the Regional Finals Gauntlet, Cloud9 reverse-swept both Gravity Gaming and Team Impulse before beating Team Liquid 3‚Äì1 in the finals. Their fourteen games played over the course of three days gave them North America's third seed to the 2015 Season World Championship, Cloud9's third-consecutive Worlds. Notably, Sneaky played Vayne in four games (3‚Äì1) and Draven twice (2‚Äì0), and had a 10.09 KDA across Cloud9's victories; he also received the MVP title for the final series of the gauntlet. Considered an underdog at Worlds, Cloud9 were placed into Group B along with Fnatic, ahq, and Invictus Gaming and expected to place last. Instead, they surprised with an undefeated 3‚Äì0 first week. In the second week, Cloud9 needed only one win to advance to the quarterfinals but were unable to find it, losing four games in a row including a tiebreaker loss to ahq. They placed third in their group, ahead of only Invictus Gaming. =2016 Season= For the 2016 season, Cloud9 added two new players ‚Äì Rush and Bunny FuFuu ‚Äì and moved Hai to support, with the intention of splitting time with Bunny. However, after two losses with Bunny and two wins with Hai in the spring split, they committed to starting Hai full-time and rose to a 67% winrate, with a third-place seed in the playoffs. However, despite a seeding advantage, the team lost to TSM in the first round and were eliminated. Sneaky ended up losing the Worlds Quarterfinals with Cloud 9 against Samsung Galaxy. =2017 Season= For the 2017 season, Cloud9 dropped Meteos and added Ray, the top laner from Apex Gaming, as well as Contractz, the jungler from Cloud9's Challenger Series team. Cloud9 proved strong with this roster, finishing in 2nd place with a 70% win rate during the regular split, the highest win rate out of any team. Following their spring success, Cloud9 had a reasonably strong summer split, finishing 4th place. Cloud9 ended up qualifying to the 2017 League of Legends World Championship through the NA Regional qualifier, taking a convincing 3-1 victory over Counter Logic Gaming. Their Worlds journey ended in the quarterfinals losing 2-3 against Team WE of the League of Legends Pro League. =2018 Season= Cloud9 entered the 2018 season replacing Contractz with former TSM jungler Svenskeren, and adding rookie top laner Licorice following Impact's move to Team Liquid. After a strong start to the split and vying for a playoff bye, Cloud9 faltered in the final weeks of the regular season and entered playoffs as the 5th seed after a series of tiebreakers. Cloud9 were defeated 3-0 by Team Liquid in the quarterfinals. Just days before the start of the summer split, Cloud9 owner Jack Etienne and Coach Reapered shocked the League of Legends competitive community by announcing that Sneaky along with Jensen and Smoothie were being benched in favor of Cloud9 Academy players Keith, Goldenglue, and Zeyzal respectively, citing motivation issues and concern the starting roster would not qualify for playoffs. Cloud9 Academy dominated the Academy league, however, the LCS roster struggled and fell to last place in the standings. Smoothie left the team, but Sneaky and Jensen were reinstated to the starting roster. Cloud9 found a winning formula utilizing a 7-man roster, and the team made an undefeated run in the second round robin to secure a 2nd place finish and playoff bye in the summer playoffs. Cloud9 faced TSM in the semifinals and defeated their storied rivals 3-2, the first time Cloud9 had done so in the post-season since the 2014 spring finals. Cloud9 faced Team Liquid in the summer finals where they would once again be defeated by Liquid 3-0. With their 2nd place finish in the summer split, Cloud9 were seeded into the final round of the regional qualifier for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship where they once again faced TSM. Cloud9 defeated TSM in an impressive 3-0 set and qualified for Worlds as North America's 3rd seed. Cloud9 had to go through the Worlds play-in stage, going undefeated 4-0 in their group and defeating Gambit Esports 3-2 to qualify for the group stage. They were seeded into Group B (dubbed \\"the group of death\\") with Team Vitality, defending world champions GenG Esports, and tournament favorites Royal Never Give Up. After a rocky start, Cloud9 defied predictions and escaped the group of death going 3-0 in the second round robin. They faced RNG in a tiebreaker for 1st seed, losing after a close game and entered the knockout bracket as a 2nd seed. Cloud9 faced Afreeca Freecs in the quarterfinals where they defeated the Korean team 3-0, becoming the first team from North America to reach top 4 at Worlds in seven years. Their semifinal match against Europe's Fnatic had even greater implications as it guaranteed the appearance of a western team in the World Finals for the first time since the inaugural tournament in 2011. Fnatic defeated Cloud9 3-0. For his part in Cloud9's miracle run from last place in North America to top 4 at Worlds, Sneaky was chosen by fan vote to attend the 2018 All-Star Event. = 2019 Season = In the 2019 season, Nisqy joined as mid lane following Jensen's move to Team Liquid. Cloud9 had a strong spring split, finishing second in the regular season, but were defeated in a reverse sweep against TSM in the semi-finals. In summer Cloud9 had a strong split, but lost to Team Liquid in the finals in 5 games. = 2020 Season = On January 15, 2020, Sneaky left the Cloud9 NA LCS Roster but remained an owner and advisor of the team. He is currently pursuing a career as a full-time Twitch streamer, though his teammates speculate he will likely make a return to professional play. On July 10th, 2020, Sneaky returned for a special LCS showmatch and the old Cloud9 team are reunited with Balls, Meteos, Hai, and LemonNation in order to face off TSM Classic consisting of Dyrus, TheOddOne, VoyBoy (replacing Reginald), WildTurtle, and Xpecial.

In 794 he launched a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate, but was defeated and killed in 795.  Career  Map of the Jazira and surrounding regions In several sources al-Walid is referred to as a member of the Banu Taghlib, but Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani and Ibn Khallikan call him a Shaybani, and in the opinion of Clifford Edmund Bosworth the latter identification is the correct one. He was considered a chief of the Kharijites, and reportedly acquired a reputation for audacity and bravery. During his lifetime he usually resided in the area of Nasibin and al-Khabur, in the region of the Jazira. In 794 al- Walid revolted against the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid and quickly gathered a large number of supporters around him. He soon overran much of the Jazira and killed the governor of Diyar Rabi'a when the latter marched against him, then invaded Diyar Mudar and besieged 'Abd al-Malik ibn Salih in Raqqa. The Kharijites subsequently moved on to Arminiya and besieged Khilat, whose inhabitants agreed to ransom themselves in exchange for their liberty, and proceeded to invade Adharbayjan, Hulwan, the Sawad of Iraq and the districts on the west bank of the Tigris, enriching themselves along the way.

Yazid met the rebels in battle in late 795, at al-Haditha above Hit, and defeated al-Walid in single combat, killing him and cutting off his head.

It was built from 1885 to 1913. It is also known as Hamilton railway station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 July 2005.  History  The Mirani railway station opened on 10 August 1885. The station formed part of the Pioneer Valley Line of the Mackay Railway which opened on the same day. In search of new pastoral land, John Mackay and his party entered and named the valley of the Mackay River in 1860 (renamed Pioneer River in 1862), and the following year he returned to establish a cattle station. Other settlers quickly followed. In 1862, the ketch \\"Presto\\" entered the Mackay River landing stores and building materials, then surveyed the river mouth, which consequently was gazetted as a Port of Entry. In the earliest years of non-Indigenous settlement of the Pioneer Valley, the area was leased as two cattle runs, Hamilton and Hopetoun. They were worked as one property with the head station at Hamilton, across the Pioneer River from the township now known as Mirani. Prior to the opening of the railway station in 1885, Mirani was known as Hamilton, after one of the cattle properties, but was changed so that no confusion could arise between it and Hamilton in Brisbane. Sugar cane is a bulky crop that transports well, but it needs to be processed quickly once harvested. In the 19th century, the only transport method that answered these requirements was the railway. Every sugar district developed a network of tramways and railways, provided by a combination of the sugar mills, local government and the Queensland Government. Agitation for a local rail network began in the late 1870s. The principal advocates were the independent cane growers who were forced to send their cane to the nearest plantation mill to be crushed. The first sugar mill in the district, John Ewen Davidson's, Alexandra was established in 1868. A government-run rail network was a means of overcoming that dependence and allowing growers to choose which mill crushed their cane. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company had introduced the two feet gauge steam tramway to the Queensland canefields when it built three large sugar mills simultaneously, at Homebush south-west of Mackay, at Victoria on the Herbert River and at Goondi on the Johnstone River. Homebush Mill opened in 1883. Approval for the Pioneer Valley line was granted by the Queensland Parliament in October 1882. Mackay was growing in name as the centre of a prosperous sugar district, and, due to the input on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, already had private steam tramways. In 1880 John Spiller built a five kilometre line on his River Estate plantation and worked it with a locally built vertical boiler engine. The following year he built a similar line on his Pioneer plantation, both on the north side of the river. A railway route was surveyed west from Mackay parallel to the south bank of the river to a point opposite Hamilton (later Mirani) station and construction began in late 1883. The contract was awarded to George Bashford & Co in late 1883. Nearly 2000 people assembled to watch the Governor ceremonially turn the first sod on his first visit to Mackay even though work had been underway for a month. The first stage from Mackay to Mirani was opened on 10 August 1885. A branch line commencing at Newbury Junction, west of Mackay, ran south towards Eton, the only other settlement of note in the district apart from Mackay and Walkerston. Construction work on the railway line was virtually halted for three months in 1884 due to flooding which, at the time, was the highest on record. The railway station became a focal point of the township of Mirani. A post mistress was appointed and all postal business was conducted from the station from 1888 to 1924 when separate postal facilities were established in Alexandra Street. Harry Wesche planted mango trees in the station's yard when he worked there c.1915. Some of those trees survive today. In 1885, with the Mackay Railway terminating at Mirani, the town was the limit of closer settlement. Throughout the 1890s the government received requests for the Pioneer Valley line to be extended to open up more land for cane, particularly the extensive area of land that lay between Mirani and the Eungella Ranges. The Pioneer River however, was a significant barrier. A short extension of the line was finally made over the Pioneer River at Mirani in 1897 to give growers access to rail transport. Expenditure for the bridge of five, long steel spans on high concrete piers was approved and contract let to A Overend & Co, in August 1896. The two kilometres of track to Mirani West, officially opened on 11 December 1897, were laid without authority until the plans were resubmitted by the Philp Government and approved in December 1900. The extension further west to Pinnacle, opened on 7 July 1902. This was the first line completed under the new day labour system. The Pioneer Valley Line of the Mackay Railway was the catalyst for the establishment of the township, Mirani, that became an important secondary centre within the Mackay region. Further, the Pioneer Valley line was instrumental in the expansion of the sugar industry, significantly increasing the amount of land that could be cultivated for sugar on an economically viable basis, as well as being a critical factor in the development of a central mill system, providing an alternate transport system to shipping, thus enabling cane plantations to be located away from major waterways. There was little goods traffic. The line carefully avoided any contact with the Homebush mill tramway, whilst the sugar mills at Meadowlands, Te Kowai, Alexandra, Palms, Pleystowe and Marian continued to haul sugar to town and cane to the mill by road. Only the Victoria Sugar Mill near Eton was right beside the railway. Matters were rectified after a visit to Mackay by Commissioner Curnow in April 1887, and the department agreed to build short spurs to Te Kowai, Palms, Alexandra and Pleystowe mills, with the owners repaying the cost over five years. A similar siding had already been built to Marian mill; it was repaid by a surcharge. The Government financed the construction of two Central Mills in 1888, Racecourse Sugar Mill beside the railway line at the Lagoons and at North Eton. The latter had a siding to Drapers (south-west of Mackay) which was shifted in 1902 to connect at Victoria. By 1899, the Mirani Railway comprised the station building, with an addition to the roadside, as well as a detached kitchen. In 1899, Henrik Hansen prepared drawings for a ladies' room and closet to be added to the Finch Hatton end of the building. In 1913, the building was remodelled resulting in the removal of the curved timber brackets to the shade (which was characteristic of nineteenth century railway architecture) and the substitution of ladder frame brackets carried on fretted struts and similar spandrels to the shelter shed with shades to both sides of the building located on an island platform. By 1960 the Mirani railway station consisted of the station building, lamp room, quarters, loading bank, goods shed, whim derrick and forkline with trucking yards. The Mackay Railway, from Kowari to Netherdale, officially closed on 19 December 1977 after being damaged by flooding. In 1981 a lease of the quarters was offered to the Pioneer Valley Historical Society. In 1988, the station building and residence were to be sold for removal. The Mirani Shire Council was successful in obtaining a grant through the Bicentennial funding to adapt the former station building for reuse as a museum. The grant allowed for the former station building to remain on site. The section of the Mackay Railway between Marian and Finch Hatton (which included the Mirani Railway Station) closed on 2 October 1990. This is becoming a common pattern in sugar districts as industry deregulation results in cane lands going out of production and mills closing. Many tram and rail lines are disappearing and road transport is taking an increasing share of the harvest to the mills. The former station building continues to be cared for by the Mackay Regional Council (the successor to the Mirani Shire Council) which owns the property.  Description  The Mirani Railway Station is a single storey, timber framed building, set on low timber stumps, clad with timber weatherboards. The building has a gable roof clad with corrugated iron. Timber louvered ventilators are located high in the western and eastern elevations. The roof extends on both the northern and southern sides of the building creating shade to these sides. The fretted shelter shed spandrels running the length of the structure on the northern and southern sides compare with the Finch Hatton railway station, further west along the line. Spaces that have previously been used as office area, ladies' room and closet (altered) are located to either side of the shelter shed area. Booking windows face the shelter area. Station name boards are extant along the railway line. A single storey timber trolley shed is located approximately to the east of the railway station building. The children's playground area structures and equipment are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Mirani railway station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 July 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mirani railway station building is important as a substantially intact example of a country branch line station building, demonstrating the importance of the Queensland sugar industry's railway networks and the gradual loss of this network following industry deregulation and a shift to road transport of harvested cane. Located on the Pioneer Valley Line of the Mackay Railway, the Mirani railway station building is an extant reminder of the growth of the district as pre-eminent cane growing area in the late 19th and early 20th century. The opening of the area through the establishment of the railway also prompted the development of the timber industry. The Mirani railway station building is further significant as the earliest surviving building on the Mackay Railway and is closely comparable with Finch Hatton Railway Station building, further to the west. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. With spaces formerly comprising an office area, shelter area with shade to both sides of the building and ticket windows facing the shelter areas, the Mirani Railway Station building is a good example of a country branch line timber railway building. Its decorative fretted shelter shed spandrels compare with the Finch Hatton Railway Station building.

It is known commonly as the black larder beetle or incinerator beetle (not to be confused with Dermestes haemorrhoidalis, the African larder beetle, also sometimes referred to as the black larder beetle).Bujang, N. S. & Kaufman, P. E. Black larder beetle, incinerator beetle, Dermestes ater DeGeer (Insecta: Coleoptera: Dermestidae). Publication #EENY480, University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) Extension. August 2010. It is native to North America, but today it is found nearly worldwide. Like several other dermestid beetles, this species is a common pest of stored products. Description The adult beetle is about 7 to 9 millimeters long. It has black or brown elytra and a coating of yellowish hairs. The male can be distinguished from the female by a row of bristles along the abdomen. The larva is white with long dark bristles, its body darkening in color to black, brown, or reddish as it grows. It reaches a maximum length around 14 millimeters. Dermestes ater resembles D. haemorrhoidalis and D. peruvianus but differs in several ways. In D. ater the first visible sternite bear impressed lines parallel to the lateral margin that are angled inwards towards the base, therefore their end that is next to the metasternal hind margin is at some distance from the edge; while on D. peruvianus and D. haemorrhoidalis these lines are parallel to the side margin throughout their length. Dermestes ater further differs from the two other species in having a symmetrical pattern of light and dark pubescence on all abdominal sternites. The dark pubescence being near the side edges. The dark pubescence may be barely visible so these areas may appear glabrous next to the lighter (grey) pubescence.Watford Coleoptera Group, Dermestes ater Life cycle The female lays 1 to 25 eggs at a time. They are whitish and about 2 millimeters long. The eggs hatch in a few days, depending on temperature. Larval development also depends on temperature, as well as humidity and food availability. Each larva may proceed through six to nine instars, taking 19 to 50 days to grow to maximum size. It then pupates for several days. The adult lives for around 169 days, depending on temperature. Economic and scientific importance The beetle attacks many types of stored food and other products. It has been found in cheese, dried fish, leather, copra, silk, wool, milk powder, incinerated waste, hog bristles, dried mushrooms, cacao, and ginger.Roth, L. M., & Willis, E. R. (1950). The oviposition of Dermestes ater Degeer, with notes on bionomics under laboratory conditions. American Midland Naturalist 44(2) 427-447. It is an occasional predator, feeding on live insects; it is a pest of the sericulture industry because it preys on silkworm pupae, damaging the silk cocoons in the process.Veer, V., Negi, B. K., & Rao, K. M. (1996). Dermestid beetles and some other insect pests associated with stored silkworm cocoons in India, including a world list of dermestid species found attacking this commodity. Journal of Stored Products Research, 32(1), 69-89. It also feeds on housefly (Musca domestica) larvae and pupae in places where both insects congregate, such as poultry houses.Menezes, L. C., Rossi, M. N., & Reigada, C. (2005). Consequences of refuge for the functional response of Dermestes ater (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) to Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae). Population Ecology, 47(3), 213-219. The adult may cannibalize larvae and pupae of its own species, and the larvae may eat each other and the eggs. It is also a scavenger of dead animals. It is a pest of museum collections, such as dried insects. It has been found living in and consuming human corpses, so it may play a role in forensic entomology.Kumara, T. K., et al. (2009).

Clauser also wrote the screenplay. Plot The story is set in Vevay, Indiana in the 1930s and revolves around the titular character, Sooner, a girl of unknown parentage who is being raised by an elderly backwoods woman, Old Mam Hawes (Cloris Leachman), who earns a living making illegal moonshine. Hawes takes Sooner into town and attempts to collect foster care funds for raising Sooner, but this brings her worth as a guardian into question with the Sheriff (Don Murray). Sooner is taken in by a childless couple, Mac and Elizabeth McHenry (Richard Crenna and Lee Remick), in Mac's hopes that having a child in the house will bring Elizabeth out of her depression. Elizabeth begins to form a bond with Sooner. Sooner is excited about the idea of attending the local school, and she is enrolled. After a bumpy start, she becomes comfortable there. One day Sooner brings home some children from school to show them her pet bird, whom Sooner had with her when she was taken in by the McHenrys. The children ask why the bird doesn't fly and she says that it's because he doesn't want to. The children and Sooner stamp the ground and throw things at the bird to encourage it to fly, but this results in the death of the bird. Elizabeth comes outside to see what the commotion is and is horrified to find the bird dead. Sooner is initially emotionless about this. Elizabeth sends the children away and Sooner to her room. The next morning Elizabeth awakes to find Sooner gone. Sooner had run back home to Old Mam Hawes during the night, and had dug up and taken the body of bird with her. Sooner buries the bird near where she had found him, and finally feels remorse. Elizabeth drives out in the country and finds Old Mam Hawes cabin. Sooner is nowhere to be seen and Hawes berates Elizabeth about how much better a guardian she is compared to Elizabeth, and that Sooner is where she should be now. Some time passes. The McHenrys have a difficult time in their relationship with the loss of Sooner. Sooner continues to live with Old Mam Hawes, who tells her they may move to Florida, where it's \\"warm all year 'round\\". As the annual fair approaches, Jim Seevey (Michael Gross), whom Hawes sells her whiskey to, arrives and says that there will be extra state inspectors at the fair and he will not be able to sell her whiskey bootleg there. Hawes sends Seevy away in a rage and tells Sooner to hook up their old horse William to the cart because they are going to take the whiskey to the fair and sell it themselves. Sooner says that old William cannot handle the load, but Hawes insists anyway. At the fair, which Sooner has never been to before, Hawes gives Sooner some money ‚Äì something she had never done before ‚Äì and tells Sooner to not get lost. As Sooner buys some cotton candy Elizabeth sees her and buys her some more food. They then ride the Ferris wheel together and Sooner gets ill from it. Finally they return to the horse cart and find Hawes there, trying to whip William to move, but William dies from the strain. As Mac attends to William and declares him dead, Sooner acknowledges that William died, just like bird had. The Sheriff arrives and threatens to send Old Mam Hawes off. Hawes said she's about had it and will move to Florida. The Sheriff says he'd happily pay to see that happen. Hawes angrily tells Sooner to stay with the McHenrys, but after walking a distance away is shown to be looking back at Sooner. Reunited, Mac, Elizabeth and Sooner go home.

He was the older brother of Agathocles, king of Syracuse, and was a commander  or strategos  of the troops sent by the Syracusans to the relief of Crotona when it was besieged by the Bruttii tribe in 317. Siege of Syracuse In the late 4th century, Sicily was invaded by Carthage and Syracuse itself was besieged by the Carthaginians. In 310, Agathocles hatched a daring plan to sneak out of Sicily with a sizable force to invade Libya, to draw the Carthaginians out of Sicily, leaving Antander together with Erymnon in command of Syracuse. During the absence of Agathocles in Africa, the Carthaginians under Hamilcar pressed their siege. Some ancient sources report that Antander wished to surrender to Hamilcar after receiving news that Agathocles's fleet had been burned and that Erymnon persuaded him not to. More recent scholarship indicates that Hamilcar tried a ruse to convince Antander his brother's army had been destroyed by showing Antander the charred remains of his brother's boats, while in reality, Agathocles had burned his own ships as a tactic to move to a land assault. A debate erupted in the Syracusan assembly in which a man named Diognetus (or Phalaeneus), proposed surrendering to the Carthaginians, and Antander had the man arrested to prevent the spread of the idea to the besieged Syracusans. In any case, Syracuse survived the siege. Executions Antander is mentioned afterwards as the instrument of his brother's cruelty: in 307, Agathocles commanded Antander to execute the families of all the rebellious Syracusan soldiers who remained in Africa (whom Agathocles blamed for the death of his sons), and Antander is said to have ruthlessly carried out this order, slaughtering men, women, children, and the elderly.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xix. 3, xx. 16, 72. Even more horrifying to the ancient mind, Antander's forces piled these bodies on the beach for the waves to take, denying them burial rites. During Agathocles's absence from Syracuse, silver tetradrachms (previously issued under Agathocles's name only) were issued with Antander's monogram. Antander was also the author of a historical work - an apologetic biography of his brother Agathocles - which is quoted by the ancient historian Diodorus Siculus.Diodorus Siculus, Exc. xxi. 12, p. 492, ed. Wess. It is not known how long Antander lived, only that he outlived his brother Agathocles, who died in 289.

It also covers the popular memory of critical historical events, ideas and leaders, as well as the depiction of those events in museums, monuments, reenactments, pageants and historic sites, and the editing of historical documents. Monumenta Germaniae Historica. Medieval and early modern Diarium Europaeum was a journal on the history of the German-speaking lands founded by Martin Meyer (Philemerus Irenicus Elisius) and published between 1659 and 1683 in 45 volumes. Very precise editing of historic documents was a main concern in the 19th century, as exemplified by Monumenta Germaniae Historica. It published many thousands of documents, both chronicle and archival, for the study of German history (broadly conceived) from the end of the Roman Empire to 1500. The MGH was founded in Hanover in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 was Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795 to 1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by Georg Waitz (1813-1886) . Many eminent medievalists participated in the project, searching for and annotating documents.David Knowles, \\"The Monumenta Germaniae Historica'.\\" in Knowles, ed, (1963): 63-97. in JSTOR The Die Deutschen Inschriften project begun in 1934 collects and redacts medieval and early modern inscriptions in Germany. Justus M√∂ser (1720 - 1794), was a German jurist, best known for his innovative history of Osnabr√ºck (1768) which stressed social and cultural themes.W. J. Bossenbrook, \\"Justus M√∂ser's Approach to History,\\" in Medieval and Historiographical Essays in Honor of James Westfall Thompson (Chicago, 1938), pp 397-422. 19th century =Hegel and Marx= Another important German thinker was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \\"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own freedom and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\\".Lectures, p. 138. This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them: Hegel's main historical enterprise was to study the emergence of the idea of freedom. Starting with China and India, which gave a very limited scope to freedom, he moves to ancient Persia and Greece, which had much more sophisticated views, and then to Rome, which added a policy of rule by law. Christianity added a positive spirit to the Roman idea of freedom, but during the Middle Ages, according to Hegel, tight Church control led to stagnation. The breakthrough for freedom came during the Renaissance, and especially during the Reformation. Hegel concludes that the constitutional monarchy of the Germanic and Scandinavian states, and Britain, represents so far the highest stage of freedom. He dismisses democracy is a step backward. His uses a three-stage approach: the status quo is the \\"thesis\\", the challenge to it (as represented by Socrates, Christianity, and Luther) is the \\"antithesis\\" with the outcome being a synthesis at a higher stage of development of freedom.Marnie Hughes-Warrington, Fifty key thinkers on history (Routledge, 2007) pp 135-43. Karl Marx followed the Hegelian dialectic method, but inverting it to make material factors (especially economic factors) superior to virtual forces.Sidney Hook, From Hegel to Marx: studies in the intellectual development of Karl Marx (1994). Marx introduced the concept of historical materialism into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in Western Europe. The first stage was primitive communism where property was shared and there was no concept of \\"leadership\\". This progressed to a slave society where the idea of class emerged and the State developed. Feudalism was characterized by an aristocracy working in partnership with a Church and the emergence of the Nation-state. Capitalism appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a market economy, with private property and Parliamentary democracy. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of socialism, followed by Communism, where property would be communally owned.Gerald Allan Cohen, Karl Marx's theory of history: a defence (2nd ed. 2000) onlineHughes-Warrington, Fifty key thinkers on history (2007) pp 215-24. =Niebuhr= Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776 ‚Äì 1831) became Germany's leading historian of Ancient Rome and a founding father of modern scholarly historiography. By 1810 Niebuhr was inspiring German patriotism in students at the University of Berlin by his analysis of Roman economy and government. Niebuhr was a leader of the Romantic Era and symbol of German national spirit that emerged after the humiliating defeat Of the German Army by Napoleon at Jena in 1806. But he was also deeply rooted in the classical spirit of the Age of Enlightenment in his intellectual presuppositions, his use of philological analysis, and his emphasis on both general and particular phenomena in history. He emphasized use of the techniques that philologist had used to study ancient documents, stressing that historical research had to be based primarily on primary sources.Peter Hanns Reill, \\"Barthold Georg Niebuhr and the Enlightenment Tradition.\\" German Studies Review (1980): 9-26. in JSTOR =Leopold von Ranke= Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) established modern methods history in history at his seminar in Berlin The modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities, especially the University of Berlin and the University of G√∂ttingen. Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) at Berlin was the pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.Frederick C. Beiser (2011) The German Historicist Tradition, p.254Green and Troup (eds.), The Houses of History, p. 2: \\"Leopold von Ranke was instrumental in establishing professional standards for historical training at the University of Berlin between 1824 and 1871.\\" According to Caroline Hoefferle, \\"Ranke was probably the most important historian to shape historical profession as it emerged in Europe and the United States in the late 19th century.\\"Caroline Hoefferle, Essential Historiography Reader (Pearson, 2011) p. 68.Georg G.

Specifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514, Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \\"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on primary sources, an emphasis on narrative history and especially international politics (aussenpolitik).E. Sreedharan, A textbook of historiography, 500 BC to AD 2000 (2004) p 185 Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity. Ranke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the Prussian government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift. =Nationalism= Across Europe, the nationalization of history took place in the 19th century, as part of national revivals in the 19th century. Historians emphasize the cultural, linguistic, religious and ethnic roots of the nation, leading to a strong support for their own government on the part of many ethnic groups, especially the Germans and Italians Italians. It had a profound impact on Germany, providing strong widespread intellectual support for the unification achieved in 1870-71.Leonard Krieger, The German idea of freedom: History of a political tradition from the Reformation to 1871 (1957). An especially influential German historian was Heinrich von Treitschke (1834-1896).H.W.C. Davis, The political thought of Heinrich von Treitschke (1915). online = Other historians= Johann Gustav Droysen (1808 ‚Äì 1884) moved from his original interest in Rome to the history of Prussia, He was perhaps most influential for his consideration of the nature of historiography, making a strong case for the autonomy of history regardless of the growing prestige of the sciences.Arthur Alfaix Assis, What Is History For? Johan Gustav Droysen and the Functions of Historiography (2014)Thomas Burger, \\"Droysen's defense of historiography: a note.\\" History and Theory (1977): 16#2 168‚Äì173. in JSTOR Karl Lamprecht (1856- 1915) was the most controversial historian in Germany around 1900. His great goal was to fashion on all-embracing, scientific cultural history of the German nation, challenged the Rankean policies that had become governing tenets of German historiography.Roger Chickering, Karl Lamprecht: a German academic life (1856-1915) (BRILL, 1993). Wilhelm Dilthey (1833 ‚Äì 1911) was a historian, psychologist, sociologist, and philosopher, who held Hegel's Chair in Philosophy at the University of Berlin. Is best known for his philosophy of history, whereby he distinguished the humanities from the physical sciences. A lifelong concern was to establish a proper theoretical and methodological foundation for the \\"human sciences\\" (e.g. history, law, literary criticism), distinct from, but equally \\"scientific\\" as, the \\"natural sciences\\" (e.g. physics, chemistry). He suggested that all human experience divides naturally into two parts: that of the surrounding natural world, in which \\"objective necessity\\" rules, and that of inner experience, characterized by sovereignty of the will, personal responsibility for one's actions, an ability to subject everything to reasoning and to protect one's own autonomy. Historians used his approach to rebuff arguments that history was not fully \\"scientific.\\"Michael Ermarth, Wilhelm Dilthey: The critique of historical reason (1978). In religious history, Adolf von Harnack (1851 ‚Äì 1930) and Ernst Troeltsch (1865 ‚Äì 1923) were highly influential well beyond Germany. Harnack's history of early Christianity gave a liberal Protestant interpretation. Troeltsch's explored the sociology of Christian believers, which he based on the sociology of Max Weber.Ernst Troeltsch, The Social Teachings of the Christian Church (2 vol. translation, Harper Row, 1960)..Wilhelm Pauck, Harnack and Troeltsch: Two historical theologians (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2015) Sonderweg A major historiographical debate about the German history concerns the Sonderweg, the alleged \\"special path\\" that separated German history from the normal course of historical development, and whether or not Nazi Germany was the inevitable result of the Sonderweg. Proponents of the Sonderweg theory such as Fritz Fischer point to such events of the Revolution of 1848, the authoritarianism of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as Gerhard Ritter of the Sonderweg theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the Sonderweg concept as for the reasons for the Sonderweg, and whether or not the Sonderweg ended in 1945. Was there a Sonderweg?

And, in any case, no country on earth > ever took what can be described as the 'normal path.'Heinrich August > Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West (2006), vol 1 p 1 Debate on World War One Fritz Fischer (1908 ‚Äì 1999) was best known for his analysis of the causes of World War I. In the early 1960s Fischer published Germany's Aims in the First World War. He put forward the controversial thesis that responsibility for the outbreak of the war rested solely with Imperial Germany. That set off a long debate that reverberates into the 21st century. He has been described by The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing as the most important German historian of the 20th century.John Moses, \\"Fischer, Fritz,\\" in Kelly Boyd, ed., The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing (1999) 1:387. Fischer argued that Germany had a policy of deliberately provoking war during July 1914 and that during the war Germany developed a set of annexationist war aims similar to those of Adolf Hitler during the Second World War.Matthew Stibbe, \\"The Fischer Constrovery over German War aims in the First World War and its reception by East German Historians 1961-1989,\\" Historical Journal 46#3 (2003), pp. 649‚Äì668 On publication, the book caused controversy in West Germany as it challenged the view that Hitler was an aberration by emphasising the continuity in German foreign policy in 1914 and 1939. The book was also controversial for challenging the established view that Germany did not bear the primary responsibility for outbreak of the war, the so-called \\"war guilt lie\\". Fischer also claimed that German elites had wanted war since as early as 1902. Historian John Moses stated in his 1975 work The Politics of Illusion that \\"No serious German historian today can venture to pit himself against the evidence compiled by the Fischer school.\\"John Moses, The Politics of Illusion (1975) p 127 Fischer inspired several disciples, including the historian Imanuel Geiss. However, Fischer was ridiculed by conservative German historians who created a backlash against his ideas. The most notable critic was conservative historian and patriot Gerhard Ritter. Fischer's ideas were welcomed by historians in communist East Germany where Fritz Klein considered Fischer's views to be uncontroversial.Joll James and Gordon Martel, The Origins of the First World War (3rd ed, 2007) p 6 =Prominent historians= Oswald Spengler (1880 ‚Äì 1936) published The Decline of the West (Der Untergang des Abendlandes), in two volumes in 1918 and 1922, covering all of world history. The book was widely translated and carried the pessimistic implication that Western Civilization was now in irreversible decline, a timely theme in the aftermath of the horrors of the Great War. It had an enormous impact on intellectuals across the world in the 1920s, but its unusually broad sweeping interpretations of all of past history had little direct influence on the scholarship of working historians in Germany.John Farrenkopf, Prophet of Decline: Spengler on World History & Politics (2001)Hughes-Warrington, Fifty key thinkers on history (2007) pp 284-91. Bielefeld School of social history The Bielefeld School is a group of German historians based originally at Bielefeld University who promote social history and political history using quantification and the methods of political science and sociology.Lorenz, Chris \\"Wehler, Hans-Ulrich\\" pages 1289‚Äì1290 from The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Volume 2 page 1289 The leaders include Hans-Ulrich Wehler, J√ºrgen Kocka and Reinhart Koselleck. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great leaders history, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as \\"historical social science\\" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft since 1975. Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by National Socialism. The German brand of \\"history of society\\" ‚Äî Gesellschaftsgeschichte ‚Äî has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. Modernization theory was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform \\"traditional\\" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few \\"great men,\\" into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of Max Weber, with concepts also from Marx, Otto Hintze, Gustav Schmoller, Werner Sombart and Thorstein Veblen.Roger Fletcher, \\"Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics.\\" German Studies Review 1984 7(3): 451-480. in JSTOR Historikerstreit and Nazi Germany The Historikerstreit (\\"historians' quarrel\\") was an intellectual and political controversy in the late 1980s in West Germany about the crimes of Nazi Germany, including their comparability with the crimes of the Soviet Union. The Historikerstreit pitted right-wing against left-wing intellectuals. The positions taken by the right- wing intellectuals were largely based on the totalitarianism approach which takes a comparative approach to totalitarian states, while left-wing intellectuals argued that fascism was uniquely evil, referred to as the Sonderweg approach, and could not be equated with the crimes of Soviet communism. The former were accused by their critics of downplaying Nazi crimes, while the latter were accused by their critics of downplaying Soviet crimes. The debate attracted much media attention in West Germany, with its participants' frequently giving television interviews and writing op-ed pieces in newspapers. It flared up again briefly in 2000 when one of its leading figures, Ernst Nolte, was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for science.

His descendants were created baronets in 1804. Earliest origins The Lethbridge family is supposedly descended from Ragnar Lodbrok (alias Lethbroke, etc),Prince, pp. 564‚Äì5 a Norse king and saga-character of dubious historicity, possibly an amalgam of several historical ninth-century figures. =Legend 1= The origin of the Lethbridge family is ascribed by legend (due to the \\"fancies of mellancholly monks\\", according to the historian Sir Winston Churchill (1620‚Äì1688), father of the 1st Duke of MarlboroughPrince, p.564) to have been in the person of \\"Lethbroke, a noble Dane\\", who having lost his hawk whilst out hunting by the sea-shore, got into a small boat to follow it and was blown onto the coast of Norfolk at Rodham. He was received by King Edmund, whose entertainment of him aroused jealousy in Beric, the royal falconer. Beric murdered Lethbroke, but the buried body was found by his spaniel dog, and he was convicted of the crime. His punishment was to be put in Lethbroke's own boat and set adrift. By chance he drifted not only back to Denmark, but to the very spot where Lethbroke had embarked. He was captured by the local Danes, who recognised Lethbroke's boat, and whom he informed falsely that Lethbroke had been killed by King Edmund. On hearing the story the King of Denmark dispatched an invasionary force to England, commanded by Lethbroke's two sons Hunga and Hubba. The sisters of the latter made a banner to be carried by their brothers, embroidered with a black raven, or eagle. Thus an eagle displayed sable features in the Lethbridge armorials. =Legend 2= Sir Winston Churchill of Devon stated the true origins as follows: Reigner, King of Norway was driven out of his kingdom by Harold, King of Denmark, and turned to piracy. During one of his many raids on the north-east coast of England, he was shipwrecked off Norfolk, and captured by the local population, who killed him and whilst dragging his body around in derision, \\"called him in scorn Lothbroc, meaning \\"leather-breech\\", from the material of his trousers. He was soon avenged by three of his sons, Ivor, Hungar and Hubbo, who as younger sons in accordance with Norse custom had been banished from their own country to make a living abroad, and who invaded England near Appledore in North Devon. \\"Like young rooks drove from their nests, they took that bird for their cognizance, which being embroidered by their vestal sisters in a banner, consecrated after the horrid rites of their paganish superstition (which rendered it, as the vulgar believed impossible to be taken) they sate it up as the royal standard, calling it by the name of the \\"Reafan\\", i.e. the raven\\". The Raven standard inspired the invaders with \\"more than humane courage\\", but was insufficient to defeat the English at the battle which is supposed to have taken place at Hubbleston or \\"Hubba's Rock\\", between the villages of Northam and Bideford in North Devon.

Based on a similar concept to the Mulberry harbour used for the Normandy landings in 1944, Lily and Clover were two different types of floating airstrips that would allow the Royal Navy to operate aircraft before a shore base is secured and removed the need for an aircraft carrier. Lily was a collection of flotation units developed for the floating roadways used in the Mulberry harbour. Each was six feet across, plates being fitted on the top to form the runway. The complete structure could be towed and weighed 5,000 tons, taking 400 man-hours to construct. Clover was built mainly of wood with wooden deck planking which could take a load of eight tons. It weighed more than Lily at 5,200 tons but would take 21,000 man-hours to assemble. The resulting runway was 1,000 feet long and 90 feet wide with 12,500 square feet of parking area and 45,000 square feet for storage and maintenance. Trials were carried in the Firth of Clyde at Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Both an Auster and Fairey Swordfish aircraft were used for the trials. The trial was a success and proved that both Lily and Clover could take aircraft up to 9,000 lb with a 60-knot landing speed in calm seas. Lily was tested successfully with 30-foot waves but became dangerous at 40-foot. Lily was maintained for nine-months with little deterioration, but Clover did not stand up as well. Lily was designed to be assembled from a merchant ship and it was clear that the structure could not be sunk by bombing, with damaged sections replaced as required. Landing technique was similar to an aircraft carrier, once the undulation was taken into account, with an arrester gear fitted similar to that used on Light Fleet Carriers. The floating airstrips were seen as a back-up for escort carriers and would have operated 48 Supermarine Spitfires. The concept was intended to be used for Operation Zipper (the invasion of Japan), but the war in the Far- East ended before they were used operationally.

History Built along with Variante de Po√° by EFCB on 7 February 1926, only was opened with the branch on 1 January 1934. It was named after the assistant engineer of 5th Division of EFCB, Antonio Calmon Viana. Before being operated by CPTM, the station was administrated by other state companies: EFCB, RFFSA, EBTU and CBTU) which were, at the time, responsible for the lines. For decades, it kept the original structure and not passing by any great reform, what caused too much time of discomfort to commuters because of an old and outdated structure, lacking accessibility items. On 15 October 2010, the station was reopened after a great reform that preserved the main building, modernized the station infrastructure with the installing of a new metallic catwalk; elevators, restrooms and modern signaling for disabled people; public restrooms and bike parking; besides many improvements in visual communication. A new platform was built, the fourth of the station. In the station opening ceremony, a new train was delivered for Line 12-Sapphire. Many authorities were present, like Governor of S√£o Paulo Alberto Goldman, Mayor of Po√° Francisco Pereira de Souza, and Chairman of CPTM S√©rgio Avelleda. After the reform, a gradual increase of boardings occurred, being the only transference catwalk overloaded. In some moments, unhappy commuters chose to change platforms by crossing the tracks. After many complaints reached the Legislative Assembly, State Deputy Marcos Damasio (PL) requested to the CPTM, through the Indication No. 1492/2019, the install of a second transference catwalk between the platforms. Toponymy Ant√¥nio Vicente Calmon Viana was born in Bahia on 12 April 1867, grandson of Francisco Vicente Viana, 1st Baron of Rio das Contas. Joined the Politechnical School of University of Brazil, graduating in Engineering. After acting in railways in Pernambuco, joined EFCB in 1895. Worked as division assistant in 1914.

Geography  The neighbourhood of Victoria is located within North Eton. The land is very flat, 30 metres above sea level, with a small rise on the western edge of the locality at the foothills of Mount Kinchant (in the neighbouring locality of Kinchant Dam). The north branch of Sandy Creek flows from the north-west to the south-east of the locality and is part of the Plane Creek drainage basin. The land is entirely used for farming, predominantly sugarcane.  History  North Eton Sugar Mill, circa 1912 The area has been known as both North Eton and Eton North. Originally known as the Defiance, the North Eton Central Mill commenced crushing sugarcane in 1888. It was the first sugar mill sponsored by the Queensland Government. In 1989, a number of sugar mills in the district merged to Mackay Sugar Limited, resulting in the closure of the North Eton mill. The North Eton State School opened on 5 August 1895, but has also been known as the Eton North State School. In the 2011 census, North Eton had a population of 536 people.

He was distinguished in the Battle of Nov≈°iƒáe where died.  Family  He was born in 1832 in Plav. His father Ferr Duri descended from the Kuƒçi tribe. His great‚Äîgreat-grandfather Gjergj Prentashi with his brother had left Kuci for Podgorica and then settled in Plav, where they converted to Islam. His great- grandfather Shab had two sons Halil and Dur. In turn, Dur had two sons Hajro and Ferr, the father of Jakup Ferri. He had three brothers Zeqo, Shaqir and Beqir, who died in the battle of Novsice. His mother was Zyl Rexha. At the age of 25, Jakup Ferri was married to Pemba, a cousin of Ali Pasha of Gusinje. He had five sons (Hasan, Mehmed, Omer, Agan, Emin) and three daughters (Kushe, Bardhoke, Zadeja). His descendants in Montenegro had to adopt the surname Feroviƒá. In time, they were able to revert to the original surname. His son Hasan Ferri (1860‚Äì1946) fought together with his father in this battle. In WWII, the Ferri family largely supported Balli Komb√´tar and organizations adjacent to it like the Second League of Prizren. Jakup Ferri's grandson Riza (son of Mehmed) was prefect of Dibra in WWII during the annexation of that area in Albania. He committed suicide in Shkod√´r in 1945 at the eve of his extradition to Yugoslavia, where he was to be tried for war crimes. In wartime, his other grandson, Shemsi (son of Agan) was the prefect of Plav and a delegate of the Second League of Prizren for that area. The participation of the Ferri family in Balli Komb√´tar - a largely anti-communist organization - was cause for Jakup Ferri's exclusion in much of post-war historiography in the People's Republic of Albania about the Albanian National Awakening. In 1979, in the 100th anniversary of the creation the League of Prizren with the personal intervention of Mehmet Shehu, Jakup Ferri was excluded from the list of those who were honored as \\"Heroes of the Nation\\" (Hero i Kombit). After 1990, the historical rehabilitation of Jakup Ferri and his son began and they were honored for their service to the nation.  Battle of Nov≈°iƒáe  He was an active insurgent against the Montenegrin annexation of Plav and Gusinje after 1878. He joined the League of Prizren, established after the Congress of Berlin (1878) that ceded Plav and Gusinje to Montenegro. In 1878, together with many other fighters from Gjakova, they assassinated the Ottoman general Mehmet Ali Pasha who had been sent to pacify the region and force the locals to accept the decisions of the Great Powers. In the autumn of 1879 notables of Plav and Gusinje established the local Committee of National Salvation. One its first decisions concerned the diversion to the war effort of all taxes that had been collected and the support of the troops with resources. Jakup Ferri was responsible in the region for the organization of the war effort and its resources.: \\"Prva odluka novoformiranog Komiteta odnosila se na slanje Jakupa Feroviƒáa meƒëu susjedna albanska plemena da ih obavijesti o opasnostima koje su se nadvile nad Plavom i Gusinjem, o odluci naroda ovih karajeva da brane ove domove i da se albanskim prvacima u ime graƒëana ovih krajeva ponudi savez o zajedniƒçkoj odbrani, prihvatajuƒái smje≈°taj i ishranu njihovih dobrovoljaca. Uz to, odluƒçeno je da Jakup Feroviƒá ponese sa sobom sva raspolo≈æiva novƒçana sredstva plavskog vakufa koja su se odnosila na sakupljene prihode po osnovu kori≈°tenja ispa≈°e na plavskim planinama, koja su bila dosta znaƒçajna, te da sa ovim sredstvima nagradi albanske prvake kako bi ih lak≈°e privolio da prihvate ovu saradnju.\\" Ali Pasha of Gusinje, the leader of the League, appointed him commander for the defence of Plav. He commanded his forces in the retreat from the Montenegrin assaults and managed to cut off the Montenegrins when they counter-attacked. Jakup Ferri fell at the beginning of the Battle of Nov≈°iƒáe, which ended in a victory for the League. His actions in 1879 made him a hero of Albanian and Bosniak folk poetry together with Ali Pasha Gucia. In literature, Jakup Ferri is a central character in Gjergj Fishta's The Highland Lute in the chapters (kang√´) about the defense of Plav against Montenegro.

Geography  Goondi is riverside land wrapped around the southern side of an elbow-shaped bend in the Johnstone River. It is very flat land, being 0 to 10 metres above sea level, and is predominantly used for growing sugar cane and bananas. Reid Creek flows from the north-east of the locality from neighbouring Sundown though to the Johnstone River in the north of the locality. There is very little residential development in Goondi. The Bruce Highway passes from south to north through the south-western edge of Goondi crossing the Johnstone River at the Sir Joseph McAvoy Bridge, while the North Coast railway line travels from south to north along Goondi's north-eastern border and crosses the Johnstone River. There is a private cane train tramway in the west of the locality, used to transport harvested sugar cane to the local sugar mill.  History  Goondi Wharf on the Johnstone River, circa 1885 The name \\"Goondi' is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning \\"elbow\\", referring to the bend in the river.

In the book, Unger identifies problems with contemporary leftism and proposes a way to achieve the goals that he believes should be central to the progressive cause: inclusive economic growth through the heating up of politics and democratizing the market economy, a relentless process of institutional innovation that depends less upon crisis for change, and depends more on shortening the distance between context-preserving and context-transforming moves. The Left Alternative was first published in 2006 as What Should the Left Propose? Overview In The Left Alternative, Unger describes the situation of the world today as a \\"dictatorship of no alternatives\\": a condition in which in the world seems to offer few alternatives for lifting the majority of people out of lives of poverty, drudgery, and belittlement. Progressives content themselves with \\"humanizing the inevitable,\\" merely softening the effects of existing institutions. Unger contends that there are fragments of alternatives being developed across the world, but these do not appeal to the West and often amount to \\"local heresies\\" that would not survive a sustained challenge. What Unger proposes is a \\"universalizing heresy\\"‚Äîa set of ideas that are rooted in an attempt to achieve economic growth with social inclusion, and comprehensive and general enough to apply across the world. Such an alternative, envisioned by this universalizing heresy, would describe a narrow gateway through which all societies must pass on the way to creating actual difference. Unger contends that the contemporary left is disoriented, bereft of any plausible or compelling alternatives to the neoliberal consensus that has gained in authority and influence in the rich western countries, and missing as well the ideas to support such an alternative, agents to advance the alternative, or a crisis that would be an impetus for adopting the alternative. But there is an alternative, Unger argues, one that would show how to combine both social inclusion and individual empowerment in political, economic and social institutions. This alternative would reshape production and politics, would refuse to see familiar forms of market economy, representative democracy and free civil society as necessary or canonical, would reject the contrast between market-oriented and command-economy solutions as a focus of ideological contests, would focus more on equality and inclusion within a setting of economic growth and technological innovation, than on increasing equality by redistribution through tax-and-transfer. The solution would democratize and radicalize the market economy by innovating in its arrangements and rethinking its logic. The overall aim of social policy would be to enhance individual capabilities through education and social inheritance, advance democratization of the market economy, and establish institutions of high-energy politics. The guiding philosophy of Unger's proposal, he explains, is \\"not the humanization of society; it is the divinization of humanity.\\" Unger sees this alternative as applicable across a broad range of richer and poorer societies, thus making possible a \\"universalizing heresy\\" that can oppose the universalizing orthodoxy promulgated by the rich Western countries on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The agents of this program, Unger explains, are workers who want to be petty bourgeois, and nations that want to be different. The practice that has the most potential to spread the program throughout the world is \\"innovation- friendly cooperation,\\" a set of practices currently concentrated in the best firms and schools, that have been highly successful in spreading technological innovations across the globe. But rather than leaving the practice of innovation-friendly cooperation within the confines of a global network of elite firms and schools, Unger proposes that these practices be nurtured and extended with the assistance of government, extending the benefits of innovation-friendly cooperation to classes and communities that have traditionally been excluded from these benefits. Unger sees this \\"left alternative\\" offering great potential for developing countries, in helping them achieve both national difference and prosperity for their citizens, while rejecting the neoliberal agenda that threatens to stifle real national difference as the price of entry into global markets. The left alternative offers a chance for European countries to reinvent and reinvigorate social democracy, which has gradually been stripped of programs that represented democracy's most ambitious hopes of fostering individual freedom, prosperity, and dignity. And Unger's proposal offers the United States a chance to enact a fitting sequel to the New Deal, the promise of which was betrayed by decades of misguided progressive policies that alienated a great many of leftism's natural constituency and undermining the attempt to form a trans-racial progressive majority. According to Unger, an insidious tendency in world politics has been the manner in which globalization, as it is currently practiced and proselytized, has become a \\"generic alibi for surrender\\" to the status quo, and a mechanism for suppression of promising political, economic, and social alternatives. Unger argues that the question should not be \\"how much globalization?\\" but rather \\"what manner of globalization?\\" The objective of Unger's progressive alternative is a \\"qualified pluralism: a world of democracies.\\" Unger concludes by describing two competing conceptions of the left. The first conception, the one that is preeminent today, is what Unger calls a \\"fake egalitarianism\\": an institutionally conservative leftism that is committed to greater equality of life chances, sought principally through redistributive tax-and-transfer. The second conception, the one for which Unger argues, is one that has the goal of making us bigger, both collectively and individually, and seeks equality only to the extent that inequality diminishes us and threatens us with indignity and privation. This second conception, rather than being institutionally conservative, would support a practice of institutional experimentation with the goal of democratizing the market, deepening democracy, and empowering individuals. Reception Reviewing The Left Alternative in the London Review of Books, Tom Nairn summarized Unger's ideas as follows: > Unger sets out the following key idea: ‚ÄòThe larger goal is a fuller > mobilisation of national resources: a war economy without a war‚Äô, fostering > ‚Äòthe institutions of a highenergy democracy‚Äô. Small nations can mean big, > even universal lives and ideas; but they will go on requiring ‚Äòa shield over > national heresy‚Äô, a fostering of it, a mobilisation of resources ‚Äòthat > allows petitioners to become rebels‚Äô.... His arguments are overwhelmingly > prescriptive lists of institutional changes that few will find undesirable > and fewer still could imagine being implemented in, say, Wales, Finland, > Kurdistan, Taiwan or Basra. While Nairn acknowledged the appeal of Unger's ideas, he concluded that the book was disappointingly general in its application: \\"Thinktank manifestos normally address a specific population in a specific tongue, before being translated (with appropriate changes) for others. But Unger‚Äôs are written in a synthetic fusion of legal American and Brazilian that seems to belong everywhere and nowhere.... Unger dwells on [a] weirdly anational plane.\\" Michael B. Mathias reviewed The Left Alternative in Marx and Philosophy. He wrote that The Left Alternative is \\"a concise introduction to [Unger's] recent thought, which has shifted towards a more pragmatic and centrist position. Unger‚Äôs basic aimhere is to emancipate the world from‚Äòthe dictatorship of no alternatives‚Äô by offering a constructive Leftist program.\\" Mathias was critical of the book's ambitions: \\"Unger certainly captures the dismay that many of us feel in the face of an implacable neoliberal orthodoxy and the constriction of human possibilities that it entails. And he offers a welldeserved rebuke to those on the Left who have become institutionally conservative in attitude and abandoned any transformative ambition. Nonetheless, what Unger characterizes as the ‚Äòfirst steps‚Äô in a new direction seemmore like giant leaps given the political realities that presently constrain opportunities for change.\\" Publishers Weekly called The Left Alternative a \\"stimulating visionary manifesto.\\" The review went on to offer a mixed assessment of the book: > Some readers will no doubt find his sweeping indictment of social democracy > unfair, his co-optation of avant-garde management theory naive, and his > celebration of change and upheaval utopian. Many of his proposals, like > privatizating social services or making everyone hold a second job in the > \\"\\"caring economy\\"\\" tending to the old, the young, the sick, the poor or the > desperate (no, family members don't count), are ill thought-out. Still, he > offers an incisive critique of social and economic discontents, one that > turns traditional Marxist formulations on their heads (\\"\\"we... are, in large > numbers, petty-bourgeois now.\\"\\") The result is a provocative challenge to > left orthodoxies that should spur plenty of controversy and fresh thinking. Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory reviewed the book as follows: \\"The Left Alternative‚Äîpreviously named What Should the Left Propose? (2005)‚Äîpresents itself as a proposal for the Left to change the world and offers many crucial ‚Äòdirections‚Äô to the Left in order to achieve genuine democracy.\\" The review concludes that \\"this book provides some interesting proposals to change the world. However, the author does not entirely deny the existing economic and political systems but attempts to reform, reshape and improve them. This book should be recommended to anyone who questions the legitimacy of the capitalist world and to those who have faith in the idea that ‚Äòanother world is possible‚Äô.\\" See alsoEmpowered democracy *Participatory economics References Sources   * Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Books in political philosophy Category:Political science books Category:Books about democracy Category:Neoliberalism Category:Books about globalization Category:Critical legal studies Category:English-language books Category:Books by Roberto Mangabeira Unger ","title":"The Left Alternative"},{"id":"48975034","text":"William Mortimer (1841/42‚Äì1913) was an architect working in Lincoln from around 1858.

His attempt has been documented by the Discovery Channel and was cited in an episode of Tosh.0.

He later used a Schumacher Mi3 as a base, the car powered by a R/C aircraft motor and a 12-cell battery pack. The car also had a four-wheel drive system of his own design for improved traction and his own tires, which were vulcanized to the aluminum rims, to improve airflow underneath the vehicle. To prevent the car from flipping over, he added a gyroscope steering-correction system from radio-controlled helicopters. The car took six months to build, at a cost of $4,000. This paid off at the ISC Speed Run event in Rockingham Dragway, Rockingham, North Carolina, on October 4, 2008, where the car reached a speed of Case made another attempt in 2011 when he collaborated with Associated Electrics, which built him a Team Associated SR11.

Unable to bring this any further, and leaving his new record unconfirmed, he briefly retired when his 17-year-old nephew was killed in a hit and run accident.

From 1708 to 1717 he studied seamanship in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In 1717 he returned to Russia and participated in the Great Northern War, during which he distinguished himself in the Battle of Grengam, commanding a detachment of rowing fleet that defeated a Swedish squadron. In 1726 he became an advisor to the Board of Admiralty and was made a Lieutenant commander. In 1728 he became privy councilor and senator, and in 1727 he was named president of the College of Justice. Together with his brother, also Mikhail Mikhailovitch, he participated in the events surrounding the coronation of Empress Anna Ivanovna. In 1732 he returned to the navy with the rank of vice admiral but in 1741 Empress Elizabeth came to the throne and he was recalled to politics, again becoming a privy councilor in 1745.

He was the first holder of the office of Third Serjeant- at-law, which was created especially for him, supposedly as a \\"consolation prize\\" for not being made a High Court judge the first time he sought that office. Early career He was born in Carrickfergus, son of Captain Roger Lyndon, Collector of Customs for the town of Carrickfergus, and his wife Jane Marten. The Lyndons were a prominent Carrickfergus family who settled there in the 1590s, though John's own descendants were very much associated with Dublin. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1657. He was appointed Recorder of Carrickfergus and entered the King's Inn in 1663. He was seneschal of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Killybegs in the sole Irish Parliament of the reign of Charles II (1661-1666). The first Third Serjeant The office of Third Serjeant was created especially for him in 1682: this was widely regarded as a \\"consolation prize\\" for his failure to secure a place on the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). The situation became comical when the office of Second Serjeant was given to William Beckett: both Lyndon and Sir Richard Ryves, the Recorder of Dublin, claimed that it had been promised to them. Ormonde, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, took a keen interest in judicial appointments, but he did not regard the Serjeant-at-law as an office of much importance (probably due to his deep distrust of Sir Audley Mervyn, who had been the Prime Serjeant in the 1660s). He frankly admitted that when he appointed Beckett as Serjeant he had forgotten that Lyndon had already received his patent of appointment to the same office. A compromise arrangement was reached by which Beckett remained as Second Serjeant; he died only a few months later. Ryves was promised, and received, the next vacant Serjeantship, and Lyndon, in addition to becoming Third Serjeant, was promised the next vacant seat on the High Court bench. The desire to conciliate Lyndon suggests that he was highly regarded by Ormonde, who was noted for loyalty to his friends. No specific duties were assigned to him as Third Serjeant, and the office was generally agreed to be surplus to requirements, at a time when the need for even two serjeants was questioned, not least by Ormonde himself. Judge Ormonde kept his promise, and In January 1683 Lyndon was raised to the Bench as justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He was sent regularly to Ulster as justice of assize. In 1686-7 he was engaged in a dispute with his colleague Thomas Nugent as to which of them had precedence in Court: they are said to have quarrelled \\"as briskly as two women\\". He seems to have been in some financial difficulty at this time, as he petitioned the Crown for a licence to export wool, as a means of providing for his family. The Glorious Revolution and afterwards Although Lyndon was a sincere Protestant, (being a friend of Ormonde, he was most likely a staunch Anglican), the Catholic King James II, despite his policy of replacing Irish Protestant office-holders with Catholics in so far as possible, left Lyndon in peace until after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. James's arrival in Ireland in 1689 put Lyndon and the other remaining Protestants on the Irish Bench in a very difficult position, as they were naturally suspected of sympathising with the new King William III. Lyndon and his wife tried to escape to England, taking their valuables with them, but they were arrested at the waterside and their goods were seized. His enemies claimed that Lyndon then agreed to preside at the trials of suspected enemies of the Jacobite regime, as a bribe for the return of his property, and he did resume his position as justice of assize in Ulster for a time. Later in 1689 he and his family were permitted to go to England, but without their valuables. His position on the Bench was left vacant, apparently because no barrister would pay the fee for the patent of office. Following the downfall of King James's cause at the Battle of the Boyne, Lyndon returned to Ireland, and was reappointed to the Bench in 1690 and knighted. He continued to go regularly on assize to Ulster. He died in 1699. Family By his wife Elizabeth he had a numerous family, including at least five sons- John, Edward, Charles, Richard and George, and one daughter, who married her cousin Cuthbert Winder. Lady Lyndon died in June 1711, a fact mentioned by Jonathan Swift in a letter to his beloved friend Esther Johnson (Stella) : \\"your Lady Lyndon is dead\\". Their eldest son, Captain John Lyndon, was killed at the Siege of Limerick (1691). ReferencesBall, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 *Hart, A.R.

Along with the Battle of Gondar, it marked the end of the conventional warfare phase of the East Africa Campaign. Background In 1941, following the Italian defeats at Keren and Amba Alagi, military operations in Italian East Africa moved towards the Amhara region, where General Guglielmo Nasi had organised his defence on the main stronghold of Gondar and a series of secondary strongholds around it. The surrounding terrain was characterised by irregular heights, with flat or conical summits (ambas), intersected by deep ravines that were hardly traversable on foot. Here, the key point for the whole defence system was located in the Culqualber Pass, where passed a rough road, that was the only available route for Commonwealth forces, which headed towards Gondar with artillery and armoured units. Preparations On 6 August 1941, Nasi sent a mixed force to guard Culqualber Pass. The force included the 1st Carabinieri Mobilized Group, with two companies of Italian veterans (200 men) and one company of Zapti√© (160 men) under the command of Colonel Augusto Ugolini and Major Alfredo Serranti; the CCXL Blackshirt Battalion (five companies), with 675 blackshirts under Seniore (Major) Alberto Cassoli and the LXVII Colonial Battalion (four companies), with 620 askaris under Major Carlo Garbieri. The garrison was completed by two artillery batteries, the 43rd (three old 77/28 mm guns and 40 Italian gunners) and the 44th (two 70/15 mm howitzers and 34 Eritrean artillerymen); a platoon of engineers, with 88 men (65 Italians and 23 askaris) and a field hospital, with two medics and a chaplain. The five guns available were obsolete and dated back to World War I, the howitzers being war prizes from the Austro-Hungarian Army. The garrison was also joined by a small number of askaris from Debra Tabor; when that garrison surrendered in July 1941, some ascaris had refused surrender and undertook a march towards Culqualber. One of them, Muntaz Unat√π Endisciau, was captured by Ethiopian guerrillas, escaped, was mortally wounded while crossing a minefield and died after having his battalion's banner delivered to the Italian garrison. Endisciau was one of the two colonial soldiers who were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. The Italian and colonial forces at Culqualber Pass numbered about 2,100 men overall. A secondary stronghold was at Fercaber Pass, near Lake Tana, with the XIV Blackshirt Battalion (five companies and 600 men, under Seniore Lasagni), the 1st Artillery Battery (three 70/15 mm howitzers and about 30 Italian gunners), the 6th Colonial Machine Gunners Company (130 askaris), a platoon of engineers, a medical officer and a military chaplain. The garrison of Fercaber consisted in 800 men. In addition to the soldiers, about 200 African women and children were at Culqualber and Fercaber; they were the wives and children of the askaris, whom, following their custom, had followed their husbands and supported them. After ascertaining the situation, the Carabinieri command decided to entrench its troops on the \\"Costone dei Roccioni\\", an overhanging ridge that dominated both the road to Gondar on the north, and the Dessie-Debra Tabor side on the south (with the \\"Km. 39 Spur\\"). The command was placed in barycentric position. During the subsequent weeks, the Italians fortified their positions (especially on the Costone, which lacked any kind of fortifications) by using the trunks of the trees found in the ravines. Caverns with multiple embrasures were dug in the rock of the ridge, to allow to fire in all directions. Some tractors and caterpillars were turned into improvised armoured fighting vehicles, armed with Schwarzlose machine guns and Fiat 35 machine guns. Siege Beginning on the end of August, Ethiopian irregulars started ambushes aimed at cutting communications and supply lines between Gondar and Culqualber. Ugolini ordered some sorties in retaliation. On 4 September, some askari and blackshirt companies made a nocturnal sortie and attacked the Ethiopian encampment, capturing a large quantity of weapons and ammunition. The British forces retaliated with a heavy bombardment of the Italian positions. During September the Commonwealth forces, coming from south and readying for the attack, positioned themselves along the Guarn√≤ river and on the Danguri√® heights, directly threatening the \\"Km. 39 Spur\\" positions. By then the Carabinieri defensive preparations were completed but the inflow of Commonwealth forces in the Gumera valley isolated the garrison of Culqualber from the rest of the Italian defence system, thus starting the siege. At first the British forces tested the Italian defensive perimeter with patrol actions, then, after ascertaining the reaction, they advanced on the flanks, avoiding battle and encircling both Culqualber and Fercaber. The encirclement of the Italians on Culqualber Pass was complete; their supply lines were cut off and they soon found themselves in hardships, having to ration their food stores; often the only meal consisted in bargutta, a gross flour obtained from corn, fodder and quadruped feed. The lack of drinking water posed a more serious problem; after the Commonwealth forces secured their control over the Guarn√≤ and Gumer√†, the two rivers which provided water to the Italians, the only water source for the garrison became a small spring, whose flow rate was insufficient for their needs. Carabinieri attempted to reach the rivers several times to retrieve some water but they became easy targets for the British fire, which caused heavy losses. A method for obtaining small quantities of water consisted in spreading towels on the ground at night and retrieving them in the morning, when they were wet, thanks to high nocturnal humidity. The Italians were aware that, as time passed, they would grow weaker and weaker, while the besiegers strengthened their forces; from mid-October they therefore organised a series of sorties aimed at both lightening British pressure on their stronghold, and capturing weapons and foodstuffs. =Amba Mariam= The first Italian sortie (and also the most important and bloodiest one), took place on 18 October and was directed against a position on the Amba Mariam height, north of Culqualber, where the besiegers had placed encampments and logistic depots. The sortie succeeded, allowing the Carabinieri, Zapti√® and the 4th Company of LXVII Colonial Battalion (Sub-Lieutenant Giovanni Pinat) to inflict heavy losses and to capture a considerable amount of weapons, ammunition and foodstuffs; exploiting their initial success, the Carabinieri and colonials then carried out a bayonet charge and overran the British defenders, which withdrew from Amba Mariam. Colonel Ugolini then ordered Major Serranti to secure the newly captured positions of Amba Mariam with the men who had carried out the attack; Ugolini then led Zapti√® in pursuit of the retreating British defenders, pushing them beyond the Gumera river. The British forces soon launched a powerful counter-attack from east; Serranti's men resisted till the return of Ugolini, then they retreated from Amba Mariam and returned to their lines, bringing with them their wounded and their booty of weapons, ammunition and food. 36 Italians and colonials were killed and 31 wounded in the fight for Amba Mariam, whereas Allied casualties amounted to 150‚Äì200 men. This operation temporarily lightened the British pressure on Culqualber and provided the Italians with food and supplies that allowed them to lighten the rationing and to prolong their resistance. =British counter-offensive= During the following days, the British commander, Brigadier General Colin Frederick Blackden, increased his forces in the area, transferring there several armoured units, some thousands British soldiers and several thousands Ethiopian irregulars. Italian positions were heavily bombarded with both aircraft and artillery and the Allied also started actions of psychological warfare, dropping leaflets with demands to surrender, sending Copt priests to persuade the defenders to surrender, and sending messengers who also asked for surrender, until Serranti threatened to fire on them. Ground attacks and air strikes escalated from 21 October. The Allied enjoyed complete air domination; only two Fiat CR.42 were left to face about a hundred aircraft of the Royal Air Force and South African Air Force which continuously bombed and strafed the Italian positions. One of the two CR.42s, piloted by Sub-Lieutenant Ildebrando Malavolta, was engaged over Culqualber by two Gloster Gladiator and shot down by Lieutenant Lancelot Charles Henry Hope (3rd Squadron SAAF) on 24 October. A heavy assault was attempted against the northern defences (manned by the 3rd Company of the CCXL Blackshirt Battalion and by the 2nd Carabinieri Battalion); the Italian lines ceded in some points but these were immediately recaptured by Italian and colonial counter-attacks. =November= A series of new Allied attacks were launched during November 1941: On 2 November, a bombing destroyed the Italian field hospital, hitting also the cemetery. Three days later, a heavy Commonwealth-Ethiopian attack on the southern side of the stronghold was halted by the 1st Carabinieri Company, supported by artillery. During the night of 12 November, a new strong British assault began, this time after some heavy bombings, a series of assaults were launched all day on 13 November. The battle often turned into hand-to-hand combat, and the Italian defenders repelled the Uollo irregulars and the Kikuyu and Sudanese irregulars towards the ravines of \\"Costone dei Roccioni\\". The battle ended in the evening with the failure of the Commonwealth attack. On 14 November the Allied attacks paused, and the Italians exploited this break to care for the wounded, bury the dead, and have their first hot meal in days. Between 15 and 19 November the RAF and SAAF constantly bombed the Italian positions, and the ground forces renewed their attacks (on 18 November, the Italian anti-aircraft guns claimed nine aircraft shot down); British forces managed to capture some positions, which were however recaptured by Carabinieri and Zapti√® in hand-to- hand combat. Italian volunteers made some infiltration actions to lower the pressure of the attacks. =Final assault and fall= Starting on 18 November, bombings on Culqualber and Fercaber were further intensified. On 20 November, the Italian positions were bombed by 57 aircraft, and an Allied force of about 22,500 men, supported by armoured units, was prepared for the final assault. The Allied forces attacking from the north were three battalions of the King's African Rifles (25th East African Brigade), several machine gun companies, six artillery batteries, a Sudanese company and about 6,500 Ethiopian irregulars, for a total of 13,000 men under Brigadier W. A. L. James. The forces attacking from the south numbered about 9,500 men under Lieutenant Colonel Collins, consisting of two South African battalions, a Gold Coast artillery battery with six guns, a South African battery, several machine gun companies and about 3,500 Ethiopian irregulars. The Italian garrison, after the losses suffered in the previous months, were down to 1,500‚Äì1,600 soldiers and officers still able to fight. The attack started at 03:00 on 21 November. Allied forces attacked from three sides, with infantry supported by tanks (including Mk III light tanks of the South African Light Armoured Detachment), artillery fire and air strikes. Both on \\"Km. 39 Spur\\", defended by the 1st Carabinieri Company, and on the less defendable \\"Costone dei Roccioni\\" (where fortifications were weaker), held by the 2nd Carabinieri Company, fierce hand- to-hand combat erupted between attackers and defenders. Carabinieri fought with bayonets and hand grenades when they ran out of ammunition, and they counterattacked numerous times to recapture lost positions, but both battalions were annihilated, as was the Blackshirt battalion of Major Cassoli. The three Italian battalion commanders, Garbieri, Serranti and Cassoli, were all killed in the fighting. Aftermath The battle ended in the evening of 21 November 1941, with the capture of Culqualber by the Allied forces. Gondar fell less than a week later, thus ending the last organised resistance by Italian regular units in East Africa. Of the 2,900 men of the garrisons of Culqualber and Fercarber, 513 Italians and 490 Askaris were killed and 404 Italians and 400 Askaris were wounded. About 100 of the 200 wives and children of the Askaris lost their lives. All the survivors, including Ugolini, were taken prisoner. Commonwealth and Ethiopian losses are not known. The Corps of Carabinieri was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor for its role in the defence of Culqualber.

It was built in 1918. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This memorial is unusual in that it is dedicated to the memory of an individual soldier. It marks the death on 12 October 1917 of Lieutenant Thomas Acheson (Tom) Armstrong of the 33rd Battalion who was killed in action at the age of 26 at the First Battle of Passchendaele at Zonnebeke near Passchendaele, Flanders during the First World War. Prior to enlisting at the start of 1916, Armstrong was a medical student at the University of Sydney. Armstrong's family lived on a farm between Marian and Mirani. The memorial was erected behind the altar at St James Presbyterian Church (later Uniting Church) at Marian, a timber church located on Anzac Avenue near the Marian sugar mill. The mason who created the memorial is unknown. It was mounted behind the pulpit on the northern side of the church. The memorial was unveiled in a ceremony on Saturday 14 September 1918 by Major Stuart Key. After the unveiling, a bugler played the Last Post, followed by a brief silence and then the congregation sang God Save the King. By 1991 the church was no longer in use and it was proposed that the Marian State School purchase the site for its use. Local church services were relocated to St Stephens Uniting Church at the nearby township of Mirani and the memorial was transferred from St James church to St Stephens, Mirani. Thomas Armstrong was also memorialised at the Menin Gate Memorial at Ypres, Belgium, where memorialisation is reserved for Commonwealth soldiers of World War I whose graves cannot be identified.  Description  Memorial is within St Stephen's Uniting Church, Mirani, 2009 The memorial is a tablet of black polished stone, measuring and forms the base for two white marble reliefs. The lower one is in the form of a scroll and sword and has the inscription: > In Loving Memory of Lieut Thomas A Armstrong 33rd Battalion AIF who was > killed in action near Passchendaele, Flanders on 12th October 1917 aged 26 > years. Greater love hath no man than this. The upper white marble relief bears the crest of the 33rd Battalion in polychrome and its Latin motto, Strenue Percute (translated strike vigorously).  Heritage listing  Lt Thomas Armstrong Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Armstrong Memorial is important is demonstrating the pattern and evolution of Queensland's history, as a memorial to the participation and death in battle of a member of the Marian community in the First World War. In its depiction of martial symbols such as the sword and battalion crest, it reflects a pride in Australia's participation in the war as a nation within the Empire as well as personal loss. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Armstrong Memorial is rare in Queensland as a privately erected war memorial to an individual soldier. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Armstrong memorial has aesthetic value as a well designed and good quality war memorial publicly displayed in the church.

History With the implementation of Variante de Po√° in 1926, many industries installed in the Aracar√© region like Rendal - Ind√∫strias de Renda Ltda and Lanif√≠cio √çtamo Adami S/A. This way, a halt named Aracar√© was built in the 1940s to attend the factories' workers. On 20 August 1950, the new halt was promoted to station by Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil, receiving new installations and kept the name Aracar√©. With the opening of the new station, imobiliary companies launched projects Vila Erc√≠lia and Vila Aracar√©, changing the region's profile from few industries to populated residential boroughs. Yet, the movement of the station was low, with an average of 900 passengers boarding daily in the station in 1975. After being transferred from RFFSA to CBTU in 1984, Aracar√© station went to reform to expand its platform in the following year, so it can allow the operation of trains with 9 to 12 cars. Besides the platform expansion, the cover of the same was not executed. On 1 June 1984, the station was transferred to CPTM. Because of the infrastructure and lack of accessibility, the station became target of many complaints from commuters. Another problem was the gap between the train and the platform. With , above the limited by ABNT-NBR 14021, Aracar√© has the largest gap in the CPTM. Besides the promises of reform or modernization, no work was done until then. =Projects= On 12 April 2005, CPTM opened the bidding no. 8292402011, predicting project of modernization/rebuilt of 39 station divided in 10 allotments. Aracar√© station was included in allotment 9, along with stations Engenheiro Goulart, S√£o Miguel Paulista, Itaquaquecetuba and Engenheiro Manoel Feio. Allotment 9 was won by consortium Vetec/Trends by the cost of 777,177 BRL ( USD). The consortium hired the Una Arquitetos office. The proposal of reconstruction predicted the displacement of the station to south of the current location, making the station going from Itaquaquecetuba to Po√°. The proposal of changing of localization of the station was contested by the population and Itaquaquecetuba politicians, being archived. Later, a new project for modernization of the station was hired along with GPO Sistran, but no work was made until then. After the Information Requirement no. 254/2019, made by State Deputy M√¥nica Seixas (PSOL), CPTM published a schedule of investments predicted and done for the making of the reconstruction of the station.

It was compounded by political factors as a result of the 2015 Nepal blockade. Victims of the earthquakes were still living in flimsy, temporary shelters more than a year after the initial devastation. The governmental National Reconstruction Authority had not devised relocation plans for these people as recently as July 2016. In Sindhupalchok District, the region that had suffered the worst devastation, the humanitarian situation was a little better towards the end of 2016 than it had been in 2015. Development indicators dropped with the passage of time. Nepal had ranked among the countries that had seen remarkable development gains pre-quake; post-quake reversal of gains led to around 43% of the urban population lacking access to even a decent toilet. It has been reported that one of the primary reasons for girls dropping out or irregularly attending school was the lack of toilets. Announcement In early November 2015, the US embassy sounded the warning of a humanitarian crisis evolving in Nepal. The issue of post-quake vulnerability somehow dissipated during the increasingly vocal information war between Kathmandu and New Delhi, which witnessed public denouncements at various United Nations offices. Soon UNICEF followed with a warning echoing statements previously made by the US embassy. Ethnic Angle The most ignored communities were Nepali Indians, living in the most inaccessible regions of Nepal, clinging to high mountain passes. They have yet to see any quake aid from Kathmandu, while the relief effort focuses on the immediate needs of people in the vicinity of cities. The areas of Nepal hardest-hit by the earthquake, such as Gorkha District, Sindhupalchowk District and Dolakha District, where 90% of houses were destroyed, are likely to suffer most as Kathmandu historically has shown very little interest in them, and transport must be by mule in treacherous mountainous terrain as no roads exist. In particular, Tamang and Chepang children were already suffering from severe malnutrition before the fuel crisis, and they were worst off. Having waited until winter is in full swing, the government in Kathmandu, finally gearing for action in December, realized that it could not efficiently deliver supplies to remote locations without helicopters. By Christmas 2015, snow had already fallen in many parts of the country. In total, an estimated 600,000 homes were destroyed in the earthquake (with no donated money reaching any survivors as of 9 November). These and similar predominately Mongoloid groups that inhabit high mountain homelands are known to international tourists and trekkers through trekking circuits, where the experiences of them sharing their homes and hospitality are an integral part of the trekking experience. However, these very same people are the most vulnerable within Nepal due to their remoteness, post-quake effects, weak political representation, low caste, and the altitude and climate. Goma BK of the Gagal Bhadaure Village Development Committee(VDC)-9, Ramechhap, said that she was unable to get find one kilogram of rice or one tarpaulin even after walking four hours daily for six days. Rajendra Nepali of Bhimeshwor Municipality-6, Dolakha, said that Dalits were excluded during the relief effort because their settlements are located in remote areas and lack access to information. Humanitarian access Humanitarian access to survivors has been lacking, other than the UNHAS air drops, as the government had seized ad- hoc post-quake efforts and resources within the month after the initial quake. This situation did not improve even with the new government of KP Oli in October. Only after widespread criticism and warnings of impending doom did the government break the logjam and appoint the reconstruction authority head on 25 December, who now has the task of racing against time to begin reconstruction. Crisis Intensification =Winter Onset= Despite the first politically unified government since before the Nepalese Civil War, no action has been taken in the month since Cabinet endorsed an action plan for releasing grant assistance meant for houses destroyed by the 25 April earthquake. On 26 November, some 600 children in Gorkha District were diagnosed with malnutrition. In a normal winter the prior year, without quakes or fuel shortages, an estimated 5,000 children died from pneumonia exacerbated by indoor pollution from firewood used to keep warm. These numbers were expected to rise sharply in the winter of 2015. While long-promised legal traction in preparation for assistance has materialized, the first 2,000 families to receive money they can put to immediate use, collected it on 20 December from the Nepal Red Cross for emergency clothing and food. Many complained it is not enough to buy clothes for the entire family let alone any food. As the problems compound, some 3,300 people have been diagnosed with tuberculosis in the west as of 25 December, a region not affected by the quake.http://www.nepalnews.com/index.php/news/47050-around-3,000-tb-patients- found-in-far-western-region In a twist of irony, on 28 December, an ignored and very irritated group of quake survivors sent the Nepali government warm clothes as a symbolic protest. The UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) of copters, coordinated by the World Food Programme, has made 4,784 sorties in the eight months to remote areas. This has stopped for lack of funds, with the last delivery made on 31 December just as the worst of winter cold sets in, and confirmation of disease and death from lack of food in villages makes headlines in earnest. The first 3 billion rupees was released by the Kathmandu government for warm clothing on 3 January 2016, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Despite an about turn regarding quake relief by the central government of Nepal around Christmas and early January 2016, and one Army led relief to push into remote Gorkha during a blizzard, only one out of four villages received aid as helicopters had trouble landing. The Oli government began selling donated food meant for victims to raise money, instead of delivering the goods to survivors. This move was criticized by the independent Nepal Human Rights Commission. Additionally, the official launch of the reconstruction campaign resembled a religious ceremony rather than a relief mission. Additionally, even in the Madhesh plains town of Pokariya, which has a well-connected infrastructure compared to the Himalayas, some 26 people have died in two months, with major news outlets failing to report this. Some 400 health facilities were damaged or destroyed in the quake-hit mountain region. As of mid-February 2016, only one had been restored to operation, by an NGO not the government. =Ongoing Issues= Despite the first government relief actions and commitments, serious hurdles in execution] exist. The quake has not only destroyed homes but livelihoods. According to a news report, every needy family across the quake-hit Gorkha District seeking out a living with traditional occupations finds itself in the same kind of predicament‚Äîthe quake has destroyed their means of livelihood. Once self-sufficient communities have become entirely dependent on aid for survival, extreme depression (mood) is setting in. People are just not living well after the disastrous post-quake post-blockade winter. Stress-induced insomnia has become commonplace and chronic and that is wreaking social havoc. Water scarcity has hit 2.8 million people and over 5,200 drinking water projects. As of March 2016, some 325 water sources in 14 districts have gone dry. Reconstruction obstruction In a brief notice in early March 2016, the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) directed all relief agencies to stop reconstructing private homes destroyed or damaged in the earthquake for the 2.5 million survivors, without its approval. Although the intentions finally appeared humanitarian this time as to bring the ad hoc relief agencies into oversight, the timing (a year late and after the brutal winter) had rendered a swift and brutal reaction from relief agencies. Infighting between political parties had already led to the extended and bitterly cruel delay in NRA setup, along with the willful misleading of survivors regarding money to rebuild, and timeliness that only worsened the humanitarian situation, with no government clarification on this. Although the NRA issued a ban, it is clear that NGOs are not waiting, nor is the agency seriously seeking to stop them, as an NRA spokesperson stated: \\"We don‚Äôt mean to stop INGOs and NGOs from reconstruction projects, just to bring them under our jurisdiction.\\" The agency's response has been that they are understaffed and ministries are not cooperating nor attending their meetings. International reactions ‚Äì On 5 November 2015, the US expressed deep concern over the critical shortages of essential supplies in Nepal resulting from a volatile situation along the Nepal-India border. ‚Äì On 26 November 2015, United Nations Development Programme resident senior economist Basudeb Guha- Khasnobis stated: \\"What could have been transient poverty is turning out to be structural poverty due to delay in reconstruction works.\\" UNICEF ‚Äì On 30 November, UNICEF stated ‚Äì \\"More than 3 million children under the age of 5 in Nepal are at risk of death or disease during the harsh winter months due to a severe shortage of fuel, food, medicines and vaccines.\\" World Food Programme ‚Äì On 11 December, UN WFP stated ‚Äì \\"Major disruptions in food and fuel imports across its southern border with India have severely affected Nepal‚Äôs supplies and caused a worrying increase in food prices.\\" See alsoMadhes Movement *Anti-Indian sentiment *Human rights in Nepal External links Homeless in winter, Earthquake survivors are desperate, but the government is not (Nepali Times) * Chepangs in Lothhar fight cold with donated clothes (Kathmandu Post photo feature) * Nepal's Gurung Community Says Goodbye To A Trying Year (NPR) References Category:2015 in Nepal Category:2016 in Nepal Category:2017 in Nepal 2015 2015 ","title":"Nepal humanitarian crisis (2015-2017)"},{"id":"48975416","text":"Kangyang station is a railway station in Ons≈èng County, North Hamgy≈èng, North Korea, on the Hambuk Line of the Korean State Railway.

This photo reconnaissance sortie returned with 7000 photographs which helped with planning air raids on Japan during the last months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to shoot down the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude at which it operated. Background In late 1944 the United States Twentieth Air Force's XXI Bomber Command prepared to conduct strategic bombing raids on the Japanese home islands from bases in the Mariana Islands. These attacks were to replace the largely unsuccessful Operation Matterhorn raids which had been conducted by XX Bomber Command aircraft based in India and staging through bases in China since June 1944. While XX Bomber Command conducted photo reconnaissance sorties over Japan as part of this effort, the aircraft flying from China lacked the range to reach Japan's main industrial centers. Without photographic intelligence XXI Bomber Command was unable to develop detailed plans for raids against its intended targets. On 10 October 1944 the Committee of Operations Analysts, which provided advice to USAAF commanders on suitable strategic bombardment targets, recommended that photo reconnaissance flights be conducted over Japan's main industrial areas as soon as possible to provide intelligence which could be used to direct raids from the Mariana Islands. These operations were to be conducted by the 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron (3d PRS), which was the only photo reconnaissance unit in the XXI Bomber Command. The 3d PRS had been formed on 10 June 1941. After conducting flights over the Americas, it was deployed to the China-Burma-India Theater. The unit flew mapping missions over the region from 10 December 1943 until it was disbanded and re-formed in the United States during April 1944 to be equipped with the new F-13 photo reconnaissance variant of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber. Due to delays to the development of the F-13, the 3d PRS was unable to commence training on the type until 24 August, and began to receive its first operational F-13s on 4 October. 3d PRS F-13s began to depart for Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 19 October, where they would be supported by the unit's ground echelon which had arrived on 18 September. Photo reconnaissance sortie The first two 3d PRS F-13s arrived at Saipan on 30 October after a 33-hour flight from Mather Field in California via Oahu and Kwajalein. While the commander of the XXI Bomber Command, Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell, encouraged the exhausted airmen to rest, they insisted on conducting a flight over Japan as soon as possible. At 5.55 am on 1 November an F-13 whose crew was led by Captain Ralph D. Steakley took off from Saipan bound for Japan. Weather conditions over Tokyo were perfect for photo reconnaissance, with the skies free of clouds. Flying at , Steakley's aircraft repeatedly passed over a complex of aircraft and engine plants to the west of Tokyo, before moving on to photograph a similar facility near the city of Nagoya. Overall, the American airmen took 7,000 photos during the mission. While most of the photos of Tokyo were of industrial areas, the aircraft also photographed the densely populated urban areas of the city which were firebombed later in the war. Steakley was surprised to encounter strong winds, and reported that his ground speed over Tokyo was sometimes only about . The jet stream over this region was not known to the USAAF at the time, and greatly complicated XXI Bomber Command's later air raids. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service's 47th Sentai provided fighter cover for Tokyo on 1 November. The unit's Nakajima Ki-44 fighters began to take off from Narimasu airfield to intercept the F-13 at 1 pm. These aircraft were not designed to be used at high altitudes, and the Japanese airmen were unable to get closer than about from Steakley's aircraft. Two formations of fighters fired machine guns at the F-13, but did not hit it. Several batteries of Japanese anti-aircraft guns also unsuccessfully fired on the American aircraft. The F-13 was the first American aircraft to fly over Tokyo since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, and was seen by many Japanese civilians. Its presence over the city and the failure of the military to shoot it down increased the concerns many had over the course of the war. Aftermath The F-13 returned to Saipan after a 14-hour flight. By the next day the crew had named the aircraft \\"Tokyo Rose\\" in reference to the propaganda broadcaster. Steakley received the Distinguished Flying Cross for the flight, and the other members of the crew were also later decorated. It took weeks to process all of the photographs and months to fully analyse them. The photographs taken during the sortie were an important source of intelligence for the Twentieth Air Force and other American units, especially as 1 November proved to be the only day of the air campaign against Japan in which weather conditions over the home islands were entirely clear of cloud. Hansell later said the sortie had been probably the greatest single contribution to the air war with Japan. The 3d PRS flew 16 more sorties over Japan before XXI Bomber Command's first raid against Tokyo on 24 November, but several of these missions were frustrated by bad weather. One F-13 was lost during a mission to Nagoya on 21 November, but the squadron had nine aircraft at Saipan by the end of the month. The 3d PRS continued to fly reconnaissance sorties over Japan until the end of the war.

The film is a spin-off to the 2012 film Saattai and the second installment in the film series. The film features Samuthirakani and Thambi Ramaiah reprising their roles from the previous film, while Namo Narayanan, Vignesh and Nasath play supporting roles. Featuring music composed by Ilaiyaraaja, the film began production in late 2015 and continued till March 2016. The film was released on 1 July 2016. The film was remade in Malayalam as Aakashamittayi (2017) with Jayaram playing the main lead. Plot Dhayalan (Samuthirakani), Singaperumal (Thambi Ramaiah) and Nadunilayan (Namo Narayana) live in the same community in a town near Neyveli, Tamil Nadu. They are expecting the arrivals of their respective children and they all have different perspectives in child rearing. Dhayalan makes his wife to go for a traditional delivery at home, while Singaperumal instructs the doctor to perform a C-section on a scheduled date and time, in order for his child to have the best possible horoscope, pre-calculated based on the date and time of birth. All three of them have baby boys. Dhayalan names his son Vetriswaran, Singaperumal names his son Chakravarthy, and Nadunilayan names his son Mayilvaganam. Trouble brews at Dhayalan's home, when he refuses to put his son at the age of two in a play school. Dhayalan's wife wants their child to be sent to a specific play school since the other children in the neighbourhood are being enrolled there and is considered prestigious. Dhayalan's view is that the toddler need to enjoy his childhood by playing and learning and join a school at the age of 5. But after a heated argument, Dhayalan's wife attempts suicide for this and he agrees against his conscience and enrols their son in the play school. As the boys grow, their fathers imbue different social aspects into their children. Dhayalan teaches his son to be friendly to society, trust people, enjoy every moment of life and do good to the community. He teaches his son to follow a path of truth and integrity, considering human values above everything else. He also teaches his son how to behave friendly and talk socially with others. Singaperumal teaches his son not to trust anyone and focus only on academics, asks him to follow a timetable for everything and the goal is to achieve state topper in Class 10th and 12th exams, join a medical degree in a prestigious college and take up a master's medical degree in one of the United States's top medical colleges. Nadunilayan teaches his son not to stand out on any particular aspect and to take a centrist position in everything. His ideology is to live a low-profile life because he understands if one is very good or very bad in any of the aspects, he attracts the attention of society. When Vetriswaran is in second grade, Dhayalan is furious with the teaching approach of this school, gets into an argument with the school management, and moves his son out of the private school to a government school. Dhayalan's wife is angered by this event and separates from him; she goes to her parents‚Äô house and seeks divorce and custody of her son. However, her father rejects this idea and lets Dhayalan have custody of his son. The children grow into boys and become teenagers. Vetriswaran grows into a self-confident teenager excelling in both sports and studies; Chakravarthy as a studious but timid and indecisive boy whereas Mayilvaganam grows up with an inferiority complex about his height and studies. Dhayalan identifies that Vetriswaran is interested in swimming and enrols him in swimming classes, it leads to achieving a Guinness World Record at the age of 16. Dhayalan also identifies the ability of Mayilvaganam to write poems, compiles all his works and sends them to a leading lyricist Pa Vijay. Mayilvaganam's book gets a good recognition and he is felicitated by the renowned persons of the industry. Chakravarthy also joins at Dhayalan's backyard hut for children when his father is not at home, and the trio become friends with Nandhini (Yuva Lakshmi) and Rashitha Bhanu (Gabriella Charlton). They all study together and pass the 10th std examinations, with Bhanu and Chakravarthy becoming the state first students. Singaperumal's ideology is that dedication plus meditation plus concentration is equal to education and Chakravarthy tops 10th class with 99% and his father enrols him in one of the strictest higher secondary boarding schools in a distant locality. Chakravarthy is given a target by his father to top in Class 12th as well. He longs for the affection of his mother in the boarding school, succumbs to the rigorous rules, torture by staffs in a dark room and unforgiving pressure of school management. He calls Vetriswaran and the gang of children decides to meet him. They help him to sneak out and have fun but this is found out by the management and Chakravarthy faces repercussions. Singaperumal, while arguing with Dhayalan and the other children for meeting his son, suddenly receives a phone call that his son attempted suicide. Singaperumal who is in a shock reaches the hospital with Dhayalan and later apologises to Dhayalan for ill- treating and abusing him. He also exclaims that he did not even allow his son to talk friendly with him and hence Singaperumal realises his mistakes and then reforms. The whole management convinces that nothing serious has happened. But Kumaran (Sasikumar), a famous doctor, informs Dhayalan that that Chakravarthy already died 8 hours ago and was murdered by the School officials for complaining after a night long torture. The management publicise that Chakravarthy committed suicide because of a love failure but an angry student who is Chakravarthy's best friend tells the media the truth. Dhayalan reports the incident with evidence of a letter which the child has written for his father. Chakravarthy's friends are devastated. The story ends with the moral that children should be cherished and loved but not ignored and kept pressured.

Ranjith's Kabali (2016). He chose instead to use his time directing and producing a spin-off to his earlier film, Saattai (2012), and revealed that the film would be titled Appa. He revealed that the film would bear no resemblance to the first film, but would be a spiritual sequel and would revolve around the education system like the previous film. He initially approached Anbazhagan to direct the film, but the director's commitments to making Rupai produced by Prabhu Solomon, meant that Samuthirakani directed the film himself. Samuthirakani also revealed that the film's plot line had been taken from a real life incident, which happened when choosing a school for his son. The film was shot in 34 days, with Samuthirakani expressing his interest in remaking the film in 12 different Indian languages and revealed that he had begun talking to Telugu actors Nagarjuna and Venkatesh about reprising the lead roles. A teaser for the film was released during December 2015. Apparently, the Malayalam remake of this movie has begun on 25 March 2017 and it's going to be directed by Samuthirakani himself. This marks his debut in Malayalam film industry as director. Soundtrack This film‚Äôs music is composed by Ilaiyaraja with lyrics written by Madhan Karky. Release and reception The satellite rights of the film were sold to Polimer. Behindwoods stated, \\"Appa has moments of greatness but because of its opinionated presentation, at no level, it gives you a good degree of satisfaction nor makes you accept the flaws that have been pinpointed\\". Sify.com labelled the film as \\"below average\\" and added \\"to conclude, Samuthirakani‚Äôs Appa has lost track as the director carried away by the message and missed the target by a mile\\". Baradwaj Rangan of the Hindu wrote \\"Samuthirakani has grown into a terrific actor, and he works consistently with good filmmakers ‚Äî and you wonder if it isn‚Äôt time for him to look around between shots and pick up some tricks if he‚Äôs going to keep making movies. \\"https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/Appa-All- message-and-no-movie/article14465393.ece Sequel The sequel to the film was announced by director Samuthirakani through his official Twitter account on 18 June 2018 on the eve of the Father's Day. The shooting and production of the film commenced from late June 2018. He offered to shoot for the film while he was busy with his pending works including Aan Devathai and Naadodigal 2. The film is set to feature Samuthirakani and Thambi Ramaiah, with Namo Narayanan, Vignesh and Nasath in supporting roles; most of the cast members are retained in the sequel.

III for short, was a radar system used by the British Army to directly guide, or lay, anti-aircraft artillery (AA). The GL Mk. III was not a single radar, but a family of related designs that saw constant improvement during and after World War II. These were renamed shortly after their introduction in late 1942, becoming the Radar, AA, No. 3, and often paired with an early warning radar, the AA No. 4, which was also produced in several models. The Mk. III began development shortly after the introduction of the cavity magnetron in early 1940. The magnetron allowed radar systems to operate at microwave frequencies, which greatly reduced the size of their antennas and made them much more mobile and accurate. Having originally started work on the magnetron as part of the AI Mk. VIII air-to-air radar, the team was told to drop everything and develop a radar for AA use as quickly as possible. This turned into a fiasco; by the end of the year very little progress had been made and the team returned to working on airborne radars. The magnetron has also been demonstrated to the Canadians and US as part of the Tizard Mission in the fall of 1940. Immediately following the visit, the National Research Council of Canada began development of a GL radar based on the UK design. The first examples of these GL Mk. III(C) (for Canadian) arrived in the UK in November 1942. British units of slightly more advanced design, GL Mk. III(B) (for British) arrived in December. 667 of the Canadian models were produced, with about 250 of these seeing service in the UK while most of the others were sent to the continent or remained in Canada. 876 of the British models were produced and saw more widespread service. Fifty Mk. IIIs were supplied to the Soviet Union. Several improved versions of the Mk. III(B) were experimented with, but none were widely produced due to the 1944 introduction of the SCR-584 from the US, which provided both scanning and tracking in a single semi-trailer unit. Mk. III units found themselves relegated to secondary roles, as diverse as artillery spotting, coastal surveillance and weather balloon observation. Several upgrades were carried out for these roles, and modified weather units remained in use until about 1957/58. More radical development of the design also led to the greatly improved post-war AA No.3 Mk.7 radar, which served as the Army's primary AA radar until the removal of AA guns from service in the late 1950s. Development =Earlier systems= Transmitter cabin of the Mk. II radar, which indicates the size of the antennas needed at VHF frequencies. The Army began serious research in radar systems in 1937, after being introduced to the developments made by the Air Ministry at their experimental station at Bawdsey Manor. Among several possible uses for radar, the Army saw it as a way to address the pressing need to accurately measure the range to aerial targets. This was being handled by optical means that were difficult, time-consuming and error prone, and a radar system could dramatically improve this task. The development team, nicknamed the \\"Army Cell\\", was set the task of building a system that would provide slant range measurements with an accuracy of or better. The result was an unwieldy system known as the GL Mk. I radar. The Mk. I, like the Chain Home technology it was based on, used separate transmitter and receiver antennas that had to be moved in unison to track targets. The system did not provide an accurate bearing measurement, and had no provision for measuring elevation. It did, however, meet the requirement for 50 yard accuracy in range, a measure that was automatically fed into the analog computers that handled the ballistics calculations. Performance of the guns improved immediately; before the arrival of the Mk. It was estimated that 41,000 shells had to be fired to achieve one destroyed aircraft; the introduction of the Mk. I along with improved training reduced this to 18,500 by late 1940. Plans to add bearing and elevation measurements had been planned for a Mk. II version, which would be ready sometime in 1941. As it became clear that the need was more pressing, Leslie Bedford of A.C. Cossor suggested adding an elevation system to the Mk. I to get it into the field as soon as possible. This became the GL/EF system, which reached service in early 1941 and resulted in a huge decrease in rounds-per-kill to 4,100, making AA effective for the first time. Mk. II, which offered slightly higher accuracy, reduced this further to only 2,750 rounds-per-kill when it began to arrive in 1942. =Microwaves= The main reason for the unwieldiness of the early GL systems was a side-effect of the radio frequencies they used. GL had been designed in an era when the only electronics available were being adapted from commercial shortwave radio systems, and operated at wavelengths on the order of 5 to 50 m. It is a basic outcome of radio physics that antennas have to be roughly the size of the wavelength being used, which in this case required antennas several metres long. The Admiralty had been placed in charge of vacuum tube (valve) development for the war effort. They were particularly interested in moving to much shorter wavelengths as a way to detect smaller objects, especially the conning towers and periscopes of U-boats. The Air Ministry's Airborne Group, led by Edward George Bowen, had the opposite problem of desiring antennas small enough to mount in the nose of a twin- engine aircraft. They had managed to adapt an experimental television receiver to 1.5 m, but this still required large antennas that had to be mounted on the wings. At a meeting between Bowen and the Admiralty Experimental Department's Charles Wright, they found many reasons to agree on the need for a 10 cm wavelength system. Given the support for microwave development from both services, Henry Tizard visited the General Electric Company's (GEC) Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939 to discuss the issue. Watt followed up with a personal visit some time later, leading to a 29 December 1939 contract for a microwave AI radar set using conventional tube electronics. Meanwhile, the Admiralty's Communication Valve Development Committee (CVD) approached Birmingham University to develop entirely new tube designs that might lead to better results. =Magnetrons= The magnetron, about 10 cm across, revolutionized radar development. Birmingham's Mark Oliphant initially attacked the problem by attempting to further develop the klystron, a pre-war invention that was one of the first successful microwave- frequency tubes. In spite of many attempts, by the end of 1939 their best klystrons were generating only 400 watts, far below what would be needed for radar use. Two minor members of the team, John Randall and Harry Boot, had been asked to look at another concept which also failed to mature. Left with little to do, they begin considering alternative solutions. They struck upon the idea of using multiple resonant cavities arranged in a circle outside a common central core, as opposed to the klystron's linear arrangement. Their very first cavity magnetron produced 400 W, and was pushed to over 1 kW within a week. Within months, GEC had models producing pulses at 10 kW. These were soon being used in the design of a new airborne radar system initially known as AIS, for Airborne Interception, Sentimetric [sic]. The Army, meanwhile, had visited GEC on several occasions during 1940 and seen their progress using conventional tube electronics at shorter wavelengths. In a series of steps, GEC had managed to reduce the operating wavelengths of their systems from 1.5 m, the original airborne radar frequency, to 50 cm, and later to 25 cm. These could be used in a directional system with an antenna a metre or less in size. In contrast to the Airborne Group, who needed even shorter wavelengths to make very small antennas that could fit in the nose of an aircraft, or the Navy, who needed a system with enough resolution to pick up periscopes, the Army was looking only for a practical improvement in accuracy and smaller antennas. This could be met with GEC's solution. In August 1940, the Army issued a specification for a new GL radar that combined a VHF set like the Mk. II with a microwave-frequency tracking system with high accuracy. It required: * initial pick-up for early warning at 30,000 yards * pick-up for guidance at 22,000 yards * accurate range to any target between 2,000 and 17,000 yards, although a shorter maximum of 14,000 yards was acceptable * a beamwidth of 10 degrees ideally, but 14 degrees maximum * elevations from 10 to 90 degrees above the horizon, with tracking possible up to 70 degrees P. E. Pollard of the Air Defence Research and Development Establishment in Christchurch, Dorset had been one of the first people to consider radar as early as 1930, and had been working with the \\"Army Cell\\" at the Air Ministry Experimental Station for some time before joining other Army researchers at Christchurch, Dorset. They selected British Thomson-Houston (BTH), who built the earlier 5 m GL sets, to build a prototype. Pollard moved to BTH's plants in Rugby, Warwickshire to work on the new system. =Klystron failure= When Albert Percival Rowe, director of the Air Ministry's radar teams, heard of the Army efforts in September 1940, he set about creating his own GL development effort using the magnetron. After a 22 September meeting with Philip Joubert de la Fert√©, a senior commander in the RAF, Rowe built a GL team under the direction of D. M. Robinson using several members of the AIS team, telling them that they would have to focus on the GL problem for the next month or two. This led to increasing friction between Philip Dee, who ran the AI team's magnetron efforts, and Rowe, in overall command of the Air Ministry researchers. Dee claimed that Rowe was \\"seizing this opportunity to try and filch the GL problem from the ADEE\\" (the Army Cell) and that \\"only Hodgkin is carrying on undisturbed with AIS, and Lovell and Ward are fortunately engaged upon basic work with aerials and receivers and are therefore relatively undisturbed by this new flap.\\" According to Lovell this did not represent as much of a disruption as Dee believed. Moreover, to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had continued because of the Army's GL efforts. The main issue for adapting the AI concepts to the GL problem was that of angular precision. In the case of AI, the radar operator was able to track the target with an accuracy of about 3 degrees, improving to as much as 1 degree at close range. This was more than enough for the pilot to see the target close to dead-ahead once they approached to within about . For gun laying at long range the operators might never see the targets, so precision has to be at least degree, and would allow the guns to be directed solely by the radar. The solution to providing much higher angular accuracy was already known, a technique known as conical scanning. Shortly after Lovell began working on such a system, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, Inspector General for the RAF, visited the Rowe. After the visit, Rowe told the team that a complete GL set had to be ready for fitting to a gun in two weeks. By 6 November Robinson had assembled a prototype system, but by 25 November he sent a memo to Rowe and Lewis (Rowe's assistant) stating that in the last 19 days, the system had only worked for 2 days due to a wide variety of problems. In December he was told to take the work completed so far to BTH for development into a deployable system. On 30 December 1940, Dee commented in his diary that: =Magnetron GL= As part of the Tizard Mission in August 1940, an early magnetron had been demonstrated to representatives of both the US's National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as well as the Canadian National Research Council (NRC). The US and Canadian teams soon set up permanent contacts and split up their efforts to avoid duplication of work. A staff of six Canadians on loan from the NRC remained at the Radiation Lab through the war. On 23 October 1940, the NRC team received a telegram from England asking them to begin work on a GL system using a magnetron. The requirements asked for a tracking range of up to with a range accuracy of , although they desired it to be 25. They also wanted a search mode of unspecified range, with a range accuracy of . Angular accuracy had to be at least degrees in both axes, but was desired. All of the outputs had to directly drive magslips. Oddly, given the rudimentary state of radar development at the NRC at that time, the UK was largely absent from further development. Although information about the GL system's development continued to flow to Canada, little economic or scientific support was given until 1943 when the NRC greatly expanded its liaison office in London. This lack of coordination would severely delay Canadian production of many radar systems. In contrast, the Canadian-US liaison team had already agreed that the US should concentrate on a more sophisticated system while the Canadians worked on their basic design. Adding to the confusion, by January 1941 the Ministry of Supply gave up on the ongoing Army efforts in the UK and released a new specification for GL based on a magnetron. This meant that the earlier effort to develop a conventional transmitter had been wasted. On the upside, by this time magnetron supplies were improving, and using one would produce a radar working at even shorter wavelengths and much higher power, improving both range and accuracy. BTH eventually delivered an experimental low-power \\"A model\\" on 31 May 1941, although this was far from a field-ready system. =GL Mk. III(C) design= A Mk. III Accurate Position Finder (APF) ready for action, with its antennas raised and the carriage levelled. The cable behind the antennas runs to a winch on the front of the cabin that raises them into operating position. This GL Mk. IIIc APF is limbered for transit, with the antennas locked down. The cabin has been opened to display the electronics in the back of the consoles. Crewmen raise the antenna boom of the Zone Position Indicator (ZPI). The Canadian design became known as the Accurate Position Finder, or APF for short. At the time, the solution to rapidly switching a microwave signal between two antenna leads had not been solved. As a result, there was no way to use a single antenna for both transmission and reception, and the team initially considered systems with one transmitter and one receiver, or a single transmitter and four receivers. This profusion of antennas was not a major problem in the GL role; the reflectors were about a metre across, which was not too large for a ground-based system, especially considering the multi-metre wide antennas of the GL Mk. II it would replace. At the time no one knew \\"how to design a waveguide with a low-loss rotating point\\", so the problem of feeding the microwave energy from the magnetron to rotating antennas had no obvious solution. Instead, they decided to adopt the solution used for the earlier GL sets, and mount their entire electronics van on a bearing plate and point it in the required direction. This greatly complicated the trailer, and the fragility of the under-designed trailers was a major problem for Australian users. A key difference between the Mk. IIIc and the earlier Mk. II came about due to a lack of CRT's for displays. The Mk. II had three CRTs, one each for range, azimuth and altitude. The altitude and azimuth displays showed only a single selected target picked out by the range operator, and then showed the signals from the up and down antennas on one display and left and right on another. The operators compared the length of the blips in order to determine which was longer and turn the cabin in that direction. In the IIIc, the altitude and azimuth displays were replaced by mechanical pointers driven by the electrical difference in the two signals. Lacking a suitable early warning radar similar to the British Army's MRU's, the NRC also developed a second radar system known as the Zone Position Indicator (ZPI). This was rapidly developed using the basic design copied from the ASV Mk. II radar that had been supplied as part of an effort to begin production of ASV radars for the US Navy and Coast Guard. The ASV sets were based on conventional tube electronics, and operated in the 1.5 metre band that was common the early-war UK radars. As the APF operated at 10 cm, the two sets did not interfere with each other, and could be operated only meters apart. In operation, the ZPI would feed information to the APF, who would use this information to seek out the targets. The ZPI was the first radar of entirely Canadian design. In spite of the lack of close coordination with their British counterparts, the NRC had completed development of their version of the GL system in June 1941. The first full demonstration of the complete system was made to Canadian officials on 27 June, and again to visiting US officials on 23 July. At that time, the chief engineer of Westinghouse proved extremely impressed, and noted to a member of the NRC \\"that his company would not have believed that what we had done in nine months, could have been done in two years.\\" =GL Mk. III(C) production= While off to a great start in design terms, production of the units soon ran afoul of a peculiar Canadian wartime problem. Just after the opening of hostilities, General Andrew McNaughton, commander of the Canadian forces in Europe, urged that the government set up a company to supply the Canadian forces with various optical equipment like binoculars. These had been in short supply during World War I, and McNaughton was trying to ensure the same problem did not occur again. C.D. Howe, the Minister of Everything, set up a new Crown Corporation, Research Enterprises Limited (REL), to fill this need. When the need for electronics resulted in the need for a similar company, Howe chose to expand REL. REL had proven up to the task in the optics field, but when they expanded into electronics, trouble began. The first order for 40 GL sets had been placed in January 1941, before the NRC had completed development. This order was followed by several additional orders from Canada, the UK, Australia, South Africa and others. Delivery dates were repeatedly pushed back as REL had problems delivering on several pre-existing contracts for other radar systems. The first production example didn't roll off the line at REL until July 1942, by which time it was clear there was an issue and pressure was put on the electronics division to speed up deliveries. By this point, a single prototype had reached the UK in January 1942. This was sent to the Canadian Army and it was not seen by the British radar experts until some time later. When it did, the display system using the mechanical pointers proved to be an issue. In theory, this was simpler and less expensive, but it was also replacing a system that was already well known by Mk. II operators, demanding they be retrained. Another issue was that the Canadian designers had added a \\"velocity laying\\" system that smoothed out inputs to the control wheels that allowed for finer tracking, but was yet another change to get used to. In spite of these problems, there was still no delivery date on the UK versions, and likely due to pressure from Lindemann, an order was placed for an additional 560 examples, bringing the UK total to 600. The first shipment of GL sets reached the UK in November 1942. When they arrived, the units were found to be completely unreliable. This led to a round of finger pointing between the NRC team and REL. REL complained that the NRC had worked over 300 change orders into the design while production was being set up, filling a binder. The NRC, on the other hand, became convinced that the problem was due entirely to R.A. Hackbusch, director of the electronics section of REL. McNaughton became personally involved and had to call in Lt.Col. W. E. Phillips, director of REL, for a personal interview about the issues. He noted in his diary that Philips stated: In an attempt to get to the bottom of the situation, Mackenzie of the NRC arranged for Col. Wallace to visit the REL on 11 November 1942. Wallace began to talk to people on the shop floor, and was eventually told by one superintendent that Hackebusch personally ordered him to concentrate on quantity rather than quality, so that the systems were not being tested before delivery. It also became clear that Hackebusch had hidden this from Phillips in previous communications. In spite of this, and the continued failures in the field, no action was immediately taken to fix the problem. During a visit to Ottawa in March 1943, Phillips met with Mackenzie and Wallace and agreed the problem was real, admitting \\"all the weaknesses of Hackbusch and [said] they are going to make a fundamental change which we all know is overdue by at least two years.\\" Yet still nothing was done. It was not until 2 September that Philips was \\"forced to accept his [Hackbusch's] resignation\\". A week later, Wallace was given the job, although he remained Director of the Radio Branch at NRC as well. When Mackenzie visited REL on 30 March 1944, he reported that the company was completely reorganized. Adding to their problems, REL was constantly short of magnetrons, which were built by General Electric in the US, CRTs for the displays, or the multitude of other conventional vacuum tubes the system used. Then, in the middle of development, the UK demanded that the system be upgraded to support IFF use. Lacking an IFF unit of their own, British sets were used, which proved to interfere with the ZPIs, which operated in similar frequencies. In spite of all these problems, REL delivered 314 sets by the end of 1942, and these quickly replaced the older Mk. II sets at AA emplacements around the UK. The UK-based APFs formed the backbone of the London-area AA direction during Operation Steinbock in early 1944, the last concerted German bombing effort using manned aircraft. One of the earliest uses for the III(C) in Canada was as a surface-search system to detect U-boats in the Saint Lawrence River. By 1943 the need for the Mk. III units had dried up with the imminent arrival of the SCR-584 units from the United States. The UK cancelled its order in January 1944, which was a major blow to REL. Of the 667 Mk. III(C)s eventually completed, 600 were sent to the UK, with about half of these were used in the field in Europe as mobile units, and the other half used at static emplacements in the UK. The small number of Mk. III(C)s sent to Australia proved almost unusable as delivered, and had to be extensively re-built in order to make them operational. =GL Mk. III(B) production= Bill Wallace operates the range and bearing controls of a GL Mk. III radar while tracking a weather balloon for the Met Office during the 1950s. After the first experimental magnetron set had been delivered in April 1941, BTH continued development of their Mk. III design, introducing a Model B in July 1941. This led to an order for 28 hand-built prototypes, five of which were delivered between December and April 1942, reaching only eight by the end of the year. Along with the prototype order, an order for a further 900 production models had also been placed in July 1941. This last order was later increased to 1,500, 500 each from BTH, Standard Telephones and Cables and Ferranti. The first of these models arrived in December 1942. Since BTH's Mk. III(B) had its design frozen sometime later than the Canadian model, it featured a number of improvements that produced a much more practical design. Foremost among these differences was the mounting of the antennas on a large metal pole, the rotor, that projected down through the roof to the floor of the trailer where it sat in a bearing. Instead of trying to rotate the microwave feeds, the III(B) mounted the radio frequency components on the mast, and then fed power to them via conventional brushings. This allowed the antennas, on top of the mast, to rotate easily under the control of the operator turning a large handwheel. This eliminated the need to rotate the entire cabin and greatly simplified the carriage. A number of other details changed as well, notably the elimination of the electronics needed to compare the left/right and up/down signals, and the lack of the \\"velocity laying\\" system. This reduced the valve count from 120 to 60, a significant issue in that era, which made the resulting design smaller, more mobile and about half the cost. A minor change was the use of fabric covers stretched over the antenna and fastened to the outside edge of the parabolic reflectors. With the covers in place, the assemblies look like two flat disks, an easy way to tell them apart from the Canadian version. It was at this point that Fredrick Lindmann stepped in. He was not impressed by anti-aircraft fire, and stated that more German bombers would be destroyed by bombing the homes of the people that manufactured them than any amount that radar-guided guns could hope for. He suggested cancelling the production order to allow the British firms to concentrate on the H2S radar that would allow British bombers free range over Germany, and relegating the AA radars to the Canadian model that seemed to be available more quickly anyway. At this point, a shortage of electronic valves (\\"tubes\\") broke out as all of the services in the UK demanded new radar systems. Frederick Alfred Pile, the General in charge of AA, had no illusions as to where the Army fitted into the schedule of priorities. Delays dragged on, and it was not until late in 1943 that there were enough supplies to enter full-scale production. At this point, a second order for 2,000 units was placed. However, total production during 1944 was only 548 sets. By this time the US SCR-584 was beginning to arrive and was considerably better than the Mk. III(B), so production was deliberately slowed. When production ended in April 1945, a total of 876 had been delivered. Some of these also included interrogators for IFF Mark III, which can be distinguished by the two large whip antennas extending from the rear cabin roof. In the field, it was noticed that the III(B) could pick up mortar rounds at a range of about . By taking the position of the round at several points during the flight, it was possible to calculate where it was launched from. =GL Mk. III(B) versions= Mk. III(B) was upgraded several times during the production run, although these later versions are universally known by the later AA No. 3 Mk. 2 name, the Mk. 1 being the III(C). The Mk. 2/1 version added automatic tracking that allowed the operator to lock onto to a target and then have the electronics automatically follow it with no further manual intervention. The /2 was a dual-mode system who's displays could be used for anti-aircraft or in the Coast Defense role. The /3 also had lock- follow, but used a model developed by AA Command rather than Army's Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE). The /5 was a /2 with the same lock-follow as the /3. The AA No. 3 Mk. 2(F) was an unmodified No. 3 used by the Field Army as a mortar locating radar. It was the AA No. 3 Mk. 2/4 that achieved the only lasting use of the original Mk. III design. This was a AA No. 3 Mk. 2 with additional circuitry that allowed the timebase to be offset by the equivalent of or . This provided three sets of ranges, 0 to 32,000, 30,000 to 62,000, and 60,000 to 92,000 yards. This version was used as a meteorological system for measuring the winds aloft by launching weather balloons with radar reflectors that allowed them to be tracked for extended periods. The Mk.2/4 was widely used into the late 1950s in this role. =Other GL radars= While development of the Mk. III dragged on, the Army began a crash program to develop an intermediate system using the same 1.5 m band electronics being widely used in other radars. Known as \\"Baby Maggie\\", it is unclear whether it was assigned a number in the original GL series, although it was named using the new nomenclature as the AA No. 3 Mk. 3. The Royal Artillery's historian records that 'Baby Maggie' originated in the Mediterranean theatre with 62nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which commanded the AA units in the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). It was intended as a light-weight alternative to the bulky two-cabin GL sets, capable of being landed over open beaches. Improvised from existing Searchlight Control Radar (SLC) components and reduced to bare essentials, its transmitter, receiver, aerial array and operating display were all housed in a single two-wheeled trailer towed by a 3-ton lorry. It had a maximum detection range of depending on siting, and for gunnery purposes could track from inwards. Twelve sets were issued to heavy AA Troops deployed in the first phase of the Husky landings, and it was employed again for the landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche). Baby Maggie's performance in action was disappointing, not because of any radar defects but because of mechanical failure caused by rough going. The trailer chassis was overloaded, and on steep gradients the top of the cabin fouled the towing vehicle, with consequent damage. It was abandoned after Salerno. A number of sources claim that 50 Baby Maggies were sent to the USSR. Whether these are the same as the reports of the 50 GL Mk. III's being sent, or if 50 of the Baby Maggie and another 50 Mk. III(B) were sent, remains unclear. Some units saw post-war use in India for weather balloon tracking. Development of the Mk. III continued through the period while the SCR-584 was being deployed. This led to a new model in 1944, the AA No.3 Mk. 4, code named \\"Glaxo\\". Only a few Glaxos were produced during the last stages of the war. Further development of the same design under the rainbow codename \\"Blue Cedar\\" produced an extremely successful design that entered service as the AA No. 3 Mk. 7. Mk. 7 remained in use as the UK's primary gun laying radar until the large AA guns were removed from service in the late 1950s. The Mk. 7 was also used as the illuminator for an early beam riding surface-to-air missile, Brakemine. Description This description is based on the British Mk. III(B) model. In general terms the Mk. III(C) would be similar, with the exception of details of the mechanical arrangement of the trailer and cabin. =Equipment layout= The Mk. III was built on a five-ton, four-wheel trailer made by Taskers of Andover. The cabin was built by Metro Cammell, a builder of railway carriages. The deck of the front of the trailer was waist height, providing room for the front axle to steer during towing. Immediately behind the wheels the chassis stepped down, with the rear portion being closer to the ground. The main cabin was situated on top of this lower section, with fenders providing clearance around the rear wheels. The radar antennas were mounted on a large metal pole extending from the top of the cabin. A complex framework just above the roof allowed the antennas to be rotated vertically, controlled by an arm mounted behind the right parabolic reflector (dish). The two dishes were mounted on either side of the pole, with a gap between them. IFF antennas, if mounted, extended from the two upper rear corners of the cabin. The higher front area of the trailer mounted a generator as well as wooden boxes for storage of spares and tools. To set up for operation, the trailer was parked on suitably flat land and the brakes were locked. Three levelling jacks were then swung out from the trailer, one on either side at the front where the step in the chassis met the cabin, and another from the rear of the cabin. The jacks were then used to level the cabin using spirit levels. The radar dishes were then raised, the generator started, and operations could begin. The entire setup took about 20 minutes, with 3 minutes required to warm up the electronics. The entire system, including trailer, weighed over , was high with the antennas raised or with them lowered for transport, was just over long and wide, extending to wide with the levelling jacks deployed. =Signal details= The system was driven by a 440 Hz motor driven alternator mounted on the front of the cabin. This powered the electronics, as well as a motor in the receiver dish that spun the antenna at 440 rpm. The same motor also drove a small two-phase alternator whose relative phases rotated in synchronicity with the receiver antenna. The transmitter consisted of a single magnetron, initially 100 kW but up to 350 kW in later versions. It produced a 1 microsecond pulse at the same 440 Hz rate as the main alternator. This produced a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 440 Hz, very low for a radar of this type. For comparison, the German W√ºrzburg radar, the Mk. III's counterpart, had a PRF of 3,750, which provides a much better signal on reception. The receiver consisted of two superheterodyne units. The first used a tunable klystron and crystal detector to produce an intermediate frequency (IF) of 65 MHz which then went through a two-stage amplifier. The result was then mixed down to a new IF of 10 MHz and into a three-stage amplifier. A final rectifier produced a signal that was fed directly into the Y-axis deflection plates of the CRTs. Which CRT to feed the signal two was controlled by the phase of the smaller alternator. The output was sent into a switchbox that compared the relative phase of the two signals, sending it out one of four outputs, rotating from up to right, bottom and left. The right and up channels were passed through delays. =Displays and interpretation= Close- up of the console seen above. The upper CRT, eye level, is the coarse range display. The metal wire used for positioning the blip is just visible on the fine range display below it. The range is read off the clock-like gauge to the right of the lower CRT. Bearing and elevation displays are to the left, out of frame. The stopwatch at the top was added so the Met Office operators could time their measurements accurately. The Mk. III elevation and bearing displays would look similar to these images of the AI Mk. IV radar. A single target blip can just be seen about half-way along the time base. The blips are equal length on the left display, but slightly longer on the right side of the right display. This means the target is centred vertically, but slightly to the right. The large triangular shapes on the left and top are caused by ground reflections, and would not normally be seen when the antennas were pointed upward. The Mk. III used a somewhat complex multi-cathode ray tube (CRT) display system known as the Presentation Unit, built by The Gramophone Company (EMI). Typical radar displays of the era measured range by comparing the blip of the return against its position on the CRT face. Measuring against a scale might offer range accuracy on the order of on the Mk. III's CRTs, far less accuracy than needed for the gun laying role. To solve this problem, the Mk. III used two range displays, coarse and fine. The coarse display, placed about eye level in the console, was a classic A-scope display, showing all the blips within the range of the radar, normally . A large handwheel projecting from the console about knee level rotated a large potentiometer who's output was sent into a large capacitor. When the capacitor reached a pre-selected voltage, it triggered a second timebase generator set to 6 microseconds, or in the case of the radar's there-and-back round trip, . The output of this time base was inverted and mixed into the signal on the coarse display, causing an bright extended line to appear along the bottom of the baseline, known as the strobe. As the operator turned the handwheel, the strobe moved back and forth along the display, allowing the selection a particular target by centring it within the strobe. Moving the strobe allowed the range operator to select targets within the 1,000 yard \\"window\\". This window filled the fine range display; this was also a 6 inch display so on this display every inch represented about , offering much greater accuracy. In operation, the operator would continually turn the handwheel in an effort to keep the blip exactly centred in the display, as measured against a fine metal wire stretched over the face of the tube. This allowed continual range output with an accuracy on the order of , more than accurate enough for the gun laying role. To the right of the fine display was a mechanical dial with a large pointer that displayed the current range as selected by the handwheel. An even faster timebase, 4 microseconds long, was triggered at the center of the strobe. Only those signals in this window were sent to the elevation and bearing displays, so their displays showed only the single blip selected in the strobe. This eliminated the need for them to have a course display. Instead, their stations had only the equivalent of the fine display, repositioned at eye level to make reading easier. The vacant display location in the lower panel where the fine display would normally be was instead used to hold the mechanical dials that displayed the current bearing or altitude. The bearing operator sat to the left of the range operator, and the altitude operator to his left. This allowed a single operator at the range display to reach the bearing handwheel with ease, although the altitude wheel was somewhat of a reach. Although this method of scanning allowed accurate measurement of the angle of the target, it did not directly indicate which direction to turn the antenna to center it ‚Äì this could be seen in the rising and falling blip strength, but in practice, this was far too fast to follow visually. This is where the electrical delays on the switchbox came into play. By delaying the right signal compared to the left, the resulting display shows two peaks separated horizontally. These would be roughly centered depending on the accuracy of the range operator. The higher blip was in the direction to turn; if the left blip was larger, the operator needed to turn the antenna to the left. the up/down display worked the same, although the operator had to \\"rotate\\" the image in their head. =Operational technique= Given the limited angle that the Mk. III scanned, 10 degrees at most, the system was normally paired with a second radar with a much wider scanning pattern. In the case of the AA No. 4, this provided a complete 360 degree scan that was displayed on a plan-position indicator. The operators of this second radar would call out contacts to the Mk. III operators, who would spin their antenna to the indicated bearing and then move the antenna vertically to find the target. When a blip was seen on the coarse range display, the range operator would move the strobe into position, and from then on all of the operators would move their controls continuously to create smooth tracking. The range control was connected to a potentiometer and measured range electronically. The elevation and azimuth was measured via the physical position of the antenna. Turning the handwheels at these positions drove the rotor assembly through selsyn motors, and the current position was fed back to the operator display using magslips, better known today as synchros. The output of the magslips was also amplified and sent to external connectors, where they could be used to create additional displays at remote locations. These were normally sent into the inputs of the gunnery analog computers, known as predictors. =IFF use= As early as 1940 some British aircraft were equipped with the IFF Mk. II system, and by the time the Mk. III radars were being introduced in 1943, many aircraft were equipped with IFF Mk. III. These consisted of a transponder installed on the aircraft that was tuned to a pre-selected frequency, and when it heard a signal on this frequency, sent out a short signal of its own on a different pre-selected frequency. GL Mk. III was optionally equipped with the corresponding interrogator. When the radar operator pressed a button, the interrogator would send out periodic signals on the selected frequency via a large whip antenna mounted at the rear corner of the cabin. The responding signal from the transponder was received on a second antenna on the opposite rear corner of the cabin, amplified, and sent into the displays. This signal mixed with the radar's own receiver, causing the new signal to be displayed directly behind the blip. Instead of a sharp bell curve like shape, a signal responding to the IFF challenge would have a rectangular extension behind it, allowing the operator to easily see which aircraft were friendly. In practice, IFF selection was often handled by the search radar before they handed off to the GL, and the IFF fittings on GL were not universal. =Meteorological use= The Mk. III's longest lasting use was for meteorological measurements of winds aloft by tracking radar reflectors hung from weather balloons. To measure speed, a stopwatch was mounted near the range display and readings were made every minute. As the balloons often blew out of the radar's nominal 32,000 yard range, these versions were equipped with a Range Extender device. This was a monostable multivibrator, known as a One-Shot or Kipp Relay, that triggered the coarse time base, offsetting its starting point so it did not trigger immediately after the transmission, but a selected time after that. The Extender had settings for 30,000 or 60,000 yards, so the system could track the balloons in three general windows, 0 to 32,000 yards, 30,000 to 62,000, and 60,000 to 92,000. These units were produced after the naming had been changed, and were universally known as AA No. 3 Mk. 2/4.

It was originally designed to be a farmhouse but went through different adaptive reuse. The building served as a farmhouse for two hundred years and is found in the suburb of Kappara. During the French occupation of Malta, the building served as the headquarters for the rise of the Maltese against the French, known as the Gharghar rise and led by the building's owner Vincenzo Borg. A plaque was attached on the fa√ßade, during the British period, commemorating Borg's role in the revolt. The building came to national attention when it was mentioned in the Maltese Parliament by Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi, then followed by its scheduling by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority. Today the building is a national cultural monument. The building is a private property and following its refurbishment it is used as a residential home. Description and Location The Ta' Xindi Farmhouse was built by unknown Maltese farmers sometimes during the period that the Order of St. John controlled Malta. It is structurally modest in design and built to cater as any farm of the time, according to local costumes. It is built in the suburb of an area called Kappara in San ƒ†wann. The building remains overlooks farmland and is at the middle of a hill. A common building which the building overlooks today is the Mater Dei Hospital in Birkirkara. When the building was built the area was under the municipality of Birkirkara but today is under the jurisdiction of the San ƒ†wann Local Council. History At the end of the Order of St. John the building belonged to Vincenzo Borg who was famously known by his nickname, Brared. In 1798 Malta was invaded by the French led by Napoleon Bonaparte who were on their way to conquer Egypt. Over 4,000 men were left behind the Napoleon when he left in order to keep control of the Maltese archipelago. The balcony and niche at Ta' Xindi Farmhouse Initially the Maltese had supported the French but having not received what they expected, growing in disappointment and propagated by landlords and the Catholic Church, the Maltese rose up against the French in different battalions around Malta. In such context the Ta' Xindi Farmhouse became also known since then as the San ƒ†wann Headquarters when Vincenzo Borg took the lead for the rising against the French, famously known as the Gharghar rise. Vincenzo Labini, the then bishop of Malta, was well informed about the insurgence of the Maltese. Alexander Ball initially did not trust Vincenzo Borg in the belief that Borg was after power over the Maltese.Desmond Gregory (1996), \\"Malta, Britain, and the European Powers, 1793-1815\\", Associated University Presses, Political Science, p. 167-8.Malcolm Archibald (2014), Treasure\\", Black and White Publishing. p. 53. .By Barry Hough, Howard Davis, Lydia Davis (2010), \\"Coleridge's Laws: A Study of Coleridge in Malta\\", Open Books Publishers, , p. 122. During the conflict the farmhouse, now an outpost, was secretly used as headquarters while the French soldiers kept control of the fortifications of Malta. The building manned more than 550 native Maltese soldiers of mixed capacities. The soldiers safeguarded and over the surrounding areas and generally attacked at once with other outposts such as Birkirkara and Mosta. On 2 September the Maltese resurgence has managed to acquire two 18-pound cannons that were stored and at times used at the farmhouse. The flag of Great Britain was raised for the very first time in Malta in 1799 by Vincenzo Borg himself of which a plaque was inaugurated on the fa√ßade of the farmhouse that includes this historic event. During the insurgency the farmhouse was also used as an emergency hospital.Cassar, Paul, \\"Hookham Frere in Malta, pp. 61-62, Melitensiawth.com Despite being small, the building had to cater as a hospital for a large number of families which included people who took refuge in the countryside from the fortified cities that were occupied by the French.Savona-Ventura, Charles (2015), \\"Knight Hospitaller Medicine in Malta (1530-1798)\\", Lulu.com, , 9781326482220, p. 301, 302.Reynell, Henry (1811), \\"The appeals of the nobility and people of Malta, to the justice, public faith, and policy, of the British government, for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which they gave up their island to the king, namely, their ancient rights, under a free constitution.

Back then Prime Minister in Office Lawrence Gonzi has made reference to the farmhouse and its rich history. Since then measures of preservation have taken place. The building remains to be a private residence and not a museum. It is currently being used by its owners as a family home.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours and was appointed as the first Professor of the Practice of Entrepreneurship by King's College London in December 2016. Allesch-Taylor was named as one of London's most influential people in both 2017 and 2018's 'Social Pillars: Charity and Philanthropy' section of the London Evening Standard's Progress 1000 list. Early life and education Stefan Allesch-Taylor was born in St Albans in Hertfordshire in 1969 He attended Giggleswick School (1980‚Äì1987) in North Yorkshire and left school at 18. He stated in an interview with Times Higher Education that his biggest regret is 'not going to university'. Business Allesch-Taylor has been described by the London Evening Standard as 'one of the Square Mile's foremost financiers'. As a chairman, CEO and Senior Director in business, Allesch-Taylor specialises in public companies. He first served as Chief executive of a UK public company at 27 years old by which time he was already a millionaire. He has co-founded or invested in more than 50 companies across 15 countries over the past 25 years. He has co-founded and/or served on the boards of companies in the hospitality, industrial, agriculture, retail, technology, sports, banking and financial services sectors. Allesch-Taylor is authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority as a corporate advisor, as well as being approved as a 'Controller' of an Asset Manager in Denmark and approved by the German Bundesbank as a 'Controller' of NordFinanz Bank AG, a German commercial bank. He chairs the Audit Committees of several companies of which he is a board member. In 2010, he launched The Department of Coffee and Social Affairs. Philanthropy Allesch-Taylor considers philanthropy key to good business: \\"Companies need to take a look at being more socially impactful and engaging more with their consumer base\\". He is co- founder and chairman of the Afri-CAN Children's Charity, operating in Malawi and South Africa, which he established in 2010 with a $1 million donation. The Afri-CAN Children's Charity provides education and nutrition to over 3,000 vulnerable children in the townships of Cape Town. Allesch-Taylor is chairman of the award-winning British-based charity Pump Aid. Pump Aid won the International Aid and Development Award at the 2017 UK Charity Awards for its innovative small business approach to relieving water poverty in Malawi.

Each deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is an UFA, but not vice versa. DFA, UFA, and NFA recognize exactly the same class of formal languages. On the one hand, an NFA can be exponentially smaller than an equivalent DFA. On the other hand, some problems are easily solved on DFAs and not on UFAs. For example, given an automaton A, an automaton A which accepts the complement of A can be computed in linear time when A is a DFA, it is not known whether it can be done in polynomial time for UFA. Hence UFAs are a mix of the worlds of DFA and of NFA; in some cases, they lead to smaller automata than DFA and quicker algorithms than NFA.  Formal definition  An NFA is represented formally by a 5-tuple, A=(Q, Œ£, Œî, q0, F). An UFA is an NFA such that, for each word w = a1a2 ‚Ä¶ an, there exists at most one sequence of states r0,r1, ‚Ä¶, rn, in Q with the following conditions: # r0 = q0 # ri+1 ‚àà Œî(ri, ai+1), for i = 0, ‚Ä¶, n‚àí1 # rn ‚àà F. In words, those conditions state that, if w is accepted by A, there is exactly one accepting path, that is, one path from an initial state to a final state, labelled by w.  Example  Let L be the set of words over the alphabet {a,b} whose nth last letter is an a. The figures show a DFA and a UFA accepting this language for n=2. Deterministic automaton (DFA) for the language L for n=2 Unambiguous finite automaton (UFA) for the language L for n=2 The minimal DFA accepting L has 2n states, one for each subset of {1...n}. There is an UFA of n+1 states which accepts L: it guesses the nth last letter, and then verifies that only n-1 letters remain. It is indeed unambiguous as there exists only one nth last letter.  Inclusion and related problems  Three PSPACE-hard problems for general NFA belong to PTIME for DFA and are now considered. = Inclusion = It is decidable in polynomial-time whether an UFA's language is a subset of another UFA's language. Let A and B be two UFAs. Let L(A) and L(B) be the languages accepted by those automata. Then L(A)‚äÜL(B) if and only if L(A‚à©B)=L(A), where A‚à©B denotes the Cartesian product automaton, which can be proven to be also unambiguous. Now, L(A‚à©B) is a subset of L(A) by construction; hence both sets are equal if and only if for each length n‚àà‚Ñï, the number of words of length n in L(A‚à©B) is equal to the number of words of length n in L(A). It can be proved that is sufficient to check each n up to the product of the number of states of A and B. The number of words of length n accepted by an automaton can be computed in polynomial time using dynamic programming, which ends the proof.Christof L√∂ding, Unambiguous Finite Automata, Slide 8 = Related problems = The problem of universalityi.e.: given a UFA, does it accept every string of Œ£*? and of equivalence,i.e.: given two UFAs, do they accept the same set of strings? also belong to PTIME, by reduction to the inclusion problem.  Checking whether an automaton in unambiguous  For a nondeterministic finite automaton A with n states and an m letter alphabet, it is decidable in time O(n2m) whether A is unambiguous. It suffices to use a fixpoint algorithm to compute the set of pairs of states q and q' such that there exists a word w which leads both to q and to q' . The automaton is unambiguous if and only if there is no such a pair such that both states are accepting. There are at most O(n2) state pairs, and for each pair there are m letters to consider to resume the fixpoint algorithm, hence the computation time.  Some properties  The cartesian product of two UFAs is a UFA.Christof L√∂ding, Unambiguous Finite Automata, Slide 8 * The notion of unambiguity extends to finite state transducers and weighted automata. If a finite state transducer T is unambiguous, then each input word is associated by T to at most one output word. If a weighted automaton A is unambiguous, then the set of weight does not need to be a semiring, instead it suffices to consider a monoid. Indeed, there is at most one accepting path. State complexity Mathematical proofs that every UFA for a language needs a certain number of states were pioneered by Schmidt. Leung proved that a DFA equivalent to an n-state UFA requires 2^n states in the worst case. and a UFA equivalent to an n-state NFA requires 2^n-1 states. Jir√°sek, Jir√°skov√° and ≈†ebej researched the number of states necessary to represent basic operations on languages. They proved in particular that for every n-state UFA the complement of the language it accepts is accepted by a UFA with O(2^{0.79n}) states. For a one-letter alphabet Okhotin proved that a DFA equivalent to an n-state UFA requires e^{\\\\Theta(\\\\sqrt[3]{n (\\\\ln n)^2})} states in the worst case.

The portion which is in use runs from Jamesburg, NJ, to the current end of service at Freehold, NJ. Technically, the line continues to a junction with the Southern Secondary in Farmingdale, NJ, but this portion has been out of service since the early 2000s. Jamesburg ROW History =Construction and early history (1851‚Äì1879)= The Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad was incorporated in 1851 to connect Freehold with the Camden and Amboy Railroad in Jamesburg. The first section between the aforementioned towns was opened to traffic in 1853. In 1868, the line was extended to a connection with the Northeast Corridor (then Camden and Amboy Railroad's main line). On the other end of the line, a firm known as the Squankum and Freehold Marl Company built track from Freehold to Farmingdale in 1868, and leased it to the Freehold and Jamesburg in the same year. The final link in the railroad, between Farmingdale and Sea Girt was built by the Farmingdale and Squan Village Railroad Company which was incorporated on April 3, 1867, and mandated to finish construction of their line by July 1, 1877. Its line was leased to the Freehold and Jamesburg in 1874. Also in 1874, the line between Jamesburg and Monmouth Junction (the connection with the Northeast Corridor) was sold to the Camden and Amboy Railroad. On May 24, 1879, the three companies were merged to form a new company also called the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad Country. In the Board of Directors Election held on June 24, 1879, Strickland Kneass was elected president (he had been named president on the merger documents in May, but had not been formally elected by the board until June). Since June 1, 1879, the company's trackage has been operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. =Pennsylvania Railroad/Penn Central operation (1879‚Äì1976)= Operation continued and prospered under the Pennsylvania Railroad, and both freight and passenger trains used the line up until the Pennsylvania Cut its Trenton-Jamesburg-Sea Girt train on May 29, 1962. The line famously hosted dying President Garfield, and his private train as it traveled from Washington, DC, to where he died in Elberon, NJ. In 1939, the line hosted the King and Queen of England's private train, en route to Red Bank, NJ.A Railroad History of the Royal Visit, 1939 After dieselization, the line's passenger trains were a favorite with railfans because of their use of Doodlebugs, a gas electric car.http://njrails.tripod.com/19th_Century/Freehold_Jamesburg/Freehold_Jamesburg.htm Freight service continued after the end of passenger service, but in 1964, the section between Sea Girt and Farmingdale was torn up, parts of which became the Edgar Felix Bikeway. =Conrail (1976‚Äìpresent)= In 1976, Conrail took over the operations of seven northeastern railroads, including the Penn Central, who operated the line after the 1968 merger of the Pennsylvania and the New York Central Railroad (the New Haven Railroad was incorporated into the merger in 1969, but its inclusion was of little consequence to this particular line). Unlike other routes that it operated, Conrail did not abandon the remaining portions of the Freehold Secondary, but a 1978 division map marks the section between Freehold and Jamesburg as a \\"light density line.\\" In the 1999 breakup of Conrail between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation, the line went to Conrail Shared Assets (CSAO), a joint switching and terminal railroad created in order to serve the New York, Philadelphia and Detroit markets equally from both carriers. CSAO initially kept the entire line open, but since the early 2000s, there has not been a train east of the Prestone plant in Freehold.

Times)-April 8, 2009), better known to the general public as \\"Pop\\" Winans, was an American gospel music singer and band manager. Winans was best known as the manager of the gospel group The Winans during its early years in the 1980s and as the patriarch of the Winans family. Pop Winans also had a solo career in music, releasing a CD of gospel music with his wife Delores \\"Mom\\" Winans called Mom & Pop Winans in 1989. The CD was nominated for a Grammy Award. Winans himself received a gospel nomination for best traditional gospel album for his solo album Uncensored in 2000. Early life =Childhood= Winans was born David Glenn on April 20, 1934 in Detroit, Michigan. His parents never married and he was raised by his mother, Laura Glenn, a singer with the Zion Congregational Church of God in Christ. However, Winans was brought up in Detroit's Mack Avenue Church of God in Christ, of which his paternal grandfather, Isaiah Winans, was the pastor. His father, Carvin Winans (April 16, 1902 - February 1, 1992), denied paternity of David. When he grew up, David changed his surname from Glenn to Winans at the request of his grandfather. =Early singing career and The Nobelaires= At the age of 18, Winans began singing with The Nobelaires, a soul group in Detroit. Winans played the saxophone and the clarinet and joined the Lucille Lemon Gospel Chorus in 1950. However, after his children were born, Winans put aside his singing career and would not sing professionally again for the next 30 years. =Delores Ransom= Delores Ransom was born on September 22, 1936 in Detroit. Her father was a baker and her mother was a homemaker. She has one sister. As a youth, Delores learned how to play the piano and as an adolescent began piano playing for the Lucille Lemon Gospel Chorus. Ransom was the chorus' pianist for ten years. In 1950, Ransom and Winans met for the first time. The two soon began to date and were married at Zion Congregational COGIC on November 21, 1953. The couple's eldest child, David Winans Jr., now an engineer, was born on September 24, 1954. Six more sons; Ronald, Carvin II, Marvin (fraternal twins), Michael, Daniel and Benjamin \\"BeBe\\", were born before the Winans' first daughter Priscilla Marie (CeCe Winans) was born on October 8, 1964. Two more daughters; Angelique \\"Angie\\" (born 1968) and Debbie (born 1972), were born to David and Delores completing the set of ten children born to the couple. Over the next few years, Winans worked various dead end jobs to financially support his family. Those jobs included work as a car salesman, taxi driver, barber and janitor. Winans even had a job working for the main assembly plant of the Dodge Automobile Company in Detroit during the 1960s. =Preaching career= Pop Winans began to preach in Detroit churches in 1969. Reportedly, Winans first got the call to preach in 1964, but ignored it and waited a few years. Winans preached his first sermon at the Detroit Pentecostal Church of Hope where family friend Bishop Ramey was the preacher. Ramey was saved by Winans great-uncle Fred Winans in Mississippi. His first sermon was from the book of Isaiah chapter 55. Career =The Winans= Sons Ronald, Carvin II, Marvin, and Michael began singing at young ages in church. In the early 1980s, the boys were discovered by gospel legend Andra√© Crouch. Soon after, the boys, performing under the name \\"The Winans\\", were signed to Light Records. Pop Winans soon became involved with the group becoming the boys' personal manager. Their first record, Introducing The Winans was produced in 1981. They performed vocals in This is America, Charlie Brown's segment \\"The Building of the Transcontinental Railroad\\" in 1989. Their style was noted for its crossover efforts and received airplay on R&B; radio. The group's last recording was in 1995, but they have subsequently been involved in various Winans family projects where they are credited as \\"The Winans\\" (e.g. November 2000's Christmas: Our Gifts To You which Winans sang on). Son Benjamin and daughter Priscilla began singing together around the same time The Winans released their first album. The two became known as BeBe & CeCe and also began singing and releasing hit albums. Some of their hit singles include Addictive Love and I'll Take You There. =Solo career= Winans and his wife Delores, who became known to the general public as \\"Mom\\" Winans, began singing professionally in the late 1980s. Their debut album, Mom & Pop Winans, was released by Sparrow Records in 1989. The album earned a Grammy nomination in the Best Traditional Soul Gospel album category. Their second album, The Rest of My Life, appeared in 1991. The latter set includes a rendition of the classic hymn \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\". Pop wrote his first two songs on it, \\"You've Got To Surrender\\" and \\"Who Shall Abide\\". Winans only solo album, Uncensored (Against The Flow), was released in 1999. The album features a combination of classics such as \\"This Train\\" and new compositions such as \\"Is There Any Hope?\\" and Holdin' On (Let Go and Let God)\\". Uncensored received a Grammy nomination for best traditional gospel album in 2000. Personal life =Philanthropy= In 1968, Winans founded a youth organization in Detroit. The goal of the organization was to help the children of Detroit with whatever problems they were facing whether domestic, financial, educational or etc. The organization served around 300 kids and involved ten little league baseball teams, a track team, arts and crafts. In their later years, Mom and Pop Winans made appearances on many Christian programs and were frequent contributors to the Trinity Broadcasting Network and the Christian Broadcasting Network. Mom and Pop also frequently appeared at Benny Hinn crusades during the 1990s and 2000s and were regular guest on TBN's Praise the Lord television program. =Family= David married Delores at Zion Congregational Church of God in Christ in Detroit on November 21, 1953. The couple had ten children; * David Winans Jr. (b. September 24, 1954) * Ronald Winans (June 30, 1956-June 17, 2005) * Carvin Winans II (b. March 5, 1958) * Marvin Lawrence Winans (b.

The Winans released several hit albums and appeared in Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" before disbanding in 1995. The Winans have, however, reunited several times since their initial disbandment in 1995. Shortly after the band's disband, Ronald Winans began feeling ill. On January 31, 1997, Winans was admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital at Ann Arbor after suffering a massive heart attack due to an aortic tear. Ronald Winans was expected to die but after hours of surgery and reported lots of prayer from family members, Winans made a full recovery. Winans died of heart failure on June 17, 2005 at the age of 48. Benjamin and Priscilla were asked to sing for a Christian television program in 1982 and soon by 1984, the siblings became known as BeBe & CeCe. Over the next several years, BeBe & CeCe released several hit albums. In 1991, their Different Lifestyles went platinum and became the first album in record history to top the US gospel and pop charts. BeBe and CeCe were jointly honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to the music industry on October 20, 2011. Youngest daughters Angelique and Debra also became performers and formed the group \\"Angie & Debbie\\" in the early 1990s. Son Daniel won a Grammy for his 1989 hit \\"Brotherly Love\\". Some of Pop Winans' grandsons have also gone into music, forming \\"Winans Phase II\\", a continuation of \\"The Winans\\" in 1998. The group consists of members Marvin Winans Jr., Carvin Winans Jr., Michael Winans Jr., and Juan Winans, (son of Carvin Sr.). Winans' grandson Marvin Jr. started a production company called M2 Entertainment and produced songs for his mother Vickie Winans' album Woman To Woman. He also released a solo album entitled Image of a Man. Winans' grandson Michael Winans Jr. was convicted of fraud in connection with an $8,000,000 ponzi scheme conducted by Winans Jr. Winans Jr. and others involved, including several pastors, told their victims, some in church, that they were selling Saudi Arabian oil bonds promising 100 percent returns of his investors' money within two months. Around 1,000 individuals and companies invested in the scam and most of the money went to personal expenses or to pay off past investors. As of 2013, nearly 600 investors were still owed amounts totaling nearly $4.7 million. Winans Jr. was convicted in February 2013 and sentenced to nearly 14 years in prison. Illness and death Winans suffered a series of debilitating strokes and a massive heart attack in October 2008. In January 2009, Winans was moved from Detroit to the Alive Hospice in Nashville, Tennessee to be closer to some of his children. Winans' health worsened over the next few months and on Wednesday April 8, 2009 at around 4 pm CST, he died. Winans was 74. Winans was survived by Delores Ransom, his wife of 55 years, nine children, 23 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. Two memorial services were held for Winans at the Perfecting Church where Marvin Winans is senior pastor in Detroit. The viewing service took place on Tuesday April 14 and the homegoing service took place on Wednesday April 15. His funeral became standing room only as guests piled in the church. Several celebrities and prominent figures in gospel music attended Winans' funeral. Guests included the Williams Brothers, Tramaine Hawkins, Donnie McClurkin, Whitney Houston and Karen Clark Sheard. The Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered the eulogy. Winans was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.

Four attackers and two security forces personnel were killed in the initial battle, with an additional security force member dying from injuries hours later. The gun battle and the subsequent combing operation lasted about 17 hours on 2 January, resulting in five attackers and three security personnel dead. Further three soldiers died after being admitted to hospital with injuries, raising the death toll to six soldiers. On 3 January, fresh gunshots were heard, and another security officer was killed by an IED explosion. The operation continued on 4 January, and a fifth attacker was confirmed killed.A 6th terrorist is also believed to have been killed. Not until a final terrorist was reported killed on 5 January was the anti-terrorist operation declared over, though further searches continued for some time. The attack received wide international condemnation. Though the United Jihad Council, a Kashmir-based militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack on 4 January, the attackers, who were wearing Indian Army fatigues, were subsequently suspected to belong to Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamist militant group designated a terrorist organisation by India, the US, the UK and the UN. The attack led to a breakdown in India-Pakistan relations, which remained largely unresolved as of September 2019. Media reports suggested that the attack was an attempt to derail a fragile peace process meant to stabilise the deteriorated relations between India and Pakistan, as several pieces of evidence were found linking the attackers to Pakistan. Background On the night of 31 December 2015, at 9 pm, four men who had crossed the India Pakistan international border from Pakistan and reached the Indian side, stopped a taxi driver Ikagar Singh on the road. There was an attempt to hijack his car but he fought back leading to the hijackers killing him by slitting his throat. The tyres of the hijacked car burst after covering some distance. The armed men then proceeded to hijacked a multi-utility vehicle belonging to Salwinder Singh, a superintendent of the Punjab Police, in Dinanagar. In the process, they slit the throat of jeweller Rajesh Kumar, who was later admitted to a hospital. The vehicle was found abandoned about 500 metres away from the airbase. Later, the carjacking was reportedly linked to the attack; the carjackers did not recognise it as a police car since its lights were turned off. The Punjab Police Department refused to believe the abduction report provided by SP Salwinder Singh after he was released by the attackers, and the other survivor, Madan Gopal, was tortured by the police interrogators upon reporting the incident. Salwinder Singh had a chequered past, and his claims may have been dismissed due to his perceived unreliability. A handheld walkie talkie, was left behind by the attackers in the hijacked vehicle. It is speculated that its purpose was to aid coordination between that group and the others already at the airport and that the loss delayed the attack by twenty four hours. The attack On the morning of 1 January 2016 at around 03:30 IST, at least six heavily armed people dressed in Indian Army uniforms breached the high-security perimeter of the airbase in Pathankot. The infiltrators possibly hid, using the elephant grass in the perimeter of the campus before making the strike. A nylon rope found over the perimeter wall, looped from the ground up and then down again seemed to indicate the mode of entry. It is speculated that one of the attackers had climbed up one of the eucalyptus trees growing alongside the fence: bent it over with his weight to land on the wall. The floodlights in that stretch of the wall were apparently not working that night, which facilitated the transfer of six attackers, with some of ammunition, of grenades, and assault weapons. Reports have arisen of someone inside the base assisting the infiltration by changing the angle of floodlights near the wall where the attacker entered. They entered the living quarters of the base, but were prevented from entering the area where \\"high-value assets\\" are parked. A senior police officer said the infiltrators \\"seemed to have jumped the wall and entered the base.\\" The attackers were able to move 400 metres into the base through a forested area, before they were stopped by Garud commandos, about 700 metres away from the IAF aircraft. The attackers were carrying grenade launchers, 52 mm mortars, AK rifles and a GPS device. On 2 January, four attackers and 2 security forces personnel were killed in the initial gun battle, with another security personnel dying from injuries hours later. Fresh gunshots were heard in the subsequent combing operation indicating more attackers still at large. Three additional security personnel who were admitted to a hospital with severe injuries after an improvised explosive device blast during combing operations died on the night of 2 January 2016. Among those killed on 2 January was Commonwealth shooting medalist Subedar Fateh Singh of the Dogra Regiment who was then with the Defence Security Corps. The National Highway 44 was sealed off as soon as news of the attack broke. According to Indian intelligence officers, the attackers may have entered India on 31 December 2015 along the banks of the Beas River which cuts across the Pakistani border. The attackers were aiming to destroy the aircraft and helicopters in the base, according to a call interception report. Gunshots were heard on the morning of 3 January 2016, leading to speculation that more attackers were still in the airbase. A fresh IED explosion on 3 January injured three National Security Guard personnel. A National Security Guard officer who was injured during the blast died in a hospital. Around noon, it was discovered that two attackers were still at large in the airbase. Security forces continued the operation on 4 January with reinforcements being deployed to the location. A fifth attacker was confirmed killed later during the day. The neutralisation of the sixth attacker was reported at 4.15 PM on 5 January The operation launched by the Indian Army to neutralise the attackers was called \\"Operation Dhangu\\" or \\"Dhangu Suraksha\\", named after the place Dhangu where the base is located. Analysis Speculative reports by Times of India claimed that the people who carried out the attack in Pathankot had to be in regular touch with their handlers. Another report suggested that the two phone numbers to which calls were made by the attackers were from Pakistan. However, the dates could not confirm linkage with the live incidenthttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/92-3000597212-Phone-number- of-Pathankot-attackers-ustaad-in-Pakistan/articleshow/50490489.cms The attackers called a number at 21:12 on 31 December from the phone of taxi driver Ikaagar Singh. Perpetrators also received four phone calls on Ikaagar Singh's number. \\"On this number, in fact, the terrorist is heard telling the attacker to kill the taxi driver,\\" an official told the Times of India. One of the attackers called up his mother in the middle of attack from the mobile phone of jeweller who is a friend of the Pathankot SP - Rajesh Verma. The call was made at around 08:30, five hours after the attack was launched on the airbase. Maulana Masood Azhar, chief of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and his brother Abdul Rauf Asghar, supposed mastermind of Indian Airlines Flight IC-814 hijack case, are among four persons identified by Indian intelligence agencies as expected \\"handlers\\" behind the attack. The agencies found unreliable evidence that the conspiracy could have hatched near Lahore. Indian defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said there are indications that some of the materials used were made in Pakistan. However, since the amount of 350 kg of explosive used was virtually impossible to have been brought from across the Line of Control undetected by Indian Military Intelligence, it largely can be an expected statement to deviate the blame from the actual failure of Indian Military Intelligence. The details about potential involvement of these four persons have been agreed by Indian Government to be shared with Pakistan through proper channels, and India has pressed for stern action against them regardless of their active involvement in this current incident, as a condition for any future talks with Pakistan, the talk put on hold till a viable action is done from Pakistan's end, the sources claimed. Christine Fair states that the Pakistan Army has launched the \\"refurbished\\" Jaish-E-Mohammad to this attack, not only for the tactical benefit of derailing the nascent peace process between India and Pakistan but also for the larger strategic interests domestically and regionally.https://www.efsas.org/SADF-Article.pdf It was a way to draw back the defected groups of JeM who had turned against the Pakistani State after President Musharraf's U-turn in 2001 and direct them against India.C.

Questions were raised about the lack of clear command structure within the security forces, the long duration of the attack, high casualties, lack of co-ordination between various units and premature statements claiming the end of the attack in spite of receiving accurate intelligence about the attack. Vikram Sood, the former head of India's foreign intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wrote an article on Rediff.com citing examples of how terrorist attacks occurred in India soon after peace talks took place between India and Pakistan. Firstpost published an article on similar lines highlighting past attacks and how they adversely affected India‚ÄìPakistan relations. Research conducted by GreatGameIndia Magazine revealed that the Pathankot attack was related to the international drug mafia stretching from Afghanistan via Pakistan to India from where the drugs are shipped off to Dubai and Europe. Aftermath After the attack, the nation's capital Delhi was put on high alert. Delhi Police Special Cell received information that two people from a designated terrorist group based in Kashmir known as Jaish-e-Mohammed had entered the city. Security was tightened across the city, and additional security personnel were added in view of Republic Day Parade to be held on 26 January. New Delhi‚ÄìLucknow Swarna Shatabdi Express, which left from Delhi, was stopped and checked thoroughly after a bomb threat on 2 January. In another instance at the Mumbai airport, a Turkish Airlines plane was ordered to return from the runway to the parking area after an unclaimed mobile phone was found on a seat. New boarding passes were distributed and passengers had to undergo a full security check a second time before boarding the plane again, causing a delay of four hours. The flight landed safely in Istanbul. Mumbai, the financial capital of the country, and Hindon Air Force Station, located on the outskirts of Delhi, were also put on high alert. The Western Air Command of the Indian Air Force issued shoot-on-sight orders to all its bases in the wake of the attack. Following the attacks, the Indian and Pakistani governments both agreed to postpone scheduled diplomatic talks. Pakistani authorities reportedly arrested several members of Jaish-e-Muhammad, though not Masood Azhar, who was placed in protective detention. It was reported that Azhar's exact location was being kept secret to prevent any attempts by his followers to free him. Indian officials agreed a special team from Pakistan could travel to India to assist with the investigation. A five-member Pakistani investigation team was allowed to visit the air base on 28 March, and remained for three days to collect evidence and conduct interviews with witnesses and survivors. Pakistani investigators stated the attack had been a false-flag attack staged by the Indian government to malign Pakistan. On 26 April, India and Pakistan resumed their long-postponed diplomatic talks in New Delhi, at which the Indian foreign secretary re-emphasised the need for concrete progress into both the Pathankot and Mumbai attack investigations; Pakistan responded with a statement mentioning it had discussed \\"all outstanding issues\\" during the talks. On 3 May, the Standing Committee of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which had sent a delegation to Pathankot to investigate the attack, lambasted the central government for its poor state of preparedness and lack of effective communications between its intelligence agencies. The committee found that despite several advance warnings before the attack, no effective measures had been taken to act upon the intelligence. On 26 June, it was reported Pakistan \\"would consider\\" allowing an Indian investigation team to visit Pakistan to assist with investigations. In August, Sushma Swaraj, the Indian Minister of External Affairs, categorically ruled out any prospects of further dialogue with Pakistan until it had taken steps on \\"the Pathankot terror attack,\\" as \\"terror and talks cannot go hand-in-hand.\\" Reactions =India= President Pranab Mukherjee condemned the attack and sent condolences to the families of soldiers who lost their lives. He also sent compliments to soldiers for their valour and courage while fighting the terrorists. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also condemned the attack, saying, \\"Today, enemies of humanity who can't see India progress tried to strike at our strategic area, a prominent airbase at Pathankot. I appreciate our armed forces and thank them for foiling our enemy's attempt.\\" Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh said, \\"Pakistan is our neighbouring country. We want good relations with not just Pakistan but with all our neighbours. We also want peace, but if there is any terror attack on India, we will give a befitting reply.\\" The attack was seen as an attempt to undermine the India- Pakistan peace process. Almost all major Indian newspapers published editorials advising the Indian government to \\"stay the course\\" and not serve the purpose of the attackers by stalling or suspending the peace dialogue with Pakistan. On 14 January, several activists from the Hindu Sena, a right-wing Hindu nationalist group, vandalised the Delhi offices of Pakistan International Airlines. Shouting anti-Pakistani slogans, the activists reportedly damaged computers and furniture. At least one of the activists was arrested by police. A parliamentary panel report tabled in parliament on 3 May declared that security cover at the airbase was not robust. It mentioned that the perimeter wall was poorly guarded and the base did not have a road around it for patrolling. =Pakistan= The Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release condemning the attack and offered condolences. FO spokesman Qazi Khalilullah said. \\"Building on the goodwill created during the recent high-level contacts between the two countries, Pakistan remains committed to partner with India as well as other countries in the region to completely eradicate the menace of terrorism afflicting our region.\\" Pakistan also complained that India accused the Pakistani state of the attack. Special assistant to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Irfan Siddiqui, said, \\"India should understand that Pakistan itself had been one of the greatest victims of terrorist attacks on its soil.\\" He regretted that only after a few terrorist attacks India begins hurling baseless allegations. He advised India to review its stance by further saying, \\"India should create an environment of trust, as unfounded allegations only hamper the process of dialogue.\\" Former foreign secretary of Pakistan Riaz Khokhar said, \\"India was trying to tarnish Pakistan's image and is using such attacks to derail talks.\\" Pakistani news channel ARY News reported today that \\"some arrests\\" have been made in this regard but police did not confirm any arrest related to the Pathankot attack, as per PTI. \\"The intelligence agencies have picked up some suspects from Bahawalpur on the leads provided by India in Pathankot airbase attack and shifted them to undisclosed location for interrogation,\\" the news channel reported. =Other nations= ‚Äì President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and expressed condolences for the deaths of security personnel. * - Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali said Bangladesh would stand firmly alongside India in the fight against terrorism. * - The Brazilian government said it \\"manifestly and vehemently repudiates the attack...At the same time, [we] convey sentiments of solidarity to the families of the victims and to the government and people of India.

Wishing for the swift recovery of those wounded in the attack, he reiterated the Nepalese government's unequivocal condemnation of terrorism \\"in all its forms and manifestations, and holds the view that terrorism must be firmly and resolutely dealt with wherever and whenever it takes place.\\" He expressed his belief that the perpetrators would shortly be brought to justice. * ‚Äì The South African government condemned the attack and expressed its condolences to the victims' families. The government urged the continuation of dialogue between India and Pakistan, \\"Momentum has recently been built in efforts to enhance stability in the region through dialogue and cooperation, and all parties are urged not to allow this event to interrupt or derail the dialogue process and the goodwill created through recent high level talks. South Africa, given its history, strongly believes that there is no alternative to dialogue and talks in order to ensure that disputes are resolved peacefully.\\" * ‚Äì The South Korean government condemned the attack, stating, \\"Terrorism is a crime against humanity, and [an] inhuman act that cannot be justified in any circumstances.\\" * ‚Äì The Sri Lankan government strongly condemned the attack and expressed its condolences. \\"Sri Lanka remains committed to work with countries in the region and beyond to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\\" a government statement said. * ‚Äì Dr. Alexander Evans, Britain's acting High Commissioner to India, condemned the attack, saying, \\"The UK strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Pathankot and offers condolences to the victims and their families. We are committed to working with India and other countries around the world to combat terrorism and bring the perpetrators of terrible crimes like these to justice.\\" * ‚Äì President Barack Obama strongly condemned the attack, stating, \\"We join India in condemning the attack, saluting the Indians who fought to prevent more loss of life and extending our condolences to the victims and their families. Tragedies like this also underscore why the US and India continue to be such close partners in fighting terrorism.\\" Accepting the attack originated on Pakistani territory, Mr. Obama added, \\"Pakistan has an opportunity to show that it is serious about delegitimising, disrupting and dismantling terrorist networks. In the region and around the world, there must be zero tolerance for safe havens and terrorists must be brought to justice.\\" He described the Pathankot attack as \\"another example of the inexcusable terrorism that India has endured for too long,\\" and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for reaching out to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif after the attack. State Department spokesperson John Kirby said, \\"The United States is committed to our strong partnership with India to combat terrorism\\" and urged \\"all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous act.\\" The United States government is also keen that the attack does not disrupt the renewed talks between India and Pakistan. Kirby also expected that Pakistan will take actions against the perpetrators of the terror attack. He said, \\"The government of Pakistan has spoken very powerfully to this and it's certainly our expectation that they'll treat this exactly the way they've said they would.\\" John Kerry, US Secretary of State, requested Pakistan Prime Minister to continue the discussion with India, saying that this attack must not affect dialogue between the two countries.

He was particularly well known for his work on electromagnetic phenomenon, fine grained pressure and salinity measurements in the ocean depths and surface. Early life and education Cox was born to a Quaker family on the Hawaiian island Maui, he was the grandson of Catharine Elizabeth Bean Cox and a relative of Howard Brinton. Cox was raised on the island of Kauai in Eleele, where his father, Joel Cox, worked as a civil engineer in the McBride sugarcane plantation. He received a bachelor's degree in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1944, where he learned quantum mechanics from Linus Pauling and worked as a draftsman for William Alfred Fowler at the Kellogg Radiation Lab at Caltech on rocket development for the Navy. Cox started as a graduate student in physics at Caltech, but he became disenchanted by the development and deployment of the atomic bomb and the future of nuclear physics. In 1947 he heard a talk by a researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, an institution he had previously not known about. Following his love of the ocean he had developed growing up in Hawaii, Cox switched to study at Scripps. He received a PhD in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1954, studying under renowned physicist and oceanographer, Walter Munk. As a graduate student, he purchased a 110 ft Navy reconnaissance vessel, made surplus after World War II, and he worked as a commercial fisherman for albacore, operating this boat designed for a crew of five typically with just a single associate. His graduate adviser, Walter Munk described the experience of going to sea with him thus, \\"Skipper Cox would signal from the bridge to the engine room, then run down below to get engines going, then run on deck to release the mooring lines, etc. A few hours later, ship cook Cox would dish up a delicious luncheon.\\" Career After graduating with his PhD, Cox pursued a brief postdoctoral fellowship in Japan, before returning to Scripps to join the research staff, obtaining a joint position of assistant professor at Scripps, then was promoted to associate professor in 1960 (and received a joint appointment to UCSD which was founded that year), and then full professor in 1966. He retired from actively teaching and advising students in September 1991 and became emeritus, but retained an office at Scripps and continued to do research, including ship based research expeditions to collect data. In his later years he was very interested in the history of science, especially where it interacted with his interests in oceanography. He continued to actively research and write, including a paper on the history of oil being used to calm dangerously breaking waves, published just a few months before his death. Research Cox did early work on using light scattering to study properties of the sea surface with Walter Munk. Cox was a pioneer in the development of instrumentation of measure electro-magnetic activity on the seafloor. Developing unique measurement instruments, modeling techniques, and basic theory to both measure and understand the EM properties of the deep oceans. He then did similar work in fine scale measurements of salinity and pressure. Cox developed the differential pressure gauges used for accurately measuring pressure fluctuations on the seafloor, enabling a detailed understanding of seafloor acoustics.

Dr. Case did extensive work with Cleft Lip and Palate and is known to develop Velum Obturator. Dr. Case is famously known for his part in the Extraction Debate of 1911 that happened between Dr. Edward Angle and Dr. Case. Life He was born in Jackson, Michigan in 1847. He graduated from Fayette High School (Ohio) in Fayette, Oh in 1864. He then served in United States military during the American Civil War in 1864. After the war ended in 1865, he started studying dentistry at one of the local Dentists in Jonesville, Michigan. In 1867, he became partners with Dr. J. A. Robinson in Jackson, Michigan at his dental office. He eventually attended Ohio College of Dental Surgery and graduated from there in 1871, becoming one of the first men to graduate in Michigan state in dentistry. In 1881, he accepted a position as a Professor of Prosthetic dentistry at University of Michigan. He also studied at Medical School at University of Michigan during the same time and graduated from there in 1884. Dr. Case was married to Miss Florence Baxter in 1868. Dr. Case participated in National Archery Tournament in Chicago in 1909 and placed 2nd in the Men's Handicap Section. He was a skilled archer, as he practiced on a court at his home in Kentworth, Illinois. Dr. Case served as President of Michigan State Dental Association from 1889-1890. He then accepted a position of Professor of Prosthetic Dentistry and Orthodontics at Chicago Dental Infirmary. In 1895, he was the President of Chicago Odontological Society. He continued teaching orthodontics at Chicago College of Dental Surgery for rest of his life. Career During his life, Dr. Case published 123 articles from 1881 to 1923. His first paper was entitled Dental Education and Mechanics which was published in Ohio State Journal of Dental Science in 1881. He was author of one of the chapters in the textbook called American Textbook of Operative Dentistry in 1897. In addition he wrote several other textbooks. Dr. Case was also known to be a pioneer dentist in relation to prosthetic correction of cleft palate. In one of the papers he published in 1885 called A Method For Producing the Kingsley Cleft Palate Velum, he described a Velum Obturator that could be used with kids that have Cleft lip and palate. This obturator was self-sustaining and it restored the function of Soft palate and allowed the wearer to speak correctly. Controversy with Dr. Edward Angle Throughout his career, Dr. Case was known to have ideas that were opposite to Dr. Edward Angle. Primarily, both these figures were divisive due to their views on extraction of teeth vs non-extraction of teeth when treating malocclusions in the speciality of Orthodontics. The entire controversy between Angle and Case started when Dr. Angle claimed that the use of Intermaxillary elastics were first used by Dr. Henry Albert Baker, as opposed to first used by Dr. Case. Calvin claimed that in 1890 he started using the elastics first when he reported this use to Chicago Dental Society and Columbian Dental Congress in 1893. Dr. Martin Dewey was known to practice Orthodontics without doing any extractions. At the annual meeting of National Dental Association in 1911, later known as American Dental Association, Dr. Calvin Case and Dr. Mathew Cryer had a debate against Dr. Edward Angle, Dr. Martin Dewey, Dr. Albert H. Ketcham who represented the \\"New School\\" at the Extraction Debate of 1911. During this debate. Dr. Case presented an article called The question of Extraction in Orthodontia which was followed by discussions by different Orthodontists. Case's premise later inspired Charles Tweed in the 1940s to promote premolar extraction and extraction as the ideal way to prepare a patient for orthodontic treatment: 4 healthy adult premolars are extracted and the rest of the teeth are pulled back with rubber bands. Premolar extraction rose to popularity in the 1970s, when up to 60% percent of all patients were routinely treated with the Tweed technique. At the same time, it was observed in research published in the AJO-DO that this technique led to the retrusion of the jaws, \\"flattened\\" profile, and reduced vertical dimension. The controversy about extraction reached its peak in 1986 when a young woman sued her orthodontist for the \\"mutilation\\" of her face due to the extraction treatment, and the severe jaw pained it caused (cf Susan Brimm case). Subsequent research has failed to support this theory. In other parts of the world, the Calvin-Tweed extraction method is still used in up to 80% of orthodontic cases, and Tweed and Case are celebrated as pioneers in the field. The controversy, to date, has never been resolved.

Early life and career Robert Leslie was born on December 18, 1885 in New York City‚Äôs Lower East Side to Louis Leslie, a Scottish seaman who converted to Judaism and married a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania. He entered the workforce at 14, working for a Russian intellectual and printer where he learned to love typography, printing, and to speak fluent Russian. In 1900, he enrolled at the City College of New York, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1904. He went on to attend Johns Hopkins University, where he received his M.D. in 1912. In addition to his scholarship, he worked for the printing office of Theodore Low DeVinne to pay for tuition. His first job was working for the United State Public Health Service where he redesigned government publications in Maryland. He also became an expert on bubonic plague through volunteer service at Ellis Island. In 1918, he married Dr. Sarah Greenberg, a gynecologist, obstetrician, and the first woman in New York City to be licensed by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Career  The couple moved back to New York in 1920, where Leslie was employed by the McGraw Hill Company as the first industrial doctor in the city. At McGraw Hill, he met Sol Cantor, a printer for the Carey Printing Company. The men became business partners, forming The Composing Room, Inc. in 1927. The Composing Room employed advanced type-setting methods that boasted quick turnarounds and high-quality work for high-circulation magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair, and House and Garden. The Composing Room worked directly with font foundries like Linotype and encouraged ligatures to be created for bad letter combinations. It was the first typography house to be able to produce a range of font sizes (5-144pt) at all times; a proofing press for transparencies; and the first to install the All-Purpose-Linotype (APL) machines. In 1934, the type shop created their own magazine, called PM (later A-D magazine) with co- editor Percy Seitlin for art directors and production people. The magazine was a bi-monthly promotional publication produced between 1934 and 1942. It expressed Leslie‚Äôs desire to identify and explore new approaches in graphic arts while creating a market for good machine typesetting. The magazine gave young designers a platform for their experiments and helped to launch and expand the careers of many by making design accessible to businesses. It was suspended in 1942 in light of World War II and was never resumed. In 1936, Leslie worked with Hortense Mendel to create Gallery 303. It was intended to showcase new American artists and emigres from Europe who were fleeing Nazi Germany. And in 1965, began a lecture series through the gallery, called the Heritage of Graphic Arts. He also set up a graphic arts salon that leaders of the industry including Ladislav Sutnar, Alvin Lustig and Herbert Bayer could discuss design and talk shop. In the 1950s, he was instrumental in the creation of the High School of Industrial Arts (later renamed the High School of Art and Design) in New York City. He also founded a paper mill and artist colony in Beer Sheva, Israel, in the old Turkish railway station. in 1969, Leslie retired for the Composing Room and AIGA awarded him the AIGA medal. Later that year, he became president of Typophiles, an organization of book lovers. In 1972, he was awarded the Type Directors Club Medal. In 1973, he received the Goudy award from RIT.

Survakane is a tradition performed with a decorated stick, known as a survaknitsa or survachka, on New Year's Day, as a measure for health during the year.

This much is clear about the origins of the tradition, although exactly when, where, or by whom it was practiced first is still a matter of debate. =Ritual= Survakane proper is a ritual in which a member of the family, typically the youngest, lightly pats the back of others with a survaknitsa during Christmas or on the morning of New Year's Day (known in Bulgarian as Vasilovden).Vasilovden is the name day of the name Vasil, among others, and falls on January 1. While doing this, he or she recites a short verse wishing their relative well for the new year. The members of the family (usually children) who do the ritual are known as survakari or survakarcheta. Afterwards, these children are awarded snacks, candy, or small amounts of money.

The survaknitsa or survachka is a curled branch of a cornel tree (), usually decorated with coins, popcorn, dried fruits, small bagels, ribbons, and threads, although different decorations are used in different regions of Bulgaria. Typically, northern Bulgarian survaknitsas will have fruits, bread, and seeds strung on them, while coins are used in the south. The branches are usually bent so as to resemble the Cyrillic letter \\"f\\" (–§). The selection process for a branch is usually held a few days before New Year's, in order to have time to decorate the stick as the family sees fit. The branch can be taken from any live fruit tree, although dogwood is preferred because of its long life and early blossoming, which are supposed to represent desirable qualities.

He also fought at the US-hosted undercard of The Rumble in the Jungle as a professional boxer, but he will be best remembered as the first trainer for Mike Tyson, who discovered Tyson's tremendous potential and introduced him to boxing. Early years Stewart was raised in Amsterdam, New York. Amateur boxing career His amateur boxing record was 45‚Äì5 when he turned pro in 1974 being managed by Cus D'Amato., The Berkshire Eagle, September 21, 1974, p. 16. Professional boxing career Stewart left the ring in 1977 with a professional record of 13 wins and 3 losses. Professional boxing record Juvenile detention counselor work He was working as a juvenile detention counselor in Perth, NY when Mike Tyson sought him out for training as a boxer. Tyson was in the Tryon Residential Center for Boys when he contacted Stewart. Stewart set conditions for working with Tyson that included better behavior and academic achievement. Tyson met Stewart's conditions and they began to work together. Stewart said, ‚ÄúHe was a complete gentleman as he wanted to fight so bad.‚Äù Stewart also noticed Mike's physique; at 13, the young detainee from Brooklyn weighted 190 pounds while standing only 5 feet 8 inches tall. Stewart told a friend, ‚ÄúSome have made him out to be a 120 pound weakling or something like that before I got hold of him but he wasn‚Äôt anything like that. I could tell he was strong and later I found out just how strong he really was.‚Äù His powerful build suggested boxing potential to Stewart and Tyson's work ethic strengthened that opinion. Stewart loved working with troubled youth and he believed that boxing could be a way out of trouble for the kids he worked with. Soon it became evident to Stewart that his 13-years-old trainee was punching so hard for his age, that he had a natural talent and a great potential to become a champion:Mike Tyson - The Fallen Champ (The Untold Story), ESPN. > Mike and I were sparring one time. He hit me with a jab that almost knocked > me down. Luckily, I had the next week off from Tryon, because my nose was > broken, my eyes were all black. Stewart took him to Cus D'Amato, a legendary trainer in the Catskill Mountains of New York, who had previously worked with Floyd Patterson. Stewart first took Tyson to D'Amato about once a week. In 1982, D'Amato was 72 and he took Tyson into his home and trained him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. D'Amato along with his head trainer Teddy Atlas prepared Tyson for a professional boxing career that included 58 bouts, 49 wins, just 4 losses, and 44 knockouts.Cashmore, Ellis. Tyson:Nurture of the Beast As the D'Amato's gym didn't have any heavyweight or light heavyweight of a comparable size and weight at the moment Tyson arrived, Stewart, on Atlas' request, again stepped into the ring as the Tyson's sparring partner. Tyson, realising that this was his chance for a new life, went ferocious after Bobby. Stewart later recalled: > He was perfect . . . aggressive as hell. In 1986, at age 20, \\"Iron\\" Mike Tyson became the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in history. It all started at Tryon with Bobby Stewart. Stewart and Tyson were reunited at D'Amato's gym in the Catskills for a Fox Sports video shoot in 2013. Stewart's last time with Tyson was later in 2013 when the former champ sent a limousine to pick up his first boxing mentor in Amsterdam, New York and bring him to Westbury, Long Island to see Tyson's one man show.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1880 by Southall & Tracey. It is also known as Australian Bank of Commerce Limited and Australian Joint Stock Bank. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Australian Joint Stock Bank, Mackay, circa 1882 The Commonwealth Bank building was constructed in 1880 for the Australian Joint Stock Bank and is the oldest commercial building in Mackay. The Australian Joint Stock Bank was established with the discovery of gold in southern states in 1852 and opened branches on Queensland goldfields as they were discovered. It opened a branch on the Broughton goldfield on 23 April 1872 and then established branches in other centres. The Mackay branch was opened in this building in 1881. The town of Mackay is named for John Mackay who entered the valley of the Pioneer River in 1860 and established a pastoral run there in the following year. In 1862 a settlement was begun on the south bank of the river and by 1863, the township had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a port of entry and a customs house was opened. The town prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre, drawing business from nearby pastoral holdings and the sugar plantations being developed along the river. The 1880s saw an expansion in population as the Queensland economy enjoyed a boom and people poured into the colony. The sugar industry was also booming and Mackay continued to develop as an important regional centre. The new Australian Joint Stock Bank was one of a number designed by Queensland Colonial Architect F D G Stanley, although the construction was supervised by Brisbane architect Arthur Josling. Stanley undertook a variety of private commissions during his term with the Queensland Public Works Department and knew Josling from his employment by the Department as a temporary draughtsman between November 1878 and June 1879. Brisbane builders Southall and Tracey carried out the work. Construction began in January 1880 and the bank opened on 5 February 1881. Although suffering a devastating cyclone in 1918, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth through the 1920s and 1930s, when it was the fastest growing town in Queensland. This was largely because its connection to the railway system in 1924 improved access to markets and reduced transport costs, thus boosting not only the sugar industry but also the developing dairy and tourist industries. The Australian Joint Stock Bank Limited had become the Australian Bank of Commerce in 1910 and traded under that name until 1931 when it was acquired by the Bank of New South Wales. In 1934 the Commonwealth Savings Bank moved into the building. The Queensland Government Savings Bank established an agency in the Mackay Post Office on 3 January 1865. The Bank had been established in 1861 and was intended to encourage small deposit saving by working people. In 1864, the Savings Bank Bill provided a government guarantee to protect trustees and deposits and to allow depositors to easily transfer accounts. The Queensland Government Savings Bank merged with the Commonwealth Savings Bank in January 1921. The Mackay branch then leased the Customs House until they moved to the former Australian Bank of Commerce building. The interior has been considerably changed by a series of refits and renovations carried out over the years. Since 2014 the building has fallen into disrepair, after the Department of Heritage Protection forced builders to stop work because the owner Mr Arman hadn't applied properly to have repairs carried out. Negotiations since then have gone nowhere and even a 'show cause' notice from the department to Mr Arman was unanswered. As of January 2020 no repair or remedial work to stabilise the building has been undertaken. The buildings outer has been stripped back to bare bricks and is un-protected from the weather. Irreversible damage has now begun and it is feared the building will be lost . The local Regional Council has come under severe criticism from the public for taking no actions to preserve the building.  Description  The bank building, now occupied by the Commonwealth Bank is, in keeping with other North Queensland bank buildings of the period, a two-storey building with a former residence on the upper floor. An extension has been attached on the east. The ground floor windows are modified within their surrounds with modern glazing and frames. The night safe is located in the front, on the left hand side. The front consists of a seven bay colonnade, of which the central bay is slightly narrower, but contains the entry and features a projecting one-storey portal, the entablature of which is free standing. The columns are round and stand on pedestals joined with a low wall. The entablature above the columns is enriched with classical triglyphs. The two central columns are positioned forward of the others as corner posts of the portal, the back of which is formed by square pillars topped by an arch. The upper storey has more slender cast iron columns above the masonry lower ones, holding up the veranda roof of corrugated iron. The balustrade is formed with cast iron lace with a pattern based on overlapping circles. The main roof is hipped, it's ridge at right angles to the street. Arched windows connect the veranda with the upper floor, containing paired glazed doors; the top pane of each is arched also. The roof is clad in corrugated iron and has a decoratively moulded chimney rises on the left side. The stucco on both levels is ruled to resemble ashlar masonry. The lower veranda is ceiled with boards. The upper floor is also lined with boards. These differ being run on the rake, are narrow and contain a rib mould at each joint. The bank chamber has a central main door as well as two further doors, which may be former windows with sills removed.  Heritage listing  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mackay, as an important sugar centre, made a major contribution to the economy of Queensland and to the development of the North in the late 19th century The Commonwealth Bank, by the quality of its design and construction, demonstrates the importance of this regional branch and the prosperity of the city at that time. It is now the oldest commercial building in Mackay. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Commonwealth Bank building is a good example of its type and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, from the reassuring conservatism of the classically influenced design, to the layout, which provided a residence for the bank's manager on the upper floor. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It was designed by one of Queensland's most influential architects and has aesthetic value as a prominent and finely detailed building that makes an important contribution to the townscape of Mackay The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Commonwealth Bank, originally built for the Australian Joint Stock Bank, is important as a major commercial building by F.D.G. Stanley, who made a significant contribution to the development of the built environment in Queensland, both as the Colonial Architect and in private practice. It is also associated with the development of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, at one time the largest bank in Queensland.

It was built during the reign of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Djet, in the First Dynasty (Early Dynastic Period), shortly after 3000 BC. It is one of the largest mastabas from this dynasty. The building was excavated in 1953 by Walter Bryan Emery.  Structure  The building is made of dried mudbricks and is 56.45 metres long and 25.45 metres wide.Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II, p. 8 The original height is unknown. The mastaba was decorated on the outside with a palace facade (also called a niche facade). On the long sides there were eleven niches, but on the short sides, only four. The facade was painted white, the innermost niches red.Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II, p. 9 The mastaba was enclosed by a wall and stood on a low platform, on which models of cattle heads with real cattle horns were found. Around the tomb there were up to 65 subsidiary tombs. The actual mastaba superstructure contained 43 chambers. Below this was the burial chamber, which was surrounded by additional store rooms. The burial chamber itself was originally clad in gilt wood.Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II, pp. 9-12  Grave goods  Finding with the serekh of pharaoh Djet and the name of the official Sekhemkasedjet, from S3504Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II, p. 104, Fig. 106 Although the tomb was robbed in antiquity, several items were found. In particular, in the storage chambers, the remains of c. 2500 pottery vessels were preserved. Valuable offerings were originally housed in the underground chambers. There are many remains of furniture, which include elaborate wooden carvings, copper and stone tools, and c. 1500 stone vessels. Many of the vessels were originally sealed with clay stoppers. The sealings are an important historical source. Several of them name the King Djet, but some also bear the name of the last king of the First Dynasty, Qa'a,Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II, p. 127 under whom the grave was refurnished after being robbed for the first time.  Occupant  The identification of the tomb owner was long debated in scholarship. The excavator Emery considered it the tomb of Djet, while more recent research suggests the official Sekhemkasedj as the tomb owner, since his name appears in several inscriptions found here. Another possibility is the tomb belonged to Sewedj-ka, the Seal Bearer of the King of Lower Egypt.  Bibliography  Walter B. Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty II.

It was wrecked at Hassell Beach in Cheyne Bay near Cape Riche when a gale ran it ashore 7 November 1849. History The Arpenteur was built using wood at Mahe in the Seychelles in 1839. It was originally registered in Port Louis in Mauritius. The vessel was purchased in 1847 by Owen and Ridley, who had it re- registered at Port Adelaide. The vessel was used to transport cargo between Singapore, Java and Adelaide. In 1848 the Arpenteur, in the command of Captain Allen, was used to salvage the Wave, which was wrecked at Cheynes Beach. The owners of the Arpenteur acquired the salvage rights for the wreck of the Wave for ¬£330. When it returned to Fremantle the Arpenteur had 27 tons of flour, 1,000 bushels of wheat, the rigging and sails that the crew had salvaged from the wreck. On its final voyage the brig was in the command of Captain John Raines and was being used to transport mail from England that had been collected at Singapore and was to be delivered at Fremantle. Unable to enter Fremantle harbour due to storms, it sailed on to Albany but was unable to enter King George Sound as a result of strong gales and was damaged in the process. Eventually the ship reached Cheynes Beach where it was in the process of loading whale oil when strong gales rose from the south west blowing the vessel ashore so that it foundered and was wrecked. All of the crew escaped and a small portion of the cargo was salvaged. Wreck The wreck is located approximately offshore at the western end of Hassell Beach and lies on a flat sandy bottom. Used as a dive site, approximately of planking and framework is visible along with some rounded stone ballast.

During a time when few women were painters, she exhibited regularly for nearly 30 years at the Paris Salon, the major art event of the time. Two of her sons became sculptors, and a daughter exhibited with her at the Paris exhibition as a painter.  Family  Marie Ang√©lique Foulon was born in 1793 to Nicolas Foulon and Madeleine Marotte du Coudray. Nicolas Foulon was an apostate Benedictine monk, who at one point drew up a French breviary to replace the Roman Catholic one. He left and was expelled from the Jansenist monastery of Blancs-Manteaux in Paris at the time of the French Revolution. His revolutionary political involvement reportedly included being bailiff at the Council of 500, and serving in the Tribunat and Senate. Madeleine Marotte du Coudray had been raised in a severe Jansenist family. Because of opposition from her family, the couple lived together for several years and had at least one child before formally declaring their union in a civil ceremony on January 11, 1793, as a mariage provisoire. Marie Ang√©lique was the second of their four children. Her older sister, also named Marie, was born September 24, 1791, and is noted in the marriage declaration. Marriage and Career Jeune Fille by Ang√©lique Mezzara By 1813, Marie Ang√©lique Foulon, \\"an artiste peintre\\" was married to Thomas Fran√ßois Gaspard Mezzara, also known as Francis or Francesco Mezzara (1774‚ÄìFebruary 3, 1845). The couple lived in Paris at 16 Rue d'Enfer as of 1813, and at 89 Rue de Charonne as of 1818. Although identified at the time of his marriage as a \\"peintre d'histoire\\", his works were rejected when he submitted them to the Paris Salon in 1842 and 1844. A self-portrait was the only painting by Francesco Mezzara known to exist as of 2014. There are suggestions that his main source of income was as a dealer in art and antiquities. The couple traveled briefly in the United States in 1817 and again in 1819. Their first son, Joseph-Ernest-Am√©d√©e Mezzara (March 2, 1820 ‚Äì 1901) was born in New York. Their second son, Pierre-Alexandre-Louis Mezzara (December 9, 1825 ‚Äì January 30, 1883) was born in √âvreux, France. A daughter, Marie-Ad√®le Angiola Mezzara (August 1, 1828-) was born in Paris. It is possible that another daughter, Cl√©mentine, may have been born in the United States. Contemporary sources suggest that the marriage was not happy: Pierre- Jean de B√©ranger wrote to David d'Angers that Madame Mezzara supported her \\"nombreuse famille\\" through her work as a painter, referring to \\"L'histoire des malheurs de la mere\\" (the story of the misfortunes of the mother). Certainly, Madame Mezzara worked steadily as an artist after her children were born, and after her husband died in 1845.\\"D√©c√®s,\\" February 3, 1845, V3E/D 1056, Archives d√©partementales, Archives de Paris. As early as 1825, in √âvreux, she was painting portraits. The Database of Salon Artists (1827-1850) indicates that she submitted work to the Paris Salon as early as 1827, though she was not accepted in that year. In 1833, she submitted 5 works, of which 4 were accepted. From then on, most of her submissions were accepted. These included both drawings and pastels. A list of her works in the Dictionnaire g√©n√©ral des artistes de l'√©cole fran√ßaise indicates that she exhibited at the Paris Salon almost every year from 1833 to 1852. This was a substantial achievement, given the restrictions facing women artists of the time. By 1834, the Salon records her as living at 75 Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Martin. She was mentioned with other artists, including the women \\"de Mmes de Varennes, Clotilde G√©rard, Fanny Allaux, Laure de L√©om√©nil et Ang√©lique Mezzara\\" in Annuaire historique universel, pour 1839. In La phalange: revue de la science sociale, she and other women portrait painters at the Salon of 1845 were mentioned: \\"mesdames Armide Lepeut, Sophie Rude ; Nina Bianchi , Elisa Blondel, √âlisa Bernard, Ang√©lique Mezzara\\". The women's works were also commended as being more expressive than those exhibited by the men. One of Ang√©lique Mezzara's portraits was shown in the ninth annual exhibition of the Artists' Fund Society of Philadelphia in 1844. She is identified as living in Philadelphia at that time, but nothing is known about how long she may have stayed in the United States. It is possible that she translated a novel, La R√™ve de la Vie, from English to French, for publication in 1858.  Children  Both of her sons became artists. Joseph Mezzara was both a sculptor and a painter, portraying prominent contemporary figures. Although his earliest submissions to the Paris Salon were refused, a number of his marble portrait busts were accepted by the Paris Salon between 1852 and 1875. Joseph Mezzara married Mathilde Leenhoff in 1856. Mathilde was a sister of Suzanne Leenhoff, who had a complicated relationship with √âdouard Manet. Joseph's sons Francois Mezzara and Charles Mezzara, and Charles' wife Florence Koechlin, are also listed as painters and students of Joseph Mezzara in Dictionnaire g√©n√©ral des artistes.Steppes, Michael; Klimt, Andreas.

He lived in San Francisco, and was known for his work as a cameo cutter. He created the first memorial statue of Abraham Lincoln. It was dedicated (in plaster) in San Francisco in 1866, and destroyed (in bronze) by the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Pietro Mezzara was involved with the California Art Union and the San Francisco Art Association, and helped found the San Francisco School of Design. Cl√©mentine Mezzara, who exhibited watercolors at the Salon in 1847 and 1848, may have been a daughter of Ang√©lique.

While it has a special focus on Cuban and Street Art, it also present works such as Pre-Columbian, Old Masters, Impressionists, Modern, Contemporary, Latin American, European, and American Art. The Gallery was founded by art dealer Nicole Henry in 2006. The gallery, and Ms. Henry, have gained an international following, and she has been recognized both for her skills as a curator of fine art and for her ability to identify and nurture the careers of emerging young artists. Biography of founder After graduating from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, with a BFA in Art History and Studio Art, Nicole Henry was granted a treasury license from the U.S. government in 2001 to travel to Cuba and bring back Cuban Art. She was able to amass a large Cuban Collection over the next several years and, in 2006, opened her first Art Gallery in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. She built the business to profitability and in 2011 moved from its initial location to its present location in West Palm Beach. Nicole has represented a variety of artists in global markets and has earned an international clientele among high-net-worth-clients, building strong customer loyalty and a large referral base. She is recognized as an important player in the South Florida art collector community. An interesting new project for Nicole has been the Canvas Art Fund, which she formed in 2016. This is a hedge fund specializing in identifying, procuring, and marketing blue-chip fine art pieces that are distressed because of such issues as bankruptcies, fire sales, and divorces. She is able to acquire such art at significant discounts and resell them at real market value, frequently displaying them at Nicole Henry Fine Art. In 2015, Nicole formed a 501(c)(3) called CANVAS Art Charities, a non-profit organization funding the visual arts to enrich the community through public installations, exhibitions, education and events. The organization hosts the annual CANVAS Outdoor Museum Show in downtown West Palm Beach, during which site-specific installations and large-scale murals were created around Downtown on select buildings and infrastructure in various locations such as the City Hall Courtyard, Royal Park Bridge, Fern Street, and The Whitney. The 3 shows to date have added more than $3,000,000 in public art to West Palm Beach‚Äôs landscape and turned it into an important destination. Nicole is also strongly committed to her community and has been a key player in raising more than $2,000,000 for local charities over the past 3 years. For several years a board member of, Place of Hope a rescue mission for abused and neglected children. She co-chaired their gala in 2013 and was the honorary co-chair in 2014.

S. Ayres \\"Import Fair\\" and later became a leading mural artist in Downtown Indianapolis, a well-known screen printing artist, and educator. Biography =Early life and education= Roland O. Hobart was a native of Innsbruck, where he studied mural painting at an early age. He then toured for a year in Europe working at different galleries before enrolling in the Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste Wien and opening a printing business. =Shelbyville= Hobart moved to Shelbyville, Indiana, in 1966 from Austria and lived on the property of Richard and Thelma ('Tee') Fleming, who helped arrange for him to stay and sponsored his art production. In Shelbyville, Hobart set up a studio just off one of the city's main streets and remained there until the 1980s. He was well known in Shelbyville for his work with children, famously designing an sculpture for a number of Shelbyville Senior High School proms in the early 1970s. In 1972, Hobart designed the Shelby County flag as part of the 1972 Shelby County Sesquicentennial celebration. The green and blue flag featured \\"Indiana symbols for Shelby County's famous cornfields, two bears symbolizing 'The Bears of Blue River,' and a diagonal blue stripe symbolizing the waters of Big Blue River which cut through the county\\". =Indianapolis= Indianapolis Sesquicentennial work While Hobart worked as an artist for L.S. Ayres, his first significant commissioned came in 1970 from the Indianapolis Sesquicentennial Commission, when he was asked to create five original prints for the celebration of the Indianapolis Sesquicentennial (1971). Each of the five prints, which were unveiled in May 1971 represent an important aspect of the city. * The first print is a five-point star encompassed by a circle representing the city's progress and its plans for the future. * The second print features a sequence of consecutive diamond and circle shapes enclosed in a larger circle, \\"echoes a feeling of sound waves\\" to symbolized the social progress of both the city and its surrounding environment. * The third print is a representation of the Indianapolis 500, a monumental event for Indianapolis communities. * The fourth print depicts two stars within a large \\"I\\", enclosed by a circle. The number \\"150\\" crosses the middle of the print. This work represents the patriotism of Indianapolis and the 150 years the sesquicentennial honors. * The fifth print depicts converging arrows within a circle, signifying Indianapolis as the \\"Crossroads of America.\\" All five prints simultaneously represent downtown Indianapolis's Monument Circle, both a local and national identifier of the city. The prints were originally for sale and on view at L. S. Ayres and Jaycees office in downtown Indianapolis. At the same time as the Sesquicentennial prints, Hobart also produced an original work for the International Conferences on Cities, a conference held in May 1971 and organized by J. Irwin Miller and Richard Lugar. This print depicts a view of the world from space, centered in a large \\"I\\" for Indianapolis. Hobart chose this design to represent all the nations present at the Conference on Cities. Urban Walls In August 1973 Hobart was selected as the first winner of the Urban Walls design contest, which was sponsored by National Endowment for the Arts and American Fletcher National Bank. The contest was judged by Carl Solway of Solway Galleries in Cincinnati, sponsor of the Urban Walls project there, Benjamin deBrie Taylor of the Herron School of Art, and Sylvia Zazas of Indianapolis. Other projects In the summer of 1973, Hobart's silk screen prints were displayed at the L.S. Ayres & Company Auditorium in downtown Indianapolis as part of a two-artist show.Garme, Marion Simon, \\"Hobart art in Ayres auditorium\\", \\"The Indianapolis News\\", 13 June 1973. The prints displayed were created using his own unique silk screening process which entails using the squeegee like a paint brush to apply texture to the print.Garmel, Marion Simon, ‚ÄúArtist perfecting silk- screen process‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Indianapolis News‚Äù, 6 August 1979. In 1975, Hobart created a mural for the Great Hall of the Phi Kapp Psi fraternity on the campus of Wabash College. That same year he also served as the Visual Artist- in-Residence for the Indiana Boys' School to produce murals on the interior of the building with a grant from the Indiana Arts Commission and provide instructions in silk screen printing to allow the boys to create their own T-shirt designs. Hobart continued helping youth in Indianapolis create murals as part of the Urban Walls through 1976. From 1976 to 1977 he taught at the Herron School for Art and Design as an adjunct professor.Herron School of Art and Design Records, 1902‚Äì2006, Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives, University Library, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis In 1979, Hobart created two graphics of President Jimmy Carter, one sweating and one shivering.

It was designed by A E Harding Frew and built in 1936. It is also known as Pump Stations. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 July 2009.  History  The sewerage works in East Gordon Street, one of the first in Queensland, was opened by George Moody, Mayor of Mackay, on 25 January 1936. The consulting engineer was AE Harding Frew. Mackay began as a settlement on the south bank of the Pioneer River serving pastoral holdings. By 1863 it had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a port of entry and a customs house was opened. Sugar cane was introduced in 1865 and by the mid-1880s this was the major industry in the area. Mackay prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre. From the end of the nineteenth century until well after World War II, basic services in regional Queensland were progressively upgraded. Reticulated water supplies, sewerage systems and electricity were introduced into regional towns beginning with the major centres. Planning for Brisbane's sewerage system was underway by 1909. A sewerage scheme was introduced at Toowoomba in 1925, and development of a sewerage scheme at Rockhampton commenced in 1936. Most other regional centres did not have sewerage systems provided until after World War Two, with some local government areas waiting until the 1960s-1980s. Mackay's sewerage system, opened in January 1936, was among the first in regional Queensland. The system was introduced at a time when Mackay was undergoing a major public works program to improve the infrastructure of the town and upgrade the harbour. A number of factors prompted this program. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth, even during the period of financial hardship and unemployment caused by the Depression. It was the fastest-growing town in Queensland, with its population almost doubling between 1923 and 1940. This was largely due to the linking of Mackay by the North Coast railway line to Rockhampton in 1921 and to Townsville in 1923. This improved access to markets and reduced transport costs, boosting not only the sugar industry, but also the developing dairy and tourist industries. Another contributing factor was that the local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, William Forgan Smith, was Premier of Queensland between 1932 and 1940 and he supported the growth of the region. It was hoped that the public works program, including the Outer Harbour scheme, would make Mackay one of Queensland's most frequented beauty spots and that, as an attractive modern city, it would become a base for those visiting Eungella and the islands. The city council commissioned a town plan from Ronald McInnes in 1934. It was based on Britain's Town Planning Act of 1932 and was the first town plan designed for an existing city in Queensland, serving as a model for other cities for many years. The Mackay City Council undertook an ambitious plan for the beautification and modernisation of the city. The scheme included the provision of new parks, kerbing and channelling, new water mains, a new powerhouse and the establishment of the sewerage system. At the opening of the East Gordon Street Sewerage Works on 25 January 1936 the chairman of the Mackay Harbour Board, Charles Frederick Bagley, paid tribute to the city council for its initiative in carrying out the scheme and to the consulting engineer AE Harding Frew who designed it. Alison Eavis Harding Frew (1883-1952) was a prominent Queensland civil engineer. Harding Frew's designed about 80 bridges throughout Queensland during his career. He was a consulting engineer in Melbourne during the 1920s and on the Pyrmont Power House at Sydney in the early 1940s. He was a consultant on the 1926 Brisbane Cross River Commission and was the designing engineer for the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane, from November 1926 to 1932. From 1932 to 1935 he was the engineer for bridge construction on the Hornibrook Highway project, the bridge linking Sandgate and Redcliffe. Frew's design for the fully automated pump houses at Mackay, featuring castellated parapets, encompasses one of the basic principles of civil engineering, which is to design creative solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. At the opening of the works Bagley reiterated the view of the day that, with the completion of the sewerage works and the Outer Harbour Scheme, Mackay would become even more important, and the Government Medical Officer, Dr Ernest Wesley Chenoweth, emphasised the public health advantages of the new sewerage scheme. Sewage was pumped to the site via concrete or glazed pipes, where it was held in a well and treated with chlorine before being pumped out to sea at high tide. The main elements of sewage treatment included the separation of solids from fluids by screening and allowing the solids to settle in a tank. The solids were drawn off and disposed of, and the fluids were often treated before being discharged into a waterway or the ocean. Chlorine was used as a disinfectant. By December 1933 a total of of sewer main, including a main crossing at Sandfly Creek near the East Gordon Street site, had been pegged out. Tenders had also been let for the construction of the pump well and pump house, the supply and installation of pump machinery, and the construction of the chlorinator. The smaller building (the chlorinator) toward the front of the site is now used for storage. The larger building is still in use as a pump station with a submersible pump external to the structure and a switchboard inside the building. A modern deodoriser has been installed next to this building. Sewage is pumped from the station at East Gordon Street to a pump station in Sydney Street. The East Gordon Street works forms part of a major network of 135 pump stations throughout Mackay and they are associated with a sewer main of more than , which ultimately connects to one of three waste water treatment plants in the city. Mackay Water, a business unit of Mackay City Council (now of the Mackay Regional Council), is responsible for the management of Mackay's sewerage scheme.  Description  The 1936 Sewerage Works is located on a level allotment in East Gordon Street, Mackay. The two principal early structures on the site are the pump house and chlorinator building. These are small, white, concrete buildings with castellated parapets. The larger is to the rear and the smaller to the front of the block. The buildings are constructed from off-form concrete with a horizontal, wide- board pattern showing. Vent stacks are built as miniature towers at some corners of the structures; other corners have matching engaged buttresses. They sit on concrete tanks, their floors about above the ground. The smaller building (chlorinator) is rectangular in plan with the longer elevations facing south-west and north-east. Two square, metal-framed windows, covered with metal shutters open into both of these elevations. A square window into the north-west elevation is also covered with sheeting. The entrance to the building, in the south-east elevation, is via a concrete stair which ascends parallel to the wall finishing at a concrete landing. A wooden door opens from the landing. This is secured with a knob and a more recent lock. The top of the tank under the smaller building forms a raised semicircular concrete plinth which extends to the south-west. The tank contains a chamber with a tapered floor. Internally, the building comprises a single room with unpainted concrete walls. It contains two large items of early machinery. One of these has a small brass name plate bearing the words \\"Filtration and water softening system\\". The larger building (pump house) is also rectangular in plan with the long elevations facing south-west and north-east. Access to the building is via a concrete stair to the narrow, south-east elevation. The stair ascends at right angles to the wall finishing at a long landing. At the top of the landing, a double metal door opens into the interior. It has a curved handle and is secured by a barrel bolt. A plaque above the door commemorates the commissioning of the works on 25 January 1936. The opposite elevation has a single small, metal- framed glass window with nine panes. The south-west elevation has three square, steel-framed windows. These pivot around a horizontal axis at mid-height. The top of the tank attached to the side of the building projects to form a rectangular plinth. A steel stairway ascends at right angles to the south-eastern side of the tank finishing close to the wall of the building. Four metal shafts project from the top of the tank. Three of these have metal wheels fitted to the top; threaded lengths of rod extend above these wheels. Hinged, steel panels provide access into the tanks. The opposite (north-east) elevation has two square windows and a narrow hatchway around in height. The windows are covered with sheeting which is boxed out from the wall a short distance. Two metal plates are bolted over the hatchway; a large square plate above a smaller rectangular one. Both plates have curved handles at each end. The top of the tank forms a rectangular plinth extending from this elevation. There are small rectangular and arched openings into the base of the north-eastern end of the plinth. Internally, the larger building is painted light grey on the lower part of the wall and pale green above, separated by a black band. The floor comprises a series of steel plates with a metal ladder descending to a sub-floor area that is now disused. The building contains a grey cabinet housing electrical equipment. This is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The building also contains a manually operated overhead crane. Transverse movement of the crane is achieved by means of a simple chain and wheel mechanism. A similar chain and wheel raises and lowers a hook. This mechanism comprises a pulley and two back-to-back hooks. One of the hooks secures the mechanism to the overhead cross beam of the crane; the other dangles downwards for holding the load.  Heritage listing  East Gordon Street Sewerage Works was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 July 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The East Gordon Street Sewerage Works in Mackay, opened in 1936, was one of the first in regional Queensland. As such, it is important in demonstrating the progressive upgrading of basic infrastructure in regional Queensland, in particular the provision of sewerage schemes, which took place in regional towns and cities from the interwar period. Most other regional centres did not develop such schemes until after World War II, with some local government areas not constructing sewerage infrastructure until after 1960. As one of the first sewerage works in regional Queensland, it is tangible evidence of the importance of Mackay as a regional centre in the 1930s and the influence the city enjoyed through their local Member of Parliament, William Forgan Smith, who was Premier at the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay was the fastest growing town in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a sewage treatment works of the interwar period. Characteristics include pump house, chlorination plant building, and the deliberate attempt to visually disguise the true purpose of these structures through the stylistic treatment of the exterior walls with their castellated parapets, which is unusual for such utilitarian structures. The place also is important in demonstrating the work of prominent civil engineer AE Harding Frew, who designed the scheme. Frew made a substantial contribution to civil engineering infrastructure in Queensland including designing the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane.

It was published by the press of Vilnius Jesuit Academy in 1595 with financial support of Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis. The catechism is not an original work but a translation. As such, the work holds little value in terms of content, but is extremely valuable to the study of the Lithuanian language due to its lexical richness. The sole surviving copy is kept at Vilnius University Library. Earlier books There were earlier publications in Lithuanian, but they were published by Protestants in the Duchy of Prussia, including Catechism of Martynas Ma≈ævydas in 1547 and Postil of Jonas Bretk≈´nas in 1591. Earlier researchers, including Vaclovas Bir≈æi≈°ka and Zenonas Ivinskis, claimed that a translation of the catechism by Peter Canisius was published in Vilnius around 1585. That would put Dauk≈°a's catechism only as the first surviving Lithuanian-language book printed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The claim was based on two documents: a 1589 letter to Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, and foreword of the 1605 catechism printed in Vilnius. Upon careful analysis, it is likely that the letter referred to Latvian translation of Canisius' catechism, instigated by papal legate Antonio Possevino, translated by , and published in Vilnius in 1585. It is the oldest surviving book in the Latvian language. The foreword of the 1605 catechism refers to a \\"lost\\" translation of Ledesma's catechism, but that is likely a reference to linguistic disputes that led to rejection of Dauk≈°a's work and re-translation of the catechism in 1605. The hypothetical Lithuanian catechism of 1585 is not reliably attested in any contemporary sources such as personal correspondence, subsequent published works, or catalogs of old archives and libraries. Therefore, according to Sergejus Temƒçinas, the claim should be rejected and Dauk≈°a's catechism should be considered the first Lithuanian-language book printed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Content Dauk≈°a's catechism was a translation of the popular Roman Catholic catechism by , Spanish Jesuit, published in Rome in 1573. Dauk≈°a translated it from a Polish translation that in turn was a translation from Italian. The book has two parts with their own title pages and forewords: catechism (108 pages) and confessional (88 pages). The catechism, written in a question-and-answer format between a teacher and a student, has five parts on Christian faith, person's will, hope, love, and the seven sacraments. The confessional writes that a person needs to analyze and understand themselves and only then they can be Christians and go to confession. The book also includes two hymns ‚Äì translations of Adoro te devote by Thomas Aquinas in syllabic verse and Salve regina in free verse. These are quite poor translations and Dauk≈°a did not exhibit greater poetic skills. The book does not have any original texts, even forewords were translated, but Dauk≈°a did not blindly follow the Polish original and modified the text to better suit the needs of local Lithuanians. For example, the text about the First Commandment specifically referred to symbols of pagan Lithuanian mythology. In total, researchers identified about 10 larger text deletions and about 20 text additions. Language Ostensibly, the book was intended for the Diocese of Samogitia, but Dauk≈°a wanted to reach the widest audience. The Polish original is dedicated to children, while Dauk≈°a addressed his work to every Christian. In his task, Dauk≈°a was faced with the problem of different dialects of the Lithuanian language. To appease all dialects, he included many synonyms (lexical equivalents). For the clergy, who were often Polish and spoke little Lithuanian, he included equivalent loanwords in the margins. For example, next to Lithuanian pasaulis (world), he noted svietas from Polish ≈õwiat. Jonas Kruopas counted a total of 189 instances of synonyms written in the margins and 35 instances of synonyms in the same sentence in addition to numerous synonyms found in different places in the work. Overall, Dauk≈°a used far less loanwords than other early authors. Scholars believe that instead of using Slavic loanwords he invented several words, including abejojimas (doubt), ƒØkvƒópimas (inspiration), privalomas (obligatory), that became well accepted part of the standard Lithuanian. This lexical richness and diversity makes the text valuable for the research of the Lithuanian language. Despite Dauk≈°a's efforts, the translation was not well accepted by the contemporaries from the Diocese of Vilnius who complained that it was not written in \\"Lithuanian\\" (i.e. eastern Auk≈°taitian dialect) but in \\"Samogitian\\" (i.e. western Auk≈°taitian dialect). Dauk≈°a translated and submitted for publication two works: the catechism and the postil. Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis, patron of Dauk≈°a, lacked funds to publish both books ‚Äì the full cost of the publication had to be borne by the patron as it was forbidden to sell books published by the Jesuits. Therefore, Giedraitis proposed to Benedykt Woyna, administrator of the Diocese of Vilnius, to share the burden: Giedraitis would pay for the much more substantial and expensive postil while Woyna would pay for the catechism. Perhaps Dauk≈°a knew of this arrangement beforehand and made the efforts to include synonyms for all dialects. But the final product was not suited for the Diocese of Vilnius. Therefore, the catechism of Ledesma was re- translated by an anonymous author and re-published in Vilnius in 1605. This work is the first published work in the old eastern Auk≈°taitian dialect used around Vilnius. This dialect became extinct in the 17th century due to the pressure of Slavic languages. Publication history The catechism was not known for earlier authors on Dauk≈°a until a copy was found and republished by Eduards Volters in 1886. In 1929, published the catechism together with the Polish original and the anonymous re-translation of 1605. A new publication was prepared by Vida Jak≈°tienƒó and Jonas Palionis in 1995 (). It includes photocopied and transliterated catechism alongside with the Polish original.

In 1888, with Domenico Gnoli, he founded the journal, \\"Archivio storico d'arte\\" (after 1901 it was called \\"L'Arte\\"). He would remain editor of the publication up until 1940. From 1896 to 1931 he served as chair of medieval and modern art at the University of Rome.Venturi, Adolfo Dictionary of Art Historians In 1923, author John R. Eyre reported Venturi's opinion on the Isleworth Mona Lisa, which had become known to the public a decade earlier, and was proposed to be a work of Leonardo da Vinci. According to Eyre: Pursuant to museum director Corrado Ricci's claim that La Scapigliata had been forged by its former owner, Gaetano Callani,{{cite web title=Testa di fanciulla, detta ‚ÄúLa scapiliata‚Äù publisher=Galleria Nazionale di Parma location=Parma, Italy language=Italian url=https://complessopilotta.it/opera/testa-fanciulla/?portfolioCats=167 causing it to be re-attributed as \\"by the school of Leonardo\\", Venturi asserted that the work was by Leonardo, and revealed evidence that sought to link the work with the House of Gonzaga. In 1928, Venturi expressed doubt in a painting claimed to be Leonardo's Leda and the Swan which had been sold in an auction for $88,400.\\"Painting Sold for $88,400\\", The San Francisco Examiner (June 20, 1928), p. 9. It was reported that Venturi, \\"while admitting that the execution is very fine and that the picture resembles the lost original, nevertheless declared that the painting is too precious, too classical, too elegant to be entirely a product from the master's brush\\". Venturi's reputation as an art expert was called upon in 1929 in the Hahn vs. Duveen court case, a sensational trial that centered on the authenticity of a version of Leonardo da Vinci's La Belle Ferroni√®re. Venturi testified against the asserted authenticity, deeming the painting at issue to be a \\"low copy\\".

His father was the Treasurer (Khajanchi) of Bhopal and also involved in agriculture. Lalwani died on 4 January 2004 and was survived by his wife, Mohna, and children.  The Lalwani family  The main branch of the Lalwani Family are descendants of Rai Seth Poonamchand whose father Hiralal had migrated from Merta, Rajasthan, to Bhopal in the early 1800s. Poonamchand was a money-lender and traded in grains, and he laid the foundation of the family's future businesses. One of his two sons, Rai Seth Moolchand, was the father of Sardarmal.  Early life  Sardarmal Lalwani studied at the Christian College, Indore, affiliated to the Allahabad University.  Career  Lalwani brought the first colour-printing press, imported from Germany, to the state. He ran a printing business called Lalwani Litho and Typework Pvt. Ltd. from 1942 and the road on which the press was founded is now known as the Lalwani Press Road. In 1944, he also founded the Bhopal Construction Company Ltd, which was commissioned for numerous government and private works, including the laying of railway tracks. Lalwani cultivated the Sarbati wheat and was a pioneer in bringing mechanised agriculture to the state. He also worked as a grain merchant and had a flour mill. Other businesses included money-lending, rum bottling, and the import and trade of foreign goods. In addition, he founded India Film Corporation Ltd. and was the first film-maker from Bhopal. His productions included Nai Reet (1948), starring Geetabali, Sulochna and Rajindar.  Political career  Lalwani was a member of the first Legislative Assembly of the Jan Sangh from 1952 to 1957 in Madhya Bharat.

In 1975, Lalwani was president of the state unit of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and was targeted by the Government of India during The Emergency. This did not deter him from remaining a staunch RSS loyalist. He was a good friend of Shankar Dayal Sharma, the ninth President of India, and of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was the tenth Prime Minister of India. He was also closely associated with Prakash Chandra Sethi, Virendra Kumar Saklecha, and Sunderlal Patwa, all of whom were Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh.  Social outreach  Lalwani held many posts in public life. He was the President of the Rotary Club in 1945 and of the Lions Club. As Founder President of the Bal Niketan Orphanage, he established the roots of an organisation benefiting orphans and children of jail inmates. He was also the President of the Grain Merchants Association and the Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti, Chairman of Smt. Bishenjibai Kanstiya Trust, President Ratanbai Jain Mehnaut Trust, President, Bhopal Gaushala Association, President, Bhopal Tehwaar Sabha, and Founder President of Shri Jain Shwetamber Vidhya Mandir which runs a school in Lalwani Lane.

They can be grown by chemical vapour deposition (diameters of 30‚Äì250 nm).Gallium nitride makes for a new kind of nanotube. lbl.gov (2003-05-12). Retrieved on 2017-03-29. History Single crystal gallium nitride nanotubes were first reported to be synthesized by Peidong Yang and his research team at the University of Berkeley's Department of Chemistry on April 10, 2003. The synthesis was achieved by initially creating nanowires from pure crystals of zinc oxide onto a sapphire wafer through a process Yang and his colleagues previously created called epitaxial casting. These zinc oxide nanowires were then used as templates over which crystals of gallium nitride were grown by chemical vapour deposition. Once the gallium nitride crystals formed, heat was then applied to the sapphire wafer to allow vaporization of the zinc oxide nanowire cores. This left behind hollow gallium nitride nanotubes, since gallium nitride is a much more thermally stable material compared to zinc oxide. The resulting gallium nitride nanotubes were uniform in lengths of 2-5 Œºm and 30-200 nm in diameter. Structure and Properties of Gallium Nitride Nanotubes =General Shape and Size= GaNNTs are a form of one dimensional material analogous to the much more popularly known Carbon nanotubes. Experimental and theoretical analysis of GaNNTs have shown that these nanotubes can be constructed with a diameter of 30-250 nm and a wall thickness of 5-100 nm. The GaNNTs also differ by how the tubes are \\"rolled.\\" The rolls are categorized by how the molecular structure bends and use a (n, m) format to determine how the tube was bent into shape. The two most common formations are zig-zag, which has a (n, 0) bend, and armchair, which has a (n, n) bend. Both the size of the nanotubes and the rolling of the nanotube play a part in the properties of any given GaNNT. The structural properties of a GaNNT begin with the lattice constant, c, of the unit cell of a GaNNT. The lattice constant is dependent on the bond length of the atoms. For a zig-zag shape, c = 3 - (bond length), while for the armchair shape, c = - (bond length). A theoretical evaluation has determined that the optimum bond lengths are 1.92 angstroms and 1.88 angstroms for zig-zag and armchair nanotubes respectively. This tube geometry remains stable through a very wide temperature range, from just above 0K to 800K. =Band Structure= The band gap of GaNNTs depends on both the rolling and size of a particular nanotube. It was found that a zig-zag GaNNT would have a direct band gap, while an armchair GaNNT would have an indirect band gap. Additionally, the band gap increases with increasing radius. However, while for a zigzag GaNNT the band gap would increase significantly, an armchair GaNNT would have its band gap increase only slightly. A nitrogen vacancy in the structure, which while energetically unfavorable is more likely than a gallium vacancy, results in a band that is dependent on the spin states of the electrons. The band for spin down electrons creates an unfilled band above the Fermi level and increases the band gap, while the band for spin up electrons creates a filled band under the Fermi level and decreases the band gap. This spin-dependent band splitting makes GaNNTs a potential candidate for spintronic computing systems. =Mechanical= Mechanical properties of GaNNTs are influenced by the rolling of the nanotubes, though it is unclear if the size of the nanotubes plays a part as well. The Young's modulus was computed to be 793 GPa for a (5,5) armchair nanotube, while that for a (9,0) zig-zag nanotube was calculated to be 721 GPa. For the (5,5) armchair and (9,0) nanotubes, other calculated values include the maximum tensile strength was 4.25 and 3.43 eV/Angstrom, the critical strain was 14.6% and 13.3%, and the Poisson ratio was 0.263 and 0.221 respectively. It is assumed that the properties for any (n, m) nanotube in between would have a property somewhere in those ranges. The mechanical properties are also influenced by the temperature of the material and the strain rate the nanotube is put under. For temperature, the tensile strength of a GaNNT decreases at higher temperature. At higher temperatures, more molecules possess sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier which results in deformation at lower strains. The strain rate of the material causes there to be a reduced tensile strength when the strain rate is lower. This is due to the material not being under constant strain throughout, resulting in some locations in the material having higher stresses than other locations. The slower strain rate allows the GaNNT more time to induce adequate local deformations, and therefore plastic deformation occurs earlier. This means that a slower strain rate results in a lower tensile strength. Synthesis =Hexagonal Gallium Nitride Nanotubes (h-GaN)= Gallium nitride (GaN) nanotubes are primarily formed in one of two ways: using a template directed method or vapor- solid (VS) growth. Template Directed Method The template method uses a hexagonal zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire as the templates. Using chemical vapor deposition, thin layers of GaN are deposited onto the templates, creating a casting from epitaxial growth. The ZnO nanowire templates are then removed by thermal reduction and evaporation. An analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that ZnO residue, along with a thin film of porous GaN, is still found in the upper portion of the nanotubes after the templates are removed. This is a result of zinc and oxygen coming off of the template through the porous layer of GaN in the initial stages of forming the nanotube. This method produced h-GaN nanotubes that primarily had one open and one closed end, although tubes with both ends open were also found. Using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), it was observed that the nanotubes have a 1:1 ratio of intensity in gallium and nitrogen. The nanotubes had walls between 5- 50 nm thick, and inner diameters with lengths between 30- 200 nm. Vapor-Solid Growth GaN nanotubes can be made without a template. Another way to make h-GaN nanotubes is through a two- stage process that converts Gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) nanotubes to h- GaN nanotubes. This method produces less variation in the size and shape of the nanotubes produced. The nanotubes produced have a length of about 10 nm and a uniform outer diameter of around 80 nm and wall thickness of around 20 nm. This method yields 4- 5.0% products, which is based on how much Ga2O3 is present. =Cubic Gallium Nitride Nanotubes (c-GaN)= Using Ga2O3 powders and ammonia (NH3), c-GaN nanotubes can also be synthesized without the use of a template in a vapor- solid process. Instead, a catalyst- free high temperature process is used, which requires certain conditions. One of these conditions was high heat. The nanotube growth for c-GaN nanotubes was done at around 1600 degrees Celsius (200 degrees higher than the conditions required to grow h- GaN nanotubes), and was continuously increased throughout the process. Another condition required that the flow rates of NH3 and N2 be increased during the two- step chemical reaction required to make the nanotubes. The first step required carbon from a graphite crucible, which reacted with Ga2O3 to produce Ga2O vapor. The vapor then reacts with NH3 to produce solid GaN nanoparticles that are picked up in the NH3 and N2 flow. The nanoparticles are then transported to a lower temperature induction furnace where they will collect in groups on a carbon fiber and self- assemble rectangular nanotubes through vapor- solid growth. Most of the formed nanotubes have a square or rectangular cross section with lengths between 50- 150 nm. The tubes were found to have a wall thickness between 20- 50 nm and longer lengths of several micrometers. Before this method was applied, nanocrystallites of c-GaN were the only nanostructures able to be synthesized in the cubic structure of GaN. Recent Progress =Large Scale Fabrication= M. Jansen et al. has developed a low-cost, fast, and large scale fabrication process for the generation of gallium nitride nanotubes. This was achieved by using a combination of lithography and inductively coupled plasma top-down etching to produce a hard etch mask of a silicon nano ring array. The nano ring array was then placed onto the surface of bulk gallium nitride and etched away to produce nanotube structures of equal proportions. =Microchip Integration= Chu-Ho Lee and his research group at the Seoul National University in Korea were able to synthesize indium doped gallium nitride nanotubes that were fabricated onto silicon substrates. The group used these nanotubes as light emitting diodes, which primarily emitted light in the green visible spectrum. Since the synthesis of these nanotubes relies on controllable geometric parameters, gallium nitride nanotubes could potentially allow for ways to produce microchips with faster processing speeds through the use of interchip and intrachip optical communication. =Tube Shape and Emitted Light Shape= Changyi Li and his research team at the University of New Mexico recently showed that by changing the geometry of the openings on gallium nitride nanotubes, the shape of emitted light changes when acting as light-emitting diodes. The group used electron beam lithography to create well-defined annular shaped hollow regions within the gallium nitride nanotubes, which ultimately led to annular shaped emitted light.

The devices are real enough to be believable, yet surreal enough to raise your eyebrows.\\"Eddo- Lodge, Reni, \\"The Sellout by Paul Beatty review ‚Äì a whirlwind satire about racial identity\\", The Guardian, May 11, 2016. Beatty has indicated surprise that critics refer to the novel as a comic one, indicating his belief that discussing the comic aspects of the novel prevents critics from having to discuss its more serious themes. He has also stated that he does not think of himself as a satirist. Awards and honors2016 National Book Critics Circle Award (Fiction), winner. *2016 Man Booker Prize, winner.

They were one of the most popular local bands in the Rochester scene during the 1960s, scoring a regional hit with \\"The Hump\\" in 1965. History The band was formed by Herb Gross (aka Herb McGovern) in Rochester, New York in 1960. The initial lineup consisted of the leader Gross on guitar and vocals, Bruce Hickey on guitar, and Dave Hickey on drums. In 1961, while Gross was attending the Rochester Institute of Technology, he expanded the band to include Jim Kohler on bass and Mark Blumenfeld on lead guitar. The band renamed themselves the Invictas. The name was inspired by the Buick car of the time known as the Invicta, meaning \\"invincible\\" in Latin. The Invictas, who used a black hearse with their band logo painted on the side to haul equipment and travel from gig to gig, became a regular fixture at Tiny's Bengal Inn, a local club. The group attracted the attention of Steve Brodie's Sahara label. A USA Today article says that the band recorded their debut single, \\"The Hump\\", in 1963, but this time frame is unlikely, because, according to Markesich's book, it was not released until June 1965, which places the period of recording between late 1964 and mid-1965. \\"The Hump\\" b/w \\"Long Tall Shorty\\" was released on Sahara. Just before going into the studio to record the single, the band had to bail their keyboard player out of jail. The song received airplay on the East Coast and was a hit in western New York, reaching a #1 position in Rochester, leading the band to claim that they \\"outsold the Beatles\\" locally. In 1966, a year after the record's original release, \\"The Hump\\" became a huge hit, reaching #1 in Buffalo. The band's popularity exploded, and they opened for famous acts such as the Beach Boys, Jay and The Americans, the Shirelles, Gary Lewis and The Playboys, the Young Rascals, and Otis Redding. According to Gross, \\"Girls were chasing us. We could play pretty much wherever we wanted to play.\\" The Invictas recorded an album entitled The Invictas a Go-Go, which was produced by Dave Lucas and was hastily recorded during a weekend session in New York City in 1965. It consisted of several tunes written by Gross such as \\"Do It\\" and \\"The Hump,\\" as well as covers of popular songs like \\"Hang On Sloopy\\", \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" and \\"Satisfaction.\\" The group was not satisfied with the results, feeling that the project had been rushed. The band cut three more singles for Sahara Records and its sister label Bengal. In early 1966 the Invictas released \\"Do It\\" b/w \\"The Hook\\". They followed this with \\"I'm Alright\\" b/w \\"Stuff\\" later in the year. In 1967, they released \\"The Detroit Move\\", a blue-eyed soul number inspired by Detroit's Mitch Ryder, backed by \\"Shake a Tail Feather\\" on the B-side. Facing the prospect of the Vietnam draft after graduation, Jim Kohler joined the Air Force and Dave Hickey followed suit. The band continued with modified lineups for several more years, but with the constant grind of touring finally taking its toll, the band broke up in the early 1970s. Herb Gross started an advertising firm and has been active with it for many years. Jim Kohler became involved the printing business. The Invictas had a brief and temporary reunion in the 1980. In 2004, Herb Gross and Dave Hickey were watching a blues band perform in Rochester and the singer invited them onto the stage. When Gross came up to sing, to his surprise, the crowd pleaded for him to sing \\"The Hump.\\" Afterwards, he expressed to Hickey that the band should reunite. The band got back together with three of the four original lineup, Gross, Dave Hickey, and Jim Kohler, as well as also Dave Profeta, who is now the band's lead guitarist. Proefta also participated in their 1980 reunion. They have been active, playing various gigs and functions since, and have been profiled in USA Today and on NBC's The Today Show. They still travel in a hearse with their logo painted on the side. Their collected work from the 1960s is included on the anthology Best of Herb Gross & the Invictas: √Å Go Go, which includes their 1965 album √Å Go Go along with singles and outtakes. Since re- uniting they have released an album of newly recorded material, Let's Party.

(2011). On Generalized Fractional Integrals and Derivatives, Ph.D. Dissertation, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, August, 2011. The Katugampola fractional integral generalizes both the Riemann‚ÄìLiouville fractional integral and the Hadamard fractional integral into a single form and It is also closely related to the Erdelyi‚ÄìKober Fractional Integrals and Derivatives: Theory and Applications, by Samko, S.; Kilbas, A.A.; and Marichev, O.

Amsterdam, Netherlands, Elsevier, February 2006. operator that generalizes the Riemann‚ÄìLiouville fractional integral. Katugampola fractional derivative has been defined using the Katugampola fractional integral and as with any other fractional differential operator, it also extends the possibility of taking real number powers or complex number powers of the integral and differential operators.  Definitions  These operators have been defined on the following extended-Lebesgue space. Let \\\\textit{X}^p_c(a,b), \\\\; c\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\, 1 \\\\leq p \\\\leq \\\\infty be the space of those Lebesgue measurable functions f on [a, b] for which \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\textit{X}^p_c} < \\\\infty , where the norm is defined by :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\textit{X}^p_c} =\\\\Big(\\\\int^b_a t^c f(t)^p \\\\frac{dt}{t}\\\\Big)^{1/p} < \\\\infty, \\\\end{align} for 1 \\\\leq p < \\\\infty,\\\\, c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and for the case p=\\\\infty :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\textit{X}^\\\\infty_c} = \\\\text{ess sup}_{a \\\\leq t \\\\leq b} [t^cf(t)], \\\\quad ( c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}). \\\\end{align}  Katugampola fractional integral  It is defined via the following integrals {\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)} \\\\int^x_a \\\\frac{\\\\tau^{\\\\rho-1} f(\\\\tau) }{(x^\\\\rho - \\\\tau^\\\\rho)^{1-\\\\alpha}}\\\\, d\\\\tau, }} for x > a and \\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\alpha) > 0. This integral is called the left-sided fractional integral. Similarly, the right-sided fractional integral is defined by, {\\\\Gamma({\\\\alpha})} \\\\int^b_x \\\\frac{\\\\tau^{\\\\rho-1} f(\\\\tau) }{(\\\\tau^\\\\rho - x^\\\\rho)^{1-\\\\alpha}}\\\\, d\\\\tau. }} for \\\\textstyle x < b and \\\\textstyle\\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\alpha) > 0. These are the fractional generalizations of the n-fold left- and right-integrals of the form : \\\\int_a^x t_1^{\\\\rho-1} \\\\, dt_1 \\\\int_a^{t_1} t_2^{\\\\rho-1} \\\\,dt_2 \\\\cdots \\\\int_a^{t_{n -1}} t_n^{\\\\rho-1} f(t_n)\\\\,dt_n and : \\\\int_x^b t_1^{\\\\rho-1} \\\\,dt_1 \\\\int^b_{t_1} t_2^{\\\\rho-1} \\\\,dt_2 \\\\cdots \\\\int^b_{t_{n -1}} t_n^{\\\\rho-1} f(t_n) \\\\, dt_n for \\\\textstyle n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, respectively. Even though the integral operators in question are close resemblance of the famous Erd√©lyi‚ÄìKober operator, it is not possible to obtain the Hadamard fractional integrals as a direct consequence of the Erd√©lyi‚ÄìKober operators. Also, there is a corresponding fractional derivative, which generalizes the Riemann‚ÄìLiouville and the Hadamard fractional derivatives. As with the case of fractional integrals, the same is not true for the Erd√©lyi‚ÄìKober operator.  Katugampola fractional derivative  As with the case of other fractional derivatives, it is defined via the Katugampola fractional integral. Let \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C},\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\alpha) \\\\geq 0, n=[\\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\alpha)]+1 and \\\\rho >0. The generalized fractional derivatives, corresponding to the generalized fractional integrals () and () are defined, respectively, for 0 \\\\leq a < x < b \\\\leq \\\\infty , by The half- derivative of the function f(x) = x^{0.5} for the Katugampola fractional derivative. The half derivative of the function f(x) = x^ u for the Katugampola fractional derivative for \\\\alpha = 0.5 and \\\\rho = 2. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\big({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{D}^\\\\alpha_{a+}f\\\\big)(x)&= \\\\bigg(x^{1-\\\\rho} \\\\,\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\bigg)^n\\\\,\\\\, \\\\big({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^{n-\\\\alpha}_{a+}f\\\\big)(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{\\\\alpha-n+1 }}{\\\\Gamma({n-\\\\alpha})} \\\\, \\\\bigg(x^{1-\\\\rho} \\\\,\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\bigg)^n \\\\int^x_a \\\\frac{\\\\tau^{\\\\rho-1} f(\\\\tau) }{(x^\\\\rho - \\\\tau^\\\\rho)^{\\\\alpha-n+1}}\\\\, d\\\\tau, \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} \\\\big({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{D}^\\\\alpha_{b-}f\\\\big)(x) &= \\\\bigg(-x^{1-\\\\rho} \\\\,\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\bigg)^n\\\\,\\\\, \\\\big({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^{n-\\\\alpha}_{b-}f\\\\big)(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{\\\\alpha-n+1 }}{\\\\Gamma({n-\\\\alpha})}\\\\bigg(-x^{1-\\\\rho}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\bigg)^n \\\\int^b_x\\\\frac{\\\\tau^{\\\\rho-1} f(\\\\tau) }{(\\\\tau^\\\\rho - x^\\\\rho)^{\\\\alpha-n+1}}\\\\, d\\\\tau, \\\\end{align} respectively, if the integrals exist. These operators generalize the Riemann‚ÄìLiouville and Hadamard fractional derivatives into a single form, while the Erdelyi‚ÄìKober fractional is a generalization of the Riemann‚ÄìLiouville fractional derivative. When, b=\\\\infty , the fractional derivatives are referred to as Weyl-type derivatives. = Caputo‚ÄìKatugampola fractional derivative = There is a Caputo-type modification of the Katugampola derivative that is now known as the Caputo‚ÄìKatugampola fractional derivative. Let f \\\\in L^1[a, b], \\\\alpha \\\\in (0, 1] and \\\\rho . The C-K fractional derivative of order \\\\alpha of the function f:[a,b] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}, with respect to parameter \\\\rho can be expressed as : {}^C\\\\mathcal{D}^{\\\\alpha, \\\\rho}_{a+}f(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\rho^\\\\alpha t^{1-\\\\alpha}}{\\\\Gamma(1-\\\\alpha)}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\int^t_a\\\\frac{s^{\\\\rho-1}}{(t^\\\\rho-s^\\\\rho)^\\\\alpha}\\\\big[f(s)-f(a)\\\\big]\\\\,ds. It satisfies the following result. Assume that f \\\\in C^1[a, b] , then the C-K derivative has the following equivalent form :: {}^C\\\\mathcal{D}^{\\\\alpha, \\\\rho}_{a+}f(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\rho^\\\\alpha }{\\\\Gamma(1-\\\\alpha)}\\\\int^t_a \\\\frac{f^\\\\prime(s)}{(t^\\\\rho-s^\\\\rho)^\\\\alpha}ds. = Hilfer‚ÄìKatugampola fractional derivative = Another recent generalization is the Hilfer- Katugampola fractional derivative. Let order 0<\\\\alpha<1 and type 0\\\\leq{\\\\beta}\\\\leq{1}. The fractional derivative (left-sided/right-sided), with respect to x, with \\\\rho>0, is defined by :\\\\begin{align} ({^{\\\\rho}\\\\mathcal{D}^{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}_{a\\\\pm}}\\\\varphi)(x)&=\\\\left(\\\\pm\\\\,{^{\\\\rho}\\\\mathcal{J}_{a\\\\pm}^{\\\\beta(1-\\\\alpha)}}\\\\left(t^{\\\\rho-1}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\right){^{\\\\rho}\\\\mathcal{J}_{a\\\\pm}^{(1-\\\\beta)(1-\\\\alpha)}}\\\\varphi\\\\right)(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\left(\\\\pm\\\\,{^{\\\\rho}\\\\mathcal{J}_{a\\\\pm}^{\\\\beta(1-\\\\alpha)}}\\\\delta_{\\\\rho}\\\\,{^{\\\\rho}\\\\mathcal{J}_{a\\\\pm}^{(1-\\\\beta)(1-\\\\alpha)}}\\\\varphi\\\\right)(x), \\\\end{align} where \\\\delta_{\\\\rho}= t^{\\\\rho-1}\\\\frac{d}{dt}, for functions \\\\varphi in which the expression on the right hand side exists, where \\\\mathcal{J} is the generalized fractional integral given in ().  Mellin transform  As in the case of Laplace transforms, Mellin transforms will be used specially when solving differential equations. The Mellin transforms of the left-sided and right-sided versions of Katugampola Integral operators are given by = Theorem = Let \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C},\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\alpha) > 0, and \\\\rho >0. Then, :: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\bigg({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^\\\\alpha_{a+}f\\\\bigg)(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\big(1-\\\\frac{s}{\\\\rho}-\\\\alpha\\\\big)}{\\\\Gamma\\\\big(1-\\\\frac{s}{\\\\rho}\\\\big)\\\\,\\\\rho^\\\\alpha}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{M}f(s + \\\\alpha\\\\rho), \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Re}(s/\\\\rho + \\\\alpha) < 1, \\\\, x > a, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\bigg({}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^\\\\alpha_{b-}f\\\\bigg)(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\big(\\\\frac{s}{\\\\rho}\\\\big)}{\\\\Gamma\\\\big(\\\\frac{s}{\\\\rho} + \\\\alpha\\\\big)\\\\,\\\\rho^\\\\alpha}\\\\, \\\\mathcal{M}f(s + \\\\alpha\\\\rho), \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Re}(s/\\\\rho) > 0, \\\\, x < b, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} for f \\\\in \\\\textit{X}^1_{s + \\\\alpha\\\\rho}(\\\\mathbb{R^+}), if \\\\mathcal{M}f(s + \\\\alpha\\\\rho) exists for s\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}. Hermite-Hadamard type inequalities Katugampola operators satisfy the following Hermite-Hadamard type inequalities: = Theorem = Let \\\\alpha > 0 and \\\\rho >0.. If f is a convex function on [a, b] , then :: f\\\\left(\\\\frac{a+b}{2}\\\\right) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\rho^\\\\alpha\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +1)}{4(b^\\\\alpha -a^\\\\alpha)^\\\\alpha}\\\\left[{}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^\\\\alpha_{a+}F(b)+{}^\\\\rho \\\\mathcal{I}^\\\\alpha_{b-}F(a)\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2}, where F(x) = f(x) + f(a+b-x), \\\\; x \\\\in [a, b]. . When \\\\rho \\\\rightarrow 0^+ , in the above result, the following Hadamard type inequality holds: =Corollary= Let \\\\alpha > 0 . If f is a convex function on [a, b] , then :: f\\\\left(\\\\frac{a+b}{2}\\\\right) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha +1)}{4\\\\left(\\\\ln \\\\frac{b}{a}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha}\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\alpha_{a+}F(b)+ \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\alpha_{b-}F(a)\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\frac{f(a)+f(b)}{2}, where \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\alpha_{a+} and \\\\mathbf{I}^\\\\alpha_{b-} are left- and right-sided Hadamard fractional integrals.

As player, committeeman, under-19s coach, selector and President of the Past Players group he was deeply involved with such a wide range of club activities that it is hard to think of anyone with a matching diversity of roles in the club‚Äôs history. The former Malvern Grammar boy began his involvement with the Saints as a 17 year old in the 1954 season. He would play for our under-19s on a Saturday, and front up again the next day for Balaclava in the Sunday competition. In later years Brian would muse about how fit he and his mates must have been to play back-to back games every weekend. His first coach in the thirds at St Kilda was Hughie Thomas, by then in his 60s and a famed figure who had been Jock McHale‚Äôs assistant at Collingwood in the Magpies‚Äô greatest era before coaching St Kilda‚Äôs reserves and seniors in the 1940s. In 1955 Brian was Best and Fairest for the Under-19s, and was runner-up in the competition best and fairest ‚Äì the Morrish Medal. He lost by just two votes and if not for broken fingers keeping him sidelined for six games he would have, in all likelihood, won the award. Brian made his senior debut in 1956 in an atmosphere of wholesale huge change at the club under new coach Alan Killigrew. Brian would later write: ‚ÄúHe started recruiting young blokes and getting rid of a few he didn‚Äôt think were up to it. He created a magnificent feel about the place and you wanted to train because you could see there was something there for the future.‚Äù He had 15 senior games in that first year and ended with 42 to his name. His greatest asset was his superb high marking , but he was the first to admit that his awkward kicking style didn‚Äôt always produce the best results. He didn‚Äôt play a senior game in 1960 and his good friend and teammate Allan Jeans took over as reserves coach for the latter part of the season. A picture of the reserves team taken before the final round at Fitzroy shows the two men seated next to each other, and it is likely that Brian was skipper of the twos that day in what proved to be his last game in the Saints colours. For Jeans there was a new appointment in the offing and he took over the senior coaching role a few weeks later. Jeans always put the club first and Brian recalled their conversation after a training session. ‚ÄúJeansy said one night he wanted to drive me home. I knew what was going to happen. He said I think you should go make a quid from a coaching job. I said that‚Äôs fine. He was good about it- he was a mate of mine‚Äù. That mateship extended across decades and the pair enjoyed many great times together on the rinks at Cheltenham Bowls Club. Muir captain-coached East Brighton for two years in which the Vampires made the preliminary final both times. More importantly from a Saints perspective he nurtured kids like Carl Ditterich, Jeff Moran, Dennis Bartley and Jim Read and gave them their entry to senior suburban footy. Read and Moran were wingers in the 1966 premiership, and Ditterich famously missed that game through suspension. An East Brighton team picture from 1962 includes the young Ditterich and Bartley in Muir‚Äôs team. His time at East Brighton came to an end because of his increasing workload as a wool classer. He would eventually become manager of Dalgety‚Äôs Melbourne enterprise and was widely respected across north-east Victoria and Gippsland. In 1963 he returned to the Saints when elected to the committee and a few years later when a vacancy came up as Saints‚Äô under-19 coach, fellow committeeman Brian Gleeson pointed at him and said ‚Äúwe have a ready-made coach sitting over there!‚Äù Along the way Brian had also been a senior selector for the club. He thoroughly enjoyed his seven years coaching the Under-19s and was delighted to see youngsters like Russell Greene, Grant Thomas, Bill Mildenhall and Colin Carter all go on to substantial senior careers. Brian Muir‚Äôs energies were also put int the creation of the club‚Äôs Junior Development programme. He had already made a telling contribution to the club across a wide spectrum, but he then entered upon another phase with the past players group. Working with Brian Milnes he resurrected this vital part of the club and subsequently became president of the past players for 14 years. It is fair to say that if not for Brian Muir‚Äôs efforts we would not have such a strong past players group today. ‚ÄúMoo‚Äù as he was universally known, summed up his time with the Saints succinctly in his contribution to the Saints‚Äô 1966 Icon Archive: ‚ÄúI have loved every minute of it.‚Äù See also Australian football at the 1956 Summer Olympics  Notes   External links  * Category:Living people Category:1936 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:St Kilda Football Club players ","title":"Brian Muir (footballer)"},{"id":"48977576","text":"Frank Hanrahan (born 20 January 1938) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

She was one of the first fine artists to move to quilting as a medium of choice in the late 1950s. Her quilts followed neither traditional method nor pattern; they were bold, modern, colorful collages, often laced with humor and satire. Penning over twenty books and teaching over 2,000 workshops, Laury helped women see the creative possibilities in everyday objects and awake their sense of inspiration. Laury has been called a \\"foremother of a quilt revival\\", and \\"one of the pioneers\\" of non-traditional quilts. Early life and education Born on March 22, 1928 in Doon, Iowa, Jean Ray Laury was the daughter of Ralph and Alice Ray. She was the second of four girls. Growing up, Laury's \\"mother encouraged her to 'do what you want to do, and don't do what everybody else does.'\\" As a child, Laury loved drawing and painting. The family moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee where she graduated from high school. She returned to Iowa to attend Iowa State Teachers' College (now University of Northern Iowa), where she earned her bachelor's degree in Art and English in 1950. After teaching art for several years, she moved to California. She went on to marry Frank Laury, who worked as a professor at California State University, Fresno, in 1952. Beginning a master's program in Design at Stanford University, Laury became intrigued by the art of quilting. Laury gravitated towards quilting because it gave her the flexibility work at home and allowed her to start and stop as needed to take care of her home and children. While Laury grew up in a small community where quilting was common, she had paid little attention to quiltmaking until now. Always one to take on a challenge, Laury began experimenting with the craft. One aspect that Laury was adamant about was that she did not want to work with a pattern. Inspired by her son Tom, Laury's first quilt was an appliqu√© quilt called Tom's Quilt. It was filled with images familiar to children, but Laury interpreted them in a simplified contemporary style. Incorporating this quilt into her final master's degree project, Laury graduated in 1956. 'Tom's Quilt' was included in a student exhibition at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco, and led to a solo exhibition there several years later. Laury entered her first quilt in the 1958 Eastern States Exposition in Storrowton Village in West Springfield, Massachusetts. Although it did not win any prizes, it attracted the attention of Roxa Wright, one of the jurors and creative editor at House Beautiful magazine. Through her, Laury got commissions to design quilts for magazine projects. Later, Laury followed her to Woman's Day. Jean's designs were included in Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, Cosmopolitan, Needle and Craft, and many other publications. Finding inspiration in everyday objects, Laury's mission was \\"to blur the lines between fine art (painting and sculpture) and decorative art (fiber, wood, glass, ceramic).\\" While she experimented with various mediums, Laury honed in on quiltmaking by the 1970s. In 88 Leaders in the Quilt World Today, Laury stated, \\"I like making quilts that grow out of everyday life, so politics, women's issues, major earthly shake-ups and humor are always part of my work. This personal involvement is what draws me to quiltmaking and keeps the field vital.\\" Influence within art quilt movement Laury's keen eye for art and design allowed her to see past the functional benefits of a quilt. In Ho For California!, Laury speaks to the qualities that early quilts possess beyond warmth: > Quilts, however, satisfied another need as great as that of physical warmth: > the need to feel connected to family and to other generations, the need for > continuity. Quilts offered a way of maintaining ties at a time when > photographs were uncommon (or unknown), and the arrival of letters by mail > could take months. Quilts constituted contact ... Quilts become archetypal > symbols of the women who make them. They 'stand in' for the quilter, long > after she is gone, revealing to descendants, viewers, or new owners the > essence of the quilter ‚Äì her spirit, energy, vitality, and skill. Laury believed that \\"a great quilt exists when it relies on ... the principles of art that make any piece of visual work look great ... I don't see a big difference between fabric on the wall and paint on the wall.\\" Laury stated that \\"art has less to do with the material used than with the perceptive and expressive abilities of the individual. Any difference between the 'fine' and the 'decorative' arts is not a matter of material, but rather what the artist brings to the material. Any media may successfully be used at any level for any purpose.\\" Just like with \\"traditional\\" art, what is viewed as great to one person will not necessarily be viewed as great by another. Everyone has personal experiences that affect their reaction and relationship with a work of art. Laury's quilt aesthetic is far from traditional. Taking an innovative and contemporary approach, Laury's quilts are filled with humor, wit, and contradictory images; \\"a world in which cartoon-like irons fly through the air emitting innocent puffs of steam, absurdly happy housewives pursue their drudgery in a dreamy state of bliss, and politicians are hoisted on their own petards.\\" While Laury's quilts may be politically charged and confrontational, that is far from her personal demeanor. Laury relied on her quilts to showcase her stance on important issues since she struggled \\"to argue politics or feminism or anything else loudly and strongly in a group.\\" The comic strip format is one that Laury continually gravitated towards. Laury utilized this format because \\"[n]obody turns away from comic strip format; everybody feels 'I can get this.' So they'll read what I have to say, and I can comment on things that I think are important to me or important to people in general.\\" Laury preferred to use natural fabrics like cotton and has experimented with numerous effects including printing and stamping to achieve her desired end- appearance Her one stipulation was that the fabric remain soft and quilt-like. Overall, Laury is known as the pioneer \\"of silk-screened images on quilts.\\" Using an unconventional strategy for an artist, Laury chose not to be represented by a gallery or dealer. Because of this, Laury did not sell many of the pieces she exhibited; instead, she preferred to commission pieces with architects. While Laury's work has received much praise and recognition from the art world, she has not always felt confident about her work. In 2000, Laury stated, \\"I've always kind of had the impression that maybe my quilts were never going to be appropriate for a museum ... Now I've changed my mind somewhat, maybe museums are more open to quiltmaking.\\" One of Laury's most well-known quilts is titled 'Barefoot and Pregnant', completed in 1985. It was selected as one of America's 100 best quilts of the twentieth century during the Ultimate Quilt Search by panelists representing the Alliance for American Quilts, The American Quilt Study Group, the International Quilt Association, and the National Quilting Association. Jean Ray Laury took the soft art of quilting with \\"Barefoot and Pregnant\\" and used the best of the political/social cartoon tradition to deliver a hard message. A remark by a state politician of the time, quoted in a newspaper, inspired the artist to respond in a manner that expressed her indignation in a humorous, constructive way. Jean combines images and words to allow the viewer to be able to laugh at the absurdity of the statement. It is part of the permanent collection of the International Quilt Study Center & Museum at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln. 'These is Not Art,' created in 1984, is another quilt in which Laury used humor to continue the debate, \\"What is art?\\" Silk screened around the border of the quilt is a quote she saw in the guestbook of an exhibition of contemporary paintings. \\"These is not art to me all these squares and things ... real art has ‚Äì you know ‚Äì like a Madonna in it ...\\" Her quilt is filled with little multicolored squares and things that are not static but dance around the surface. Laury was less concerned about the 'art' part of art quilts than she was about its message. Laury was a prolific quilter. The International Quilt Study Center & Museum at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln has 41 of her quilts in its collection, the largest public collection of quilts in the world. Michael James stated that \\"Jean Ray Laury was an artist, writer, poet, designer, teacher, mentor, and inspiration to countless numbers of quiltmakers and fabric artists over the last 50 years.\\" Part of Laury's career involved completing commissions which included \\"panels and murals for the United California Bank and Del Web Hotel, both in Fresno, Harrah's Clubs in Tahoe and Reno, and the Nut Tree (a restaurant/mixed use development) in California.\\" These \\"public installations helped establish fiber arts as a legitimate pursuit in California.\\" Empowering women and community involvement With encouragement from Roxa Wright, Laury began work on her first book, Appliqu√© Stitchery, published in 1966.[7] The book \\"covered techniques and ideas not covered elsewhere.\\" Laury's second book, Quilts and Coverlets: A Contemporary Approach was published in 1970. These first two books \\"framed needlework as a conscious effort against standardization.\\" In her books, Laury emphasized the ability as well as the need of women to individualize their homes and make them less a product of mass production. Laury did not stray from the traditional ideal of family with \\"bread-winner father, stay-at-home wife, and kids who were the woman's responsibility to raise.\\" During the 1960s this arrangement was still the norm, and these women were Laury's primary audience for books, magazine articles and designs. By identifying herself as an average mother and housewife, Laury offered her own path to creativity and art making as a model for other women to follow. During the emergence of the art quilt movement, Laury sensed that she could use this art form to fuel the feminist art movement as well. Laury soon realized that networking was going to be the key to the successful growth and evolution of these movements. In Quiltmaking in America, Laury states: > That contact marked, for me, the beginning of networking‚Äîthe opportunity to > exchange with another quilter information of mutual interest. It offered > access to information not available through known sources, and included > observations, opinions, and intuitive responses that criss-crossed with > one's own. It continued the tradition of sharing among quilters. As a lecturer, Laury presented programs at colleges, universities, symposiums and conferences across the country (including Quilt National) as well as to guilds of quilters, embroiderers, designers, and weavers. She taught at California State University-Fresno, for UC Davis Extension, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.[24] In 1976 Laury was a presenter at the first event \\"which can be considered, in retrospect, as a national quilt conference held in Ithaca NY in conjunction with the Finger Lakes Bicentennial Quilt Exhibit\\". In 1977 Laury was the guest lecturer at the Lincoln Quilt Symposium in Nebraska. On that indication there were 600 participants from 40 states. Laury travelled during the 1970s, 1980s and well into the 1990s. She began teaching extensively in Canada and Europe (Belgium, France, Norway and Austria). Eventually, Laury expanded her teaching into South Africa, Australia, and Japan. As Laury stated \\" no matter where I was, when we talked about quilting, we talked about women's lives. Women's issues were universal.\\" The support Laury found while at conferences and symposia was incomparable to any she experience she had had before. Not only did she find confidantes and co-workers, but she also found lasting friends. The leaders within the art quilt movement were not selfish. They not only wanted this new art form to grow and flourish, but they also wanted to share their findings and learn new techniques with one another. They understood the value and importance of community building. Because of this, Laury and Joyce Aiken decided to hold a week-long Quilt Camp in Shaver Lake, California in 1973. Laury's \\"Quilt Camp\\" brochure stated the workshops were about fiber arts, but became support groups and consciousness raising groups. Even though two men applied, she chose to limit enrollment to women. She felt that \\"the all female environment encouraged sharing, as many women were hesitant or reluctant to express themselves openly and would defer to men when they were present\\". The pair decided to make this an annual event, and Aiken continued to help until 1998. Laury's \\"daughter Lizbeth and friend Susan Macy\\" stepped in and helped until the last camp was held in 2002. Overall, Laury was known as an instigator. She helped women realize that they could be creative without sacrificing their responsibilities at home. \\"She encouraged women to mine their worlds for inspiration by introducing them to the extremely fertile interior landscape of their own imaginations ... She suggested treating chores as a time to think.\\" She wanted to help women uncover creative avenues in their everyday lives that they never knew existed. She also \\"encouraged women to get out and attend exhibitions, to look at work they likes, but more importantly, to spend time in front of the work they didn't like.\\" This exercise would help them form their own opinions and begin to build their own signature aesthetic. In addition to focusing on networking and community building opportunities, Laury was involved in countless other aspects of the art quilt movement. She was a writer for Quilters Newsletter during the 80s and 90s, curated exhibits including the Bushveldt To Kop: Quilts of South Africa at the Fresno Art Museum in 1993, and \\"donated her personal papers on children's books to the Arne Nixon Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Henry Madden Library California State University, Fresno.\\" With her vast accomplishments and involvements, Laury has been recognized as one of the most pivotal members of the development art quilt movement. Influential writer Laury started by \\"writing a diary in elementary school and, in one form or another, continued writing her entire life. She kept quiltmaking journals and daily diaries, wrote dozens of poems and short stories, and especially enjoyed corresponding with other quiltmakers.\\" Laury stated \\"[p]utting thoughts and ideas into words give them importance and validity.\\" Laury's writing style was conversational and usually tinged with humor. Like her teaching methods, her books and articles describe more than techniques. She intertwined \\"how to\\" instruction with philosophy, encouraged her readers to be original, value their work, explore and take creative risks. Her approach inspired many readers, including young artists who embraced the quilt as their primary means of expression as well as others who wanted to incorporate creativity into their everyday lives. One of Laury's most significant books was The Creative Women's Getting-It-All- Together at Home Handbook written in 1977. In a review of this book by Bonnie Lehman in Quilter's Newsletter Magazine, Lehman wrote \\"It is a marvelous book. I wept over it and I laughed over it, and think anyone, male or female who has ever tried to do work at home will not be able to get through it without a tear or a smile.\\" In the same article, in a review by Beth Gutcheon, Gutcheon also related a story about a woman who was asked if the book changed her life and she answered \\"Yes. It did.\\" Gutcheon states \\"I couldn't have put it better myself\\". Another notable book that Laury was involved in writing was Ho For California! Pioneer Women and Their Quilts. In her preface, Laury states \\"Quilts become archetypal symbols of the women who made them. They \\"stand in\\" for the quilter, long after she is gone, revealing to descendants, viewers, or new owners the essence of the quilter ‚Äì her spirit, energy, vitality, and skill.\\" Laury wrote extensively for Quilter's Newsletter Magazine with a series of essays titled \\"Keeping it All Together\\" beginning in May 1982 through March 1984; these essays were reprinted in book form in 1983. Her series of essays, \\"Talking it Over,\\" began in April 1984 and ran through December 1990. Laury also wrote children's books and poetry, including No Dragons on My Quilt (1990) and her notable \\"Sunbonnet Sue\\" series. During her career Laury wrote/co-authored 25 books. In an interview conducted for the \\"Quilters Save Our Stories Project\\" established by the Alliance for American Quilts, Laury stated \\"I probably like writing as much as anything. I love writing.\\" Death While Laury was recognized internationally as a pioneer of the art quilt movement, her life mission was simply to inspire others to see the greatness and artistic abilities within themselves. \\"She encouraged all quiltmakers to apply art principles: pattern, color, texture, rhythm, line; to quilts, and to incorporate painting, printmaking and photographic techniques in their work.\\" Her commitment to teaching, hosting seminars and workshops, and writing, allowed her to impact the lives of thousands of women. By infusing her lectures and workshops with \\"anecdotes from her own life's balancing act, juggling deadlines and dirty dishes, parenting and artistic problem solving,\\" Laury was able to connect with her audience on a personal level. Most importantly, Laury emphasized the significance of courage, \\"the courage we all need to know ourselves, to understand and pursue our own dreams, to face our challenges and our fears, and, in the end, to the courage it takes to grow old.\\" Laury's commitment to quiltmaking paved the way for future generations of studio art quilters.

The line-up includes Carl W. Jackson on Guitar and lead vocals, Alistair Elkins on bass guitar, Lachlan Jackson on Guitar and Leigh Thompson on drums. Brothers Carl & Lachlan Jackson formed the band (with Lachlan on bass) with their neighbour Brendan Lichtendonk on drums in 1998 whilst living in Launceston, Tasmania. Carl & Lachlan relocated the band to Melbourne in 2001 and Leigh Thompson joined on drums. They were one of Australia's \\"buzz\\" punk/pop acts and were the first band signed to Boomtown Records in 2002. Wishful Thinking's musical style was pop punk and followed in the style of bands such as Blink 182 and New Found Glory. History In the year 2000 Wishful Thinking were signed to local independent record label Spoon Records and toured Australia with US band All Star United. Shortly after they played mainstage at Australia's Sonfest in Victoria and QLD. It was at this festival that Carl and Lachlan met Leigh Thompson who would later join the band on drums. Wishful then went on to support Millencolin and Area 7 at the Metro in Melbourne. Lachlan left the band at the end of 2001 and Carlos Echeverria joined shortly after on Bass Guitar. Carl, Leigh and Carlos recorded Wishful Thinkings first Album Standing Still' in 2002 which would go on to be the first record released by Boomtown Records. Wishful Thinking received rotation on the radio stations Triple M and Triple J, with their single \\"I Don't Need You\\" which was released in 2003. Carlos left the band in early 2004 and Alistair Elkins Joined on Bass guitar. Carl, Leigh and Alistair recorded the Album Kicking Goal, Banging Gongs & High Fives All Round and embarked on a national tour with Label-Mates Sounds Like Chicken that included shows in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. and their 2004 single \\"The Day You Went Away\\" was also featured on Triple J. During their 13-year hiatus the band reformed for a once-off show in August 2009 at the Adelaide Uni Bar with S.T.R. Wishful Thinking also have shared stages and toured with bands such as MXPX, The Getaway Plan, In Fiction, Angelas Dish, Kisschasy, Rufio, Gyroscope, Relient K, The O.C. Supertones, the Porkers, Mach Pelican and Antiskeptic. Critical reception Tim Cashmere of Undercover News reviewed their debut album, Standing Still (2003); he described them as a \\"Christian-punk act\\" and felt the album was \\"none-too-shabby, albeit none-too-original either... The god-fearing punk beats of Wishful Thinking makes an interesting point of difference.\\" Ben Seifu of vibewire.net noticed that \\"the production is quite professional without being too smooth or processed. The drums in particular are captured reasonably well. But beyond that Standing Still is pretty standard pop punk stuff.\\" Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project opined that it \\"oozes of punk pop goodness that echoes heroes of said genre such as MXPX. The band's strength lies in their combination of consistent punk power chords with a lyrical depth underpinning their spiritual beliefs.\\" Steph Brincat of Oz Music Project reviewed the group's second album, Kicking Goals, Banging Gongs & High Five All Round, rating it at four out of five due to the \\"classic pop-punk sound that we have all come to know and love, without making it sound horrible and generic, and I assure you that I am not being sarcastic or ironic. The music is tight and although it doesn‚Äôt stray from the usual pop-punk recipe of repetitive yet catchy bass, guitar and drum explosion, there is variation in their tunes such as interesting little guitar licks and bass solos.\\" Reunion and Reformation In December 2018 Wishful Thinking were featured on Radio Station Triple J's Short, Fast, Loud program of Great Australian Bands that had broken Up.

Usage history According to some sources Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iranian Revolution, first used the term in its contemporary meaning. Israel was condemned as the \\"Little Satan\\" in 1979 by Khomeini when he was addressing Israel's backing of the Shah, its close ties to the US, and the ongoing Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. According to other sources, such as the Glasgow Herald, Colonel Gaddafi of Libya stated that \\"Israel is the little Satan\\" in July 1980. Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, used this phrase when referring to Iranian rhetoric during a visit to the United States stating that: \\"For the Mullahs that rule Tehran, Israel is the small Satan and America is the great Satan.\\" Contemporary use The term is often used by Islamist terrorists to recruit terrorists and by Shia speakers to propagate hatred towards Israel. The term also features heavily in contemporary Iranian propaganda. In Fatima gate border, a Lebanese gate border near Israel, two pillars have been erected for people to perform a symbolic stoning of little Satan (Israel) and great Satan (the United States). It is hoped that Lebanese people will perform this act instead of throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah, which has the same political ideology as Iran, also refers to Israel as the Zionist entity and as little Satan.

Location  ≈öniadecki Street is oriented east‚Äìwest and provides a link between Gda≈Ñska Street, Bydgoszcz in the east and Dworcowa Street in Bydgoszcz to the west. It crosses an important city plaza, Piastowski Square (). The presence of the Brda hotel practically closes the western tip of ≈öniadeckich Street to traffic with a final very narrow section.  Naming  Through history, this street had the following names: * Until 1920, Elisabethstra√üe; * 1920‚Äì1939, Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki; * 1939‚Äì1945, Dr Goebbels Stra√üe; * since 1945, Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki. Current patrons of the street are brothers ≈öniadecki: Jan an astronomer, and Jƒôdrzej a doctor, biologist and chemist. They were born in ≈ªnin and both taught as professors at Stefan Batory University of Vilnius in the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century.  History  The street in 1905 The street was defined in the mid-19th century. As a consequence of the set up in 1851, of the railway station () in the north-west of Bydgoszcz, an intensive urban development happened in order to connect this area with the historical heart of the city, Gda≈Ñska Street. It is the same process that led to the development of nearby Dworcowa Street. At that time, the street was named Elisabethstra√üe, along with Elisabethmarkt (now Piastkowski Plac) the plaza it crossed to the north, in honor of Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, wife of the reigning the King of Prussia Frederick William IV of Prussia. Elisabethstra√üe on an 1876 map On this axis have been erected also religious edifices, such as in 1910-1913 the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on Elisabethmarkt, or the Church of the Resurrection in Elisabethstra√üe. The importance of this avenue slowly decreased with the growing role that took Dworcowa Street, parallel to the south, but broader and larger, which had been used since 1888 by a newly built streetcar.

It is one the first realization of J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki together with his stepfather, Anton Hoffman, a master bricklayer. Recently renovated, the elevation boasts neo- Renaissance forms inspired by the Italian Cinquecento: bossages and simplicity of motifs renders perfectly the symmetry of this house. In the corner giving onto both streets, a remarkable bay window on two levels, flanked at each floor by lean columns emphasizes this portion of the facade. In his next realizations, J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki will elaborate further on his architectural style, adding more details and features, like building at Tenement at Freedom Square 1 (1896) or at 1/3 Stary Port (1893-1905).

The building strikes by its original shape and its rich architectural decoration. The facade is asymmetrical, the only bay window is unbalanced, with quarter circle wrought- iron balconies flanking its left side. Both balconies have a bear cub holding a shield that stands in the corner: it is a reminder of the past activity of a metal craftwork company in the district. A elaborate frieze runs between first and second level, and two windows are topped with triangular pediments: the one on the right side is adorned with a bas-relief of bearded male head with a hat. On the top of the facade stands a sundial, neighboured by two finials. At street level, one can notice the grand portal, crowned by a mask of a beast.

In Bromberg's time, address was Elisabethstra√üe 25: owners were registered as \\"Ms Sendler and Genossen\\". In 1915, an architect, Walter Findeisen, lived in this house. The building housed till 2019 the Honorary Consul of the Federal Republic of Germany in Bydgoszcz, when it moved to 19 Dworcowa Street. The tenement stands out of the local urban environment with its lean and high features. Due to its late inception (1910s), the building has been erected according to late Art Nouveau canons, thus it catches the eye among late 19th century edifices. The house architecture is underlined on the one hand by long vertical lines without any ornament (art), broken up on the first floor by horizontal bossages, and on the other hand by two massive bay windows and a modest bartizan. Building's elevation has been refurbished in 2015‚Äì2016.

It is sequel to 2007 film Aap Kaa Surroor. The film was a joint production of T-Series and HR Musik Limited. The film stars Himesh Reshammiya and Farah Karimae in the lead roles. Naseeruddin Shah, Shekhar Kapur, Kabir Bedi, and Monica Dogra play the supporting roles. Teraa Surroor was released on 11 March 2016 in over 1000 cinemas all over India. The basic plot was taken from the Hollywood film The Next Three Days. Plot The film begins with the murder of two Indian origin men in Ireland being killed by a masked man. The story then shifts to Tara Wadia, who is a singer and the girlfriend of a businessman-cum-gangster Raghu and lives with her mother. Raghu, it is revealed, is much in the eyes of the law. One day, Raghu confesses to Tara that he had spent a night with a prostitute unintentionally. Disappointed, Tara breaks up with him and decides to leave for Ireland, despite her mother trying to convince her of Raghu's goodwill. However, the moment she lands in Dublin, she gets detained after being caught with drugs. Tara calls Raghu for help. Now he must help her and find Anirudh Brahman, the stranger who befriended Tara on Facebook and invited her to Ireland. Raghu hires a lawyer, Elle Jordan to rescue Tara and tries to get her bailed out but the plea is rejected by the judiciary. Fearing a supposedly insurmountable life sentence, Raghu decides to help Tara, during which time, it is revealed that in childhood, he used to work for a gangster, Aurangzeb, who was badly wanted by the law, simply because Aurangzeb had held his mother a slave and she was in need of an operation, for which Raghu wanted money. A man named Anthony, instead, promised to give money for his mother's operation, and Raghu was trained in using a pistol to shoot Aurangzeb. When he proceeded with the task, he initially hesitated to shoot the gangster, but when Aurangzeb insulted his mother, Raghu shot him multiple times without a second thought. Raghu consults with Robin Dharamraj Santino, an infamous convict who has escaped 14 times from prison. Robin says that he would charge him 20 mins each to help him and Raghu agrees. Robin briefs him all plans and procedures and warns him that he must get Tara out of jail just within 20 minutes before the entire city would lock down by an automatic system. Succeeding in helping Tara escape, Raghu stays back for fighting the cops to buy her time. After a successful escape, Raghu reconciles with Tara after revealing to her that his act of sleeping with the prostitute was actually part of a plan, and that he is actually an undercover assassin who has previously killed many criminals on behalf of Commissioner Afzal A. Khan. Seconds later, he is informed of Anirudh Brahman's location, and upon reaching there, is shocked to find Haider, Tara's close friend and associate, who confesses that he wanted to trap Raghu out of revenge for having killed Aurangzeb, who, it turns out, was his father. Raghu kills him and reunites with Tara.

Early life and education Ante Bakotiƒá was born in Sinj on 14 June 1921 as the fourth child in the family of six. He attended primary school in his native Sinj, where he also enrolled in the high school that he for unknown reasons stopped and began to study the carpenter trade. Due to poor working conditions and mistreatment by his masters, Bakotiƒá left the apprenticeship and enrolled in Military- technical school in Kru≈°evac from which he eventually graduated. After graduation, he went to Sarajevo and started working in the defense industry. He joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1939. Participation in World War II During 1941-45, World War II Bakotiƒá fought as a member of the Yugoslav Partisans. In the spring of 1942 Bakotiƒá and a group of partisans were caught by enemies in the Neretva valley, and were deported to Jasenovac concentration camp. Until the end of September 1944, there was a secret Communist Party organization of the Jasenovac concentration Camp no. 3 Brickyard, led by the People's Hero of Yugoslavia ; this secret conclave had been working on preparations for the camp detainees breakthrough. The work of the organization was compromised on 21 September 1944, which led to the brutal murder of almost all of its members. Bakotiƒá eventually restarted the plan, this time as Secretary. The organisation operated in secret on the plan for the breakthrough. Its work culminated in the spring of 1945. Breakthrough The male camp detainees attempted their breakthrough and breakout on 22 April 1945, just before the end of the war. The building in the women's camp had housed 760 women until the evening before when the women were marched to their deaths. The number of male detainees, on the night of the 21-22 April, was 1,073. That night they decided to breakthrough on the morning on 22 April around 10 am. Bakotiƒá played a prominent role in the breakthrough by shouting \\"Forward, comrades!\\", which marked the beginning of the breakthrough. Bakotiƒá did not survive. He was killed near the eastern gate of the camp. He was 23 years old.

Following frontier changes when he was 3, he grew up not in Sweden, but in Prussia.Some sources identify him simply as Daniel M√ºller while others resequence his names, most commonly to Daniel Andreas Joachim M√ºller. Life Daniel Moller was born in Stralsund, at that time still in Swedish Pomerania. His grandfather had come, originally as a soldier, from Scania, the southern tip of mainland Sweden. The Stralsund region had become Swedish during the course of the Thirty Years' War, following a military siege in 1628; but in 1815, under terms mandated at the Congress of Vienna, the whole of Pommerania was returned to Prussia: Daniel's father, a successful commercial/market gardener, changed the family name from \\"Moller\\" to \\"M√ºller\\". Daniel M√ºller left the local Gymnasium (secondary school) when he was 17, and embarked on an apprenticeship in his father's business. Between 1836 and 1838 he attended lectures by Christian Friedrich Hornschuch at nearby Greifswald University. Here he became friendly with the horticulturalist Ferdinand J√ºhlke. In the University Botanical Gardens he undertook a second apprenticeship after which Hornschuch transferred responsibility for organizing the gardening work to him. In 1839 he was able to switch to Uppsala where on the recommendation of Hornschuch he took over responsibility for the Botanical Gardens, thereby becoming an indirect successor of the celebrated botanist Linnaeus. M√ºller was peculiarly suitable for the Uppsala position not merely on account of his expertise as a gardener, but also because his upbringing had left him fluent in both German and Swedish. In the years that followed he was able to act as a link between horticultural research in the two language zones, publishing numerous scientific papers in both languages. Before leaving for Uppsala Daniel M√ºller had married Clarissa Luise Nernst (1808‚Äì1878), the daughter of Joh Christopher Nernst, a teacher from R√ºgen. The two of them led a fulfilled family life, taking on responsibility for three foster children. However, there were personnel problems at the Uppsala Botanical Gardens, where he felt he was underpaid, and after a couple of years M√ºller handed in his notice, and in 1841 moved to Stockholm, taking a position with the recently established Swedish Horticultural Society (Svenska tr√§dg√•rdsf√∂reningen). Here he taught at the new Gardening Academy, and worked at the Society's gardens. He was given responsibility for plant research and exhibitions. He also planned the greenhouses. It was a measure of his success that from 1844 the Horticultural Society received state support. At a time of rapid change in the world of horticulture, M√ºller also continued his own education with study trips to Germany and Denmark. In 1846, funded by the king, he visited Saint Petersburg, at that time a world-class center of advances in horticulture. On the recommendation of Ferdinand J√ºhlke, in 1848 he became an honorary member of the \\"Horticultural Development Association for New Western Pomerania and R√ºgen.\\" In the same year he was involved in the establishment of the \\"Stockholm Gardens Association\\", becoming its first chairman. It was also in 1848 that his three volume work \\"Tr√§dg√•rdssk√∂tsel\\" (\\"The art of gardening\\") appeared. This work reappeared in successive editions even after his own death, and was the most influential Swedish gardening book of the period. At the same time, his work at the Swedish Horticultural Association was becoming increasingly burdensome This problem was exacerbated, according to one source, by a disinclination to delegate hands-on work to colleagues. Towards the end of the 1840s he resigned from his position with the Association. In 1849 he opened the \\"Charlottenburgs handelstr√§dg√•rd\\", Sweden's first commercial nursery, on the island of Reimersholme in central Stockholm. In 1851 Elias Magnus Fries at last took over the teaching professorship for Botany at Uppsala University, appointed the same year as director in charge of the Botanical Gardens. Fries gained the promotion because of the death of the previous incumbent, G√∂ran Wahlenberg, who seems to have been involved in the personnel problems that had induced M√ºller to relocate to Stockholm in 1841. With Wahlenberg gone, M√ºller now returned to Uppsala and resumed his earlier responsibilities at the Uppsala Botanical Gardens. He increased the number of distinct plant types from 8,000 to 9,000 or 10,000, (sources differ), chiefly through exchanges with other Botanical Gardens. He also took up a request from the \\"Economic Society\\", and arranged for a two hectare site to the south of the Botanical Gardens to be planted with fruiting and ornamental trees. For this he was awarded the \\"Gold Medal of the Economic Society\\". The tree garden was uses as a training facility for trainee teachers. In 1856 M√ºller also drew up the plans for a Botanical Gardens in Visby. In 1854 M√ºller undertook a sea voyage in order to cure a chest illness. He died in 1857, as did most of his colleagues at Uppsala, during a cholera epidemic. His grave stone, financed by friends and former pupils, can still (2015) be seen in the city's old cemetery. In 1874 friends founded the \\"Daniel M√ºller stipendiefond\\", a travel bursary fund administered by the Stockholm Gardeners' Society. The writer Daniel M√ºller began to write poetry and to exchange ideas with others, similarly inclined, when he was a still a child. He also saw his horticultural activities as an opportunity to make the world a better place. In 1844 he published, together with his wife Clarissa Luise Nernst, a volume of poetry intended for friends and acquaintances. In 1855, following the dearth of her mother, the poet Thekla Kn√∂s (1815‚Äì1888) moved in with the M√ºllers. Together with the writer Fredrika Bremer, the M√ºller household took to attending the lectures presented by Elias Fries, and with the women Daniel M√ºller now published a volume of poetry, \\"Fyrv√§plingen ‚Äì vers och prosa\\" (\\"Four-leaf clover ‚Äì verse and prose\\"). A second volume, \\"Konvaljerna ‚Äì en sago-krans\\" (\\"Lilly of the valley ‚Äì a fairy ring\\"), followed. M√ºller's own contributions focused on just a few themes. They tell of his love for his wife and the vitality of the plant world, along with the more melancholy themes of a lost homeland, death and eternity. M√ºller lived before Evolution had been written up and become mainstream among scientists, and his own thoughts concentrate on the \\"moral\\" causes and outcomes in a natural world able to operate without human involvement. In nature and the world of plants he saw an unfolding of God's plan, in which man should participate as a \\"cultivator\\". From this perspective he also engaged in the debate of the time about introducing horticulture as a subject worthy of academic study. For him, horticulture offered the possibility of introducing \\"moral\\" context to rural populations, and he broadened this into a more general belief that becoming involved in cultivating \\"beautiful plants\\" even offered a way to curb alcoholism.

It rises around 13 kilometres south-southwest of the centre of Hanover in the borough of Springe and municipality of Wennigsen, whose boundary runs over the northwestern flank of the hill. The village of L√ºdersen which belongs to Springe lies on the Wolfsberg, the parish to the west belongs to Holtensen.  Geology and conservation  The Wolfsberg was formed in the Jurassic period. On its eastern side there are sandstone quarries with beds of Deister sandstone, which were exhausted in the 19th century. Since 1968 the Wolfsberg has been on the far side of the limit of building for protected area H-22 in the Hanover Region (this is currently being reviewed. According to political decisions the Wolfsberg element of LSG H-23 is to become part of North Deister).

It is an erect shrub whose leaves have 2 or 3 prominent teeth near their ends, and white or cream-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila compressa is an erect, open shrub which usually grows to between high with branches that are glabrous but have many warty lumps and are sticky towards their ends due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and point upwards so that they often obscure the branches. They are green, often with a purple tinge, elliptic to egg-shaped, mostly long, wide, and have 2 or 3 prominent teeth near their ends. The flowers appear singly or in pairs in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 narrow triangular, glabrous green sepals, long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to cream-coloured, glabrous on the outside but the inside of the tube is filled with long soft hairs and the top of the bottom lobe is also hairy. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs mostly from July to December and is followed by fruits which are oval-shaped, glabrous and about long.E. compressa habit on disturbed roadside Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1986 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock north of Salmon Gums. The specific epithet (compressa) is a Latin word meaning \\"compressed\\" referring to the compressed shape of the fruits. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs between Ravensthorpe, Grasspatch and Norseman in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions where it usually grows in disturbed clay or sandy loam soils. Conservation status Eremophila compressa is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture In cultivation this eremophila grows to high and almost as wide. It flowers over a long period and its open, spindly growth form is a feature. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum species, grows in most soils in full sun or partial shade, is frost tolerant and reasonably drought resistant.

Middlebrooks, born 3 August 1931, was a native of Jonesboro, Georgia, had studied mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech and had worked for aerospace contractor Martin-Marietta on the propulsion system for the Pershing missile program. The company specialized in products built around very compact low cost gas turbines built for high power output during brief periods. The turbine was fuelled by an isopropyl nitrate monopropellant that they sold under the brand name \\"Thermolene\\". In addition to the fuel, the main products sold by the company were: * Micro turbine engines, ranging from the \\"S-2\\" up to the \\"S-28\\", weighing only . * \\"AP\\", for Auxiliary Power, a piston engine supplemental supercharger driven by its own micro-turbine which could be engaged by a switch. The device was heavily based on Middlebrook's patent . Unlike conventional superchargers and turbos, no engine power would be used to supply the extra air, and testing on a Chevy 409 engine was reported to give a power gain from to with the supercharger engaged. * Conventional exhaust driven turbochargers. * \\"TB-28\\", the \\"drag axle\\", a micro-turbine to be mounted directly to the rear axle of a vehicle. It would supplement the power of the conventional engine, usually driving the axle via a Borg Warner sprag clutch, and was intended for drag racing. The price for a complete unit was . Power output was stated as up to , and it was essentially a on/off device. * Rocket thrust engines, in various sizes. The \\"T-16\\" had of thrust. One application was for drag racing gokarts, posting times of 7.3 seconds and speeds over for the quarter mile using a twin T-16 engine rocket powered kart driven by \\"Captain\\" Jack McClure. There were also higher powered models, like the T-21, T-22 and T-32. They were used to power cars, motorcycles (Evel Knievel planned to use one for a jump over Grand Canyon) as well as boats and more. The company was mostly based on mail order, and was a frequent advertiser in magazines, using gramophone records and 8mm film in addition to a catalog as promotional material. A 1955 VW Beetle named the \\"Black Widow\\", clocking 9.36 seconds quarter miles equipped with a Turbonique drag axle at the Tampa Dragstrip in 1965, occurred frequently in advertisements. When it crashed, becoming airborne after reaching , this event was also advertised, saying \\"we forgot our strength for a split second\\". Being based on rocket fuel and technology, there were a number of safety issues with these devices. For instance if the operator let off the throttle, then reapplied it, the device would essentially become a bomb. In 1967, after a few reported incidents and fatalities, the NHRA banned the use of Turbonique turbines for drag racing. In 1968, Middlebrooks was accused and jailed for mail fraud mostly based on the goods supplied by Turbonique being more difficult and more expensive to finish and install than described in the advertisements. At the trial, Middlebrooks waived counsel and represented himself. An appeal in 1972, stating that he suffered from hypomania at the time, was rejected. The company folded shortly after the court case. Middlebrooks died on 4 August 2005.

In 1904, the sixteen-year-old Cohon immigrated to the United States, He then chose a rabbinic career and began attending Hebrew Union College while studying concurrently for an A.B. in the University of Cincinnati. In HUC, he was a co-founder of the Ivriah Society, a club where several students and professors met to discuss matters of Hebrew culture and conversed only in that language. It was linked with the Cincinnati chapter of Poale Zion, serving as a small Zionist hub within the largely non-or-anti Zionist atmosphere.Edward K. Kaplan, Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940-1972, Yale University Press, 2007. p. 28. Cohon was ordained and joined the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1912, being naturalized during the same year. On 12 June he married Irma Reinhart. His first post was in Congregation Oheb Zedakiah at Springfield, Ohio. In 1913 he transferred to Zion Congregation, Chicago, which he headed for six years. From 1919 to 1923 he served in the city's Temple Mizaph, which he founded himself. From 1920 he was also the director of the Chicago Jewish Normal School. He also opened a small seminary which soon developed into the Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership.Kerry M. Olitzky, Reform Judaism in America: A Biographical Dictionary and Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, 1993. pp. 32-33.John Arthur Garraty, American National Biography, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 180. =Chair= In 1923, Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler retired from the presidency of Hebrew Union College. Kohler, a native of F√ºrth, symbolized the older generation of Reform rabbis who championed the rationalistic and ritually minimalist \\"Classical\\" era, embodied in the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform. A new strata of Eastern Europeans, who had more sympathy toward traditional mores, was rising through the ranks, like Solomon Freehof and Emanuel Gamoran. Cohon, prominent among them, was called to replace the departed president in the office of HUC Chair of Theology. At the time, most students paid little heed to the subject. Cohon believed that the Classicists overemphasized morals and ethics, ignoring the important functions of ceremonial acts, practical observance and Jewish particularism, expressed in such elements as Hebrew prayer. He was deeply influenced by Ahad Ha'am and Mordecai Kaplan, who espoused basically Judaism as a Civilization and not a religious belief, though he never accepted it as such. He was one of the first to criticize the latter for reducing the role of faith to little more than an appendage to culture and folkways. Cohon, while agreeing that ethnic solidarity, a sense of continuing tradition and communal life were a major factor in Judaism, never renounced the doctrines of a personal God, divine revelation and the Election of Israel, as did Kaplan. He worked to introduce his philosophy into the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, where \\"Classical Reform\\", strongly identified with native Jews whose forebears arrived from Central Europe in the 1840s and 1850s, was losing ground to new immigrants from Russia and Poland. Already in 1923, he was responsible for authoring the Revised Union Haggadah, where he inserted more Hebrew and traditional texts in an early manifestation of his ideas. He also pioneered interest in Jewish mysticism, offering a course in Hasidism which was sparsely attended.Michael Meyer, Samuel S. Cohon: Reformer of Reform Judaism, Judaism 15 (1966), pp. 319-28. In the strictly theological sense, Cohon did not diverge much from Kohler, who based his own conception on that of Rabbi Abraham Geiger. Cohon maintained belief in an ongoing revelation of God's will, much en sync with the progress of human consciousness, reflected but not identical with scripture and the conventions of Judaism in the past. He offered a slight modification in the notion of Election, that was rejected by many contemporary thinkers, describing Israel as \\"God-choosing\\", though he stressed this was merely a semantic matter. As \\"God-choosing\\", the people accepted their universal mission to spread knowledge of Him among the nations, another precept he took whole from \\"Classical\\" theology. Cohon also basically affirmed the Immortality of the Soul, another idea that was not without opposition from some quarters, as a tendency for pure humanism was spreading among Reform clergy.Arnold M. Eisen, The Chosen People in America: A Study in Jewish Religious Ideology, Indiana University Press (1983), . pp. 63-65. His convictions were of key importance as the movement shed Classicism in favour of a heightened sense of Jewish particularism and communality, laying the foundation for \\"New Reform Judaism\\". Cohon was chiefly interested in restoring a greater role to the collective over the personal sovereignty of the individual, a hallowed tenet of Reform. In 1931, Cohon published What We Jews Believe, a short primer aimed at initiating unlearned people at the basics of Judaism, in which he also conceitedly expressed his views. =Columbus 1937= The decade saw the Great Depression, as many communities were short of collapse, the rise of antisemitism in Europe and an influx of immigrants' sons into UAHC, who were befuddled by Reform's advocacy of strict personal autonomy and sought a more coherent and concrete expression of religiosity. At the CCAR convention of 1935, it was recognized that most rabbis shared at least some of his sentiments, and it was obvious that the 1885 principles of Pittsburgh had little appeal. President Felix A. Levy formed a commission to compose a new platform, headed by the Rabbi Samuel Schulman. His draft was laden with statements largely based on \\"Classical\\" precepts, eliciting protests from other members of the CCAR. Schulman's style was highly intellectual and equivocal, in line with the Classical negation of any set dogma. Cohon opposed a definitive dogmatic approach as well, and rejected Levy's tentative proposal to author a comprehensive religious manual for daily practice, but he did espouse a concise and clear document that would give congregants something tangible to uphold. Himself a member of the commission, he announced that he would form his own version and present it later. In the 1936 convention, his propositions also encountered resistance. In 1937, Schulman attempted to recruit more supporters, but later resorted to opposing any binding new platform. The CCAR was split even between his and Cohon's motions, with exactly eighty-one in favour of each. Levy intervened and cast the deciding ballot for Cohon, turning the tide. In the concluding vote, the platform was adopted with only eight against.Michael A. Meyer, Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism, Wayne State University Press, 1995. pp. 315-319. The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism, as the Columbus document was named, reflected its author's perception. It opened not with matters of belief, but with the declaration that \\"Judaism is the historical religious experience of the Jewish People\\". At the article titled \\"Religious Practice\\", he continued \\"it calls for faithful participation in the life of the Jewish community as it finds expression in home, synagogue and school... As a way of life requires in addition to its moral and spiritual demands... The retention and development of such customs, symbols and ceremonies as possess inspirational value, the cultivation of distinctive forms of religious art and music and the use of Hebrew.\\" It also expressed clear support for Zionism: \\"In the rehabilitation of Palestine, we behold the promise of renewed life for many of our brethren. We affirm the obligation of all Jewry to aid in its upbuilding as a Jewish homeland.\\" In 1940, Cohon participated in the liturgy committee entrusted with the revision of the Union Prayer Book, including much more Hebrew and traditional formulae. In 1948, he published his seminal Judaism: A Way of Life. He lectured at many institutions and wrote many other monographs and articles. In 1956 he retired from his post as Chair of Theology but remained a research fellow, dying at Los Angeles three years later. He and Irma had one son, Baruch Joseph Cohon.

It was published twice a month between 1916 and 1922 by Seyyed Hasan Taghizade (1878‚Äì1970), who also wrote articles for the journal Ayandeh from 1925 - 1928, and Seyyed Mohammad Ali Jamalzade (1892‚Äì1997). The title refers to an Iranian mythical hero: Kaveh, a smith from Isfahan.cf. Epkenhans, Tim (2000): Die iranische Moderne im Exil. Bibliographie der Zeitschrift KƒÅve, Klaus Schwarz Verlag:Berlin. The process of publication is divided into an old issue, a new issue and the final special issue. The old issue (1916‚Äì1919) consists of four year's issues with 35 numbers, six of them a double number.cf. Kaveh, 1916-1919. It was mainly an instrument of propaganda for the German Reich‚Äôs policy towards the East. After the end of the war and the dissolution of the NfdO, the German Orient Institute (DOI) and the Federal Foreign Office decided on continuing the financing of the periodical. The new issue (1920‚Äì1922) is divided into 25 numbers with a double number, although the first year's issue was ‚Äì in continuation of the old issue ‚Äì incorrectly labeled as year's issue five instead of year's issue one. As to content, it predominantly addressed literary and scientific topics. By 1922, Kaveh was not funded anymore and thus discontinued.cf. Epkenhans, Tim (2000): Die iranische Moderne im Exil.

Her father was noted botanist, Thomas Andrew Knight, who encouraged her education and included her in his experiments. She married an older land owner and, as they had no children, when he died she pursued her own interests, which included archaeology and architecture. She excavated a Roman villa, built a number of buildings and saved others in need of repair. She was keen on painting buildings and eventually went on to publish a charitable book The Castles & Old Mansions of Shropshire. Early life Acton Scott Hall, where Frances Stackhouse Acton spent the majority of her life Stackhouse Acton was born Frances Knight, better known as Fanny, on 7 July 1794 in Elton Hall near Elton, Herefordshire. Her parents were Thomas Andrew Knight, a noted botanist, and his wife Frances Knight, whose family owned the Elton estate. She was the eldest daughter of the family, with two sisters, Elizabeth and Charlotte Knight, along with a brother, Thomas. Around 1808, her family moved to Downton Castle in Herefordshire, which had been built by her great-grandfather, Richard and was owned by her uncle Richard Payne Knight. Her father strongly encouraged her and her siblings' education, and she is quoted as remembering \\"the hours spent with him in his study, or in his garden, as amongst the happiest recollections\\". In January 1812 when she was 18, she married the 43-year-old Thomas Pendarves Stackhouse in Old Downton Church in Downton. The couple moved into Acton Scott Hall, which was owned by Stackhouse's mother, though it was in a poor condition.\\"The small paned leaded windows with no shutters let in wind and rain so that the candles blew out unless protected by a screen. The drawing room carpet was often soaked with the rain that beat in during the night. In winter the only habitable room was the Smoking Room\\" - Frances Stackhouse Acton describing the Acton Scott Hall. Thomas Stackhouse inherited Acton Scott Hall from his mother when she died in 1834, and the couple became Mr. and Mrs. Stackhouse Acton. Her husband died the following year and as the couple had no children, Stackhouse Acton inherited his estate. Interests Frances Stackhouse Acton's husband died when she was just 40 years old. She had no children, and was free to follow her interests. These included diverse memberships in societies, such as archery or anti-vivisection or making donations of Silurian rocks to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. =Botany= Stackhouse Acton was encouraged into botany by her father, who included her in his horticultural experiments in the grounds Downton Castle. She illustrated two of her fathers publications including three illustrations in Pomona Herefordiensis and, seventy years later, jointly contributed to apple drawings in Herefordshire Pomona. She was regarded to be an \\"accomplished botanist and botanical artist\\", who influenced her cousins Emily and Charlotte to paint botanical subjects. =Archaeology= A Roman villa was discovered in the grounds of Acton Scott Hall. In 1844, Stackhouse Acton excavated the villa, along with numerous other Roman remains, writing about the project in detail to the Dean of Hereford. The building appeared to be a 31 metres long and 12.5 metres wide aisled barn which was converted into a house, including rooms heated by a hypocaust, probably a bath house. Stackhouse Acton drew up plans of the villa which included details of the hypocaust heating system. Later, she went on to reconstruct part the villa's hypocaust system in a nearby quarry. A 2009 investigation found evidence of the villa, but not in the precise location that Stackhouse Acton had described. =Buildings= Stackhouse Acton's primary interest lay in buildings. She would frequently paint historical buildings such as abbeys and stately homes, often leaving the people or animals in the image unfinished. She repaired a significant number of cottages on her estate and built a school. She also created a secret garden in the quarry where she had built the hypocaust system. Near to the secret garden, she built a Swiss-style chalet. Stackhouse Acton also spent some time updating Acton Scott Hall, replacing and extending windows, as well as bringing in some 17th-century woodwork. She took a particular interest in Stokesay Castle, which had fallen into disrepair by the first half of the 19th century. In 1853 she convinced the owner, William Craven, to pay to restore it under her supervision. The cost was over ¬£100 (worth approximately ¬£70,980 in 2015).Comparing average earnings on a project between 1853 and 2015, ¬£100 is valued at approximately ¬£70,980 by MeasuringWorth.com Although she managed to \\"clear out and secure\\" the castle, she did not succeed in countering the dilapidation and eventually the castle was sold. =Writings= When her father died, his family had many requests to publish his complete works. Stackhouse Acton compiled a collection of his papers and wrote a short biography in \\"Sketch of his life\\" in the introduction. Stackhouse Acton also authored a reference work, The Castles & Old Mansions of Shropshire, with the proceeds being donated to the Royal Salop Infirmary and the Eye and Ear Dispensary. The book went on to be regarded as \\"very valuable\\" to the Shropshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. Legacy Frances Stackhouse Acton died on 24 January 1881 in Acton Scott at the age of 86.

First mentioned in the 8th century, it gained strategic importance with the opening of the Gotthard Pass in the 13th century and was a founding member of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the late medieval period. Prehistory Lake Lucerne with Canton Uri at the southernmost point in the lake The oldest traces of humans in the Canton of Uri are from around 2200 BC and include a quartz production site and flint arrowheads at Hospental-Rossplatten and Gotthardm√§tteli. There are Bronze Age graves at B√ºrglen and possibly also some at Jagdmatt that are from 1300‚Äì900 BC. The earliest traces of a settlement were discovered at Amsteg and date from the Middle Bronze Age (1450‚Äì1200 BC). This village was located in a protected valley along a route into the Reuss and was near quartz, copper and iron deposits. An Iron Age village was built in the same spot around 500‚Äì450 BC. Pottery from the Bronze and Iron Ages show that these villages traded with surrounding villages and even crossed the alpine passes to trade with Quinto in Ticino and the alpine Rhine valley. The large Celtic treasure trove at Erstfeld, now generally interpreted as a votive offering to a mountain deity, indicates that there was a large, prosperous population in central alps during the 4th century BC. Early history During the Roman era, Uri remained mostly isolated from the Roman Empire. An analysis of the place names along the shores of Lake Lucerne show a Gallo-Roman influence, while in the mountain valleys Raetian names are more common. When the Roman Empire withdrew from the Alps, the lake side villages looked north to the towns along the lake for support, while the alpine villages in the valley called Urseren banded together. During the 7th century, Alemannic German speaking settlers from the Kingdom of the Franks began to move into the narrow plains around the southern end of Lake Lucerne. In a process that took about three centuries they spread into the alpine valleys. The number of place names with either German or Latin roots next to each other indicates that this migration was generally peaceful. The Alemanni grave at the church of St. Martin in Altdorf (660‚Äì680) shows the political and religious leadership roll that the Alemanni had in the upper Reuss valley. Uri is first mentioned in 732 as the place of banishment of Eto, the abbot of Reichenau, by the duke of Alamannia. In 853 it was given to the nunnery at Z√ºrich by Louis the German, which he had founded for his daughter Hildegard. It is unclear whether the gift included the entire Reuss valley or just certain settlements. The abbess appointed a vogt to manage the lands, but ruled the lands with a light hand. Many of the surrounding villages became tenants of the abbey or obtained similar privileges. Under the abbess, the villages of the valley began to develop a sort of local government. In contrast, the Urseren remained more isolated, though they had some connections to the Leventina valley. Some of the villages in the Urseren were settled by Disentis Abbey and were part of the Diocese of Chur. By the 10th century, there were settlements of Romansh speakers from Disentis in the high valleys. Between approximately 920 and 976 the Duke of Swabia was the vogt under the abbess in Zurich. They were followed by the Lenzburgs from 976 to 1173 and then the Z√§hringens. In 1218, the Z√§hringens died out, and the bailiwick was given to the Habsburgs. According to Aegidius Tschudi's history, in 1231 King Henry of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, bought Uri from the Habsburgs and granted it imperial immediacy. During the 13th century, the St. Gotthard Pass opened, which brought ever increasing trade and wealth to Uri. With the growing wealth, the towns and villages along the Gotthard route became increasing independent. As early as 1243 Uri had a district seal, and in 1274, Rudolph of Habsburg, who was now the Holy Roman Emperor, confirmed its historic privileges. In Urseren, Disentis Abbey appointed a vogt, though in 1239‚Äì40 Emperor Frederick II changed the vogt's office into a secular, imperial office. He appointed Count Rudolf of Rapperswil as his vogt. When the Rapperswil male line died out in 1283 the vogt office in Urseren also fell to the Habsburgs. Old Swiss Confederacy =Formation of the Confederacy= Tell Monument in Altdorf Battle of Morgarten A treaty of mutual recognition and assistance with Schwyz, possibly concluded in 1291 and certainly by 1309, would come to be regarded as the foundational act of the Old Swiss Confederacy or Eidgenossenschaft. The Battle of Morgarten in 1315, while of limited strategic importance, was the first instance of the Confererates defeating the Habsburgs in the field. A few months after the victory at Morgarten, the three Forest Cantons met at Brunnen to reaffirm their alliance in the Pact of Brunnen. Over the following decades, the Confederacy expanded into the Acht Orte, now representing a regional power with the potential to challenge Habsburg hegemony. The Confederacy decisively defeated Habsburg in the Battle of Sempach 1386, opening the way to further territorial expansion. In the traditional history of the Eternal Alliance, the Habsburgs had appointed a tyrannical vogt named Albrecht Gessler to rule over Uri from his castle in Altdorf. According to Tschudi's version of the events (recorded in the 16th century) Gessler raised a pole in the village's central square, hung his hat on top of it, and demanded that all the townsfolk bow before the hat. On 18 November 1307, William Tell visited Altdorf with his young son and passed by Gessler's hat, publicly refusing to bow to it, and so was arrested. Gessler ‚Äì intrigued by Tell's famed marksmanship, yet resentful of his defiance ‚Äì devised a cruel punishment: Tell and his son would be executed, but he could redeem his life by shooting an apple off the head of his son, Walter, in a single attempt. Tell split the apple with a bolt from his crossbow. However, Gessler noticed that Tell had drawn two bolts and discovered that Tell had planned to kill him if the first bolt had killed Tell's son. Gessler took Tell captive, but Tell was able to escape. Tell then ran cross-country to K√ºssnacht where he assassinated Gessler with the second crossbow bolt. Tell's assassination sparked a rebellion, which led to the R√ºtlischwur, a further alliance between Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. While the historicity of William Tell and specific events are questioned by modern historians, the cantons around Lake Lucerne and other nearby lakes had a long history of alliances. For example, in 1291, Uri, Schwyz and Z√ºrich entered into a three-year defensive alliance. In 1309, Emperor Henry VII combined Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden into the Waldst√§tte or Forest Cantons. In 1314, Duke Louis IV of Bavaria (who would become Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor) and Frederick the Handsome, a Habsburg prince, each claimed the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor. The Confederates supported Louis IV because they feared the Habsburgs would annex their countries as Habsburg property ‚Äî as they already had tried to do in the late 13th century. Districts of Ticino, showing the Leventina, Blenio, Bellinzona and Riviera districts War broke out over a dispute between the Confederates of Schwyz and the Habsburg-protected monastery of Einsiedeln regarding some pastures, and eventually the Confederates of Schwyz conducted a raid on the monastery. The Habsburg response to the raid, led to the Battle of Morgarten in 1315 where the Confederate army, including some troops from Uri, destroyed the Habsburg army. A few months after the victory at Morgarten, the three Forest Cantons met at Brunnen to reaffirm their alliance in the Pact of Brunnen. In the following forty years, the alliance expanded as other cantons (Lucerne in 1332 and Z√ºrich in 1351, Glarus and Zug in 1352 and Bern in 1353) joined the alliance.Christophe Guillaume Koch, Johann Daniel Sander, Gem√§hlde der Revolutionen in Europa: seit dem Umsturze des R√∂mischen Kaiserthums im Occident, bis auf unsere Zeiten, Volume 2, Sander, 1807, p. 47.J.

Following the victory at Sempach, Uri began a program of territorial expansion to allow them to control the entire Gotthard route. As a first step, Uri annexed the lands of Urseren in 1410. The Urseren was allowed to retain its own mayor and assembly, and its own courts under those of Uri. It was not fully incorporated till 1888. In 1403, with the help of Obwalden, it won the Leventina valley from the duke of Milan, but lost it in 1422. Though in 1440 Uri alone reconquered it and kept it until 1798. Between 1410 and 1418, Uri occupied the Val d' Ossola in Italy. In 1419, with Obwalden, Uri conquered Bellinzona, but lost it at the Battle of Arbedo in 1422. In 1478, Uri marched into the Leventina valley, south of the Gotthard pass. The citizens of the valley welcomed Uri's troops as liberators from the Duke of Milan. They then attempted to besiege Bellinzona, but gave up after 14 days, when the Duke sent 10,000 troops to drive them out. About 600 men of the Confederate rear guard defeated the Milanese army at the Battle of Giornico and drove Milan out of the Leventina valley but did not take Bellinzona. In 1500, with Schwyz and Nidwalden, it captured Bellinzona again and held it until 1798. By 1503, Uri, Nidwalden and Schwyz jointly controlled the bailiwicks of Blenio, Bellinzona and Riviera. In 1512 Uri shared in the conquest of Lugano with the rest of the Confederation. Together with the rest of the Confederation, Uri shared in the conquest and rule over a number of subject territories under the administration of several cantons including; 1415‚Äì1712 Baden, 1460‚Äì1798 Thurgau, 1482‚Äì1798 Sargans, 1491‚Äì1798 Rheintal, 1512‚Äì1798 Locarno, the Maggia valley, Lugano and Mendrisio and 1532‚Äì1712 the Freiamt including the Upper Freiamt between 1712‚Äì98. =Reformation and early modern era= The second battle of Kappel allowed Uri to choose to remain Roman Catholic, but allowed religious freedom in Switzerland The region resisted the Protestant Reformation and remained Roman Catholic. In 1524‚Äì25 the Landammann Beroldingen of Josue asked the cantonal scribe Valentin Compar to write a polemic against the reformer Huldrych Zwingli, which was read to the cantonal congress and approved. As the Reformation spread through the Swiss Confederation, the five central, catholic cantons felt increasingly isolated and they began to search for allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five Cantons formed die Christliche Vereinigung (the Christian Alliance) with Ferdinand of Austria on 22 April 1529. Tensions continued to rise between the Protestant and Catholic cantons. After numerous minor incidents and provocations from both sides, a Catholic priest was executed in the Thurgau in May 1528, and the Protestant pastor J. Keyser was burned at the stake in Schwyz in 1529. The last straw was the installation of a Catholic reeve at Baden, and Z√ºrich declared war on 8 June, occupied the Thurgau and the territories of the Abbey of St. Gall and marched to Kappel at the border to Zug. By mediation of the Federal Tagsatzung, bloodshed in what was known as the First War of Kappel was barely avoided. The peace agreement (Erster Landfriede) was not exactly favourable for the Catholic party, who had to dissolve its alliance with the Austrian Habsburgs. The Protestant cantons also demanded that the catholic cantons allow Protestant preachers into them, and imposed a trade embargo to try to force them to agree. In late September 1531, about 8,000 soldiers from the Five Cantons (including Uri) marched against Zurich and Zwingli to lift this embargo. When they met Zwingli's forces on 11 October 1531 at the Second War of Kappel, the catholic forces were victorious and Zwingli was killed. The peace treaty after the Second War of Kappel established that each canton could choose which religion to follow, and Uri remained Catholic. During the early modern era, the population of Uri increased slowly. The limited arable land in mountain valleys, disease and crop failures all reduced population growth. The plague broke out in the canton in 1348‚Äì49, 1517‚Äì18, 1574‚Äì75 and 1629. In 1742‚Äì43 and again 1770‚Äì71, crop failures combined with cattle diseases led to starvation and mass emigration. The consequences for the population were severe, in 1743 Uri had 9,828 inhabitants, but by the end of the 18th Century there were only 9,464 people. Modern history =Napoleonic period= Map of the Helvetic Republic The government of Uri spoke out against the ideals of the French Revolution and opposed any attempt to institute changes in Switzerland. In 1797, pro-revolutionary propaganda from France was intercepted and burned in Uri. In January 1798, French revolutionary forces invaded Switzerland. On 28 January 1798, Uri sent troops to support Bern against the invaders. However, in early March it advised the Bernese authorities to make concessions to the French government. Then on 4 and 5 March, Uri's troops refused to join the battle and instead withdrew. At the conference in Brunnen on 11 March Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Glarus and Zug decided to negotiate a separate peace with General Guillaume Brune. In preparation for these talks the council dissolved their protectorate over the Leventina valley on 14 March. In the following days, the negotiations fell through because the French insisted on creating an indivisible Swiss republic. On 11 April the victorious French announced the creation of the Helvetic Republic and gave the cantons twelve days to accept the new constitution. On 20 April, the council voted to defend the traditional constitution and to join the rebellious cantons of Schwyz, Nidwalden, Glarus and Zug. The uprising was quickly suppressed and on 5 May Uri agreed to accept the Helvetic Republic. The cantonal army was disarmed in September and the canton was occupied by French troops in October. During the Helvetic Republic, Uri was part of the Canton of Waldst√§tten, along with Zug, Obwalden, Nidwalden and the inner portions of Schwyz. The Leventina valley was given to the Canton of Ticino, which stripped Uri of its lands south of the Gotthard pass. Uri was divided into two districts, Andermatt and Altdorf. The government of Andermatt district supported the new, liberal constitution, while the government and people of Altdorf district opposed it. In April and May 1799, Franz Vincenz Schmid led an uprising against the occupying French army. This revolt, which gained support from the Leventina and Valais valleys, failed because they were unable to coordinate simultaneous uprisings in the other alpine cantons. After the uprising was put down, the victorious General Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult granted the people of Uri clemency for the rebellion. Suvorov Crossing the St. Gotthard Pass, an Alexander Kotzebue painting From June until the end of September 1799, troops of the Second Coalition fought the French in Uri. In connection with the uprising, Austrian troops invaded the Urseren and Reuss Valleys in late May and early June. The Austrians, together with a Capuchin friar named Paul Styger, attempted to restore the old cantonal government. However, in August the French position in the war began to improve. With the defeat of the Russian general Alexander Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zurich, the only other Coalition army, under Alexander Suvorov, was forced to retreat out of Switzerland though the alps in winter, a feat unheard of since the time of Hannibal. While he is considered a folk hero in Switzerland, his army stripped the villages of Uri bare of food and cattle. The damage from fighting, Suvorov's retreat and other disasters (including a fire that destroyed much of Altdorf in 1799) caused a famine in Uri. Although the government commissioner, Heinrich Zschokke, organized a relief effort to prevent starvation, it took years for Uri to repair the damage to the villages and towns. In October 1801, a new government came to power in the Helvetic Republic and in early November the Canton of Waldst√§tten was dissolved and Uri became a canton again. The governor, Josef Anton von Beroldingen, attempted unsuccessfully to bring the Leventina valley back into Uri. Half a year later, on 17 April 1802, the Unitarian party took power back in the Republic and revised the constitution once again. In early June, Uri rejected the newest constitution while at the same time French troops withdrew from Switzerland. Without the French army to suppress them, Uri and other rural populations successfully rebelled against the government in the Stecklikrieg. In response to the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, Napoleon issued the Act of Mediation in 1803. As part of the Act of Mediation, Uri regained its independence and all attempts towards religious or constitutional reform were resisted. =Toward the federal state= The Sonderbund War, Yellow ‚Äì Sonderbund, Green ‚Äì Confederates, Grey ‚Äì Neutral After the invasion of the Sixth Coalition into Switzerland on 29 December 1813, the Act of Mediation lost its power. While the neighbouring cantons of Schwyz and Nidwalden wanted to return to the organization of the Old Swiss Confederation, Uri was part of the Zurich-led party, which sought to reorganize the 19 cantons created by the Act. Uri also attempted, unsuccessful, to reincorporate the Leventina valley, but was only able to receive the rights to one-half of the taxes on all trade over Monte Piottino into the Leventina. On 5 May 1815 the Landsgemeinde approved the federal constitution. Uri then mediated between the Tagsatzung and Nidwalden, which had refused to recognize the treaty. Uri remained without an official constitution until 1820. The document included only six principles that were based on traditional practice and existing state laws. The government remained deeply conservative during the Restoration period. Discontent with the cantonal government collected until 1834 when a reform party demanded a number of liberal constitutional changes. The Landsgemeinde, however, rejected these calls for reform. In the 1840s, urban, Protestant liberals gained the majority in the Tagsatzung and proposed a new constitution. To protect their traditional religion and power structure, the seven conservative, catholic cantons formed a separate alliance or Sonderbund in 1843. In 1847, the Sonderbund broke with the Federal Government and the Sonderbund War broke out. During the conflict, Uri sent troops to participate in the fighting along the Reuss-Emme defensive line as well as on the foray over the Gotthard into Ticino. After the defeat of the Sonderbund troops in Gisikon on 23 November 1847 Uri withdrew from the alliance and surrendered on 28 November 1847. Two days later federal troops moved into Uri. =Within modern Switzerland= After the defeat of the Sonderbund, Uri supported the new Swiss Federal Constitution. They established a cantonal constitution that included some liberal changes including; the abolition of lifetime alderman positions, eliminating the privy council and secret council meetings and the establishment of a provisional executive council. The Landsgemeinde was the supreme sovereign power. The Cantonal Council, which included the presiding government councils and the Cantonal Court President, and the eleven-member Executive Council formed the legislative and executive branches. Ecclesiastical and school matters were under the Diocesan and Education Committees. The Catholic Church continued to enjoy privileges, but freedom of worship was now available for other faiths. The overall structure of the state remained cumbersome, because of the numerous commissions and the poor separation of powers. The new Federal Constitution of 1874, which was rejected by the voters of Uri, led to a total revision of the cantonal constitution in 1888. The new constitution streamlined the government and addressed many of the issues of the 1848 cantonal constitution. The Landsgemeinde continued to meet on a local level until the last one was held in B√∂tzlingen in the municipality of Schattdorf on 6 May 1928.History of Schattdorf The Christian Democratic Party (CVP) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) have dominated politics in Uri during the 20th Century.
